As a warrior practice Bind Wounds. It's a must for any melee class. 

Hunt Decaying skeletons. Necromancers always want bone chips and decaying
skeletons sometimes carry weapons, a splintering club and/or a cracked staff
esp. sell for good money.

Take up Tailoring. Silk swatches (2 spider silks combined) can be sold for a
good profit, Black Smither's want silk cords (3 silk threads (2 spiderling silks
combined) combined) for padding and patchwork armour (1-2 ruined pelts
(wolf=small, cat=medium, bear=large) combined with the desired pattern) is the
probably the best newbie armour about. The best thing about tailoring is you
don't need to put any practice points in it, just start making silk threads
and/or silk swatches in a small sewing kit. :)
