Lady Jennaii,

I play a wizard, an enchanter, and a bard; my lover plays a cleric and a
druid, and the room-mate a shaman.  After nearly three years of EQ, methinks
I know a small bit about healing and a good bit about crowd-control and
playing an evaccer.

Me, I'd say you were right on the money.

To me, bottom line is if the cleric says we go, we go.  And that's not just
because I don't want to sleep on the couch.  :)  I'll also say that if your
CC class says we go, we go; and that as the evaccer, it's my call on when we
go - but I usually defer to the group.  It's the burden on healing and
crowd-control to not hit the panic button unless you have to, but in my
experience most healers don't call for evacc until it's too late anyway.

In a recent LDON group, we had two paladins, a shaman, a cleric, a wizard,
and a ranger.  On on overpull, one of the paladins died.  Watching party
health bars, the second pallie got to 30 and the cleric said 'oom.'  I asked
if we should evacc and was told no.  The paladin died, and suddenly the
ranger was tanking one, the shaman two and the cleric and I were trying to
root-park.  I asked for evacc and was told no.  Ranger and shaman went down
to much cursing, cleric DA'd, I dropped an AOE snare and kited some of the
mobs off, asked cleric to meet me for evacc.  DA dropped and the cleric
promptly was stunned by a trap and died.  I evacced myself and waited for
the party at the entrance...  and was blamed for not evaccing.  I slept on
the couch.  :P

The moral of this story?  No matter what you do, someone is going to say
you're wrong, so do as you think is best and to hell with them.
