The NPCs are up last time I checked.

As to your odds of both winning a Gold Ticket *and* getting a Guise from 
the resulting hand in are rather slim.  So far I'm about 100k plat down 
trying for this without even seeing a Gold Ticket however I've personally 
heard of two people spending as little as 5k and getting Gold Ticket (1 
Guise and 1 Rubicite BP so even the prizes vary wildy as you can see.)
