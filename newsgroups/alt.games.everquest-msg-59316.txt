Personally I play both, they both have their advantages and
disadvantages.

I happen to think that EQ is still a good game but I really dislike
the amount of downtime and camping that goes on.  The High-end game
can be quite exciting and sometimes boring as hell.

Daoc is also a good game that I am having fun playing , whether PvE or
PvP (Realm Combat). The big annoyance for me at the moment is the
amount of running around you have to do to find mobs appropriate to
your lvl.

All this bullshit from the respective fanboys and people who just like
to jump in and blow steam up someones ass when they have not even
tried something is actually quite funny to read, but being human
beings we will naturally be drawn to disagree with someone who is not
saying what you think they should say.  

Hell, 30 bucks for a game that gives me a month of entertainment
compared to a movie that costs me 10 buck for 2 hours of entertainment
still sounds like a pretty good deal to me. Get the game, try it out
for awhile, if you don't like it then no big loss.

My opinion (take it for what it is worth) :  Deal with it guys, there
will be people who play both because they like the genre and there
will be people who play one or the other for a variety of reasons.  I
don't play a game because of what you think about it, I play it
because I happen to like it.

If that pisses you off then tough shit, I have enough friends anyway
and I don't have the time or the patience to deal with the idiots and
whiners of this world.
