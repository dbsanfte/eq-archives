I tried WoW and went back to EQ2 it just seemed more grown up. The zones r a 
pain in EQ2 but otherwise especially since last upgrade it is a good game 
and improving.

Quite a few new players have joined my EQ2 guild lately but if u started 
with EQ1 you could be a bit on your own - with the occasional alt for 
company.
