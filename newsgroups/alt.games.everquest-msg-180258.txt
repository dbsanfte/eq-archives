Then accusing me of being racist against any race is pretty stupid
when you don't know what race I am. Admit it, you read too much
between the lines and made assumptions. You sound like one of those
ass-hats that'll cry "RACIST!" if someone of a different race looks at
them funny. It's been my experience that the ones who'll cry "racist"
at every little thing are in fact racist themselves.
