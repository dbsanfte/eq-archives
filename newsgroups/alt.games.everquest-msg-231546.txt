I find the better GL's discuss potential new members with the group 
before inviting them.

You know, like "OK, how about Yousefel, 53 druid?"

Whereupon I can check my ignore list and say "er, she's on my ignore 
list for some reason, I can't remember, might just have been spamming, 
might have been a terrible player..."

If the leader didn't discuss the person before they showed up, and then 
there's a conflict, then I can't feel too bad if I'm forced to come down 
to a "she leaves or I do" situation.

Then again, I've gone ahead and grouped with the ignored person 
sometimes, it is a bit weird when they ask repeatedly for a buff and 
don't get it from me or so on... I suppose this is what it would be like 
to be forced to go on a journey with someone you are Shunning (only with 
the power to really not hear what they are saying, instead of just 
pretending not to)

Splendid
