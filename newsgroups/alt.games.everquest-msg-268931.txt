I don't know. I don't like the idea of guild decay going completely away.
For roleplaying aspects it just 'fits'. As you complete tasks in the city
your guild is looked upon more favorably (a la NYC firefighters after
9-11), however, when you stop or slow down your tasks the city looks to
others more in the public view (a la NYC firefighters now). I'd rather see
them slow the decay quite a bit than get rid of it completely.
