A bug was introduced in the last major patch before this one. It
allowed warders to equip weapons. From parsing posted on the
www.eqbeastlords.com forums, it looked like warders had very low H2H
skills. (They did MUCH better with weapons hitting more often and for
more damage)

From the first reports coming in it looks like they broke (or removed)
quading when they made the changes in this patch.
