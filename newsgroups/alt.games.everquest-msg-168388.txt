Why on earth would you lose the MA *on* the pull?

Mobs like AoW regenerate to 100% almost instantly once all agro is cleared.

Btw for future AoW attempts, its a good idea to make a few rallos zek
throw-away chars (eg level 1 warriors) with some throwing device on them
(shattering hammers works fine) and bind them in kael.  Park them in the
arena, and on wipes you can use them to move AoW away from the corpses.

If you move him and rez/rebuff in time, you can get a second shot.

No.  There are some BIG differences with Idol and AoW.   Namely HP, Flurry,
Slowable, AC, Mob Agro(this is key)

AoW does not rampage.  Were the melees fighting from the front and taking
riposte damage? (Very bad idea).. if not, its part of the mob agro that
makes AoW a very different fight to Idol.

You killed him unslowed.. imo that is enough justification to pop/poof AoW.
As long as you keep on killing Idol unslowed, nobody can argue that your
guild isn't AoW-capable.. it just takes a little perfecting of your strat

Same 5day repop on Statue.

I guess the point is, half the guilds on your server can kill Idol slowed..
but he drops no loot, has no faction, and you'd be deliberatly wasting an
AoW pop.  Its easy to see why aow farmers get pissed about wasted pops, but
easily killing Idol unslowed (ie u didnt lose half your raid and zerg a win)
is enough reason to them them to STFU and get off your back.
