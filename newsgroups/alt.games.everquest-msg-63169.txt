I had the same problem with the SB Live.  The new driver didn't work to fix
the problem for me, as a matter of fact it made things worse.  I started
getting bluescreens after updating the driver from Windows update for XP.
Other games started having problems too.  When I tried getting help from
Microsoft they said it was an issue with the card and to contact Creative.
Creative said it was a known issue with the SB Live and XP with no fix.  I
have a friend that has a SB Live 5.1 and didn't have this problem so, I got
a SB Audigy installed it and updated drivers with the new XP drivers on
Creative's web site.  No more problem.
