One other hint, from someone who didn't make it through.  If the zone
isn't empty yell to the zone and tell them you plan on running through and
don't know the way.  Two reasons,

Should you run the wrong way, you might/will create a really nasty train
that will probably kill a raiding group.
Should the raiding group need to run/evac you would hope they would shout
it first.  My level 45, fully buffed, shaman was taken down in about 4
steps from some caster from the Northern area that was trained to the
zone.  The group cleric rezed me, and told me to tell them next time so I
don't die.

There are places to recast invis/camo should you need to along the way.
