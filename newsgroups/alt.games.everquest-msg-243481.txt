Yeah, but those are accidents they can adjust. The bugs they are
talking about are pathing things and critters being stuck under the
world, like hill giants or the quarry for the langseax quest in
western karana, other things like mobs warping back to the home point
while still being kited etc. There were always a ton of pathing things
in the game which they now say are easy to fix with DX9, for some
reason.

It kind of sounds fishy to me, but I don't know anything about
programming or direct x really.
