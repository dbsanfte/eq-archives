It will be recieved by the majority like it always does when I submit a dev
team comment... "awesome new implementation...about frikkin time!".

People in here flame me alot, they hate me because I am uber and I don't
take sides with the regulars. That's why most of their posts are based on
silly comments (flames) and not the actual subject we are discussing. Fact
is alot of things I say or ideas has gone live into the game over the past
years, and most of my ideas and comments that went live have been greeted by
the majority of the EQ community. Some of the regulars here are also friends
of other regulars who back eachother up no matter if they are
"way-out-west", you will notice after spending some quality time in this NG
who are friends and who posts from an indiviual perspective.

If you look at my posts from an objective point of view, you will see I am
right everytime. Just like now.

UbeR... and you love it..rilly!
