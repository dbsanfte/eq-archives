In the LDoNs I've done in with my (now) 43 Paladin alt, the mobs
really didn't need slowing most of the time.  Mind, that char is
not some silly twink.  He's fairly lightly geared by today's
standards with everything easily attainable even by a first-time
player (incomplete set of mixed LDoN crafted plate, no haste item,
Orc Fang Ears, Golden Fire rings, and with a BABS he hunted solo
for his main weapon).

In other words, it's not, in my insufficiently humble opinion, all
that important that you land slow on those mobs, UNLESS your group
is mostly off-tanking for CC.

(I was once in a low DPS LDoN group with my main where the CC
tactic we fell into was:  1. Shaman debuffs add,  2. Shaman slows
add,  3. add runs over and smacks Shaman,  4. I assist Shaman and
stun add,  5. I heal Shaman as he moves away from stunned add,  6.
slowed add runs over and beats on me until main target dies.  That
allowed me to continue to beat on the main target except when I
was actually casting on the add or the Shaman.  I should mention
that it was an odd group:  60 SHD, 60 CLR, 60 SHM, 56 CLR, 56 PAL,
one of the 60s might have been 61, don't recall for sure, but you
can see we were desperate for every bit of DPS we could find.)

If you're determined to slow the mobs (it will be important at
higher level and in different venues) the advice about leading with
a debuff is good fora lot of situations, especially if you've got a
Warrior tank (or an incompetent Knight) as they cannot reliably
build aggro fast enough to cope with multiple resisted slows at the
start of a fight.
