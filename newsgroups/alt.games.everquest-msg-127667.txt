So I was chatting briefly with an ex guildmate bard, just in
passing since I saw her in the same zone.  She said
she'd never gotten the hang of charm kiting, which is
what I was doing at the time, and most of our discussion
centered around chant kiting.

She did, however, say that charm kiting was easy for me
since I didn't have to reapply charm with the song I was
using.  I'm fairly certain her bard is EBay or handmedown,
or at the very least heavily PL'd up into the 50s, her
former main is a 60 wizard IIRC... so its often not clear
she knows what she's talking about with lower level bard
information.

At the time I didn't think much of it, said that well none of
the things- I was charming were capable of killing interesting
targets in 18 seconds... and let it go at that.

Later though, I started thinking.  Occaisionally I've had some
unexpected results while kiting, that I'd not had an explaination
for.  Sometimes I'd decide to switch mobs, only to find that
something was going wrong and I'd charmed something other
than my target.

Experimenting some more with this, it seems that somehow
the song keeps the original pet targetted if you leave it running,
even though I've switched targets and am happily melee-ing
the same mob as my pet and my partner.

I didn't try enough variations to be sure of what was going
on.  Was it all just power of suggestion and some kind
of weird glitch?  Or does this really work?

Assuming it does work, do I have to leave charm running
in order to do so?  That takes 2/3rds of my general contribution
to the fray away.  Can I redo charm as long as I get it casting
again before the first one runs out, without need to retarget?

I know for sure I've switched charm targets once charm is
broken... do it all the time when my original pet is running
and our current victim (often the second or third in a row
that the pet has taken on) is still healthy enough to fight.

Does this trick -not- work with the 39 charm?  No use learning
to use it well if I'm going to have to stop that soon.
