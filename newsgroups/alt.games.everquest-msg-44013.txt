I do have a picture of a druid on my server who at one point ran
around with dark green legs, sleeves and gloves, and golden boots,
bracer and breastplate.
Personally, I find myself wanting to ditch my GE boots. I've wanted
coldain skin boots ever since I heard of them, but bought GE for
tradeskills' sake when I couldn't afford coldain skin. With my new
bracers, the gold boots clash so badly that I am wearing my old
gnomeskin boots when I hunt solo (I never reach full mana, so it
doesn't make any difference beyond looking miles better)
