Potential is a wonderful thing.

I am having trouble at work at the moment, now, so I have the potential to
take an FN-FAL into work and clean up so to speak, but that is all it is:
potential. I am pretty much insane - just not <that> insane. All the water
on earth has the potential to drown us all as well. All the monkeys on earth
have the potential to write Shakespeare given enough time. Like I said:
potential is a wonderful thing...

Personally I believe that any job or marriage lost due to EQ was pretty much
on shakey grounds to begin with. As an aside, out of all the MMOG on the
market at the moment I would hazard a guess that EQ is the least mindless
and repetitive, and I have played a lot of them in my EQ sabbatical which
just finished as well. If you are feeling burned out though - take a break,
it works wonders. My short term suggestion is Planetside btw - it was good
fun without the intensity of EQ, and without needing to re-learn a whole new
system/lore/world (hey - it's a shoot em up on steroids).

BTW - if you do go, CIHYS?
