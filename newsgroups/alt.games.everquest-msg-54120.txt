LOL this is your first pure caster, isn't it?  Forget all about AC, the goal
here is NOT to be hit, so AC is almost worthless.

Necros are interested in INT and Mana ONLY, until such time that you get
close to 200 INT, then and only then do you need to concern yourself with AC
or HP (my personal preference is HP since AC will always be a joke).

As to gear I don't BELIEVE necros get MUCH in the way of Necro-Only gear.
Anything a wizard or magician want you'll want as well.  Assuming this
section didn't go pay, and assuming you don't mind thousands of pop-up ads,
www.allakhazam.com used to have a good equipment database.
