Snipped, good story on why NOT to buy characters

You're not getting that character back, you lose.

What I'd do in this situation (as you have some of his personal details) I
shan't say but what I suggest you do is the following;

Email Verant, explain the situation, email any and all correspondence that
supports your story, give them proof that this account is not only
compromised but also that it has been sold and that you have been paying for
it and playing it.
You won't get your money, plat or the disputed account back but you will,
hopefully, get the account cancelled, he doesn't get to play either.

Not going to flame, I have a real life friend who bought a 60 cleric (and
has only ever played the 45th Druid on the account, go figure) as well as a
couple of hundred quid in Plat (/sigh) but you buy such things at you're own
risk.
It is not like buying a used car, the seller has no rights to sell, it's
more like buying stolen property and having it siezed.

The seller sounds like a c*ck for going back on a deal made and taking your
cash but you knew what you were doing left you with absolutely no rights, at
all. The reason the trade or sharing of accounts is banned is because Verant
do not want or need the shit that comes with disputes, this is also the
reason of the instant ban applied to compromised accounts.

Good luck in getting the account closed, you'll need a miracle to get the
account returned.
