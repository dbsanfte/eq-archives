D'uh. Because what happens BETWEEN the patches? Because daily patches
means daily respawns of usual week-long spawns? Or maybe, just maybe,
because I don't for one minute believe that Verant's definition of
'shortly' means 3-5 days. Given past experience, I'd say 2-3 weeks is
more accurate.

Have you never wanted to be the first in a zone? The first to find
something new?

I enjoy playing EQ. I want to play it the second PoP is released. Does
that mean you'll let me borrow your account key for the first week of
PoP, and replace it with a storebought one, say, a week after release,
once the patches have stopped, eqtraders has all the new tradeskill
recipes, eqatlas has all the new maps, safehouse has all the new strats
and quests? 

I also don't want to start PoP with a week long disadvantage to other
people at my level of playing.
