    Nope, just ENC/CLR. I got my copy oh-so-long-ago off a vendor - guess an
ENC was a little miffed at what they got with their spell turn-in.

    You say that now, but wait for your first "bad resist". ;-)

    As you may have noticed, this spell also doesn't require line-of-sight.
Last night, when during a ring event a clog of seven mobs (level 62 to 65)
built up in one area, I sent a rogue in to target for me and /assisted off
him to Pacification them, one after the other. By the time I got a resist
and aggro, most of the clump was Pacificationed. Monk, single pull at will
please!

    If it helps stop the grin, it'll be nerfed. Right now it's actually a
useful tool. And clerics can't get utility!!!
