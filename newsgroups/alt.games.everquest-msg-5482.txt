...and Wes said here would come the flames.

You might be disappointed in what you get if you are leveled so quickly.
Like someone mentioned leveling quickly often leaves your skills behind.
You might find that someone who died ten times at level 30 has a higher
skills rating than some who didn't die at all. Plus I think in the
attitude you are missing the point of the game somehow. It matters
little what level you are and matters much if you are enjoying the game.
What ever level you may be there is a world just for your level. It's
all the same proportionately.
