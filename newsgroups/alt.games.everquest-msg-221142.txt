I have always believed that SoE programmed that in.
The newly levelled or the about to level players become tastier
targets then someone who right next to you who is sitting and at 5% hp
;.... hehe

I have actually had that happened to me.. was with a ranger that took
a severe beating in PC while my beastlord came through unscathed.
He was about 10% health and sitting and I was full health and STANDING
behind him when a mass of fiends went right passed him and commenced
to beating on me. 
I asked him later and yeah he was just as kos to them as me, but I was
about 5% from levelling and he was about halfway thru level and we
were both the same level.. so go figure ;-)

Hehe... when my mage or beastlord are soloing.. the time they tend to
die the most is just after gaining a level or just at the end of one.
