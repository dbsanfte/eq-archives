I remember most vividly when Plane of Fear came out. Me and my friends 
were about level 15, and we already felt like we're big boys -- we could 
kill just about anything in Crushbone, and even kill the named bandit in 
Butcherblock.
One of my friends suggested that we go to take a peek into PoF with our 
regular group, and see if we can find anything that we can kill there 
(well, maybe if we get REALLY buffed...) I refused, and compared my 
undertanding of PoF to a whole zone filled with caster Hill Giants, i.e. 
totally impossible to survive :)
And a few months later, my bard was soloing multiple HGs. I was *really* 
wishing at that point that I was right before :)
