    In a melee heavy group, that would cost experience, no matter how good
the enchanter was, or what his excuse was, up to and including "I dont have
kei cos i dont believe in it"

    Like I've said before, if he shone through in other ways I'd probably
dismiss it as a quirk and put up with it.

    When have I ever told anyone their approach wont work? OR gone on about
the 50+ game or the 60+ game? I've commented on what I *have* seen. You
*are* adopting the uber elitist attitude and it's flawed, no matter how many
times you can squeeze "fuck" into a paragraph.
