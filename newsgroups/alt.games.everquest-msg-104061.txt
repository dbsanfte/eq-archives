Newbie shaman question:  What is the twink gear for shaman?  =)

As for what class is good for high level, it does seem shaman ranks
right up there.  Our smallest guild (mostly level 50+) does not have a
shaman but fortunately have an epiced shaman friend.  We have 4
clerics and 4 enchanters and I'm one of the clerics.  I wish I could
get my shaman up in level faster (only level 20 right now!).  As the
lowest level cleric I just sit around most of the time or nuke (in
which case I'd rather play a dedicated nuker).  And when my cleric
can't find a group, well, I have to log on an alt if I want to play eq
:)
