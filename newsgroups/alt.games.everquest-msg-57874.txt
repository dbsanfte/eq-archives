This poor guy has grown up in the windows world and must not know that it
dosen't take 512M RAM, 2G CPU and a 80G hard drive to run non windows
applications.

I ran a 300+ user ISP server on an intel P2 100Mhz with 64M and 2  1G SCSI
hard drives and had more power than my users could use up. I never had lags
or other slowdowns even when all 32 56K modems were in use.

I would suspect that each server name that Verant has is indeed that - 1
server. It might even be 2 or 3 server names per actual Hard server. I only
base that on the poor performance that plagues them from time to time.

Just my 2 cents and 28 years of exp.
