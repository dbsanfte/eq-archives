Everlore did something even worse . It joined a cooperative of many diffrent
websites of which almost no one would ever use more than one of . It then
inflated the price tremendously . Bandwith has a cost but was free for so
long because that cost is very close to negligible . You dont even begin to
notice untill you get 1000s of hits per day and those users actually want to
download many diffrent and varied pages of high density content.

My biggest beef with the pay for view websites is not that they are pay for
view but that they expect the 1% of payers to pay for the 99% of nonpayers.
