I recently changed from Comcast Cable (Formerly ATT Broadband) to SBC
Yahoo DSL. Since then, whenever I attempt to log on to Everquest, I
get a "Error 1001, can't connect to Everquest Login Server, please try
again shortly." Anything I should do? I though about reinstalling it
but I've got a lot of expansions so I'd like to hear your opinions
first
