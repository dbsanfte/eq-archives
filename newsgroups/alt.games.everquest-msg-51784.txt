Bard would need very minimal equipment to get into a group. A lot of the
time when I group, I'm just playing catana on my lute, so no swords or armor
required. (crowd control might get messy).

If I were to reequip my bard in banded and fs weapons, and go looking for a
group in DL, I would find one easily. People just dont care, as long as the
manasong flows. I might cause some amusement with my useless gear, but I
very much doubt it would stop me getting into parties.
