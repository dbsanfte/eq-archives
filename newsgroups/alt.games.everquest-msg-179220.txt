Unless you _really_ have your heart set on skilling up like this, you're
making it incredibly more difficult for yourself than it needs to be.

Patty Melts til they trivial, then Misty Thicket Picnics til 250.  Save up
all your foraged vegetables, and have friends and guildmates save 'em up.
Keep a few stacks of foraged fruit in the bank.  And go collect a stack of
brownie parts from steamfont, should take you 2 hours at the most and will
be enough for 2000 combines (barring any failures slicing your cake, grrrr).
By far the easiest stuff to make as far as foraging and farming goes.

The only caveat is that the picnics require brewing, tailoring and smithing
to be around 100.  Getting skills to 100 usually only takes about an hour
and less then 100pp though (tailoring requires a bit more pp if you decide
to skill up entirely on woven mandrake).  The good news is that even at the
lowest prices i'm hearing, the picnics sell to players for at least 3x cost.
And even patty melts will sell back to players for way over cost (guildie of
mine who's trying to skill up baking sold her patty melts at 1pp each in
about 20 minutes.  She had about 8 stacks).

/gu anybody want some picnics?

PS: I know jum jum spiced beer trivials at 168.  But just power-brewing to
100 should give enough of a success rate that they won't be tearing their
hair out while it naturally skills up to 168 just from making the beer for
the picnics.
