Well, if they are behaving, and hiding from the guildmates, fine, if
they are being morons and hiding guildstatus....

Reminds me of a guild I encountered 3 times negatively.

SK Auctiioning 10 slotters. 

100pp OBO

he shouts I'll sell mine for 80, 

75 pp OBO
(At this point I've got 6, and need the 250pp for the gems for my Ivy
etched bp)

He shouts 65pp

I come back 50pp

he comes back 35pp

I /tell him I'll take them

he /shouts anybody but standail.

I give up and leave.  

Second incident, hunting Gnoll ledge in Highpass.  There couple few
hours, and He has a group, other side of the ledge, decides to accuse us
of KSing/camp stealing from him.

Passing through rivervale here shouts about Him again KSing Goblin
camp(he's 19)  There is a group of halflings trying to xp. He is a
warrior. Do a guildstat, thinking to get with his guild. get XXXXX is
leader of XXXXX GUILD.  Decide to pass the word to our guild and allied
guilds to beware.
