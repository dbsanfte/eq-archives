Could you *sound* any more rabidly fanatical?

Sounds like DAoC.

Really?

You know we can check this, right?

"I played this a lot in beta and boy it frustrated me. I stopped
playing because I already played one Sci Fi game made by a European
company that kept changing things right up to and during release.
There are still balance issues and bugs. Having said that, I might
check in in 6 months because Reaktor seems to be trying and does take
an active interest in their players, unlike Funcom. It has a skill
based system and tradeskills are viable, but you still are killing
things mostly. It does have a large Pvp element also."

"Neocron unfortunately turned me off.The AI in the game is very bad
and the gaining of experience while your chip is in place is slow and
tedious.The places like the sewers are nice for about 30 minutes than
you want to get the hell out.The apartments and the nudity in
Pepperpark was cool for about 10 minutes than that too waned.Gankers
waiting to pick you off another wonderful aspect of the game.I gave up
soon before the game went live in Germany .AO is ten times better if
you want a game with depth and diversity."

" Yeah, AC2 and Neo didn't bring anything new to the MMO world in
terms of gameplay."


That took me about 30 seconds to find.

I think you better reevaluate your orgasmic spasming over the game. I
haven't tried it, it could be great, but it obviously isn't as widely
acclaimed as you'd have people believe.

But, thanks for coming and preaching the good word. God knows we
haven't seen many zealots around here lately to convert us unwashed
masses. :-)
