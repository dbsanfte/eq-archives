The game uses "frenzy" as a word for aggro in the description of the Lull line
if you click on the spell now.  I don't see how that definition would fit in
with the text you quote here.

Frenzy is also an ability certain mobs have where they get in a whole slew of
extra hits... but I really don't remember Llrodd having that sort of ability.

In fact, I can't think of anything at all special about Llrodd, he's just a
relatively high level mob (compared to the mobs around him) on a short timer
that is handy for leveling up in the 10ish range.  He's part of a DE quest in
befallen IIRC, but is killed far more often than he's used for quests.  On the
other hand, he's hardly "incredible" experience, just perfectly normal old
world exp, same for him as for killing any other mob his level in the same
zone  (just that other mobs his level are located down deeper inside the zone,
and have buddies)
