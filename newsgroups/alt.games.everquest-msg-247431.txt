Didn't mean it that way at all, but it has to be an ATI driver problem.
No driver is perfect, can't be. In this case, and several others I found
on the net, ATI drivers have had problems with EQ and there was one
other game mentioned that slips my mind at the moment. The symptom is
the game cannot find a 3D device. It has only surfaced since the DX9
patch. ATI has a kind of checklist to run through on their website, and
at the end they mention that if it still doesn't solve the problem, to
contact their Customer Care.
