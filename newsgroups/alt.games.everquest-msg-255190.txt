I think that does raise a valid concern.  As Brenlo points out, everyone
in the game groups. Grouping is at the heart and soul of the game, so the
two kinds of players really shouldn't be so radically different that the
difference feels like the difference between, oh, a level 60 and level 65.
Raiders deserve to be better, but making it so they eventually would only
want to group with their own "kind" is not healthy for the game.
