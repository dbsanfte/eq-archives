EVERYONE who helped (well, mark and richard especially, if not
completely...), THANKS!


i have 2 issues remaining that i won't bother to qualify, but here they are:
1 - there's a piece of "unknown" hardware that pops up as being discovered,
but every piece of hardware i installed came through perfectly and the
software all fits and everything ... so i have no idea what that unknown
thing is, so i disabled notification and i'm hoping to forget it exists =P
but it still shows up in my device manager ...


2 - for windows, i just borrowed a CD ... and i used the cd key it came with
to install, but i'm getting bugged to activate ... and i don't mind
admitting that i found out how to no longer be bothered by that, but i need
service pack 2 and ... well, you can guess where i'm at ...


oh, and i lied:

3 - i have a dual core processor, and it seems alright, but it isn't nearly
as nifty as i'd hoped it would be - it's an AMD 4200 and it slows down when
i turn on too many things ... i was hoping for an unslowable chip =( oh
well... i only mention this because i think i heard something about a
process required to take full advantage of a dual core chip, though i can't
recall if that was for a new-ish system or for an older system that's been
upgrade ... is there anything i need to do? and is it recommended to
overclock? will i notice a difference? i have great cooling in the system
and i installed the cpu temperature probe on the heatsink (is that bad? was
it supposed to touch the cpu? it seems to be close-ish if not "good enough"
and it reads 28 degress (C)...and is heat the only consideration with
oc'ing? ) ... so i'm not sure if it's worth it interms of risk / reward to
bother trying it

thanks again!
