I don't see how GFLuxing is an exploit.  It takes advantage of the side effects
of one of the spells in the game and natural features of the zone geometry;
high buildings and open doorways.  Logging out and back in in that corner
in SG is an exploit, since the only reason it works is the safety mechanism
designed to prevent you being trapped under the world.  But GFlux is supposed
to toss you up in the air, and you aren't going thru any supposedly solid walls
or anything with it, just up onto higher and higher ledges, then using Levitate
(another spell line) to glide from one ledge to another.  Then you use a third
spell line, COTH, to get the rest of your group to a previously unreachable
location.  Hard work, clever... but doesn't seem to me it abuses any portion
of the game mechanics.

Wriggling thru the Hole is slightly more debateable, but if you look there
IS a visible gap there, surely if this wasn't intended they could make it
a more solid doorway.  As it stands, the alternate plan to get into the
Hole is to squeeze thru a hole... too perfect a pun to be unintended.
