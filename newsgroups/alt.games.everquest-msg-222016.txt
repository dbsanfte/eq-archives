I tried this approach with my usual group - I started by demanding an
extra 20% of the loot, double random roll on any item, a roll on every
item even if I had already won a previous roll and their undieing
gratitude that a cleric would lower himself to group with them.

Eventually we negotiated down to them allowing me to group with them,
an equal share of everything, and the odd appreciative comment when my
heals stopped them dieing.
