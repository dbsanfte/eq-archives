i just bought daoc ....
the thing is every thing i was running away from eq is what i thought  that
daoc offered. once i had it ,it seemed pale .my Norwegian berserker had dual
wield at 5 lev? maybe its to early to judge?it feels like ....when you crash
at a friends house, its familiar but not comfortable.the first rush of the
orc hill near kelithin.cant be taken from my mind.there are no battles like
this for newbies in daoc as far as i know.the things like binding that we
hate for asking for from a caster that can do it gives you a better sense of
community then going to a bind stone and bindig yourself.the interplay is
what is beautiful about eq!..........anyway don't mind me im drunk.,
