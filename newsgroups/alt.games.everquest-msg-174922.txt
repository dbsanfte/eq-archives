I logged on the other day for the first time in a month and a half,
still trying to decide if I was staying with EQ after almost 4 years.

I discovered that my buddy had borrowed 15k to buy something, no
sweat - he has 2 ethereal parchments that he hasn't turned in (he's
60) so I told him to turn them into the mage guy (Somat) he got
Ward of Xegony (!!!) and Belt of MagiKot (!).  So forgave some of
the debt for the spells.

As a result - I'd put my DPS over the length of the trial against
any rogue who isn't a big raider (IE top 4 or 5 guilds).

Horse + Mod Rod + R-Click Nuke + Pet

Now, with the implosion of my old guild, I have to start putting
together folks who can do the trial.

(oh, btw, not leaving - hooked again.)
