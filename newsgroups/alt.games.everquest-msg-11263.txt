On my ranger I have melee button and range attack button right next to
each other. I almost always use the autoattack key 'a' to attack, but
occasionally I will melee, back-off fire arrows, melee, fire arrows, and
it is convenient, on occasion, to select/unselect it, and it helps me to
see if I have left auto-attack on when I don't want it on.

If I did not find it useful it would not be there, in fact on my top 4
characters:

Ranger has an autoattack hot key
Enchanter does not
Druid does not
Monk has an autoattack hot key
