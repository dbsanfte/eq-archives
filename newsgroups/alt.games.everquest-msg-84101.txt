Except that verant says that lil suzie and lil timmy can each play for
an hour on the same account if they are in the same family BUT if they
are not in the same family verant is not really losing money. The
difference is illustrated by the reason for this person's post in the
first place, that if friends or family members want to play at the
SAME time they pay for it.

They sell more accounts at full price because of this problem, so why
would they change it? If you gave families a price break friends would
get it to which would equal the loss of money. Its really too hard to
verify in this possible multiple IP of home broadband user age that
people are even at the same house.
