I've finally have two Forest Loops.  Woohoo!  =)  Now I'm wondering what
would be best to do.  I'm currently half way through level 31.  Should I
take a break from leveling and go after the gear that is now easier for me
to get or keep leveling to say at least 34th, if not 35th (so I can see
while I meditate)?  I'm just moved to Overthere last night.  Supposedly good
XP in that zone ... or so said the leader that recruited me ... though my
group and I got quickly killed a number of times.  A Sarnek berserker once
popped and killed our enchanter in less time than it took me to stand up and
cast.  :-P

So what do people recommend?  Get better gear to level faster or level to
have an easier time getting gear?  Just FYI, I'm a Halfling cleric.

LEVELING:

Overthere?  Some place better?

EQUIPMENT:

The following is what I have on me and what I'm thinking of going after.
Comments and suggestions welcomed.  I guess whether to continue leveling or
go gear hunting would be dependent on how good of gear I've got below and my
total overall stats.  So how good are they for a 31st level Halfling cleric?
Current stat totals follow gear.
