I'd wager the warrior had the highest HP and probably the highest AC; he 
was wearing some pretty slick looking gear and was the only one in the 
group with Temp, plus had HOS in the bargain.  On the other hand, he 
very likely sped thru the levels faster than the rest of us, and 
probably had worse Defense and parry/dodge skills.  At levels below 39, 
HP totals don't really mean much to a healer anyway, other than "time 
till death if I stop healing", with no CHeal, you can easily get full 
efficiency from your heals as long as the MT has more HP than your 
biggest heal.  AC and avoidance mean more... along with which table you 
are on; warriors and knights with the same skills and AC take less 
damage from mobs than chain classes or even than bards and clerics, who 
despite wearing plate armor get to enjoy about the same protection from 
mobs smashing them around as a druid.

Not keeping aggro reliably is a more important issue.. but in this case 
the warrior wasn't so much losing aggro to the cleric, as to me; double 
attacking up to 52 a blow, and doing up to triple frenzy at up to 60 a 
blow, a lucky run spikes my damage up far enough to get the love pretty 
easily; the SK rarely lost aggro and rapidly got it back when he did, 
the warrior on the other hand I'd have to Jolt to ditch the mob's 
attention most of the time.

This was a very free wheeling group; the only thing the enchanter and I 
were trying to do was work on her mezzing skills, not hold a symposium 
on all the ways a group can be improved.  Normally the MA was me, the 
puller, and the MT was whoever I thought would make a good MT, either 
I'd pick target and then let him have the beating, or I'd let him pick, 
assist him, and call for everyone to assist me.  I often found when we 
let someone else be MA that I'd assist him for next target, then he'd 
switch again, so he and I would end up waking two seperate mobs.  Then 
I'd say "you switched targets!" and he'd be amazed that I could tell...

I don't mind letting someone who isnt the theoretical best tank in the 
group be the MT; everyone needs to learn, after all, and the tank 
classes need to get their various defensive skills up; its not fair that 
the most twinked and uber buffed characters end up getting beat on the most.

Well, as I said, I was doing the job, and I could use all the practice I 
can get at doing it well (not skill ups, its automaticly successful 
unless resisted, but when to do it, where I need to be facing, what 
enough of a hill to block the shot looks like, and so on)  I was just 
surprised that the snare classes didn't automatically assume that it 
would be their job; how many people are aware that berserkers are a 
snare class?
