I had a brief bug that would cast gate when i used my left arrow and i 
ended up deleting it from the spellbook to get it to stop. Went back and 
redownloaded and it cleared up. Makes me appreciate my faithstone=)

Has not reoccurred, but my spell gems got rearranged once, thought it 
was a bug but it was hubby playing a trick on me. So I dyed his monk 
pink and green=)
