Hello.

I'm offering my services as a grandmaster elven smith on Terris-Thule. I can
create all of the high elven cultural (chain and plate, enchanted and
enchanted/imbued).
My offer is pretty simple. You have 2 options.

1) Buy a piece directly. The cost is 1500 per ring for chain or 2000 per
sheet for plate. This offer is limited by my supplies, so I may not be able
to instantly produce the requested piece(s).

2) Supply all ingrediants for an attempt at a piece. If I succeed, you
supply 1 extra temper (see below) for the piece. If I fail, then you can
either walk away or give enough for a 2nd attempt (with appropriate temper
for success).


To create a piece of chain requires:
1-3 enchanted rings
1 Silk Swatch
1 pattern
1 moonlight temper
1 Imbued Emerald (optional)
1 Elven Smith Hammer (I have this)

For plate pieces:
1-3 enchanted sheets
1 enchanted chain jointing
1 leather padding
1 mold
1 moonlight temper
1 imbued emerald (optional)
1 Elven Smithy Hammer (I have this)

The number of rings/sheets required is:
1 - Mask, Bracer, Collar, Boots
2 - Arms, Guants, Waist, Shoulders, Helm
3 - BP, Legs, Cloak

to create the Moonlight Temper you need:
1 Morning Dew (foraged in Greater/Lesser Faydark)
1 Swirling Mist (found off mist/steam elementals in Steamfont/Nahena)
2 Essence of Moonlight (found off vampires at night in Mistmoore)

If you supply these, I'll do the brewing for free (170+ skill, fail about 1
in 30)

I have in stock a supply of enchanted rings, sheets, and jointings. If you
go for option 2 above, I'll sell you premade rings/jointing for 50pp each
and premade sheets for 150pp each. If you choose to supply the metal
yourself (getting a 49+ enchanter to enchant it) keep in mind it requires
extra morning dew to forge.

If you have any questions, send them to me online as Eleena.
