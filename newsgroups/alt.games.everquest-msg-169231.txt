I'm not much into raids. but here goes from my 54 chanter point of view.

Used to play one before kunark, couldn't get past 35, so underpowered. -
may have changed.

Only if you think "Overpowered" = getting killified every 5 minutes.
Then yes, the 2nd most overpowered class. If you ballance it against
their deathwish, then balanced.  Only need one in a group ever, and only
a couple on any raid. Also a hard job.

Balanced - worst soloer in the game, best or 2nd best damage output in
groups.

yep.

Overpowered - most wanted class for groups, raids, rezing, can solo some
(moreso for kai addicts) - balanced some by utter mind numbing play.

Can't solo well & has no goodies, needs a group, most sought after tank
- underpowered Imho for the disads.

*Scratches head* - Bard is waaaay overpowered, does almost everything an
enchanter can, has more hp, better armor, is more sought after for
raids, can solo better, heal, no medding etc. I can tell you my bard
feels like a god compared to my enchanter at the same level.  
Balanced by the fact that they cause carpal tunnel syndrome in record
time.  I can't play more than a few hours a week or my hands start
killing me. - o.k. maybe they are balanced when you consider this.

slightly less able then necros, so sure.

> � Druid

Slightly underpowered mainly because EQ crawls with them (mostly bad
apples), easiest class to play imho and makes it hard to get in groups,
raids, get their items ets.

Wizards are very very powerful, but they have severe problems.  I'll
agree.

> � Ranger
> Balanced

Uh. Underpowered.  This is my pick for most underpowered class.  I feel
sorry for rangers.

Don't have enough experience with them, but I know they are a PVP
favorite.

Maybe, I've got mixed feelings.  A well played paladin is wonderfull to
behold, but for the most part seem a little frail.
