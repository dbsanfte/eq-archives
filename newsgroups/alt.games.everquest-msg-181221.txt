No.

No, Yes.

Planes of power does not, really what you want is that gold tin thing
unless you can get Luclin and POP cheaper than it (and still have old
cds/account ) Pop itself just also includes the Old EQ world (
original before kunark)

EQ is on its last legs perpetually. They add on just enough to get
people to stay around. Some things have improved greatly, like C3 for
"donations" in the nexus (more of a player change than an intended
verant change) nearly eliminating downtime. Really though, you still
have that same old game you played with very little change in the old
world and subsequent additions in four years. This new ykesha thing
with frogs in grobb is one of the only major changes to an existing
zone in forever, the thing is it ends up being moot since it doesn't
change the game at all. You can improve faction with the frogs to..
improve faction with the frogs.. yay. There are no "great" quests or
any underlying reason to do so.

The major problem is still the old campfest. Too much gear drops off a
certain mob, in a certain zone, which is too highly desired and
overcamped if the stuff is good (speaking generally about all content)
This lack of randomness basically makes the game stale. EQ would seem
shiney and new for you with luclin and POP, until you exhausted the
new content in a couple months. Then you'd be left with the same old
familar and too seldom changing game.

All of the same reasons you left two years ago are likely to exist
today. SWG is right around the corner, as well as some other titles.
I'd not get back into this.
