It does make a sort of sense.  As time passes, I would expect two things to 
happen.  First the world will change.  I believe the Verant has always 
maintained that Norrath is a dynamic world so the HH goblins 'liberating' 
Runnyeye indicates that Norrath has a living history (though it moves 
slowly).  Secondly, as the server ages, I would expect that certain areas, 
like Blackburrow (not yet), Runnyeye, Splitpaw, and so on would change, 
though not to invasions.  I would expect these sites' denizens to become 
tougher as THEY gain experience..
