Rapier main, Tombcarver off.  DW skill will raise faster that way, and
you need higher damage weapon in the main hand for bigger
backstabs (within reason, of course...a 9/40 weapon is much crummier
than a 8/27 one :-)  ).  This also assumes, and I DON'T remember
off the top of my head, that the Rapier is a 6/23 weapon or so.
If I'm wrong, and it's a 5 dmg piercer, by all means keep TC
in the main hand...UNLESS you're in a group and have the leeway
to work on DW skill for a while.  TC is a great weapon for that.

I don't remember the WotFS that well.  Sounds like a slasher, but
again, I just don't remember.

Yes, this is why VI put in Evade...rogues dying after the massive
aggro from even a MISSED backstab was a huge pain in the ass
pre-Kunark.  That's why you could go 2 weeks without even seeing
another rogue back then.

If you draw aggro, evade, and hope you're not moving or getting hit
right at that moment.  You can figure out the timing pretty easy.

Yes, that's because rogues aren't tanks.  They're more of
a tank than a wizard, of course, but my alt rogue is still
having a hard time with her defense skill getting raised simply
because her job is to backstab, and whenever things turn
around to hit her 90% of the time she'll just evade it off.  Hard
to work on Defense when you never get hit.  Let the slow
folks tank ;-).

I imagine you mean on another character.  Tell that rogue to evade.

Wrong solution...a rogue's job is to do damage.  If you stop attacking,
you're not doing your job.  Might as well tell the tank not to taunt and
the cleric not to heal.  Few mobs during regular play will eat through
your HPS fast enough that Evade doesn't recycle...but 10 seconds getting
pounded on is vastly preferable to the old "backstab for 1 point of damage
at level 50 and then die on the spot" routine.
