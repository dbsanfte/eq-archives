Actually, my view is I would like to see a world without the hate and
prejudice. As opposed to most idealists, I don't want to see one where
everyone agrees - that'd be a dull, stale world that would burn itself
out quickly. One where people disagree, but they can debate and handle
those disagreements without resulting to such childishness would be my
idea of a perfect society.
