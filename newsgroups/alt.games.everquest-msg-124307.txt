Alright, every once and a while someone posts one of these, and they always
crack me up and make my day a bit brighter, so i was hoping I could get some
reposts and new posts.  I'm looking for those times when you catch yourself
in real life, doing something EQ related, or mentioning something EQy when
no one around would have any idea what your talking about.  Anyways, I bet
most people here know what im talking about, so post a few so whoever
doesn't know what i'm talking about will understand.. ok, now that i've even
confused myself, i'm going to sleep.
