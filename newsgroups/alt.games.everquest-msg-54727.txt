Ek is good from 12 to 25

OOT has the aviak isle, good for fear kiting providing you plan it so your
feard mob doesnt pass another aviak as they then add. They are very good exp
and you can always jump onto a canoe and row away to clear aggro. Also in
this zone is the goblin isle. Lot of goblins so may cause adds if not
careful and next to it is the gargoyle isle

Kill the fisherman in NRO for damn fine exp and there is a mob in the
Freeport inn that is also a doddle, cant remember name will post later

Lfay for bandit sisters?

Dagnors Cauldron is rarely occupied and a careful hunter can make good exp
here

Orcs camps in SRO at earlier levels, with so many chanters passing through
theportal you'll get a clarity every now and then )

Steamfont is good for the skeles at the big cog near mino caves

Casters realm has some good play guides for Necro class and Eq Necros is
very good
