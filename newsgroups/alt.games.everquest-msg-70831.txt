Hello all, I *think* I'm a first-time poster to this group.  Been lurking
here and the strat games group for years, though.  I've been playing EQ
since a couple of weeks after the launch of Kunark.  My main is a level 52.5
cleric named Kildayan on Morell Thule.  Now that I've introduced myself....

Any thoughts on my chances of ever obtaining the cleric epic?  I'm recently
unguilded from a smaller guild, no guild as of now.  I've also been led to
understand that there's a waiting list longer than a Kael Arena mob's hate
list for parts of the cleric epic.  Other than the obvious prestige, is it
really worth the effort, camping, and waiting in line to get the epic which
clicks a spell I'll eventually be able to cast anyway?  Any advice on
obtaining the epic without joining an uber guild?

Also, since Luclin launched, I've acquired 2 skill points and spent them
both on innate wisdom.  Any better way I could have spent this exp in your
(collective) opinion?

Kildayan Hateomatic, level 52 cleric of Innoruuk
Morell Thule server
