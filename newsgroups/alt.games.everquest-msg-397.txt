Bah, it's not even a good troll anymore.   We had one post in the Jordan
newsgroup after Winter's Heart.   The thread may have gotten a few
responses, but the responses were all people mocking the poster
unmercifuly, then hijacking the thread for friendly banter among the
regulars.   The troll didn't even manage to get one person upset.
Almost a negative score on the troll-o-meter.
