I have sold them for 150pp to 200pp. I usually sell them in less than
five minutes. They are a popular item. Never had a problem finding a
buyer for the price. Buying, I have seen them cheaper, I have bought
one for 85pp and resold it for 200pp. Capitialism, love it, learn it,
live it!
 
I will try /auc Stien of Maggok 250pp PST
and see how long the sale lasts.
