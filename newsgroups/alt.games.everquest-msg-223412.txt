Well yes it is....the key is nothing to do with the install. Its there to
set up the account for play access. Since the original owner can always
reactivate the account for themselves any time in the future it is tied
specifically to them.

You can use it for install purposes. However unless you can persuade SOE
to sell you a key for account acess then that really is it. You might try
contacting them and seeing if they will do that but I feel its unlikely
since they would rather sell you the latest multipack.

The maps may also be out of date depending on what is in that Deluxe pack.
