Last weekend was the first time that I really felt I got *more* experience 
in 
a group than I could have gotten solo in the same amount of time. Granted, 
I'm 
a monk, and my solo downtime is a lot less due to mend. If I picked the 
right 
blues to fight I had minimal downtime, and was very steadily gaining 
experience.

My biggest issue with grouping is all the downtime.. whether people go AFK 
or 
LD, or we are waiting for the last two people to show up, or someone has to 
run to sell, or whatever. I've been invited to groups where we didn't start 
fighting until almost AN HOUR later! The "group = more exp" equation only 
works some of the time. Especially if you are only fighting blues. A bad 
group 
in OT pulling sporadic yellows & reds would still be good exp. But..

Earlier this week I had trouble getting a group in CC. Not a lot of people, 
and the existing groups were full. I got invited into a group.. and we sat 
around, and sat around and sat around. Then we finally go to the geonids to 
fight for a while. We killed maybe 5 before the 46 shaman who had been at 
the 
front of the tunnel came back and kicked us out. (I wasn't sure about us 
going 
to the back of the tunnel, but since the tunnel was fully popped as we went 
by, I figured he wasn't keeping up with the spawn and we could share.. but 
he 
apparently wanted the whole thing. The experience was pitiful, so I was 
happy 
to leave. 15 minute spawn time? Ugh..). Anyhow, I got all of 1/2 blue bubble 
of exp in an hour and a half (in hell). I wanted to scream..

Anyhow, yeah the experience CAN be good in groups.. but it can royally suck 
as 
well. I blew through 30 solo.. 35 has been a real drag grouped. My goal for 
this weekend is to get the remaining 2 yellows of 35, and at least 1 yellow 
into 36. We'll see.. <sigh>
