Due to the way the "skill trees" in WoW are implemented, class dynamics (and
thus group dynamics) have no need to change as you get higher level.  Using
your reference as an example, the enchanter class changes quite a lot from
lower levels to higher levels in EQ, comparatively speaking.

I would count all those as positives as well.  In spite of that, there is
*something* wrong with WoW in my opinion.  I get the sense that it's just a
touch too easy.  In EQ, I'm "high end" and still get my ass handed to me if I do
something stupid.  In WoW, I was baseline, and could play with reckless
abandon.  Some people probably see that as a positive, but I prefer a little
more risk to go with my reward.
