Yes, sometimes you can get two spell effects in your window that appear to
stack but actually do not. It used to be that if you can Invis on yourself
and then have someone cast Invis Vs. Undead on you, you'd get both spell
effects in your buff window but only the regular invis would be in effect.

For haste isn't there a three effect limit? You can have one item haste, one
spell haste and one bard haste. I know there's something also about a Bard
song taking you over the cap, but I'm not sure what that's about exactly.
You cannot, AFAIK, have two haste spell effects active at the same time,
even if they do show up in your buff window together.
