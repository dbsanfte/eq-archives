Not quite.
If the class gets Bash as a skill, Slam goes up.  My barbarian warrior
twinkie is at 220+ Bash/Slam.

Infact, even though at level 55+ warrior kicks get a chance to stun,
Kick is capped at 210.  Bash is capped at 240.  Advantage:  Fatass.

Second best tank is usually the second best equipped warrior.
Followed by the third best equipped warrior, then fourth best equipped
warrior, etc...until you get to the 10th best equipped warrior.

Of course, if your fight is actually gotten to the point where you
have to depend on the 10th best equipped warrior to tank, it's time to
get a cleric out.

Actually, it's probably WAY PAST the time to get a cleric out...
