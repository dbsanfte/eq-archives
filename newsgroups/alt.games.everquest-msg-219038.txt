That's a sticky topic...  I'll just go ahead and put my neck in the
noose (again!) and share my (potentially extremely unpopular) opinion.

I know at least one (unmarried) woman who purposefully got pregnant
over and over again so that welfare would pay all her bills and she
wouldn't have to work.  Her plan actually worked.

Over the years, she's been in trouble (multiple) times due to neglect.
That is, she wasn't caring for her children properly.  She doesn't even
really care about them.  They were just a meal ticket.  At this point
she does the absolute minimum required to care for them.

I can't imagine what kind of messes these children we be as adults...

Is it appropriate for the government to mandate that I must hand my
wallet to this woman?  An obvious abuser of the system?  Yes, it's
not the fault of the children, but still...  I feel like there are
some fundamental problems.  The parents are handed the freedom to
take terrible risks...but I don't have the freedom to hold onto my
wallet and say, "No, I won't bail you out this time."  If I think
this incredibly non-politically correct thing, I'm branded as something
worse than slime for not 'saving the children'.

If a couple decides to have a child that statistcally has a 75% chance
of having serious problems and that society will have to shoulder the
burden of the costs of medical care, is that fair to society?  Why is
it some people get to roll the dice -- even if the odds are bad -- and
if they lose, it's not them that loses, but everyone else that loses?

: Even if you want to hold the 
: parents responsible, it does you no good, its certainly not the childs 
: fault, and punishing the child by depriving it of appropriate medical 
: support isn't going to solve anything.

I understand what you're saying.  Some would say altruism and love is
what sets humans apart from the rest of the animals on the planet.
That may be true.  And I'm sure if I were confronted with these
children one by one, my heart would break and I'd want to take them all
home with me.  And take care of all their hurts and pains.  My heart
isn't made of ice.

But the coldly logical part of me says: there is something wrong with
our system.  Does it make sense to spend $10,000,000 to save the life
of one child when there are *millions* of children who don't even get
the basics, like food, shelter, clean water, basic medical care, and
an education?  Would it really be so wrong for society to encourage
these people to decide against rolling the dice and adopting instead?

Sure, I'm never, ever going to tell a couple they aren't allowed to
have children.  But I will still judge some of them irresponsible,
even horribly so.  If their offspring truly have a 75% chance of
having terribly severe genetic problems, and they choose to roll the
dice anyway, knowing they can't afford the medical care and the burden
will be on the rest of society...what have they done, in effect?  It
could be argued it's pointless greed to have their own biological
child, and it has doomed *thousands* of other children to malnutrition
and worse.

: But that is the crux of the problem. You did suggest a solution, you 
: suggested that holding the parents responsible would be better than 
: letting them breed without consequence. Unfortunately that is so vague 
: it just might work; but it presupposes that we actually have a system 
: that could judge them "fairly" without politics, corruption, agendas, 
: etc... and we don't.
: 
: The solution society has selected is the least of all evils.... for now.

Having been part of the adoption system and being part of our medical
system, I'm privvy to some interesting details that may raise the
hairs on the back of your neck.  It's terribly more common than you
think for our society to save children with severe ailments, like
children who are mentally retarded to the point of having absolutely
no awareness of themselves or the world around them.  Almost to the
point of brain death.  Could *I* pull the plug?  No.  Would *I* want
to decide whose plugs get pulled?  Gods no.  Can I think of even one
person qualified to make that decision?  Ugh...no.  But...

These children generally qualify for government aid, which is
typically in-the-home health-care by registered nurses at 16+ hours
per day.  The children generally need expensive specialized
equipment, and lots of other medical care, and surgeries.  They often
live into their 30's.

The children and people certainly are alive in the biological sense,
but oh my god, the cost.  You just can't imagine the cost.  And this
happens in a world where *millions* of children can't even get food
and clean water.  Whose potential is completely lost due to the lack
of an education.

There are more parent 'carriers' of serious genetic defects than you
think, rolling the dice against terrible odds.  Are they irresponsible?
Gosh, I really think so.
