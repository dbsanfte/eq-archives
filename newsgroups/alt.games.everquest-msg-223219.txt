One of the things I like about bards is how calm I can remain in
overwhelming circumstances.  I think swarm kiting gives bards a real edge in
gang wars when others are freaking out.  I just love it when things get
hairy and the ae fear gets going, heh.  Not many other classes can
understand that we'll get to them all eventually, it doesn't really matter
how many are coming and going.  Plus it makes for some funny screen shots.
