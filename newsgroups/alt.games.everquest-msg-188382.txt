Subhuman
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

I am becalmed, lost to nothing
Warm weather and a holocaust

Left to die by two good friends
Abandoned me and put to sleep
Left to die by two good friends
Tears of god flow as I bleed

So ladies fish and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
See me in my blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea

Oyster boys are swimming for me now
Save me from the death like creature

Oyster boys are swimming now
Hear them chatter on the tide
We understand, we understand
But fear is read and so do I

So ladies fish and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
See me in my blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea

Oyster boys are swimming for me
Just one deal is what we made now

Forest keys and whirlwind cold
Green keys too and keys of gold
And even locks that don't explode
When the skies become a scroll

So ladies fish and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
See me in my blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea
