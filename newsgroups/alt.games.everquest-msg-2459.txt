Well they are pretty nifty and I surely don't want to thrash someone
else's deal, but that seems just a bit excessive for a weapon you won't
really use as a weapon.  Maybe if it was a fantastic weapon on top of
providing bandages, but with its stats I just switch it out when I need
another stack for binding and once it procs I put a real weapon back in
that slot.  I am terrible at gauging prices and much prefer to hunt
rather than buy, but I'd be hard pressed to go over 1k for it myself if
I was the shopping sort.

Oh, and thank for providing the name <G>.
