I agree, I have even on RARE occasion offered as much as 150pp for a port.
on avg though i will usually pay 20-50pp... I have had dealings with people
that blew me off when on a cr, but the ones who have ported me in past trips
will turn around and shoot me where i need to go and tell me it is on them
this time... I remember once i was short on cash and needed a ride. I had
8pp and someone was announcing they were porting "donations accepted but not
required". I hailed him. He invited meto the group, I gave him the 8pp. he
canceled the trade and disbanded me from the group. I asked him what the
deal was, he said he needed 30pp for the port then made the SAME
announcement again. I in turn shouted that if you didn't have 30pp don't
bother asking him... The other 2 people that were grouped with him shouted
they wanted their money back and would find someone else to give their money
too... =) I had a great deal of satisfaction that day...
