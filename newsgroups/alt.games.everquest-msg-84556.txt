I wonder if he's on the Raithe... my cleric could use some good gear.  A
shining star of light (has that quest been 86'ed?), and a tizmak tunic (why,

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
