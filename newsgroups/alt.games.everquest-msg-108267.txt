Something many people forget is that some things are more valuable for
porting than cash many times their value, so its good to keep a few
stacks of this stuff in the bank. As a 56 druid here are some things
that I'd port for in 5 seconds while if I was busy I might not port
for 500 plat:

1) 20 spiderling silks (leather padding)

2) 20 of any kind of leather padding making skin (low, medium or high
qual pelt (higher ones can be skinned)

3) high quality bear skin (to tailor backpack, my inventory is usually
too full to actually accept the tailored backpack instead)

4) 40-60 bone chips (various newb xp/faction quests)

After I thought that list up, I put it to the test. My alt dark elf
cleric was raising factions beating on orcs and got a couple high qual
bear skins from passing bears. I then auctioned that I wanted a port
to NK for 50 plat, no one responded. Then I auctioned that I was
trading a high quality bear skin for a port to nk, got the port in 2
seconds (aprox value of such a skin if SOLD to the tailor is only 20
-40 plat on most servers.) 

Another time I was in surefall glade trying to raise ranger/druid
surefall factions (yes, I am a crazy dark elf cleric) I auctioned
paying 50 plat for a wolf form near the exit by ran walker. No reply
came. I then auctioned paying 50 plat for it OR 60 bone chips. A druid
came and said I will, I proceeded to hand him the 50 plat and he said
"No, I'll take the 60 bone chips instead please ;) " I had previously
got about 250 bone chips just buying them out in qeynos while getting
snake skin, rat whiskers and bat fur off the vendors to raise Order of
the Three (qeynos int caster guild faction) to non kos (used the one
use halfing form mask for that, very useful :) and got me to amiable
now in dark elf form.. bahhaha .) So while getting finally total non
kos and in fact beloved in qeynos (guards of qeynos, paladins of
qeynos, clerics of qeynos CAN'T get higher while bloodsabres (the
naughty sewer people faction) CAN'T get lower), I got some stuff for
other player services to boot.  

Loads of druids are tailors or such and always want stuff. Druids also
always have twinks for the stuff druids can farm well but have no use
for themselves and the twinks need xp/faction often.
