<shrug>  I've *never* said it before, and I've been playing since
release.  I'm not the sort to expect a nerf in every patch.

I noticed it immediately after a patch.  I'm pretty sure it was two
patches ago, but not positive.  My 45 druid was in RM killing giants
(as he had been doing for some time before the patch) and I instantly
noticed.  Most particularly, the *much* higher incidence of Root
breaking instantly, but resists seemed higher as well.

And I was certainly not alone in noticing it.
