I went to the new casino in Shandling's Roost in Shadowhaven.Its downstairs.
Its frickin mobbed. Right click a waitress. Drop 101 pp for a token.  There
are like 3-4 gambler dudes. Read them carefully - one will reward stuff for
fighters, etc,  another for druids, shaman, clerics, etc.

Then simply hand the right guy your token and a message will come up saying
lady luck is not with you.
Alternatively, simply drop your 101 pp on the ground. It's faster and less
annoying.

The guys who did win got wheat bread and kabobs.  Woo Hoo and more tokens
(for more bread, kabobs or lady luck just robbed you).

Presumably, you can win a golden ticket, then redeem it upstairs for a
random spin on the wheel of stuff ranging rom ca ca to marvelous.  One guy
said he got a primal spear? <shrug>

I look forward to one of you filthy rich folks figuring out the odds of
winning, until then, .... I won't be seeing you around that casino any time
soon.
