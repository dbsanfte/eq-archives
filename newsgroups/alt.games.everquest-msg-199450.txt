Well said.  There's a flip side to that too, in the days before PoP
came out, when everybody and his uncle had a "port whore" and the
competition had driven the expected payment for ports to common
destinations (those available to WIZ/DRU by L34) down to 10pp, I
found that putting 30pp into the trade window before even grouping
almost always got me an immediate port to whereever I was going.

Now why should that annoy?  For the anti-"donations" folk, whom I
infer you to be one of, I would think that it would be considered
more "honest" to put it out upfront that your "donation" will be
inspected for "worthiness" prior to acceptance.
