Febuary 28th 2003

   Last night I ventured to Kerra Island in search of Kerra Island
beetle eye's as part of a quest I am doing in Neriak for my level 16
Necromancer.  Well first off I ran into some Cat people that the npc
told me where friendly.  Not the case this could have been messy but I
ran into a few people sitting there so we grouped up and it turned
into a good killing experience to gain some good xp.  My questions is
from what I could see of the island I did not see any Beetles perhaps
I did not go far enough.  Does anybody know if they are in a certain
area of Kerra Isle?  Also I don't suppose anybody knows anything about
the Dolls the cat's drop I can't sell them but I have quite a few of
them. 


Second Question.

     I only have 256megs of Ram Does anybody know of a good paging
file size to go along with this as in virtual memory?  things are a
little choppy but not to bad really the Plain of knowledge is choppy
from what I have seen but again not to bad nothing I can't live with.
I have a 16mb video card with a pentium 4 1.6ghrz  and about 25 gigs
of hard drive space free.  So any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in Advance
