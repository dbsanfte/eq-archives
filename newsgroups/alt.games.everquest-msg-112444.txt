Umm, no. Actually, I think that you are somewhat unique in your reaction to
such a  non-event. Obviously this concept seems to be somewhat beyond your
grasp so I will supply a fairly typical example.

Subject_A:    "hey dude, join my guild, we roxors k"

Subject_B:    "No thanks, I'm already guilded"

Subject_A:    "hey dude, just join k, we really really roxors"

Subject_B:    "Um - which part of "no" are you having problems with?"
/ignore Subject_A

See, having reasonable reactions isn't that difficult, I can even manage it
myself with a minimum of medication. Nowadays I can even go to ChineseYum
Cha for lunch without jumping up and beating the serving girl (you know the
one - the ugly one that always get's the chicken feet and tripe trolley)
about the head with a soggy trout for not listening the first time I told
her "no".

I don't even feel the need to throw up on her foot to stress the point
either, just a smile and a "no" suffices every time. The wonders of
medication eh? You should try some one day....
