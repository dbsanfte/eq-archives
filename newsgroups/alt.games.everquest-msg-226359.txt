The FACT that its possible to win it via a LOTTO is IRRELEVANT.

Its still tying... if SOE starts requiring you to exclusively use their 
new [for example] 'web hosting services' as requirement to play LoE they 
can't duck the lawsuit by having the local radio station give away a 
stack of LoE CDs... they can't say the web service isn't a requirement 
because you could win one from the radio station.
