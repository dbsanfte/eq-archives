No one has fanboys quite like Blizzard does. For crying out loud, the 
company used spyware on its customers and still they defended them lol. I'm 
sure that some of these guys would continue to defend the company even if 
they made TV cameras and rectal probes a standard part of installation.

Having said that, I agree that the company has a right to enforce its 
standards any way it wants to. I wouldn't have suspended anyone for using 
the term "pussy", but I wouldn't bitch about it if I got nabbed doing it 
either.
