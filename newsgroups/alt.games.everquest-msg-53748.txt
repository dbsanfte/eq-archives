*heh* Don't stress it.

The only pet class I've played is an enchanter, but
http://eq.castersrealm.com/ lists the 12th lvl Necro pet spell as having
the ability, with a caveat. The spell will summon a pet from 9th to 11th
level. The pet must be above level 10 to hit magic-only mobs, or,
obviously, be given a magic weapon. Befriend a mage and have them summon
you a supply of swords at the beginning of your day. Oh, and do definitely
give your pet a weapon. Morley is a moron with about as much EQ knowledge
as a dried turnip. It -does- increase the damage output of your pet, and
does -not- have -any- impact on the attack delay of your pet, which is at
a fixed rate of 30 no matter what you do. (barring haste spells of course)
