The possibility of a 12 year old is interesting.  Before, when EQ required a
credit card, Verant had kids covered by requiring the person buying the
account to take responsibility.  However, now they accept game cards.

Are there age restrictions on the sale of game cards?  I've seen them on the
shelves at retail stores, so unless something flags them at the cashier as
requiring an ID check, it seems that any kid can go in and get them.
