CHA has no affect on fear.
DEX has no effect on fizzle rate, last I knew, just your level and skill.
I'm sure someone else will correct me if I'm wrong.  And if you aren't
meleeing, of course, it's not important for procs either.

My enchanter is at 51 and I honestly can't tell much difference between a
CHA of 130 and 200 when it comes to mezzing and charming so I suspect
there's a certain point where you get diminished returns.  If you can get
your non-buffed CHA up to about 100 you should be fine if you group with an
enchanter or shaman, either of which can give you a CHA buff (enchanter at
level 20, shaman at 14).

My enchanter's base (naked) CHA is 85 and his INT is 133.  Non-buffed but no
longer naked CHA is at 135 (minimum) with INT 160 (minimum).  CHA items are
NOT difficult to find.  They're easier than STR.
