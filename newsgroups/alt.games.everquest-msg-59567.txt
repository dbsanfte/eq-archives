I assume the warrior is not a dark elf, troll, or ogre?  Those races
might want to stay out of Kaesora because of faction.

That's not a good reason to rule it out...some people just have really
bad luck in certain places and hate them, while others love them.
Check it out for yourself.

Depends on how busy it is.  You might be able to almost walk right to
the blues.

How about SolB?  Some of the kobolds will be yellow or low red for
you.  I don't know if a 31 druid and 28 warrior could take them or
not, though.

You can always bind in Arena yourself, and if the warrior dies and you
live, you can gate, SOW him, and both run back.  If you end up having
so many deaths that you are spending too much time traveling from
Arena to CT, then you'll know CT is not the place to fight.

You can also, while in that area, go over and try the spectre outside
the Fear cave.  It will be yellow or red, but only has about 1700 HP.
If you can't handle it now, you can go try it whenever one or both of
you ding...and when it gets doable, you can then start playing around
with the ones in the cave.

There's high blue to low red stuff for you in LGuk that is not on live
faction, but I don't know if it is feasible...didn't do much of either
Guk myself.

>I have no problems with outdoor dungeon-like places either (EG LoIO Sarnak

Give the bloodgil goblins in LoIO a try...they range up to level 39,
so will be way red to you, but they only have about 1600 HP, and
respawn fairly quickly.  Will be great XP if you can handle them.
