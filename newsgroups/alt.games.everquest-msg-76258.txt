As I play a Dwarven Rogue, I naturally drink A LOT!  My Alcohol Tolerance
(A.T.) is around 180 and I am seeing some great boost in STR, STM and ATK
when I "tip a few" while fighting.  At this high of A.T., I can chug 10
beverages in a row before I start to feel any negative affects in dex and
agi and I stopped swaggering about 50 points ago.

Has anyone ever done (or seen posted ) a definitive study on how much high
A.T. helps your stats and on how many swigs is about right for the most stat
increases?  I seldom see melee's working on A.T. and at first, just did it
for the RP fun.

I love to buy stacks of some of the new Luclin beverages sold in
Shadowhaven...
