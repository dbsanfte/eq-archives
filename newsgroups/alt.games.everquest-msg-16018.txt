this same thing happened last night in Blackburrow on tallon zek. theres
this low level warrior standing inside the zone line yelling
"20pp for some one find and drag my corpse out of the hole"
then
50pp for someone to just tell me where it is
then
200 pp give me a LOC dammit please
500pp someone help....please....
with about 5 mintues, before it rotted since he was a level 4, to spare a
druid with a chipped bone rod comes in finds it. he got 500pp and an etched
mace.

feet from where i was looking for it. dam my luck
