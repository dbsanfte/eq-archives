I recently did basically this, restarted on a new server, knowing nobody and 
armed only with half a decade worth of knowledge of the game.
It was really fun, and we stayed poor through the entire journey (no 
excessive farming), so most of the items we found as drops are still 
upgrades now at level 63.

I say "we" when I mean "I", that's the schizophrenia from multiboxing on the 
roleplay server =)

Of course I didn't purposefully turn down outside help when offered, I 
received many fine gifts and buffs from strangers and new friends, and was 
always looking for good deals for my pennies in the bazaar.

Honestly, I don't think anyone has the will to do the "no twink" the way you 
define it above in the long run. No buffs? No purchasing anything? How about 
disallowing members to enter PoK, the bazaar or any newer zone too?

oh, well, I ramble and digress =)
