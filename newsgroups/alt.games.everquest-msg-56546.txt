There is a bit of confusion here. What happened was back in the day
Kodiaks and some animals showed scowl to EVERYONE in a perm way like
giants. However, they were NOT scowl to druids and rangers in reality
(you could sit right by them etc, it said scowl but they were not.) 

Later they fixed that bug so they no longer were a perm con of scowl
to everyone but were in fact showing amiable now to druids and rangers
(which they always were, even when they showed scowl) and threaten to
everyone else (which they always were, even when they showed scowl)

So what you mistook for their like of you improving, was verant fixing
a very old bug which dates back to when EQ began. So yes, it is answer
A) Once again, only a few mobs were like that such as Kodiaks, I
believe even young kodiaks had the correct con.
