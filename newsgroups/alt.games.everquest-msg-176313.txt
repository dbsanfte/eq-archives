I have Plains of Power and so it's a hop, skip and a jump to the Plane
of Knowledge and the nice chap in the nearby shop gives me these
prices.

The Plague Rat Tail gives me 1 - 5 - 4 - 4 which is the best by miles
in this area.   

By the time that I had completed Level 4 in the N Qeynos newbie area I
had over 30 plat in the bank.  Now, that isn't too bad at all.
