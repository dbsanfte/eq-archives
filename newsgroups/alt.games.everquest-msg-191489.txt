Taking three months off a year, I'm freshened up again as usual.

There is a new expansion, LOY... thats how long I've been gone.  I said
Froglok warrior, after all, sure couldn't do that back in January.

Druid soloing to 65 is cake, look into charm kiting in PON and a bit later,
POS, I know its not quadding, but frankly its faster that quadding ever
was.  You just need to change styles.
