Right, so when you said "This is song of Siren's right?  Charm pet is fine, Target
another mod and have Pet attack is fine, but You must switch target back to Pet
otherwise you loose Pet and it starts whacking you." You were incorrect.  Leave
that song running without ever stopping it, and you can indeed switch targets to
some other mob, not switch back to pet, and still not lose pet or have it whack
you.

Bravura is a very different charm, and you'll probably scream at SOE for letting
you learn Sirens and then taking it away as you start fighting mobs which are
immune to it because of their level.  I wish that they hadn't put the level
restrictions in, would be much nicer to see Bravura as an alternative style of
charm, so I could make a choice.  In many cases the Bravura style is actually
better, even though it uses mana... but a mana free charm that you could leave up
and running instead of doing all the target swapping sure was better for swarming
purposes (it also would break shortly after you stopped it, so with a little
planning, invis wasn't necessary to swarm)

Yes, Sirens won't work with the lock on.  Sirens lasts 3 ticks like most other
songs.  Lets say you are slow and take a full tick to target second mob, tell pet
to attack, and then target third mob.  A tick to cast mez, switch back to first
mob, charm again it should refresh just as its about to wear off.  You can't "lock
on mez and keep it running" but you can go back and forth between the two, keeping
three mobs busy.

On the other hand, it might be safer to just switch from one target to the next
mezzing all three.  The "target" pet for your charmed mob may decide to stop
fighting your pet depending on what the other people in your party are doing.

56K modem isn't exactly light speed, I get 4 songs in a twist about 90% of the
time, but not while doing multiple targets, as you see reading over it we're only
talking 3 mezzes run continuously and the occaisional charm reapply (during which
things are beating on me or someone else in the group)  I've talked to bards who
say they can run 5 twists almost steadily.

I chant kite a good deal, and its very clear how well I'm doing; if I twist three
chants none of them ever wear off except for ones that got a "missed note".  With
a four twist, hitting it smoothly you get the same effect, but every time you see
a chant wear off without a matching "missed note" or resist beforehand, you know
you are going a little too slow.  Trying a 5 twist every single chant wears off
before I can get it back up.


By the way (as a side note), since the chants contain not only the DOT but also a
debuff to that resist, if you are seeing resists its important to pull down to the
smaller twist, this way when you are trying to restick a chant your target has
that resist lowered making it easy to restick.  If resists aren't a problem, its
better to use the longer twist, so you aren't cutting short any chant cycles and
wasting potential damage.
