One of my multiple deleted characters was a 27 ranger...

Rangers are outstanding damage dealers, especially at high levels with
proper AA spending. They sacrifice some defense for this. If they know
how to manage aggro right, that's not a real problem.

And, yes, I personally know to post-60 rangers, neither of whom think
their class is underpowered, and both their guilds agree with them.

I wasn't flaming anyone for fear-kiting there. I was flaming people
for pissing and moaning about the ability to do so being removed. The
pathing error is one reason for the change, but might not be the only
one. And I know the jail area's layout in PoJ is terrible for fear
kiting...
