This is a reply to the replies below this, didn't feel like making 4
different posts that say the exact same thing ;)
Ok, I can see your points.  Though it does still seem like they were just
trying to help, they probably should have asked to be sure he didn't need
any, and the attitude he had afterwards of "I know what's right because I'm
higher level" was definitely stupid.  I can't believe that he actually would
have used /ignore too, lol.  I couldn't really say how difficult it is to
build skills because I've never (exclusively) done it on a low level
character.  So, in conclusion, they should have asked before 'assisting',
but I don't think you can blame them for trying to be helpful.  It doesn't
appear they had the intent of pissing you off.
