Only person I agree with here is Sofa, I am surprised by all the different
answers, lol

As an ogre you're strength is fine. Make sure your agility and dex are 75
(under this and you'll get penalties)
Agility does very little to AC and absolutely nothing to movement speed
(only slows you down when it drops below 75) If agility was any use to a
warrior then we'd all be wearing Serp bracers.
Dex does NOT effect the amount you hit in combat (unless it's a ranged
attack) yes, it does state otherwise in some guides.
Stamina will have little effect to you health to start with BUT a huge
effect to it later on.

I'd recommend making sure all physical stats are 75 (as has been said by
others) then concentrate mainly on Stamina. I know you'll put points into
strength anyway, who could resist making a strong race stronger when playing
a fighting class :�)
The effect of strength on damage isn't really that much (prolly less than
agility has on AC) and many items you'll get will give you strength anyway,
so as a large race I wouldn't lose any strength over it.

Sod it, spread them about as you wish, this is meant to be a roleplaying
game so if you want to play an Ogre with the agility of Yuen Biao (although
given the size maybe Sammo Hung would be a better choice of comparison :�))
then do so. If high strength and stamina was essential then smaller races
like Dark and Wood Elves, would not cut it as warriors and if Agility was so
great to warriors, everyone would play Dark and Wood elf warriors.

If you want to number crunch then;

STA
STR
AGIL
DEX

CF
