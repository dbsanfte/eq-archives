I don't doubt for a moment that there are people who qualify as poor by 
US government standards that play eq.  Personally, I don't have a hard 
and fast rule for defining who is poor and who is not.  There are far too 
many factors involved in it.  I am quite certain however that the ability 
to purchase a BMW or Ferrari is not one of the factors I would generally 
use.

BTW, sorry to sidetrack your humor here with a more serious post.
