Well I can't really help you with specific quests.

You could always make up your own quests. When I still played my bard
I wanted to carry a pair of Wakasashis/Katanas, and have a set of
bamboo splint armor (for RP reasons). I then went out and hunted
Kobolds in Stonebrunt until I got the drops I wanted. It's fun and
easy. You just need to come up with an idea/goal and go for it. Once
you accomplish it set a new one.
