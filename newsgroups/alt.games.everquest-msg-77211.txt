And of course, as soon as I wrote the above, my machine had a "serious
failure" and rebooted *itself* while I was ingame. It toosed me out to the
dreaded COMPAQ screen. God only knows what happened, but I was a good
litttle girl and sent the message off to Microsh*t. And I noticed that I did
get a vm message after that, as well... which I rebooted to. It was fine
after that. sigh. I wish I knew more about the inner workings of these
things.
