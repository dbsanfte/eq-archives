Another idea is a cleric to atone, you don't have to camp at all then.
I did something like this today with my dark elf of inny. I had the
nitrates quest thing from surefall and wanted to give it to Linya
Sowlin in WK but she was dubious. So I asked in ooc if a ranger or
druid would come and camo me after I handed it to her before I hit
accept. One said he would but he was at the farmer bandit camp.. so I
punched her once and had her follow me across the whole of WK almost
to that bandit camp, rooted her, atoned (she was dubious again so I
knew it worked) Handed thing to her and then he camo'ed me. I found
out that indiff was still not high enough with her and got dissed =/ I
guess I need wolf form to make it amiable or something.

at 39 I've been going nuts with atone lately for stuff.. its darn fun.
I'm still kos to karana residents and the blue con ogre tiny miller
was after me, root, atone atone, I back up and root breaks and he
stands there for a minute then walks off the other way (these old
world mobs don't "forget" you either the same way as the kunark plus
ones do when you outdistance them, so atone is especially useful)
