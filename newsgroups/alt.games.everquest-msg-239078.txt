Was it the 2 that confused you?

What about someone who doesn't understand how a weapon ratio works and how
to compare weapons with vastly different damages and delays?

I see, this is the "thrashing" that Sean referred to in his response to your
bungled "ad-hominem" accusation.

Apparently the point is that if he had investigated, he would have
discovered that there were other items that were probably a little bit
better that were selling for less in the bazaar and thus shouldn't have
conclusively figured that they'd be nerfed.

And you completely missed the point of my message, which doesn't surprise
me.  You really don't know what an ad-hominem is, do you, Mr. Tyger.

BTW, why the "y" substituted for an "i" in Tiger?  It makes the word sound
more feminine, which in turn makes you sound more effeminate.  You're a
swish, aren't you?  You couldn't even lift a pad of paper with those limp
wrists of yours, could you?  It's obvious to me now: you mention your wife
so much because of your dubious sexual idenitity, and hope that no one
figures out that she's your beard.  But I'm on to you, Mr. Tyger, and soon
everyone else will know it.

See, that's an ad-hominem.  You may think me clueless, but I know what that
is.
