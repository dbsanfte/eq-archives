So each of them said, when called on it.

That didn't stop 5 mobs in Miragul, and 4 more in Tak (yet another fucking
stupid paladin) from taking off at half health and having to be chased for 2
rooms before they were finally stunned / rooted and able to be meleed again.
One caused 3 adds and a near wipe.  Thank you mister stupid fucking
know-it-all paladin! Thank you!  (1)

It's asking for trouble, and distinctly unncessary, considering the stun
arsenal a paladin has.

the shaman's pet outdamaged you in two battles.
