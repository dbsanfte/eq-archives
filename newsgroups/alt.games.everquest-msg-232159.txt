Oh no doubt.

But since I reinserted the three lines you snipped out in your first
response to me, everybody can see that all of this is simply bullshit.

But keep trying to insult your way to a "win".  Surely you've learned that I
don't back down because somebody starts tossing insults because they've got
nothing better to contribute.  :P

Talk about poor intelligence.  The post you were replying to was as wildly
"wrong" (or irrelevant, your choice) as yours, thus why I mentioned both in
my first post to this thread.

All I did was point out that you were informing a level 23 ranger he should
be using 2h, following someone who thought a level 23 ranger should be using
a bow.  Not really much to fuck up there.

You would definitely qualify as inane.  In fact, that was pretty much your
argument in your last response wasn't it?  "I'm not wrong, I'm just inane."
