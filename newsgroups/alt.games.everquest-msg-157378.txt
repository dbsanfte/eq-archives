Well, I only scanned thru the first couple fights, mostly to verify the
impression I'd been left with in-game.  I have all my boring melee spam
in its own chat window, so I mostly only see spell and proc spam in the
chat window i'm keeping an eye on (may have to vector that crap off too,
but the "is stunned" messages are often useful), and she would stack up
8 to 10 "...Hand of the Gods!" messages for every "is stunned" when my
SotM would proc.

Lance's last posted log had no pet, a significant amout of swinging at
air (he was fear kiting and so lost contact at every recast of Yaulp V),
and he was fighting a yellow con (L61 or L62) mob.  Even so, according
to K64's post he did nearly 18 DPS over the first third or so of the
log (I looked up the original on google and the 41 melee hits K64's
parse showed were approx. the first third of it).  That's 18 DPS vs.
yellow con (not lo blue like the test I was referring to) mob without
using UHOF or the "Mark of Xx" spell that does damage (also part of
the first posted log I referred to).

Anyhow, I'll parse some more stuff to check, but I've pretty much burned
out on bitching about it anyway.  Now that the initial shock has finally
worn off all that's left is the occasional snide comment, heh.  And in
the one group where I saw a big effect from a BattleCleric I was holding
my own just fine as far as contributing to the group, the only time we
came close to a wipe was the one fight where I couldn't stick a stun on
an Enchanter to save my life, and our Wizard siezed that opportunity to
demonstrate that sometimes it's all about burst damage (half the group
was mezzed, including our Enchanter)... the rest of the night I pretty
much kept every caster I saw stunned while adding in a little damage as
a bonus (not much compared to the 56 Rogue and 59 Warrior).
