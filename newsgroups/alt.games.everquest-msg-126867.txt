Steamfont newbie area doesn't exist or was moved.  Last night I successfully
found and killed 3 level 1 skels for a total loot of 2 bone chips and zero
cash.

Looks like my li'l enchanter won't be able to afford to buy even one tiny
dagger (let alone the spell!) until level 2 where I saw an occasional yellow
con in the newbie zone, populated with aggro cats and dogs red to me at 1.
Re-memming 2 spells every 5 minutes with no meditation gets old quickly.

I started with a Vah Shir bard, but then realized we're talking Luclin and
FPS of less than 10 on my 700MHz machine. :p

I'll probably make a halfling druid and pray they didn't change Misty so
there's nothing to kill there either.
