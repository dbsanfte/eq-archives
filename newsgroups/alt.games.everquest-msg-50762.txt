 Just because you use more than 8 doesn't mean you need to mem more than
8.

 Form of the Howler lasts a very long time. That can be swapped out with
SoW. 

Skin Like Nature can be cast, unmemmed and Resist magic can be swapped
in.

Ring can be swapped out with gate until needed. 

Leviate can also be in the 'buff spot' where SLN and RM are.

So, here's what we have:

>1)Form of the howler. (sow and mana regen)
>6)Sow 

>2)Skin like nature (hp+ac+regen)
>3)Resist magic (I hate root)
>11)Levitate. Darn named mobs always seem to spawn on the top of mountains.

>10)Engulfing roots (We need this for our dots)

>12)Scoraie

8 slots taken. Happy to help. Next!
