Was just looking thru the EQ FAQ glossary... very nice!  One thing I
noticed was the definition of Ping referred to gaining an AA, which I
hadn't heard before.  Another defn (which I don't recall if I've heard
in EQ) is that people refer to your network latency as "ping", e.g.
"my ping is 200ms" or "omg my ping is 1500".  Not sure if this is an
EQ term or not, I don't recall if EQ actually displays the ping times.
