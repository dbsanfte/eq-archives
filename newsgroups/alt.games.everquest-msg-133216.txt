The absolute best tradeskill you can take up to benefit your cleric both
long and short term is none.  That's right, if there is anything you want
that is made by a tradeskill, go out and kill things loot them, sell the
stuff, save your pennies, and buy it.  You will end up with better
equipment, and more money.  Now, when it comes to the shawl quests, you have
to be seriously committed to get beyond the fourth shawl.  The fifth one is
the first one that requires tailoring.  Tailoring is evil.  The good news is
that by starting now, you might have your tailoring at a high enough level
by the time you are at a level to hunt the mobs your will need to hunt to
get the drops for your fifth shawl.  All that being said, I have taken up
Smithing with two characters, and Brewing, Baking, Alchemy, Fletching, and
Tailoring with one character.  What can I say, I'm a masochist.
