I agree, at some point in time this was bound to happen.  Just like it will
happen to Win98 and other operating systems in the future.  They have to
improve the game at times or they will never attract new customers and will
have to shut it down.  Progress is a good thing.  It's ultimately the
customers choice to play or not.  Let the market decide their fate.  I for
one have a low end system (pII 450 with a crappy video card).  I can't play
any of the new games coming out(at a decent level of enjoyment anyways).
Its progress and it will always be this way hopefully.  I just figure all
those good games I'm missing out on now will be in the bargain bins in about
a year from now when I save up enough for a new computer.
