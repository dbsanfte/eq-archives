Could not agree more, the person running the site spends a LOT of time
compiling it. Time that could be used making money in the real world, but
its used to make our EQ experience better.

But I would also agree they should say what donations are going to be used
for, ie
All donations will be used to pay for the bandwidth and hosting of this site
and anything left over will be put into bla bla etc.
