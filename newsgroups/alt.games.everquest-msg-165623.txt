That is just gross.  On Povar, one of the more powerful guilds is ruining
its own reputation by slimy actions, but this one certainly is far above and
beyond.



First, let me recommend to your friend that he do more research before he
joins a guild.  Tell him to group with people as much as possible and to
talk to as many members as he can locate.  For every "premature wannabe uber
even though it's almost theoretically impossible" there is a guild out there
that is based on some pretty decent values, just have to find them.  Might
take some time, but is worth it in the long run.
