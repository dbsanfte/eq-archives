Crap :) You always have the occasional lazy bumms that are in West Freeport
begging for a SoW for at least 15 minutes for a corpse run to Oasis..... I
had one the other day.... the poor bastard finally started running at a time
he could have been to Oasis, picked up his corpse and get a SoW in Oasis at
the docks as there are always high level people waiting for the rafts.

But yeah.... I'm bound in PoK and it is worth the 29 bucks I paid for it
even though I am a lvl 19! PoK rules big time. I have really begun to love
those books.....
