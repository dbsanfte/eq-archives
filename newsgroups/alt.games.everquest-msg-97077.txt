Sorry, that rule does not support your assertion that
there is a rule prohibiting "Name/surname combine to form a single
word".  Please try again.

Then he needs to get new glasses.

"Xtermin Ator" is clearly a play on "Exterminator", a
perfectly good (and allowed-by-the-rules) name for a
monk or rogue who sees his role as wiping out the
vermin which infest norrath.

Later you try switching to:

Sorry, strike three:  Unlike toasters, phasers, etc, they
had exterminators back in the "place and time setting of
the game" -- what was the Pied Piper but an exterminator?

The English word "exterminate" itself in its present form
dates back to 1535, and is based on the almost identical 
Latin word "exterminatus" which means that the word 
has been in use for at least two thousand years (unlike "phaser").

How old is the "time setting of the game"?  Well,
considering that the rise of full suits of plate
armor occurred around 1350 AD...
