  I think trolls make good (maybe the best) shamans, for two main reasons:
regen and the fact that unlike Iksar, they can use the jaundiced bone bracer
(a high level bracer that you can right-click to fire off a nice nuke for no
mana).  Regen is a good bonus because of the Cannibalize line of spells you
get that allows you to convert health to mana.  Shamans are a great class
though, if you like the spell list you should be happy whatever race you
choose.

   As for stat placement, wisdom is your mana stat and trolls aren't very
wise, so you should some points in there... probably as many as it will
allow you to.  Where you put the rest is up to you... there are probably
convincing arguments to putting them in just about any stat.  Maybe agility
or stamina to slightly increase your survivability... maybe intelligence or
charisma for trade skills.  Dexterity... I've heard that dexterity can help
you in channeling spells, but I've also heard other people shoot that one
down.

  It's up to you.  :) Good luck.
