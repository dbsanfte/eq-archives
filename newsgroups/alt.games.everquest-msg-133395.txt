Nah...Trak is harder than _some_ of the VP mobs.  I've seen some
guilds follow bigger guilds in just to mess around with the non-named
and "yard trash" mobs there...kind of like a no-risk practice run with
a bigger, better-equipped guild there to CR and rez them.

Emporer is MUCH tougher than the "yard trash" in VT.  And a lot
of the loot that is worthwhile to get drops off of 1-2 group mobs.
Not all, and not the best, but it's sort of like some of the quirky
stuff from Greig's...useful to have in a Tink bag for emergeny/
fun/duels/serious CR gear/etc.
