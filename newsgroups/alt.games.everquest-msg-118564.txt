Hello:

I'm Gnome, I used to use Felwithe bank a *lot* but sadly, after going on a
raid to PoG I've ruined my faction. I've managed to get my Jagged Pine
faction back, I've also managed to get the guards in Felwithe allied,
however, the high-elf residents of Felwithe are KoS .. How can I right this?
.. I've slaughtered Crushbone time after time after time .. I must have kill
many hundreds of Orcs .. I'm trying to get the Dwarf in the Inn in Freeport
off of KoS so I can do the muffin quest, I can't seem to raise my faction
with him  .. apparently this quest fixes high-elf faction.

Thank you all, and safe hunting ..

Stevie.
