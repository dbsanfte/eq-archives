My guess is doing the start of the mage epic quest with        in lake
Rathe.

This was stolen from the message board at www.eqdruids.com

1. Go to Lake Rathe and find the gnome wizzard Rykas, sorry dont know
the location, just track him. 
2. Bind yourself on his island. 
3. Hail him and do the yada yada with him till he gives you a coin.
    Try saying "I wish to learn" 
4. Port to the Commons and head toward the kithacor zone and track
down Jhason (spelling??) a human wizzard who wanders back and forth
along the zone wall, and give him the coin. 
5. Port back to Rykas and do it all over again

I burned thru lvl 24 to 25 this way. boring as hell but shoot I got a
yellow for every 9 coins.

I also hear rummors that this quest is going to be nerfed if it hasent
already
