With the intro of the Legends service, the sub rate increase and the
offer of full year subs at the old rate makes me wonder what Verant's
up to. Are they trying to make themselves look more profitable for an
interested buyer, Are they proping up the stock price, are they
needing more money for a future game release because someone pulled
some of its financial support for game development????
