Hi Chris

I had this problem for a while. If I let it continue then even the main 
music would get seriously distorted. Rivervale sounding if the entire 
band was completely inebriated or playing backwards?

It would usually start at either 4 to 5 hours play or after approx. 30 
zonings, which ever came sooner.

While I haven't cured it completely. I have delayed it's onset to 
approx. 9 to 10 hours play and I haven't bothered counting zonings.

I think it's partly to do with the soundfont library that EQ loads into 
the sound card. They are approx. 18.5Mb in size in total. As well as all 
the data the EQ shifts through the northbridge chip.

I was using the dynamic cache setting on my old SBlive card and it 
usually started with 4Mb spare space. So EQ was shifting it's soundfonts 
in and out as well as the music. This was putting a further load onto 
the old northbridge chip especially during zoning.

By setting the cache to 20Mb and preloading all the EQ Soundfonts. I cut 
the northbridge use a bit.

It also had the subjective effect of cutting zoning times as well, 
especially between old world and PoK.

So overall in my case I have a feeling it's an overheating northbridge 
chip eventually causing data corruption.
Yours
