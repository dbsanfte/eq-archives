My wis literally hovers at 200, I try to keep an upgrade path that nets
no wis loss, since 199 wis is a lot more mana lost from 200 than 200 is
from 201.  AC/Saves/HP are important things to keep in mind, though,
if I can pick up a little wis elsewhere then killing one of the old velium
jaspers I've had since my 20s would be fine

I wish I had clear information on this.  When doing raids, I probably ought
to ditch out on AC entirely and get all the HP gear I can muster, for
Mod Rod mana production.  On the other hand, in groups I tend to
get knocked around a lot, since I'm quite cavalier about taking some hits.
Will 9 AC (worn more like 16 AC) really not amount to more than 40
hp worth of damage saved?  I have my doubts.

DO tell, what for?  I"m a big fan of clicky stuff, and have found that
clicky versions of spell I'd never cast for mana are quite useful in
surprising ways; Valor, Word of Healing, Tremor.. joke spells if
I have to spend mana, but very effective for free.  So what do you
use Root for when its free?

OK, sounds like Underfoot is the high end of the dwarven cultural smithed
gear, thats what I'll look for.
