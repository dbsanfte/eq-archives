This is incorrect.  Even as far back as the first expansion, Kunark, its been
possible to scribe spells from the expansion without buying it... and there
was a thriving trade in running over, filling a backpack with Breeze scrolls,
and selling them in EC, as this was the one expansion spell every chanter
between 16 and 29 wanted.

Likewise the velious vendor buyables were happily purchased at the
igloos and distributed among guildmates all over Norrath, distribution
problems with SOV were so bad that even people who had ordered
the expansion were without access for up to a couple weeks.  You can
be sure that any young guilded cleric had Armor of Protection, though,
another of the "best buyable spell in the expansion" contenders.

Celestial Healing drops only in Velious, and quite infrequently.  I've
seen it drop only off Guardian Wurms in Great Divide, but it may
well drop other places as well.  Its not "no drop" so anyone who
finds a copy can sell it or give it away, normally the latter... anyone
who isn't friends with at least a few clerics or guilded with several
and is all come over with greed  might try and sell it... I think going
price is 500 to 1000pp.  It is a -strong- contender for best drop spell
in the SOV expansion, and a clerical "must have" 44 to 54.

Given the rarity in which "got this drop spell and don't know a young
cleric who doesn't have it yet" happens, your best bet would be
to get some guildmates who have the expansion to go there and
get it for you... decent exp, plenty of other spell drops and ok
loot otherwise.  Be prepared to take some ribbing about not
owning  SOV though, as you level up you'll find a lot of the best
hunting, best exp, and best loots are out there in the cold.
