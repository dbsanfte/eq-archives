What the guards will or will not attack follows little pattern. I think it
works that if the mob is of a race that is friendly to the guards they will
leave it alone, whether or not that mob is friendly doesn't matter.
I was told that it was if they were intelligent life they wouldn't attack
but that doesn't work for Gnolls too well...or Orcs.
Anything human will be left unharmed to beat the crap out of you...I guess
as the arborians are sort of Treeants it follows the same sort of logic with
Elves.
