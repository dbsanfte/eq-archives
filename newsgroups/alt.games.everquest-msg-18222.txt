Given that everyone, unless they started the game as RL friends of
Uberlevels who immediately started their first character in planar gear,
had to go through the bug bashing in leather stage at least once, that
statement makes zero sense. We've all already been there, done that, got
the tunic. There's no basis for insecurity, unless you, yourself, have
some RL issues carrying over into the game.

Well, then if you've accepted the game we are all playing, problem
solved!

Soooooooooo......... your reason for the cheap shots about insecurity

*GASP*! Sorry........ laughing/coughing fit.
(ahem)
Several points of inconsistency to be addressed here. First of all, if
you've really been playing that long, you know VERY well that the class
differences for grouping purposes don't even *begin* to diverge until
the teens, and don't get hugely amplified until the late 20's. Everyone
can do almost everything in the first ten levels. You really start
learning your character as the levels advance and you have to get into
groups and fit into your unique roll. Spending an extra three nights
slugging through (and dying repeatedly) to decaying skeletons isn't
teaching you squat about your character after the first time you've done
it.
  Second, your comment about twinking warriors with Jade Mace instead of
a "lowly langesax"......... HA! I twinked my warrior to the best of my
pathetic ability and got bronze weapons. I saved up for Langesax, and
got it early. Not that much different. So apparently you think there's
"good" and "bad" *levels* of twinking? Either you do it on your own or
you don't. Case closed. I would have killed for some Langesax when I was
still in my single digit levels, and I still consider mysefl a minor
twink. But I've been through those levels with seven characters now. I
don't need to do it again. It's enough to learn all the spells, weapons,
items, etc. and their individual effects in combat, and all the things
that can go wrong/right in group situations without having to worry
about the second spiderling ganking you.
  As I said......(and I'm still only speaking from the perspective of a
relative "lowbie" or "midbie" just shy of 40)  been there, done that,
got the tunic. I've played a bunch of both melee and caster types to at
least twenty. I don't need to do level one through seven again getting
killed by orc pawns to learn something new, thanks. Whatever minor
lessons they will teach I'll pick up quickly enough as the game gets
more complicated.
