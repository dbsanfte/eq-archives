I would be doing champagne magnums from 191-196 personally (and will be
next week when I finally get around to nailing 200).

Cost is under 30pp per attempt.  (This presumes you have an outlet for the
completed magnums, but I've always begged jewelers to make them for me and
paid 1k/stack, so the demand probably exists.)
