    Let me just interject one dissenting opinion here. This zone can be done
by folks in PoF/PoH gear, with some Kunark armour. That's who originally did
the zone when it came out, after all. For a cleric that has access to that
level of gear....

    Is OK, and might be worn if they're WIS-capped.

    Beats all the alternatives. Even today, you won't see better unless you
have Velious-quest armour, or Crystal Chitin Gloves/Coldain Skin Gloves
(which aren't cheap).

    Is better than Donal's and Ethereal Mist.

    This is actually a pretty nice rogue weapon pre-epic. Even post-epic
it's good offhand, although with Centi stuff it isn't as slick as it was
during Kunark.
