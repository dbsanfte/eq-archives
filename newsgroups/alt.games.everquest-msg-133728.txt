I did die once too trying this with the Ogre spawned, so I know
what a pain it is.

I was working on how to do this part of the quest.  I was standing there trying
to figure out a strategy that might work.  Then someone came along and killed
both the Great Oowomp and his ogre friend.

Great.... now what... well I sat there for a while and the Great Oowomp spawned
first!  I raced up to him, handed him the coins, skelly pops, said the right phrase,
and bingo!  the bag.

This wasn't more than a couple of weeks ago, so I don't think the quest is broken,
but you do have to use the right words with the skelly and be close enough to him
for him to hear it.

Someone else suggested continuous feigning.  Run up behind, feign, stand up and
hand the coins, feign, stand up and say your phrase to the skelly, feign, stand up
and run to the dock, feign.
You should have the phrase ready on a hot key, or at least be ready to hit the Enter
button after typing your phrase while feigned.  Oh, and your feign skill should be
maxed out before attempting this.  Make sure you feign after spells have been cast,
otherwise, they won't believe your feign if their spell lands.


By the way, when you're ready to head back home, the easiest path is via the
"fire pot room" in Timorous Deep.  There's a vase there that will take you right
back to Cabilis.

I still haven't completed this "epic" quest, because I need the hand from the Sarnak
courier.  It's an easy kill for a level 25, but I think the spawn time must be huge.  I've spent
at least 3 hours hunting in the area where he spawns (and in the process getting Pk'd several
times) and haven't seen him spawn.  Do you have the Sarnak Courier's hand?  If so,
any tips?
