And they have since been found to be bottomposting groups.

You were called a liar because you LIED, Andrew. You ARE a liar.

All the usenet FAQs indicate bottomposting as the preferred method.
That is proof enough.

Stop lying and I'll stop calling you a liar.

Does the truth hurt you in some way, Andrew?

They mean I am forceful and verbally vicious which will surprise no
one. Did you just learn these words today, Andrew?

The people there had a fascinating way of dealing with september
eleventh. It's a very refreshing newsgroup, no little babies there who
cry when they are caught lying. If you were going to stalk me,
however, and came across that group, you should have gone for the only
redeeming point you could have with it - it is one of the few groups
with any significant degree of top posting... though it still has a
majority bottomposting.

I dub thee a liar. This is, what, three times now you've been caught?
