New mad scheme, flush my alchemy successes, I decided to make a Jeweler 
alt.   I had a 30 enchanter from a few years back just lying around 
gathering dust, so I blew the cobwebs off, went out and leveled up to 32 
for Enchant Platinum, then went to work.

CR Jeweler quest to 54 was free, then I did the Trophy quest, which ran 
a couple hundred plat in parts.  From there, I foolishly looked at cost 
to make stuff and decided to do the various Cuts of gems and ladder up. 
   Things like Round Cut Bloodstone are dirt cheap, and fast and easy to 
do, buying only one ingrediant.   You can't sell the product back to teh 
vendors, but its just not all that expensive at first.

Well this lasted a while, but eventually the gems started to cost "real 
money" and I started looking for an alternative.   Gold Bloodstone (or 
something along those lines) actually cost less than the gem I was 
cutting at that point, as the new gem was one of the cheapest, and gold 
was less costly than the gem I was currently using.  To my astonishment, 
though, it turns out you can sell back that old school stuff for nearly 
cost... the only real expense comes with fails!

Well I laddered back up and reached into the 200's with a total spent of 
around 2Kpp, and a lot of that because I wasted time on the wrong sort 
of combine.

One product I had to make while doing the "round cut" sort of combine, 
though, was a Jeweler's Glass.   Parts trivialling at 50, and my skill 
around 75, this was annoyingly hard to do, but cheap enough that my 20 
or so fails wasn't a real expense.

Finally comfortable with my skill level, I went ahead and did the work I 
decided to do this for: two sets of Platinum Trio jewelry, along with gems.

For the monk, 8 pieces, all with Fire Emerald, Opal, and Peridot: DS, 
HP, AC.

For the Shaman, only 7 pieces, as I wanted to keep one bracelet for the 
BA III focus.   I did two FT, two HP Regen, and 3 DS.  With the gear I'm 
currently wearing, this puts me very close to cap on FT, and a nice 
healthy amount of HP regen and 8 DS... but the Monk is nearly at DS cap, 
which along with a skinspike VI potion makes for some very hefty DS indeed.

Then I made the Enchanter a DS set just like the monk's, grabbed 
Skinspikes from the bank, and set out to play.   With Feedback, which is 
a castable 15 point DS that stacks with both, I was at 69 DS at 32, as I 
leveled up this jumped to 70 something and then to 81... and I found I 
could remove one of the pieces of jewelry and stay at cap; each piece is 
5DS at the Reccomended level, so I guess the worn cap is 35

Sadly, on getting the Fire Elemental illusion, I discovered that it 
doesn't stack with Potion DS, and the potion is much bigger.   Useful 
for clearing out trash when I really don't want to spend the money, but 
nothing I'd really rely on, at least at low levels, I guess the DS gets 
bigger as you level up.

I'm now leveling the enchanter up to 44 so I can enchant Velium, which 
will mean even more effect from each piece, allowing me to max worn DS 
and still have room left over for Defiant bracers, or for other jewelry 
items like the FT and HP regen, or maybe the crazy HP/AC/Stat gems.

Also attractive are Compartmented, these items add a type 7 augment 
slot, at the cost of raising the Rec level by 5.   I made a couple, and 
they do lower the effect significantly at level 32...but in the high 30s 
they don't do much worse than the straight items.   At this point this 
doesn't matter as I'm not swimming in augments, but once I can wear DON 
ones I can pick up RC's and go to town, the compartmented will be well 
worth it.
