You never watched me play Freecell (it took EQ and the fact that
excessive mouse usage is prone to jamb the nerves to my right hand
pinky for months on end to break *that* habit)... my Freecell tactics
are possibly the only thing crazier than my Risk tactics - and they
work better, too :) (Risk tactics usually have me go 'suicidal' and
either crush everyone or go down in a blaze of glory)
