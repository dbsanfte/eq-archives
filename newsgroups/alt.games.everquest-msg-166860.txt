IMO, the hardest class to play is one you cannot stand, or simply cannot 
get the hang of. For everyone, the answer is different.

I'm miserable playing a straight mellee for long periods, and like to 
solo sometimes. I think I'd detest being a rogue most.

And while I've played shaman to 26, and cleric to 55, I just can't get 
my brain around a druid.

Also, I'm not sure about wizzies or enchanters. So I think those 4 
classes would be hardest.

I'm also quite sure others would find them cake.

As for which combination has the roughest time? I think a gnome cleric 
to Bertoxx. You are pretty much born KOS to the cleric guild in AkAnon, 
and there is no place you can buy your spells, except maybe in the 
Qeynos aqueducts.
