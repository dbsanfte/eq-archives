Hi Mike;

This EXACT same thing has started happening to me too.  It started just
BEFORE the last big patch. I too have to camp to clear it up.  It happened
once in an LDoN and a dozen times in the ST camp in BoT (several times in
one night). But what's odd is it has not happened anywhere else. I sure hope
someone has an answer to this too.
