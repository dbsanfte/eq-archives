Another way is to move both character to the same location, a very quiet
private location to be sure.  Drop gear during campout, log other character
in fast and pick it up.  Risky due to LD chance, or a wandering PC finding
it.

Never try this in Qeynos though.  The rats zero in on dropped items and
destroy it fast.

Best place I have found is 3rd floor of Jade Tiger inn, or North wall of
East Commons.  High up is a flat place along zone line.

Very few people go up there.  Also a good place to practice safefall for
monks.
