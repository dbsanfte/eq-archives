I totally agree on the Froglok Monk idea.  Looking at their stats, they
don't seem that ready to be any of the five classes without some good
equipment.  Way too low on Wisdom/Intelligence to be a caster, and there
strength is lacking for the fighters.  With Dex/Agi so dang high, ranger,
bard, monk, and maybe rogue would be the better classes.  Of course maybe
I'm totally wrong and my ideas on stats are off, but at first glance that's
what I thought.

A few friends of mine were tossing around the idea of a new class for the
Frogloks (which will never happen, but would be interesting).  How about a
Jester.  Would be a hybrid between either Enchanter/Warrior or
Enchanter/Rogue.  Haven't worked out the mechanics on it all, was just a
fleeting idea, but thought I'd throw it out in here.  :)
