Is this a bug anyone else has encountered?

It is sort of a bug, sort of a feature.  You died while you were zoning, but
everquest cant let this happen as your body would be stuck in between zones.
So instead they give you a second chance.  They put you at a safe spot
(wether it be your bind point, or near a zone line) and put your HP at what
it was before you zone.

I've evaced out of Karnors before to sro, and ended up at the Oasis zone
line on 81hp, a long way away from the wizzy pad :)

Take it as a blessing ;) Also sometimes all your buffs are gone after you
finished loading, but you dont lose xp or equipment.
