From what I'm told the points has absolutely nothing to do with the
actualities of the server. It's dominated (apparently) by green
gankers and has little bearing otherwise.

When I see stories of good not even having enough 50+ to do a plane
raid during the evening sometimes - I mean serverwide, not just a
guild - compared to evil which has a number of guilds quite capable of
doing so alone, I get worried.
