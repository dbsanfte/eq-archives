Except for bards and enchanters...

More than once my little 19 bard sat and watched the RyGorr Avengers
tear thru several parties in their 40s and 50s at the orc fort, all the while
chatting up the blacksmith and oracle.  Too bad they seem to have no
quests at all.  Perhaps if I chat with Scarbrow?

Might have to level up a bard to carrilion level again, just to try it.
