You're talking about the absolute end-game, right?  I mean THE uberist of
uber critters?

You've pretty much nailed it.  Just those 2 classes.  Of course, the
likelihood of you being able to get enough warriors and clerics is damned
near nil, so toss in the other tanks (ranger isn't a tank).  Toss in shaman
and druids for backup healing.  Allow the enchanter around long enough to
buff right before cleric/shaman buffs, then they can leave.  A bard per
group would be great as well...hey, SOMEONE has to die first, and until they
do they'll add to that group with their wonderful songs.
