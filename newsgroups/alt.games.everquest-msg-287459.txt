i'm bound by those terms for as long as i chose to remain in contract
with sony

it's a private agreement that i'm willfully disrespecting

when i break my agreement with sony, i haven't broken the law, i've
subjected myself to the penalties within that agreement, which are
null

there's no law saying you have to do what you agree to ... when a
private agreement is violated, the agreement itself sets the terms for
"justice" which, in this case, would mean i'd have to pay sony
whatever "damages" they suffered as a result of me using my copy of EQ
privately (so $0) and i'd be unable to play on their servers (a shame
since i quit a while ago)



if you agree to paint my house for $1000, and you don't, did you break
the law? is there a law saying "you must paint someone's house if they
offer you $1000" or "you must do anything you say you will do" or
anything like that?
