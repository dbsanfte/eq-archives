It makes a big difference from my days as cleric, druid, and shaman, all 
of whom had to pick between medding and binding wounds... and the pick 
for each was naturally to med, getting enough mana to heal, spend it, 
and then med that back, was always faster than bandaging and so losing 
the sitting mana.

Yep, my berserker is at 157 so far, with a cap pre 51 of 200, 210 after 
that.  Thats nearly 40 hp per tic if I'm correct on how this works, with 
a potential of something like 52 per tic without any AA.  As a non 
healer, bandaging is now a very important tool for my soloing, and I've 
used it quite a lot in the odd groups I end up in with no healer or only 
hybrid healers.. pretty much any group that doesn't include a cleric, 
I've ended up doing at least some bandaging.

It was painful for my mage, who had a constant supply of bandages, to be 
capped so low.  My berserker is incredibly annoyed that the... I always 
forget the name, the dagger that procs bandages... at any rate, thats a 
one hander and so he can't have the supply of bandages my warrior had; 
because binding wounds is now a much more viable solution than it was 
back when I was playing Defeat, my froggie warrior.
