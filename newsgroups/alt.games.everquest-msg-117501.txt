The actual bug was that picking up *anything* as its timer
expired could cause program errors resulting in being
disconnected.  It wasn't limited to coins.

The reason they changed it so that coins couldn't be dropped
had a LOT more to do with a verified scam having to do with
trading across firepots.   The scam worked with items as well,
of course, but items could be traced.   Coins couldn't since they
aren't the same type of object.   Making it so people couldn't drop
coins fixed both the scam and, as a side effect, any LD issues with
people picking up coins about to "time out."

At any rate, the primary goal was to fix that scam, according to VI,
not to fix the LD issue.
