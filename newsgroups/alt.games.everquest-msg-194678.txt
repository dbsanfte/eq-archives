Once again you have succeeded in combining ignorance and illogic to
create something old...  You have become better at Stupidity! (13)
Combine weapons (magic weapons with same stats as finesteel) have
always been available form the gypsies, a Combine Longsword used to
be most melee's first magic weapon.  The main effect of the relatively
weak weapons and armor available back in pre-Kunark days was that the
minimum effective level for melees in a given zone was 2 to 3 levels
higher than today.  Between the weaker melee gear and the shortage of
neat caster toys (including mana regen, not only was there no KEI but
no Breeze either, no generic mana regen buff save the L29 Enchanter
spell Clarity), players generally had to work in groups of 5 or 6
with recovery time required between fights.  EQ then was more like
the PnP roleplaying games we old farts cut our teeth on, and less
like the arcade games you younger players grew up on.  It's too bad
that SOE chose to supermario-ize EQ, much of the flavor of the game
has been lost, but it was probably inevitable.
