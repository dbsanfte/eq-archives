>>> Is There a 2HB "normal" weapon for a half elf ranger?  all my research
has found all the magical and no drop items.  Was just wondering if anything
exists in the venure. <<<

You mean like a worn great staff, or a FS great staff? Is that what you mean
by normal? Here are some I found on eqmaps...

Hardened Driftwood Great Staff, dropped in Tenebrous Mountains
Shovel, dropped by Furball Miller in WK
Spiny Great Mace, dropped by a Bloodtribe Warrior in Scarlet Desert

if all you want is a 2HB, just look for an orc carrying a really long stick.
