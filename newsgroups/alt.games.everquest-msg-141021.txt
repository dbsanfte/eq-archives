    There is an Efreeti camp in Sol A as well. Dunno why this warrior was
going there, unless he's a dwarf - there are some lava rock drops there.

    I went to Sol B recently to res someone, and as I sat there waiting to
med back from 50m someone trained two LDCs to zone. So I soloed them both.
THAT felt good - light blue, too! The people I had ressed were just staring
at me, as though clerics were some sort of force of nature. ;-)

    LOL, I bet they have their passwords on sticky notes on their monitors
at home, too.

    You have to be in melee range to land spells on the giants. I've landed
MoR on giants before when I was on an informal FG raid one night (tank in my
guild died leading his party there, asked for a res, then "um, can you join
us and keep us alive?")

    It's melee-only. You couldn't have used it anyways.

    I'm stunned. Not a single tell asking you to re-apply Aegolism because
they didn't have crap buffs done right yet?

    As well he should be - it seems to be the norm on open raids.

    Ah, list-style rolling. Very nice - no scrolling back through a mile of
rolls. There was organization here!

    At that point it is traditional for the winner to do just about
everything humanly possible to rub it in to the others present that he just
won great loot, and they didn't. "OMG OMG OMG This is a GOD ITEM this sells
for a TON OF CASH!!!!"

    Is the Pope Catholic?

    Was he spam-inspected by the monks on the raid? ;-) Last night one of
our wizards (not sure which) started trying to x-loc people out after we'd
killed Grieg. Specifically, he tried to x-loc out all the other casters. I'd
never seen the "translocate to bind" confirmation box before. The wizard
that won the Geomantic Fingers of Focus had never seen it, either, but he
got to see it twice - once right before he went to loot, too.

> There are other

> themselves, dontcha know?

    Bah, item and song haste stacks. But it was a wee bit slanted from what
it sounds like. The bards either got a free default item, OR got the same
chance as everyone else to win something. Slightly biased treatment, but
considering that bards are pretty important to winning against Vox/Nagafen
not terribly out of line.

    Vox isn't as fun. There's respawns when you fight Vox, so if the raid
wipes you end up trying to protect the buff hall while people get ressed.
Nagafen, if somehow everyone dies you can sit there and help res/rebuff
without worry.
