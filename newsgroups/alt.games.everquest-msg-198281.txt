Well - since most of your gear is better than my mage main
at 61 - not many.  BUT - if you want to do any pet canni -
An overseer's ring or enshrouded veil for Summoning efficiency
3 and a summoning haste 3 item (I haven't got one yet, but
it looks like Brell's Belt has summoning haste 3 on it)

Yesterday I went from OOM with no pet to 75 mana with a 
buffed/equipped 61 airpet in just over 2 minutes (sitting
on a horse with PoT9 on) - This with only my summoned
spell haste ring (pet cast in 8.5 seconds) because BoR
had dropped and I don't have a summoning haste 3 item yet.

What's Earthweave?

Also you might consider an R-Click nuke (I don't know how
small a raid Velk would be for you - but BoBC are still one
of the great pieces of mage gear.  There's a 1hb with a
fire nuke that is only 8sec cast as well - don't know if
it's droppable or not)
