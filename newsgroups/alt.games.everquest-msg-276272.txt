LOL Drastically mate, it's changed drastically.

* Somewhere in the region of I think 3 new continents I believe it is, 
around the size of Antonica each I think they are...roughly. There's 
also the planes and all the instanced zones.

* The level cap went from 50 to 70

* They uprooted the Trolls, moved them to a totally new city after an 
invasion by the Frogloks, who took over the Trolls starting city

* They pretty much totally replaced the graphics engine over time, 
bringing in a DirectX powered engine making use of modern hardware, 
which I was always quite impressed by.

* Quite a lot of new content...probably thousands of items by now, not 
to mention all the new quests

* They added in the Plane of Knowledge portal system, which cut travel times

* A number of new races were added, and a few new classes too

The list extends much further but that gives you an example of just what 
to expect, and just how far they've gone to change original EverQuest. I 
expect similar from EQ2.
