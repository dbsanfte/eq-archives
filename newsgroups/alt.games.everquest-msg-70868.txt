Guilds, essentially, are just friends.  If you have enough friends that are
willing to dedicate enough time to help you get your epic, not being
guilded won't be much of an issue.   The big bottleneck is Ragefire and
that's going to depend on how it's handled on your server.   Some
servers are "first-come, first served" and you just need to make sure
you have the capability in-place to kill him when he spawns and make
sure no one else is in-place before you.   Some servers have lists, though,
and you add your name to the list and wait until it's your turn.  The cleric
at the top of the list usually has an hour to muster the forces needed
before the next cleric gets his turn.  Just asking any epic cleric on your
server should tell you whether yours has a list or not.

As far as whether it's worth it, that's up to you.   Mana-free rez's are
extremely useful after any death, of course.  And the stats on it are
damn nice too.  You can make it to 60, though, and function perfectly
well without it.

At any rate, without a guild or friends capable of getting enough people
in-place *on demand, not scheduled* to kill Ragefire, you'll never get it.
The rest of it can be planned.
