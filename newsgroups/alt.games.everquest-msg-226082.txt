This notion was proposed when advanced research first came out - it's
incorrect.  You can research 50+ mage spells and all 50+ priest spells.

Sorry, that was a *very* general observation.  I know that supposedly
certain mobs drop specifice components.  My druidess friend was determined
to get some research drop from the sun revs in the Gray - and we all
have our lucid shards and no research drop.
 
So, it's either very rare, or they don't drop it.

remember you can't get the skill until 16th and it maxes at 5 there.
