Well, not sure if all this is true but it WAS Brad who had "the
vision." If you notice "the vision" has not been mentioned as near as
I can tell on the EQ boards since Brad left. 

They seem to FINALLY be running this as a business that has customers
and that, wonder of wonders, WANTS TO KEEP THEM TO MAKE MONEY! That
works in our favor a lot more than someone having a "baby" and not
wanting their baby to be changed. 

All they need to do now to really make things great is less downtime..
ahaha.
