From past experience on how  they address this type of situation I imagine
that Verant will change to Ghoulbane so that the quested version is No Drop,
this will stop a lot of farming by people who do not gain exp.

I think you are right in the possibility of a change having to be made if
you can just wander around greens amongst some blues that are relatively
easy to kill and lvl from, Especially with your warrior, heavens above I
wish those mobs were there when I was lvling my warrior throught 35.

I can see an emergency patch coming our way soon.
