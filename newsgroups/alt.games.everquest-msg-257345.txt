I only used 2h'ers from Ssra to the EP to be honest. Prior to that was all
dual wield, post that was all dual wield. There was a brief period at
POP release when I had an EP bow before I got my SEWS that I used Archery
a lot too, but to be honest, looking back at my career Melee has pretty
much always outdamaged archery, and Dual wield has usually outdamaged
2hs.

Certainly at the moment (450 aa, time/god gear) I cant see any 2h'er that
would compare. I like it this way too ;)
