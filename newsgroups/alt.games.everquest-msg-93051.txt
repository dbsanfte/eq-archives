Use invis almost EVERYWHERE.  I have only alvl 25 necro that I don't even
use anymore, but it's better to be safe than sorry.  Even in FP or Qeynos
where you can walk around relatively safely, you never know when you will
walk into an NPC that will flip out on you.  I know in Qeynos I was usually
fine, but once in awhile would run into one of the McMannus clan wandering
around.  Then guards who normally don't bother with you will help out the
npc.  I've also had NPC's there leave me alone like everytime I walk by just
to have them get an attitude towards me even though I haven't had a bad
faction change.  The guy "Zamel" outside the bank has done that to me.
Walked right past him for 20 levels before he decided I should "die like a
dog".

Use invis, that's why you get it so early, hehe

Good luck,
SEAN...
