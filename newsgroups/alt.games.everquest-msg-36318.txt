Yesterday afternoon about 11 guildies and guests created gnomes, turned in
their PvP books and ran to Erudin.

The rules were simple:  PvP must be consentual (well, since it's bugged that
was moot) and nothing could be given to the racers, to avoid people giving
them sow/lev items, jewelry, armor, etc.

Awards were as follows:
1st, blue diamond
2nd, 1500p
3rd, 1000p
4th, 500p
5th, 200p

The winner & 2nd place contestants didn't die even once and took about
1:45 - 2:00 to make the trip.  The fifth place (me) took 3.5 hours and that
included dying once in EK at the bottom of the ramp (I hate that ramp) and
getting lost in HHP twice (I hate that zone :p ).

And a fun time was had by all.
