I mean full uninterupted nothing else to do but hang out and read days.

Then again, I don't mean reading at my natural pace, which would be about 6
books a day; I've trained myself to read slower, taking in sentences instead
of plowing diagonally thru paragraphs, enjoy what I'm reading more (and get
my money's worth).  For some reason when I taught myself to read it was
basically in a speed reader style as if getting thru books in record time
was the main thing.  I can't reccomend the practice, even to students; since
I'd read all my textbooks cover to cover the first couple days of class I
often had trouble in those classes later on in the year as my memory of what
I'd read got fuzzier and fuzzier, and I wasn't dedicated enough to the
material to go over it again and again to keep it fresh.  Being -able- to
read stuff with 100% comprehension at high speeds is handy, doing it all the
time as a matter of course is expensive and not actually all that effective.

Reading books at night after EQ to help put myself to sleep, a book often
lasts me a week or more; I'm deliberately reading slowly, I'm sleepy anyway,
and I tend to only read in 15 minute chunks before falling asleep.  Only
unfortunate thing is that a good book will keep me awake a couple hours till
its finished, which defeats the plan of having it there to lull me to
sleep... luckily there aren't as many really good books as all that!
