i was  only payed 1500 for my centi LS  well wirth it anyway id pay 3k  for
a weapon so nice

anyway a friend of mine  hunt maidens  alot where the centi weapons drop and
bigger that sheet ooo look a centi LS dropped  NON LORE  SAME STATS AS
BEFORE 14/27 8str 8sta

=( its sad   , but i think as mentioned above that   it probably started
from someone  had a centi SS and actioning a lore  centi  and then  someone
who had the LS  saw theirs wasnt lore and thought it was "pre-nerf"
