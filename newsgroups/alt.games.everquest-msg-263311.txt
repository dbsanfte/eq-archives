Having recently watched some videos of the EQ2 implementation of the griffon 
rail rides, and remembering the amazing trips I took in the WoW stress 
test... I've got to say I am disappointed by the animation of the EQ2 
version.  Can't really say much since I'm not in the beta, and only have a 
video clip to go off of, but in WoW the griffon soars, glides and banks.  In 
the EQ2 version it looks like it just flaps its wings and makes sharp turns 
(though the turn part could very well be masked by the fact that the person 
taking the video was incessantly spinning the camera around their 
character).
