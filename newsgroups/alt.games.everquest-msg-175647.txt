I don't remember when I did it, but I think I tried for levels you can
get your pet on it, then fear it, your pet will follow it and beat on
it, since it's a small island, he will just wander around alot, until
dead.  Or if you aren't afraid someone is going to steal your kill and
you are brave go over to cyclops isle and charm another cyclops bring it
back to kill the AC.  The AC is a standard cyclops so it isn't going to
be any harder than them.  I think it might have been 49 before I got it
but I camped it for several levels comming back when it wasn't camped,
it took me FOREVER for it to spawn.

The AC in South Ro is much easier to kill being 5 or 10 levels lower
than the one in OOT, but much more difficult to get ahold of and KSers
galore, if you are thinking of that one...

It does help alot, but with the price of sow potions, which are much
better you'd probably be better off using them until 51 at least when
you can go for run AA's...  Not to mention you'll want a horse
eventually.
