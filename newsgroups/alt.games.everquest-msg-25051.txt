I might guess you don't enjoy movies or live theater, either, based on
that comment.

Sure, *you* know the answer. That's not the point of role-playing
though. You are playing a character that might well *not* know the
answer to that question. 

>Nothing has changed. Gnolls still spawn. People still kill them. 

Apply your question scenario to the period of time after Kithicor
became haunted, or Befallen changed, or Runnyeye was liberated, or
Unpleasant Characters (whatever they were called) moved into the
Qeynos Hills, or Lesser Feydark was occupied by the minions of an evil
god, or Dark Elf camps showed up in West Commons and Lesser Feydark,
or Paw was overrun by a conquering tribe of Gnolls, or new dungeons
were unearthed on Odus, or two new continents were discovered.

Hmmm. It would seem that something *has* changed, after all.

Back to the theater thing... the script doesn't change from night to
night, but the show is still a pleasure to watch and perform.

Which is fine - no one requires you to roleplay. You pay your $10 per
month, and as long as it doesn't impact someone else's enjoyment you
can play however you want.
