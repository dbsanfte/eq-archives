Which is the point where you should have hit your
/em knees sexual_harasser_00 in the groin, smiles sweetly and says
"Try that again and I'll emasculate you." hotkey.

Either that or say "Does my moustache scratch you as much as it
scratches my wife? She's always complaining about it."

Next thing, you make this sound like this is some random boob (*heh*
*heh* He said 'boob'!) that you just met in the game. If  that's
the case then why do you care if he gets all offended? Smack the guy
down and let him know that you aren't in the game to be his boy toy.
The put him on /ignore.

Jerks like this are like leeches. If you let them get attached to you
it will cost you blood to detach them.

So, why are you telling us instead of telling him? Are you so passive in
real life that I could just walk up, hand you some flowers and chocolate,
and start frenching you? If so, send me your phone number. Unlike
most straight women, many straight guys find lesbian women to be
a turn-on. If, like your digital problem person, I am only in it for MY
gratification then your likes and dislikes really don't enter into the
equation anyway.

Sorry for the sarcasm, but I hope I've illustrated why you shouldn't
let this situation get past the first "kiss". "Talk to the hand, buddy!"
then  put him on /ignore.
