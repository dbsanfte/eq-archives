Yes, if someone just happens to buff you.
On 2nd thoughts, perhaps not for your first character as you are so
overwhelmed trying to take everything in. I did a lot bteer on levelling
my 2nd main chr faster when somone provided buffs, then I could really
suck the experience. Still forgot to keep maxing hand to hand and other
weapons though {:-).

They help, says he having passed a 300pp morning star to a newbie ranger
chr because it has a religion on it. bummer.

Ok, I only have classic EQ, so no bazaar, but here is my tips to help
with pp.

(pp is Platiunum pieces, gp is gold pieces, sp is silver pieces & cp is
copper pieces.)

My best tip is that the first thing to buy is a bag, then a back pack,
and another, etc. Loot, loot, loot loot, loot everything you kill and
everything you come across. Sell it to your guild for maximum price. CHA
(charm) is helpful in getting a better price, so if you come agross
something with good charm, keep it for when you are selling to guild,
merchants, etc

Lean what you need for newbie quest items and buy boxes to store the
bits in your bank slots. Most people ignore the fact that newbie chars
(well rangers and bards at least) can get some nice armour from just
collecting bits of things they kill as they level. 

Don't ignore the wearable stuff that you loot as a temporary measure.
You can also do basic tailored armour on skins that only bring 9cp as
they are little loss. Pity the pattern costs 5sp though.

Also keep an ear on /ooc and /shout for people wanting to buy stuff. Buy
a box and store this stuff in the bank. In GF (Greater Faydark -
Kelethin) people often pay 1pp for Crushbone belts from Orcs, who wander
the zone, which the vendors only give you a little for. Later, you can
run them to Kaladim for experience and gp, but sales for PP is better
for your cash.

(There will be similar ideas to above and below things in most zones.
Again web searching for your chr should bring some hunting guides up.)

At some stage, you will start farming CB belts to sell to people {:-) in
your spare moments.

Foraging in GF can bring Morning Dews which sell in zone for 20pp
(Morel-Thule), so do not discard anything you forage until you have
entered "item everquest" into http://www.google.com. This is a great way
to learn about quests and stuff.

I'm also collecting orc scalps and banking them with my newbie ranger,
because I learnt from my first chr, that I can turn these into Captain
Ashlan in HighPass for experience and 9gp. 7 Stacks so far. You will
pick this sort of tip up as you go along. So when my ranger hits 15 and
gets his second lot of spells, he will move out into the world beyound
GF & CB.

And full circle, it doesn't hurt to search through merchants as you
level. Occassionally some people sell some really good stuff like
weapons armour, etc (I guess they do) to merchants. My newbie ranger has
earnt enough to buy a full set of chain mail gear to complement quest
stuff from the merchants at level 12. Unfortunately I couldn't afford
the weapons I am seeing. Hmm, just worked out that I would have to take
16 stacks of orc scalps to Captain Ashlan to afford that rough recurve
bow at one on the merchants. Oh well, time for Orc carnage {:-)

Last tip, do not pay bazaar prices in zone. If they can not be buggered
going to the bazaar, you should expect to pay a lot less. Also, obtained
some nice stuff from "going out of business/leaving EQ" annoucements.
