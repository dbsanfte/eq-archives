While I have zero experience in Torment and Tactics and only about 0.0001% in
COD (popped in there on flagging, never killed one mob to this day there), I can
answer that question with regards BoT.

Plenty.  BoT does not have any mobs that absolutely positively must be killed in
30 seconds.  Not one.  Has plenty of ordinary melee mobs that can be killed in
anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes, like pretty much any other zone in the
game.  Oh sure, they may be really hard to kill, some of them may have high
damage outputs or procs that make you try to kill them faster... but not one
puts you on the razor's edge, pass/fail on a 30 second clock.  And if you do
find one to contradict that, you won't be able to find his three buddies that
have to be killed in 30 seconds each, and you sure won't find 3 more waves of
that to drain out your mana and then a boss mob that pops immediately on your LM
butt.

BoT doesn't restrict you to 6 people at a time, either.  Support classes are
welcome, raid mode is possible, medding is rarely impossible; the class
combination that gets you thru trials is not neccessary in BOT.

Further, although for some reason they are opening up BOT and those other
planes, the principle "wall" I see is the one keeping people out of POV/POS, not
so much BOT et al.  Again, in POV and POS you normally don't combat anything
approaching the restricted possibilities of Trial of Execution.  While the
fights can be hard, arguably too hard for sub 60s to cope with, you'll also see
level 62 people happily soloing there... often the very classes that are least
desired on trials (shaman and druids).

I don't see what trials particularly do to prevent this.  I mean, if you want to
prevent training people, the flagging event should require that you move around
in a crowded zone with lots of mobs for a couple hours, and if anyone dies in
the zone during that time to a mob that has you on the "hate" list, you lose
(and FD doesn't wipe the hate list)  If you want to prevent people dying, same
trial, but their own death stops that attempt, and when they try again if there'
still a corpse of theirs in zone, they fail.  Interfering with other groups,
hmm, I suppose we forget "someone dies to a mob that has you on the hate list"
and change it to "if any mob has more than 6 people on its hate list"

Of course people training, dying, and accidentally or on purpose have existed
since the dawn of EQ, nor do POS/POV/BOT seem free of this, so the current
trials aren't working to prevent it.

Perhaps the zones I think of as "third tier" (SOE would disagree) manage to
winnow this behavior out, although I can't think how.  Well I can, by being
percieved as more difficult to play in, and less necessary.  From 63 to 65,
there's no real option to exp anywhere lower tier than POS/POV, so those two
zones are where everyone but the elite gravitate.  If you get flagged for COD,
there's noone there to group with and noone LFG in POT looking for a group
there, so unless you feel like  soloing the place or have a ready made group for
it, you don't go.  BOT has some pickup groups, but to get them you had to put in
some effort in POS, hardly impossible but entirely unnecessary, the exp there is
no better than in POS/POV anyway.

HOH, Torment, Tactics, hey, I have no idea like I said.  If you get more exp per
mob there, then wow, the floodgates are about to open up wide.  Hopefully for
you, there are tiers above this where you can take an exp group and be happy,
because your worst nightmare is about to come true, those zones will look just
like POV does now, or PON, or KC or DL>..where-ever the exp is best at any given
level, thats where the 'bastiches' are going to go, whether they can handle it
or not.
