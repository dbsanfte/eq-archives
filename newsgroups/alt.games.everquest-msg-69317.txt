All of which spawn in groups, wander in groups, and agro in groups.
The guards are not nearly close enough. The small canyon between the
mob-freeway and the Halas Cave with guards is always littered with
dead lowbies.

And you forgot the ever present Vengful Skels that look like a
decaying skel wandering about. Even if you manage to run from them,
they more often then not latch on to some poor bastard you pass on
your way to the guards.  I wouldn't call any newbie area with lvl8-10
mobs (indistinguishable from a level 1 decaying) wandering regularly
through a good one.

Feerrott
Innothule Swamp
South Ro
Rathe Mountains
Cazic Thule (best unused dungeon in the game)
Upper/Lower Guk

All within 3-4 zones.
