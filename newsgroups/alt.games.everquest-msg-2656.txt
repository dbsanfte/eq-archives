You can change almost all the colors in the text window the way you want.
You can do it ingame, but I suggest to edit the file, cause it can take a
while to get it just right.

First you edit the eqclient file, you'll find these numbers:

User_1_Red=0
User_1_Green=0
User_1_Blue=0

Then you open the eqmanual_supplement file, which tells you what the numbers
between the underscore _ means. you'll find that User_1_ is "say" and
User_2_ "tell" etc.

Now, it can take a while to figure out how the colors are going to be if you
change the red, green or blue values. However the values have to range from
0 to 255. In the example from above where all the values are 0 the color
will be black, and if all are 255, yep you guessed it, the color will be
white.

Btw as I started out, I said you can change almost all colors, the /cons are
among the few that can't be changed since there is more than one possible
/con

Good luck
