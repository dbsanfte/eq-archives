Wolfie, thank you for the lengthy explanation! I now have a working model in
my mind of the color of these guys. Of course, I knew that if it's green,
you ain't gonna get any exp for it. I didn't know the other stuff, and for
that, I thank you yet again.

I'm a druid (my main is anyway), lvl 18. I've been fear kiting stuff for at
least 2 lvls, and I assume that from what people have said here and I've
read online, that that will change at my next lvl when I get better spells.
My tactics will have to change in some ways as well, and I can certainly
deal with that.

Speaking of the undead... I was at the chessboard a few days ago and managed
just fine to kill the back two mobs, though one was a caster (this was as my
enchanter). I thought (foolishly) that I could pull them all, one by one and
get good exp. Of course, you know what happened... I pulled the one in the
very back and he brought his friend along with him. Is there a secret to
working the board for an enchanter? Anyone can chime in here and I'll be
happy. I still can't seem to get mez to stick... must not work quite like
harmony... would like to get some exp here and so far can only pull 2 of the
undead. sigh.

TIA
Darklet
