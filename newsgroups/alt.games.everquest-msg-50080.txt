And even if they do see invis, they are more of an annoyance than a
real problem.  I've seen people killed by other PCs while charmed, but
I've never died to the sirens.

Hmmm, I never really had a problem with this.  I would say it was a
bit bigger than tiny, since I've seen full raids setting up there.
Sure it's tight, but I would say you had 10 feet from the wall outside
of aggro range.

Bah, I only made it to SG the 2nd day of Velious.  Was way too young
to be in SG, if I had even known it existed.  Hunting wyverns with a
group of low/mid-40s was great exp though.  I also got a CS key that
time, too bad I didn't get a SS key then too.
I made it to SG pretty early on though, long before there were any
decent maps.  Nothing but nothing would stick to those MR resistant
mobs, they hit HARD, and ran for help at any opportunity.  I think
some of the best fun I've ever had was watching our guildleader single
pull the castle.  It failed a lot more than it worked, and made for
some IMPRESSIVE trains.  Oh, and remember those bastard icy terrors or
whatever?

Yeah, run through CS is trivial at best, and if you've not ruined
Othmir faction, you can train any wyverns that attack to them.

I wouldn't recommend it.  I saw a GM with GM invis pop into view and
give account warnings to several people for self-succor this weekend.
I still find SG one of the hardest zones to get through, since I have
never been able to get past those damn seahorses without getting
aggrod.  I've tried all the tricks, and I still get hit, but maybe I'm
doing it wrong.  If I don't get stunned I'm fine, but one stun and I'm
looking for a monk and a cleric.

This is a trivial run, if you have invis.  You need to have invis
though, and it's still WAY too long a run to look for a pick-up group.
Hell, sometimes it's even too long if you know a group is there
keeping a spot open for you.
(Side-rant:  How in the hell do otherwise competant people get
characters to 60 without knowing how to travel?  As a bard, I run
rather than port unless I'm avoiding a boat, but everyone has to run
from port-in to camp site.  I have NEVER died crossing WW solo, but
crossing with a group just terrifies me.  I give the shpeil about all
auto-follow leader, keep angle down so don't fall if you lag, tell
leader to listen to stop calls, basic stuff, but has to be repeated.
By the time I get to third-person view we are out of the tunnel,
heading straight out across the zone, and running right into big,
named, see-invis dragon.  First, you're going the wrong way, second,
you ran into a mob, and third, you didn't even con him!  Sorry, I'll
go look up a cleric with the Brell's Blessed Stout bracer and calm
down.)

You ran a naked warrior to DN? I assume you had a guardian casting SoW
and invis at least.  The question is why?  What no-drop twink piece is
good enough to go through the trouble?

I would think that the hardest part about taking Lord Bob (or Lord
Djamalamalongname as I call him) with a single group would be just
getting to him.  Those specs are fun.
