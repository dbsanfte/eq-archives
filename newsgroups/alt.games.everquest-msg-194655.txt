Well one big prob is that this "solution" really screwed up the death
penalty. Since that penalty is based on the amount of raw xp it took
to complete the previous level. In other words dont have unrezed
deaths at 52, 55, 60. Course we try not to have thoses anyway lol.

As for AA they caught that and fixed it now the mods only go toward
the XP total not AA. Sighs....
