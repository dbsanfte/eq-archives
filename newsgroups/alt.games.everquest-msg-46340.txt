Heh... I'll stop short of saying "I hope not"... but I was thinking of 
flogging my bard's GSB for 1k to some desperate monk as soon as he grabs 
his Mask of the Deceiver from lower guk. This would probably drive the 
prices down a lot, but it's still a welcome improvement... Although it 
would be even cooler to have humas simply adapt their vision to the 
darkness as the night goes on. Start off night-blind, but see pretty well 
after an hour or so.

I'll test that tonight... If it's true, that would probably have some 
effect on which character I play in FV. I always play humans, and the 
reason I chose a Wizard over a Cleric is that clerics don't get any 
night-vision spells, ever.
