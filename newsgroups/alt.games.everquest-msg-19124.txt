How is a password of "love69" easy to hack in Everquest?  If it were,
say, a Unix password, and the cracker had a copy of the encrypted
password file, I see how it would quickly fall to the normal
variations of a dictionary attack.

However, in EQ, the cracker does not have access to Verant's encrypted
password database (or the password hashes, if that's what they use).
It seems to me that they will have to do their attack by actually
running EQ and going to the login screen and typing each candidate
password until they hit it.  This seems pretty unlikely.

If people really do attack EQ that way, I hope Verant logs login
attempts.  It should be pretty easy to detect someone trying to do a
password guessing attack.
