Quite the expected response from yourself.

Given just how broken Rangers are, it's quite farcical to suggest that
monks might do more than token damage.  In the post 60 game, Monks are
well behind Rogues, Wizards (outdoors), Rangers, Mages, Necros even a
Warrior using Aggressive Discipline should expect to outdamage them.
Monks have had no attainable upgrade to weapons outside of the uberguild
arena for 2 and a half years, for a non-primal monk, your damage is
shit.

Monks were roughly balanced before hte nerf, now they are just utterly
pointless.  6th on the damage list, not even on the tanking list.  A
class which has paid a 20% experience penalty (until 18 months ago) and
continues to pay with a restrictive weight limit for what?  For the
ability to tank.  yet that was removed.  The nerf almost exactly equates
to the fucking bonus that monks get!
