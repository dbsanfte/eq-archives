Role-playing game.  Well, duh.  No matter how "feeble" your extremely
important opinion may think it is, if that's the reason (and I believe it
could be), it's not "feeble" to those who have respect for others enough to
FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE GAME.

You have no respect for me or the others who don't try to BS their way out
of playing by the rules that they know very well.
