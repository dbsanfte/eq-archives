Lower Guk, the granddaddy of all dungeons.  You learn all you need to know
about dungeons here.  Root parking, lack of sow, running mobs in curvey
dungeon halls, learning your way around a semi-maze, etc.

I can tell when an applicant to my guild has come up through Guk and when
they've come up through DL/BW.  The difference is striking.

Also it's simply a good place to hunt, both for experience and for cash.
