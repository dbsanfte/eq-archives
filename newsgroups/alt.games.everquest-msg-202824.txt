I am playing a rogue as my main now for two months up to level 31. I
must say that there are absolutely not good resources for rogues on
the web. Sure there is The Safehouse but that site utterly sucks
compared to all the other class based websites around.

A good page to take a look at is http://kikyara.tripod.com/ if you
plan to make poisons. It sounds a very promissing business but as an
untwinked rogue, fresh on server I still don't have the cash to
finance this skill.

Most important advice to give you is too keep your skills up. As a
rogue you are the class most dependant on skills so get them up. Pick
pocket ever green you see - and if you pick pocket white or lower mobs
in a group; the group will never be able to tell that you did (unless
you happen to pick pocket away that one item that they ALWAYS drop).
Becareful on higher mobs though. Might get embarrasing if they yell 
<STOP! THIEF! YOURNAME!> 
Prepare to be LFGing for ages and ages. The rogue is (at least at my
server) very very underrated and it's just about one of the must sucky
classes when it comes to soloing - never ever solo if it ain't green
(yes; I have been gotten asswhoped by light blues on many occassions).
And don't ever even think that you are a tank :o)
