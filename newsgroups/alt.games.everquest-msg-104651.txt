First of all, don't expect the greens to stop attacking you because you
made a few levels. We went in there last month (three of us) and the
lowest member of the group was 53, and everything STILL jumped us, right
from the entry. You'll either invis, or fight your way in. I reccomend
fighting, personally. In case it goes south, it's nice to know that at
least part of your path to zone is clear of adds for the "RUN FOR YOUR
FUCKING LIFE!" portion of the festivities.

Work down past the lake, clearing all the green mobs, then through the
tunnels and up the ramp to the castle entry. Once that flat area in
front of the castle is clear, sit and med/buff up. Send in puller and
clear the front hall and be sure to have them pull the mobs hanging in
front, including the gargoyles who are above the hall in those raised
alcoves. We usually go to the left, through the dining room. That root
seems easier. It's nice to set up back in the hall near the kitchen,
because there's only a couple wanderers, and you can pull chefs and the
butler/maid rooms between gypsy spawns. Once the path is clear you can
start pulling the dancers and musicians from the ballroom on out to your
camp. Watch out for the gargoyles. They can aggro in mass and be a
serious PITA if your puller strays off into the wrong area. And be
prepared to stay a while. We were actually camping the maid for a head
item for a friend, and it took FOREVER for some reason. About eight
hours total on that camp, and we saw ONE set of drums.

Oh, and don't underestimate that place, either. A lower level friend was
poking his nose in too far at the entry, got swamped and yelled for
help. We stupidly made the dash from maid all the way to the castle
entry hall, aggroing everything on the way. They may be green but they
wiped us.

*sigh*
