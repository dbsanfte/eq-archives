I still wish they'd make the damn thing persistent, although
I agree it's very useful as a DoT and was useful before as
well when dealing with green aggro mobs.

On a side note, I'm not ready to start actually tanking blues
yet for XP, but I was very successful farming hill giants with
the new tactics last night as well as actually stopping and
dealing with a couple of mini-trains in Dawnshroud instead of
just dragging them to the zone.

Not counting the UHOF, I was averaging around 18 or 19 DPS
purely on melee, no nukes at all.  Add in normal 56 cleric
buffs, no KEI or FF, and never using more than 20m per kill
even including a heal afterwards, and I could effectively
farm non-stop.  Lowest health got was down to around 60%
when the procs were slower;  some fights ended at 80%+.

It was fun actually out-pacing the 55 ranger and 54 paladin
in the zone.  Well, fun for me; they didn't seem too happy
about it.  ;)

All-in-all a nice change, but I'd still like to see a cleric
group enhancement at 54 to offset the shaman/druid "CHeal"
before they go live so clerics have some group viability
between 54 and 56.  The UHoF change alone isn't enough at
that level, IMO.
