If it procs a disease cure, I'm pretty sure the cure would be cast on
the pitcher, not the catcher, like the Glowing Black Sword.  If this
were not true, you would be able to cast a beneficial spell on a mob. 
Also, since Shaman slows are cured by using a disease cure, this would
be the perfect tool to use to cause major grief for raiding guilds. 
Competition for high end targets leads guilds to sometimes screw each
other over.  I can only imagine what would happen if these people were
now able to remove the slow debuff from major raid targets.
