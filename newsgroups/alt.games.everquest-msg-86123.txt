When looking at your skills and you see specialize, you actually know
which one is which for the specilization...(gawd that is setup stupid)

Raid chat, and multiple group experience.....
Raid group invite.... I.E.  you are able to see all HP for people on
the raid.  (i'm a cleric sometimes assist doesn't get the one you
need)
a quick key to select the one in your group with the Lowest HP ratio.
(so I can target that enchanter in another group that is really low)

they have a target group buff... how bout a target group heal... I
have not been able to get that to work.(guess its not a buff :p)

Guild management tools... able to get a list of all players in guild,
whether they are on or not.  

Fix the Bazaar. and make it a place accessible to all even those that
don't have Luclin or any other expansion.  (would make it more viable
to all)

 oh you said one didnt you...   well you got more than that heheheheh
