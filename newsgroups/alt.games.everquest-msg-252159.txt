Nah - we just like seeing morons thrash after they make stupid
claims here.  Your complete ignorance of the difference between
highly parallel, floating point intensive applications and the
linear, mostly integer nature of the eq client (not including

piece of hardware), coupled with your belligerent posing and
insistence on calling other people morons just made my day.
