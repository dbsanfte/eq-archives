You're probably thinking of me talking about E'ci's public raiding force.

We were well past Time though.   During the OOW era, they were the strongest
raid force on the server.   The server itself was less advanced than some
others in terms of raid groups, but they were the farthest.  I think they made
it past Uqua... maybe past the GoD level after that.   I know they beat at
least a few of the OOW trial raids before I quit.

I'm not sure if they're still active though.    I popped in a month or two
after WoW / EQ2 release, and it seemed like they had mostly collapsed.   I
haven't played since, so I don't know if they recovered.
