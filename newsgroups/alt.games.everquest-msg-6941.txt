Some people sat 100 and others say 105 but I believe it also concerns the
item being purchased for the Tinkerers Bag my wood elf druid needs to have a
Cha of 113 to get the bag at 5250p and he cons amiably with the Gnome
Vendor. This may be a fluke or a bug don't know. But with a Enchanter Cha is
more important then just prices. Cha greatly helps with Charming and Mezing
and that's way more important then a few plat you may save.
