Awww, it looks like Andre *Lieven* must have really hurt the feelings of
some pathetic loser with a tender ego. Obviously, this dorque feels so
outclassed and threatened by Andre that he knows the only way he can
possible fight back is with a pathetic spoof. Poor chickenshit. Tssk. All
because his mommy tried to gender norm him by dressing him up as a girl. Who
knew he'd only end up giving blow jobs down at the bus station.
