Wow, an ancient rumor seeks new life!

AGI has nothing to do with run speed in EQ.
It has been tested many times by many players.
I repeat, AGI has nothing to do with run speed in EQ.
It is true that when you are slowed by encumbrance your AGI also
takes a hit.  And so some of those who tested the effect of AGI
on run speed encumbered themselves and then buffed the snot out
of their AGI, with no effect on their run speed.
Once again, AGI has no effect on run speed in EQ.

Video lag will kill run speed.  AGI has nothing to do with it.  Valid
testing requires same connection, identical equipment (mobo, processor
video card, & etc.), same video/chat options in game, and etc. (i.e.
anything that could impact the performance of the game engine must be
equalized).  Best test uses same character or pair of characters with
AGI buffed to different levels and enough samples to spot and toss any
outliers caused by lag spikes.  Slow processor or slow graphics will
make you run slow.

Once again, AGI has no effect on run speed in EQ.
