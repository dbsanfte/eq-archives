You know if you hadn't posted this I would have missed your point.  When
I read...

>Typically, the whole anti-newbie thing stems from a feeling on inadequacy.
>Since these people feel so crappy about themselves,.....

the first time I thought you were talking about folks who feel that
there is an anti newbie thing and their feelings of inadequacy leading
them to feel persecuted.  

Now where you saw Lok saying that "only stupid people need a common
enemy" is something you are gonna have to elaborate on.  I mean I've
reread her post several times and you really would have to take her
words pretty far out of context to arrive at the conclusion that she had
said that.  While you are explaining that part, can you also give some
insight on just what it is about hating the stupid that bothers you so
much?  Obviously you were offended that Lok IDed them as the common
enemy of intelligent folk everywhere, something personal in that
bothering you?
