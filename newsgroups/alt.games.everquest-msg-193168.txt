I need some of the spider threads for the coldain shawl quest, and i was
hoping to get them without going too far inside. I 2-box with a 54 monk but
I am wondering if he'd just be a liability there? Is it possible to kill
these spiders with my back to a zoneline?

Also, I'm find the tribals/rockhoppers at the caves in dsp hopelessly
overcamped by people seeking shards; really annoying when you are trying to
get xp and it's a sea of green to them, especially when they ks and train
you. I wanted to be able to improve tailoring (193) whilst getting xp at the
same time. Is there any other zone where i can do this? I tried cobalt scar
but fishing is incredibly dull , especially as you can't just set it to
autofish the cobalt cod and throw away the fish scales... i'd rather have a
failure than have a useless 5 copper item cluttering space, like those shoes
and rusty daggers.

Still, it looks like the only option for a tailor at my level is to do those
vellious tailoring with arctic wyvern hides and cod oil?
