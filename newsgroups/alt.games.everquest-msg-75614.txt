And those are better than Jobner, how?

I don't see a problem with any of your names, even if I could catch the
reference, because they pass the obscurity test for me. Of my own chosen
names, some are meaningless (Saharrach the Necro, Milrahir the Cleric)
and some are references (Hanrahan the Druid, Parsifal the Bard, Rhialto
the Enchanter and Phlebas the Magician "a fortnight dead"). As far as I
know, all of them pass the obscurity test, except for the occasional nod
from the odd person who catches the reference, the same way that I will
make a point of congratulating someone with a particularly clever name,
which both shows flair, culture *and* blends perfectly with the fantasy
environment.

As far as I'm concerned, there is a difference between Thror (the name
of Thorin's grandfather and played by a dwarf warrior, of course) and
Phrodo, Phroddo, Gandallphhh, Gandddlf, Dritttzzzzz and their
variations, although I wouldn't go as far as petitioning those.

The bottom line is, there are names that bother me and names that don't.
GMs are the ultimate authority of what names are appropriate or not. If
I see a name that bothers me enough to report it, it only means that I'm
bringing it to the attention of a GM, who may or may not agree with me.
Hell, may even be that my own name doesn't pass the obscurity test for
him and makes me change it, in which case I'll do so with good grace.
