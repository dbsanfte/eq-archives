watch for the Ritualist spawn in the back of the maze, drops 1-2 pieces of
darkforge everytime and is the easiest to get to... i've run into him as
level 29 up to 34 (based on his harm touch)

he can easily be solo'd near high 30's, so have the SK pop in to see if he's
up every now and then..... enter CT, cast Sense the Dead to locate his pet,
if he's up he'll be the first one conned.

Crusaders are a bit different, they'll pop everywhere but the maze, usually
in the 4 corners area, the pools, and sometimes above the templar.... the
templar spawn is a pain in the ass due to the mass agro, the pools a bit
easier because you can pull him out of agro range of others, the 4 corners
temple probably the best place to get him but you have to watch for healers
in the area.

while hunting in RM, i'd always check into CT on my way to the bank to see
if there was a pop...... i've quested 3 full suits of Darkforge already, its
still fun as hell
