Think the GMs will give you a quest to do it, if youre lucky and the GM 
is feeling generous. The level 9 i was guilded with talked to a GM and 
was promised a quest for it 5 days after he got in trouble. I finally 
convinced him to start over instead, would be a LOT faster to get those 
9 levels than wais 5 days, and if the GM for some reason would be busy 
then he could wait even longer.
