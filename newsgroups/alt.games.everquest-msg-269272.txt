Looking out from the harbor, turn left, go around until you're in the
next plaza, look right after you go in, there's a building there with
a guy named Ian somethingorother. That's your spot.

You'll want to remember it, Ian is the one with the Qeynos armor
quests that everyone and their dog is doing in the 20s. :-)

Btw the sub-everquest newsgroups are dead as far as I know.
