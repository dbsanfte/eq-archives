Oh, and your never one to go off on the deepend?  We all have
pointless bitching... When has bitching ever done any good?

So, you have never been frustrated.. and just piped off cussing about
the immediate problem?  Never smaked your knucles while trying to pull
the damn alternator off the car?..   If you have, why did you , it was
pointless, and counterproductive...
and if you havent... well I guess you are just beyond human.  Or very
in control of your emotions, just as a Vulcon (star trek).

Later...  8 )
