I've always believed 95 to be a fairly decent OS for the home computer and
games.  I viewed win98 as basically 95 with all the service releases / fixes
etc included and just resold.  I still believe 98' is very similar to 95'
(and it is!) but the fact that 95 no longer supports direct x 8.1 and eq now
requires it (for whatever programming reasons they have) is not really their
fault, but MS for not support 8.1 on top of 95.

I just recently upgraded to 98, I see no major performance increase or
anything, but it definitely is better with device detection and that alone
was worth the upgrade to me.  Once I get an improved machine, I will likely
even move to XP, that looks fairly slick.

Cheers, and upgrade already! :)
