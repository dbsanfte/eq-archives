It appears to me to have been a bug in the patcher. One of my PCs can't 
display the skills box, and one can. I also noted that one of my PCs 
doesn't have many of the maps that my other PC has (things like the 
Warrens for example).

An "advanced" patch attempt might solve the problem, otherwise 
reinstalling EQ almost certainly will. The ini workarounds certainly 
work... but I'm worried now that something *else* might have been missed 
by the patcher...
