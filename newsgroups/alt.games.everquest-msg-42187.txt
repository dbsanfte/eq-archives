This will sound like ranting or posturing but it is in fact genuine
puzzlement.  I have to wonder exactly what is told to people in terrorist
nations.  Haven't they heard of high technology?  Don't they know about
smart bombs and advanced tactics and elite soldiers so highly trained and
well-equipped they're scary even to have on your side?  Do they think we're
all made of tissue paper or something?  Are they told that our soldiers are
small, weak, and stupid, and that they go into battle barefoot and armed
only with feather dusters?  Are they told that our planes aren't worthy of
dusting crops?  If the U.S. was only the size of New York State we'd STILL
have the muscle to swat Afghanistan like a fly, because as I understand it,
there's nothing there: no heavy industry, not much population, no high-tech
fighter jets, and dubious nuclear capability.  They must be told that we're
a weak collection of decadent pushovers you couldn't use to prop a door
open.  That's the only explanation I can think of.  The reason we often
don't retaliate isn't because we're weak.  It's because the absolute best
they can throw at us is like a mosquito bite.  It hasn't yet been worth
raising our hand to slap, but it's certainly getting there.  Don't any of
them ever learn enough to count themselves lucky that we've left them alive?
