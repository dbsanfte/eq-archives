You are very keen on pointing out what you see as errors in my logic
yet you offer no verification of your own other than to attempt to
insult with less than impressive sarcasm. Oh and parroting the Sony
line.....almost forgot that. Outside of accepting what sony says have
you any proof of any kind? Didn't think so. Come on this is Usenet you
can do better than that.

As for numbers haven't seen any independent verification on Sonys part
either. They(VI) once were making the claims of xxx,xxx number of
players but finally had to back off that when Sony was looking into
buying them, it magically became xxx,xxx number of accounts
(subscriptions). 

Consider the source of the patch message, same ones that nerfed the
monk class cause they would be too strong in pop, That's their
explanation btw,  and no one has seen anything yet to back that up
though three freaking tiers of pop. Maybe we should start a thread on
things SoE/VI promised that never happened or claimed and was caught
in a lie. Oops gotta include the one about ENHANCED customer service
by pooling GMs.  Lets see the web functions for Storm Hammer/Legends
comes to mind also, promised and sold but never delivered in any
useable form.  

Can list more if you would like to start a new thread.

In short after three years Sony/VI has zero credability with a lot of
us. So why do we play? The game is not Sony, it stands alone as better
than sony or vi ever was or ever could be. Great game, lousy companys.
The visionaries that made and developed the ideas of the game are
gone. what's there now is...well I don't know what they are.
