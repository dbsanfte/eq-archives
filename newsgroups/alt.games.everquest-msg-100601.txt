Certainly we paid for expansions, but a one-time fee doesn't cover
on-going cost associated with those new expansions - notably the
machines/maintenenace they represent.

Besides which, distributors typically take a rather large chunk of the
cost of such expansions, with the originating company seeing only a
fraction.

But the cost of the bandwidth on a per-unit basis very possibly has
increased. Just as we pay Verant for a service, they pay others.

But the cost of additional people to maintain those servers has not
gone down in that time. You need more people, and each person likely
costs more now than three years ago.

According to this site, inflation has been 8.3% in that time.

Not really relevant anyway, as inflation is only a useful concept when
discussing the prices of static items. EQ is not static - it has
steadily added content and game improvements over the past three
years.

Numbers are funny things, aren't they? They allow you to pick which
representation best supports your opinion, often in extreme ways.
While you look at this (numerically correctly) as a 30% increase, I
see it as a $3 a month increase. Or as a ten cents a day increase.

So, what kind of scale will you be using to measure a ten-cent-per-day
improvement in customer service?
