You really are quite laughable, but I'll play along one more time.

When I play a group dependant class and none of my friends are
currently online or in the zone I want to hunt in, I have to rely on
pickup groups. It is incredibly difficult to find a pickup group when
you have to compete with mega-buffed players. A group with a KEI'd
Druid or Shaman has no need for a Cleric (or 2nd Shaman/Druid). A
group with a mega-buffed Monk or Ranger has no need for a Paladin or
Warrior to tank mobs. A group with a KEI's Wizard has no need for a
second wizard or mage. You either go and get the same buffs yourself,
or spend the evening LFG.

No it is NOT the same point. Try to follow along, I realize it's hard
for you.

Non-solo classes could solo with KEI (and the other mega-buffs). They
could exp faster solo than in a group, so they didn't group. It's as
simple as that, and it is not the same point as above. It is related
due to the fact that it affected the number of available pickup
groups, but that is all.

Wrong again chuckles, but I won't waste anymore time on you after this
post.

Point 1 addresses the fact that groups with KEI do not need as many
members, limiting the number of available groups for group dependant
classes.

Point 2 addresses the fact that traditionally group dependant classes
could solo with KEI (and other buffs), thus further reducing the
number of available groups (and group members) for group dependant
classes.

Point 3 addresses the fact that people used their mega-buffs as
marketing tools to get into groups, and were more often than not
invited over those that were not buffed.

So far the only thing you have "destroyed" is your credibility. All
three points share a common root. The fact that KEI (and the other
mega-buffs) skew game play at the lower levels and completely alter
the roles and utility of classes in groups.

Well if you can't see the difference between the 3 points I have made,
then there is little point in attempting to enlighten you any further.
