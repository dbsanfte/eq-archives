Both cards are excellent, and would be a great upgrade. You will be
blown away by the improvement over your TNT2. PNY makes great GF
cards, so you can't go wrong with either model.

The GF4 is faster than the GF3. I don't think it is $50.00 faster, but
that is my personal opinion.

You can find some reviews with benchmarks at:
