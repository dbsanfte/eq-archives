My level 15 TSK levelled up to level 16 FOUR TIMES in Oasis this weekend. In
one day too. My group went to that temple looking place for orcs, and none
stop killing. When healers went OOM, I died and lost level 16. Came back,
levelled up again, and died again and lost 16 again. Eventually I gave up,
and make 16 a couple more times in other group. He's now 1 and a half bubble
into 16. Shouldn't lose it again.

My level 13 shaman made it to level 14 in Oasis. Yep, orc highway as well.

My level 14 monk made it to level 15 in Oasis. Yep again, orc highway.
