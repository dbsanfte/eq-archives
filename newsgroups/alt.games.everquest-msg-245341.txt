For me, pricing has everything to do with what my primary purpose
was when I got the item. I see lots of people who regularly price
foraged items or items made out of foraged items for what is, IMO,
too much. But it's too much *for me* because I never go out and
forage just to be able to sell something. All of my foraged items
that I offer for sale have been gotten incidentally while I was
doing something else so pricing it at, say, 100 plat seems silly
to me. Anything that I get for it is pure profit and didn't even
cost me any time because I wasn't there to get it anyway.

Another example would be Rallic packs for me. I have been farming
(and farming and farming and farming even more) acrylia in TM and,
when you're in the second cave, the runner (if he's not killed
before he gets there) comes right into the cave. I've probably
gotten and sold 20 or 30 Rallic packs over the last few months.
And I price them MUCH lower than others who offer them because
killing him and grabbing his pouch costs me nothing.
