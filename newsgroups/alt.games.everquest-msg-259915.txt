Because, at least in this case, the designer can do something about.
For instance, lock the mob to whoever hits it first, so you can't get
the benefits of grouping (faster kills) without actually grouping (the
EQ2 solution).  Or make it so whoever does the most damage gets the
rewards, so a group will typically beat anyone who doesn't group (the
EQ1 solution).  The second, of course, allows killstealing, but
rewards grouping heavily as groups will usually outdamage soloers.
The first doesn't make it quite as desirable to group, as long as you
can take your victim down on your own (which I think is how most WoW
quests are supposed to work, to enable soloability).

Those choices were available to Blizzard, but they choose instead to
reward the one who hits it first.  That may be a reasonable choice,
but it would seem there are other methods that would foster teamwork
(or grouping, at least) better.  Of course there could be advantages
to their method that I don't see right now, especially as I'm actively
trying to pick holes in it.  Also, let's not forget that the stress
test is probably isn't that indicative of how things will work in the
real game - there are a lot more players, and many of them may never
have played an MMORPG (beyond Diablo 2, anyway) before.
