I've set off traps with /inspect.  I know that had to be the reason, because
everyone else had already run back to zonein after a win and so I was the
only one even near it.  When I did /inspect, bang.  So then I tried /open,
set off the trap again.  Then I said screw it and beat the chest into
submission, which set the trap off yet again.  :)
