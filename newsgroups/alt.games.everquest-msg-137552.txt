I take back the part about your friends.  A know it all jerk like you
doesn't have any friends.  I don't care what you think - what I said is the
truth and everyone who knows me on my server knows it is the truth.  I still
hunt with people who I was level 6 with.  You are, as I expect it often the
case, 100% wrong.  Oh, don't know what to say about your thousand year-old
grudge.  Hang on to it if you like, lol.
