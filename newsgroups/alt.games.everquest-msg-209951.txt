a healer can tell the difference between 3000 hp and 3450 hp ?

that 450 hp can be, for the example of the op's frustration, the difference
between a twink and a non-twink

btw 450 is 15% of 3000, unless i am horribly mistaken, which is what i
should have used as my example, instead of saying 2800 in place of
3500....( i was thinking about different classes), and also roughly the
number the op gave

at least the difference between 3500 and 2800 is more than 1 sup. heal, but
don't clerics use heal-over-time's and ch or that hella-fast-cast-heal or
whatever? who sits there and counts every heal vs what % difference it made
in the target's hp bar ? clerics trying to compensate for soem bordom? =p

anyway, i'd find it hard to believe that someone can find a ~500pt hp
difference without knowing the gear of the player

and would a 50 warrior with 3500 hp tank better than a 55sk with 3000 hp?
i'd say they'd be about the same.....

and, assuming i'm wrong about this whole thing, please - and i do mean this
seriously - explain how a healer will know, i'd like to hear that

(we can turn this thread around into good info ~ )
