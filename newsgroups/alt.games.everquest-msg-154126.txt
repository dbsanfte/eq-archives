You should stay far, FAR away from the childfree newsgroup.

I think his point was, people fixed the wrong problem.  A vast
majority of parents these days are lazy as hell because it's everybody
*else's* job to parent their children, not theirs.  And as a
discussion a while back pointed out, it's destroyed a lot of good
toys.  We're moving towards a point where every toy on the market is
going to be a nerf toy, because some parent didn't feel like
supervising their kids, or didn't feel like pointing out to them that
"this is dangerous, be careful, do not aim it at other people", or
because they handed a toy to a child too small to use it safely.  I
know a woman who handed an *open pop can* to a 1 year old child - ever
felt the rim of the opening?  Imagine her fingers getting stuck in
there now - and then tell me who's at fault, the pop company, or the
woman.  There was also a story in a local paper a couple years ago
about a little girl being struck by a car in the road.  She was like 3
years old, and her mother was *inside*, not paying the slightest
attention to where the kid was.  Even worse, because imagine how the
poor driver of the car feels.  I hate driving through areas I know
children play in because even the slowest moving car can seriously
injure or kill a small child, and you can't watch everywhere at once.

*ahem*  /rant

Anyway.  Yes.  His point was, non-education paired with oversheltering
is the wrong answer to the problem.  He just chose to make in a
non-ranty way and a way that frankly, many others have too.  Ever seen
the Darwin Awards?  Welcome to the celebration of other people's
deaths.
