Richard struggles with the huge burden of continuing his high-end journey
within EverQuest (witness his comments in this thread about being close to
beating Uqua) and a simultaneous journey to the high-end in City of Heroes.
His Empathy Defender, Umbriel, is nearing level 30 in that game. If it
wasn't for his committment to continuing in both games, I'm sure he would
have already hit the CoH level cap of 40 (which just got raised to 50 in
this week's update).

His posts on the progress of Umbriel can be found at alt.games.coh, and

different relative levels within their respective gameworlds, so Umbriel's
story is still largely one of discovery and adventure on the journey to the
high-end.

My hat's off to anyone who can devote the kind of energy and quality of play
