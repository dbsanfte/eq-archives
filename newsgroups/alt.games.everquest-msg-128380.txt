I was giving a strange warrior armor type to quest for on the syaran server.
Its called Battlemaster armor, has anyone else been givin this armor to
quest for out of Qeynos. and also there are a couple of ingredints for it
that no one seems to have ever seen. like rat eye, Giant fire beetle brain
and Rabid grizzly hide (not the putride ones) has anyone every seen these
items droped? Non of the websites seem to list them and no one seems to have
seen them.
