Please define the specific skill "creative thinking".  It seems to
me that creative thinking is one of those "I can't describe it but
I know it when I see it" concepts that you can describe an example
of but never really define.  As such it can be learned, sort of,
but not really taught (vs., for example, arithmetic which can be
taught by clear explanation combined with repetitive drill).  Part
of the slipperiness of the concept is that my creative thinking
does not necessarily work the same as yours, which can be different
from somebody else's, etc.

A skillset is not a skill.  And the skills that are useful in
problem solving vary with the problem domain, though pattern
recognition is pretty genericly useful, as is ability to think
abstractly (concrete thinkers show little creativity, in my
experience anyway) which looks to me to be more of an innate
ability than a trainable skill.
