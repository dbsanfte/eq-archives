I usually type out my responses in full, never being one to use one word
when a dozen will do. The only abbreviation/shortening I  feel slightly
guilty about using is "np", but it has become a habit.

I wonder what it will be like when Anarchy Online gets going. Maybe there
will be crowds of people saying how much they hate the fact that people
refuse to say "plz" and "thx", and use the old fashioned way of spelling out
the full words.
