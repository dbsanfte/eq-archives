Gather shadows is NOT invis to undead, it occasionally functions as such,
but is not.

The only way I can see to do this is to go back to the well, invis to undead
and jump down, drag your corpse over to right under the well, then either
die or gate, then come back to the top of the well, target it *without*
falling down, and type /cor to pull it up top.

Otherwise you might nicely /ooc in west commons for a high level to help
you, most of us won't mind.
