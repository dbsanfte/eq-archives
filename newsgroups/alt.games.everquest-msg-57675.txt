Naw, it all comes down to the twinking. [grin]. Seriously, I'm still not
playing anything like the time I put in on my warrior. Sunday I played
for two hours early in the morning and no more. I had a fair session on
Saturday for five hours or so, but I've not been home much to play my
necro in comparison.

I really think everybody advances their fourth or fifth character a
*lot* faster than the first couple. And it *is* because of the very best
twinking a character can get: I don't mean equipment, or money, etc. (My
necro has some stuff from Najena, no INT or any other player made
jewelrey, and only enough money for spells.) No, the very best thing an
EQ character can be twinked with, IMO, is the raw in-game experience of
the person behind the keyboard. Knowing where to go at what level, what
to hunt (though I still have questions) and just some basic but vital
strategy to cut down on the number of times you die, the time you spend
running around looking for mobs, and the time you waste in down time
recovering from disasterous fights. Every class is a new and different
learning experience, but there are some basic, fundamental things about
hunting in EQ that take a long time to sink in for some people with
thick heads like mine.  But once you learn them, and then apply them to
your new characters, the early levels seem to go by pretty fast.
