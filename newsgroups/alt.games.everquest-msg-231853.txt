ok, HO-LY CRAP! I had no idea a simple 'poll', if you will, would turn into
such a soap box debate. I knew it would be interesting tho... :0)

So, based on the theory that an item is worth only the time it took to
obtain it, what then should I sell my High Quality Cougar Skin for?? I did
not loot it, I bought it from another vendor for 20pp...btw all others in
bazaar are between 100pp and 250pp...but I guess the one that's 250 took a
lot more swings of ye ole rusty bastard sword to kill...<grin>
