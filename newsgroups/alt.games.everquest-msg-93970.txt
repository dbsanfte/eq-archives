I keep seeing comments like this ("I ignore /tell and respond to /ooc")
in this newsgroup.  I find this puzzling as it directly contradicts
my experience in-game over the last two and a half years.  In fact,
I have found that a direct /tell, phrased courteously and offering
compensation (usually something specific:  AC buff for SoW, pp and/or
peridots for rez, etc.), is almost always well received, while /ooc
(and /shout) are ignored more often than not.  And I find that /tell
works far better than /say, as the #$&^%@ beggars have pretty well
trained damned near every druid/shaman/enchanter/cleric in the game to
leap to his feet and flee if anybody runs up and stops to say something.
