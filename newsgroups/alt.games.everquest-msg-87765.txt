Well, there's more to do than just sit at the main mob camps.  A
player who isn't into "grinding" can easily gain exp and levels
by soloing the animals in EC, for example until strong enough to
venture into West Commonlands where you can do more of the same.
It is not necessary to compete for the "camps" such as orc 1 and
2 in EC or the derv camp in WC.  If you want to level as fast as
possible then that's what you do, but if you want to explore and
take out targets of opportunity there are many places to go and
things to do.  You just won't level as fast as the grinders,
that's all.

Norrath is a big world and has many places to see.  The places
you can go at lower levels are numerous enough and large enough
to keep you busy until you gain levels enough to venture to the
more advanced zones.

There is much more available in EQ than level grinding.
