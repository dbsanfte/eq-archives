Dark Elves in Qeynos...My faction can't get any better in Qeynos (as long as
you are not talking to a Bard)
Yes you normally need to improve you faction somewhat to get trained, think
apprehesive normally covers it but maybe it's indifferent, whether by quests
or just killing mobs.
Took me from 8th to 10th killing gnolls before Capt Tillin would train me in
Qeynos.
