    I think you're blowing my comment a little out of proportion. I really
don't think I suggested that druids constantly root/rot 6 giants at once.

    But yeah, I *do* see a correlation between "hey no giants around" and
somebody with 6 rooted off the hill. I've never been ware of much more than
about 6 of them active in the zone at any one time, so if somebody had 6
that would suggest to me that the other 14 people in the zone had none.

cheers,
James
