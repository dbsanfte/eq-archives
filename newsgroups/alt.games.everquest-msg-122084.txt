Heh, that would be mighty nice of you, I just thought it'd be fun to
get the newbie gear since I'm still only L15, was hugely annoying to
get the TLC message on about my twelfth Large Field Rat.

Yes, I figure if I really want the stuff I can get all the other bits
eventually, it was the Large Field Rat was the problem, because it's
such a lo level mob (assuming L1 or L2 given how few hp it has).

Sorry, not targetting you or the majority of the multiple account
folks around, that's the problem with speaking too generally, you
never know for sure who you'll insult.  (I'd have two accounts
myself if I had a second box capable of running EQ.)

Thank you, I shall.  And I've messed around a bit with tailoring, so
I'd be happy so exchange some tailored smithing components for any
help.  I was gonna be a smith, but I just couldn't bring myself to
devote all my playtime to hunting cash and practicing smithing before
the skill-up nerf (my main on Tunare is a 177 smith, but it's a
mostly useless skill because he is a half-elf).

I'll not argue that.
