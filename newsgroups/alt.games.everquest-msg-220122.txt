I was right there with him, it was short and to the point, fit
this subthread, pulled in and recycled the concurrent "don't
neuter your dog" subthread, in fact the only thing making it
short of Olympic was that it wasn't to my recollection a direct
quote from "the meaning of life" (and in this case, I'd accept a
douglas adams hijack of the hijack).

I'd have accepted the accolades gracefully and moved on, but then
I'm Picard and you're Samwise.
