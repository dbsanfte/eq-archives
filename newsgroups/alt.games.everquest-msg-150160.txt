Here's what I was thinking

/bash
/cast 7 (yaulp V)

Simple as that.  Mash this hotkey instead of the bash button,
if Yaulp V hasn't cycled nothing happens, if it has, it goes off
too.

Question is, is this better than keeping the actual bash button
and YV icon on their own hotkeys?

The actual bash button greys out when not available, so I can
watch it and keep mashing as fast as possible.

The YV hotkey also greys out when not available.

Worse, YV becomes available a couple tics before the
previous YV wears out.  By setting up to cast the instant
it becomes available, I'm wasting mana.

On the bright side, I save a hotkey slot, its easier to keep
YV on constantly, and there's one less thing to worry about.

Opinions?
