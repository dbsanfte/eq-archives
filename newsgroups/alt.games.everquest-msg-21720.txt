2 words, less than a compete sentence, however I am not sure if this
qualifies as a "syntactic unit," but if it does, it is a phrase.

I wonder why anyone would care about the name Kitty Kat, or whether or not
it is a phrase.  At least it has more roleplay potential than a lot if the
others that were listed in this thread.
