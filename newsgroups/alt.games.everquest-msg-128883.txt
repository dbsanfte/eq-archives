Is your faith so weak that living near (or in the same community) as
someone who practices witchcraft will "poison" it? Can the mere
presence of a pagan, cause you to question your faith?

I think it is funny and sad that most flavors of religion are so
insecure that they feel the need to remove anything or anyone that
doesn't share the same belief. 

All major forms of religion teach tolerance, but practice intolerance.
