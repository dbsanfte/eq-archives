see thread: Ranger lvl 12 vs Will-o-wisp.

Essentially kaev and I took an off topic tangent over his (kaev's) comment
that he feels a player has an obligation to his prospective group members to
shop the bazaar... instead of sticking to items they've quested/earned
directly.

I disagreed.

I think people who are carrying the best items they can have earned are
typically quite competent players, and that compensates for less dps or
whatever else comes from better equipment from the bazaar in most cases. And
more importantly, within my experience these 'rp' types aren't forcing their
playstyle on others, nor even actively seeking to group with players who are
powerleveler-twinks so they really shouldn't impact "his game" at all.

Further, I stipulated that his suggestion that you owe it to your groupmates
to be equipped to certain standards opens a slippery slope whereby your
groupmates will start requiring you be buffed by hi-levelers, and equipped
with hi-level items before they'll let you join. (As evidence of stuff like
this already occuring in isolation, there was an unrelated post by a 25th
cleric stating that he was expected to show up to a group with KEI.)

Kaev then opened his self-explanatory 'rant' about 'rp' players, where he
expresses his frustration with players rejecting self-twinking themsleves
out of the bazaar for various 'rp' reasons.

The not understand/agree with boycotting the bazaar i understand; many
people don't understand or agree with the various rp mentalities in eq.
However, I'm not really sure who's whining... people who choose to boycott
the bazaar are inevitably prepared for the additional hardship they're
voluntarily assuming... and I've never heard them subsequently whine about
it. And I certainly don't think I've been whining...but kaev perceives
otherwise.
