Yeah, it's riskier than root/rot, but it's also more fun.

Those rockhoppers have INSANE regen, once my pet finished a fight at about
5-10 % health, in the 30-45 seconds that it took me to find something else
for him to kill, he got up to about 75-80% health.

Also, the Druid pet-only haste/STR/AC buff has a duration of 8 minutes.  I
never said anything about slowing my target, and as for damage mitigation,
the aforementioned insane regen rate takes care of that, and I now keep
thorns loaded in case of adds.

I did this again last night, I was able to take a Greater Spire Spirit down
with a blue Mature Rockhopper pet (was a bit irritating the one time the
spirit landed fear on Dino).  Also, apparently the Mons Letalis Rockhoppers
are NOT KoS, however they are extremely social.

To clarify;  If you haven't tried this yourself, don't say it doesn't work.
