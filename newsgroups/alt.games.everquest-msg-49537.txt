This is far far less of a restriction on the opportunity to play then
a high end death due to a MOB in DAoC or EQ.  IN DAoC you would lose
exp  and con to the mob but not to the enemy realmer. In EQ you have
the whole CR thing which can take hours.

Yes it is a PVP/RVR game but that doesn't mean the PvE is less
entertaining then in EQ. There is a shortage of high level content and
more dungeons are needed but they will come given time.  PvE in DAoC
is far less downtime intensive then EQ.

True. And if they start bullshitting you will hear it from me. But for
now I am not going to judge them by the same standards I do verant
since they have been open and honest so far.  When that changes so
will the benefit of the doubt.

Ok number one. Mark Jacobs has already stated that post release
enhancements will go in at the 60/40 ratio of Rvr-PvP/PvE-high End
Raid until RvR is finished and then the PvE game will get full
attention.  Second why do you think providing the same content that EQ
does will break their bank? They charge more then EQ does for one
thing. For another the entire dev team is still on the payroll, there
has been no transition to a smaller "live" team. Mythic cannot invoke
the risk versus reward canard because quite frankly a death due to PvP
is far less costly then one due to PvE. That's just the way the game
is.  You lose nothing on deaths to RvR/PvP and if they do choose to
implement loss on death to PvP play it will be on a "Hardcore" server
just as they have already implemented a RP server.

PvP is the ultimate goal of the game but except for minor class
balancing and the addition of more relics and possible frontier
expansion it's done. I guess the best thing would be to see what the
game has done in two months. I do not think the game is perfect and
obviously in any MMORPG there are going to be clusterfucks but so far
I don't see any. And so far mythic has fixed the exploits that have
been revealed.  For example. There was a keep attack scheduled in beta
and someone posted they were going to log on as  defender and then at
a critical moment open the gates to the keep to the enemy,  less then
6 hours before the fight was to start.  By the time the fight had
started there was a server side change that auto locked the gates when
an enemy was in range and that the only ones who could open them while
in "red alert" mode were the NPC guards inside.

It's not just a graphic update. Unlike Verant mythic leased a pre
built well liked graphic engine. The net immerse engine. The current
version is version 3 something. When the expansion comes along
optimization for version 4 will be included and the game will switch
over to ver 4. I don't remember all the benefits but one of them is
that higher concentrations of  avatars per area could be supported
without downgrading framerates. When EQ has an expansion new  lands
are released. I doubt the expansion for Mythic will not have new lands
and dungeons as well.

Can you get into Vasheens Peak without the right keys? Nope. Could
verant remove those keys from the database. yes. Could verant make
those keys wood elf only? Yes. So why is it so hard to believe  that
Mythic will make the home realms un invadable. I'm not saying it won;t
happen I am saying that when it does the methods used will be
countered. So far the only test done was a success with the invaders
failing to get into the home realms.

I'm sorry Dennis but That's just false.  Can people loot your corpse
in EQ? No because its coded not to allow it. Can you Pk in the safe
realm in UO these days?  I don't think so.  This is a hard pvp switch
it's just one that is geographically based instead of character based.
Given that, its in Mythics interest to keep the switch stable and
functioning and they know that.

I guess the only way to find out is to wait and see.

Why don't you accept that premise? I you are "safe" in the US but not
in Afghanistan that is about the same methodology is it not?
Geographic based safeness.  Why is this an unacceptable pk switch
assuming you really are safe in the home realms which I am doing.

He can see the whole game if he wants too. Just on three different
servers. I guess the last answer to that statement is yes at least in
DAoC. If your firmly pro PvE then EQ has more to offer in terms of
dungeons and mobs and raids, for now.  If the thought of getting
instantly zinged back to your last bind point with no loss of exp or
constitution or anything but a little run time (which is less then the
time loss in eq for an equivalent level death) is that annoying then
yes I guess Daoc has less to offer. For me exploring the frontier will
be funner because I know I won't lose anything to death but that I
will be facing the smartest mobs in the world in order tog et the
opportunity to explore.

Viable it certainly is. PvE isn't its primary focus true but PvE is
certainly viable.

I never claimed it was. I also had a lot more problems with EQ in beta
then DAoC. The Interface sucked ass, the quests were mind bogglingly
boring, I couldn't see at night, and I got insta killed a lot.  I like
to kvetch about games its a pastime so undoubtedly I will kvetch about
DAoC too, but there is something to be said for the quality of the
beta, the honesty of the devs, the reliability of the release, and
fact that while DAoC sure doesn't have the newness factor that EQ did
it is fun in its own right with so far none of the easily visible
issues from EQ. I was in EQ beta for like 3 or 4 months and got sylver
to level 8 max. In DAoC I got Silver to level 12 in less then half a
month of playing. That right there means something to me.
