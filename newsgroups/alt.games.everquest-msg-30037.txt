    I understand your point, but:
    That's not exactly a sound analogy, since Ice Comet is a flat out
attack, which has to compete with all of the damage that has already been
done to a MOB.  Where, from what I have now learned, Atone just erases all
of that information, so you then only have to do more damage than the
rightful owner while you are both attacking it.

    Oh, and KSing isn't bannable until you do it a LOT, and it is clear that
you're doing it on purpose... and you're an a-hole about it... to the GM...
and there's a galactic eclipse... during a full moon... on friday the
29th... of February...


(yes, I'm being sarcastic).
