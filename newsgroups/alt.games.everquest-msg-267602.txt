That complicates the equation, but doesn't really change things.  One
of two things would happen:

1. SOE determines that training new people is too time consuming, too
   cost prohibitive, or both, and pulls the plug on EQ1, moving those
   EQ1 resources onto EQ2.

2. SOE determines that training new people isn't too time consuming,
   nor is it too cost prohibitive, and hires more employees.

In the end, it's still *extremely* likely SOE will pull the plug on
EQ1 while it's still profitable.  Anyone who thinks SOE will keep EQ1
around as long as it's still making one cent per year in profit is
being stupid.

I'd be surprised if EQ1 survives 18 more months, 24 at the very, very
most.  I'll check back in 18-24 months to see if I'm wrong.  :)  I
think it's possible they'll pull the plug on EQ1 as early as 12 months
from now.
