And very few are ever going to see the boss mob at all, what's your
point?

Maybe 1% of the EQ population will actually get to kill Vulak.  And
yet, that's the level we're tuning the game for.

Badge of honor?
First off, no epic quest Verant has put together is even remotely
"epic" unless it's epic tedium.

Second, given their track record, the epic armor quest will be solved
and posted on every webboard under the sun.

Third, within a couple of months, every player and their cousin will
have their "epic armor" or at least be working towards it.

Where exactly is the sense of "honor" here?  Or even the uniqueness?

Even looks is a joke.  Druids for the longest time wore the BCP
because they wanted to "look different".  Nevermind that about 80% of
the level 40+ druid was running around in BCP--so much for looking
different.

A real difference is the items from the big mob.

Ask me how many druid epics are on my server?  I honestly have no
clue.  So many druids between level 52 and 60 have it now, I've lost
count.  I don't even remember who had the first.

Ask me how many druid arms from Vulak are on my server?  There's just
one.  I have it.

See my point?

The same can be said of cleric epics and the cleric/shaman shield from
Vulak.  There's probably more than 4 dozen rez sticks on my server.
There's just one shield.

Epic quest anything, unless it's designed to be truely epic (in which
case everyone will be bitching about how it's unfair that every person
by virtue of paying $10/month should be given their epic), is hardly
epic, hardly unique and there's no "badge of honor" to it.
