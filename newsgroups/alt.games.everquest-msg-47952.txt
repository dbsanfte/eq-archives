You are correct biz, or may I call you bubba? <grin>  It doesn't matter
WHERE you make a back-up.  Though, lets say you DID make a back-up at this
guys house, which would be fine.  However, should you leave the files on
his/her computer or hand him the back-up, you are NOW distributing the
files, which is again, against the EULA.

As for any courts would be concerned, the EULA is pretty much a rock.
