The elemental planes aren't capable of supporting large numbers of exp
groups, unless you stuffed quite a few of them into water (most people
hate fighting underwater) and air (everyone hates fighting mobs that
pointlessly split into more mobs), which tend towards desertedness for
good reason.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
