 Ummm.... when you get up in levels and do Planes raids you will need to 
be sitting there a lot longer than 5 hours. More like 24. The last time
we did Plane of Air we were there from friday afternoon til sunday night.
You just can't leave once you get there (rather, you don't really want
to and/or once you DO leave, you can't go back easily).
