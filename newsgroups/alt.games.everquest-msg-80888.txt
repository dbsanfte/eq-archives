As a level 44 Enchanter I just want to add one note. While it may be
unlikely that something may happen the power of being an enchanter comes
with flexability. I may be speaking to soon (Level 4 was a looooooooong time
ago although at that time I was totally n00b myself heh) every single type
of spell an enchanter has can be used very effectively in the proper
settings. just because a spell might only be used once in a great while
doesn't mean you should attempt to get and keep handy.

I personally get all the spells I can. couple that I don't get are simply
never gonna use... aka true north (click click click to death until Sense
heading works... it is such a godsend when it's gets to about 50-75 and
works semi-reliably) dont' think I've ever used Reclaim Energy (Although
those that want to solo with pet and not have pet take all exp can use
this... pain imo to keep tiny daggers tho) etc

Next tash upgrade is at level 20. Upgrade to Mez comes at 16.  Entrall
(Single target Mez) Mesmerisation (AreaMez)
