While this is true, people often make trade skill mules,
that really aren't suited to fighting well.  They tend to
max charisma for prices and int, for skill ups etc. 
They don't necessarily do trade skills to get rich but to
fund other trade skills, before the nerf on fish products,
people would master baking to afford to master smithing and
make fine Plate for their main, or friends, as well as to
sell.
