Actually Sony has said nothing about what they are going to do.  If 
anything.  They are just playing games to avoid fixing their problem.  
What Sony has done is illegal.  Its also illegal for them to say your 
subscription is canceled just because you had to change credit card 
numbers.  They have also constantly outright lied about this entire 
situation.

All they keep saying on their messag forums is that they are 
"investigating" the situation (as if the problem has to be 
"investigated").  And ask anyone in charge, and they pretend they have 
no power to do anything.

My $99 expired the other day.   I had to change credit card numbers 
because someone stole my credit card number that same day.  Extremely 
ironic it happened the very same day I sent an email complaining to Sony 
about what they have done.

Sony/Verant has been like this since day 1, seven years ago.  Never 
caring about the customer, just the money that goes in their own 
pocket.  And yes, I have played this game for 7 years, so I know what 
I'm talking about.

Its very possible I may not sign up again.  A person can only take so 
much of their crap.

There is a big duscussion about this on the  soe official forums. It
is going to be fixed and those who had to pay to 149 dollar ate to
continue play over last weekend will get reimbursed. The 99 dollar
rate is correct, officially.
