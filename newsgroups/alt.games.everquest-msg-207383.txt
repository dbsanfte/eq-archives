EQ historically has severly punished players for exploring dungeons. I
bet every EQ "old-timer" has a tale of losing a corpse by falling into
the well in Befallen, or something similar. Players are taught very
quickly to avoid dungeon zones. It's had to break that kind of early
conditioning, especially when the outdoor zones provide decent rewards
(exp/loot) at a much lower risk.

I would be curious to see them add a "graveyard" to all of the low-mid
level dungeons. Then slowly wean players off of it as they level up
and face the more challenging zones and raid conditions. In other
words condition players to expect to die in a dungeon crawl without a
knee-jerk fear of losing everything. Then save the challengeing CRs
for the higher levels where they have a much better chance (due to
skills/spells/etc) of pulling it off.
