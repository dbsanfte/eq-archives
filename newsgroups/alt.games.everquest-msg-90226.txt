There should be a few more good outdoor hunting zones.  They are great for
pickup groups.

I think they should take rez out of the game.  I mean, "once to 60 the fun
kind of dies a bit to me."  "Maybe just take the [rez] spells out of the
game, and replace them with something else."

Why would you pick on AE?  Rez seems like it's probably a much bigger
problem to you, because any sane person would realize if they don't want the
faster exp (which comes with higher risk, I know from experience) they could
just not get into an AE group.

The first way to achieve departure from the dream group is to try something
different.  Hint, this isn't nearly as big a problem as you want it to be. 
Stop reading peoples' complaints about the unholy warrior/cleric combo and
thinking they're talking about grinding, cause they're not.  The problem is
the *raid* reliance on the warrior/cleric combo.

>This is not a rant I love the game just a few things that I thought

I think your first idea has merit, your second idea is whining, and worse
it's the sort of "My arm hurts when I do this" "then don't do that" whining
that just looks silly.  The "dream group" isn't really much of a problem at
all.  If you don't play a warrior or a cleric, just start a group and don't
invite a warrior or a cleric.  Simple as that.  If you do play a warrior or
a cleric, you're screwed because along with being the end-all raid combo,
they are both heavily reliant upon each other for their usefulness.
