Thanks for the help, guys. :) I actually started out with the cutlass
in my main hand but it seemed like any increases in 1HS and dual wield
were few and far between. Then when I switched to the axe in the main
I got a flurry of increases in both. Could've been a fluke - I'll
switch them back and see what happens.

Need to find me a shaman to group with or get a DEX buff from. ;)

Again, thanks for the help!
