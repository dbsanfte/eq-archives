Hehe... sorry to dissapoint you, but almost all the items are no-drop.
They are rather easy to come by at your level though:

Boots:
- Shadow Silk (Silk Swatch, Shadow Wolf Pelt, Scroll of Gather Shadows,
combined
in a Large Sewing Kit)
- LORE/NO DROP: Scepter of Sorrow (Lower Guk or Mistmoore, you will have to
cast identify
on it, its the Scepter of Sorrow according to identify spell)
- LORE/NO DROP: Skeletal toe, easy, from Giant Skeleton in Rathe Mountains
- NO RENT: Eye of Shadow, drops from shadowed men in Nektulos, easy camp,
single
  pulls at 38plus

Gloves:
- Inky Silk (same as Shadow Silk, + 1 scroll of Gather Shadows)
- LORE/NO DROP: Scepter of Tears (See above, this one is from the other
place...)
- LORE/NO DROP: Skeletal Finger (Rathe Mountains)
- NO RENT: Hand of Shadow (see above)

Robe of Enshroudment:
- Large Shadow Silk (same as Shadow Silk, + 1 Shadow Wolf Pelt this time)
- LORE/NO DROP: Werebat Wing, from the Estate of Unrest - easy!
- LORE/NO DROP: Globe of Shadow, from the Nokta Shaman in Upper Guk,
    not so easy at my level, but you should be fine - your pet can clear
everything there
- NO RENT: Mask of Shadow (see above)

... That's all...

Kinda easy and worth it!
