I've never yet met a RP'er that was "condesending (sic) and arrogant".  They
are invariably nice people that like to help people.  There are some that I
would not call RP'ers that just use the environment to spout racial abuses.
You might try to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they have
confused the hero role and the ignorant peon role.  But I think rather that
they are just asses.
