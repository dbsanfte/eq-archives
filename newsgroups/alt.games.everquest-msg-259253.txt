He shouldn't do any more damage with the things; their damage rating is 
10, which means any pet which does more than 20 points as his max hit 
isn't going to do any more with these weapons.

Damage by a pet is best of his own damage or 2x weapon damage.

For most classes, a weapon with damage of 10 is useless for increasing 
damage by the time they are level 16 or so, I'm not sure of the 
specifics for a beastlord pet.

Delay of a pet is unaffected by weapon (unless its a haste weapon, which 
is unlikely)

There is in some classes a period where the pet will dual weild if you 
give it two one handers, but not without; during this period giving pet 
any two weapons will increase damage output overall by increasing the 
number of swings taken... two rusty daggers will do that job as well as 
two 50/50 one handers if you could find such things.  Most pets, this 
period lasts a dozen levels or so and then they dual weild without 
needing the hint; shaman pets are one exception to this, they -always- 
benefit from a pair of broken bottles or what have you.  I'm guessing 
Beastlords are not an exception.

How, then, do summoned weapons increase damage output from your pet at 
high levels?  What he -is- supposed to do is proc with them, thus doing 
extra damage that way.  They also boost his HP, so he lives longer...

Then you also get him a haste mask (muzzle of Mardu) which will make him 
swing more often... still not for more damage, just more often

And you can round that out with a HP belt which includes dex to make him 
proc more often (both the weapon procs and his own beastlord buff 
procs), plus armor to increase his damage mitigation by raising his AC; 
mages can summon plate armor for every "visible" spot on your body, 
which is fun for handing out to newbie paladins (its red) but useful for 
AC buffing pets.

Usually each of the above is available for 5pp or so in the bazaar any 
time day or night, exception being the armor, which would be 
inconvenient to sell like that, so is generally only available directly 
from a mage in POK, where you can probably also find the rest of the kit.

Is it necessary?  No.  Does it help?  Yep, it seems a full kit is good 
for about a 15% boost in your pet's usefulness (combining added damage, 
added Hp, added procs, added mitigation); much more if it doesn't 
naturally dual weild, astonishingly more if you are under level 20.
