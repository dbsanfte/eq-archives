USB ethernet??

What is that?

A USB cable modem is fine for EQ.  I run a network of 4pcs on a 600kb
connection, going through a router, 2 in EQ most of time, the other two
mainly for browsing.

Never get any lag, ADSL is also USB, and is not laggy.

Its more likely a fault in your area, or a fault with your OS installation.
