Magic casting skills are easily raised without any risk at all, just sit 
somewhere safe and cast your lowest mana cost spell in each category 
again and again and again, the skills will go up just as fast (faster, 
really, since you are casting cheapest spell regardless of how useful it 
is) than they would casting in combat.  This is a little tedious, but 
you can read the newspaper or something while you do it, as there's no 
risk involved at all.

Therefore, there's no reason to put anything but one point in each 
casting skill, plus one point in channelling and meditation (I don't 
think you can get meditation till 12 or something as a BL).  Meditation 
will go up whenever you are sitting down and don't have full mana, so 
its also not worth spending more than a point on.

All weapon types are equal in terms of how much damage they do (unless 
you are a rogue), whats interesting is your skill and the actual stats 
of the weapons in question.  I don't know enough about beastlords to say 
which skills their best and most easily aquired weapons fall under at 
low levels, I think at the high end most end up relying on two handed blunt.

A good rule for most melee, though, is to get all your weapons skills 
maxed out by the time you hit 20, and keep them all there, so when you 
run across an excellent weapon you don't have to worry about which skill 
it uses.

I did play a beastlord up into the low 20s, and found that H2H skill 
went up far more slowly than any other skill for some reason; even with 
a faster better weapon there than any of my other weapons it was very 
reluctant to go up.  Could have just been bad luck on my part, could 
have been something coded wrong thats since been fixed, I'm really not 
an expert by any means.  But -if- I'm right, then you'd be best off 
spending most of your training points on H2H, and using normal melee 
time to raise the rest of the skills; just be sure you have at least one 
point available when each new skill comes around (kick, dual weild, 
double attack, etc.)
