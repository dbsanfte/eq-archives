I've got a huge /played time as well, but I can't say that I
spent all that time "in" Everquest -- I often leave my character logged
in for long periods while *I* am doing something else, like cleaning
house or working on my laptop, then I check back in every once
in a while to see if that rare spawn is up yet, or if the PH or
mob I'm camping for a long-camp item is up (kill, repeat).

So the question is, how much of that 200 days did you spend afk?
