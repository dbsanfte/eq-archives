Its a great idea.
The only problem I had with upgrading to XP was that my Soundblaster stopped
playing the game music (no biggie), but even that has been fixed as of about

Apart from that, XP is stable, easily optimisable (is that a word?!?!) OS,
and you wont regret upgrading, unless you live with a Linux or Apple zealot,
who will make your life hell ;)
