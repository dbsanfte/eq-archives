As I mentioned in another thread, I've been trying without success to
start my cleric epic; item one is a Lord Bergurgle in Lake Rathe.

I"m under the impression that he spawns in the same spot as the tainted
DW goblin needed for the druid epic, and I've done the spawn with three
seperate druids, each time for several hours, twice just till the
tainted spawned, the third time he spawned early but we stuck at it for
a while until -another- tainted/corrupted spawn came along, which we
ended up giving to a randomly selected druid from a /who all druid check
(hey, a reward for not being anon!)

So the question is, are we killing the wrong goblins off that tower? Or
is the Lord more rare than the tainted/corrupted?  Or am I just one
unlucky cleric?

Since I was in a very small guild that had no chance of getting me most
of the harder epic pieces, I didn't much care, but having recently
switched to a large high level guild, it looks like something I should
start trying seriously.

As a side question, the walkthru I have has very little by way of
detail, can you reccomend any others?  And I don't see many things on
this list that I can do out of order... looks like there is another guy
in LRathe I can swat now to get it out of the way, anything else?
