Two home runs, although to put a tv and a cable modem on the one into
your computer room then splits it.  If the signal is an issue, you may
want to have the 2 port splitter swapped for a 3 port and have 2 lines
running into the computer room.

Hey, I didn't say it was hard, just that we install it if you want to
buy it from us =)  Remember thou, you need a power supply for the
amplifier, usually done with a loop using a cable outlet inside the
house.

>OK, I have to go get a digital box anyway, I'll see what RR sells and go out
>& buy one for myself to avoid the installation cost.  Thanks!

Heh, no problem.  And if for some reason, you do have a problem, my
division only charges $25 to hook it up for you =)
