Yes anyone can do it. You could have the enchanter do it or it multi
it for the cleric it does not matter since its droppable. 

My wood elf druid, after having my cleric log out righ tthere with the
proper enchanted bars, turned in the parts for the caddecus then my
cleric logged on after it logged and turned in the bars and got the
caddecus (since that item is no drop)

I am not sure if it requires your faction to be indiff or above, but
easy way is to talk to the npc and see if it gives the quest. The only
way your sol ro temple faction would be low would be if you took hits
on it (such as killing the sol ro temple faction invis guy in the
graveyard in MM)
