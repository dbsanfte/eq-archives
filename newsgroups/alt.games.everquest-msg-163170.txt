Blacksmithing will use the highest of Wis, Str or Int. You may find your
SK is by far your best choice for a smith, as Str buffs and gear are pretty 
easy to find cheaply.

That said, getting smithing will cost you a lot of money. No, I said it will
cost you a LOT of money. Unless you are willing to buy thousands of
pp from ebay, or you have a wealthy character of a significantly higher
level than your SK, try to buy it from an established smith. If you cant
afford to buy it from the smith you will likely find you  cant afford to get 
your skill high enough to make it yourself.

I'm not a smith, so my advice is largely based on hearsay and my experience
of other trade skills, but for significantly 'profitable' tradeskilling you 
generally need seed money in the order of 10's of thousands of PP and
the patience to go hunt a lot of components yourself - the less patience you
have, the more money you need.
