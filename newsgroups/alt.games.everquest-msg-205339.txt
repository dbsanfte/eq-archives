On many other servers, Bristlebane and FV to name two, it doesn't, the Centi
LS still holding it's price.
Personally I wouldn't have made that trade...Sentry armour normally sells
well for 2 -300 easily. Centi SS doesn't fetch much (pricier on FV but then
most things are) but still isn't a bad weapon and the lammy is normally
1900 - 2100 on Bristlebane, with a Centi LS for 2500 average.

I suppose the Centi is Less aggro for a Ranger and makes a decent off-hand
weapon but I would never go out of my way to get one.

I assume the Centi SS was spare and you didn't just get rid of you main and
secondary weapons for the Longsword?
