    Really?  Regardless of age?
    You normally seem like you at least have a head on your shoulders, so I
think you're just generalizing, here.
    I am a STRONG believer in personal responsibility, but I would suggest
that there are some things for which, at some ages, a child ought not be
held totally responsible.
    Where the kid doesn't have the capacity to get himself out of the
situation, it is, in many ways, the duty of the parent to offer some aid.
Otherwise, why don't we just kick kids out of the house after their born?
Hell, they entered the world... they should deal with it.

    Yeah, I do see how it might seem that way, and I would agree with you,
if it went down like that.
    However, these kids were ambushed by a druid who was, basically, a prick
who did a /petitionable thing to a pack of very low level characters.  If it
happened to my character in his youth, having no recourse myself, I
absolutely would have /telled (/told just doesn't seem like the past tense
of that command) my higher level friends about him.
    Although, being better able to communicate via a keyboard than a child,
I would have talked directly to the druid myself.  For a child who (at that
time) had difficulty using a keyboard to communicate, I think you'd agree
that it is totally acceptable for his father to log on to have a chat with
assholedruid.

    The 4 year old was a joke, but he would win the title by several years.

    You wouldn't believe how much he's learned playing a game that requires
him to read (and fast) in order to play.

    Community is having people to rely on when you can't handle it all
yourself... and being there for others.  My friend needs a ride home from
the train station because his wife has the car and his 4 and 2 year old sons
are in bed, he calls me.  I need an extra pair of hands to run a few
thousand feet of CAT-5, I call him.
    I would suggest that that is hardly a blight on society... quite the
opposite, infact.
    Having a child go to his dad to ask for some help when someone has done
something to him... I'd suggest that that's hardly a bad thing.  I might
even suggest that it is better than what an inexperienced mind might try to
come up with on its own.
