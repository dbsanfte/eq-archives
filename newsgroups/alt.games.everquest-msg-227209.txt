At 52 I don't think you'll see many shaman running around with Malo.  If 
you do, you've got to be thinking "dude that spell cost 40Kpp put it in 
the bank till you are at least CLOSE to 60"

Malosi, now, is another story.  However, casting Malosi on incoming 
never once got me aggro, and didnt' slow down casting slow all that much 
in most cases, since I'd want to wait a couple heartbeats for aggro to 
be established anyway.

Malosi being almost zero aggro, its not as though splitting up the duty 
prevents the second shaman from being POP roadkill on resisted slow, either.

Bringing a second shaman along just to remove the malo-x pressure from 
the first one would be like bringing a second ranger and having him 
snare but not do any DPS.

And of course my favorite, if you want someone besides the shaman to 
cast Malosi, bring a freaking mage!
