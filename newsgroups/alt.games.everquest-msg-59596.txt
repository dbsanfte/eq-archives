Sorry, I know he's only level 24, but do you realize how heavy higher
level druid armor really is?  It's not until Velious that VI pulled
their heads outta their asses about the weight of druid armor.

Verm armor from Fear is the heaviest class specific armor.  Go check
the weight of each piece, the +STR they provide and compare it to any
other Fear/Hate armor.  Even Indocite is lighter weight than Verm
overall.

And the ES stuff also weighed a ton.
Only the Velious stuff was reasonable in terms of weight.  It wasn't
until I got rid of all my ES/Verm stuff in favor of Kael quest armor
that I stopped worrying about encumberence.
