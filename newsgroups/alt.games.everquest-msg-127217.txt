No, I wholeheartedly agree, in a balanced group playing chorus during
fights is a mistake, you will almost certainly get more damage production
from hasting your melees and more damage reduction from slowing the
mob.  However, assuming you were twisting in Chorus as your third
song (seems that way from your post) then you thought -some- mana
regen was in order... so substitute Cantata of Soothing or (much better)
Cantata of Replentishment (55, so it will be a while yet) when you feel
like doing that.  You'll get twice the effect (with Replentishment five times
the effect) and your casters will see the icon they are looking for.

If you want to combine cantata and chorus during downtime, its
chorus, cantata (watch for two tics of Clears) repeat
or better still
amplify cantata chorus chorus cantata chorus chorus cantata chorus
which maximizes your mana output while keeping the HP regen up,
or even more mana optimal
amplify chorus (wait till amp fades) repeat
this last also almost provides you a rest.

Then again, a sensible bard will probably just hit either chorus or
cantata between pulls and give himself a -real- rest!
