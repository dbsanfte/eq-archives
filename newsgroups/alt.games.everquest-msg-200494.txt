They say the zem is high in this zone. I've never seen it. Maybe it's 
because the spawn rate is so excrutiatingly slow, or the fact that it is so 
terribly overcrowded most of the time. The few times I've spent any time 
there were some of the most boring and inefficient xp-producing EQ 
experiences I can remember.

If you do go, however, clerics are usually a sought-after class there.
