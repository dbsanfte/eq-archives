Damned near impossible for a single players characters too, unless you
just have unlimited time and patience (and plat). Better as a group
effort if you don't want to trade/buy gifts. 

When this quest was announced, our guild got volunteers (who already had
some level of skill in each area) to grandmaster all the skills. Those
who were not doing a skill mastery but wanted earrings were assigned to
the hunting and foraging teams to get all of the non vendor purchasable
supplies. Guild bank money was dispursed to lay off some of the
horrendous cost of skilling up some of these specialties.

This week we got the first dozen produced. I got mine last night.

(I had fishing... possibly the easiest of any of them, so I felt pretty
lucky. Though that's still one damned expensive fishing rod to make.)
