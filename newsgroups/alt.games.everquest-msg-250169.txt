I've been reading over this and seeing both sides. I had a rotten experience
when kei was changed to not be able to affect low levels and was hoping to
get flowing thought items to compensate. Instead, they were being sold for
american currency, which australian dollars weren't buying much at all. I
really wasn't happy about it and saw the system as being ripe for abuse,
even criminal involvement. After all, if a group is farming some mobs
desired by everyone, they can establish a monopoly and force the price up.
You complain to CS, who act only to say what they don't see, they can't do
anything about (great police force that would make!) It might well turn out
that the equivalent of a sweat shop is being run, with workers in india
gaming hour after hour to grind out flawless rockhopper pelts, or ornate
leather moulds, or whatever, for poor wages. Since EQ has anonymity, can
Sony trace who actually is responsible for abuse by a toon?

I think the major problem with this discussion is that the model was not
presented. I think the banking model sounds great. I don't know if the banks
would accept foreign nationals and I can see ID might be an issue (remember,
there's a lot of people living outside america without passports or drivers
licenses or whatever that an american bank might require). I also wonder
about tax; Australian Govt demands a cut of all financial transactions and
might get upset at Australian players trading without coughing up their
piece of the pie.

Here's an idea: try it on a server. If it doesn't work, get rid of it. Most
of the things i want aren't droppable anyway, except for the ornate leather
molds, which really shouldn't be. Go the bank route, but keep in mind the
international database. Realise if there's a way for terrorists to use this
to their advantage, they will. They are smart and don't need much cash to
accomplish 'results'.

The fact is, a black market exists. People get ripped off on it too. Why not
experiment with a regulated version with security and accountability built
in at the ground level? I suspect that Sony hasn't thought about the issues
we have raised, and it just might take the best ideas and try them if we
present the argument in a reasoned form.
