To me anyway, the original models look better because of the talent of
the modeller, who did, IMO, an amazing job with the tiny number of polys
he was able to use. The newer models on the other hand have very odd
proportions, legs too long for the body and other proportional errors
that make them unappealing to me. 

To use a horse I'm currently using a borrowed Amulet of Necropotence for
skele form, which allows me to get away with only the new horse, elemental
and skeleton models. When I have to give it back I'll go back to using
my Wood Elf crown, which allows me to only have male WE's turned on, and
has the added benefit of using only 1 shrink to get small on raids.
