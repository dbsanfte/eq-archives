Hell, even for non-newbies, this is a nice change.  I've long
gotten beyond the point where I need Spider(ling) Silks, *or*
want to bother with placing newly found silks into a tailoring
kit, combining, and then tossing the resulting threads/swatches
on a stack every time I loot something that drops silks.

However now that silks stack, I don't mind taking the
minimal amount of time it takes to right-click-loot the
silks, then later pass them along to a guildmate or other
player who wants to work on their tailoring.

Before, it was just too much of a busy-work pain to bother with.
