Well, I do have Conjuration as my specialization, I tried Sun Vortex and 
  Firebolt of Tallon out extensively last night in a WOS group.

I could chain either one for a while (me and another mage were playing 
"see who can get summoned most), and Firebolts definately took down my 
mana pool faster.  They also did more damage.

With KEI on, I could chain Vortex easily, the short pause between pulls 
was more than enough to catch up.  Chaining Firebolts, though, I'd still 
gradually drop lower and lower.

Without KEI (15 FT, on mount, with my XPG on, thats still 44 mana per 
tic) I could keep Vortex going for a while, dropping gradually and 
supplementing with mod rod, or by taking it easy every few mobs.  On the 
other hand, Firebolts would seriously deplete my mana pool

What I don't have is a good damage parse, but I can say that pretty much 
the only way I got summoned was chaining firebolts, and getting lucky on 
the damage bonus off of them.  Three 2500damage nukes in a row was 
pretty much a lock, anything less than that, well, try again.  And thats 
with BOR and the summoned cast speed focus item; its hard to get aggro 
off a paladin and SK team!
