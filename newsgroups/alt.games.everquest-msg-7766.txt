Hey, C-rat ciggies were great.  15 a day in my rations.

As to WWII pilots on speed, it's not unlikely.  Hell, up to the 60's a
prescription for speed was not hard to get for very trivial reasons.

Also, our recent military history shows us that the government isn't adverse to
using drugs to aid military personnel.  In Vietnam the Special Forces used
speed for lurps, in Desert Storm the pilots were on speed, and a buddy who was
in the Army on the Korean dmz was in a unit that was given speed by a medic
when they had to stay in their foxholes for 24 hours.

I'm using the term "speed" in a wide sense to include various substances like
crystal meth, crank, and other forms of amphetimines (sp?).


-Well, God was my co-pilot....but we crashed into a mountain and I had to eat
Him.
