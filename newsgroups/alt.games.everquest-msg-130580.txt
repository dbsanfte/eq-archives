Again, examples??

I condemn ALL acts of terrorism, no matter WHO commits them..

However, this particular discussion is about the Palestinian terrorism
and whether it is justified or not.

If you would like to open up another debate on someone ELSE's
terrorism, I am all for it..

But it will be a very short debate, for if you DO indeed have other
acts of terrorism, then I will condemn them equally...

However, what I have seen to date is more aptly Human Rights abuses
and NOT terrorism..

I have yet to see an example of Israeli terrorism. If I do, I can
promise you I will condemn it as vocally as I do ANY form of
terrorism..

I am at a loss to explain the relevance of this.

Are you saying that the US committed terrorism by falsely arresting
them??

Do you even understand the definition of terrorism??
