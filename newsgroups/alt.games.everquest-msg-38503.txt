I am playing a level four bard right now and I am getting a bit board 
just running around the front of Qeynos killing gnoll pups and decaying 
skeletons.  I have tried grouping with people of similar level but all 
they do is run around killing every rat or  snake in sight and do not 
want to  do any adventuring or go on any quests outside of the front of 
the city.  Is it too dangerous to go out at fourth level (with a group) 
and when is it safe to start?

Another question I have is whether anyone uses the message boards that 
are posted in the Inns around Norrath anymore?  also is there anyone 
left out there roleplaying?  I grouped up with another chap the other 
day and he didn't speak one bit except to talk about leveling up and 
other out of character stuff.  It would have been cool if that was the 
way he was playing his character but he was a bard as well.  Bards are 
supposed to talk.
