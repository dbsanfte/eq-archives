I suggest staying off the gaming sites and turn off auction.  Figure out the
quests yourself and run them.  Just because someone else has done them
doesn't mean you can't figure them out for yourself.

If you are following the leveling / zone formulas, it's YOUR fault.  It's
only a race if you participate.  If you don't want it to be a gear / lvl /
plat race, don't let it.  If you allow it to be, then you are the problem,
not the game or the other players.

Instead of doing zone1 at level 1-n, and zone2 at level n+1 - n+6, go to
different zones than the norm.  Yeah, you may not get the best EXP, but if
your are worried about that, then, once again, you are CHOOSING to make it a
lvl race and you are to blame.

The best times I have are when I go check out a new zone or play with a
quest I haven't done before.

This Pyzjn ( sp? ) gal has me intrigued.  I'm going to mess with her this
weekend, I think.  I -may- get a GBS, but if I don't, I don't care.  No
matter what, I -will- learn more about Qeynos Hills and I'll probably make
friends by keeping all the young casters near the BB entrance breezed, etc.

Hell, I've raised 4 characters in EC through levels 8-12 or so, and just
last night I hade a face-to-face with Lord Shin Ree ( something like that ).
It was more like a Back-to-face, though.  I pulled the Orc on the hill with
my bow and dragged him east for 2 shots then jumped into him with Melee.  2
seconds later, I'm getting hammered by Lord S.R.  I'd never heard of him and
from the damage he gave out, I wasn't going to survive.  I started the run
to WC and pulled up Allakhazam to see who he was ( another computer, not
minimizing EQ ).  I thought he was a new Mob, but he isn't - I had just
never encountered him before.  I had figured I'd seen every Mob in EC, but I
learned differently last night.

-That's- what I like.  Learning new things.  I lost my lvl 13 and duel-wield
when LSR and his buddies from Orc 1 nailed me, but I didn't care: I learned
something new.
