Recently I've experienced some strange lag. Sometimes without warning
both pings and packet-loss raise and stay at near LD (and I act as LD
but doesn't display as such), but if I say anything (in any way: /say,
/gsay, /tell) I catch up and lag resumes normal level.

After a /say that 'clears' lag it's completely random when strange lag
returns. Can be minutes, hours or seconds :(

I can play for hours and hours without seing it, in fact I've played 6
month before I first saw it...

Needless to say it's annoying. I've met a few others with the same
problem, but no one with a solution.

Changed DataPacket.txt (or whatever) in the EQ-folder from 5.0 to both
7.0 and 15.0 without much improvement.
