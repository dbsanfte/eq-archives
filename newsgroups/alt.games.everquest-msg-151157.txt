Question would be, do GM's have like a reverse quota?  Only allowed to ban X
Accounts in any given period?  I could see Verant getting paranoid about a
GM going ape shit and banning a ton of people and them losing customers (god
forbid).  Of course I wonder if they would even begin to see that bad
players can make them lose customers quicker by having newbies encounter
them (like in this situation) and not want to play past the free month.
Anyway, just rambling my own thoughts here.  Going away now.
