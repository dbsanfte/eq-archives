Ah, but you didn't mention the other 8.  And they may not
have been on when he listed.

I'll admit that most of my arguements in favor of this plan
work better with rarer items with less well known prices.

Still, I've made about 8kpp over the past week or so, buying
copies of Aego at under 500pp and selling at 2kpp.  I've
listed them at 2kpp even though there are others listing at
1Kpp while I'm setting up.  And yet when I log on in the
morning, every day or two I find I've sold another copy
at MY price.

It also occurs to me that he may have slipped and put
7000 pp when he meant a more reasonable (but still
higher than his competition) 700pp.  This would
make him clumsy but not necessarily an idiot.
