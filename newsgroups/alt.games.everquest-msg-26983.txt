Not heard of Fires of Heaven as a Quake3 clan. I do remember a couple of
members of an FOH being knocked out of the CPL qualifiers by UNR-Luke but I
am not sure if that is them or they just share the same acronym. I take it
Fires of Heaven are a US Q3 clan I think these were Euro's.

As for Quake players being dicks in EQ, no, the ones that are generally also
considered dicks in Quake3 it's not the game it is the person playing it.
