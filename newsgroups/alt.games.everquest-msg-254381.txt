OK, so I'm aware that sometime this spring there was a radical change to 
hp regen, and I know vaguely how it works, but I'd like to see some details.

Here's how I think it works:

Standing you get your normal hp regen, based on race and level, added to 
which are any HP regen items, buffs. AAs.  I already don't know exactly 
what the race and level specific details are, is there a chart 
somewhere?  I know that trolls and iksar get more, and I've heard that 
their improved rate scales up as they level up to some extent.

Sitting, you get a higher normal regen rate, added to which are the same 
items and buffs, so while your +2 hp per tic regen item might double 
your standing hp regen, it might only be improving your sitting regen by 
a third.  Don't know precise rates for this either.

Then comes the changes; apparantly the longer you sit, the higher your 
hp regen rate goes.  How exactly does that work, in terms of race and 
level, are there fixed amounts?  Or does your entire regen rate 
including items et al get increased proportionally?

Take as an example my 30 berserker.  Recently I killed a mammoth, had 
80% of my hp left at the end.  I sat down, put on Focussed Will, and sat 
for one minute (the duration of the will), then stood back up, hp bar 
now at 90%.  I didn't look at precise numbers, but I have around 1000 
hp, so that means I got 100 hp back during that minute.  Focussed Will 
should account for 30 of that, which means I got 70hp back from sitting 
down for a minute.  This would be slightly over 10 hp per tic, which 
seems pretty high for sitting hp regen on a barbarian.

If I sat back down for another minute with focussed will on (which would 
be impossible of course) then I'd expect to get the same hp regen.

But what if I hadn't stood up, but remained seated?  Would the ramping 
up have put me at 100 in a second minute even though FW had worn off? 
Or would it be even faster than that?

Suppose I had 10% hp remaining; how long would it take, sitting the 
whole while, to get to full, assuming FW for the first minute then off?

How long would it take if I stood up every minute, just to see whats 
going on?

I have bind wounds skill and can now bind wounds to 70% instead of the 
previous 50%, and further can bind while sitting.  If I start at 60%, 
bind to 70%, then remain sitting how long will the remaining 30% take to 
regen?  What if I started at 10%, bound while sitting to 70%, then 
remained sitting, how much faster would that be?

I realize I can experiment with this and check my logs and watch the hp 
totals in inventory... but right now the servers are down, and I'm 
mostly just wondering if the details are already out there somewhere.
