Doubtful. They stopped it so nobody would do what we did (*/em smirks evilly)
and use a wizard to bind himself in the meat shop in Thurg, mem the Fey Gate
spell, and run back and forth doing the shark meat quest with the NPC up near
the emerald warriors guild.  They "broke" him for some time until they
removed the shark meat from the vendor. He was either not there, or was there
and had a " ! " in front of his name and would not respond to hails and do
the quest.
  Of course, (insert second evil grin here) I have several alts in that city
right now with bank vaults full of backpacks stuffed with shark meat.
  He he he he.
(I also have a max charisma high elf enchanter who's already level 8 or 9 and
has never fought a battle nor cast a spell.  Not that I plan on adventuring
that pathetic excuse for a character. It's just my shopping mule. You ever
see what they charge Trolls for rubies??????/ Yeeesh!)
