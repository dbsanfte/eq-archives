   None of any importance.  /ducks

   Ok, that was just a joke, before anyone goes rabid on me.  And as far as I
can remember, folks describing classes and races in EQ have always used pronouns
pretty much at random.  I suppose this is so that when I joined up and started
reading such things, I wouldn't think "Geez, the guide book describes mages as
males along as all the rest!  They must only want guys to play!"

     Of course, if they really wanted to make real females feel welcome to the
game, they wouldn't have forced all of us who choose humanoid forms to have
eye-popping, gravity defying attributes.  It was particularity bad under the old
models.  For example, Dark elves born were in red bikinis, forced to run around
with their ass cheeks out if they wore anything other than a robe.   Half elves
in leather had that demure "yellow thong panties" look that so many of us real
life woman sport in our day to day activities.   It's still bad to an extent. 
Female barbs look like they should be having too much lower back pain from
hauling humongous jugs to actually swing a sword.  And the leather partial laced
up tube top they where when they are born is just way over the top.

    I'm hoping things are done a bit better in EQII.  I, and several other
women, have asked to not be forced to wear metal bikinis and the like in the
various forum boards where the devs have asked for general input from the
community.  With luck they will notice that real woman do play games like this,
not just horny 14 year old virgin males.
