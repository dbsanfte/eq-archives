Its actually aggro earned healing/damage or something that determines
kills in a way. Aggro earned happens to be partially damage or other
stuff like healing. So he might get the kill or he might not, more
than likely you'd melee the thing for 450 or so and think you meleed
it for 800 and he nuked for 1200 and got the kill.

For instance I was once in a group in hate with one tank and like 4
other druids. The tank was doing minimal damage compared to groups of
other tanks which had clerics and such. What happened was that one of
the druids in the group got aggro from healing the tank (with our
chloroblast and superior heal heals) Then two or three other druids
got aggro while healing that druid, then all the druids were
exchanging aggro while healing each other rapidly. None of us died and
our group got the xp for the kill while we certainly did not do the
most melee or nuke damage of any group there, we just got the largest
damage/healing aggro for the most extended period of time.
