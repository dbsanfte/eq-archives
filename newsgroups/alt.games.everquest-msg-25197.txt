I'm talking about extending the Warren loot rules to other zones, not
specifically about the Warrens themselves.

And I'll give you hypothetical example though, the new Runnyeye.  The
Black Alloy Medallion.  6AC 5Wis 5Int.  Only thing equitable to this
some relatively difficult drops in Velious.  Now if Verant were to put
an item like this in one of the new zones AND made it no drop, I would
have a HUGE problem with this.

And yes, I know that the BAM isn't no drop.  It's a hypothetical
situation, but it does point out that sometimes they do put good items
in low end dungeons.  As long as they make it so I can get the items I
want, even if it's only through trade, I'll be a bit more happy about
it.  Still, generally speaking though, I do dislike the Warren's loot
rules.  It does feel like my druid is being penalized for being over 2
years old.
