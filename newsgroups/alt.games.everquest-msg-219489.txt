Yikes, an idealist. =)

You are aware, of course, that your elected representatives are not 
exactly the cream of the crop, aren't you? You are aware that their 
actual capacity to represent the people is tainted by sigs and corporate 
lobbying, personal avarice and ego, not to mention regular cases of 
plain old incompetence.

I'd vastly prefer the current system of just letting the parents decide 
for themselves whether or not to reproduce. If someones gonna screw up 
anyways I'd rather let it happen on a case by case basis vs letting it 
become a bureacratized entrenched impersonal and costly system of 
screwing up.

Especially when the alternative you've presented me with is laying the 
decision at the feet of your elected (well sort-of-elected) Dubya 
Bush... Hell... I'd even call *that* irresonsible =)
