Since a recent raid where our guild did not utilize this pet pulling
strategie we have an internal discussion whether this is an exploit or
just a feature of everquest.
When I say pet pull I mean the situation where you pull a single mob out
of a crowd of social mobs with a green pet and don't get the social mobs
aggroed.
In my opinion this is an exploit of the faction the pets are on. But
there are others who disagree. They say SoE must have known this a long
time and did not do anything against it. So it isn't an exploit but a
feature.
Right now I'm pretty unsure. Some say it doesn't even have to do with
the faction.
May be you have some ideas about this?


Hagen
