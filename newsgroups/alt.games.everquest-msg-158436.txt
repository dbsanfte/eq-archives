Take a pill, man.  Just because someone isn't a diehard Verant-o-phile,
doesn't mean they're in the "verant suxxors, I'm going to (insert new doomed
MMORPG here), it's going to roxxor" camp.  Some people like to look at what
else is out there.  I went to check out DAoC when it came out.  Didn't
cancel my EQ account, didn't have any illusions of leaving EQ, I just wanted
to see what DAoC was about.  It's a game, not a marrige.
