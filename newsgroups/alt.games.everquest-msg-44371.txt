    There's also the fact that every once in a while you get to watch
someone battle the Priest of Discord.  Usually this is some bored person who
wants to see how many corpses they can pile up about it, but once in a while
someone makes a real go of it.  I saw a guild attacking the one in Rivervale
one night on Rodcet Nife -- apparently (not positive of the facts here)
someone in the guild had given the PoD some valuable equipment and they were
trying to kill him to loot it back. All I can say is that I was damned
impressed at how hard the SOB is to kill...at least with the gear he had on
him.

    I have seen it done, but only by the guards in Greater Faydark.
Apparently they will attack him if he is fighting someone they're friendly
to.  The trick is getting him within their notoriously tiny aggro range.

    (Corrections welcomed, not an expert on PoD combat by any means...like
most people, I just use him as a landmark..)
