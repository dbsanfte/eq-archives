It works for Monual with his human cultural, but as an uncouth Vah Shir smith
without any culture to speak of I don't see the great money making potential.

Acrylia needs windstones, a bitch to farm and expensive to buy, and doesn't
sell for all that much. Tae Ew seems nice, but I don't know how much the
stuff drops in CT, and people don't go there much so you can't buy the stuff
in bazaar.

I'm still only at 182 skill, 209 modified with my Hammer of the Ironfrost,
as I'm avoiding to buy stuff in the bazaar as much as I can and depend on
vendor diving for my leather paddings. It has cost me less than 3k to get'
there though.
