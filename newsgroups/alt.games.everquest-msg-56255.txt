At very low levels, its a little crazy to put twink gear on; its really quite
easy to lose your body and not get back to it for half an hour, whereupon
everything rots. So Twinking in a serious way usually waits for level 6...
or about two hours of play if you are buffed up, or using quest items
to speed level.

From a cost effective viewpoint, the magic point at which WIS gear
becomes better than MANA gear is 25 or so.  At this point, each
point of WIS (or INT if thats the case) is the equivalent of about
5 points of mana, and WIS gear starts to cost less per mana point
than mana gear.

This is true right up to 200 WIS, at which point mana gear suddenly
becomes a better buy, since you are getting one mana per wis
or one mana per mana... and mana gear tends to run about five times
cheaper per point

Look at it another way; if your base WIS is 100, at level one you
get 22 mana according to that formula.  Put on 100 points of WIS
gear, and you get all of 42 mana.  Put on 500 points of mana
gear (about the same cost) and you get 522 mana.

Now level up to 25.  Baseline is 550 mana, with 200 wis you have
1050 mana, or with that 500 gear you -still- have 1050 mana.

How about level 50?  Baseline 1100, 200 wis 2100, 500 mana gear
you have only 1600 mana.

As an aside to all this, mana or wis gear isn't nearly as important as
you might think.  It will do nothing to alter your most important
stat, which is Kills per Hour.  Why?  Well, your meditation
rate is not based on your current mana level or your max mana
level, its based on your meditation skill, sit/stand status, and
clarity/breeze/flowing thought/lich/allure/manasong status.  So
if you have twice as much mana in your pool, that means you
can kill twice as many critters before you need to sit down... but
then must sit twice as long to get back to full mana.

If you want my (heritical) opinion, what you want to really twink
out a very low level character of any class is a nice fast hard
hitting weapon (10 damage max, as low a delay as you can manage)
and a lot of AC gear, HP next important and Mana not much of
a concern at all.  Now get out there and tank.  For the first ten
levels or so, its hard to beat this for efficiency.... better if you
are a class with some healing capability, but if not its time to learn
how to bind wounds really well, and fight on the lower half
of your HP bar so as not to have ugly med time.
