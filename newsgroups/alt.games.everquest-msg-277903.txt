Pointless to upgrade an Nvidia driver for anything below a 5xxx series card
these days, and has been for more than a year.  The only reason to upgrade
is to fix a specific problem, and the release notes should indicate exactly
what problem is fixed for the 4xxx series cards.  If you don't have that
problem, don't bother.  They aren't doing optimizations in the drivers for
anything under 5xxx's anymore.
