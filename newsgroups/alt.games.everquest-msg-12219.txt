Yes, (X)Emacs is difficult in general to learn because it
includes everything, even the kitchen sink!

When I first started using it, my boss was a "guru" and I
sat in amazement watching him do things with such speed.
Now, I'm that "guru" guy and people who watch me wonder
how the heck did I learn all that!

Not easy, but worth the time.  The macro features alone
place it soooooo far ahead of any other editor (including
vi, vile, vim, etc.) that it's worth learning just for
that.  I use Emacs to write shell scripts to do mundane
tasks and it takes me a fraction of the time to do it in
Emacs compared to other editors.

You bet!  Head to www.xemacs.org and go to the download page.
The Winbloze version is actually quite good.  Some of the stuff
that relies on Unix command (like buffer compare) may not work
since it calls "diff" externally, but editor-wise, it's complete.
