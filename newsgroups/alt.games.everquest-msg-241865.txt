You may want to mess around with your gamma settings, might help a 
little.  But, Gfay has always been like that.  I'll give you the 
following story to demonstrate:

When I first started playing EQ, I only had a woodelf.  I ran around 
Gfay for a long time not having any clue how to find other zones.  First 
time I saw the entrance to Felwithe I remember being afraid to go in.  
Anyway a few weeks into it, I accidentally zoned into BB.  My jaw just 
dropped.  I was blown out of my seat by the sky.  I didn't get far into 
the zone when I saw this orc running towards me, he takes one look at me 
and drops me like a stone.
