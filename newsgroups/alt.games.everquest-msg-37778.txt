There's the answer to your question. The dealy on your fists, even wearing your
gauntlets, is (I believe) 36.  If he was using any sort of weapon (though I
rather doubt it was a war hammer) it probably had a significantly faster delay,
so he attacks faster.  Very likely you got grouped with a twink, and he was
using Master Wu's Trance Stick, or a fighting baton or somesuch. If it was
longer, like a quarterstaff, it might have been a cane of the tranquil. Any of
this will be faster and outdamage your fist damage/speed.
