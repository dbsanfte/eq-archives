De's are fun, especially to Roleplay

Anywhere where there is a "good" town. Rivervale, Akanon and Felwithe are
the ones I know of. If you aren't sure, stand far away from the guard. Con
them (Target and press 'C'), If they are Scowling at you, or glaring
threateningly, they WILL attack, so stay away. Anything else and they won't
bother you.

At level 12 you get the spell "Bind Affinity", You can bind yourself
anywhere with this spell. You can also bind others to City zones.

Levels 20 and 24 you get Self ports. Levels 29 and 34 you get Ports for the
group. "Gate" spells are self ports. "Portal" Spells are group ports.
"Evacuation" spells are group ports that cast much faster, but have a chance
of leaving one member behind. Evacs are used in emergencies to bail the
group out.

Wizards have a different role in groups than most. Wizards can't do damage
over time like most other classes do. We blast once all at once. Usually
we're good to have when mobs need to go down faster, or in an emergency
where you need the mob dead *right now*. Most people that refuse wizards in
groups are very closed minded. Most people I've talked to when I was unsure
of my own Wizard said that wizards are excellent at higher levels, crucial
for raids, and a great asset to a group. I've just chosen to ignore the few
that don't like wizards. There's always going to be a few who don't like us,
so why pay them any attention? :)

Stick with a robe and work on getting INT items. If you want to Tailor, work
on making silk.

NO! Stick with channeling and evocation. Everything else will go up on its
own. Channeling and Evocation are important, with a few points of alteration
for when those ports come along.

Have fun man, WIZARD PRIDE! W0000T!
