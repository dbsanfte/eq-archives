Actually, it WOULD be difficult to program what the original poster
(EverQuestsDaBest) posted. I don't understand quite what you're
getting at...

if youre gonna lose, the game determines that, and then has your
charecter go
to the quickest zone possible, since thats what u would do if u were
in the
game.

why dont they do that?"

It would be extremely difficult to program the game to predict who
would win the battle, and also to program your LD character to run to
the zone if it was going to lose, what to do, etc. It would require a
lot of change to the current EQ engine.

Anyway, I don't think the current LD system is horribly broken.
