As someone said.. you cannot progress in level unless you fight MOBs, but
for some characters, fighting MOBs isnt really their prime ability. For
example, a rogue could go around stealing stuff instead.
I sent an idea to Verant  that classes should get XP for doing class
oriented stuff.
This would make classes do their *own* abilities alot more and cause players
to play their characters more often as they should.

I.e:
A rogue should get XP for pickpocketting and picking locks
A priest for ressurecting
A Druid for charming animals
Tanks for hitting successfully & being beaten up
A Wizard for landing offensive spelles
An Enchanter for enchanting
A Shaman for debuffing and buffing
And ofcourse all get XP for defeating MOBs.

These are just ideas, and not my full interpretation of how it should work.
