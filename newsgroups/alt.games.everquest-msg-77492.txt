Linux -- free, INN -- free, hardware requirements -- pretty minimal
unless traffic really takes off, bandwidth requirements -- see hardware.
The learning curve is an issue, especially with INN.

Setting up a group on the public Usenet is a bear, since you've got
to convince news admins (via discussion in alt.config or wherever)
to carry your group. 

On your own INN server, you just type "ctlinnd newgroup name.of.group".

The idea of a private EQ newsgroup server is intriguing. By 'private' 
I mean disconnected from the public Usenet, containing only locally-
posted content. Ideally there would be no registration required to post.

The question is, would it take off as an alternative to the bloated,
slow web boards? My guess is that it wouldn't. And if it did, someone 
would have to foot the bill (or require subscriptions, yuck). Also, 
newsgroups are a lot easier to abuse than web boards. Would the Ebaying 
numbnuts discover it and start flooding the groups with their FOR SALE 
messages?
