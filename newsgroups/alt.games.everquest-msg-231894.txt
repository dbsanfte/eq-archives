I got mine running around the area between the windmill and the river.
Sometimes he did spawn up in the mountains near the windmill as well. I know
I have seen him in the northwest near the tower too.
It wasnt anywhere near 20-60 kills for me, more like 80-100.

You dont need it for charm kiting...it just makes it a lot easier because
you dont have to swap instruments in and out.

If you cant afford/get the ring, you could try this combo:
Main Hand: Epsomite Flute
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23992
Off-hand: Battle-drummer's Main Gauche
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17756

Then you dont have to do any swapping at all, but you still have the usual 3
second delay on invis song.
