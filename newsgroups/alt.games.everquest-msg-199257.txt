Personally I would never consider Porcupining/melee'ing a mob over level
with a druid of 20 or higher. We simply cant take the beating that would be
required. We have the same armor types available to us as a Beastlord ( more
or less, Im discounting Elysian here ), but dont mitigate damage NEARLY as
well.

Additionally, at 55 I now have a 193 Defense, and thats just from incidental
hits from accidental aggro. In fact I got point 193 on a COM raid last
night. A Black Reaver gave me a point of defense, when he whiffed on me for
getting to close to the tanks. Sucker dropped a Jade Reaver ( which I still
need ) and I promplty rolled a 34 on the /rand for Druids/rangers that still
needed /me sobs!

Ah well.. need to go back to COM for the Chanters in the guild anyways.....
