at 41 the spectres in Oasis provide a pretty good fight/exp ratio; I
when from 40 to 45 there.  DO NOT hunt the spectres in OOT as they
proc a 32 hp life tap which really sucks.....

also, the left side of the beach in Gunthak is mostly all undead, and
TASTY xp.  I took my monk there with a shammy comrade for some fun; we
walked away with 3 blu xp in under an hour; all he had to do was slow,
haster & regen...I did the rest.

basement of Unrest; pally's can OWN unrest in the 40s and on, and plus
with all of the drops that get collected down there U can easily make
over 100pp per camping.

SolA (or is that SolB, I get the 2 confused) is also good xp with all
of the kobold killing to be had.  loot is pretty decent too.

lastly, while other have mention the Skel camp near the Kunark spire
in DL, I would suggest trying the mostly unused skel camp near the FV
tunnel in DL.  its a 5 - 7 spawn camp and theyre about the same, but
with the added benefit of having other mobs nearby in case U happen to
clear the camp and are still looking for monsters to
slice/club/pierce.

all of these can be solo'd if ya got KEI, but w/o it then only the 1st
two places are viable non-group IMNSHO.

good hunting comrade!
