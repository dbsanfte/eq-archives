This is a "feature".
Since assist always assists your target you just want it to say /assist 
(Who else would it assist?)
Since in some raid situations you always want to assist the MA you can 
use this "feature" to lock your macro to the MA at the start of the raid 
with out having to type their long and confusing name out.

Just remove th %t from your macro.

HTH,

Jim
