Hail, all!

Just wondering... I've (finally) managed to save some pp and am looking
forward to placing an order with a master-jeweller for my Ogre warrior.

I was thinking of getting a pair of +7 str, +7 dex Velium fire-emerald
rings...  Are they what I need or are they better-suited for rogues?  Is
there something better dropped in the game?

As a side question, what would be good for the ear slots?

Regards,

Lowbie
