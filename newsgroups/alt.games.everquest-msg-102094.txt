Snippy. 
Everquest characters are never erased. The only case they have been
has probably been known exploiters booted from the game. Every
character you've deleted even exists still, or did when the tribunal
server had a glitch and they all came back from the backup server.
Characters people only got to level 1 and deleted the first day were
back. It was funny because the earliest date got to keep the name so
if a "Bilbo" was deleted in the first hour the server was up, it was
back and "Bilbo" while a level 50 person named Bilbo created after the
first hour would be "BilboX."

The guaruntee is like 6 months but they've never erased them.
