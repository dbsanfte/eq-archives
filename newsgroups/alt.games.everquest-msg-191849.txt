You don't have to do "every Brownie out there."  That line of spells 
temporarily boosts your faction with the faction of the mob that you have 
targeted.  If you target a Brownie and cast Benevolance, your "Brownie" 
faction is temporarily raised so all Brownies will like you better / hate 
you less.

The temporary change goes away when you zone, and =may= have a time limit 
on it, although I've never seen it wear off.
