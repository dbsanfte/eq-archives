To be fair, though, he did change his password after "loaning" the account.
The thief did a password recovery to reset the account to the old password.
This seems like a rather dangerous security hole at best (why do people
change their password: because the old one was compromised). I'd would have
expected the "lost password recovery" to always set the password to a random
string that is then e-mailed to the address specified on the account.

So, I guess the next question is, suppose I do loan someone my account (for
whatever reason). What do I have to do to guarantee that they'll never be
able to gain access to it? Change the password twice?
