Is the non-ring drop from the Sarnak Courier for one a shackle quest?  I've
been wanting to take him down, but since I have sworn off Kunark for a
while, it may be some time before I snuff him - assuming I can find his
quick-dying, rarely-popping ass.

I may just cmap my Necro over between the Windmill and the lake and do the
15-minute before you play and 15-minute after you play log in with him to
see if I can find him.  Maybe I'll even learn how to play him again.
