I presume that your hard drive is partitioned into as many 2 GB
partitions as needed to use all its capacity (duh).

You can use software like Partition Magic to adjust partition sizes,
convert file systems (i.e. Fat16 to FAT32/NTFS), and add, delete, or
move partitions but one way or another you will have to find the drive
space to add to your Everquest partition.

I think you will have to convert file systems since you have 2 GB
partitions which are legacy from Windows 95 and before (FAT16). (You
are not running Windows 95?) With a conversion to FAT32, you can
make/adjust the partition sizes to greater than 2 GB.

If you need all your paritions, or the hard drive really isn't big
enough to devote 3 or 4 GB to an Everquest partition, you should look
at a larger hard drive (presuming your motherboard and bios can handle
it).

If you tell us your operating system and hard drive size, maybe even
how old the system is, we can give more/better advice.
