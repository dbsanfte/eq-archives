There are a couple of places I usually go - the Golra iceberg in Timorous
Deep and Basilisk caves in JaggedPine.  They don't have above average ZEM's,
but they are safe and what you usually miss in terms of quality (i.e. high
ZEM) you can make up with in quantity.  Golras are around levels 25-27
(Hulking Golras higher - probably stay away from them for PLing purposes).
They do stagger slowly away when low on health, but if they get too far they
warp back to their spawn point, so runners are not a problem.  Cave
Basilisks in JaggedPine are near the Blackburrow zone-in crystal.  There are
two types - regular basilisks and Genitors.  They start around level 30 and
go up to 34-35 I think.  Just take one of the caves and work your way around
it killing basilisks.  The Genitors are KoS, but aggro ranges are so small
that you'd have to walk right over one to aggro it.  They do run fast when
low on health, but don't go past the entrance to their cave.  A group of us
recently PL'ed a mid-30's warrior is Kaesora a bit in the undead area (from
entrance tunnel, went straight forward, dropped down a shaft and wandered
around till we found a bunch of skellies).  The undead don't run, but you
might get mobbed wandering around there - lots of things were seeing invis.
