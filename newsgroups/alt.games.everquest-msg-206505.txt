I was having major problems in FM last night, was booted every 5-10
minutes.  Ugh so frustrating.  I told me partner that I would be trying to
fix EQ and not coming back on tonight for any length of time.

So... I tried deleting all .TXC files, no luck, still crashed.  I renamed
my eqclient.ini file.  Again no luck.  I got really frustrated and just
deleted everything but everquest.exe (so it EQ would update as its just
the launcher)  The update took close to an hour, I started it up again and
everything seemed to work ok.  I played around for about 15 minutes, no
crashes.  I am going to do some more testing tonight to see what happens,
see if I can make it crash.  The only pain in the ass will be getting
everything back to the way it was.  Though luckily I dont tweak much so it
should only take me about 5 minutes tops, heh.

Wish me luck :)
