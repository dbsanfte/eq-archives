I'd call it a tie.  Both sides are constantly on the defensive, but also 
constantly slinging mud.  It'd be nice to actually have candidates who did 
neither, wouldn't it?

}You have a point.  However, when truely principled people come around, I

}Democratic party.

I think that depends entirely on which true principles said person has, 
and which they consider the most important.  And in general, I'd say it's 
still not a very close match in either case... both parties seem to be so 
caught up in partisanship that they've wandered pretty far away from 
principles entirely.

}I don't think J.C. Watts would have made a good Democrat.

Who?

}Of course, there is the side issue attached to this of "Why The Hell Do We

Because they're willing to run.  Our best are smart enough to do something 
more useful with their lives than get involved in a partisan brawl.

}Unfortunately, that's been pretty well bastardized.  "Religion is to be seen
}and not heard" seems to be the attitude of today.  I think it's starting to
}swing, as some religious types with a cantankerous streak are being more
}willing to stick their thumbs in the eye of "approved" opinion.

Unfortunately, I would have interpreted it as "Religion is allowed to do 
its thing as long as it doesn't try to push its views down the throats of 
the uninterested".  But you're right, I definitely see a swing back toward 
Judeochristians and monotheists having more rights than those of other 
faiths.

True enough.  There seem to be enough members of any of the above 
categories willing to go well beyond criticism.

You seem so sure that we're not...

}Well, capitalism has the advantage of taking greed and turning it to the
}common good, that can't truely be denied.

It can be debated.  I think it definitely has that intent, but doesn't do 
as perfect a job of it as you claim.  It seems more often to turn greed to 
the common 'less bad'.

}However, I think just about ever reputable right-wing thinker understands 
}that capitalism goes far, far beyond simple rewarding of greed.

The problem with this assertion is that you're implying that in contrast, 
no liberals or left-wingers believe that.  Which is not the case, by a 
long shot.  Capitalism is not the property of conservatives, it is not 
their brainchild, and they are not the exclusive defenders of it.

}In order to benefit myself, I must do
}right by my customers.  I like the fact that the market punishes those who
}are truely greedy (and put themselves ahead of their customers).

I find the market to be very unsuccessful on that score.  Otherwise we 
wouldn't have so many products that are cheapass crap that falls apart the 
instant the warranty expires.  And we wouldn't have so many companies 
profiting off of a continual lowering of product standards.

Then there's the tobacco companies...
