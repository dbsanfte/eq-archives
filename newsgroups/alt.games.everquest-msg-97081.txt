Here's some cheese to go with your collective whines.

Verant offers some VERY aggressive changes that will AID the casual gamer,
and many people (the same ones who bitched about these types of things being
problems in the past) are now whining:

"Getting to lvl 35 and not needing the book was an ACCOMPLISHMENT, now it's
nothing..."

"Why not just start all characters at level 10..."

"With the new rezzes, CR's are a thing of the past..."

"U want my experience back from all the hell-levels..."

Get a grip.  These are good changes.  Go play DAoC, AC, or AO, and you'll
see similar in-game things that almost make the game easier for the casual
gamer.  The fact is that many new players load up EQ, get some
accomplishments, then lose their corpse and quit playing (paying).  Verant
wants EQ to be more enticing to new users and wants to stay on top of the
competition.  IMHO, they are making many right moves.
