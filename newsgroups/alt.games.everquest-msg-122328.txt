Unfortunately you also have to bring your own group :(. I play at odd times
sometimes due to there being trouble finding a group. I am trying to switch
back to a more normal playing time and need somewhere where I don't have to
bring a group. Plus there are times when I have to get off suddenly, so
pickup groups are ideal.
