We can't help you. You've already invested fifty two levels into playing
a ranjah, and you're unlikely to start a new class now.
:-)
Ah, ok! I see that wasn't the problem you were asking about. Let's move
on.

Nope. Sounds about right.

No. Not unless they introduce some special PoP AA skill we haven't seen
yet that falls along the lines of the wizard spell Disintigrate, or that
Assasinate thingie the rogues get (I think?) but even then you get no xp
or loot from the mob, so it's useless for wizards. You'll have to slay
them slowly but surely like the rest of us, sadly.

If that whole "Real Life Argument" were to hold true, don't you thank
that a golem made of solid stone weighing over two tons with a fist that
weighs over four hundred pounds shouldn't be able to splat your leather
wearing ass into a bloody ranjah shaped stain on the floor every time
with a single overhand blow to the top of your head?

Let's not hope for too much "Real Life" out of the game. The new casters
resists and AI are a bit much as it is. he he.

Yep. But you ain't gonna do it with one arrow, chief. ;-)
