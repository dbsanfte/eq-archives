Let's see, in keeping with Blizzard's traditions:

1)  WoW will not release until 2005
2)  Classes will be unbalanced
3)  25 Cheats will be figured out in the first week, and nothing will be
changed
4)  All the PCs will have names like "bIgd1ksuxxor"
5)  Their (cough) vast experience in 3D will ensure that the engine is
ancient in 2005

Should be a rich playground for the 10 year old set.
