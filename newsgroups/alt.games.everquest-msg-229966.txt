You know, I have heard this about so many other online
games...especially Star Wars Galaxies.  Just about all my RL friends
quit Everquest in favor of Star Wars Galaxies and they all cancelled
their accounts for SWG in less than two months because they game is
supposedly boring.  I was told that it was cool running around
Tatooine and other planets to see the sights that Star Wars made
famous (or infamous).  Outside of that, it's supposedly boring. 
Apparently it's easy to get to a top level in a particular trade.

It seems that Dark Ages of Camelot has a small following.  As a matter
of fact, it sounds like DAoC is a much better game than SWG.  I used
to read the SWG site all the time to see the updates and screen shots
and I got the impression that SWG was going to be the be all end all
of online games.

It seems that Everquest is often imitated but never duplicated.
