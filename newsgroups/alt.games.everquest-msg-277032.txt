If there's enough money in the market the monopolists will create
entry barriers sufficient to block new competitors.  Historicly,
these barriers have often been implemented outside the market
itself (murder, vandalism, and arson have all been popular over
the years).

I'll admit that some markets are, for various reasons, resistant
to monopoly forces (flea markets and farmer's markets come to
mind).  My "no such thing as a free market" comment was a bit of
mild hyperbole.  But only a bit.
