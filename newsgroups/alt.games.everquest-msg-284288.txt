The Pyzjin cycle is pretty simple to follow. Pyzjin can spawn at 9pm, 
12am, 3am, or 6am game time. The ph that will usually spawn instead 
of her is "a skeleton" which will then wander to the ruins and stand in 
the middle. It begins at 6pm game time, if there is a brown or grizzly 
bear at the ruins or over to the road in front of Surefall Glade kill it. It's
the ph for the first Pyzjin spawn at 9pm. If "a skeleton" spawns instead 
kill it as soon as possible to keep the cycle on track. It also speeds 
things up to kill everything at the ruins from 9pm to 6am, just make 
sure to kill the ph first and keep and eye out for Pyzjin. 

She can spawn in a number of places in the general ruins area, from 
the road to about halfway down to Blackburrow and will then walk to 
the ruins and stand in the middle. I hear that she despawns after 
awhile, but I have always killed her before then so don't know how 
long she remains. With this cycle I picked up about 14 GBS and 14 
Fabled GBS for all of my alts in the last few anniversary periods. If 
you're lucky you can spawn 2 or 3 Pyzjin in one night, but the normal 
spawn is 1 a night most of the time.

As for the story of the GBS I have no idea other than it being 
Varsoon's Black Heart. The lore and quests of the oldworld EQ is
so broken and obscure I doubt that most of them work as they
were intended even today. Just my 2 cents.

Pez please
