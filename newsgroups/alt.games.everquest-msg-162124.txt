Not to go off on you, but is it just me or are most people to lazy to do a
damn Google search.  2/3 of the questions that have came up have been
answered by doing a ?search and checking 1 or 2 sites in the list.

Now to answer your question.  Check out this page. EverQuest Casters Realm
http://eq.crgaming.com/  Under the "class areas"  You will find all the
basic information you need on all the classes.  There are even spoiler
guides in them if you dig deep enough.

I don't know how this one is, but it was the second page listed when I did
the ?search for you.  Ohh and it is all about beastlords.

PS.  Hope the info helps.
