Well I decided to toss the Voodoo 5 and got an Nvidia Geforce 3 instead.  I
havent had the game freeze during play, and graphics look great.

Now when I zone, or even before I can enter the world my screen goes blank
as if to go on standby.  The only way to undo it is to hold power button and
reboot.

I have tried many different suggestions including disabling Creative Live,
reducing AGP aparture (sp?), as well as disabling ALL power saving options
in Windows ME and Bios.

Anyone have any other ideas?  This sucks, and again this has been happening
ever since the 1/17 patch that was supposed to give Luclin zones better
performance.
