Those Raptors are vicious little buggers, and as you say, seem to
bring pals in from a hundred yards away!

Assuming you mean the pet didn't get killed, the pet often lags waayyy
behind you.  This causes endless fun when you start a melee... and
THEN you realise you have no trusty sidekick with you, lol.  "Summon
Companion" spell (or items that cast it) do come in pretty handy!

Water is odd stuff in EQ.  You cannot cast a spell on something in the
water while you are out (or above) it, and vice versa.  NPC's don't
seem to have this problem, at least not while they're kicking MY butt
:)

They are VERY handy.  Slowing the mob means you take less damage, as
they are hitting you more slowly.  If you weaken them as well, they do
less damage when they hit.  "Drowsy" was something I used at the
outset of every fight, at that level.  

It gets even better when YOU get a "Haste" type of spell, potion or
item.  With a 36% Haste Aug and a spell/potion to go with it (ONE
spell or Haste potion and ONE Haste item stack) I have about a +80%
Haste, while I slow the mobs down for about -40%.  Nice to have the
odds on your side  ;)  

>Well that's all for now,again many thanks

Nice to see your posts  :)  How old ARE you, by the way?  Closest
decade will do, heh.
