Number 2 does really rule out an awful lot. You're basically saying that 
a chess master exhibits no skill. If I'm incorrect in that example, then 
I have no idea what you're shooting for specifically. Dexterous ability? 
I think the bard class is the only one designed to require any sort of 
dexterity from the player.

Gems may have counted though.
