Um, are you folks actually giving this thread any conscious thought?
Jesus is the GM.  If it pleases Him to snare himself He can do it
however it pleases him to do so.  If it pleases Him to walk on water,
or transform water into wine, or rez himself, well that's His
perogative.  And there's no particular reason to believe that any of
His "exploits" are available to regular players, excepting insofar as
you believe the various transcriptions/translations of His official
announcements.
