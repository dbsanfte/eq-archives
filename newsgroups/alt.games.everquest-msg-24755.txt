It's like all versions of invisibility (Camo, superior camo,
hide, etc) when you loot a corpse, use a merchant or go to
turn in a quest item invis fails, However, from what I have
heard, someone else can then cast invis on you for quests,
once you have opened the initial "trade" screen, and you
will then be invis, with indiff faction.
