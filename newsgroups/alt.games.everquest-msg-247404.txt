But do they really have to pay for that?  I thought that even if
you stopped paying for your account, that just meant you wouldn't
be able to log in, but your characters are still saved forever.

And this makes perfect sense for SOE, since it costs next to nothing
to store the data for the characters, and it means the player always
has the option to reactivate the account and resume playing those
characters (which presumably makes it more likely that at least some
people who "cancel" do in fact return eventually).

Which is why, as you say, the only way to REALLY quit the game is to
delete all your characters and THEN stop paying for the account.
At least that way, if you do come back, you're coming back as a "new"
player. :)
