Hi,
that the spells I usually use when I m dueling  :

    Darkness , a drain life dot, a direct drain life ( not the most
powerfull for my lvl but the one I get at the previous spells circle ), a
dot or two ( venom of the snake / heat blood....), I also use shadow step
and harmshield. In my opinion fear is unfaire in duel. For the tactic : try
to snare with darkness as quick as possible, send you pet ; cast shadow step
and then the drain life dot and try to survive by casting the other dot,
direct drain life ....

PS : I never use Shadow step in the Arena, maybe you can go out of the PvP
area ....
PS2 : You can use Gather shadow too after a shadow step ( never test this )
PS3 : apologize me for my poor english
