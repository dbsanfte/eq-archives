  That's what web sites are for.

  Here are some good ones:

  http://eq.castersrealm.com ... Probably has the best spell listings
of any EQ web site, with some other good stuff.

  http://www.allakhazam.com ... I favor this one for quest info and
equipment searches.  Also, the bestiary is pretty good.  Also, look
under the "tips" section for a few of those "tidbits" you're trying to
soak up.

  http://www.everlore.com ... I use this one mainly for the bestiary.

  http://www.eqatlas.com ... Really good maps and zone information in
general.  This is the first place I go when I'm planning on raiding an
unfamiliar dungeon.

  Note that some of these are considered "spoiler sites", but to be
quite honest, spoilers are a virtual necessity in EQ if you really
want to get anything accomplished.  At first it's fun to do a few
quests and figure out your way around on your own, but after a while a
little of the novelty wears off and you get frustrated when your
aimless wanderings also end up usually being fruitless ones.  You work
so hard to spin your wheels, but you don't go anywhere (or worse, go
backwards). :)

  Finally, the eqmanual_supplement.doc file in your EverQuest
directory (default is C:\Program Files\EverQuest) has a lot of
information about various game commands and functions of the front
end.  If you can't quite remember the name of a command, or are
wondering if there are any features to the front end to make things
like targeting, or using spells or skills easier, check here.

  It may be a lot of information to soak in, but this file is a LOT
more informative than the manuals that come with the game (or at least
the manuals that came with the original EQ, the initial Kunark
expansion and Velious... maybe the Trilogy pack and Luclin have better
printed manuals).  Even after a couple years of playing, I still found
very useful things I didn't know in this file.
