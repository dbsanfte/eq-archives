There are a couple guards way deep in Neriak that I used to power through 
56 or 57.  I grouped with a shaman and between the two of us we were in an 
almost constant frenzy of pull, shammy DOT, bard DOT, manasong, loot, 
repeat.  The guards were all still blue to me at 56, and this was back 
before cyan, so I'm not sure if we passed up any exp-giving greens.
