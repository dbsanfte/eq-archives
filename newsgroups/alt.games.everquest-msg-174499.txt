I have a beef with this whole "whoever says CIHYS first gets the quitter's
stuff" thing.  Think about it, when you break down CIHYS, it means, "Can I
have your stuff?"  In other words, *not* "I claim your stuff by right of
first claim" (ICYSBROFC).  So, I would think the quitter has the right to
say "No, you can't have my stuff, but *he* can", giving it to someone who
didn't ask first, since after all, CIHYS is a request, not an imperative
command/claim.  That being the case, I think the first to say CIHYS
shouldn't necessarily get the stuff.  So:

To any and all persons who ever choose, have chosen, or will choose to quit
Everquest, for any reason whatsoever, under any circumstances whatsoever, in
fact to anyone who plays, ever has played, or ever will play EQ and does
not/did not/will not keep every item ever obtained by his/her character(s)
in any manner, form, or fashion -- ICYSBROFC.

There.  That should cover my bases.
