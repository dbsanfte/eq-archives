I have bought several of those guides and most of them require you to sit
and bake or tailor or something like that to get the plat and they claim
100pp per hour but that is a very boring way to do it. Others require you to
have a mid level and do some quests and again you work hard to get the
components and then you wind up with an item that sells for uber plat in ec
like a blue diamond or a diamond or something like that but those prices
have fallen to the level where you will spend several RL hours playing and
only get 1k for the trouble and that averages out to less than 50pp an hour.
My secret was to get enough plat to buy low in EC and from vendors and sell
high but this requires a good knowledge of current sale prices and you will
spend much of your time in EC auctioning and reading the ads. That is not
that much fun either. Best advise is get in a good guild and get your
character to lvl50 and then the plat will not be a problem. IMHO.
