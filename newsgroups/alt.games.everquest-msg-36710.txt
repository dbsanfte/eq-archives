I understood that you failed to say exactly how KoS you were to
exactly which faction groups.  It makes a difference.

Another part of your reply seems to indicate that my question
was on point:

I note that you didn't mention how many kills it took you to get
out of "Scowling".  If your necro started at only "Threatening",
he would be "KoS", but of a more benign sort of KoS than many
other race/class combinations would be.

"Threatening" will only get you attacked if you hang around
too long, it gives you a good chance to run past the "threatening"
NPC without aggroing it.  For example, I had a level 1 Ogre in
Kael Drakkel who is technically "KoS", but he was only "threatening"
KoS, not "scowling" KoS.  As a test, I ran him all the
way through Kael from the EW entrance to the WL exit, not
invisible, several times.  He managed to make it 2 out of
3 times without getting attacked, simply by virtue of
being only "threatening KoS" and not "scowling KoS".  But a
"scowling KoS" PC wouldn't have had a chance in hell of
getting past the first pair of guards, period.

If your PCs were "threatening" to the Paineel guards,
and a necro PC would certainly be not quite as unwelcome
in Paineel as John's Magician, that could explain why 
you made it through without incident whereas John got 
pasted every time.

That was the reason for my question.  So now we know
which part *you* didn't understand.
