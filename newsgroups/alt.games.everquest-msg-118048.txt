The order of the events should have been:

disable your old video card.. install the drivers for your new video card
(not necessarily the software, just the drivers)

then install the PCI card, then reboot.

your computer is loading up with a video card that it has no knowledge about
and doesn't know how to use it, so you have to install the drivers before
you reboot.

Chris.

ps - in all honesty it should work without installing the drivers first,
because it would still take basic graphics, it would just knock the
resolution and color down a whole lot until you set up the drivers, but
hopefully if you try it in that order it will help.

pps - my laptop is an HP and I love it, but I don't know if I would buy a
desktop from them.
