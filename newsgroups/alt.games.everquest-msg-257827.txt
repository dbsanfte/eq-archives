Which is exactly why we *always* have re-patches and emergency patches ....
they never seem to take any notice of the bug reports on test. Some stuff I
admit could be missed with the small population on test but the common bugs
like that should be sorted before it goes live. After all that's what a
"test server" is for .... isn't it?!

SOE seem to just use test to make sure the code is stable(ish) ... I don't
see much, if any, evidence of them fixing bugs reported on test before it
goes live. It always seems like they don't take much notice of an update
until it's gone live ... take the PVP augs that were on sale at LDoN
vendors, you can't tell me that they weren't showing up on the test server.
If they weren't showing up on test then it begs the question what's
different between the live and test server setups? ... or did they have it
on test then "tweak it" a little just before it went live causing the bug.
