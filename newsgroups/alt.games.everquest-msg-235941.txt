you gain mana back over time, sitting is faster then standing, sitting on
horse is the same as sitting, Breeze/clairty/kei/Tranq/VoQ and Flowing
thought all add to the mana regen speed, FT stacks with a the first bunch i
listed.

Number per tick based on your Meditate skill and mana regen buffs you have
active on you

> meditation, Flowing Thought/Clarity?

sitting is meditation but yes

> Does Flowing Thought stack with Clarity and the like?

Flowing thought stacks with the clarity line just fine, FT doesnt have a
buff icon its just there
Flowing thought 1 is 1 more mana per tick regen, ft 5 is 5 more etc
max FT you can have is 15, this stacks with the clairty line of spells and
Mental clairty aaxp

yes, but you need different regen buffs for health compared to mana regen
