I think my warrior got his first critical around level 14 or 15. Rangers
probably get them around the same level. Don't get too excited, they account
for very little actual damage. When I run a log parser my total damage from
criticals is around 3.5%. But even that is a bit misleading, since the
critical hit would be a regular hit otherwise. So the actual increase is
about 2%. Nice, but nothing to get excited about. They just look cool, like
when I got a crit with a weighted axe the other day, it hit for 240 damage.
Dex makes a difference, mine is 77, so a higher dex might add an extra
percent or two. As far as I know, there is no level or skill base that
affects criticals, only deterity. Warriors get crits on any type of attack,
including kicks and bashes, Rangers get them on bows, Rogues get them on
thrown weapons. I've never heard of casters getting criticals, though I know
some classes get bonuses, like clerical healing.
