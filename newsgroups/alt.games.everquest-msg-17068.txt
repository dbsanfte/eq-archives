My experience has been much the same. Maybe three or four times I accepted
because I was searching for something to do in game, or was at a
"crossroads" of sort. Each time the experience was terrible. In fact, each
time also marked the only occasions on which I've disbanded without a word.
I usually give a reason, whatever it is, but these people were too horrid to
even bother with an explanation.

Just like the rule about drive-by guild invites, all should make it a policy
to stand clear of this type of group invites.
