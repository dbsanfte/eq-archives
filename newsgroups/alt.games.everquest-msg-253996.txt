Try Cyclops Island in Timorous deep,Clops there drop
surprisingly often gems or jewelry in the 50 to 100p range.
And there is a bonus in form of a named giant,Gornit,who
is weaker than giants in RM,but on the same loot table.
There is a Vendor on the next isle and since the boats are
out of order you can reach the isle very fast now.
Test runs there with my 65 Ranger netted around 1k per hour.
On SolRo this place is deserted.
