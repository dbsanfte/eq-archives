I only get the freeze up when I'm playing my main, 64 magician, never an
alt. Every time it happens, I've just left the big bank, am heading towards
the Nexus/Qeynos/PoT/Freeport stones section of PoK, I'm levitated and using
J-Boots. If I am not flying or not using J-Boots or headed to a different
area of PoK it has never froozen up on me. Only with those combinations do I
get the bug. And yes, when I forget to click off J-Boots or Levitate, I will
get the freeze up and a nice ten minute wait to get back into game.

My theory , is that there is a graphic string from one of the trees that is
so small as to be not rendered by our cards, but when we get stuck because
you can't run through the tops of trees in PoK unlike the trees in WKarana
for example, the computer goes into logic circles because something that
isn't there ( minute branch of tree sticking way out) stops us and the
computer can't let us go forward but this object doesn't corespond to known
object co-ordinates and so the logic circle is created and the lock-up
occurs. Just a theory. Thanks Sony for all the wasted time :-D
