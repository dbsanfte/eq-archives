Why both root and atone?  Suppose you just rooted, and the pets attacked.
Assuming that the mob was just an add, so isn't particularly pissed at
anyone, I'd hope that the pets could generate enough aggro before root
breaks to hold it.

Or, why not just atone, as soon as you see the pet attack?  If the atone
works, the pet should quickly get an hold aggro.
