Why? The players may be mindlessly shouting at each other, but they're
not interacting in any meaningful way like they would be 'in the
field', so to speak. 95% of them are probably ignoring chat and other
characters completely while they run to bank or another stone. That is
not anything like what I am talking about.

Compare that to Unrest in original EQ or even LoIO after Kunark. You
still had the interminable blather of course but you also have the
trains, the getting to know each other by reputation whether or not
you're grouped with them, people shouting warning to each other, mass
chaos sometimes, and other fun stuff.

PoK doesn't have any of that.

I do not want a single player or single group game with a chat server
wrapped around it, and that's what PoK is in great detail responsible
for creating.
