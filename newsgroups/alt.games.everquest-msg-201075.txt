My understanding is that Dex matters for the melee skills in general.  
Assuming that melee skills work the same as tradeskills, then, having more 
than one of the stats high will make zero difference.  It uses only the 
highest of the stats that can be used for determining chances of a skillup.  
So, I would never bother with a KEI on a melee only character, unless I was 
doing tradeskills, where INT/WIS are usually the only stats that can be 
used.
