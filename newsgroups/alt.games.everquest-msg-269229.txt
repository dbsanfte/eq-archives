From Moorgard on the official forums:

"We wanted to let budding crafters know about a change that is about to
happen to harvesting that should please a lot of you running around
low-level zones trying to raise your harvesting skills.

Level 10 base components (i.e. those found in Antonica and
Commonlands) will require a skill level of 20 to harvest them rather
than the current skill level of 40.

This should ease congestion in the low-level zones and make better use
of the abundant resources available in Antonica and Commonlands.

This change is expected to go live in tomorrow's update."


Seems I won't have to give up on foresting and trapping after all.
