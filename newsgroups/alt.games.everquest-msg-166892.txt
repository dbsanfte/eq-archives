I thought my quadding skills weren't too shabby. Level 60 and pulling four
Timeless Golem's in the Grey - not bad I thought, as quadding isn't *that*
easy in the Grey. Until I witnessed a level 60 Wizard do this .. he didn't
quad four *mobs* - he took on, and managed to pull off (easily) *three*
groups of four mobs! His mana pool must have been totally huge, I watched
him in total amazement. The Golem's were grouped in a bunch, as were the
Shissar's, it was awesome to watch, I didn't bother to hunt, I just watched.

I was so in awe of the guy, and his total expertise that I simply had to
send him a tell to congratulate him. He and I became friends for a while,
until (sadly) he moved away from Stormhammer a few weeks ago. I've never
seen anyone have the courage do do what he had done when it comes to
multi-kiting, awesome display.

Stevie.
