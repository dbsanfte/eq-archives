The last fear raid I was on, we were at the firewall when uberguild_01
came in to do Cazic. They killed the third golem (we'd killed two) and
pulled the big guy to the corner of the zone (northeast, iirc.)
Despite the fact that the zone was still half popped, they got no
adds.

I don't doubt that it's possible or even common for Cazic to call the
whole zone, but in the 2 Cazic fights I've seen, it didn't happen.
