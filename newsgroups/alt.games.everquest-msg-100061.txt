If you're up for a long journey and feeling adventurous (bring a lot of
food/drink or be prepared to pay some locals to shop for you) go to
Kurn's tower with your wizard. I've spent seven levels there up to 19,
and it's a fun, challenging zone. (Though the pathing blows goats.)
Start on the main and second floor with greather skellies and the
occasional scalebone, then move to the basement in a couple levels
(entry area only) for some larger skellies and furby excavators. There's
a safe room on the first floor where you can med in peace, even if AFK
(usually, anyway, unless somebody pulls them in there to fight stupidly,
then either  dies or zones with you on the hate list.) Tons of bone
chips which will sell well to people doing faction quests.

For your 6/7 level characters, you're really better just staying in the
newbie areas like EC, IMO, unless you are suicidally adventurous. You
*could* run to the Feerott and/or Rathe Mtns to do your lowbie levels.
Great zones, but shopping/selling etc. will be a nightmare for you and
the guards will slaughter you rather than helping.
