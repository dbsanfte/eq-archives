1) Get a few more levels, and a magic weapon (Is there a song that does this
now?) cheap at the bazaar, and you can hunt willowisps in commons for semi
decent loot. In the meantime, I seem to recall that the orc camps in EC were
pretty good loot for their level when I was struggling away on FV server.
(Do the belt quest in wf).
or 2) If you have pop and can quicly port between cities, then the bard mail
quest might be worth doing.  (Never used this myself, so I dont know if
theres too much delay on port to make it practical)
or 3) Go to FV, get a bind there, and go looting the corpses everyone in DL
cant be bothered looting. You could probably make some money "banking" there
too. When youre full, die and apear back at FV with all your stuff.
