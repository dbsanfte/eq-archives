I just started using it.  The different resolutions run a little wierd,
I run my desktop at 1024x768 if I run the game at that rez, the edges
get cut off.  If I run it at 1600x1280 it's actually fairly small.  I
haven't tried running two instances on the same computer, but I don't
think it would work too well, as the mouse is exclusive, and it's a pain
to get it out of the window and back in again.  So far I've just used it
so I could surf, look at maps etc while medding or waiting.  I noticed
that when my character was standing up, and I started typing in a url,
the keystrokes also went to EQ also, which is really wierd. It's also
nice that i can get my yahoo messenger messages without being tossed out
of EQ.  I was also thinking if I knew people who had YM, we could get a
voice chat going while in game.

It's not illegal, it might however be breaking your contract with
Sony/Verant.  Not too sure on that.
