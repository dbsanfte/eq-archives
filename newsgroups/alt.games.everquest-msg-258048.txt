I was under the impression that the melee delay "recycled" during casting
time, the same way as if I had turned off auto-attack. So when the, say 4
seconds casting time is up, I will attack immediately after it.

So for a hybrid, again assuming the same facts... 4 seconds cast time, 3
second swing, beginning casting after waiting 1.5 seconds - I will attack 4
seconds after (just as spell lands)...

Am I wrong?
