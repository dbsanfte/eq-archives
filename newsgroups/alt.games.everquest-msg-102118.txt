I agree - from 19 to 25 in a group at the Bandit Camp is good -
providing you can handle tripple pulls without going under 50% hps,
your group will rake in the loot and xps.

Ideal group is Tank heavy, a chanter makes it REAL sweet, a snarer
would be nice.

Clerics take care when you get GHeal - that juicy 300 point heal will
pull all the unengaged adds onto you - keep calm and let the tanks
finish their current tatger - don't run screaming, you're a plate
class character - they'll rescue you.

Everybody take care, most of the mobs here backstab, so guard your
behind!

I did 22 to 25 in two sessions of about two hours, and banked over
100pp in loot - drop the sullied weapons and copper jerwellery - the
prize loot is the pieces of bronze brigandine armour.

After 25, you'll need to go elsewhere - that is where I am now.
