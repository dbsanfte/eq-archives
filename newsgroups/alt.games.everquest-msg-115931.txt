Yes, I think that must be the point. At first I thought the idea was
that if someone grabs his characters, he can't get 'em back, but folks
here have said that's not true. 

So a further thought is that if his chars get stripped down, that'll
make it less likely that he'll continue to play, because he'd have to
build them back up again. 

Hey, I just do what he asks me to do!
