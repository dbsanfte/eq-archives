Nope, the file is only on the server in fact any char file is only on
the server to prevent that very problem.
There is no such file to edit.

There is none, because obviously if your buddy thought of this the
people making the game would have after 2 years.

They stop it by having everything on the server.
There were a few dupe bugs but they were much harder to do than 
your friend imagines because you had to fool the server manually, from
in game. 

One involved dying at precisely the right time you also fell into the
zone and zoned or something so you ended up with a corpse with gear on
it or some weird nonsense. Its nearly impossible to even do it on
purpose. I did see something like it happen recently to an ogre friend
of mine in skyfire during a guild raid on the dragon there, the ogre
asked us what to do with all the duped stuff on the extra corpse and
we said petition because verant basically regularly tracks for such
dupes which then = banning. He petitioned and the GM came and said
that because of his honesty and help with the bug, one of his uber
items of his choice on the dupe corpse could go to someone else in the
guild to use. We thought that was pretty cool of the GM. 

Knowing how the bug happened, you could try doing it for 2 years
without getting it right, circumstances have to be EXACTLY right for
it to then happen very rarely.
