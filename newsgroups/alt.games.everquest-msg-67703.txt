While there are doubtless some people out there who genuinely feel that a 7
year old OS should be supported indefinitely, I think the main point of
contention here isn't that they dropped support for Win95and older graphics
and sound cards, it's that they gave absolutely no warning they were going
to do so *for the basic engine*.

Not once did the EQ site say "blah bah fairly expensive stuff for Luclin..
oh and a better stuff for the basic game too" until AFTER it became
necessary. If they'd said even a month ago that the Luclin release was going
to up the specs for the basic game *even if you didn't purchase Luclin* then
a lot fewer people would be complaining now.

I personally am not having any problems (that I wasn't having before anway -
crashes to desktop are the bane of my EQ life!.) but I really feel bad for
those people who got about 1 days notice that they could no longer play the
basic game. If it had happened to me I think I'd be pretty cheesed off too.

Just my ï¿½0.02.
