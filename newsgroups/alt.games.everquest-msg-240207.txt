Well, nobody said you don't. But I feel it's a point worth stressing.  
You said "pickpocketing does no harm at all" and (in HHK) "so no group 
worries."  This doesn't say "don't check with your group", but it doesn't 
say "DO check with your group" either, which I feel is an important little 
thing to add in there , for any other rogues that might be looking in.

By the way, your post width is well over 80 characters.  This creates 
ugliness for some newsreaders (like mine).  You might consider narrowing 
up the window you post in, or looking for a setting to make lines wrap at 
70-75 characters.
