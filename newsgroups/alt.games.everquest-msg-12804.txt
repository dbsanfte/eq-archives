And yet, even after I started this thread about how vital it is to group,
particularly for warriors, last night I found myself in a place where I
was soloing blues with short relative downtimes, (while still nowhere near
as good as a fast pulling group) very minimal danger, and no deaths. I
didn't have long to play, but I got 3/5s of my first yellow bubble in 35
Hell soloing! I was in shock. [Not to mention that I made about 40 Plat.
Not a huge payday by any stretch of the imagination, but not too shabby
either.]
(And I'll tell ya'll where it is as soon as I ding. he he he.... unless
somebody guesses first, of course.)
