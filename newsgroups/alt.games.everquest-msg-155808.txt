Nobody <needs> mana regen buffs.  That said, I can kill blue con mobs
twice as fast or better solo with KEI than without.  I can hold any
camp in LGuk solo with KEI (with the possible exception of Lord, have
not tried it).  With KEI I can keep a group buffed (at 54 my buffs may
not match a Cleric's, but I can put over 500 HP plus some AC on every
member of the group, not exactly useless in the absence of a Cleric).
Without mana regen I can usually keep Divine Glory on everybody, but
only if I don't have to chain-stun casters while we're fighting.

Mana regen buffs add obvious value to any solo caster/hybrid, but in
a group they typically are worth even more to me as a hybrid than they
are to a non-melee caster because I rarely get to sit down and med
(this would obviously not be true in places that have insane sit agro,
but I haven't been to any of those places as yet).  So an Enchanter or
Bard or PotG/PotC Druid in a group increases my effectiveness quite a
bit, especially when there is no Cleric or the mobs are casters.
