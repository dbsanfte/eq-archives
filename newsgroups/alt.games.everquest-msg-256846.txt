I have to agree somewhat here. You have a point. But lvl70 doesn't make
you a more capable player. An additional spellslot does. One slot
doesn't look like much but I can't count the situations where I would
have been damn happy just to squeeze one spell more into my lineup. Be
it the bard or the enchanter.
And my chars are 65. (ok, the enchanter is only 64)
Of course people benefit alot from lvl70. Older raid targets aren't that
harda anymore. Groups can adventuring far deeper into tougher zones then
before etc. But I wager a guess that there are plenty of lvl70 people
then who would sitting in BoT at the crossroad afraid of going any
further in.
