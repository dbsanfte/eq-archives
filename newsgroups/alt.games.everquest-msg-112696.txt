Decided to try making jewelry, bought a jewelry kit and some
inexpensive metal.  Have not bought any jewels yet, most are fairly
expensive, so before I do I thought I would ask for advise.  Is there
anything I need besides a kit, like a recipe book perhaps ?  Do you
try to get your metal enchanted by someone ?   Any suggestions or
advise appreciated.   Don't want to waste my hard earned pp on
mistakes.  :)     TIA.
