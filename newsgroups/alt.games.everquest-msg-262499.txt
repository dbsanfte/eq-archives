Define what you mean by Corporate welfare.  Like WalMart's
sub-standard wages?  Or something else?

I don't agree with that plan by him or anyone else.  It *is* Just
Plain Wrong.  I have a different solution in mind but that's for
another day I think.

2 parts.  Part the first, I agree.  Children often get the short end
of every situation because they have no voice of their own, legally.
I'm all for healthcare for children, the parents of these children in
many cases can rot for all I care.  Not all, but many.
Part the second, Republicans don't like Clinton.  Just like Democrats
don't like Bush, facts of life.  But on the less emotional side I
don't like the idea of Socialized medicine.  I know there's arguments
for both sides but the few people I have talked to in countries that
have this wish they did not.  The ones with money come here, the ones
that without don't.  But they also wait 6 months for a MRI, so I'm
told.  Also, it doesn't attract the more talented people in most
cases.  I work with a guy who was a Doctor in another country.  He
came here to work as a Network Engineer because it paid better.
Whether he was good or not I don't know, but it speaks to the
incentive.  I know, "Helping People" should be what it's all about but
that isn't reality.  Helping people while making money is.

I can't speak for Republican's per se but my view on children is
fairly stated above.  Do what we can for the children and sterilize
the parents to avoid further suffering.  Obviously this applies to
those that have children with no thought to them, not people who have
simply fallen on hard times.  I have an in-law that uses abortion as a
form of birth control, or at least did (haven't seen her in a while).
12 abortions in 3 years, she shoulda been sterilized from the first.
This is not an isolated or even unique case.  Talked with a few people
at Planned Parenthood and they said it's more common than anyone would
believe.

No argument, but the simple fact is it's not a right.  No gray area,
it's not.  Is it advantageous?  Of course.  Should we as a nation do
what we can to support it?  Yes.  Is it a Right?  No.  People forget
that simple, yet important distinction.  Eventually everything becomes
a Right if that happens.  I've sat in Traffic Court and heard people
tell the judge, when she suspended their license, that they have a
right to drive.  Riiiiiight.

They are black and white.  People want to make them not which is
confusing to me.  It either is or it isn't, very simple.  I'm open for
situational hypotheticals to test the theory, but so far I've not
found one.  Not saying the answers are easy, they're just black and
white.
