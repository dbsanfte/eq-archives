I have a  Vehement Sword of Reihijal (forgive spelling)
I believe it has a combat effect??
I am level 36 Paladin.
Occassionally I get the message, "your will is not sufficient to command
this weapon" or something like?

Would this be the occassions when weapon would proc?

and therefore..

Does this mean that my 2hs skills are not high enough? (168)
If so, do they need to be maxed to proc weapon?

Does this mean my stats are not high enough?
If so, what stat affects the weapon  in order to make it proc?

Does this mean my level is not high enough?
If so, what level would I need to be?
I dont remember seeing a required level on the weapon stats...

Thank you.
