I am not saying it is not a disadvantage that those spawns are in range
of the zone in. However, if those zones were camped, it would be a
trivial disadvantage, no worse than the fact that Seb is out of the way
or that the spiders in velks drop no plat.

Every so often, you zone in and die, but you quickly get a res from one
of the many clerics in the zone, so no big deal.

Die without a cleric in your group in an uncamped dungeon, and you have
to call in a big favour from a cleric, or eat the exp.
