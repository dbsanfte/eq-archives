My Iksar Monk is now lvl 15 and I've been thinking about the Shackle of Rock
Quest, specifically the travelling to Timorous Deep and the Oasis of Marr and
there's a few things I'd like to know. Specifically, how does an Iksar get from
The Overthere to the Oasis of Marr without getting severely splattered in the
process? Is there anyone who I can trade with, either in the Oasis of Marr or
the Deserts of Ro, when I get there? How do I return to Kunark in one piece?
And, lastly, are Tarantula's a better source of spider silk than Bonebinders?

Thanks in advance. :)
