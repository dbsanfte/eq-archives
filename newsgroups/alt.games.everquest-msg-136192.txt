You think the term "homophobe" is applied to the "politically
correct"?

I'm guessing here that you don't know what the word originally meant,
or the context it was used in.   *If* you are concerned with
etymology, then "homosexual" is as much a misnomer as "homophobe".
Either use both words with their current usage, OR use both in the
strict original definition, just be consistent.

I seriously doubt you speak for a whole province.  Even if Section 33
of the Charter is used, it has a maximum effect of five years.  You
really feel its worth the hassle, just to extend the status quo for 5
more years?   Think of the precedent here- we are talking about a
province suspending some of the rights given under the Charter.   That
opens the door for any of Sections 2 and 7-15 to be suspended later.
Some of these rights include:

- freedom of religion, thought, beleif, opinion, freedom of the press,
assembly and association (Section 2)
- the right to life, liberty, security, fundamental justice (Section
7)
- the right to be secure from unreasonable search or seizure (Section
8)
- your rights on arest (Section 10) and the right not to be
arbitrarily detained (9), as well as your rights if you are charged
with an offense (11)
- the right to be free of cruel and unusual treatement (12)
- freedom from prosecution based on your testimony (13)
- the right to an interpreter in a legal proceeding (14)
- the right to be equal under the law, protection from discrimination
(15)

So, just because you object to gay marriage, you want Alberta to
invoke Section 33 so that it can ignore the provisions made in Section
15.   Look at the list above!  Can you honestly tell me you are
willing to see the precedent set for the removal of any or all of
those rights?

Many, many, years ago (10 years?) the Supreme Court ordered the
addition of sexual orientation to the prohibited grounds for
discrimination in Section 15 of the Charter.  Some time later
Parliament passed a bill explicitely adding the words to the Charter.

With me so far?

So, in order to overturn this ruling the Supreme Court would have to
(a) accept the appeal, if there is one, (b) find that the current
marriage laws are not in violation of Section 15, a logical
impossibility, or (c) find that the discrimination, in this case, is
acceptable under Section 15(2) or is otherwise justifiable.

The federal goverment is taking this much more seriously than you.  As
of a press release dated yesterday, they are considering four
different options.  One of them is abandonning federal recognition of
marriage entirely and leaving marriage to be a religious institution.
That would, presumably, mean that instead of the current three-tiered
system (single, common-law, married) we would now have a two-tiered
system (single, common-law).  I would guess that they are seriously
considering this option- why else comment on it, and not the other
three options they are considering?

I use to have a paper copy of the executive summary, but that's long
gone.  I'm sure you know how to use the 'net if you really want to
find it!   I'm guessing early 90's.... there's only one report per
year, so it should not be hard to find.

So you condone cruetly to animals as well as weakening the rights of

I gave 4 difference examples where same-sex spousal recognition could
SAVE the government money.... do you not have any real reply to that?

Thinking present, since I have had a spouse by law since Jan. 1, 2001.
I could have said "the guy who was my boyfriend at the time and is now
my spouse".

No, its not bullshit, you just don't want to beleive it.  If saving
money is so imporant to you and you think that's the gov't priority,
why no stop funding health care, education, farm subsidies....

Ah yes, god forbit we make people feel warm and fuzzy!   I'll skip the
debate regarding your 4% figure, at least until the census data is
out.   Its a moot point anyway- even if the figure was as low as 4%,
you're talking about 1,240,000 Canadians!
