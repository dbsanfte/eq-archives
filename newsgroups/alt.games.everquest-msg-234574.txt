I'm unclear on why your healers are in AE range on 
wind?

9 people running 13 characters, one of them a 3rd box
chanter buff bot (no charm pet for him). 

IIRC 65 sk, cleric, 'chanter (all one person), 65
ranger, cleric (one person), 62 BL, 65 Mage (one person)
65 warrior, 65 druid, 65 necro, 65 mage, 65 wizard
and one other I'm not remembering.

4 healers, both mobs unslowed, at least one mage charm pet
on each, no deaths.  Dealing with his AE's for healers
should be easy - Ours stayed out of ae range with ease.
Of course, on those 2 and the Guardian of the Seal (which
we did the same day, the healers don't use CH.

The tank breaks 9k with full raid buffs - but had to 
make do with SV instead of BSS and Kragg/IoS instead
of Focus/Boar - can't remember his exact HP that day
but it was high 8k.

So, at the level of 2 groups, no slower and 2clerics,
2 druids as healers - there wasn't any noticeable
difference in difficulty.

I have to assume the difference is that, more healers
allowed us to use long range-non-CH heals and the healers
never got in AE range.  3 of those healers (at least)
were >FT10 at the time.  I don't know about the fourth.

In fact, only the warrior and SK fought in AE range - 
the pets need to be healed once during the fight, but 
it's pretty easy to pull them out, heal and send them in.
Charm pets don't need to be healed at all.  (BTW -
the BL didn't melee because yours truly was devoting all
his attention to the charm pet and nuking)
