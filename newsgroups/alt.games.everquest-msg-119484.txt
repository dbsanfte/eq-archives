I don't know. I haven't been around as long as you have. I started Feb.
2001, so it was probably before my time.

I forget how much the stones cost... it's around 15 pp, if my memory is
correct. 5 charges of Nullify Magic but with a cast time. So it doesn't
really help a non-caster if he's getting beaten on.

My guess is that as the people that were using the stones got higher, and as
a new influx of people came in, the information just wasn't passed on.
Self-preservation on the part of the original pumice users?
