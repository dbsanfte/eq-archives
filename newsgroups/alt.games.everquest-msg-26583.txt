That's what root is for. :-)

2 golems: try to dazzle the one that the tank isn't beating on.  If
it's immune (i.e. 53+) it will chase you.  Get a bit of distance and
root it.  Slow it so that when root breaks you can re-root easily
without taking much damage.

3+ golems: aoe mez.  Hope that not too many are 53+.  For the ones
that resist, see above.


Most casters get some form of root, though you may have to
remind/educate them that root is a great spell for crowd control. 
Hellooooo Paladin!  Also, root is a lot less mana than mez.

You also have to educate party members that if a golem is pounding on
them, and someone says "rooted", that they need to move away from it. 
We've been trained from level 35 or so that we're supposed to stand
still and let the enchanter/warrior mez/taunt the mob of the others. 
Now we're afraid to take evasive action.

The Hole is a fun zone.  It's just a bit different from other zones,
so we have to adapt different tactics.
