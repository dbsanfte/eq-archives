If so, then song haste sucks even more than previously thought.  67% haste, easily
achieved with a 22% haste item and a 45% haste spell  would be boosted to 82%
haste with Battlecry if its a straight 15% add, but only to 77% if its a %
multiplier.  Since the haste cap prevents a haste total over (is it 100?  I've
heard other suggestions but lets say yes) only with the best item+haste combos
would the 15% ever live up to its potential, the multiplied boost would never end
up being larger than the listed %.  These percent boosts are small enough already
that I'd be really dissapointed to find that they are worse than I previously
supposed.

Ah, just like other normal song hastes that fall in the "spell haste" category, in
fact JWW is the lowest level bard self only song haste.  This would mean it DOES
stack with "song haste", then.  Kevin's description was a bit hard to follow, and
I was trying to guess at a way the interactions would work as I thought he was
saying.  On re-reading it, yes, if the fists create a  "spell haste" type song
effect, this would work as he says.   And the effect would seem to stack with
chanter/shaman hastes, but in fact the haste part would fail to do so.

Slow stacking would seem to be a much bigger issue, and interesting across all
levels of the game (well all levels from where a bard gets his first slow song
that is; level 20 for a PBAoE, 23 for the more useful single target/snare version)
