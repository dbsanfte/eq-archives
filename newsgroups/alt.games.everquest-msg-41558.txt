There are plenty of people who are calling for anything up to, and
including, nuking Afghanistan into oblivion.  Which is another capability
that we do have.  Personally, I think that Bin Laden needs to be taken out,
regardless of his involvement in this particular act of terror, but then I
thought that before this particular act as well.  The Taliban needs to be
removed from power for harboring and abetting terrorists.  I do not,
however, advocate indiscriminate bombing of Afghanistan.
