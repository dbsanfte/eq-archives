Just go to the Nexus and port down to NK.  Or get a SOW from your Shaman
teammate and run to PAW.

Even before POP came out, Druids hit a roadblock once they were into their
upper 40s.  Clerics could heal better, Wizards could port better and nuke
better, and Shamans got canabalize to restore mana.  Druids, for the most
part, turned into farmers once they got near level 50.  I never saw a Raid
group that were in their 50s EVER asking for a druid to tag along.
