I recently bought a lizzymount for soloing with my pally. The thought was to
get mana because of the medding-state ur character is in while being on the
back of a mount. But I recently noticed that while in attackmode i dont
regen mana very quickly (Which actually sounds pretty fair). Can anyone
verify this or is it just my imagination?
Ive also noticed a serious decrease in manaregen when moving from place to
place on my lizzymount. Is moving the same as being in attack mode regarding
the manaregen-rate?

Ab, 59 Pally

PS. although I at first was very dissapointed to find out about this, i
actually see a little use for it anyways. Although pulling on a mount is a
bitch, i get SOME manaregen, while looting and casting....dont know if this
was worth the money spent on the mount, though ;o)
