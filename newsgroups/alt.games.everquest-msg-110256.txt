  I'm pretty sure that's why too, but it still doesn't explain why the rafts
pause when they zone into Oasis or North Ro.  I mean, come on... the coast
is within visual range.  It's not exactly a crisis if somebody gets dumped
in the water there and it'd shave a few minutes off each trip.

  Also, I have one really slow zoning friend, and one time the boat began
moving before he had zoned in (I know when he zoned in because I was grouped
with him and I was watching his health bar) and he ended up on the boat just
fine.
