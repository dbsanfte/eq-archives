I play on Firiona Vie if that makes a difference for this problem.

After I upgraded to the Luclin add-on I had some strange behavior during my
language learning session.  First the (legible) color I had changed the
Skill Improvement message to reverted to the default color BUT other skill
improvements like Your Conjuration skill has improved (72) was in my user
defined color.  (As an aside, I can't say how crazy it makes me that
language skill improvements don't display the numerical skill level.  Come
on Verant the language thing is hard enough on FV with out this handicap
too!)

Even more perplexing I was getting the skill improvement messages
intermittently.  Sometimes I'd get it and other times after being spammed
forever I would not get an improvement even though the character in my group
spamming me was at a much higher skill level.  Once I zoned back and forth
after not seeing a skill improvement message for three or four sessions and
when I looked at the language skill in my stats window it had gone from
"Very Bad" to "Bad" - this with no skill improvement message for 4 or 5
zonings.

Bottom line, can anyone shed any light on this.  Now I have 2 languages that
I don't know how far I am from my level cap and another, the very bad one,
that soon will be in the 20 skill point badlands of Below Average and I
can't tell when to tell my instructor to stop spamming!

This is really getting to be unfun!
