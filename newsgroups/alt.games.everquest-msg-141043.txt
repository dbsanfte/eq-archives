In the depths of a cave under the Shattered Hills, is the lair of the hydra!
From here it ravages the lands around, wreaking havoc for miles.
Blumpkin, a warrior from the far North, a barbarian once, now a mercenary
captain between wars, thought this would be an ideal foe, to test his
mettle, and garner fame, he is not subtle, he enjoys the heft of a blade and
the chance to fight a worthy foe.
The gnomish mine nearby had been attacked several times by the brute, and
there he inlisted the aid of Knok, a wizard small by comparison to the
barbarian, but his powers are not to be taken lightly.
The gnome mine was also where they met Cloauk, an elven rogue, jailed for a
rowdy bar fight. The chnace of a quick parole and the gold literring the
watery lair of the monster was soooooo tempting
So the three tracked down, and assaulted the Hydra...
Who will win?
Cloauk has paralyzed one of the horror's necks with arrows dipped in Wyvern
venom.
Knok has entranced one head, while his rune wards and enchantnments of speed
let Blumpkin cleave with fury, and so far, avoided being crunched in the
jaws of death.
People from Poser 3, clothes, armour and textures mostly by myself, rendered
in bryce 5, after work in Paint Shop Pro :)
