If you ping chat.everquest.com from a Command Prompt, you
get the following results:
|Pinging eqlogin1.989studios.com [64.37.148.4] ...

Which made me suspicious that there might be more than one:
|C:\>ping eqlogin2.989studios.com
|
|Pinging eqlogin2.989studios.com [64.37.148.25] ...

If you ping patch.everquest.com, you get:
|Pinging patch.everquest.com [64.37.156.26] with 32 bytes of
data:

I don't know ZoneAlarm, but does it allow you to set up
valid connection to whole subnets (using wildcards in the IP
address, maybe)? It seems that 64.37.*.* or *.989studios.com
would cover all the servers you need to have connections
with for EQ.

How does performance factor in? Presumably ZoneAlarm either
permits the connection or blocks it. If ZoneAlarm weren't
configured properly, you shouldn't be able to access EQ at
all (even to patch).
