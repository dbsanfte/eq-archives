Corpses decay after 7 days if you don't log in during that 7 days.  The 
decay rate is 24hours of play time= 7days online time.  So if you log in 
  8 hours a day over 3 days, your corpse will be gone.

I think it's wrong to have that level of decay when you are using EQIM. 
  They definately need to change that or I'll not use it ever again and 
I'll never pay for it.
