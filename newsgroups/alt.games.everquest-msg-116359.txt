I did that upgrade, but then, I wanted to move my veil and rings on down to
my twink ranger to raise his wisdom for tradeskill purposes, so figured I
may as well upgrade mine while I'm at it.  It does help that I only have to
pay for the ingredients, as we have at least two 250 skill enchanter
jewelers in guild.  I should add, that I offer all of my tradeskill services
to the guild for the cost of ingredients too.
