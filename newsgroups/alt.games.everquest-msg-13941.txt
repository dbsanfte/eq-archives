It was something we both discussed and did research on, I was in contanstant
pain and not a very good partner for shopping, hiking etc. Everywhere we
went people stared and laughed.  My grandmother suggested lipo, we found out
about weightloss surgery.  We found the place that seemed to have the best
program and success rate a program called Pathweighs, in Dallas Texas, I had
a process called a Vertical Banded gastroplasty. More can be read about this
at http://www.weightlossurgery.com/
This is a tool not majik and it requires work. As for what I do I swim and
watch what I eat, so Thank you for your offer for help.
If anyone has any further questions on WLS, feel free to email me at
fred_jan@swbell.net .

Folks Majik and Love Happen, just open yourselves and be a friend, and
Listen.
"It can happen to me, it can happen to you." A song for the
eighties/seventies but I can not remember the name.
