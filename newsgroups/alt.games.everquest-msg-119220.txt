When the rooted Tunare in the forest despawns, she returns to her tree.

This is the reason they stopped it showing what loot she wields - you could
keep popping and poofing her till she wielded what you wanted (she still
pops and poofs.. you just don't see what she has)

We didn't agro Tunare at the start of the raid though, she was agrod when we
pulled her 2 guardians (10minute or so fight for the 2) which were the last
of 3 mobs in the zone.
