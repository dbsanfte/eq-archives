The Shan Tok is much better than what I was using at level 9. I was
still using a Rusty Two Handed Sword (9 50), then at level 10 I
upgraded to a Fine Steel Two Handed Sword (12 43).

It really depends on how much you can afford, but for teens/twenties,
a warrior cannot go wrong with Langseaxes (6 23). To compare, the Shan
Tok usually does 17 damage every 3.9 seconds, or 4.3 damage per
second. The Langseax does 13 damage every 2.3 seconds, or 5.7 damage
per second. That's a pretty big jump in damage output, and the
Langseax is magical for wisps. Also, due to it's speed, you gain skill
increases pretty quickly.

The Langseax is a quest that involves running from Halas to Western
Karana and back, so they might be hard to find in your area. If you
are selling Orc Belts and Sholderpads, you might have enough pp to buy
a Dragoon Dirk, it's also 6 23, with a bonus to dex and vs. magic (I
still keep one in my ranged slot at level 38). They sell for 50-100
pp, usually around 80. Since it drops in Crushbone though, you can
usually get it on the cheaper end. Otherwise, it might make for an
interesting trip to travel to the Qeynos/Blackburrow area and try to
buy one there.
