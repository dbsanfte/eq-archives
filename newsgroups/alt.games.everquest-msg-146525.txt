All of the following assumes the heals go in:

At 54, the number of 'capable healers' skyrockets.  "Hard" camps
are always going to take clerics, whether it's CT or DL with a
lower-level group; druid and shaman abilities simply can't keep
up with the healing demands.  For the "normal" XP camp, there's
absolutely no reason to select a cleric over another priest class.
But druid snare/evac/ports provide a reason to take a druid and
Slow (and a persistant pet "DoT") along with other shaman buffs
provide a reason to take a shaman.

The *ONLY* reason to take a cleric is because you NEED the healing.
That's what they do.  The summoned Hammer changes at 56 along with
Yaulp V provide some balance in "normal" groups by providing some
non-healing benefit to having a cleric there.  Until that level,
though, they NEED the healing bonus to get groups.  And there's
simply not enough "hard" camps to make up the difference and the
ones that do exist are far more likely to have 56+ clerics in them
anyway.

The only thing a 54 and 55 cleric will have that a druid/shaman
won't is rez capability.  That's easily gotten anyway in most
XP zones, especially if you're willing to pay and drag the body
to the cleric.  Assuming there's at least one in zone, anyway. ;)
