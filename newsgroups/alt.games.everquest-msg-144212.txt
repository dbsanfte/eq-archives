Let me preface by stating that I have never even *seen* anyone take on
one of these uber-mobs, so I really am not familiar with the
techniques. However, the Dain strategy you mention here wouldn't
appear to me to be an exploit. I mean, if this were to actually happen
in rl, then wouldn't Dain behave in much the same way, other than
maybe warping down to the monk immediately rather than going out to
the front first? That would seem to be strategy, not exploit.

On the other hand, when the mob adheres to some unreasonable
pathing/action dictated by programming, then the exploit is obvious.

The fact *does* remain that LoS obviously has some pretty big jerks in
their ranks.
