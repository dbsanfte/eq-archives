When you get to higer levels, 30+ say, EVERYONE loves a cleric.

Fun? Err, yes i suppose. We have some spells to play with. Pallys can also
act as fair meatshields since we can taunt pretty well, but against anything
but Undead our damage output is awful.

Be prepared for lots of humiliating derogatary remarks, and trouble finding
groups/getting invited to big events unless you are in a guild raid.
