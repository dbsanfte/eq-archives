The rule of FV is this:
Characters can bind at the Melee bind points.

This is not limited strickly to cities (with soulbinders). You can
aslo bind at the following areas:
Arena in Lake Rathe
North Karana Gypsie Camp
Outside Kaesora in Field of Bone
Zone entrances in Kael (if memory servers)
Ruins in Frontier Mountains
City of Mist
(and a couple of other places I have forgotten about)
