"Diversity Week"...


di+ALc-ver+ALc-si+ALc-ty   Pronunciation Key  (d-v+APs-rs-t, d-)
n. pl. di+ALc-ver+ALc-si+ALc-ties 

The fact or quality of being diverse; difference. 
A point or respect in which things differ. 
Variety or multiformity: +IBw-Charles Darwin saw in the diversity of
species the principles of evolution that operated to generate the
species: variation, competition and selection+IB0- (Scientific American). 



I guess that if you don't believe in PC-BS or the leanings of the
loony left, you don't get to show your diversity...
