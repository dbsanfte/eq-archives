Believe it or not, this is a good weapon to lead with.  I have heard people
that take the first swing with that weapon and get a massive hit and then
quickly switch to their faster less dmg weapon.  Imagine a double hit with
that, you could knock something down quite a bit.  Seems like 50/150 is
really bad, but these innovative people have found a good use.

If you are on Drinal, I'll take it   ;-)
