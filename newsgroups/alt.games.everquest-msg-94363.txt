Not sure why you would do it on the Ring of Fire.  That isn't exactly a 
single group fight for most people.  I know that we have been 
experimenting with different ways to keep aggro on the tank types, but 
we're talking about much lower level mobs than a Ring of Fire encounter.

Oh, I did not know that.  Hmmm, in that case, one of the other rooting 
classes is going to be needed.  Not on this encounter though, since I 
doubt that these are summoning mobs.

Well, he was trying to withstand all 8 of them.  Of course due to the way 
the game is coded, I suspect he can have no more than 4 beating on him at 
a time.  Hmmm, now it gets interesting.  Any high-level warriors want to 
answer this:  Can you taunt more than 4 mobs onto you, and if so, what do 
the 5th and beyond do since they can't attack you?
