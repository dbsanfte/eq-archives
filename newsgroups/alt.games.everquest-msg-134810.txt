Heh, the DA reflex is deceptively hard to master.  By the time you really
start needing it, you have both DA and DB (and have had forever, DB is
what, a level 29 spell?) and 50+ levels of hardly needing them, probably
many of those without even memming them.  Then you start getting up
to where the ability to stop getting hit becomes important... and the (I
still think of this as new) ability to drop back down to the bottom of
the hate list becomes even more important.

DA and DB are on a (18 minute, I think?) recast timer, so you can't throw
them down every time you get nervous.  Use one and you only have
one left... use the second and you become an eggshell waiting for
some mob to step on you.  Use neither, though, when you should
have, and you become an eggshell that someone -did- step on, when
you -could- have been inside a M1 Abrahms instead (anyone see
reign of fire?  GET IN THE TANKS IDIOTS)

DB takes twice as long to cast as DA (and more mana, but by the
time you need to worry about invulnerabilities, you probably will
be hard pressed to tell the difference) so oddly its your spell of
choice; whenever you can see that you need the invulnerability-
and-ditch-aggro effect soon but have a little time you cast DB,
so that the twice-as-good DA remains up.

So there you are.  Hmm, mob hitting me.  How hard?  How fast?
Is it likely to be mezzed soon?  Is it even mezable?  Could I root
it and back off?  Geeze, its been a tenth of a second easy whats
up with that?  Ouch, lookit my HP bar shrink.  Do I have time to
DB?  DA
/1 DA DA DA
whew that was close.  Hmm, can I click DA off yet?
/1 still on DA
ok here goes, DA off,
/1 DA off
/1 CHeal on (( Moneabrahms ))
/1 someone going to heal me?  Got an ouchie here

heh, EQ just finished patching in my background.
