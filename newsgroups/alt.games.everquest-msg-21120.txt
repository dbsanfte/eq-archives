If there are groups there ask first if they mind if U hit them once or cast
a debuff on them, thats all it takes to get the faction. I wouldn't use a
pet unless there are no groups there. Believe it or not on some servers
there sometimes aren't. I play on Sol Ro & I pretty much spent close to 10
levels in the area, I'm including High Keep as well. but after the server
split High Hold Pass is near on deserted now days
