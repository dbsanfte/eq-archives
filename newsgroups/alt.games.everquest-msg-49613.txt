Hi folks,

Are there anyone who have setup a Linux box for ISP sharing to play EQ?

Currently, I have setup a Linux for Internet sharing (by setting IP Masq).
However, when I start an online game called Everquest, it seems that the
performance is very poor because a lot of local HD activity (on my NT
clients) occurred.

Are there approach for troubleshooting the source of problem? Or there are
any parameters can be altered on the Linux server side?

Regards,
  Francis
