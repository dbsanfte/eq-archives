Lovely pictures and nice profiles. First off, I'm missing what your
question is. You already have better gear and stats than one of the 55
wizards in our guild at level 20. I wouldn't sweat it much. (Oh, and
please tell me that necro photo is fake. Were you *really* so tacky as
to ride a horse on a level 20 character into Unrest?)

As to the methodology, I have yet to find an adequately "documentable"
answer to that question. For now, I'm going old school. I have a list of
some big bang for the buck +INT and +Mana items lined up in my near term
future, but as the INT goes up further, I'm going to look to drop some
INT items in other slots in favor of raw +Mana items, unless somebody
can document exactly how the conversion works. And no, I'm not taking
what Magelo says as my true mana pool to determine it, because I don't
know what forumula *they* are using either. 

But since you asked, that's the methodology I'm going with for now. All
INT till a shade over 200, then max raw mana.
