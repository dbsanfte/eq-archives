I still never understand why the OOT zone isn't just represented with the
"right" orientation... why does it always look like you have to travel east
to get to the west???

| I have never seen that map before, it is almost what I was looking for.
The
| map I saw was what looked to be a scanned image of the original cloth map
| that came in the box, and was chopped up and put back together in a more
| exacting representation of how the zones connected.  I enjoyed it for the
| humor factor alone, as the continents were severely misshapen after the
| "corrections"
|
| thank you for your input Jennaii
