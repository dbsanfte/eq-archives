Targetable, but group only.  That's why we pass our shrink-whores
around.

Sorry, was a bit unclear there.  I meant I can't wait until our
Shamans get MGB, so that we can speed up the buff cycle.  When we raid
buff now, we're always waiting on the shaman buffs.  We only have two
active 60 shaman (well, we have a third, but he's west coast, so comes
late), so buffing 30-40 folks with Focus is the bottleneck.  When we
can group hug, mass Aego, mass C3, mass Focus, we'll be able to go
from wipeout to pull in about 10 minutes.

We do have a 59(?) BL in our guild.  The new main of one of our monks.
I'm still not exactly sure what the BL role is in the endgame, but I
love them in exp groups.  I suspect that a well-played BL is a pretty
good crowd-controller for exp grinding at least.
