Had this problem as well. Changed /chatfontsize from 4 back to the default 3
and it went away.
It appears that in chatfontsizes other than the default, the cursor movement
created by hitting the space bar is larger than the area taken up by the
actual space "character".
This is at 1024x768 resolution, YMMV at other resolutions.
