I've heard from friends that a group of all 20s can go in.

I think whats happening here is that the group must be in a close
range of levels to each other, and that the lower the level, the
smaller the range.  Originally, I had heard that everyone had to
be within 10 levels, then later within 7 levels; 
reading this message suggests that at the lower end something
less than 5 levels must be the real range; this is what makes me
suspect a sliding scale.  Thats also in keeping with the "range
to get exp", which is roughly 2/3rds the highest, or half again
the lowest.

It would be handy to find out what exactly the ranges are at
various levels, so we wouldn't spend a lot of time getting groups
together only to find out one or another member doesn't fit in
the range.
