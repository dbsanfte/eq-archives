I *always* have a point...

The problem is, you and your loony friends never acknowledge because
it shows your posts for the lies that they are...

Just FYI, there are much earlier posts from Lesa and BS that are
personal attacks..

I have NEVER, EVER, NOT ONCE went on the offensive and attacked
anyone..  That is a statement that you can take to the bank..

Anyone that I have ever attacked, has always attacked me or my family
first...

As I said, I did not draw first blood...  But when attacked I will
aggressively respond in kind...

If Lesa didn't want this to be a personal attack-fest, then she should
not have started the attacks...

I could make fun of this GNOME thing, but that would be WAY too
easy...  :^)
