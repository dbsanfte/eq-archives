To be a bit more clear... I see no way your joke can work without assuming I
was accusing you of using a sock puppet.   I was not.   It was a simple one
liner.  along the lines of   "The voice of reason!".... "You hear voices?
Thats not exactly good mental health ;)"

In other words, you definitely missed it.    My appologies for not being more
obvious.   Must have forgotten where I was. ; )
