Either it's not a problem on EMarr, or, I just don't hunt anywhere that it 
would be a problem.  In PoN, which is about the only place I solo anymore, 
the only person I have seen doing that was a bard.  Swarm kiting summoning 
mobs.  I have to say, I was very impressed with his ability.  He did have 
to zone out at the hedge eventually when he was completely oom.
