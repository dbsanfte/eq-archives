About a year ago there was some discussion about this issue. The theory at
that time was that you couldn't beg from pets between 120 and 165-70 of the
begging level. Currently my enchanter's skill is 160 and I've just made
level 32. Begining at 120 I had to return to Freeport to practice with
Rebby. I wasn't skilling up up from my pet, but I could with Rebby. As I
just just hit 32 a couple of hours ago I haven't had a chance to learn
whether I can , again , skill up from  my pet.- Redakamai
