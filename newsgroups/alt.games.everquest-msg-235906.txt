Granted if you have turned in thingsin all honesty then you might be
feeling thesting of the nerf bat.  But wahat about the other end of
the scale where people were turning in the giant snake teeth (tooths?)
mentioned earlier and netting 1000's of tribute points.

I know there was (is?) a zone where you can fear mobs into the walls
because of pathing errors (someone out there is bound to know where)
where SoE stated that using that exploit would get you
warned/suspended/banned.

If we all except that this is an exploit that might allow you to kill
some other mobs and get extra xp/pp/items then how is that any
different from intentionally trying to get 1000s from snake fangs?
