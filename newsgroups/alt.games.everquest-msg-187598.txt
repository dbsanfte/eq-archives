Generally, they are idiots.  Over on comp.os.linux.advocacy, someone posts
regular stats that include a list of posters with interesting stats for
each, including number of bytes they posted for the month, and percentage of
lines in their posts that were quoted.  It's quite interesting, and there is
a definite correlation between the people who are idiots and the people who
have a high percentage of quotes (although there are exceptions at either
end).

If someone had enough spare time, those kind of stats for this group would
be intersting.

> PLEASE!!! top post if you can't SNIP!!!!!

No...that's just asking them to make it worse.  That would make it so that
if the thread becomes mixed, with some people top posting, and some people
posting properly, you'll get messages where you have to jump around by huge
amounts if you need to check context.
