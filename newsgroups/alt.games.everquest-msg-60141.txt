Yeah, you're probably right.  I know I quit playing Everquest after my first
couple deaths, quit playing Quake after my first couple deaths, quit playing
Tribes after my first couple deaths...  oh wait, I didn't.

Perhaps the answer *for you* is that you're just too weak-willed for a game
that has some actual (human) intelligence behind the opposition?

It's not an invalid viewpoint.  I'm sure there are plenty of other
weak-willed people that would feel the same way.  I'm equally sure that
there are plenty more that don't feel that way at all.
