I was PLing my rogue in DSP the other night when a friend came by for a 
guild invite.  I invited him and he tossed a SoW on me.

I was using the method of letting my pet almost kill the mobs then mez / 
blur it and let my rogue finish it.  On the Large Zelniaks, I was starting 
my mez cast at about 20-24% health and it would land between 5 and 15% 
health.  On the wolves, I would usually wait until they dropped just below 
20%.

After he left, my pet ended up killing 3 mobs in a row ( compared to none 
previous ), although I didn't change when I did my casts.  I then noticed 
that he had cast a str spell on me along with the SoW.  I assume he did the 
same for my pet, and that is what was increasing his damage output.  I left 
soon after when the rogue hit 39 so I didn't get to see any messages about 
buffs wearing off.
