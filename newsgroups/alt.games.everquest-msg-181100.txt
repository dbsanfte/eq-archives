The pedestals outside cities that look like books are ports to the
Plane of Knowledge. From there, you can port to any starting city,
plus a few other locations using the various stones (each with the
destination's name on it).

The Bazaar is right off the Nexus in Luclin, the zone right by the
Kunark teleport pad. Once you zone in, type /bazaar to bring up the
search interface to shop. Or, buy a trader's satchel off the merchant
int he big building between the banks, load it with stuff to sell,
stand in one of the stalls (Despite what people seem to think, there's
no reason to crowd the very ends of the ones closest to the banks),
then type /trader. Should bring up some text that will explain the
process. Basicly, click each item, set a price, then click the "set
price" button. Once everything's priced, click "Begin Trader" and go
afk for a few hours. ;-p
