Hi all,

I have a 521 Rogue tat has losuy Pickpocklet skills so is way off getting
his epic.  He currently uses a  10/21 Bloodpoint as a primary.  Was in a
group the other day when a 12/27 rogue only piercer dropped which i passed
up.  However given that rogue main damage is from the BS  iwwas wondering
what people thought would be better 'til i get my epic - 12/27 just seems
way too slow but dont know about that extra BS damage?  Have a 13/25 1hs as
secondary.

Thanks
