Rez effects prevent a few buffs from landing, all of the ones that come to
mind buff STR as one component.

No cleric buff other than perhaps reckless strength and the clicky off the
initiate's symbol of brell is stopped by the rez icon.

In no way is the HP granted by any cleric buff reduced if your target has
his rez icon on.  In fact, the buff will serve as a partial heal, giving
not only a higher max HP, but a higher current HP.  Your just rezed friend
has a higher life expectancy buffed than without.  Of course a heal would
be nice too.

Further, if you have just rezed someone in your group (as opposed to just
being nice to strangers) you might as well get the buffing done right
away, so you can be medding up while your target is recovering, instead of
waiting for the effects to wear off, THEN spending mana so he has to wait
for you to med  back up to a ready state.

Any buff that you can get to stick over top of the rez icon will work this
same way; there's no benefit I can think of to waiting.  A side benefit of
buffing with the icon up is that this automatically leaves buff slot one
open for an instaclick icon, once the rez wears off.
