It wasn't, at least not directly.  I just overloaded on the

anyway.

You drag a spell gem to the hotkey pad so you can cast it
with one key stroke or so that it's bigger and easier to
click with the mouse.

True enough.   Of course, switching targets to someone outside
your group is most likely going to be hotkey'd in some manner,
either for /assist healing and/or simple "MT Down, heal SMT"
situations.  Its fairly easy to keep the mouse in that area of
the keyboard and just click.   You're going to need the mouse
anyway, might as well put it to as much use as possible.
