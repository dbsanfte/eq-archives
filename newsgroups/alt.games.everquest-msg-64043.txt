I had my folder open so I highlighted the 101 changed filez after "Z"

Its 101 files patched, or in the case of ini and such altered,  for a
total of 24.6 meg.

Yeah you can run testeverquest.exe, go to advanced and select regular
server. The diff at the moment between the test server file set and
regular is only like  2 small files anyway so really it doesn't
matter, you'll just patch those when you run regular Everquest.exe and
they allow you to patch.
