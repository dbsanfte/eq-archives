That's beautiful!

I wonder if they couldn't find enough volunteers to to this at
relatively little cost.  Make it a multi-pass filtering operation
with names to be examined by X volunteers, with Y "rejected" tags
being required to make the list that's reviewed internally.  A bit
of auto-filtering to reject the lists from "defective" volunteers
(those who reject all names, or every third name, or whatever)
could keep the process reasonably clean.  That would be so nice,
to actually have an auto-reject filter that nailed most of the
"invalid" names.  Add a name generator that worked well, and that
didn't offer the players names that couldn't pass the "invalid"
filter, and a long time irritation would be greatly mitigated.
