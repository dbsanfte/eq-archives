Well... they're out there, but I haven't found one I'd recommend.  It 
seems like one of those things where it's just massively easier to have 
someone -show- you how the parts go together instead of reading about it.

}(And in all seriousness, what's an ATX case?)

Umm.  The good kind.  If your computer runs luclin, the tower it's in is 
in all probablility an ATX case.  ATX refers to what kind of power supply 
is stuck in it.  It can be distinguished from the old (AT) style power 
supply by whether it has one connector or two to hook to the motherboard.  
And it's pretty vital to get the right kind of power supply for your 
motherboard.

No, on a decent computer, it's only sufferably slow.
