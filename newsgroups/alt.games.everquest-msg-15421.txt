Your underlying assumption seems to be that gaining levels is not fun. I
won't bother to try and understand that.

And calling me level mad is rather amusing. Trying to insult someone based
on what you perceive their viewpoint to be (without knowing any facts) is
sad.

Sorry, have to disagree. If someone ebays or powerlevels, then they have no
accomplishment. If you do it yourself, that is different. The simple fact
is that getting up to level 50 is a trivial undertaking. You don't feel any
pride in getting your 10th character to level 2 do you? No, because it is
meaningless.

It all depends on what you want out of it. People with a whole variety of
desires from the game have fun in the high end area. Maybe its not for you,
and you can go play a new game, or start a new character. Don't presume
that people who don't enjoy the same things as you are somehow inferior to
you.

Sounds like you play on a crappy server. Can't blame the game on what the
people decide to do with it.

>Leveling is uninteresting, 

To you. Allow the rest of the world to hold a different opinion if they
choose to.

>loot camping is excruciatingly boring,

It can be. All depends on who you are with. My enjoyment of the game is
entirely dependant on who I am with, and who is online. 

>"uber"-guilds are typically pathetic collections of little hitlers and

Its like public attitude about crime in the US. Because nightly news
broadcasts focus on the bad, it is all that people think happens. Lots of
good goes on too, just you never hear about it. Violent crime in the US has
plummeted in the last several years...but people still perceive there to be
a great deal of it.

You BELEIVE that uber guilds are like this. Some are. Many are not.

>as far as I can tell the fun part of the game

To you. Allow the remainder of the world to hold a different opinion if
they choose to.

>Heh, just re-read that, sounds bitter, but it's not. 

No, it is not bitter. It is narrow, ill-informed, and prejudiced.
