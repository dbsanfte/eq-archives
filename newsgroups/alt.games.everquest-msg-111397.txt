Umm, no this is wrong.  They do not allow people to move to blue
servers from Test.

As for the infamous "wipes", well they don't happen.

ONCE, like 2 years ago, they did a wipe because there was way too much
cheating by people with GM access on Test, ie buffing your friends,
giving out ridiculous eqpt, etc.  There was such a huge backlash that
they restored all charcters and only did an item wipe.   There has
NEVER been any kind of wipe since then.
