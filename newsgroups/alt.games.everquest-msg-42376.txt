Not positive, but I believe madmen and gypsies share silent faction with
Dervs.  If you haven't killed any dervs, you can sell to the gypsies in
Oasis as an erudite necro, do the concordance of research etc. 

Madmen are all indifferent to my necro.  the hermit you refered to is
Jonah, hence the confusion by the previous posters, as there is a mob in
South Karan named the Hermit.  Jonah's experience will start slowing
down for you shortly, however the Hermit in SK should be able to take
you from 20, through 29.  He is often camped so be careful.
