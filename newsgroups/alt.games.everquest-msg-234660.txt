I'm trying to master the art of chewing off my leg an bandagin it back on.
My other party members think I'm quite mad, but it's nice not to be
desperate for mana regen, as I am with my cleric, and to be able to summon a
doggy that cleans up the greenies (looking forward to soloing the warrens in
a few level, and watching the factional messages pile up... this works best
if you can heal/buff some one lower level, who runs about generating a
ginormous train... eventually they decide to snack on you, then run, and
call others in, and the whol thing snowballs, and so long as your pet isnt
snared or rooted, he does pretty well.

I like faction. I read that a shaman maxed some cabilis factions a long time
ago by standing in a bandit cave and going afk for a few days. I have read
they rewrote the rules to stop people doing that, but it would have been
nice. It's not easy to max factions without area effect weapons or pets, but
i once got an iksar monk to ally with the wood elf guards, although that was
nerfed, alas.

All i can say is, i wish they'd let you hand in a stack of bone chips rather
than 4 at a time for the bone chip quests. I'd be farming kurns all night.
I'm a sucker for that quest ding hehehe!

Can't wait to canni 2.

Anyone got any suggestions for shamans in LDON? I presume buff before you go
in, then slow/heal/bash everything in sight? Not much time at medding? Still
trying to get the courage for an adventure; the stacks of bodies outside the
entry points just put me off ;-)
