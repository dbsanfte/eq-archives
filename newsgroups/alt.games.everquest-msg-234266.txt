Yeah... if there is someone in the zone he's probably camping geos.

If theres two people in the zone one of them is waiting for the other
one to leave so he can camp geos.

If theres more than 2 people in the zone people won't bother sticking
around... they'll pop in say "camp check"... get the "Stay away from
MY geos" instaresponse, and leave again.

whole room to repop before there is a chance the named will spawn on
