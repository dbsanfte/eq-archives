There is the one dwarf vendor inside the windmill who is not KOS to
Iksars and you can buy/sell from him; he doesn't sell
food/drink/bandages, though, so you should stock up on them first.
(the other Erudite character inside the windmill isn't KOS to Iksars
either so you don't have to worry about him; I believe he's a quest
NPC).

As an aside, I know one player who was an Iksar monk who made a nice
little profit offering to run to Cabilis and buy food/drink/bandages
for non-Iksars who didn't want to have to run back to FV/OT! :-)
