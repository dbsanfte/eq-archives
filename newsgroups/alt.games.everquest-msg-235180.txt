Tribute Masters taking a break

Your local tribute masters are taking a short vacation.  It seems that after
only two days of collecting tribute and granting favor, they are already
worn out.  They will also be in closed door discussions, at their secret
retreat, to re-evaluate the amount of favor granted for items.  Look for
them to return prior to this weekend.

I was wondering if they might be skimming from the tribute.  Now we know,
they are vacationing on the items we gave them.  My guess would be the
Italian Riviera, though a few of them may get odd looks from the locals.
