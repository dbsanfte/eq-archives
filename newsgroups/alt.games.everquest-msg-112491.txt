    I'm not showing attitude here, I'm using numbers for illustrative
purposes only.

    We've killed Grieg with as few as 25 people. The difficult part of
fighting him isn't his damage output, which isn't that big. It's his AoE,
which can be kept off the squishy casters with good positioning, and the
adds, which we Dictate and use to add to our damage output. The problem a
smaller guild would have would be keeping enchanters who are Dictating alive
(ours are a bit more robust), and keeping mana levels up for healers for an
entire fight. I believe a lesser guild could take him down with big numbers
and the same solid game plan we use.

    There's even mobs to practice on in the zone, in terms of getting used
to the difficulty. The Servitor should give you an idea of how tough the
melee can be, and has fair drops. There's also a warrior-usable (if your
warrior is a race that can also be a necromancer) 13/20 1HS with 15 STR and
80 HPs that drops off a very easy mob in Grieg's (we're talking flurries a
bit, doesn't hit over 200 and only doubles - just has a boatload of HPs). We
do the guy that drops the 1HS with 12 people, so I KNOW you could take him
down.

    Hmm. So they won't drop everything to get a weapon to improve a warrior,
but they will drop everything to get a piece of a weapon that's just as
good? :-)

    I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I wish they weren't called
"epics". People attach a lot of meaning to the weapons beyond their
functionality, and in my opinion too much meaning. Although the lightsabres
do look cool. :-)

    Sort of like a green scale! ;-)

    After you look them up, I'm sure some you'll say "oh hell no", like the
drops off the Statue of Rallos Zek. But some of these mobs aren't too tough
(no AoE), and should in theory be doable with numbers.
