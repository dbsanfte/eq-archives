Star Wars never turned me on.  I'd much rather play in the
Star TREK universe; I'll probably ignore SWG.  But I prefer
fantasy settings with elves, orcs & wizards, etc. Yo ho! ;-)

One thing that surprises me is that no one has picked up the
Tolkien franchise, once owned by Sierra.  As I recall, Sierra
was scheduled to introduce their "Middle Earth" MMORPG just
about the time that EQ went live, but the project died for
unexplained reasons, (financial difficulties?).  I would have
thought that this year, or next would have been the ideal time
to introduce such a game using the Middle Earth setting.
The massive advertising campaign and huge publicity being
generated by the movies might tempt a lot of Tolkien fans and
curious first timers to try the online gaming experience.
