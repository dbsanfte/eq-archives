Harsh? You very well might be right. But first he says:

"I was a bit angry by now and stupidly warn the guys that I will train a red
mob onto them and Feign Death. They informed me it was bannable (I knew, but
was seriously considering it. I doubt you get banned first offence)."

Then, just posts later, he announces:

"btw as an aside, i got a few norrathian 2nd hand car dealers in my notebook
who i will most definately be training (PCs who rip you off for things like
Words). nothing childish about that imo. i wont be giving them evidence to
petition with beforehand of course."

This is the kind of person we *don't* want playing the game. He clearly
thinks it's okay to train people and leave them dead ... and he doesn't
think it's childish or wrong! Bad, bad, bad, and the more that kind of stuff
becomes rampant and accepted (thankfully, on my server I've encountered
little to none of it) the worse off the game environment will be.

Yeah, I hope he gets caught and banned.
