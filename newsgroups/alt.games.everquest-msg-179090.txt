We actually have a "caster upgrade raid" scheduled tomorrow that will 
either be in UP, at the Generals in TM, or at the Efreet ( now that it was 
suggested ).  The location will be based on who can make it.  As of now, no 
clerics are signed up so UP is out and TM may be out, too.

Wow, never seen her before.  Sounds great.  I'll read up on it.

Another moment of embarassment.  I have one of these.  Or, had.  I did the 
damned quest ( twice ), so I have no idea where it went.  Very odd.  Thanks 
for reminding me.
