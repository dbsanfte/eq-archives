Well, that's what I've been doing. Moving on, I mean. (obviously, since I
can read anything bu English and Spanish and a bit of French) I wasn't mad,
just curious. And yes, I know that the internet is the "global community",
but how much sense does it make to post something in a language which hardly
anyone reads?  Is anyone going to read or reply to the thread? I haven't
noticed that anyone has, in this particular NG. (shrug) Guess that was my
only point.

thanks,
Dark
