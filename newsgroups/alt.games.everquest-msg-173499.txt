Oh!  Well EXCUSE me!  You were in America 8 days ago so you couldn't
possibly be anti-American!  Yeah, in case you didn't know, we have Neo-Nazis
here, just as one example.  We DO have anti-Americans here... just because
you live here or you've been here does not necessarily mean you're not
anti-American.  Sorry.  Good try though.

Read your history books moron.  We were out of the depression long before
WWII.  Actually we experienced a good deal of economic difficulties and
lowering of the standard of living *because* of WWII.  We were able to
recover fairly easily afterwards, but it certainly did *not* make us rich,
you idiot.

Care to offer any particular reasons he's a idiot?

"Sir, there's a man behind you swinging a tire iron at your head, would you
like me to stop him?"

"You, sir, are a fucking idiot."
