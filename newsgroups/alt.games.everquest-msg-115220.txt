I'd like to see a raid where every melee had legs. Oh, wait, every
melee *does* have legs. That means they are capable of walking to the
exit. You know, just like they walked in.

Sure, anyone who can port should take a groupful of people out with
her when she goes. Nothing wrong with that expectation. But to bind in
the dungeon just to play bus driver for the entire raid? No, sorry,
that's not a reasonable expectation.

Maybe the raid leaders should make a bit more of an effort to invite
enough TP capable classes to carry out the folks who are too lazy to
walk. 

In another post you made a reference to "the large number of druids
compared to every other class". Looking at my logs from the Vox raid I
was on last night, there were 37 people in zone for the raid at one
point. Guess how many of us were druids? One - me. The guild leaders
were keen for getting more enchanters, and understandably so, but at
no time did I see someone say "hey, we've only got one druid, maybe we
should put out a call for a few more".
