I agree with most of what you mentioned, but these days a pre-built 
stands a very good chance of being a bit cheaper than going through 
yourself and spec'ing all the components to high standards yourself. The 
performance of the end result won't be huge if you buy the right pre-
built system. I've built several PC's using top of the line parts only to 
see a good friend buy a Dell, for instance, paying less buy getting 
nearly the same level of performance.

Also, being in the IT field myself, it took me a while to fully realize 
that there is a very large number of people who love to play games but 
don't know the first thing about hardware. They are certainly better 
served buying an adequately-performing pre-built.
