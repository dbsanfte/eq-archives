There could be a couple of *very* unlikely circumstances where the acct.
key could be called into question, or the fact that the account was
transferred comes to light. And in one of those *RARE* cases, then yes,
VI would likely just ban the account. 

If you have the cash and want to be totally paranoid, there's a simple
solution. Take the account you bought (assuming you still have the
original box, discs, and most importantly, acct. key #) and reactivate
it. Or, if you don't have all that, shell out the money to buy a new
one. Make SURE you set up the account with the same billing information,
contact info, and name as the one you are currently using. (i.e the
friend's former account.) Then, once that is done, simply transfer the
primary characters over to the new account. If all the account and
billing information is the same, the characters come over fully equipped
and you lose nothing. Voila'! Now you have an account where you have the
only record and full knowledge of all the account info.  At your
leisure, you can trade off, pass over, etc. any remaining crap on the
previous account, then cancel it. That should make you bulletproof in
this scenario. However, again, I think the odds of you getting caught in
your current situation are pretty low unless you do something severely
stupid.
