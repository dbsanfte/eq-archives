Denigrating someone for picking a goal in the game and working
aggressively toward it is a bit whiny.  There's no accounting for fun,
indeed, and if you prefer work or school to EQ, or think people will give a
fuck whether you were there that day, I congratulate you.

It's not an incredible feat.  It's a GAME.  Reports of interesting things done
in the game are appreciated (by me), especially when good statistics are
kept as to how it was done and what it says about the game. 

I found the information VERY useful, both as an indication that the levels
don't get progressively worse, and that AAXP isn't insanely worse at 70 than
it was at 65.

Personally, I'm annoyed that the new levels were added.  Levelling has
never been all that fun as a goal for me, but being lower level than my
compatriots and unable to contribute well to whatever we're doing is so
annoying that I pretty much have to do it or leave the game.  I'm torn as
to whether to grind it out in otherwise boring camps, so I can get back
to the fun I've had in the last year or so at level 65 with no major
stress, and able to contribute wherever our group goes.
