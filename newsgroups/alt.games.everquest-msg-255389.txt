Feh. Casual players have been threatening that since before Kunark.

And considering SOE has consistently been bending over backwards for
the ungrateful casual gamers from Luclin on, I find your conclusion
highly questionable.

No. Casual players should appreciate what they have more than they do.

No, it's actually quite a bit worse in some respects... but it was the
changes put in to placate the ungrateful casual gamers that CAUSED
much (but definately not all) of the decline.

Apparently you don't actually want any changes for casuals at all -
you just want to nerf raiders.

And someone had the gall to say it WASN'T jealousy?

One of my two accounts has an activation date of March 19, 1999.
Everything about the "modern" game is easier by several orders of
magnitude from when I started. So suffice it to say I find this
challenge simply illustrates just how out of touch the casuals are -
they don't appreciate what SOE has done for them, and because of that
I find it unlikely giving them more would do anything but lower the
bar for their complaining even further.

SOE would give these whining casual powergamers what they want and
next thing you know they'd be asking for more solo content, why can't
people solo for gear as good as the raiders and groupers, it should be
possible to one group all the way to GoD endgame, raiders get exp
faster so casual players should get an exp bonus because they can play
less....

...it never ends. It never has.
