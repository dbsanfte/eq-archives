This worked like a charm... with some unexpected results.

I happily ran my young bard around with the constant reminder
that I was too pathetic to actually be able to sense which
way I was heading, and the still rare (but at least I didn't have to
work for it) sense heading skill up.

Funny was the occaisional mysterious appearance of a bite
to eat or a little bit of drink on my cursor (tied the right turn to
forage)

Then I switched in my little druid to help out a friend who needed
to wander around SK killing things and hoping I'd pop her
monk quest shamen on track.  Since I was on autofollow I noticed
nothing out of the ordinary for a while... but then we got in a fight, I
broke AF, and suddenly I was trying to SOW the mob.  Trying to
DS the mob.  SOW, DS, SOW, DS.... whats going on?

Oh wait.  9 and 10 slots on this hotkey sheet are dedicated to those
buffs!  I never use them, and don't use the view where I can see
those hotkeys, but I set them up once while fooling around and
there they are waiting to bite me in the butt.

Aparantly (and I already knew this from moving the autoattack
key to the = button) those new assignments for the hotkeys are
not just for my bard, but for -all- my characters!

Haven't run my cleric since changing, but thats where the trouble is
going to be, he actually -uses- all ten hotkey slots.  Can't have
him trying to click Donals arms or Thurg Legs every time he wants
to steer!
