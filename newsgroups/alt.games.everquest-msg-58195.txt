Anything but human.

Dark elves (well, female ones) look best, but have the faction
difficulties...go agnostic and you will largely be non-KOS in any city of
great importance.

Magician is one of the few classes where your race plays no part. Just that
humans really suck, and at nighttime it is like running around your house
at full speed with a sack over your head. Yes, magicians can make
coldstones, but do yourself a favor and don't be a human.
