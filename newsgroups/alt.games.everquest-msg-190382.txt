Hehe, my rogue was the first on the server to make small wis deitys, had 
monopoly of the market for 2 months before someone else started making 
it. Really dont know why though, since pottery to the level to make them 
took under 100pp, and 1 hour of work :).
Financed my other tradeskills with that money, 250 tailor now :)
