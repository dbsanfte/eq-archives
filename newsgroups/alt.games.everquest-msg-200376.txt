    There's a variety of tricks that can be used. I'll use as my example a
well-known six-boxer, Sam Deathwalker on Sullon Zek. He runs four wizards,
an enchanter, and a cleric all at once. He has one keyboard that sends
signals to all six computers. Each character has a different setup on
hotkeys so that the characters "assist" one another. For example, by
pressing the number "1" the enchanter will mez his target (slow-casting),
the cleric will assist the enchanter and stun the target, and the four
wizards will assist the enchanter and nuke the target. By setting up his
hotkeys right, he can make it look like the characters are working in
unison.

    Other people use other devices, like programmable joysticks, or just
have multiple keyboards. But I can't imagine anything for six characters
other than what I just described.

    Well, it's not perfect. One Sullon Zeker told a delightful tale of
attacking Sam's bot army and watching them turn and nuke one of their own
wizards to cinders. ;-)
