Didn't say they *wouldn't*. Said "doesn't *have to*". If you have the
ability to solo to sixty, you won't be quite as hindered by your rep as
somebody in a class or situation where you *must* have a full guild's
support to get there with any level of success. (i.e. rogues. Don't see
many rogues soloing past 50.) This is not to say that a soloist can't
care about their rep. But if you're the type to just be an asshole and
piss on everyone 24/7, you damn well better be able to solo if you want
to make it to sixty.
