    Here's hoping it works well. I know they spent a lot of time working on
this, and if it was a flop it would really hurt.

    And here's hoping THIS works well, too. Not only because my sales mule
just became completely clogged with stuff, but also because if there's flaws
people could get hosed over royally. I know I'll be checking all the player
vendors tonight looking for deals. And for newer players, this will be like
loot from heaven - I can already think of some things like a 28/41 2HP with
stats that I'll likely price at 25 pp or so just to get rid of it, and I
imagine all the spider fur items and other twink stuff players have in the
bank will also be priced to move.

    Hey, they listened when I complained about vertigo in full screen!
Ideally, I'll be able to make an interface customization that looks exactly
like small screen did, with a few tweaks. Yeah, I'm old fashioned.

    Has anyone seen these yet? How do they look? Is the motion on them as
fluid as the motion on the other old animations, or is it as jerky and
unrealistic as the other new animations?

    Ah-HAH! We really were right about that! =)

    Thank Brell. You have no idea how much spam that can generate in a big
fight, and the only way to filter it was to put the person with that spell
effect on /ignore.

    Now there is a change in philosophy. That was done originally to
introduce an element of risk to the kiting ability of certain solo classes.
I guess they saw how powerful twinked melees were at soloing, and decided to
give casters back the title "kings of soloing". I'm gonna have a lot of fun
run-kiting with my necromancer (dump DoTs on target until it aggros, then
run away while pet set to not taunt beats on target).

    Good. I felt dirty using that the way we did. Now if only they could do
that for ALL effects. Example: we're doing an Emperor run. The bard playing
AoE mana song is summoned out of the room (and once out of the room, you
cannot get back in unless you have a ressable corpse there) by skeletons in
the mines far below us. Another guild wiped to them, but because they were
being hit by the mana song our bard got on the hate list. The easy fix would
be to have bard songs that are beneficial have zero aggro effect, but I'm
not sure they want us playing mana song while pulling.

> - Bind Affinity can no longer be cast on any ungrouped player in arenas.

    At the end of each day, a lot of the high-end players like to gather in
the arena in The Bazaar and beat on other guilds that we competed against
all day. A new element of competition was brought in, though, when one guild
started grief-binding the other guild in the arena and chain-killing them.

    Here's hoping this works, too. Although it doesn't matter at the high
end anyways, where most AoEs are lures or just plain unresistable.

    WOOT! They listened to us! No more wasted time re-summoning!

    Oooh, very nice! Now you can tell what has landed without having to turn

    GO GO GOOD TEAM! Now, will they fix this for ALL servers or just PvP?

    I wonder if the mobs dropping research components above their level was
the problem, or Rockhoppers dropping almost no pelts of any description was
the problem? And has the gross pathing bug there been fixed yet?

    But did they also fix the mobs that were regenerating all their HPs
every tick?

    This is going to hose us over so badly. Let me detail how you got
Celestial Rifts before:

    Kill the Emperor in Ssra. He is in a room that you must have a key to
enter, and once you start the fight nobody can enter the room except by
being ressed in (summon corpse or Call of the Hero into the room has been
disabled). He drops a no drop sceptre that has two charges of summon
celestial rifts. Each summoning gets you 20 celestial rifts, so every time
you kill the emperor you get 40 celestial rifts. These can be awarded at any
time (tradeable), which is good as even after he dies there's still mobs
alive in the room being offtanked. One Rift is required per person to create
a Vex Thal key.

    For Planar Rifts to be No Drop, the Emperor must be dropping them. That
means he'll have 40 of these things on his corpse (if he doesn't, it's a
NERF to the rate at which guilds can key themselves for VT). This also means
that, for someone to get a Celestial Rift, they MUST be present when the
Emperor is killed which means we MUST get them an Emperor key, which
requires a raid to get at least one part.

    So now the Celestial Rifts we currently have (we killed him Monday) MUST
be awarded to people within 30 days, as opposed to waiting until we had
enough to key the entire guild and then summoning them. Great, that won't
cause drama. =(

    Then they messed up, as that's EXACTLY what it just did.

    Furor wins. Too bad we lose.

    Bollocks.

    This should be cool. I had a real ugly group bug recently where I
couldn't be invited into a group by anyone, even after camping and coming
back. Here's hoping that's a thing of the past.
