Only played AC2 out of your list (in beta, and currently trying out the free
trial):

Very low. You can jump right in, the only thing that's anything but easy to
use is the chat interface (IMO).

> Interface

Easy to use, a little cluttered. Not much to say here.

> Casual Playability

I'd say definitely playable casually.

> Solo Playability

For the first part of the game, excellent. Later I'd say very difficult.

> Group Playability

 Not enough experience yet on that. Looks good though.

> Questing/Quests Quality

Lots of quests. In fact, the beginning of the game throws you right into a
loooooooong series of quests.

> In-game events/story

Dunno, haven't noticed any events. The story... well... I don't think it's
all too thrilling, it's about the same level as AC1

> Crafting Usefulness/Fun

I think it's pretty useful, but a little tedious - which is fine with me.

> Economy in the game

None worth speaking of.

> Beauty of gameworld

Vewwy pwetty!

> Quality of Dungeons

Varies, but generally I like them. They all seem to have high poly counts,
lots of details, and a little variation in them.

> Lore - Depth of backstory and history, continuing story?

Definitely has lore, a looooooong history and I believe the story goes on
with monthly events.

> Community - Good Fan sites/boards

Probably about average, there are definitely enough sources to give you
plenty of information. The warcry network for example.

> Age of game

Dunno for sure... I think 2002 or so.

>   Population of servers

Seems to hover around 600-800 people per server.

>   Population of newbies

No idea.

> Server Stability

Looks solid enough. I haven't had a crash in the last week.

> Customer Service

Never used them, so cannot comment.

See ya around
