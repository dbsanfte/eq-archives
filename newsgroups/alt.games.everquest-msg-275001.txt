    For one, I think any raiders that wanted to get in on WoW raiding are 
already gone. That sort of player wants to be first, and won't wait until 
later to see if the game has a quality raid game. Also, you should start 
reading about the WoW raiding game. Conquest (remember them?) has already 
earned three day suspensions for exploiting, in response to which they 
posted the strats for every boss kill they have in the one raid zone 
currently in game. In response to that, the nerfs have started of things 
used in the strats. Players have been complaining about poor class balance 
at 60, about lack of content, about delayed bug fixes while the nerfs are 
pushed live ASAP, about how amazingly buggy the raid-level content is, about 
how poor the itemization is, about the lack of communication from Blizzard 
to players... remind you of another game you know? ;-) Right now, the WoW 
raid game is in no way enticing to raiders - they'd be better off playing EQ 
and enjoying relatively tuned content.
