Some do. Not all, perhaps even a minority, but some.

40pp for a port strikes me as excessive. Perhaps it isn't
for a 50s+ player, but for the lower levels it's serious cash.

I know it's justified at times. But sometime I'd rather take
a little longer and save the money. If the 40pp is compensation
for mana and time used... the druid/wizard is no worse off if
I use the PoK to port and get there more quickly than if I had
walked the distance.

"Water" has become slightly cheaper, then. And much less risky.
But people will still pay extra for good milk.

It's a lousy analogy, I agree.
