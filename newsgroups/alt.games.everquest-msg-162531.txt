For my little kickback BST (I only play him when i feel bored with other
chars) I get very little help from the
lowered cost/casttime since my casting skills are so awful. I swear my
ranger is better at casting spells at low skill
then my BST. I get so many fizzles and interrupts it even feels like a total
waste of time trying to forcefully improve them by casting repeatedly for
skillups.

With the "ability summoning" i got a pet in the set time, every time unless
interrupted. Now when it is a pure spell it can take as long as several
minutes if I fizzle away some mana and have to med mana back up (And not
reached 12 yet medding takes tiiiime)
