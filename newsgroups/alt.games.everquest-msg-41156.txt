Not if they aren't our civilians.  In my mind ONE of ours is worth more than
1000 of theirs.

: There's no right answer.

Yes there is.  We hurt them bad, like Quindell says.  We make them into an
example.  We make it so that if anyone else even whispers about hurting us
again, someone will say, "Hey, remember what happened to [country X]?"  I'm
not saying we become monsters, I'm saying someimes you have to do bad things
to stop even worse things from happening.  Sinking down to their level
doesn't make us worse than them, we didn't start it, they did.  *Staying* at
their level when things are done will make us worse than them.

:They're all wrong.

No, they're not all wrong.  There're good answers and bad answers.
Somethimes the answer to a problem is almost as bad as the problem, but
that's life.  We deal with it and we don't back down from it.

I just hope all of you guys on the NG can maintain a cool head.  We're all
feeling shell-shocked and saying and thinking things that we usually don't.
Those bastards took something from all of us today -- they've just told
everyone that in the modern world no one is safe.  There's little you can do
if a crazy mother can hijack a plane and kamikazes a building.  Or drive a
truck loaded with explosives or gas or some sort of biological weapon into a
shopping mall, etc.
