Our guild alliance is trying to decide on how we are going to do raid
looting.  Someone who is a refugee from an uber-guild (he felt guilty
because he couldn't raid enough) suggested a similar thing.  My way of
thinking is that DKP's should start accumulating with the first raid, with
out a "trial" period.  That way, someone would see that they are being
"considered," while still giving more to those who do more (and naturally
have more points).  If, after a few raids, the newcomer has enough points to
buy something, then obvioulsy raiding has been good, since people are
spending points, or it's a lesser item that nobody was competing for, but
still an upgrade for that person.  Either way, it seems the most fair.
