Please don't let this start a debate about weather monks are good tanks or
not.  I'm a firm believer that if someone in my party has the ability to
taunt, they are the ones that should be taking the hits, and this reduces my
role in a group to pull and to deal damage when the mob gets back.  This is
all fine and good, except I can't do my job to the best of my ablity if no
one can get aggro away from me when I get back.

I asked a question similar to this on this board a while back and ended up
using a solution found here (thank you BTW) which was make a macro that
stops attack, FD, stand up, start attack.  This solution has worked wonders
so far, but now I'm at a point in the game where I'm fighting level 35+
creatures.  Apparently FD doesn't clear hate with this level of mob unless
you do it multiple times, and that makes me less productive than I am when
I'm taking hits.

So my question is, how do I get lower on the hate list during a fight so I
can end up with enough life to pull with without waiting on a heal, and so
I'm not keeping aggro so I can do the most damage possible?

Any input or suggestions you may have would be appreciated.
