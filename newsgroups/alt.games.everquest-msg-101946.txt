And let me add a perfect example of what equipment pressure can do to your
gameplay experience: back when the manastone still dropped, many raid
leaders REQUIRED casters taking place in plane/dragon raids to have
manastones.  I know I would have been pretty pissed off if I wanted to go on
a raid and was denied because I didn't have some item.  Although the
problems with manastones were not directly related to stats, the same thing
could happen if stats were very important and some items came out that
greatly affected one of them.
