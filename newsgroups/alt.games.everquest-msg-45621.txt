This is close to what they are doing anyways.

I see no need for a bank in Blackburrow, crushbone splitpaw guk or Cazic
however I wouldn't mind seeing a Bank/atm at the Bridge between north
and south Karana, In South Ro or Rathe Mtns, but not sure where to put
it.  My idea with the ATM is have cash only banks or at least money
exchanges, somewhere you can turn all that copper into higher coins etc,
but no item storage.  I do like the idea of more storage space.  If you
do tradeskill you wind up making mules to hold everything for you, which
certainly isn't feasable on the RP server.

To what purpose, it's already plenty heavy IMO.  If you quadruple it,
you may as well delete monks as an available class, as noone will play
one.

This i Like an excellent idea, when you have to beg for ages for a bind,
that you say you are paying for is just ridiculous.

I don't see what purpose this serves either.  There is no reason at
least in towns to not have multiple npc's selling food.

speaking the Vendor's language is a somewhat good idea, but at least
some merchants should be available for the purchase of food
irregardless, like you can get picture menu's at McDonalds for
illiterate/foreign speaking people.  Otherwise you will have peopel who
can't buy food and drink, don't let them buy or sell anything else,
but...

Not sure I understand all of your faction stuff but it sounds horribly
complex to me.

And you will have people killing merchants for Exp.  Merchant's should
not give experience or loot.

Threatening acts as KOS now.  I do like the idea that if your scowls,
you can't raise it, or maybe allow them to raise it to dubious, Actions
do speak louder than words, and if someone who starts at scowls shows
themselves to be honorable, let them raise to dubious but still have
them regarded with distrust and dubious is as high as they can go.  It
would still prevent them from banking/selling but at least would allow
them to travel through the area.

Seems hard to implement but not a bad idea, because in my opinion there
are common enemies where people who don't like one another may
cooperate.  Other races cooperating with Dark Elves against Deathfist
orcs who are encroaching on their homeland as well as that of humans and
Halflings.

Why would you need someones permission to call them a friend?  Don't see
how that fosters roleplaying, unless you feel that currently /friend is
open for abuse and harrassment of other players.
