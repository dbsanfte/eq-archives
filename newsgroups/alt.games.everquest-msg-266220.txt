Not quite. When I said his feedback on the subject was disregarded I was 
actually just refering to the GM's response. 

The post-quitting followup response was, as you said, a separate issue. 
However, even in that case, the response from CS was not indicative of a 
'we've noted your concern' nature... but rather a 'since you've quit we 
don't have to look at your concern nature'.
