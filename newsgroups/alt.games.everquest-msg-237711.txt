Alright a few days ago I joined in a guild on my server, I didn't join
in the normal fashion where you hunt with some folks, and then if they
like your style, you recieve an invite.  Nope I had recently died and
was in PoK at my bind point sending /ooc Please rez me in Zone VERY
far away for not a hell of a lot of plat.

In this particular case it was Natimbi, and I only had 50pp in the
bank since everything else was on the corpse.

Anyways the person who answered the call, was very nice and found my
body before I managed to starve to death, and gave me a 90% rez then
buffed me, and stayed beside me until the resurection effects wore
off, then wouldn't accept the cash?

She asked me why I had no guild tag I told her cuz, I really didn't
much like the concept in general of having to spend x number of hours
online, just to be at each guild function and all the other crap that
tends to happen in the "Uber Guilds".

Come to find out she was guild leader of a smallish 100 or so member
guild, whos main focus was on having fun.  Raids events and what not
are great but your not going to get kicked out if you can't
participate

She invited me into this guild and I accepted.

Well I spent the next few days, talking in guild chat, and explaining
that I have been playing eq off and on since pre-kunark, and coming
back for a few weeks every expansion or so. However I've spent WAY
more time away this time, and now that ALL of my previous issues with
the game had been addressed, that I intend to stay for good.

With that I got alot of hunting invites, and decided to form an Ldon
group.
We did, a hard one, and everyone but me for some reason died, at least
3-4 times.  The mobs never seemed to aggro on me I'm not sure why,
since I was doing WAY more damage with my pet and DD spells than most
of the group combined.

Anyways, one by one, they had to leave or whatever and finally it was
down to 3 players, so we decided to head over somewhere else and just
hunt for experience.

About this time it started snowing, here in WY, and I was seeing red
bubbles all over the place, I issued fair warnings, but the other 2
said it was ok, and we promptly went to Velks.

On the way to Velks I got seperated somewhere and died, then they
found me and rezzed me, and we finished our trek into the dungeon, if
I didn't feel obligated because of the rez, I probably would have
logged sometime before we went in.

All went well, until we evidently got aggroed by about 4 spiders at
once, and I started to cast a spell.  That was the last thing, I saw
because I went completely link dead.

The snow fall had knocked out cable service in my area, and it was
down for over 24 hours.

When I came back on, the guys I was hunting with weren't on but the
alt of the guild leader asked me what happened, and why I Chickened
out.

I explained, and she was satisfied and then asked in guild chat, if
there were any tanks who wanted to help fill out her group.  I agreed
and logged in my alt, then went on a long and perilous trek to Dulak.
(Note this is without SoW or ports, and I was coming from Misty
Thicket)

I kept her updated about my status the whole way and they were holding
up hunting waiting on me.

When I zoned into stonebrunt from the warrens I started noticing alot
of lag, and that I was going red again, I made mention of this, and
she said not to worry, it happens all the time in these zones.

I realized I was losing connection, but I kept trekking anyways, and
eventually zoned into Dulak, 1 bub away from being a corpse.

I informed her that I made it, but I was seeing serious red, but she
brought everyone over and started buffing me, then invited me to
group.

About that time, yep you guessed it, my cable went out again, and has
stayed down until just about now.

My assumption here is that I have probably pissed these guys off
pretty bad, and deffinetly not made a good first impression.  It seems
like a great guild, and I really do want to be a full and
participating member, but I don't know how to get back in thier good
graces.

I'm just a mage, a warrior, sk and a druid with levels ranging from
low 30's to mid 50's.  And most of my activities until now have
centered on leveling and cash making, with a few quests in between.

What if anything do you think I should do, other than explain myself,
to try and get these folks, to understand, that I really do want to be
a full member, and I really didn't mean for that to happen.  What can
I say, I mean I use cable exclusively to play, and when it's down it's
down.  I live in WY so when it snows, cable is always a gonner, and
it's almost always snowing here this time of year.

Any helps on what I can say or do to help the situation is greatly
appreciated.
