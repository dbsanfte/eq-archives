/agree

I was actually taunted by a couple of players who knew I had the Black Fur
Boots, showoffs who tried to get me to come camp for 24 hours with them by
ridiculing my self-only boots. I told them that I wasn't interested in
camping *anything* that long, and headed off to play some more GoD
expeditions while the tells kept coming in, sprinkled with lol's.

Well, the tells stopped coming. LOL
