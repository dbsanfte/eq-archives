Fine, stick to Diablo2 with the constantly problem-riddled Battle.net
(which is so poor BECAUSE it's free). The money payed to EQ goes to
maintain servers which run FAR smoother than Battle.net (and are DAMN
expensive to run), pay the salaries of the full-time CS staff (even if
they aren't the greatest CS in the world), pay the programmers who are
constantly working on enhancing and updating the code, and the
developement of the expansions....

Sorry, bub, you can't get all that for free. You want shoddy service,
then play a game with a free online server. You want GOOD (didn't say
great >< ), then you're going to have to fork over cash.
