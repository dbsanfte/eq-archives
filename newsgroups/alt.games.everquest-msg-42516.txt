Your last couple statements are mostly true, but it doesn't mean that
the original article, while bad journalism, etc. wasn't in relation to
the game, in terms of the PR that gamers get, direct references that
were *actually* posted in the press about EQ, etc.  While yours was just
made up spam and totally off topic.
So, as I said, tangentially on topic, unlike yours.
Next?
