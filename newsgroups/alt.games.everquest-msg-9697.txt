My time zone is great to play from: +10:00hrs GMT.

Xev normally has between 700 to 450 players on at that time. Not sure what
time that is in the US - but I am guessing, using technical terms: "the wee
small hours of the morning".

It's nice to have a zone to oneself - it gives you freedom to try all sorts
of dumb things without getting everyone else killed as well.
