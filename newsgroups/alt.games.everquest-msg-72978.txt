When Verant used to read this newsgroup a long time ago those of us who were
there before got really really tired of people posting whiny messages with
the subject line "VERANT READ THIS."  It was very annoying.

It does not happen much any more (thank god) but when it does, it is bound
to get commented on by those tired of ever seeing such subject lines.

No one from Verant has posted in this group for a couple of years.  Brad
McQuaid reads this one and posts occasionally, but he no longer works there.
So if you want them to DEFINITELY see your post, why don't you post it in
the CORRECT place?   They WILL see your post on EQ's developer board.  They
WILL see your post in /feedback.  Those are 100% chance.  Posting here is
maybe 25% chance.  Sounds silly to make a VERANT READ THIS post here now,
doesn't it?
