Actually, I think you just showed that the vision is muddy.  Sang does have
a point, in that Verant could have easily made twinking outright impossible,
but didn't.  That alone shows that some degree of twinking was consistant
with the vision.  OTOH, the level of twinking that allows a level 1 to be
running around with Mistmoore Drums and Thurgadin's Amour isn't consistant
with the vision (or so I would guess).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
