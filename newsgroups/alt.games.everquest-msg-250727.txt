There's nothing magical about CoH or any other game. Like all the other
games which you continue wanting to compare to EQ, CoH has its audience and
its own staying power (the length of which I submit it's a bit early to
predict lol). People are still playing Anarchy Online and Asheron's Call,
despite the predictions I remember vividly in this newsgroup describing both
as likely candidates to be the first commercial failures in the MMOG space.
Same is true of UO, and will be true of SWG and probably CoH.

It's no surprise that CoH doesn't scratch the itch that drives much of the
EQ audience, it definitely lacks many of the things that I miss from EQ. One
thing it's short on is immediate gratification and diversity, it's something
I've posted on to official forums and hope they are successful at
addressing. If they're not, I won't be sticking around either. Of course,
it's also true that EQ lacks many of the things that I enjoy in CoH, which
is why I'm there and not here. Newsflash!

The problem here is not with CoH, it's evidenced by your subject header:
your futile search for "it". Guess what. There isn't any "it" out there -- 
EQ doesn't have "it" and UO didn't have "it". EQ certainly has a lot more
stuff than CoH has, that's for sure, and that's a big plus in anyone's book.
But one man's "it" is another's .... etc.

There's no need to worry yourself about "threats". EQ is on its own
evolutionary trajectory as are all the others. One star is rising, the other
falling. Newsflash.

Relax.
