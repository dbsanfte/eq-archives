Hail Bill!

Most of the servers are PvE (player vs environment) and that is a good
thing.  PvP is not for everyone.  :)  (The servers with Zek I believe are
the PvP) Try a bunch of different characters, and servers if you want,
decide on which one you like.  Theres no set in stone reason you can't have
all 8 slots filled on your account because your sampling.  Each race/class
combo has good and bad things about it.  If you choose an evil type
character (Dark Elf, Troll, Ogre, Iksar) then your a bit more limited on how
to travel, but there are always ways around that.  You'll figure out that as
you go.  Enjoy, have fun, and ask for a little help when you need it.  Most
of the time people will answer questions.

Good luck, and welcome to EQ, but like others have said, we hold no
responsibility for your lost social life. :)  We'll become your family and
friends.
