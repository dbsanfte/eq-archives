  Which is just further proof of Verant's poor customer service and
lack of foresight.  What kind of doesn't create some sort of
infrastructure to allow the graceful issuance of refunds?

  What they could have done is somehow put the account on hold once
the refund is given.  In order to reactivate the account, you'd either
have to supply new account keys, or pay them back the money they
refunded for software.  It might not be an automated process, but it
would leave less of their customers with the feeling that this is a
"piss off and never come back" response from Verant for what is
essentially THEIR mistake.
