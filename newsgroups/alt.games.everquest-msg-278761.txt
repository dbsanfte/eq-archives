I agree that slow is one of those spells that totally affects game play.
I finally got my ranger up to level 70, and have some elemental gear
now, and can tank in quite a few places now, as long as the mob is
slowed.  In some of these places, once the mob is slowed, I can
self heal myself and be fine without outside healing.  Without slow
I'm visting my soul binder, unless I root the mob and back off and switch
to my bow.  And earthcaller slow just doesn't do it.  Was doing it
tonight in the Ascent, and sometimes earthcaller never fired once
during the entire battle, and the trio I was with (rng, monk, dru)
had a hard time keeping up when the mob wasn't slowed.

Thats why I'm glad I duo with a Shammy a lot.  Shammy and a ranger
make a great duo.  A more reliable slow and haste better than
my eyepatch of pluder can provide.

I would also add that the KEI line of spells are another make or
break spell.  How many times have you been grouped, and someones
KEI ran out, and they HAD to run back to PoK for a refresh?
