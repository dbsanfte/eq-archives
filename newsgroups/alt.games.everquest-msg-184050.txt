Is there a simple way for a guild leader to promote his or her alt
characters to officers?

I was hoping the new guild management tool would let me do this but,
alas, the "promote" button only seems to be activated if the selected
guild member is online.

The only way I can think to do it is to transfer guild leadership
to someone else and have them promote my alts, then transfer
leadership back.

It's a pain to have to camp out an alt just to invite a new member
if no other officers are around.

Thanks!
