You are correct. The thing that really pisses me off about the high level
game is that it is imperative that you absolutely must have a certain class
to do certain areas or its no go. The 'warrior' tanking in your examples in
the old world. The heavy leaning in Kunark toward having an 'enchanter'
and now that continues with Luclin.

Is your guild small? Planning a raid into a dungeon? No chanter on? Raid off.
Planning on taking on a named triggered spawn? No warrior or not enough
tanks on? Raid off. No cleric on? Raid off.

Our guild went into the Deep recently and we were fine until we hit a trap
that spawned a ton of mushrooms. We had about 20 people and 2 enchanters,
one was level 60. We were fine until the enchanter ran out of mana, then......
wipe out. That is just bull shit, 18 other people and we got wiped out because
2 people ran out of mana.

It just pisses me off. Its why I go play a new low level character all the time.
Hell I had a great time in Kurns tower the other day and my group was 3
shaman, we did great and had a ball. Could we do that in a higher level
dungeon? Nope, no way.

There are still places to 'grind' and adventure at least out doors with a
group that doesn't have the 'holy 3' combination but they pale in loot and
exp in comparison to a dungeon.
