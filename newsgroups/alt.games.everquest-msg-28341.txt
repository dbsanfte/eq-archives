What a total crock of bullshit. Exactly how many 'hackers' actually do this?
I put to you the vast majority (and I mean VAST) of 'hackers' are just dick
waving punks that break into systems for the simple fun of it and to say they
did it to their hacker buddies.

Any legitimate computer programmer should stay as far away from terms
like 'cracker' and 'hacker' as possible.
