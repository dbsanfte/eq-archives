Unfortunately, not. But Bin Laden is smart, resourceful, rich, and our 
sworn enemy, so we'll be better off when he's dead, no question about it. 
To be frank, I have difficulty picturing what could be worse than him. Then 
again, history does have a way of surprising even people of overactive 
imaginations.

Of course, his death will cause tens of thousands of Muslims to hate us, 
but unfortunately, that's not exactly much of a change from the current 
situation. Besides, the West will be hated as long as it's prosperous, 
free, and largely secular. If we try to help, we're "imperialistic", if we 
don't, we're "isolationist". There is not much we can do about that, but we 
can always go out on the street, buy some clothes we really like, some 
books we want to read, and then go see a movie we want to watch... and 
realize, every day, how lucky we are that we can do so.
