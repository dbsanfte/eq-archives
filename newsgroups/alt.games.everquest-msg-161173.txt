One more item for you to consider:  If you have PoP you can do the
"Faction Book" quest in PoK.  It can go in your range slot, has
1ac and 2cha, and it gives light as a greater lightstone.  There's
a spoiler for the quest in a thread on Graffe's (somebody posted a
link in another thread, for some reason I can't get to anything on
Graffe's right now), or you can just go find a Halfling named
Willamina (or something like that) looking at a tree near the SW
corner of the inner ring.  Be warned the quest will be very tedious
without the spoiler, or at least the aid of a tracker, but anybody
can do it.
