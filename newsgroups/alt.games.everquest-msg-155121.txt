Yeah, so, what's your point exactly? I said it is wrong for children
to pay for the stupidity of their parents. Let's not split hairs here.

Nice rhetoric.  However, as I have repeatedly said, the disclaimer did
not fit the comments. The OP mentioned dark humor. That does not mean
that it is impossible for anything he said to justifiably be viewed as
offensive. I'll also again offer my example, "You know, I think your
father deserved to die in the 9-11 tragedy. Aw, I was just kidding."
It would be completely inappropriate whether you were truly kidding or
not.
