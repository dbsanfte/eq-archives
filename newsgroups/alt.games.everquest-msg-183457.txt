I posted on this a couple of months ago and got a flurry of responses from
folks who were all having the same problem. It was happening to me about
once every 10 logins. It's annoying as hell and, like one of the responders
in this thread, I am not able to recover without a complete Ctrl-Alt-Del,
Task Manager/End Task and restart. A few weeks ago I noticed that it had
almost completely stopped happening and put it out of my mind. Last week, I
was mentioning this to my wife as we both logged in and, sure as hell, she
got it. So the bug has been around at least a few months, appears to be
still around, and doesn't have a reliable work around for everyone. Your
report would indicate that it still hasn't been fixed. By the way, are you
running LoY? We are, and are also running XP with nVidia cards, for what
it's worth.
