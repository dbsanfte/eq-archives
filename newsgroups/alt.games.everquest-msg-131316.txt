I'm confused by this.
1) Why use fear in a dungeon
2) My Enchanter was soloing in the warrens for pp. I was not getting
lots of agro from greens, and only had a problem when something ran off
into an area that was not green to him. At 22 most of the warrens will
be green (Excepting the names and their guards). My enchater was making
about 100pp in 3 hours (including the cash from the molars) Not fast but
safe and good faction and at level 16 some xp too.

Weight will be a slight problem, but you will fill up with molars and
weapons fast and will be selling often. The molars don't weigh much and
once you have killed a few hundred dogs you can sell in Panielle and cut
your down time.

HTH,
