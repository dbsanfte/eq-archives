Yes, if it only requires indifferent faction, but...

uhhh no. I mean you could stay indifferent to him, but he's facing a row of
skellies that will lynch you quick.

You have about 4 options as I see it:
1) Assuming your faction hasn't been trashed (you have not done negative
faction things) you MAY be able to deal with him by getting your friendly
neighborhood enchanter to illusion you Troll, Ogre, or Dark Elf. However, as
a religious person, that is lible not to work well...

2) Get a Cleric or Enchanter to use their lull line spells (the high level
AE one, name escapes my memory at the moment) to dampen the agro radius on
everything around, get in, sneak, do turn ins, get out.

3) Similar move, giving more time, get a Cleric or Enchanter to lull up
everything, and have a feign death class pull him out of the outpost, where
you can proceed to sneak and do turn ins.

4) Get an Enchanter or Necromancer to charm him, most likely dragging him
out of the Outpost, and you do turn ins while he's charmed. I don't know
what level he is but I imagine that would have to be a fairly high level
charm.
