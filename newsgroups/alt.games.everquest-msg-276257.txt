It's because it's new.  You can't add content without adding
new items -- people go nuts.   Witness the only expansion

Pre-expansion?  No idea, but probably around the same
amount.  As a guess EQ2 might even have a little more
that's really acceptable gear.   But it's all the expansions
and their items that really hit the market hard.
