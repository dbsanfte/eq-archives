You missed the part where I said that it only happens some of the time -
for example last night I was strolling around the bazaar, head up, zero
packet loss. Other times I can't take two steps without going to 90%
packet loss.

Also, although I don't think I mentioned this last time, the packet loss
issue is *not* restricted to the bazaar. (It's more common in the bazaar,
but it also happens elsewhere.)

Personally I don't think it's a deliberate plot on Sony's behalf. My own
suspicion is a bug in the packet encryption subroutines - perhaps
location is partly coded as a delta, and a single lost packet results
in all subsequent deltas being wrong until a synchronisation event occurs.
That doesn't explain why it sometimes happens when I'm standing completely
still however. :-/

In any case, it's common enough that I'd classify it as a bug. A bug that
only affects some system configurations is still a bug.

Or to put it another way, my system configuration has been essentially
unchanged for the last year. The only changes made were to install another
couple of games, and the onset of the changes was not coincidental with
those installs.

The only significant changes to the way Everquest operates on my system
have been made by the Everquest patching system.

So... it's a bug. And from what I've seen and heard, it affects a number
of people, intermittently at least. I do wonder how many "ISP problems"
causing dropouts are illusory at this point.
