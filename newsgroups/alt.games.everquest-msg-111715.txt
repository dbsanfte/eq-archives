You open up your socials and right click the button to open up your little
text box with something like 5 lines to use, the lines do not wrap.

First figure out what spells you have and which hotkey they are assigned to
in your hotkey bank.  Let's say number 1 is your superior healing spell and
you are a druid.  Number 2 is your Ensnare spell.  Number 3 is your Drifting
Death dot.

You would want to do this on your lines, (you make up your own sayings these
are generic)

/cast 1
/gsay Superior Healing on %t - %t is being healed.

and then name that one to Heal or something so you know what it is...put it
on your hotkey bank on the 2nd bank

/cast 2
/gsay Snaring %t

name that one Snare and then hit ok and put it on your hotkey bank on the
2nd bank

/cast 3
/gsay Casting Drifting Death dot on %t.

name that one Dot or somesuch - maybe Drift and again put it on your hotkey
bank on the 2nd bank...

You can go on, of course you have a limited number each time you can
use...and if you move your spells you will still cast whatever is in slot
one even if it does not correspond with what you have for the saying.

If you are on a raid with guild  you'd probably want to just do /guild
instead of /gsay since it would benefit everyone if you're the designated
snarer, etc.

You wanted to know about a key for targetting main tank as well, for that
one you would do the same with an empty social button, and do as
follows...assuming your tank is named Tankbob...(I know too creative)

/target Tankbob
/assist
/gsay Assisting Tankbob

or you can make one that is simply

/assist
/gsay Assisting %t

that would mean you would need a person targetted manually by your mouse
first and then you'd hit that button -- you'd need to name these as well.

There is a way to do this without pulling up the social buttons and blocking
your screen, but try this first and get the hang of it, then if you'd like
I'll help you with the string you type to just create a hotbutton that
appears on the end of your cursor :)

%t is the targetted mob...if you have the assist button pulled up, you can
assist your main tank and then you have the mob targetted and then use your
snare or dot without having to do any mouse work. :)
