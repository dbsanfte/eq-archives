From around 24 to 40 I got Zing requests all the time, but since then they
are very rare.  I assumed it was because people were getting lighter weapons,
but after some long boring greenie camps where topics wandered, I discovered
its because they got their stamina to 100 and have found that there is no
noticable effect on them when their stamina runs out.

Thats not to say there -isn't- some effect, its just that if there is its so
minimal
that noone cares about it.

I made my Beastlord STA 100 on creation; more HP and immunity to the
concerns of stamina loss was my thinking.  Now I find that the beastlord
weapons are all apparantly extremely light!  Oh well, I'll be happy about
it when I get to Kedge camping.

PS Word of Vigor isn't, as I'd hoped, a group zing, or rather it is but its
tied in with one of the least HP/mana efficient group heals in the game,
costs a metric tonne to cast, and as I note, noone in their 50s needs zing
anyway.
