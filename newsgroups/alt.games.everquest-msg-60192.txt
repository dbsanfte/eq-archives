I haven't been able to find him since I started looking for him just after
the Halloween events.

A lot of people of told me where he should be, where use used to be, but no
one has said "yup, seen him recently".

Even put of 20p bounty on him the other day, had a number of low levels
running around looking for him, and a high level ranger wandered in and
helped out as well.

Still can't find him.  Starting to think he got snatched by all the undead
at Halloween.

Oh well, time for a different weapon..
