>Wasn't it 64k?

No. But most people only had 64k to 128k ram at that time, so the idea
that no computer would need more is not too odd. Also this was a time
that most of the big computing tasks were done via network on a
server. So 640k of ram should be fine to run a client.

This was of course long before of a graphical interface became a
popular (or even widely known) idea.

The reason that the quote has much weight is that DOS has no way of
addressing more than 640k except via tricks. Flaws in the design that
allowed more ram to be addressed. 640k is increased to 1024k with the
High Memory Area. Then part of that HMA can be used to page out ram
via Extended Memory, (Part of the memory is swapped for different
memory at need) which is very slow, but was the only option at the
time. Then Expanded Memory came out, which loosened the memory
constraints to what we see today with Win3.1 and Win98.
