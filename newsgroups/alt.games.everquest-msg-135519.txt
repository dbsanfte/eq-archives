Here's another tip. When you are going crazy with buying, selling,
loading up bags, etc. remember this very important fact: Weight doesn't
matter in the bazaar. You can be 800 pounds overwieght and move just
fine. The same can NOT be said for Shadowhaven.

I was sitting in a bank in Shadowhaven last night trying to get the new
interface tuned up to my liking and making some PoTC fishing poles when
I got a VERY embarassed /tell from a level 2 mage who was the mule alt
of a 56 paladin. She had moved up into the alcove up the steps from the
bazaar heading towards shadowhaven to transfer a bunch of items around
in her trader's satchels for merchant mode. (Said she moved because the
lag at the bank was slaying her.)

Long story short, she had been there a while, had no SoW, no buffs of
any kind, and accidentaly stood up and zoned through into Shadowhaven. 
There she was, literally INCHES from the zone line, but she was
something like five hundred pounds over weight and could not move. She
didn't have Gate yet and badly needed a TL to bind and didn't want to
ask for it in public channels.

I got such a laugh from this story that I dropped what I was doing and
ran down there and TL'd her.... about ten feet. (She was bound by the
bank there in the bazaar.)
