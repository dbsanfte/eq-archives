I pray that restructuring never happens.  It's just one more thing for
people to look to the government to provide them.  It's just one more way
for the government to work it's way into our lives.  We're all responsible
for meeting our own basic needs, once the government starts doing that, then
we will start becoming less capable of doing so ourselves.  Just look at the
inner-city welfare socities; welfare has been more effective in keeping the
poor down, than raising them up.  Making "society" (government) responsible
for meeting the needs of the people will only result in a broader
degeneration of the people, in a similar manner.

Or, is there an answer outside the government that doesn't create those
pitfalls?  If there is, I'd be interested to hear it.
