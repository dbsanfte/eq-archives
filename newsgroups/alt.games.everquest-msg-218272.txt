    A paladin is walking the streets in Qeynos when he hears a "psst" from a
merchant's stall. He looks over and sees a vendor trying to catch his
attention, so he walks over to the fellow.

    "I have here something that will make you more attractive than ever
before, sir paladin!"

    The paladin doesn't need to think twice about that offer! "I'll take
it!" The merchant hands him a small statuette, a mouse made of brass. "Trust
me," the vendor says.

    So the paladin goes back to his morning walk. After a short time he
hears a "squeek" behind him. So he turns, and he sees a rat following him.
"Must be coincidence," the paladin thinks. So he walks some more, and he
hears more squeeking behind him. He turns around, and now he has about a
handful of rats following him. The paladin begins to quicken his pace,
trying to outdistance the vermin, but when he looks back he has a score or
more of rats chasing after him! The paladin breaks into a full-out run, as
rats by the dozens add to the horde now trying to run the paladin down. The
paladin dashes out onto the Qeynos docks, grabs the brass mouse from his
pocket, and hurls it out into the water, then stands aside as a torrent of
rats run past him and jump into the sea and drown.

    Winded, the paladin slumps down onto the planks of the dock. As if by
magic, the merchant appears from behind a nearby crate and fixes the paladin
with a wicked glare. "So, sir paladin, what do you think of my gift to you?"

    The paladin looks at the merchant, then looks out at the water where the
last few bubbles from the drowning rats are rising to the surface. Looking
back to the merchant, the paladin says, in an even voice:

    "Do you have any brass rangers?"
