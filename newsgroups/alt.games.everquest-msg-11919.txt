90 in 20 seconds is 1 every 4.5 seconds.  I held the grade of Sharpshooter and
I don't believe I could do it with a bolt action rifle unless they were real
cooperative (standing real close together).  A lever action couldn't due to low
ammo capacity and slow reload time.

Oh, I didn't mean to say there was no advantage to a semi or full auto. 
Personally, I don't care for modern firearms because the the idiots you meet
who are gun/militia nuts.  I prefer to shoot under "old west" rules because the
re-enactor/shooters are nicer and more reasonable people.  Other than the 9mm
in the headboard of the bed I didn't own anything more advanced than some bolt
action mausers and lever action carbines until the L.A. riots.  After than I
bought a ChiComm semi-auto carbine because I wanted something a little faster
to deal with gangs of arsonists (the police stopped a car full of firebombs
within a block of my apartment).

I am resigned to the fact that by the time they roll me into the grave most of
my firearms collection will have been turned due to further gun restrictions. 
It's primarily a problem associated with population.  With a higher population
the percentage of homicidal idiots remains the same but the actual number rises
to an unacceptable level.

I'm not really worried about the government using military force against the
citizenry (which is the great fantasy-fear of the militia movement), and if
they do the bulk of them deployed into the urban areas will be half-trained
National Guard.  My associates and I could acquire what we need from the
National Guard troopers without too much difficulty.  But, as I said, I doubt
this will ever happen.
