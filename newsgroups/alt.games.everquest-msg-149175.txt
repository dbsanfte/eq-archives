Chanters and clerics are often quite busy, and have little space in
their spell rack for a full set of stuns.  Paladins, on the other hand,
usually have no assigned function other than melee, possibly MT
or offtank, and keep an eye out for the occaisional LOH need. They
have an excellent line of stuns, and are in optimal position to use
them (right up close where they can see the mob starting to cast),
and as a bonus, hybrids don't interrupt their melee output as much
as clerics do, so it takes less DPS away for them to stun.
