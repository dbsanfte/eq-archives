For rogues its linked to the backstab timer.
After using BS I had to count 3 or 4 seconds and hit ID
As long as the BS timer ungreyed by the time the kick attempt was made it
was good to go.
If the timer on BS was grey it always failed.
I think monkly-business had the times to wait for various specials iirc.
Btw rogues don't get kick.

Hmmmm time to get Ezoob moving again kinda been mothballed since my Daoc
venture.
