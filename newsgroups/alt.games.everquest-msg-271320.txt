Get some hp gear,an Embalmers skinning knife(summons bandages),
a Sarnak Backstabber(1 hand piercer, 20/10,no rec level) and a
Tolapumj's Robe(36% haste,Int casters only,cheap).
Set camp in MS in front of Seru,haste yourself and pet(I wouldnt
bother with other buffs except shielding and of course Breeze),pull
hoppers with slow,tank for pet,dot or debuff mob as mana permits.
When your health falls below 70 bind wounds,while medding up at the
same time,all in all very little downtime.You can lessen downtime by
letting your pet tank a little,a little more when you can foresee you
need to bindwound after last mob.I didnt bother with Temp,though
it will help.
Buy a "Dusty girdle of reformed Sand"(Improved damage 4) from all
the hopper hides you get in MS.
I still use this tactic at 45 in Dulak,mobs at zone in fall so fast,I
only need to bw every second one,in fact downtime now is less than in
the twenties in MS due to the powerful(yes!) nukes you have at this
level.

Dont listen to outdated guides,which tell you you're meleeing days are
over at 20 or 30,with the cheap (hp)gear nowadays available in Bazaar
and bw working up to 70% health,situation has radically changed.
Dont listen to people on the main enchanter site :),who tell you
charming is the way to go,constant charm breaks cause tons of wasted
time for getting control again over TWO mobs pounding on you - or 
team up with a Druid or Ranger for snare,Druid would be better as they
get ENsnare at lower level.

Playing Ranger(s) :)  through most of my EQ carreer,I can tell you
most Rangers would be very happy to find an Enchanter partner,opens 
up great possibilities for fearkiting.

I  always enjoyed tanking and meleeing with my casters,maybe I am a 
little strange.  :)
