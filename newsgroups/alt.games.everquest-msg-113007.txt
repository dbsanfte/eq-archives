Sort of on the topic... How would a soloing 51 Druid fare in Maiden's 
Eye? I tend not to go to the moon a lot (I find that most mobs there have 
stupid MR), so if you could save me the trip to go and find out for 
myself, I'd appreciate it. =)

I've been there before, but as a high-thirties tourist, without 
considering doing any hunting.
