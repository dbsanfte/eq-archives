Yes, yes, I know I can bind forage to a movement key or something like that,
but that's not what I want.  =)

Anyone know of a way by which I can have my druid forage (/doability 3), bag
whatever he gets (/autoinventory), and repeat ad nauseum?

Ideally what I'd like to do is fire up my druid in a separate window, and
start him on the task of foraging whilst I raid or group on Monual.
Currently I have to switch windows to forage, and it may be some long
minutes before I can find the time to do - either I get too busy or I just
plain forget.

I've experimented with hotkeys, but they fail because you can't call one
hotkey from another hotkey.  That's probably on purpose because otherwise
you could automate a whole bunch of stuff and SOE wants players behind
keyboards controlling characters.  I can understand and appreciate the
philosophy, even if it makes things terribly inconvenient for me in this
instance.  =)

Still, maybe there's something I'm overlooking.  Anyone know of a way to
automate foraging and autoinventorying that would allow that to happen
automatically without my having to keep that window in the foreground?

Thanks.
