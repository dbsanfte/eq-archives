Yes the familiar for the wizard is a little weird. The pet buffs are 
completely unnecessary because you can tell the pet to go away. The pet 
is affected by AE spells and can die. Something bad does happen to you. 
You lose some mana, mana regen, some resists, see invis and, reduced 
fizzle rate. That's a lot to lose.

You can cast the augment on the Flaming Swords. Also, you can get the 
swords to attack more than one mob. If the swords are attacking one mob, 
and you get hit by another, when the swords are finished with the one 
mob, they will attack the one that attacked you.
