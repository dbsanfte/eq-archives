The voices in EQ2 tend to get on my nerves; the voices in WoW are more to 
accent an encounter than to be the encounter, which suits me just fine. :) 
The lore is pretty deep, and when you play a race for the first time, you 
get this nice introductory video which is taken straight from the current PC 
action going on at that moment in your area.

I bought mine on Thursday evening from Electronic Boutique (went to the 
physical store after seeing on www.ebgames.com that it should be available 
in the stores); they had gotten in a shipment that day, so you should have a 
good chance of getting a copy. I started on the Hellscream server, which is 
(fairly) low population; I then yesterday tried out the Ner'zul (sp?) 
server, which a friend is on, and had no trouble getting onto it as a new 
player either. So far, I have a level 9 night elf druid, a level 8 undead 
warlock, and a level 7 human priest on Hellscream, and a level 9 dwarf 
hunter on Ner'zul (sp?). Playability is great, love the interface, grouping 
(which I finally did yesterday) is fairly easy, tradeskilling is very 
easy...overall, this just might pull me away from EQ altogether. Have to 
reassess to decide, although it's pretty much killed my secondary EQ 
account; will be unsubscribing that one fairly soon. My poor troll. :)
