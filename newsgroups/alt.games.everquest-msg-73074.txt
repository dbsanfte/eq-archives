  Do you mean "lag" as in high packet loss, long ping times, or "lag"
as in poor frame rates?

  In any event, I doubt more memory will do too much to help you,
unless you have Luclin installed.  I'm not sure what you can do about
Internet lag, save doing a traceroute on the EverQuest servers to try
to deduce where the information is getting congested.

  If you have poor frame rates (the game plays like a slideshow,
cursor jumps around) then make sure you have the recommended drivers
for your video card from everquestlive.com (not all of the drivers
recommended for EQ are the latest officially released versions... some
are earlier versions or beta versions).  Other than that, you might
want to read my "Horrible frame rates?  Here's an imperfect fix."
message.  Unfortunately I think some of us are going to suffering bad
frame rates no matter what we do, until Verant figures out what they
screwed up and fixes it.
