Well its a slightly different circumstances for me... my girlf and best
friend are both clerics, so I've bought them dots many many times.   It
doesn't really come up anymore... they both joined my (raiding) guild, and
get many stacks of (free) dots along with the other clerics

Last I checked I do....

No, I've never made *anybody* explain why they aren't doing what I want them
to.
Im not a bard, BARD KNOWS BEST. BARD DECIDES what he plays.

You want to be in control of the bards songs?   Either pay for his account,
or go make your own.

(Note giving people helpful advice in a manner which they appreciate it is
just a LIL different to telling them how to play their characters)

If you told me how to play my class, or barked orders about what I had to
do, Id quickly tell you where to go fuck yourself

If I group with somebody who truly is awful, I will make a note of their
name and avoid them in future.  I won't make them feel inferior or pissed by
telling them their class though

2 people have ever been kicked out my groups... and I've been playing a long
long time (1 kicked out, 1 went LD and was quickly replaced).

Done all the time?  /shrug.. not in my game

Then believe its made up.  Im not proving myself to you

I've played/leveled 2 clerics upto 65.  My own cleric upto 60.  Done the
cleric epic twice. Been 2 clerics on a cheal rotation (at the same time)

But your right, I've never played a cleric.
