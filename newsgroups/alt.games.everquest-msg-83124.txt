Hi:

I played my Wizard through to level 52, I then decided to totally start
again. En-route to 52 I did the coin quest that's handed out by the Gnome
Ryklas in Lake Rathetear. I started this quest for the first time at around
level 26 and got great experience, so good in fact that I did the quest over
and over, which took me either level 29 or 30. After deleting my character I
re-started, using the *same* name for my Wizard. I'd been looking forward to
hitting level 24 so that I can do this quest and gain a few quick levels. I
got to level 24 this afternoon, bought my Levitate spell, then headed to
Lake Rathetear full of excitement as I knew I'd soon be leveling up pretty
quickly. I found Ryklas, bound next to him, got the coin, gated to the
Commons and gave the coin to the NPC. I was greeted with a message telling
me I had gained experience, but when I looked my experience bar hadn't
moved. Okay, off I head to get another coin, I gave a second coin, got the
message telling me I had gained experience, and yet again, no movement on my
blue bar. I did the quest eight times and still gained nothing. I'm
presuming the quest is broken, so have reported it as a bug.

My question is though, do you think that the NPC 'remembers' the level (from
my deleted character) as I'm using the same name, this might cause me to get
such a miniscule amount of experience the quest would have to be done many
hundreds of times to gain any significant experience gain?

Many thanks to all that answer, safe hunting ...

Stevie.
