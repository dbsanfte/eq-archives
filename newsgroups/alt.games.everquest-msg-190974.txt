Right now, I would probably focus on bringing up a class that help the Pally
level up than focusing on rezzes (especially since Pally's get rezzes at
higher levels) and that sweet Shammy SoW will help your Pally avoid needing
those rezzes in the first place.  Shammy can focus on pulling, slowing,
healing while Pally fights the good fight.
