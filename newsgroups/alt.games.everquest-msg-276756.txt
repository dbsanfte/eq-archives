Nobody made it back to a bank with those copper anyways... =)

Anyway, while I wasn't the one that said that, its still effectively 
true even if its not literally true. You don't get plat per se, but you 
do see gems and other high level tradeskill items, and can score bazaar 
drops that command 10s of thousands of plat. 

Further, as -your- level increases your ability to farm 35-45 level mobs 
increases... and thus we have 70th level druids camping giants in Rathe 
Mountains.
