Since they got rid of the coin drop I've just been buying stuff I know I can
get my money back on, doing the transfer the old fashion way, then selling
it to recoup the cash.   Kinda time consuming and sometimes you take a bit
of a hit.  I've seen people shout that they needed someone trustworthy to
transfer some items and cash.  I've personally never had any problems doing
it this way either but I think with big items a fellow guildie is the only
way to go(or 2 accounts on 2 computers of course).
