Yes, KC truly sucks.  I occassionally play with a friend form works 53
warrior in OOT with my 54 shaman but only as kinda of a favor.  I'd rather
solo in that zone (cyclop's).   His warrior is about 3 years old now and
"tweeked" and then some but he quit playing him out of frustration quite a
while ago.  I doubt you could solo cyclops but at night there are often a
dozen players in the zone so you might find a partner....  exp isn't
fantastic but its certainly better than KC and the loot is ok.
