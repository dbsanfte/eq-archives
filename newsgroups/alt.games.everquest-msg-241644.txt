I'd say it depends on the surname. A variation of "arthur" in itself
should be okay, given that it's a common real name, not one made up
for a story. If the surname were a variant of "Pendragon", then there
would be a problem. Kinda like Silllvestur would be okay, but adding
the surname Stallowne would make it a bad name.
