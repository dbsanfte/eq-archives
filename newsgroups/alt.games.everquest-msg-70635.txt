  Hm.  Isn't it illegal to resell an OEM copy of Windows?  If you own
a Dell and you have your OEM cd, even if you uninstall Windows 98 (and
replace it with Linux or some other version of Windows, like XP) it's
still illegal to sell it.  Though I think the principle behind that
notion is ridiculous (if you buy the software, you should have the
right to sell it if you're no longer using it).  I heard something
about Microsoft cracking down on people doing this on eBay, since the
launch of XP.

  If we're talking an "untainted" OEM copy of Windows from Microsoft
(the type of copy used by white box manufacturers) would one likely
have the difficulties you mentioned?  Because it seems to me like this
is about the only kind of OEM copy of Windows 98 that it's likely
you'd be able to legally purchase.  Though I realize piracy is a
relatively easy thing to do for the end user, it's more difficult for
a person to advertise and sell illegal software without getting
caught.
