I have played a bard to 14 so far, so no real experience pulling as
one, but I pay attention...

Well if you have done your part as a monk and necro puller you probably
have the basics.  Outdoors you will want to have Selo's running, invis
isn't a bad idea of course, lull, fading memories, mez, and perhaps a
snare.  The thing is that if you can use Fade over and over, pulling is
going to be a breeze.  Fade costs 900 mana as I recall, though, and
Bards are notorious for bad mana regen.  You get a med skill of 1 and
your only other mana regen will come from gear.  If you have good regen
gear however, at least these days, I would imagine that you could use
fade quite a bit.

(I know that I see lots of bards using it over and over...)

To pull with fade you are essentially using the same strategy as feign
pulling but doing it much faster since there is no tagging and no
waiting on mobs to reset.  You simply need to get one mob out of a
crowd, out of social agro range, and then fade.  Now re-agro and you
have him single.  If you can lull everything around it, fine.  Easy
pull.  If not, you can also use your other tools to seperate them.
Start by agroing with a mez, for example.  Or you could use a snare to
slow one down.

Another tool to keep in mind is a judicious use of indirect agro.  If
you get in frenzy range or if you tag a mob in any way, you have direct
agro.  Any social mob near a mob with direct agro will also agro.
However mobs that you agro with indirect agro will not bring adds.  If
you can tag one mob and run him past a doorway, for example, you may be
able to only agro one mob in there.  Even though he has buddies all
around him, only he saw the one you kited by him in the hall and only
he will chase you.  This is important to remember if you are going to,
say, use a mez to pull.

You can mez a mob, agroing another.  The one with direct agro is mezzed
and isn't chasing while the one with indirect agro may be chasing you
but he isn't breeding any adds because you haven't actually touched him
yet.  (You only have indirect agro)  You can then invis yourself and
run your pull through multiple social (but blind-to-invis) mobs without
agroing.  Get your pull back to camp and fade.  Although your mez wore
off and all those mobs you ran past are now chasing you, they agroed
off of the one you mezzed, not the one you pulled.

Some other things to think about: you have some good tools to help with
chain pulling.  You are much faster than most mobs so if your pull is
too fast, and the mob in camp isn't quite dead yet, you can kite the
new one around a bit, mez him, or snare him to keep him busy until the
tank is ready.  If anything, your number one priority should be to
never take too long on the pull because you can always delay the next
one but if you are late getting back to camp, your group loses the
experience on the last kill.

Also make sure to use the toggle-targets key and/or HOTT to watch the
old mob's health.  (Default for toggle is tab?)  When you are out in
the field getting your next victim, always keep track of how much
health the last one has.  One way to do this is to make sure that every
time you target a mob, you toggle back to the one in camp before you
target another.  You are too far away to actually click on the mob in
your camp but you can keep targeting him as long as you keep switching
back to him every time.  Another, easier way to keep track of mob
health is, if available, to use HOTT.  Any time you want to see how
much health a last mob has, just target your tank.  His target shows
up...  This makes it much easier to get a feal for one to bring the
next mob to camp.
