It costs about $250 (max) to go from P3-500 to Athlon 1800.  You need to
keep an eye on what kind of RAM is required for a new motherboard unless you
don't mind buying more, but besides that, to upgrade all you'd need to buy
is a motherboard & CPU.

But if you do decide you want to maybe upgrade that, post about it here
first, asking for recommendations.  All motherboards are NOT created equal.
