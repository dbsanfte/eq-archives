Yes, this is one I've noticed also.  What happens is that Selo's can only go
so fast, it has a fixed max speed.  Drums of the beast add a percentage
boost to drum songs, such as Selo's.  This percentage takes the Selo's speed
over max speed.  But rather than stopping at max speed, the value rolls
over, like the recent faction roll over bug.  This results in the bard
moving at less than walk speed.  The faction rollover was fixed in a timely
manner.  I wonder if this will be fixed as well.
