Jim,

I think you're correct.  There is a spike in trading around mid week.  I 
also noticed the same things on items.  For instance, one day I had some 
extra bone chips so I put them up for sale.  They were snatched up 
immediately (had the price too low).  So I camped a few skelly areas and 
farmed more chips.  Selling stacks at highway robbery prices.  Within a 
couple weeks, market dried up.  I went on to find other components and 
trade skill items that moved.

A friend of mine asked if I play the price war game - keep lowering prices 
to out do a competetor.  I said "no - I sit tight and use patience".  It 
does work, just slowly.
