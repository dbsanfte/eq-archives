Oh, sounds like a really worthwhile deal! I frequently play at about 3-4am
CST, so there aren't that many people online then either. Will have to check
into this system... I know damn well I'll need a LOT of PP for my spells
when I do reach 19.

Thanks!
Darklet, druid of *almost* 18 seasons

Thanks for playing.
