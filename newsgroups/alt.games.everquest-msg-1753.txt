I've crossed this numerous times, and athough it still scares me a bit each
time, I have yet to be killed.  I usually follow the stream right through
the entire way.  This is as a Cleric too, mind you, so I'm both visible and
non-SoW'd.  Just take your time, keep looking all around you (those spiders
are fast), and be careful.  It sounds like useless advice, but thats really
all it takes.  I agree with one of the previous posters that they must have
a small aggro range -- there were a few times I was sure they would attack,
but they just kept on going right past me.

Of course, I usually see a few bodies each time I go through there, so its
entirely possible that I've just been lucky so far. ;)
