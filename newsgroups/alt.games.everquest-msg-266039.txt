Please don't blame my inept humor on Lenny, poor guy has
enough to worry about.  I knew it was a bad idea to try
and help Tyras get the joke, if you have to explain
something its never going to be funny.

I could have just said "yo, cheep is a noise birds make,
the word that means inexpensive is spelled cheap"

Or better still, just chuckled that the original joke
was being missed, which was in its way funnier than the
joke itself, and not posted any attempt to "help out"
at all.

But NOOOOOO, I had to go and make things worse trying to
walk the poor thing further down the garden path in the
hopes that eventually the light would dawn, if we just
went far enough.
