Digging back in the thread here to find the link to the boards. I'd
heard about the story before on the /gu boards, but decided to go
check out the site above. You know, if the antics in this incident
hadn't convinced me that these were a group of morons, the website
does a nice job of it. Trash-mouthed d00ds writing the website news
with a whole bunch of badass-wannabe posturing just screams "Guild
full of morons!"...
