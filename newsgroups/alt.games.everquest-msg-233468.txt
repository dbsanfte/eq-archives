Bards can do three kinds of kiting:

1.  DoT kiting.  Bards have many DoT songs that can stack on
a single target, so the bard runs around at Selos speed and
layers DoTs on the mob until it dies.

2.  AoE kiting.  Bards have songs that hit an unlimited
number of "area" targets, but the drawback is that the
area is small and centered around the *Bard*, not his target.
So the Bard has to run around just a few steps ahead of the
mass of mobs on his tail.  If he gets too far ahead, the
damage song(s) don't land, and if he goes too slow, the
mobs catch up and all 99 of them hit him at once, *splat*.
This used to be more effective back when Bard AA skills
allowed them to increase the range of their AoE songs,
and extend their duration, but Sony nerfed that a few
patches ago because Bards were AoE kiting zillions of
high-end PoP mobs for insane experience.  Now it's courting
suicide to try (not that it wasn't always very dangerous).

3.  Swarm kiting.  Bards have a Charm song, so in this
method of kiting they gather up a large number of mobs
in a train, bunch them together, then charm one mob in the
bunch and have it attack the others.  The other N-1 mobs
will attack the pet and very quickly knock its health down
to almost nothing.  At this point the Bard then breaks
charm (timing is everything), and switches to the DoT
songs (see #1) to quickly finish off the crippled ex-pet.
Rinse, repeat, gathering up more "helper" mobs as needed.
This is fast and effective when done right, but can still
be instant death if you make one false move, plus it can be
tedious since you have to remain on the move at full speed
at all times, circling without running into an obstacle,
and killing one mob does not make for a safe resting period,
since there are still many other mobs on your tail.
Also Bards are limited as to what level of mobs they can
Charm, so it's not like they can do this with uber-mobs
for uber-exp.

It's also technically possible for Bards to fear-kite,
using their Fear song to make a mob run away and then
run after it slashing at its back, but this is far
less time-effective than the other methods and I've
never seen any bard actually bother doing it.

Now that you know about Bard kiting, the old saying
may make more sense:  "Never trust a running Bard".

And then there's what I call "lazy kiting", since it
involves no running at all.  I 2-box my Bard with my
65 Paladin, and the Paladin just keeps the mob
rooted with Shackles of Tunare (a fast-casting, long-lasting
root) while the Bard stands still and twists his DoT
songs on the mob.
