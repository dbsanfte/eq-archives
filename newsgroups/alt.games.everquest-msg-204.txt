To date I've never seen an answer for this
one.

After exploring CC with my 19 bardling, I
suggest that the dwarves down there are
the most  likely recipient; the captain
in particular seems a probable.  Couldn't
get him to say so, even when carrilioned
up to amiable, but that might just be
failure to find the right keywords.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the forsight
to pass a backpack full of the pesky things
over before sending in the scout, so I
wasn't able to simply try handing everyone
down there a scalp.  Then again, its likely
four scalps or a container filled and combined,
and I've noticed that they don't seem to have
the handy "wasn't there something else" lines
that let you know you are on the right track
for mobs in velious.

I've burned a couple hundred of the things, and
very much doubt that they are good for anything
fantastic.  Best bet, faction with the CC dwarves,
who don't seem to be on coldain faction?
