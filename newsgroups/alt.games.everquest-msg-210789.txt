    Which, the one that increases AC that they keep on themselves, or the
one that they keep up on their animation to increase its damage output? My
enchanter soloed her way to 29, and all through the 20's she was meleeing
with her pet. You better believe she used haste!

    Not all foci are summonable by a mage. Specifically, all the original
mage foci were items the mage would find very valuable (improved damage
bracer, reagent conservation neckpiece, mana preservation earring, spell
haste ring, buff extension shoulders). This is the first item that the mage
has almost no use for. The first one is completely useless to the magician,
as a matter of fact. They get it at level 20, and they get their first DoT
spell at level 44. Giving a class something they have no use for themselves
seems a little odd, no?

    Now, let's look at what could have been done instead. Take each class
that could really benefit from a BA focus: Druid, Shaman, Necromancer,
Shadow Knight, Bard. We'll skip Enchanters, Clerics, Magicians, and
Beastlords, although you could certainly do the same for them if you wanted.
Look at each class, and decide what a good slot would be for the focus based
on gaps in itemization/twink gear. Now make quests in Plane of Knowledge for
class-specific No Drop items that are BA I, II, III, and IV items. Don't
make the quests progressive, so players don't have to slum to get the level
IV item, but do give some advantage to people that have done prior quests
(eg. "Go forth and bring me three uncommon items and one rare item, to be
combined in this bag, or bring me three uncommon items and your old BA item,
to be combined in this bag.") You've now added content to the world, and
depending on what items you pick to be "collected" you may not have even had
to add anything beyond the NPC quest dialogue and the reward items to do it.
Look at the existing collector quests in PoK to see how easy it is. All it
requires is for a developer to sit down and think about what he wants to do.
