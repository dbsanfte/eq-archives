Funny thing is, in the early 1500's, ask was spelled axe.  I'm reading a
reprint of an old book in modern type, but with it's original 1520's
spelling, and it is amazing to read things like a person's name spelled
three different ways on the same page.....

There was not uniform spelling in the English language until relatively
recently (in the past 200 years?)  Maybe we're coming full circle and
returning to that state of affairs again.
