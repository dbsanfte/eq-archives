	The entire Ranger/Druid epic could only be solved by handing the interim
items to random NPCs.  Legions of PCs of both classes sacrificed hours and
hours of questing in this manner until the right NPCs had been found.

	Half the epics in the game had been solved before the Ranger/Druid quest
was even properly discovered.  People were still arguing over whether there
was one quest or two when the third or fourth epic had been won.
