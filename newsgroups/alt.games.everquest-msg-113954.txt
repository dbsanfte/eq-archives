You choose to be that precise about this, we don't.  If I held the same
standards at home that I do at work, I would probably be in an asylum.

Ok, let's see... two cups of water... when was this measuring cup last
calibrated?  Half a cup of milk... hmm, it's within periodicity, but I don't
have a reciept inspection form to ensure that the expiration date is
accurate.  Brown meat... where's my color comparetor, to ensure it's cooked
properly, oops, that bit exceeds maximum chunk thickness.  Maybe I should
use a surface pyrometer to make sure the burner is the right temperature,
what's the tolerence on that again?

No, I really don't want to live my life like I'm doing maintainence.

Because, misspelleng a werd in a usenet post won't cause me to use the wrong
material for a body to bonnet stud on a main steam root valve, causing it to
sheer during heatup, releasing steam into the space, and killing pretty much
an entire watchteam.  Not doing my job properly just may... do a search for
the U.S.S. Iwo Jima, and you'll see what I mean.  I can't live my life like
that, though.  You live on that peak as long as you have to, then you come
back down.

That's fine.  As far as I'm concerned, I'll send of a message that's
coherent, and move on.
