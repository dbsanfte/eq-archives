Much like trying to interpret the bible, this can be interpreted in
different ways in order to reinforce the viewpoint of the person who is
doing the interpretting.  It is not possible to say now exactly what the
intent of the original framers of the constitution was, as they are not
around to ask.  You interpret it the way you do, which may very well be
correct, and Dan interprets the same words differently, which also may very
well be correct.  At this point in time, I don't think it is so important to
determine what the original intent was, but rather to determine what is best
for us in the world of today, which is different in many ways from the world
at the time of the framing of the constitution.

You present good arguments as to why you interpret it the way you do, but
that does not mean it was the intent of the framers.
