Amen, brother.  I can't even use it - it says I have an invalid Login.  
Someone here on the boards suggested I change my password because that fixed 
that problem for someone else, so I went into EQ and tried to modify my 
account settings - couldn't.  It would not take my password.  I could play the 
game, but not modify my password, billing, etc.

I called them and the guy reset my password.  I went in and changed it to a 
password I know, and now I can play the game AND modify my account.  But, EQIM 
still refuses to recognize my account.

I used their online help chat app today and talked to a CSR, who said what I 
am experiencing is a known bug, among many, apparently.  He couldn't point me 
to a page that has all the known bugs listed, though.  I guess they are so 
numerous that making that list public right now would be an embarassment.
