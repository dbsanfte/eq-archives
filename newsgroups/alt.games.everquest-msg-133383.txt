}what's with all these wierd ("cross")posts? is there a way to just ignore
}them, like a feature i don't know about?

Well, you can junk threads in most newsreaders, dunno what they call it... 
filter by topic, maybe?  Many will also let you filter posts to more than 
n groups.

}i don't seem to recall this many coming in a few days, as compared to maybe
}a month ago

Yeap, it's a recent plague.  Might be partly my fault for finding one of 
the arguments interesting.  Although I notice they're featuring different 
lists of groups this week.  It'll tone down in a bit, it always does.

}aright, and these wierd acronyms . . AFAIK = as far as i __________ ?? why
}can't it be 'kanrecall' - its not AFAICR though . . . school me!
}what's the K ?

Know.

}most of the rest i can figure out, but isn't there some kind of manual for
}this type of thing?
