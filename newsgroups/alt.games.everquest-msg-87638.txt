One of my first characters is a mage...languishing around level 32 but I'd
love to get him higher.  I don't know if that has biased me towards 'em but
I do know that I've done drive-by clarities on mages more than any other
class.

When doing the outdoor xp grind thing with a partner and a pet I'll always
ooc a trade for a couple summoned weapons...unfortunately there's so few
mages post 50 on Zeb...dying for one to join my guild.  But no, I won't
deliver a clarity to a mage either. <g>
