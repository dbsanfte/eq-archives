You might have less HP than her, but you are also higher level, so you might
actually be a better tank than her against mobs of her level.  I wonder if
the following would work:

    1. Summon the lowest level pet you've got that roots.  (Mages have a pet
    that casts root, don't they?)

    2. Let that pet fight alone until it gets the mob rooted.  Shaman can
    DOT if she wants.

    3. When the mob is rooted, you step in and get very close.  You want to
    be closer than the pet or Shaman, so that the mob will uselessly flail
    at you.

    4. Shaman and your pet kill the mob.

If the pet ends up doing too much damage and KSing the Mage, have the Shaman
start meleeing during #2, trying to stay behind the pet on aggro until the
mob gets rooted and you step in to take aggro.

I assume, of course, whatever you do will be in a high XP zone.  Besides PC,
don't overlook Kurn's Tower.  The ZEM is only slightly less than PC (150
instead of 160).  The mobs there are plentiful and often uncamped on many
servers.
