You probably don't have the faction to do it, but you don't have to kill
Mammoth. If you take the flask of nitrates to the gnome in the city zoo he
will give you regurgatonic which can be fed to the bear. I haven't seen
Mammoth spawn in the last couple of weeks so I don't know how big the
factions rewards are for that one. Got to be better then running back and
forth to Qeynos.
