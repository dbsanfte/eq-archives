1.  Don't take this newsgroup too seriously. It has an unusually high
percentage of malcontents and loonies. A good rule of thumb is that
even the same people are easier to get along with in the game than
they are in out-of-game forums.

2.  Don't get too attached to your first server or first character.
Try a variety of classes, races, and servers until you find one that
suits you.
