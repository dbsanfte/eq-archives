CS sucks rocks for exp. I mean it they nerfed the exp bad there
because of all the quad kiting. I was there this weekend killed 1
wyvern, a couple drakes, 4 Bulthar, and about 10 sirens and my
exp bar moved like it was stuck in glue. I got 'maybe' an 8th of a bubble.
I go to the moon kill 1 rockgrabber in Mons Letalis and *boom* 1/4 bubble
for one kill.

Get the hell out of CS.
