There is an item you can buy in the Plane of Knowledge (assuming you have
the Planes of Power expansion) that will help you locate your corpse.  I've
never used it so I don't know exactly what the name of the item is (wand of
something?) or how it works.  I assume that you put it in one of your
inventory slots and right-click it when you are in the zone with your corpse
and you will get continuing messages along the lines of "your corpse is
ahead and to the left" as you move around the zone.  If you go to PoK and
ask about it I'm sure plenty of people can tell you exactly what the item is
and who to buy it from.  You also have the /corpse command.  Setup a
hotbutton for it and run around "spamming" it as you run around the area you
think your corpse is in.  You should get "Your corpse is too far away..."
messages until you get within 50' of your corpse, at which time you'll get a
"Dragging Friben's corpse" message and your corpse will come to you.
