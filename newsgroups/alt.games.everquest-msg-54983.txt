Probably what happened was his group got trained out of the Sarnak Fort, he
zoned to keep from dieing, while healing/medding/whatever he heard your
shout ... asks you into group ... zones back in and back to the fort

A good high enough to invite you in should never get trained at the
backdoor, so it's probably a good thing you didn't join.
