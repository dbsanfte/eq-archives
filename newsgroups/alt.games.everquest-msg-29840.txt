Yes, it would be delightful says I speaking as a ranger. t one thing that
slightly iritates me that a ranger whose very symbol is a bow is you're 
not really that much better than other classes until very high level.
I guess that's hybridland though....

However I'm using a very basic ashwood bow, and damage 1 arrows and I am
hitting for typically 15-17 points of damage with a delay somewhere round
about 42-45 IIRC....which isnt too shabby when you root and let rip. PLus
you can run backwards shooting, change direction and auto realign to
shoot. Now I fletch my arrows myself and range 150 dam 1 arrows cost me a
coupla gold a stack, and I can if I want use smithing to limit the cost
even further.....spare metal bits, 20 arrowheads thank you.

Oh and with a stength od 100 and dex of about 85 I critical for 37 points
at the moment....it'll go up with better bows.

Not only that fletching will alow me to make arrows that hit magic
critters.....and if I get good enough at smithing the cost of that drops
through the floor.

Special arrows can be obtained of certain mobs...some like Whimsy
larktwitter can involve weeks of standing around and not seeing still
(bitter, me, no......), but some from the warrens I'm told are quite
common.

There's a wish list on eqrangers and gettng the skill to use poison on
arrows is cited there....(not make it...so as not to take a rogue skill
away, just use it)

In dungeons on a group raid if the warriors have really gone nuts up front
and block the corridor I will often root and shoot the caster behind them
or a big guy to help the warriors.....I can then do enough damage that the
right spell and taunt can rapidly pull the mob of the battered tank or the
nuker in double quick time....so its handy crowd control..altohugh as yet
I still tank better than arch myself....
