It's the war to get the 10th Coldain ring.  All the normal mobs in Great
Divide despawn, and waves of giants spawn, and attempt to make their way to
Thurgadin.  The objective is to kill all the giants.  The Nexus Scion also
despawns, so you can't use the spires to get out, however you can still port
in and out normally, gate normally, and also zone in and out of the adjacent
zones.
