Gold is much cheaper than buying all the bits.

Not as big a deal as most people make it out to be.

All the armor quest require you hang around home for 8-9 levels to get the
full set usually.

Actually, I myself prefer Qeynos or Halas for my first 5 levels.

6 to 16= The Warrens off of Paineel. I netted  (after spells and paying back

Luclin PC is good at 16, you should be 24 in less than 2 hours.

btw, why are they so good? Well, when they were putting in the code for
making life easier, they doubled xp gain below 10. They also decided to get
people in dungeons. Characters in a dungeon that are lower than level 30 get
2x xp as well. Add to that the 'new zone character attraction' xp bonus that
most luclin areas and The Warrens enjoy, and you are rockin.

At this point I recommend stopping to smell the roses. Look around. look for
interesting places on eqatlas, even if they are green to you, and explore.
