In the past WEEK I posted on a thread discussing Uqua (currently the "end
game" zone).. it doesn't get any higher in-game than this at present..

You are free to read whichever posts you like.. but just because you don't
see a newsgroup post with the subject "PING PALINDROME", and a message body
of my full character level/aa listings... well that doesn't mean they don't
exist. If you are too lazy to research what Uqua means, too lazy to research
my previous posts etc.. then try and cling onto your argument using some
retarded narrow method of identifying people... well don't be too surprised
that (sometimes multiple!) people make you eat your words.
