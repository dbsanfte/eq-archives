<<<I've had these cast on me and they don't seem to speed up my mana regen
rate.  
Do I need to be sitting down for them to take effect?  Or is the rate they 
speed up the regen just not very high?>>>>>>>>>

You are probably just a player that is lacking in any skill or talent for the
game at all.  If you are casting spells and they are using too much mana, then
you are doing something completely wrong.  If you ever have to sit down to
meditate, you are doing something wrong.  Your mana bar is not supposed to go
down at all if you know what you're doing.  You really shouldn't need any mana
regen spells like breeze or clarity cast on you in the first place.  They are
crutches that talentless players like yourself.  Maybe you should try playing
doom or diablo.
