Gotta troll them all!

It is incredible what prices people set. Refuse to pay them. There are
few drops you can't ever get without something called "work". Mind
you, the work is not easy, but it is doable, it wasn't made to be
easy.

"work" is something you parents do to pay off the credit card you run
up. I wonder why they don't notice you dealing with a scumbag like
Yantis.

AFAIAC, Yantis is criminally liable for whatever people do to scam
plat to sell for cash.
