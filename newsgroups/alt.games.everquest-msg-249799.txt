/agree.  I posted a while back in a similar thread to say why I think
the books (or some similar transport system) are necessary.  It had to
do with how the world IS larger and therefore the players are more
spread out, so you can't count on finding a group where you are and
thus have to be able to get to other places quickly.  The current
thread is an interesting idea, to require that every player (i.e. each
account) run to the various books once just to see the world, but I
agree that not everyone wants that, and it would lead to problems when
a group discovers that one of their members hasn't been to the book
they want to use, etc.

The "solution" I presented in the earlier thread was that SOE should
add a carrot, not a stick.  I.e., they should make it worthwhile for
people to explore more zones, but not make it a requirement.  The
particular idea I offered was to add roaming NPC encounters in zones
that were otherwise being overlooked, but I'm sure there are other
ways it could be done.
