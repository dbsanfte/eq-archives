I really had no problem with staying away from him.  However, he was
rude (or, at least, that's how it seemed to me at the time), moved in on
the relatively small area I was hunting and started telling me to back
off of kills I didn't think were clearly labeled as his kills.  I at no
time tried to make a big stink about it, I just stated how I felt about
the situation and he disagreed.  Since then I've learned that I was
wrong.  No big deal.

Same basic situation I was in, except that, through ignorance, I ended
up on the wrong side of the stick.

Sometimes it just works out that way.
