E.T.I.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

I hear the music, daylight disc
Three men in black said, "Don't report this"
"Ascension," and that's all they said
Sickness now, the hour's dread

All praise
He's found the awful truth, Balthazar
He's found the saucer news

I'm in fairy rings and tower beds
"Don't report this," three men said
Books by the blameless and by the dead
King in yellow, queen in red

All praise
He's found the awful truth, Balthazar
He's found the saucer news

Dead leaves always give up motion
I no longer fear emotion!
Where prophecy fails, the falling motion
"Don't report this, agents of fortune"

All praise
He's found the awful truth, Balthazar
He's found the saucer news
