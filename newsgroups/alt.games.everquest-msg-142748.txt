     Not I, and I sometimes play the silly battle cleric role (but
usually not while grouped, unless with just Lenny).  I didn't even
bother to use it when I soloed the Muglwump at 30, and there were really
only 2 or 3 spells that I used that entire fight.  Didn't even cross my
mind to scribe it, and killed it fine without it.

Annie <--- Not even sure she bought Yaulp two.
