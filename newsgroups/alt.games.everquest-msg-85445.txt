<<SNIPPED>>

I'm a 44 human monk who has been partnering with a barb shaman (he's
45 now) since we were both level 30.  Together we've done very well,
with him dying 3 times and me just once since we've gained these 14-15
levels.  The only time we've had problems has been in dungeons when
we've picked up adds.  You were right to say that crowd control is an
issue, but if the monk pulls to a "safe" place and the shaman roots
the mob before it runs you shouldn't have any problems.  Even if it
means the monk gets hit a few more times because the mob is rooted and
keeps fighting, it is much, much easier to finish it off standing
still than dodging 3 other mobs as well.

Remember, the monk's feign death ability is probably the most
important crowd control weapon you will have.  As the shaman, don't do
anything until he says he's ready for you to.  It's getting tougher
now that the mobs we're fighting are post-30 and FD no longer does a
consistent job memory wiping, but we still aren't having too many
problems.

Plus, if dungeon work gets tedious or dangerous, there's plenty of
outside zones with lots of room to work in to get xp.  We've gone from
Iceclad (snow cougars) to Rathe (giants) back to Iceclad (giants/dire
wolves) to EW, and countless Luclin zones for xp.  We're currently
holed up in EW and GD getting the giants good and mad at us.

Good luck, you 2 have picked the best mix of classes to partner with,
and things should start getting interesting.

Casidey,
Monk of the 44th Season..Xev
