on my server, fennin, i have found that since the patch, 60+ enc's are
charging 50p

first off, they are charging, not "accepting donations"

second, it's 50p, not 35p, not 100p......

i happen to also be a kei caster, so when i see one guy shouting for 50p, i
immediately join in and say something like "i am ALSO casting kei for 50p"

i do this in addition to sending tells to whoever the kei guy is (i know
most of them) saying "stick to your guns" or something

for the last few days, people have been very vocal with their distaste of
this practice

i do this in every zone where i see kei for 50p, and i have seen the 50p kei
sale being advertised in all the most common zones

i'm not sure how long we'll last until a scab comes along, but what's the
story on other servers?

are there KEI caster unions elsewhere? if so, do they work? all my enc
colleages are proud to be holding the price at 50p, but i'm very afraid one
will fall, and the rest will domino down

it's IMPOSSIBLE to keep the price at 50p since money > all .....

just curious i guess....how's it going elsewhere?
