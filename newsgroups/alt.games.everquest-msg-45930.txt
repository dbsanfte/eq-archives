Do it this way:

1. Add a new 8 slot container to the game.

2. When you go LD, the server checks to see if you have this
container.  If you do, it checks the contence for special runes.  The
presence of these runes tells the server what you want to do when LD.

3. Here are some of the runes that could be available:

  Rune of Escape : makes you try to cast gate
  Rune of Travel : makes you try to run to the nearest zone
  Rune of Stealth : makes you try to hide and/or sneak
  Rune of Feigning : makes you try to FD
  Rune of Deja Vu : repeats the previous rune until it works
  Rune of Despair : give up

4. The runes take effect in the order they are in the container, one
after the other, unless a Rune of Despair or Rune of Deja Vu is used.
For example, if you want your LD behaviour to be try once to
hide/sneak, then run to the zone, you'd use a Rune of Stealth and a
Rune of Travel.  If you want to keep trying hide/sneak until it works
or you get camped out, you'd put a Rune of Stealth and a Rune of Deja
Vu.

5. There can be quests for particularly powerful LD runes.  For
example, a Rune of Instant Escape, which would have an instant-cast
gate (this would also be usable as a right-click effect, so there is
no point in faking LD to use it).
