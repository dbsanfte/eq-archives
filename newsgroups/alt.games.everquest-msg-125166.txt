I still have a copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales around too. So what?

Just because I don't follow the bible myself doesn't mean I don't
recognize it as an important work. It has had a tremendous impact on
history, sometimes for good, sometimes not.

Besides which, if there were a book out there that was often quoted in
reference to you, wouldn't you want to keep it around for reference?
