It's hard not to get the impression you're boasting sometimes here.
Perhaps you don't mean it that way but that's sometimes the way it
comes across.

Of course it's nothing compared to some nights in the age chat.
There's a couple people here who seem to do nothing but brag about how
uber they are, to the point of describing the percentages of the uber
mobs they are killing, linking all the loot, status of their pulls,
and generally trying to impress everyone they can.
