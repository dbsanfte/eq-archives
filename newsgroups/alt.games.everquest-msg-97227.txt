Odd. I've never had trouble with those levels.

I see. So, the problem is a lack of appropriate level mobs. Then would
not the better solution be to improve the availability of such mobs,
not change the experience requirements?

Seems to me that you're cheering for the wrong solution to the
problem. I'll leave it to others to come up with amusing analogies to
demonstrate how absurd that is.

>None of those levels teach you anything but melee mob until dead.

Not entirely true. *All* of the levels 1-10 teach you basic mechanics
of the game, interaction with PCs and NPCs, geography of the local
area you're playing in, and so on.

As long time players it's easy to take these things for granted - I
know they're all second nature to me, I'm sure they are to you as
well. But to a newbie, they're vitally important to learn, preferably
before they're out in the larger world of non-newbie areas.
