Saying that a class with possibly the most boring job in EQ, almost
incapable of soloing, which has to blow serious plat to cast its most
essential buffs is "spoiled" is, well, probably not accurate. If you
disagree with this, start a cleric. :-) A main cleric, of course...
bots don't count. Your job is to stare at that screen and heal people.
If somebody dies, even if they're been grabing aggro from the MA
to the point where you're out of mana, well, sorry but it's still
your fault.

Personally I didn't use KEI even semi-regularly until I was well
above the minimum level where it now sticks. A good cleric generally
doesn't need it. Main exceptions are raids and the occasional situation
where the MOBs average high DPS and the cleric is sub-55 or so.

The response on the cleric boards for this change, by the way, has
mostly been very positive. No more being bugged by level 5s for Aego
or Hand of Virtue! As for low-levels having to manage without KEI...
aw, poor babies.
