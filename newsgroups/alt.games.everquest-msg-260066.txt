I hear that.

I've been taking a break from EQ for a couple of months now. I don't often
have the time to play, and usually when I do, someone else has to use the
computer. The fact that I hate soloing and the only groups I can ever find
are LDON groups. My main character is a lvl 52 Magician, has never hunted in
any planes, and is almost always low on platinum. Most his gear is early to
mid-40's range equipment, except for two or three items that were gifts.
Being poor most of the time doesn't exactly help.....

I'm going to be getting a new PC around the end of the year (this one is 4
years old), and when I do, I think I'll quit EQ altogether and give City of
Heroes a try.

(And no, I won't be giving my stuff away. Anything that I do give away will
go into my guild's bank, and I'll hold on to most of my equipment just in
case I do decide to come back.)
