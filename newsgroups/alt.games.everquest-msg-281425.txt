For me, it's a case of, make your own income and get upgrades however best
works for you.

I earned everything on my warrior, by playing my warrior.

In some cases, looting the no drop stuff he's wearing, questing items,
looting upgrades from groups, earning LDoN points, earning DoN crystals.

He's also bought items in the bazaar by winning items in groups, and
trading them on for cash.  To me, it's perfectly natural.  If something
drops in a group, and is valuable, then people should have a chance to win
it.  If you can use it, great, if not, you can trade it for something you
can use.  If you're lucky you can 1-for-1 trade it, if not, you sell it and
take a small loss in value, to then fund an upgrade elsewhere.

I haven't 'farmed' anywhere for loot, or for spiderling silks, or for any
serious income.  I've sold what I've won, and bought upgrades.

These days, I co-lead once-a-week raids with people from four family
guilds, and get a few upgrades that way, or I earn or buy DoN crystals and
get major upgrades from there, or I hunt quest drops for OoW tier 1 armour
and get upgrades via that route.

I'm proud of the gear my warrior is wearing, every bit was earned in some
way, by playing the game on that toon.
