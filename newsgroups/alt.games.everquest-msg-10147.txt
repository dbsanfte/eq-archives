The Boots are purchased from the Gnome Vendor in SOL A same vendor that
sells the Tinkerers Bag. It will be a bit risky to go in alone but with a
partner (tank type) you should have no problem. I have gone in with a 35
monk eveything is Green and have not lost more then 1 and a half bubs of
health mainly from a wizard.

The SOW effect lasts about as long as a normal SOW, by what I have been told
by a Bard on prexus you can cast the SOW on the run just like JBoots.

I have not tested the Travellers Boot but have been told it is the same as
JBoots. JBoots are about 5-10% slower then a normal SOW, which is more then
fast enough to kite with. If running with someone that has a regular SOW you
will see them slowly pull ahead of you
