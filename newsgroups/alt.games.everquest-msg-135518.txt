It's difficult to tell what's an upgrade without a hint as
to your level, current stats and equipment...

All of these items should be under 1000pp, at least, and
you can probably get two items for most combinations:

Face:  Velium Ruby Veil  (Plat instead of velium only
    drops 1 of each stat and is about half the price)
    +8 STR +8 WIS
Head:  Sebilite Scale Cap
    +12 AC +4 Str +4 Wis +4 Int +2 vsMg +2 vsPos
Wrist:  Bracers of the Reverent
    +9 AC +5 Wis
Shoulder:  Adamantite Epaulets
    +9 AC +7 Wis
Back:  Mammoth Hide Cloak
    +7 AC +4 Wis +5 vsCold
Feet:  Crystal Lined Slippers
    +5 AC +3 Wis +3 Int

The Wrist and Shoulder slots will last you a LONG time,
though:  upgrades to those slots are either expensive
or drop off of high-level mobs.  I didn't replace them
until I hit 55, I think.

Depending on race and current equipment, you can pick
other upgrades with a focus on AC instead of WIS.  And,
depending on level and gear, some items could be better
than others due to resists, etc.  Like I said, it's
hard to tell without knowing your stats and level.  At
one point, for instance, my gnome cleric had WIS in
every slot (and relatively weak AC) because he had such
a low starting WIS (only 97 with all points put into WIS
at creation.)  A dwarf cleric wouldn't have to make the
same choices.
