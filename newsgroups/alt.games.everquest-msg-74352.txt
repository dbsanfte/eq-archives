/agree
That would eliminate the need for having people either;
1.) Violate the TOS by making a new account with a shared userid and PW
for everyone to access the banker. (Or at least all the officers)
or
2.) Somebody having to use up one of their character slots to be the
guild banker and constantly get interrupted and have to log off/on to go
take care of somebody's guild banking needs.

Any guild, or at least the ones with more than "x" members, should be
able to have the guild master/mistress set up such a bank account. Not
sure how hard that would be to code, but it would be a godsend.
