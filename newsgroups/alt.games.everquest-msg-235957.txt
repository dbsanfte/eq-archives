CoM entry was too cluttered for me, fearkiting anything leads you off into
thw wilds and the vegetation and all heck can leap out on you.
Dreadlands is good, round the edges you can pick up plenty of animals and
see for miles plus you get the advantage of seeing if any groups need a
DPS.
Velious also have areas that are still good for you. EW has a fair amount
DB that is animal based. Geos in CC are easily handlable at that level.
You might try the Wakening Lands over by the Skyshrine zone line and the
raptors.
Oh and you are definitely in Jaggedpine territory. Griffs there are
mindnumbingly boring to kill (well OK that is fearkiting in general) but
very effective.
