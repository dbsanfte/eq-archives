Does this mean I'll no longer be able to indulge my whimsical side
by putting those "worth 100pp if you can be bothered to sit around
in auctionland for hours selling it" weapons on orc pawns for the
newbies to find and loot?

Does this mean more Phat Lewt?  Or just a higher drop rate?  What
is an improved drop rate and how do I sign up for one?  What would
really improve Luclin, as far as I'm concerned, would be a druid
and wizard port to nexus.  Currently getting groups up for Luclin
work means an average 7 minute delay over and above all the normal
concerns of "joebob is banking, Misskitty  is finishing up a quest,
Sirrezalot has to go CR a buddy" and so forth
