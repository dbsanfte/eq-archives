If the best haste is *necessary* for whatever your group is camping, you
clearly have to use it. If your 2nd (or 3rd or 4th...) best haste is *good
enough* for whatever your group is camping, though, why not use that
instead? Especially if it costs less mana, has a longer duration, and has
other bonuses?? Even if the enchanter's mana is the regulating factor
for how fast you can go through mobs??

I *just* got Augmentation. Is it your contention that by level 29 there's
nothing left in the game worth killing that a melee heavy group can kill
with "only" 20-28% haste?
