I've considered that. Though if that is the case, any other good quests that
a DE Necro can enjoy doing that might involve a bit of travel?  Or now that
I'm almost LV12 (and get bind) any good interesting places to hunt?

I wish they'd let pets carry 4 items (you can give them 4 items, so why not
carry 4).
    Though I've given my pet items from corpses while at the orc camp (no
one else was looting them so I decided to clean up the place so we could see
easier) and the pet started doing worse in battle.  Any truth to this or
just my bad luck of confusing the hell out of an already pretty stupid pet.
