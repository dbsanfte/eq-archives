Are you serious?  Are you really claiming that, for instance, when
a mob cornered in its lair is defeated by a lucky turn of the RNG
by the sole surviving member of a group of 6 characters, that mob
has chosen "a path of totally *ineffectual* combat"?  Are you
insisting that the single casualty suffered by a horde of mobs who
overwhelm and obliterate a group of hapless PCs shows that the
tactics employed by the victors are "totally *ineffectual*"?  How
about the handful of casualties suffered in the course of wiping a
90 PC raid force, are they also proof that the victorious mobs are
engaging in "totally *ineffectual* combat"?

The mere fact that you insist I should point out something so
utterly and completely obvious suggests strongly that you are:
a) being an idiot,
b) uncaring as to whether your posts make the least bit of sense,
c) using the words "totally ineffectual" in a unique manner that
is not shared by any other user of the English language,
d) accurately described by all of the above and many similar
comments that are far less flattering.


kaev <--- who's posted some stupid things to this group, but would
like to imagine that he's never been so "totally *ineffecctual*"
as our beloved MP in this thread
