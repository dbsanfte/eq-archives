Actually, it has been mentioned, and I've noticed a few cases, that
some mobs in CoM *will* turn to flee... and they invariably end up
being mobs that have some sort of magic loot on them.

Coincidence? Design? Not sure, but so far it's always been the case
that in the rare cases where a mob does run away, its got some loot.
Perhaps it just doesn't want you to get it. =)

(And can't believe you've not picked up a wraithbone hammer by now.
Seemed to be a dime a dozen in CoM)
