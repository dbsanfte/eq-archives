I spent 17 to 20 with my ranger in the Karanas - South, North, but mostly
East due to close fletching supplies - and in Lake Rathe when the Arena camp
was open. With the exception of about one full level in Lake Rathe, I soloed
almost all of that.

In  East Karana (and repeated elsewhere), just target your mob on tracking
and come up on him. Root, snare, and start plucking arrows into it from
about 3/4 max distance. When root breaks, run away backwards, preferably
heading in the area of the bridge so as to offer a quick escape if you back
into Proon or something. (which I did once) With the mob snared, you can
root again and pluck more arrows at a standstill. Rinse, repeat. Merchants
nearby to sell off loot (though the loot in EK is poorer than in many
zones), and plenty of arrows on hand.

Problems: Arena and High Hold are probably your closest bind points, and
they make for a LONG corpse run. Also, no banks nearer than High Hold as
well.

In Rathe and South Karana, plenty of camps to get into. I hate SK - too
crowded with too many idiots, far too much zone spam, and some of the worst
groups I've been in - but Rather in nice and quiet, with good,
self-contained camps.
