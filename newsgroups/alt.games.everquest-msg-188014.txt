Okey, admittedly, I'm not a Wizard, but a Druid, but I have PoP, and 
last time I checked, my port spells were still in my book. I think I'd 
probably have heard more of an outcry from Wizards if those spells had 
actually been removed.

Any Wizard players can confirm that their ports and TL's have been 
removed? Jazz?
