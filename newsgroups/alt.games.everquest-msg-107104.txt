You have no idea how delightful it is to a veteran (like me) to see a
newbie ask. All too often newbies just plow in, making their early
Usenet experiences unhappy for them and others.

For searching usenet archives, there is flat out no better tool. I've
never used it for posting or browsing, so I can't comment on that.

If you decide to try a more 'pure' approach, I recommend getting a
GigaNews (www.giganews.com) account - their cheapest offering is about
eight bucks a month - and a copy of Free Agent (www.forteinc.com).

>1. What is a killfile? If it is a user tool, how is it implemented?

I'd be surprised if it's implemented in Google. In dedicated
newsreader software it's a way to filter posts that you don't want to
see based on a variety of criteria. For example, you can block posts
by a certain author, with a certain subject line, or an entire thread.
Different software has different options.

>2. Why is it that sometimes I don't see certain postings in a thread,
>but others are obviously replying to them?

People may have the no-archive flag set so that Google doesn't show
them, or you could simply be seeing bad propagation. The way newsgroup
posts travel is akin to the black arts, so things sometimes arrive out
of order, or not at all.

The above-mentioned Giganews virtually never misses posts.

>3. Who the heck is this Bizbee character and why can't I see his posts
>sometimes?

He is an entertaining, though generally caustic, old-time poster. He
tends to piss people off regularly, but a great deal of the time his
take on a situation is right on the money. In other words, he's quick
to point out bullshit.

He often uses the no-archive flag, as his posting habits over the
years tend to attract Usenet stalkers. That's actually easy to do.
Several of us here have had our own pet stalkers on occasion.
