Raw exp points are not the whole story.  Remember that the mobs you're
fighting at 60 give more raw exp per kill than the ones you fight
at 45.

So even though level 60 takes 3.17 times as much raw exp to get
through as level 45, it actually only takes 1.5 times as many
kills (presuming you're fighting blue mobs 12 levels below you at
both 45 and 60).

The required number of kills is what actually determines how
quickly you can see the exp bar go up.

And it takes a lot *fewer* kills to get through 60 than through
54, 55, 56, 57, 58, or 59.

Furthermore, it's likely that a group of 60's can chew through
mobs with less downtime (or death) than a group of 45's.
