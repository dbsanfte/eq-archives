Parsed the level 55 Shammy pet with Celerity, Infusion of Spirit and Spirit
Quickening on non-PoP level 50 mobs at between 14 and 26 DPS over about 40
fights.  Dual wielding Velium weapons added about 5 DPS so that explains the
variance (he didn't start off wielding any weapons) plus oddities like when
Dogdog had to tank for 30 seconds or so as his DPS dropped a bit due to
ripostes and the like.

YALP and EQCompanion gave broadly the same figures.
