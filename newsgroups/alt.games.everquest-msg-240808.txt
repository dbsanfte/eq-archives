My my, how long did you spend going back through my tens of thousands
of usenet posts? You're not going to show up on my doostep, are you,
my lying, bigotted, hypocritical stalker, are you?

The list of people I've been in flamewars with is very long and
distinguished. Few of those, however, have lost as sorely and as badly
as you.

You'd think you'd take a hint from the fact NO ONE IS SUPPORTING YOU,
not even the other people here who would love to take a shot at me,
dumbass.

I do not think wrestling is real. I do, however, think its funny, or
it was when I watched it last years ago. As for rsp-w, interestingly I
go there mostly for the political posts. It is also a very funny
newsgroup. Refreshingly lacking in any sort of inhibition, the best
internet links and stories get posted there. :-)


>Time for some swearing now I warrant Mr Sisson.

You have yet to do anything that would warrant it. Someone making a
fool out of themself as soundly as you are just makes me laugh. :-)
