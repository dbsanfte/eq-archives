Actually I'm well aware of the difference.  A theory
isn't a fact, it's a theory.

Not when they're talking about facts.  They're dodgy about putting
the "fact" label on theories, as they should be.

Theories are based on faith in science and interpretation
of facts based on that faith.  Take evolution, for example:
the underlying assumption is there is a science-based
rationale for some observed facts.  That may be right or
it could all be wrong.  It's *not* a "fact."  It's a theory
used to explain facts, based on faith in science.  Nothing
in the evolution *facts* rule out intervention by a Creator;
he could just be making new things to replace old things
that don't work well anymore.   To get to an evolution
theory, one needs to assume -- based on faith -- there
is a scientific reason for the observations.
