I often use the root one to pull the other method, however, I just keep 
rerooting the one I originally rooted to keep it out of the fray.  If it 
is not a summoning mob, I also drop my epic dot on it while I am 
concentrating on killing the one that I pulled.  Of course, I can take a 
bit more of a beating than your average wizard.  I use this method both 
with and without a pet, depending on how likely a pet is to survive 
against the mobs in question.
