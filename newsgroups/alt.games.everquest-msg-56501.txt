Old world mobs don't have an "ah, screw it" radius.  If you're
on the hate list, they will twist time and warp space to beat on
your ass.  If you _didn't_ zone or _didn't_ mem-blur or something
to that effect, and they didn't come after you, you were never
on the hate list in the first place.

Only in Kunark and Velious do you have to worry about
out-running a mob "too far."  Sucks for pulling outside,
good for escaping outside, especially if you just want to hit
the zone line anyways.
