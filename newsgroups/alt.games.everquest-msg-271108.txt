90 bucks is almost reasonable.  If you have friends who're in the 20s and you
want to hang with them, this saves the first 25 hours of catchup.  It's
probably a real character that someone played for awhile, then decided to
leave the game. 

Powerlevelling may be hard enough that it never really picks up as an industry
in EQ2.  This is good, IMO.  Actual buying of accounts is kind of neutral in
my opinion, but can exacerbate problems of bad game design. 

Coin and item transfer can be more problematic, as it has interesting
effects on in-game economy (both good and bad), but again, it's a game
design problem if it's too harmful.

So did Sony.  Public stances are cheap.

Indeed. mysupersales.com has accounts and gold for sale, both for WoW and EQ2.
Doesn't look like either company is really cracking down very much.  Again,
this doesn't bother me, as I don't think it hurts the game much, if at all.
