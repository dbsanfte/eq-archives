Ditto here for the most part though my 30 druid earned the plat that
bought the crystal grinder hehehe.  Nothing like fearkiting mammoths in
everfrost to rake in plat and experience for a solo player in the 20's
to low 30's that i have found yet.

You got lucky, i was averaging more like 200-250 a piece and I never one
a freaking roll in Cazic other than on the lizardscale mantle, that as a
rogue I didn't need.  Wound up buying every piece that dropped from
whoever won the roll.

Ahh good to know.  I guess i am suffering from twink envy some, you see
so many buying it, and wearing that you start to feel that maybe your
armor is sub par.  I definitely like my Ryygor helm though, it replaced
a exe hood, so after 40 levels of being bear headed I am now bare headed
heheh.

I am working on my BR quest, but kind of stalled again, need to go get
the sparkle purse.  I have most of my alcohols, still need the one from
OOT.

Actually getting similar with my SCH my str is somewhere around 135
unbuffed, and usually grouping with two shamans it's up around 150 or so
i think buffed.  The lower delay of the Trak tooth would/will be nice
though.

The procs don't build too much hate for you?  I know at least some rogue
guides say Procs are bad because of the extra taunt involved.  I would
imagine to some extent that it depends on the tanks involved and how
well they build agro.
