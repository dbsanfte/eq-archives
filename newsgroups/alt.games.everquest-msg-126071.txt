Aye, you are right. However, a new Interface is in the works, to be
implemented very soon. I think someone posted a screenshot of it. As for
melee skills, that was somewhat fixed with the monk class and its various
disciplines. Though, I've never played DAoC, so I don't know how they stack
up. I can vouch for one thing, the world is HUGE. I mean, there's stuff
there I never even knew about. For example, about 5 months into my EQ
playing, I started a new human character. I hunted outside of the gate to
the city of freeport, as I did with many of my Human and Half-elf
characters.  Once, I was walking along a wall, and hit a hidden wall I never
knew was there, leading to an underground labyrinth intended for Evil races.
Some Evil races are not welcome in Freeport, and thus must use this
underground area to pass through the city. A very nice touch that I never
even knew about until a few months in.

Anyways, thats my 2 cents.
