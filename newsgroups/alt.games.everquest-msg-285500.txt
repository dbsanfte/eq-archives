It's much like PC aggro, with 2 exceptions.  There is a small amount of aggro
transfer from pet to owner, and there is a VERY irksome "rule of 3".  A mob
will completely ignore any aggro it has on a pet if there are more than 3
entities on it's hate list.

This means if you're soloing, or duoing with a non-pet class, your pet can
tank, and keep aggro if you're careful.  If you have three players and a pet,
or two players and 2 pets, the mob will ignore the pets and come after the
owners.
