Thats really too bad.    The first season does start off very slow, and is
very reminicient of DS9, which was competing with it at the time.  And the
ongoing plot (as opposed to single episode plots only loosely related) had
not had much time to become apparent.

To be honest, I was of the same opinion when I first saw it.  Doing the Star
Trek, where they promise grand space battles, but then sign a peace treaty
at the last moment, just in time to save the special effects budget.

What turned it around for me was that one time, I managed to catch the start
of a 3'rd season episode.   Just the opening credits.   That was enough.
More special effects than I had seen in a year of Star Trek, and Ivonnova
reading the line

"The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace. It failed.
But, in the Year of the Shadow War, it became something greater: our last,
best hope... for victory. The year is 2260. The place: Babylon 5. "

I watched the episode, and a lot of the remaining ones.   Then watched all
the reruns in order on TNT when they were showing them 5 days a week.    I
was not disappointed, in story, dialogue, special effects or anything.
