Suppose I get *2* disease dots on me, a 6-counter dot and a 3-counter dot.
Do I have to have all 9 counters removed before either of the dots go away?
Or are the counters attached to the dot itself?

Do the counters fall off over time? Imagine a 2-minute disease dot with 6
counters. After a minute, are there only 3 counters left? Or do all 6
counters stay until the very end?

Just askin' ...
