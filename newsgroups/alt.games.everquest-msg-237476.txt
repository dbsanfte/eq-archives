MyBoyfriend had to Close his computer repair business for exactly this
reason, people didn't think it was fair to charge them for their failing
hard disk/messed up windows install/messing it up once he had done his job,
so they were trying to get him to do all these extra jobs for free.
Unfortunately being a nice person he did tend to do this, not a good way to
run a buisiness.
