Or you can convince a cleric friend to come kill them for you.  Cobalt drakes
are a cleric's dream, a mob that moves as slowly as if it were snared.  If only
they were undead you'd never see clerics in any other zone, but even so, an mob
with low HP that is easily feared and runs away so slowly that you can catch it
with TBoots and get your nukes off before it runs out of range, thats a pearl
beyond price.  Add in the fact that they are rarely hunted (most sane people
steer clear of mobs with Vox breath; 500 damage AE with a 4 slot debuff
included) and drop an average of 40pp of loot apiece... well I killed every one
that popped, and worked sea chests and wyverns (a more challenging kill,
actually) in between.

Bergh, 65 cleric, 42 - 54 spent at least half each level soloing in CS

ps make sure that lovely plump drake isn't Azureake
