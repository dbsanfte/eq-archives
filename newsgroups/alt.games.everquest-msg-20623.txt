Tower Of Frozen Shadow, sort of.  You need a key that drops from a mob on 
each level to get to the next level (levels are not separate zones there, 
it's one zone with 7 or 8 levels depending on how you count).  On each 
level there is a portal that will take you back outside, but they tend to 
be hidden.  What gets interesting is that if your entire party dies while 
up in the tower, you'll have to camp mobs on the previous floors for their 
keys again - and you'll have to do it naked as all your equipment is on 
your corpses upstairs.

"Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all
who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no
mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past.
Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-
perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
