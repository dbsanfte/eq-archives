The best thing to do is to group with people and when you are grouped with
someone who is in a guild to ask them about the guild. If you have already
grouped sucessfully with a member of the guild you are much more likely to
be easily accepted into many guilds.

Most guilds have websites. So you can either use google to find it or ask
a random member of the guild where it is. The website will generally tell
you
about the guild and also let you see just how active it really is.

What I'd do is pick a random person in a guild that you might be interested
in
and send them a tell asking if there is an officer of their guild on and
then
send the officer a polite tell saying that you are looking for a guild to
join and
would like to know more about theirs.  Unless you have a specific purpose
in mind I'd suggest you want a guild with a reasonable number of members
(At least 20 people logged on during peak times) and who are active in
that they arrange stuff to do at least once or twice every week, preferrably
almost every day. Also I'd suggest looking on server message boards for
stuff about the guild - making sure they don't get involved in all the petty
fights that some guilds seem to get draw into.

Most guilds I know of have a minimum level to join. Often around 25-30. I'm
talking about general guilds here - not raiding guilds. It makes sure people
are
serious abouit wanting to join if they've got to that level and also the
game
changes slightly at around level 30 in that grouping becomes more necessary
for many classes and people from 30 to about 40 can group together. Below
that level it's different.
