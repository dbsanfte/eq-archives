One of the options I'm really considering for the Progression server is 
a wizard, its one of the few classes I really haven't played, other than 
getting one up to 10th level just a few days ago in a run of "lets try 
this out and see how I like it" characters.

Anyway, I was thinking about the spell list and got to wondering again, 
What Were They Thinking?

1 	True North 5 mana

OK, this prize winner has been useless since they gave everyone a 200 in 
sense direction, not that it was good for much before that.  It is now 
good for nothing but getting your skill up in divination at a relatively 
low cost.

1 	Sphere of Light 10 mana	Conjures a sphere of energy that provides 
light in dark areas. 	Create Item (Summon Utility)

Nearly useless, the light it provides is very dim, but there are night 
blind wizard races (human and erudite) and I guess it could be handy for 
making a CR run in the Everfrost/Blackburrow tunnel or something. 
Mostly good for raising Conjuration cheaply

1 	Minor Shielding 10 mana	Surrounds your body in a magical shield, 
increasing your hit points, armor class, and magic resistance. 	HP Buffs 
(Shielding)

A perfectly good line of buffs, no problem here.

1 	Numbing Cold 	6 mana Covers nearby creatures in a numbing cold, 
causing between 14 and 14 damage. 	Direct Damage (Cold)

A PB AE nuke, so tiny it won't even kill off level one creatures, good 
for two things: 1) getting credit for kills when you are being PL'd via 
DS, and 2) teaching newbie wizards that casting AE spells can spell 
serious trouble.  In theory its a great spell, because it can hit a very 
large number of creatures, so you're doing 10 or 20 or even 70 times 14 
damage for just 6 mana.  But getting that payoff is difficult until 
you've got either a big enough AE nuke to really wipe everything you've 
aggroed out, or an enchanter or two capable of laying down a solid wall 
of PBAE Stunnage.

1 	Frost Bolt 6 mana	Creates a bolt of frost that freezes your target, 
causing between 9 and 14 damage. 	Direct Damage (Cold)

9 damage for 6 mana, 1.5 ratio.  14 damage for 6 mana, 2.33 ratio, not 
bad, and it teaches the benefits and dangers of the Bolt line


1 	Blast of Cold 	8 mana Covers your target in a thin layer of frost, 
causing between 11 and 18 damage. 	Direct Damage (Cold)

11 damage for 8 mana;1.375.  18 damage for 8 mana; 2.25.  Slightly worse 
than the bolt line, but without the tricky LOS rules.  On the other 
hand, recent LOS patch made the bolt less of a difficulty., and bolt has 
better range too.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2 	O'Keils Radiation 15 mana	Surrounds your target in radiating flame 
that damages any creature that strikes them. 	Utility Beneficial (Damage 
Shield)

Sadly, this doesn't stack with mage/druid DS, and its pretty tiny, so 
its not of much use; the mana cost and the short duration don't help either.

2 	Glimpse 5 mana	Grants your eyes magical acuteness, allowing you to 
see clearly over long distances for 12 seconds. 	Utility Beneficial (Vision)

Umm.  Ever have problem seeing your target over a 300 range?  I can't 
think when I'd ever use this.  For a ranger, or anyone else capable of 
weilding a really really long range combo of bow and arrow, glimpse can 
actually be pretty handy.  But I don't think that within bolt range, its 
ever going to matter.

3 	Root 	30 mana Causes the earth to adhere to your target's feet, 
preventing them from moving for up to 42 seconds - 48 seconds. 	Utility 
Detrimental (Root)

Incredibly useful, root and shoot is a great wizard plan.  Pity root 
breaks so easily, and the 30 mana cost is outlandish at 3rd level, but 
still, this is a core spell and will be massively cheap later when it 
deserves more use.  At low levels, its better to tank the mobs down.

3 	Fade 10 mana	Teleports you a short distance away in a random 
direction. 	Utility Beneficial (Shadowstep)

Doesn't seem to wipe mob aggro, I can't think of a use for this, since 
I'd have to stop to cast it, if I'm that far ahead of the mobs I should 
probably just keep on running to the zone line.

4 	Shock of Fire 	10 mana Surrounds your target in fire, causing between 
14 and 20 damage. 	Direct Damage (Fire)

14/10 is 1.4 ratio, 20/10 is 2.0.  Not much of an upgrade over the level 
1 spells, particularly when you consider that they are cheaper to cast

4 	See Invisible 	25 mana Places a magical enchantment upon your 
target's eyes, allowing them to see otherwise invisible creatures for 21 
minute - 27 minutes. 	Utility Beneficial (Vision)

And I'm likely to care about invisible creatures at this level why?  I 
guess this would help in a PvP server.  And in the long run it will come 
in handy.  But its a "back of the book" special.



4 	Gate 	70 mana Opens a magical portal that returns you to your bind 
point. 	Transport (Misc)

Key spell, of course, as any non gate class can tell you.  Wizards get a 
whole line of these, though, so its marginally less important to them 
than to other classes... except that because they do get other options, 
its easier for them to Bind near their fight spot, knowing that when 
they want to leave the area, they won't have to walk.  Eventually.  At 
the moment, well, its still just as useful as it is for every other 
caster.  Funny they don't include it in the tutorial spell merchants, 
but you can walk out of tutorial, buy it, and teleport back in.  Of 
course at low levels, 70 mana is outlandishly expensive and doesn't make 
much of an escape spell.

5 	Fire Bolt 28 mana	Creates a bolt of fire that burns your target, 
causing between 45 and 65 damage. 	Direct Damage (Fire)

45/28=1.6, 65/28=2.32.  Nice upgrade, does noticable damage where the 
old spells are starting to look like tickling the mobs.

5 	Fingers of Fire 	Evokes a number of thin flames to rise around you, 
causing between 19 and 28 damage to all nearby creatures. 	Direct Damage 
(Fire)

OK, as much as we didn't need one PBAE, this one is even sillier, the 
lessons that could be learned are already learned, the ability to help 
yourself get PL'ed is already there, and cheaper.  And this still 
doesn't do enough damage to wipe out a bunch of level one attackers. 
Waste of a spell.

6 	Lesser Shielding 	Surrounds your body in a magical shield, increasing 
your hit points, armor class, and magic resistance. 	HP Buffs (Shielding)

Its a good line.

6 	Icestrike 17 mana	Calls down a cascade of sleet that falls in three 
waves, causing 46 damage to all creatures in the vicinity of your 
target. 	Direct Damage (Cold)

17 mana.  For 46 damage, would be 2.7.  But its three waves.  Land two 
and thats 5.4, land all three and thats a whopping 8.11 damage to mana 
ratio.  But wait there's more, its also AE, which means you can double, 
triple, even quadruple your output if you can get some mobs to stand 
still, close together, under the rain.  Imagine, 32.44 damage per mana! 
  OK, so thats tricky to arrange, but two isn't so bad with a competant 
tank, and I usually only see one of the three waves resisted.  Thats a 
10.8 ratio, still head and shoulders above anything else so far.  I used 
this one a lot even on targets I was meleeing... and when meleeing, I 
didn't have to worry about whether the tank could keep them from 
aggroing on me and walking out from under the rain.

7 	Shadow Step 	Causes you to momentarily step into the realm of shadow, 
reentering reality a short distance away. 	Utility Beneficial (Shadowstep)

This seems useless, just like fade.  Whats the point of this line... at 
least up to Succor levels, when it actually ditches aggro for you.


7 	Sense Summoned 	Provides you with a mystical awareness, pointing you 
towards the nearest summoned creature. 	Utility Beneficial (Summoned)

What the heck is this for?  I don't see a one anti summoned nuke. 
Summoned mobs are among the rarest in the game.  Rarely do they carry 
anything of interest.  Why exactly am I likely to care about this one? 
Sense caster type mob, now, that I'd be excited about, "Nuke THIS"!

=====================================================================
I'd give any one of those spells, but especially any of the totally 
useless ones, for a short duration snare, single or AE, doesn't matter, 
even if its as ineffective and short duration as Clinging Darkness, a 
big chunk of a wizard's job is snaring, and most of his solo ability is 
snare based... but he can't start doing so until what, 34?

I'll grant you, you can say much the same of a shaman and his pet (a boy 
and his dog) but that doesn't make it right.
