Morell-Thule and I merged with E-Marr.  To tell the truth I was
somewhat amazed at the population difference.  Obviously you would
expect zones to be more full after a merge but MT was obviously the
more underpopulated of the two and apparently it was less-populated by
a great degree.  After OoW had been out for a while, it was very common
that you would zone in to WOS or MPG and see 2 people in the zone.
Newbie Zones?  On MT, often you were lucky if you could pull together a
group in Overthere or DSP, let alone the less populated zones.  These
days a lot of former ghost towns are quite surprisingly (to me) very
well populated.  high level pick-up groups are very easy for my ranger
and necro to grab these days.  LFG goes up and an invite comes very
quick.  Lavastorm usually has ~30 people in it (indicating quite a few
more actually doing missions.)  RSS, MPG, WOS almost always populated.
You can often get pick-up groups in most other OoW zones.  PoK?  Maybe
250 +/- in the zone in the evenings?  I dont know how that compares on
other servers.

As far as attitudes?  Yeah there are kids.  There will always be
kiddies I'm sure, but most people I group with in pick-up groups are
decent players.  One thing I noticed is that there is no where near the
drama on EM that there used to be on MT.  Part of that is probably the
growth in popularity of instanced zones, so some of the crap people
pulled on MT may have also been a problem on EM in the past.  But my
impression is that they have not had anywhere near the load of idiots
we had on MT.

The rants section of the server homepage is dead.  Here's a link:

No one is complaining.  No one is bitching about jack, there is no
drama.  Now for those who thought that the insult-fest we used to have
on MT was a grand old time, this may be a bad thing.  But I consider it
a pretty good sign that people must be getting along fairly well.
