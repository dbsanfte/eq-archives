I can't grasp what the people at verant are trying to do. While passing thru
Runny I fought a neophyte which conned light blue. I had to zone out because
he was beating the hell outta me. I've fought several light blue mobs which
either forced me to zone or killed me. So I say to myself , "why fight a
light blue con because the exp is not worth the trouble when I can kill
several high blue mobs which are easier to take down". I don't get what
verant is doing .. why have mobs in game that aren't worth killing ?
