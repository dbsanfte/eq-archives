This is twice you've claimed "jasper and less than 1% exp"

Jasper might be on the table, but so are blue diamonds and raw diamonds, worth
substantially more than a jasper.

Personally I'd still give the crap away to anyone so needy that they might
actually wear the stuff... after all, even a raw diamond is no big deal.

But if you really don't believe that the "young necros" are going to wear it,
then you might as well roll, since it is now worth a shot at a few hundred
pp... which may well be what they are planning to use it for, protestations to
the contrary.
