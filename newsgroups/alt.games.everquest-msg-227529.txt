Im not familiar with the DKP system terminology, however our guild is
a major raiding guild (ranked 3 on Povar) & we use a merit points
system.  Theres pages of the stuff as to how it works on our boards
(http://pub125.ezboard.com/bfuforcesunknown9695) however in a
nutshell:

You earns points for every raid - a raid being 18 or more members
including an officer per main mob challanged.

Every item off every raid mob has a cost allocated to it.

When an item drops, if you have sufficent points you can request it
from an officer.  They will then decide who gets it based on thier
overall points, the points they earned in the last month & in some
cases the overall benefit to you over another who has requested it.

If you get it your points are deducted from your bank.

It is complicated, it causes all sorts of arguments, its a pain for
the officers to run but despite that it seems to work.  There is a lot
of data parsing going on behind the scenes & we have some members who
are handy at database development to keep all this lot in check & the
results posted to the boards on a daily basis.
