I have little doubt about that.

I don't think it's ok, but there's not much I can do from where I am.  Being
2000 miles from home pretty well prevents you from influencing your choice
of candidates.

It's mainly the gridlock that's kept us safe.  When they're fighting each
other, they're too busy to encroach on our personal rights.

We don't officially.  However, when it comes to how laws are applied, it's
always the christians to whom the first ammendment doesn't apply.

Nah, my server just pushed your posts out of the cache, so I couldn't check

It is exemplary in comparision to all other economic models in use today.  I
wouldn't even call it the lesser of many evils.  It's more of a transparent
system, at worst.  We always hear how communism would work with perfect
people.  Well, capitalism would also work (in fact, it would still be
superior, as it would allow every person to contribute what they could
without the pains of strict regulation) with perfect people.  However,
capitalism can also work well with imperfect people.

Who said anything about defining?  We define the groups to fit a certain
cluster of beliefs.  I've never understood why some people are so determined
to not fit into a category that they shun labels, no matter how useful they
may be.

A conservative politician is much more likely to do something I like, that's
why he's considered conservative.  It's kinda like how I'm considered
partisan because I pretty much will never vote for a democrat.  I'm told I
should "vote for the person, not the party."  Well, if the party would stop
sending up people who's politics I loathe, maybe I would.  Yet, it's not the
Democrat party's failure to reach out to conservative voters that's the
issue, it's clearly my own rigid thinking.
