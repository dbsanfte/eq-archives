It takes precisely 225 hp, not 300.  Use with your inventory
screen up staring at your numerical HP total, do -not- click
if you are under 225.

Its a 44 mage spell, and the most important one you'll get
at that level if you are going to group or go on raids (I guess
it isn't that big a deal if you are straight solo mage... and
never get res's when you die.)

As a cleric I regularly consume mass quantities of the
things during mass res events.  This way the mages
are feeding me mana, the non-res healers keep my HP
up with -their- mana, the necros feed me mana directly...
my record thus far is 23 res in under 20 minutes, much
of which was used waiting for people to reply to
/tell (dead guy) ready?

Every member of your party (or raid) should be given
one of these to hold, made during times when you
are FM.  Casters can use em to alleviate the OOM
blues if things get rough, but more importantly
you can take it off your body to hand to the cleric
ressing you if one of those mass deaths has occured.

Even if its only the one mage that died, dropping all
mana on the floor in the form of rods before being
ressed is the thing to do if you can get back to your
body before it happens.  This means the cleric will
end up FM and you will have a substantial amount
of mana too, instead of having to med up from OOM.
