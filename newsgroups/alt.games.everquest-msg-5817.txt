If tonight was any indication, my 27 monk (now in Dalnir. working toward
Cresent bearing Klys) will be 30 before long. I noticed that the Monk
disciplines starting at lvl 30 are only available to owners of the Velious
expansion, and I was wondering what the consensus is on the usefullness of
the level 30 discipline.

I do plan on buying Velious eventually, but other than the Disciplines I
really don't see the reason to purchase it quite yet (not to mention that I
haven't seen a copy recently in my local area).

Regards,
Matt K
