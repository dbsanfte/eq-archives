The only reason for cultural smithing is to make cultural smithed armor.
Before you say "yeah no shit", think about it - are you going to want
culturally smithed gear for THAT character, or another one you have? Are you
planning to make money off it? If it's the latter you're going to have to
find a race in which there is a demand for culturally smithed armor and a
lack of GM smiths. Troll Warrior comes to mind (snicker).

And then there's the fact that getting to that level of smithing is going to
be the single most formidable task you ever accomplish in everquest. It will
cost you thousands upon thousands of platinums, hours of
carpal-tunnel-syndrome-inducing clicking, and either hours and days of time
gathering materials or thousands more plats buying up things like armor
padding and tools and such.

And you thought your epic was a bitch :)
