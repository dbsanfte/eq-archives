I am guessing you are talking about eq2?

Not sure if it can happen in eq2, but in eq1, it was possible to get a 
window off the screen.  Off hand, I am not sure exactly where that 
information is stored, but it should be possible to edit the UI xml files 
to move the window.  You could also try deleting the UI files, and having 
them reloaded by the patcher.  I have not played around with any of this in 
eq2 at all, so I cannot offer any specifics.
