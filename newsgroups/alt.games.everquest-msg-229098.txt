Since no one else is answering this, I did get a chance to play around
with this last night.

1) If the bag is lore, the token returned is also lore
2) You can have multiple tokens of non-lore bags
3) The tokens do not stack (at all)

ps. The bag exchange may only work on WR bags (per the
NPC's text, but I didn't test it)
