That would depend on who they are listening to.

If they were listening to some right wing
Christian fundamentalist, who can't bear the
thought of having his daughter knowing what a dick
looks like, they would get the scariest statistics
that he could find; the truth, as always, the
servant of that particular doctrine, rather than
its master.

If they read what was printed here, it might be
different;
http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/health/publications/condoms.htm

"...The condom alone, if used consistently (every
time), and correctly and is estimated to be about
97% effective in preventing pregnancy."

>  How many know that they are only 90% effective
>against HIV?

This is straight from Rush Limbaugh isn't it?

Except he said the statistic was 80%.

Here is what FAIR told him;
http://www.fair.org/press-releases/limbaugh-debates-reality.html

"A one in five AIDS risk for condom users? Not
true, according to Dr. Joseph Kelaghan, who
evaluates contraceptives for the National
Institutes of Health. "There is substantive
evidence that condoms prevent transmission if used
consistently and properly," he said. He pointed to
a nearly two-year study of couples in which one
partner was HIV-positive. Among the 123 couples
who used condoms regularly, there wasn't a single
new infection (AP, 8/29/93)."

The rebuttal works just as well for your
statistic.

>  I didn't until I was told so by a navy Hospital Corpsman in
>boot camp. 

Really?.. Well I guess that settles it doesn't it?

A "navy Hospital Corpsman" from "boot camp" told
you this... between heart transplants, no doubt.

You have to wonder why anyone would conduct
clinical trials at all, when this anonymous
medical genius is available. 

> When I was in high school, I was told that the condom would
>protect me.

Were you? I doubt it.

If so, you were misinformed. No responsible
person, not even the manufacturers of condoms
would say that they are 100% effective, and only a
very naive person could believe otherwise. 

Abstinence is the only method to protect 100%,
although, according to some people, this method
can be risky, even to a Virgin.

>  How many students know they're taking a 10% risk of being
>infected if they're sleeping with an infected person?

What will students do when they find out you are
telling them lies?

You are suggesting that one in ten of them will
die, if they fuck with an infected person. 

That is a lie.

Again, from FAIR;
"....In fact, studies have shown that when a
person with HIV uses condoms consistently during
sex with an uninfected partner, long-term
transmission rates are relatively low -- generally
2 percent or less"
