It's not "greed" when a seller holds out for the best offer. 

Either buyer could have made a final "take it or leave it offer". I
have done this countless times when I have had to compete with other
buyers for the same item. It is the buyers responsibility to know what
they are willing to pay for an item. The buyers chose to spend/waste
time haggling and cross bidding. Both took a chance and one lost.

The guy was a moron for expecting her to wait while he logged off and
"took his wife to work". Should she have risked a sure sale to buyer_2
on the chance that buyer_1 would be back as promised?

The only thing that buyer_1 lost was time. He still has his tradable
items, and he can still get a BoTH when another hits the market. Maybe
next time he will make a solid offer, and not take a chance.
