Oh no ... I'm right there within spell range. When the target dies,
the charm is usually between %10-%25 .. i invis, it comes after me
sometimes, root it, then dot it. I'm like 30 feet from it the whole
time. But three times now i'm certain it was down to like %15 health,
I look away, look back and it's at %45 lol
