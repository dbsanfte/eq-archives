Ah, the continuing decline of the player economy on all servers as they
age, as more people get to uberlevels, and more and more "hot" gear gets
into circulation.  Yep. I've seen that myself in action, and I've not
even been playing a full year yet. However, for the lower level folks
like me, that can sometimes be a *good* thing. :-)
  My more experienced brethren tell me of a time when you couldn't find
a Lammy for sale *EVER*, or if you did, it was some astronomical cost.
I'm seriously aching to get one myself now, and on our server they've
started popping up for as little as 5K PP. I suppose the same applies to
all the good stuff. FBSS is another that comes to mind.
