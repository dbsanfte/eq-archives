That's because some mobs are just immune.  Emperor Crush,
Ambassador D'Vinn, A Royal Guard, and Lord Darish all STILL
see through level 60 rogues' sneak/hide...and Emperor Crush
still aggros (as do bixie drones...but at least they don't see through
sneak/hide).

You took one mob's peculiarities (and some are just like that)
and let it sour you on one of the best parts of being a rogue.
Not only that, but there are some (very few) mobs that see
through Invisibility spells but not sneak/hide (Drolvargs come
to mind).  Also, some caster mobs will buff themselves and their
friends with a See Invisible spell.  It's only fair, and no different
than PC's in EQ's PvP worlds (where see invis is more useful
than enduring breath).
