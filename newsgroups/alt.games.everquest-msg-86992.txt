Well, after months of being stalled (or shelved) the guildies started
twinking my bard for some reason... and I re-discovered how much fun
he is to play!

Ok, still wearing a whole bunch of lambent at 34, but the weapons I
have at my disposal... oy vey, it is embarassing!  2 Centi longswords,
the Symphonic Saber and a Sionachie's Partisan piercer.  Piercing was
never used, but up to 85 now just from solo'ing and pumping all them
unused skill points.  And with th saber and Partisan equipped my CHA
goes straight up.  Sure, I've read here that's not supposed to affect
anything, but I NEVER get resists on charming, so call me goofy, but
I'm a believer in CHA.  :-)

Ok, enough rambling - the question.  Usually when solo'ing blues, I
simply go toe-to-toe with 1 (or 2 *ahem* I'm a bard...) and tend to
twist: 
Jonathan's Whistling Warsong (self-only 6AC, 23% haste, 22STR) 
Largo's Melodic Binding (AoE Mob slow and and AC reducer)
Denon's Disruptive Discord (AoE DoT - AC reducer)

Although I've found several resources that tell me that Denon's will
do at least +26 damage with instrument, I have no clue as to what it
does sung.  First question: Is it useful or am I better off with
Brusco's Bellow (18 dmg) or Fufil's Curtailing Chant (DoT and lower
MR)?  Again though, I have no clue what Fufil's does for damage
sung...

Of course, every now and then I still fear kite or charm kite (Marus
Seru is VERY underutilized on Rodcet Nife!) but with my twinked
weapons I actually can cut 'em down quick enough not to worry too
much...

So, to summarize:
Sung damage for Denon's or Fufil's?
Better ideas for solo twists?

For reference, when grouped I usually swap out Jon's Warsong for
Anthem (of course) and whatever else seems necessary - Charm song
usually and maybe Canta of Soothing. Oh, and the snare song is usually
up if no snarers in the group.  Always a crowd pleaser, that one.
