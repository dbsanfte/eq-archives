Druids (and all other priest casters) can't do their own research.  You 
have to find an arcane (INT) caster with high research skill.

That said, there is no priest spell that is research-only.  They can all be 
dropped/looted.  No idea if it's easier to loot the drop-only ones or to 
get the research stuff.
