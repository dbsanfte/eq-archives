I have spent almost as many hours offline looking thru the web sites
devoted to this game as much as I played on-line.  The basis of my
point is that for all that if the first 1/5 of the game is this bad do
I really have to spend another 4/5 of the same before it gets better
(avg time to get that far another 6mos+).  I don't have the time or
the energy to devote to just one game that isn't really entertaining.
I get more out of playing an hr. of Medal of honor then I did out of
almost 1 month of this.  My system is a 1.4 Pent. 512m with and
GeForce 3 64m with Broadband cable hookup.  I always ping under 100
online with all other games.  Most of my friends coudn't believe that
I even tried this game because of the pay for play aspect.  I did give
it a try, and it wasn't all bad; it just wasn't worth putting more
effort into then I already did.  I will pick up EQ 2 and I will have
high hopes that it will be what EQ wasn't.  The only reason I did give
EQ a chance was that I could buy the complete game for $50.  I really
hope that people who are buying by the piece don't feel as I do.  If a
company is going to charge a monthly fee,  there shoouldn't be a added
charge for addon modules.  Put another way I would not have given this
game a chance at initial $40 for EQ, and 4 x $35 for the addons along
with the monthly fee.  Then to put in at least 6 mos+ to get to where
the game is really interesting, give me a break....  I am trying to be
objective and not be bias.  I realise that this is a fan newsgroup,
even so deep down some of you must feel the same way.
