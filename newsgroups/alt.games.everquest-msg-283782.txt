Is it just me, or do others get annoyed when non-clerics in the group want 
to "help" and step all over you?

Let me explain.

Last night in an Ldon, there was a druid in my group. Seemed like a nice 
enough fellow, but he seemed to think he was the healer.

I have a hot button: "Incoming complete heal..." that I use. It never 
failed... each time I used it, my spell was JUST ABOUT to go off, when Mr. 
Helpful Druid would throw on a heal, and bring the health up to 80 - 90%... 
basically WASTING my cast, and draining my precious mana. I was getting very 
annoyed.

I feel that someone who continually gets nervous that a member's HP is 
getting too low and steps in to heal like this when they are NOT the healer, 
is insulting the "real" healer as if they do not trust them to do their job.

Can't druids fight? Geez... I've seen several that sit back and just do 
their minor heals and just give out buffs. We needed a fighter in this case 
(we had one warrior, a necro, a shaman, the druid, and me, the cleric). So 
basically it ended up being 4 casters and one tank. It ended badly. :(
