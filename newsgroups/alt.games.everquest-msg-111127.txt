There are many different things it could mean.  It could mean "I'm twinked,
so have better equipment than the other players here, so pick me!".  That
would be childish and rude.

It could also mean "I'm experienced!  I've played to high level, and
understand the roles of all the classes in a group, so won't do anything
stupid".  That would be useful information.
