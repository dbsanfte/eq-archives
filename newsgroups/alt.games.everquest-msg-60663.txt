Hi Toxic:

Many, many thanks for your in-depth answer, it certainly sheds some light on
a subject I've been longing to know about for rather a long time. I'm not
fortunate enough to own a Staff of Temperate Flux, and as it's a no drop
item (I think) I'll see about getting the quest done so I can put your
advice to the test. I think I will hold off until I'm level 51 as you
suggest, and I'm happy to let you know that I've just dinged 46, so
hopefully 50 isn't too far away, then it's just a matter of grinding out 50
'til the magical 51 is mine. My Int now stands at 194 and as I just about
have enough to purchase GEB's that'll raise my Int to 203 so I can then
concentrate on building up my MR rather than Int. However, the Robe I have
is Crystalline and I've seem to have owned that for forever and day, it's
not very attractive either, so I'm keen to upgrade, so may opt for a robe
rather than boots, still, GEB's are kinda nice.

Shame we don't play on the same server, it would have been nice to have met
you in-game so to speak.

Good luck to you, safe hunting, and I will certainly be in touch with you
letting you know how things went.

Kind regards ...

Stevie.
