This isn't quite right.  What wrong with asking a level 60 crafter to
make you some banded armor?  We're already assuming guildies who only
charge you cost anyway.

I'm still a fan of: *you* gather all the materials for what you want
crafted.  You can find someone else to press the combine button, but
you must gather the ingredients.  If it requires drops, you have to
kill for them.  If it can be bought in stores, you find the plat to buy
it.  That seems fairest and gives non-crafters the same requirements as
crafters.  Then you take your chances on the highest skill crafter you
can find. :)
