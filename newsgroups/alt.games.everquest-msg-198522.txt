No, you're the only one who *doesn't* see the problem.  That guild will
*also* have a group (or so) of *60s* who *can* pass the Trials.   That
group (or so) of *60s* will soom be 65.   That group (or so) of *65s*
can't group for XP with the rest of the guild.   And so on.

Pre-PoP, that wasn't an issue.   Those 60s could *happily* co-exist in a
guild
with a bunch of 52s (and higher).  Now they can't, since the level limit has
been
raised AND the XP range for those players has been reduced.    See the
problem
yet?   Pre-PoP, happy campers;  post-PoP (and post trials, where the path
for
62+ really picks up), unhappy campers.

Now tie that in with the *fact* that those same 60s can't drag a 58 through
the
trial and, even if they could, that 58 would just get splattered in the Tier
2
zones.   Again, pre-PoP (and pre-trials), the difference between 60 and 58
was reasonable.   Post-PoP (and post-trials), the difference between 65 and
58 is a *LOT* bigger.

Seeing the problem yet?   It's the *new* difference between 60+ and the
50s.

And that is why you're being seen as clueless.   A 52 in a casual guild
*could* go
to the vast majority of zones in the game pre-PoP, with the exception of the
"uber
zones" (NToV, VT, ST, VP, etc.) which are *raid* zones.   There wasn't an
*XP*
camp in the game my cleric couldn't hold pre-PoP at 52, for example.
Post-PoP,
there are *XP* zones those players can't get to.   It's new and different
and without
precedent in the game.   The only precedent was key quests for places like
Seb and
HS, both of which are trivial if you have a few 60s to help out.   A few 60s
can
"flag" a whole guild for Seb and HS in a couple of days.   That's not the
same thing
with the Trials.

So that 52 we were talking about suddenly went from "We can do epics, we can
go pretty much everywhere we want, we rule (without being uber assholes, of
course)" to being told "You can't get into these *XP* zones because you're
too
low-level" by members of his guild.  See the problem now?
