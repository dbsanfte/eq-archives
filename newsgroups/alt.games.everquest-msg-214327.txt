Yeah, I can confirm that it is a system font thing.  My chat window
tends to put everything in italics, which tends to truncate the tops
of tall characters (I can't tell the difference between 't', 'f', 'l',
or 'i').  Interestingly enough, the EULA is the same way.

So anyways, you might have to check/re-install the fonts on your
system to get it right.  Don't have a list of the actual fonts EQ uses
though.
