Well, there is a difference between using the card as an ATM and using
it to act as a credit card to make payments -- If a ATM card has a
Visa logo on it, you can use it as if it were a credit card. When you
go to the grocery store, you can either enter your PIN to use it as an
ATM card or hit the credit button to use it as a Visa card. The latter
is subject to a delay in the availability of funds, plus it doesn't
immediately deduct from your bank balance. (I got bit by that one back
when the concept of "Visa check cards" was new...)
