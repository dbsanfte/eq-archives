I don't mind having the text dark blue for mobs when I con them, I know if it's 
dark blue what it means. For my tracking list, however, the dark blue can be 
difficult to read. Is there any way in the new UI to change that color? I've 
changed the color references to other things that were dark blue, but I have a 
feeling the color of mobs when you con them is not changeable. Any ideas?
