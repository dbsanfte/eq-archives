I can't prove this (obviously), but "back in the day" it sure seemed
to me as if mobs that were normal speed (i.e. same as PCs) ran a tad
faster when chasing you and a tad slower when fleeing.  For example,
a black bear in EC would get an occasional swipe at your backside as
you fled (until you learned about jumping and strafing), and yet if
you later attacked a green con bear (so it fled at over 30% health)
you would get an occasional swipe at its backside.

I vaguely recall a thread here some time back on this same subject.
So they must have changed it back when they were busy making the
game newb-friendly.  It's not really a big deal, with all the other
changes the removal of such a minor bit of survival arcana seems
rather unimportant.  Old EQ is long dead, we should probably just
let it rest in peace.
