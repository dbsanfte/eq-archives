Hello all.
Can anyone recommend a *good* news client?
I use Outlard Excess but I'd like to hear the group's opinions of other
software.
The only other one I've heard of is Agent.

Functionality I'd like...a killfile and a permanent record of all posts.  OE
seems to delete them after a certain time, even though (I thought) I
configured it to not delete messages.

TIA

Brian (a.k.a. Tzen)
