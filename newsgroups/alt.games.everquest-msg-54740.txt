This one is far from 'off the road'. It's the basic levelling dungeon
for every Iksar from 10 - 20 (more or less). But since even all the Iksar
are not clobbering it up too much, I always get something to hunt
there. BTW: Loio is far from bad ... if you avoid the common Windmill
Sarnak Fort groups. Loio is VAST space and has LOTS of soloing possibilities
where you can more or less be alone. And if soemthing happens, there are
others to help you. Just avoid the main spots.
