Though I do enjoy the EQ2 content in a.g.e., I still find it a little thin 
at this point. As such, I have been getting most of my information from the 
SoE forums, and you know how *they* can be - although these are admittedly 
a bit more tame than some other official MMORPG forums, SoE titles 
included, have been.

I was wondering if anyone had any links to other EQ2 web sites or forums 
that they find useful. Naturally, there is Allakhazam and EQTraders. 

Any other good links?
