It does look pretty interesting.  Seems worth watching, although for some
reason, I'm not that interested in games with a science fiction theme (e.g.,
I'm not planning to try out SWG).  I'm not sure why this is, especially
since almost all my fiction reading is SF, with a sprinkling of fantasy
(LotR, Fafhrd & The Grey Mouser) and mystery (Sherlock Holmes).  My favorite
SF is from the "hard SF" authors--Niven, Asimov, Heinlein, so maybe that has
something to do with it.
