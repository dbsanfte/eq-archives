Given the results of the testing I summarized in my "Beetmi: ..."
post, I do not expect ever to see clear evidence of a softcap at
some specific value of your displayed AC.  There could easily be
a cap or "softcap" on either or both of your hit avoidance and
damage mitigation and without extensive testing to determine
exactly what affects either you can't very well know what portion
of a high level character's displayed AC can be attributed to
which.  I have encountered no controlled and repeatable tests of
the specific combat effect of AC Buffs, for example.  Also it is
entirely possible that the "AC" for non-armor slots and/or some
portion of the AC for magic armor (or non-magic armor for that
matter) applies to hit avoidance rather than damage mitigation.

/sigh  All this testing is doubtless far too tedious to ever be
performed (we do _play_ the game after all).  Still there are
a couple things I'd check if I weren't limited to a single account.
Testing game mechanics is hardly sufficient justification to buy
another computer and get another account tho, heh.
