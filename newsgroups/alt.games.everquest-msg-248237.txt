When I used to do this, the most common group was:

Enchanter
Enchanter
Cleric (me)
Wizard
Wizard
Wizard

The enchanters would lay down interlocking stuns, so that there was
little chance of any given mob resisting all the stuns coming at him;
essentially a stunned mob would be hit by four more stuns before his
original stun wore off.

I'd spot heal the puller, and spot or group heal the enchanters,
keeping everyone alive until the announcement came "start Nuking".

Then I'd blow thru mana on my own PBAOE line (not crappy, but slow
casting and very slow to pop back up), perhaps interspersing a group
heal in the mix.  Rarely would I get close to the bottom of my mana
pool before everything died.

We would substitute other classes for that 3rd wizard, two wizards
worth of AOE nuking was usually enough to kill everything anyway, so
although wizards with their insta click nuke do make excellent
pullers, any other class could give it a try, one of my favorites was
bard (largely because they helped cut the down time between runs to a
minimum) but I saw warriors, monks, rogues do it, and I'd bet just
about any class could, what you mostly need is large brass ones and a
way to annoy the bad guys but not get caught by them.

We -did- do some runs with a single enchanter, one chanter can
technically keep all mobs in total lock down, with each mob getting
hit by two stuns before the first one wore off.  But lag events, or a
mob getting lucky and doig the triple resist, then beating the chanter
to interrupt him... well, lets just say there were noticably more
disasters in a single chanter group.  If you're doing it for the exp,
then more wipes per play session doesn't translate to your advantage.

I never considered casting my own stun line.  The targetted AE does
hit the cleric, but its possible to ramp up resists to where thats
very rarely a problem.  But I don't think it hits more than 4 or 5
mobs... and there are much easier ways to kill 4 or 5 mobs than using
a PBAOE group.  The key to stunning in a PBAOE group is to hit -all-
the mobs, and keep them -all- stunned, -all- the time.  I guess its
possible that dropping a stun on three or four of the mobs every now
and then might get lucky and hit one of the mobs that happens to get
the magic resist lineup... but since there may well be 70 mobs out
there and any one might get lucky at any time, thats about 1 in 35 I'd
be helping.

Healing the chanter(s) who are keeping the lockdown going seems more
likely to help.

With two chanters who are used to working the game together, the
clerical healing isn't really all that important.  Cleric as puller
wouldn't be a bad plan.  There's a reason the cleric is along, and its
not really healing... its rezzing.  See, when you are depending on
things going right on 70 different mobs for a period of several
minutes, and then doing it again and again, well, inevitably things
will go wrong sometimes.  Thats when the cleric comes in handy, rez
everyone so exp loss and travel time loss are minimized, off you go
again.  Making so much exp that the occaisional loss of 6% of a normal
death goes unnoticed.
