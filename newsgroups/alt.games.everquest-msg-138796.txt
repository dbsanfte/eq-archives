I am trying out Dwarf Rogue on PVP server.  I now have few bags full of
rusty weapons I like to sharpen.  But I am having difficulty finding the
sharpening stone in Kaladim.  Where can I get one?  I went to Gfay a few
times and got killed by a maniac who just waits for newbie to show up at the
bank or at the lifts to kill.  There are bodies all over the place!  I asked
/ooc where is the stone?  And I got the reply "I have one do you want it?"
"No thanks" was my reply.  PVP server does make one very cautious of other
players.  It is a strange place; some people are quite good to me, but few
just look at you as potential meat for dinner.  It is very difficult tell
them a part, like in real life!
