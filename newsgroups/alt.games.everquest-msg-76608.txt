Yes will be interesting to see if other PC Zone subscribers get the main 
servers or the trial ones. I definitely am on the main one as have been 
playing with some established chars ;) Not that i'm complaining mind.

With regard to previous comments re the availability. Other than Luciln 
the distributor (Ubisoft) is not shipping EQ. This is from the horses 
mouth (Ubisoft)  as well as the major retailers in the UK.

Gameplay
Game
EB
Software first
Amazon

They are shipping Luciln but it is running low again in pretty much all 
of the above.

There comment was that EQ Platinum was shipping on the 31/3, I would 
guess this will contain all add on packs, may be a pure guess. But would 
seem like a good move to hold buying till this comes out and live with 
the PC Zone version.

Out of interest if I do subsequently install the trilogy will it realise 
that the files on my PC are newer than on the CD and not overwrite them, 
if they overwrite them presumably I will be in store for a huge patch?
