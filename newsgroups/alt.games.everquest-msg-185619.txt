Exsqueeze me?, A baking powder?

First, I have NOT lived a life shielded from anything. I know US history
well enough thank you very much.
The word "Neger" is swedish (and german also for that matter) for negro and
not nigger.
IE. meaning a black person, no negative connotation at all.

All that politically correct stuff about calling people african americans
because they are dark is just silly in my opinion.
What would you call a Danish negro? african danish?

Actually, come to think of it, the most common useage of the word nigger is
among BLACK people.


And nowhere in my reply did I say that the name should be kept did I?
In fact since it is part of a copyrighted songtitle it breaks another naming
convention rule anyhow.
