I didn't make it to 65, but my Wizard got to 61 with no significant grouping,
and no significant camping of things that were rare or with long spawn times
(other than the Ancient Cyclops for my jboots), so could have just as easily
done it casually.  Furthermore, there were still plenty of soloable mobs when
I quit at 61 that would have taken me to 65.

My /played time was comparable to that of people that grouped.

If he thinks grouping is a necessary part of advancement in EQ, he is out of
touch with how many classes actually work.
