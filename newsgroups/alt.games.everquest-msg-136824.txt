Some people are named quite well actually. I set my vendor up in a nice
quiet spot well away from the banks and of course when I awoke in the
morning there was some *huge* bear formed shaman vednor completely engulfing
me, and when I turned around their was this aptly named dark elf vendor
*sitting* directly behind me with his head up my butt.

His name?
