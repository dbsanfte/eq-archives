Assuming you aren't twinking with a regen BP, & etc...
Paladin solos reasonably well, tho you will have serious trouble with
casters, especially the self-healers.  At 30 you have 3 stuns (with
the two new ones added by Luclin) which would allow you to defeat many
blue casters, but at the expense of emptying your mana bar each fight
(i.e. more downtime).  As you move thru your 30s and blue mobs keep
getting tougher you have to be more and more careful what and where you
fight until you reach 39 and get Divine Purpose (self-regen buff) which
eases things a bit.  At this point Root becomes your best friend,
allowing you to root a melee mob and back off and sit down, recovering
HP and mana.  FM Giants are wonderfully vulnerable to Root, staying
stuck for the full 48 second duration over 80% of the time.  At 40,
with below average gear (average being skewed by the twinks, of course)
I could solo a Hill Giant, but it was a long and painful process, not
worth the effort.  By 45 you should have a Deepwater Helm, which gives
you a zero mana heal (Daring ac/hp buff) that will recover a little over
100hp with a ten-second casting time, needless to say Root remains near
and dear to your heart.  At 50 soloing is getting to be very slow for
xp, as solid blue mobs (those that always con blue) in the zones I am
familiar with are generally able to kick the hell out of my inadequately
armored ass to the point where it is much like soloing an HG at 40:
long and brutal and not really worth the effort.

Monks appear to solo reasonably well, possibly best of all a melees, but
I have no personal experience there.

SKs are apparently able to solo, I've seen them out doing it from time

to time, especially Iksar and Troll, but again I have no personal
experience.

Rangers can solo, and I have seen post-50 Rangers soloing, but their
weakness as tanks has a substantial effect on tactics and I have not
played a Ranger past 17 so I don't feel I am qualified to comment on
how it goes for them later.

Soloing a Warrior past 30 seems to quickly become an excercise in
frustration and boredom (I have solo'd successfully with a Warrior as
high as 32).

Rogues don't appear to have much ability to solo past about 20 or so.

Good luck, and don't forget to group from time to time, it helps

keep things interesting and can be a good way to get a feel for

the mobs you might be soloing tomorrow.
