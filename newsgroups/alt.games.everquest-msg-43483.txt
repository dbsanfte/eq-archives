Don't play a druid just because your friends want to have convenient
teleport. If you *want* to play one, that is an entirely different matter.

Speaking as someone whose main character is a lvl 52 druid...   I love
playing Mey; but there are a few things I wish I had known when I created
her. I think it's probably true that it's harder to find a group post-50 as
a druid than it is as most other classes. Pick up groups simply don't want
you. There are too many druids out there to begin with and quite a few of
them have little experience in groups which makes many players *very* leery
of grouping with a druid they don't know. There also seems to be a sort of
generalized resentment of druids as a class which appears to spring, at
least in part, from jealously over the ability to port and sow (and
annoyance with every druid who has ever said, "I'm sorry; but I cannot take
you to Emerald Jungle right now.") Complete strangers (to say nothing of
your friends and guildies) will badger you to cross the world to buff or
transport them, and a fair number (of the strangers, anyway) will become
downright abusive if you refuse. And while it is true that your friends are
happy to have you group and raid with them, you can't help but know based
on things they've said at other times that they'd really *rather* have a
cleric (if they need a healer) or a wizzy (if they need a porter/nuker).
While they're rounding up for that raid, you will *never* hear them say,
"Hey, we don't need a cleric, we have a druid." Instead, it's "Get the
cleric, get the chanter!" It's nothing personal, just that the high level
game is very specialized and those classes are perceived as being more
useful at high levels.  /shrug  There is, however, a certain amount of
psychological discomfort that comes with the suspicion that grouping with
you is kind of the EQ equivalent of a mercy f**k for your friends or guild
mates post 50. ;p

On the positive side, grouping is overrated. Groups get you killed; solo
you rarely die. /grin  You will be able to solo like a monster even at high
levels (not many classes can say that /grin). Your bank account will be fat
and happy. You will never have to sit about idle whilst looking for a
group. And you can always make a very nice twink that is one of the more in
demand for grouping classes.

In short, it's up to you. Play whatever class appeals to you. In the end,
they all have advantages and drawbacks.
