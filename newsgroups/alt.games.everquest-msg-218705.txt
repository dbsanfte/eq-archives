This happens only when a person is out of range of the kill who's
done damage to the mob.  Since the two bards in question aren't
"soloing together" anywhere near each other, there's little
danger of this happening most of the time.  If one bard does come
over to help out, then he'll be in range for any kills he does
help on, so still no problem.

If its an emergency, to Brell with the exp anyway, just getting
out alive is all you need (not that bards often have trouble with
the better part of Valor)
