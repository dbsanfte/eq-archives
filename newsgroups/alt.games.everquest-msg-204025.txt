This particular camp was not bad in that regard, to be honest.  However, 6
months ago when my husband put in his first 24-hour stint, it was bad.  
He had 6 different people sitting around him with varying degrees of "just
sitting here for timer" to "this is an FFA camp".  That's partly why he
gave up then.  

This time, and yes, after 48 straight hours of camping (the rollback did
reset the timer) Stormy spawned, we had a druid standing right there, who
even accidentally got aggro, and she just backed away and didn't try to
get involved.  So it was a LOT better than planned.

Was sorta funny..>I was holding camp while husband got a few hours of
rest. He'd just laid down 15 minutes before, and storm
spawns. "Rak! RAK! BIRD BIRD BIRD!!"

Now that I have the timer, wish me luck getting the mask for MYSELF.  
*groan* I figure I'm already a nervous wreck...might as well keep going
and be DONE with this spot, rather than come back in a month when I won't
know the timer.
