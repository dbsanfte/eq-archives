Boooo, that's not what I wanted to hear - though it makes sense :)

Boooo, that's not... etc.

I could give crystal caverns a whirl, though I do like the outside area
for Selos and swarm kiting, swarm kiting in dungeons with no selos =
quick suicide <g>

I guess I'll have to grind through the giants/cougers and just save up.
Toes and heads eh? People actually pay for that stuff? I guess I won't
have to be so liberal with my Destroy button... crud.

Thx for the advice.
