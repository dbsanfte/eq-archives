Bad idea. Most people doing LDoN aren't going to care enough to put up
with the hassles of that kind of a loot system. ... especially in LDoN
where time is often important. In about 100 LDoN runs (all lvl 65),
I've never seen a group that didn't do master looting or even had
someone suggest that it be handled a different way. I've also never
seen anyone run off with the loot in a situation that didn't include a
server crash and there isn't much to bitch about in that situation. If
you're that worried about loosing loot, just ML yourself.  If you run
across anyone looting all the augments (not a big deal at 65 where
they tend to rot anyway) then kick 'em out of your group immediately
and finish up without them. If a ML runs off with the loot, just don't
group with him again and figure that it was a (relatively) cheap way
to find a person you never want to group with again.
