Ship5
=====

Loot = gems up to Blue Diamonds, around 5-10pp per mob, those nice
high level spell research drops and the odd Rust Encrusted Wristguard
and similar, plus the blood and racial meat

XP = pretty fantastic, the mobs are round lvl 50-54, plus higher for
the Captains obviously.

I'd have to repeat that our single mid-50 group got repulsed from boat
5 due to a stream of adds which we ended up having to fear away into
the zone. With crowd control you might be OK, but the key is rampant
DPS and healing. I'd say that a group of Slower, Crowd, Cleric, Tank,
Tank, Hybrid would be fantastic. Having Stun-capable tanks would also
help, but the sheer damage chucked out by some warriors/SKs is not to
be ignored. These mobs hit for up to 150 a time, fight like hamsters
on speed and have fairly high hps.
