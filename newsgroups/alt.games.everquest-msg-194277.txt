Is this where you go buy an item from one guy and hand it in the other, 
then follow him to a hallway where wave after wave of mobs spawn with some 
rest periods in between?

If so, we did this once for about an hour.  2 Resist items dropped, but 
that's it.

How long do you have to wait before a nice item drops?  We were doing it 
for a guy who has a bard and a rogue and he said there was a specific item 
he was looking for.

Does it ever end by itself or do you just end it when you are finished?  I 
had to leave before it was "over", so I'm not sure how it was terminated.
