Yah, but look at the trade off.  Sure, a clinging darkness neck is nice, 
but that v.s Discipe Symbol of Brell Serilis?  I mean, come on!  Easy 
choice there.  BRING ON THE BEER!

Yeap, all of that.  If you're soloing for exp, it's charm soloing, not 
pet.  And I suck at it, and it's risky and dangerous, and chanter root 
sucks foetid goat testes compared to druid root.  Sure, theoretically, 
chanters can be awesome soloers.  But it isn't easy.  I vastly prefer 
bringing a druid along.  Especially since she's a sweetie. :)
