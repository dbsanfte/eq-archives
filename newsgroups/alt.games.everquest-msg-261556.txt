Yup, get used to it. ... some dungeons seem to be really bad for magic
resistant mobs (Tak springs to mind) and that applies at all levels.

You have the Mal-x line but until you get Malo at 60th level, that can
also be resisted. It's almost 0 agro though so at least you won't pull
a mob off of a tank when you cast it. I think mal-x is more useful for
soloing than grouping at that level though. 

If you need to get a mob slowed, I'd try to slow first, cast mal-x if
the inintial slow is resisted while you wait for the casting time on
slow to refresh, then cast slow again. If the mob resisted all that
it's probably almost dead by now anyway.

Meleeing probably isn't worth a helluva lot in that situation. If it's
a single pull the mobs will die too fast for you to make any
appreciable difference, if it's a bigger pull you're better off making
sure all the adds are slowed and root parked.

It probably was, at that level some groups just seem to tear through
LDoN, others have major problems.
