Sure they can...doesn't take much to learn the class.  There's a lot to
learn but a LONG time in which to learn it.

As for your traveling companion, he said it was his first character...he
didn't say he played it from level 1. :)

As to MY bard...he's my twink...my very first and still most beloved.
Created him in 6/99 and is still level 28.  My main chars are a 60 enc, 53
dru, 51 wiz.  My druid was my main for the longest time and the first
twinker...got him a set of lambent (via questing) by level 16 I think.  Now,
thanks to the bazaar, at level 28 he's got a few pieces of Singing Steel.
It clashes horribly but I'm working on fixing that...slowly. :p

It's fun to play Dress Up sometimes. <g>

As to my bardic ability...well, I suck.  Really rusty.  BUT, since my main
is a 60 enchanter and they have a LOT in common (or can have, depending how
you play), when/if I DO ever get around to playing him seriously, the
re-learning curve should be pretty small.  Right now I'm working on an even
older char (a mage) to get to 46 (currently 42 and lfg) so I can take him up
to Hate and loot some of that stuff that keeps rotting. :p
