Er... maybe you were in a different HoH to me.

The pathing is DIABOLICAL.  Think akheva when Luclin first came out.

And we got our asses handed to us last night by a bunch of mobs flurrying
for almost 800, so yes they do flurry.  Im sure some mobs rampage too.

Low hp/ac?  Shrug it didnt seem a noticable difference to me.  Resists were
so/so, I got the odd resist on turgers here and there, a guildie druid was
whining that moonfire only landed for 200odd damage last night though.

The exp is good, but then so is PoV when its empty.  I think all of PoP is
like this though, it just loses its magic when any old person is in there
