Funny thing, in HOT I generally take my resist gear off and put on
my exp grind gear... max mana and HP.  The only spells I"m
casting are heals, and they aren't Line of Sight.  The AOE off
the mobs -is- LOS.  So by judicious use of walls, I rarely
take any damage at all.  Why HP gear then, you ask?  Because
my main source of mana is Mod Rod 2!  Each charge off
one of those hits for 300 damage, and I want to be able to
eat as many as possible before CHealing myself... and in combat,
I want to be able to eat several charges without risking Low
HP Aggro.
