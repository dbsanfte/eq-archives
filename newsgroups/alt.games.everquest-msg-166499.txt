I was playing around in KC with my little 48 bard when, surprise
surprise, we got trained in RCY and the chanter died from running
the wrong way.  Well, I ran my cleric over and rezed her, when
the most astonishing train showed up at the zone line.  Lots of
mobs, I and everyone else waded in to the fray and sorted it all
out... but among the mess was Venril Sathir's Remains.  Nicely
indifferent.

No sign of the original owner, although I can't imagine how you
accidentally pull VSR to zone.

Well, after a while, we found a druid who needed VSR and had the
handin stuff on her, so we threw together a group out of what was
standing around.  I put Virtue on the highest level tank... would
have liked to have done BOA on the group, but they wanted to go
go go, and I was already down to 60M, so what the heck.

Someone attacks the remains.  Several more people pitch in, while
we are all shouting stop, zone, stop.  Everyone clears out except
for one paladin.  I'm sending him tells to stop attack while I
atone... but no, he stays at it till he dies, without having
damaged VSR visibly at all.

OK, well now the druid hands in items, and the ghost shows up.
Again, people attack.  Crys of stop, zone, atoning, so forth...
finally we get it calmed back down, another causualty among the
helpful but apparantly deaf cluster of people hanging out there
at the zone line.

Druid hands in spell, real target pops, and we start in hacking
away.  Wrong tank has aggro... and of course without even BOA
she's gone pretty quick.  On right tank, we are doing fairly
nicely, I've got SE on the MA and have slapped in a couple CHeals
but plenty of mana left.  Several more people manage to steal
aggro and die instantly, but there's not much can be done about
that.  Suddenly, MA dies... VSR double procced his 1500 lifetap,
and at 4300 buffed, well, MA wasn't at over 3000hp at that
particular instant.

VSR eats a couple of the horde and then latches onto grouped 53
paladin.  I SE paladin and then cast Virtue, while the paladin
uses a LOH to limp thru.  Back to SE/CHeal till I run utterly
OOM.  I use donals BP by which point I have mana for yet another
cast CHeal... and the mob dies just before the paladin is about
to.

Ten people, half of them under 50, half of them dead before the
mob is down to 50%... and we pulled it off anyway.

Now I know VSR can be killed by three people with good levels,
equipment, and a plan... but to throw together a spur of the
moment pickup group and kill him on the fly like that... well all
I can do is quote Mel Blanc "Its good to be the king...", as I
can recall wiping to him with a four group raid of my old guild's
best, back in the day.
