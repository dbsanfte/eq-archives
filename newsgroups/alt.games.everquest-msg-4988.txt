Buy the RUINS OF KUNARK...

Its the $9  (classic) one plus a BUNCH more stuff... like other lands to
explore and  an extra race you can be...
If you like - try the $9 one and see if you want to spend the $30 for the
extra stuff later - all costs the same monthly - and you canupgrade at
anytime just by buying the $30 one...

the $19 one (velious) ads even more lands and the like - good to see once
you have played for awhile..
