Yet another hapless victim to bard ignorance.

For those of you who don't know much about bards, here are a couple of
interesting facts :)

1) Bards are not tanks, we just wear plate armor to keep from dying all the
time, see #2
2) Bard songs create the highest taunt in the game.  Take a level 40 bard
for example.  During a regular fight, he can haste the entire group 20%
(thats like giving everyone an FBSS), add ~20 agility, ~20 strength (these
are not exact figures), 12AC, slow the mob, snare the mob, and regen the
entire group ~15hps every tick, all at the SAME TIME. If he plays
instruments during battle, he can sing clarity as well, and boost all the
effects even more. Then after the fight, he can continue to regen the
group's health, while singing two clarity songs at the same time.  Bard
clarity outdoes enchanter clarity, but it also stacks with it.
3) Bards are not pullers.  Pulling gives you an extra bit of aggro which the
bard can only lose by not singing at all when he gets back, which defeats
the purpose of having a bard.
4) Bards cannot converse during battle, because they're hitting keys nonstop
to switch songs.  I'm good to squeak out the word "ok" as a reply on
groupchat during battle.
5) Bards can run much faster than sow, charm, fear, regen, clarity, snare,
haste, sing enduring breath, zing stamina, locate corpses, increase every
stat including int and wis, DOT, harmony, increase every resist better than
other classes, mez, identify items, nullify the need for food and water,
invis, see invis, debuff, dispell, levitate, rune, and melee! Now that's a
full plate :)
