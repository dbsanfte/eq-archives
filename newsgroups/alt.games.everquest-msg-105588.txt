Only one Centi Longsword? Oh, and you forgot an uber haste item. Tsk Tsk -
nOOb.

*grins*

On the positive side, what is wrong with the above scenario? If someone can
save the 80K plat to equip his alt nicely then kudos to them. It is not
something I will ever be able to do, even if I put the Chimp to work farming
Rathe Mt or OOT full time.

And for someone who put's in the hard yards and gets no twinking at all -
they are not ripped off either. Necessity is the mother of invention, a
"Hard Yarder" will have a much better tactical understanding of the abilites
and shortcomings of their class, and will be better <players> as opposed to
characters.

Then again, I am hardly a MUD designer guru....
