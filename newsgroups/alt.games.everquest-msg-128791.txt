Isreal occupies -nothing-.  It's all part of the nation of Isreal.  They can
occupy Palestine no more than the English can occupy Liverpool.  If you want
to draw lines of occupation, then we can talk about the Arab occupied areas
in Isreal.  And as for your deaths from "oppression," killing enemy
combantants is not oppression, it's de-facto warfare/ police work.  It's
unfortunate that Isreal can't separate those two actions, but understandable
when the Palestinian combatants won't separate themselves from the civilians
(and the civilians won't separate themselves from the combatants).

And you will remain ignorant.  The past sets the stage for the present.
You're suggesting you can slug someone and say "hey, it's in the past, let
it go."  Isreal did that, and the other cheek got hit, as well.
