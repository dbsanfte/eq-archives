Groupmates can turn bard songs against the bard...

Last night, I got a tell from a bardish friend that I would not
believe what had just happened. He was in a group in Dreadlands,
Gorenaire was out and showed up near KC. My friend is considered
kindly by her and decides to go up and say hello. Someone else in the
40ish group jokes that they should pull Gorenaire. Next thing my
friend knows, a druid in his group - with bard song on him - runs up
and hits Gorenaire.
My friend respawns in Thurgadin in time to hear the druid say "I
thought you wanted me to pull her".

(Dr00ds should stay the heck away from my friends)
