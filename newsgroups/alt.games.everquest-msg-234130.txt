Last night I got in on an "open" pickup raid for Behemoth. (Yes, yes, 
yes, I already know, "pickup raids r teh suxxorz, kk?" but when you're 
not in a raiding guild and want all your flags, you try what you have to 
try.)

As I'm sure you can guess from the fact I'm writing this post, we got 
roasted like a kentucky chicken. But the expeience taught me some things 
and left me with even more questions. Looking for some input from 
somebody with more experience on this beast.

First, the gnome. Numerous people were yelling "Don't hail the gnome 
twice!"  Why and how does this work? I hailed him, but in all the spam I 
didn't notice any particular flag message or anything like that, so I 
was't even sure if my hail had gotten the job done. What happens if you 
hail him twice? And if you have hailed him once but failed on behe, do 
you have to hail him again next time? How do you know if you've messed 
up and hailed him twice?

Next, resists. From the days back when I used to raid, I have a mediocre 
set of resist gear, and with that stuff and my self buffs, I can get all 
my resists up around 150. We had raid buffs, but no bards that I could 
see. (None in my group, for sure.) I thought the resists looked pretty 
good, but I got nailed by the AoE apparently every time and was dead 
after getting off only one nuke. What do you need for resists on this 
guy to avoid that gravity flux and whatever all else he's dishing out? 
Are bards a must have?

Behe's AOE's aren't line of sight? *boggle*. I was out in the hallway 
around a corner when I got hit with the first gravity flux. Should our 
raid leader have kept all the skirts out at some greater distance until 
the MA had established aggro? (He never did last night. Gave the call to 
engage too soon, I guess, and behemoth was all over the raid force.)

We had seventy freaking people with an averag level of 61.  I thought it 
was going to be a zerg overkill and was really shocked when we wiped 
with Behe at 19%.

I like to be knowledgable about any raid I'm going on. I'll be doing a 
search today myself, but if you know of any good online resources with 
strats about this raid, I'd love to read up on it.

Thanks.
