I think this means "If you don't agree with me, don't post.  My usenet."

Agreed.  I have cable modem, and do go LD.  Happened just yesterday as I was farming
eggs in Lavastorm.  Scary!  I didn't die, but wouldn't have been surprised if I had.

Why should they be able to tell this?  And do you think that your is the only
petition that they have lined up?  I dunno, but I think that were I a GM or guide, I
would ignore the "I went LD and died, now come rez me!"  petition too.

You don't know much.  GMs are paid.  Not much, I'd wager, but they are paid.

Get thee to Stormhammer. 

   This whole post reminds me of the attitude of held by the guy who introduced me to
EQ, Shawn.  Shawn is much more into EQ than me, and I'm pretty into it.  He would
throw a temper tantrum when the cable modem would dump him, and fumed about "Getting
his money back" on patch days.  They day they announced the price increase, he called
me.  I picked up the phone saying "hello", he shouted "Did you hear what Verant is
doing?!?  Those bastards!  How could they!  We should..um...."  He seemed baffled
when I told him that Albertsons had raised the price of barbeque sauce too, let's go
storm the store!  Shawn started up a shaman specifically to do alchemy, then was
horrified when he found out around level 25 that it was capped by level.  He was all
set to bitch at the GM's in game, write and email the company, and then get some sort
of grass-roots petition together to correct this obvious injustice.  
   The fact is, this is their world.  You don't like it, feel free to find or build a
better one.
