Followed by tanking them. I can also quad root kite similar to a wizard,
but that takes too farking long.

Well gee, then I would probably cross that off my list of things to solo.
What is your point?

Not from my experience.

Increasingly unreliable in raid situations against very high level mobs.
This is not the same thing as "near the end game". Shamans can tank (and
solo) juggs, a definite end-game mob. Solo warrior vs Jugg = CR, regardless
of their superiority in AC/HP/Defensive skills. No, shamans cannot tank
cazic thule v2.5, or Dozekar, or Kerafym, or the Dain, or frozen jesus, or
ones like that.

Nobody has ever claimed otherwise.
