I have a fairly young necro (just dinged 11 yesterday).  I
am finding that I am able to shine in pretty much any
situation.  Solo, Duo, group.  I even kept a level 25 guy
alive that pulled a mino lord.  Almost killed myself in the
process but with Dark Empathy, I kept feeding him health.  I
think he was a ranger, he was rooting the lord, and pinging
it with arrows mostly, I feed him health when his root
broke.  I was rather proud of myself at being able to keep
him alive.  He was rather greatful as well.
