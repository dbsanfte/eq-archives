I just dropped the surname on my main, just /petition to have it done.  My
advice is kiss a little ass if you want it done fast, I had to do it twice:

/petition Hi I'd like to have my surname changed, if you have the time.
Thanks!

No respnose

Next day....
/petition Hi I realize you are very busy and have much more improtant
business to attend to, but if you happen to have a spare moment I would
greatly appreciate it if you could drop my surname for me.  Thanks in
advance for your time!

Response time was about 5 minutes.
