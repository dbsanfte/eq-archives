From what you stated above and the rest of your post, the problem has
something to do with your modem. What kind of modem is it? Is it a
Hardware modem or a winModem? WinModem's rely on the CPU to function,
and can cause problems in some games. 

Also your modem may be attempting to share hardware resources with
another device such as the video or sound card. (such as an IRQ)
