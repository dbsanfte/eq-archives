That is precisely the reason those changes were made on sullen. Don't
think that will make it better for you than a regular server, it
won't. They cut the xp loss in half because on sullon its legal to
train you or disable you when you are fighting an NPC so the npc kills
you. So its cut in half because you will lose it more. Those changes
are so people can tolerate playing on it at all.

Actually it is more so, since you are ALWAYS out to get people on the
other teams. Its the entire point of playing there.

You are mixed up, trivial loot code is on the firiona vie server.

EQ is and always will be a player vs enviornment game no matter what
they do to it. It is really stacked against you already and throwing
in PVP just makes it worse. If you find the regular servers totally
boring and easy as hell then the added challenge might be for you. If
you have not yet got to level 50 in great gear very easily on the
regular server, than the pvp ones will be far worse for you. XP
changes on Sullon won't change that.
