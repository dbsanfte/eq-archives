I am a mage, and of course i usually have a pet with me.  How to make my pet
assist in attacking in battles with other group members. ?

I was grouped this weekend and when we were attacked by multiple mobs... i
didn't know which one to attack after our enchanter mezzed one of them.
( the mobs were standing right beside each other )   I had the wait until
our puller and tanks took out one of them...and then when there was one mob
left, send my pet to help out and nuke also.

How to make pet assist the puller i guess is my question.

Thanks in advance.

ps.- i tried /assist ( grp member name )  pet just sat there....didn't do
anything..
