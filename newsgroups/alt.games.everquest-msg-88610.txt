Okay, what gives?

Ever since I got the latest mini-patch (the one
with the new eqgfx_dx8.dll), I no longer get
the "spell bar" (the purple one that "counts down"
how long until the spell fires), nor any spellcasting
sound, whenever I fling a spell from one of my
armor pieces.

This is *very* annoying, it's hard to tell if I
even cast at all, nor can I easily judge when I'm
about ready to cast another spell or buff.

Is anyone else having this problem?
