finally done with patching, still waiting for SOL to arrive at the store on
the 7th.
Logged in last night first time after patch. Joined a group at the fort in
FM, casted pet spell. The pet looks unreal,  everyone in group was wow-ing
and arrr-ing.
Pulled a Gaint, sent pet in, but.......  but the pet was just standing
there.  During the 30seconds fights, the pet taunted twice and hitted the
mob twice, WTF.
Group memebers being to question me, asking if the pet was attacking?
humm.....
Any other necro having this problem?
Did Verant nerf the pet after patch? no animation for pet?

just want to know.
