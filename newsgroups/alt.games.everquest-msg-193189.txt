try  Wizard/Magician
     Necromancer/Druid
     Enchanter/Ranger
     Shaman/Monk
     Cleric/Warrior

ive been doing cleric/rogue for 42 levels and it works
well so far but the rogue is really twinked.

Also try a group of Magician
                    Necromancer
                    Beastlord
                    Shaman
                    Enchanter
                    Shadowknight

or try   Magician
         Necromancer
         Beastlord
         Magician
         Necromancer
         Beastlord

Lol....ive tried both of those pet groups and we were killing so fast
we barely had time to cast on the mobs before they died.
