I don't think there's enough reviews and opinions of EQ2!!!  :-) 

So here's mine.... 

I've tried to give EQ2 a fair try before passing any judgement or
comparing it my all time favorites EQ1 and CoH. It's been about 3
weeks of playing daily and at level 21 I feel qualified to compare it,
at least for the low level gameplay. This post is more for EQ1 players
who are wondering if they should make the big cross-over. These are my
just opinions, pls resist your urges to flame and knitpick over
details. I'm still playing, and will be for months, but as a 6 year
EQ1 addict I am disappointed because:

1) EQ2 is extremely "controlling" and think most EQ1 players will be
disappointed/annoyed when they realize experience the lengths Sony has
gone to to "control" you and how you fight. Things like: not being
able to help ungrouped other players, not being able to rez ungrouped
people, not being able to buff people, not being able to properly run
from a fight, not being able to kite, not being able to solo
-efficiently- after 12+, etc. I've waited a few weeks so I could try
to understand the logic of "locking" npc's, but I still see none; This
whole system of "locking" an npc just blows.  There is no advantage
over the EQ1 or WoW system. The end result is that combat in EQ2
"feels" more like an arcade game that has less real-life logic,
whereas EQ1 has more of a realistic feel, like virtual reality.

2) The guild xp and xp decay system is incredibly moronic. Again this
is something I waited to fully experience before commenting on (and
you should do the same - see how you feel after completing two dozen
writs). I now lead a guild of 50 active members and we are approaching
level 5.  In EQ2 you must level up your guild before your tag shows
publically. Leveling up your guild involves killing grey cons
ENDLESSLY. This gives you no XP, no challenge, and NO FUN. I'm
insulted that at level 21 sony forces me to run around the newbie
zones doing newbie quests like kill 10 young kodiaks.  I estimate it
takes about 100-200 of these quests/writs to get your guild to level
5. So you must convince 12 people in your guild to become "patrons"
(suckers) and help you run these dumbass boring quests over and over
again endlessly, simply to level up your guild so your tag shows like
in EQ1 (there other other minor benefits, but who cares, at low lev
you just want your tag to show). But it doesnt end there... and this
is where Sony's evil side really shows: If you stop doing these quests
daily your guild starts to loose it's XP. Guild decay. Basically I see
this as the ultimate hamster-in-the-wheel scenario. Sony has suckered
you and your friends into grinding grey cons endlessly for no reward.
And you must continue to do this simply to avoid punishment. Spare me
the RP crap about helping your city. Let's face it: if your a patron
your Sony's ultimate sucker.

3) EQ2 feels is incredibly small compared to EQ1. It even feels small
compared to CoH. This is another way they are "controlling" you and
making sure there is nothing original about you, or how you fight, or
WHERE. IE if you start at Qeynos your first month or more of real time
playing will all be spent within 2-3 zones from Qeynos or Freeport.
You cannot run off and explore the world -to the extent you could in
EQ1-. There is no such thing as running off to explore an unpopulated
zone and find something that nobody else kills. Your essentially
locked in with the rest of the newbie zombie-hoards, and there is no
escape.  From 15-25 you're spending 95% of your time in two or three
zones, there is very little variety. In EQ1 you could get a port or
hop on a boat and have access to a whole new area. This is sadly
lacking in EQ2.
