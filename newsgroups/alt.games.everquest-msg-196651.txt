Keep plugging away.  Words of Detachment is going to be the hard one to get.
It's very rare.  I was lucky enough to get one and have our guild's level 60
necro combine it for me.  If you *do* get the words needed, I honestly
wouldn't try to combine them yourself.  Detachment is just too hard to get.
Other than that....group, group, group until level 29.  It will be hard, but
once you are there you will forget the pain in the ass time you had without
the proper pet spell.  I was lucky enough to get my words, but by level 29 I
had enough words to do the 29 pet spells several times.

Good luck,
Sean...
