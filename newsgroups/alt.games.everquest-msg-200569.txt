Last time I checked EQ was a multi-player game.  For those few (like
you apparently) who cannot grasp obvious implications, this means that
most anything that affects your gameplay is likely to affect the
gameplay of others.  In the specific case of KEI and the group-buff
exploit it has resulted in Enchanters being unable to get groups (we
already have KEI, who needs an Enchanter), players expecting others
to have KEI and refusing to group them if they don't, casters who
don't have the first clue how to play their class effectively even
though they've grouped since low level, casters who cannot be bothered
to group since solo xp is much faster than group xp (especially once
you factor in time lost to organizing a group), & etc.  KEI has fucked
the su-50 game thoroughly, and it's long past time they fixed it.
