 Thanks !!

Went ahead and got Evolution so that I didn't have to D/L all the patches. I
did read of a new expansion Dungeons of Norrath, but they didn't have it.
That's K, I'll need the time to get reaquainted with EQ anyway.

 As far as FA, I tried it for 3 months. It was just as boring as when I left
it.

 No insults this time, even bashing self proclaimed Gods get's old after a
while. I am sure people like CryingFreeman, Lokari, and of course DarkTyger
will send plenty my way.

I need the laughs :-)

Thanks again for the info.
