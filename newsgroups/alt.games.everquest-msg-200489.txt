No kidding.  I can remember people dinging L9 three times in one day
(Crushbone can be tough when you're tanking with a Ranger wearing cloth
and patchwork while wielding a tarnished long sword).  Not only do the
under-10's no longer lose xp or have to do corpse runs, but they don't
have to buy food and the pp value of the trash loot dropped in the
newbie zones has been increased enormously.  It's easy nowadays to have
a full suit of vendor Leather before you ding L8.  Hardly anybody does
the Bard mail quests anymore, they used to be by far the fastest way to
get a few pp together (for human/elf/dwarf/barb anyway).

OTOH, the KEI kiddies would be in heaven if they added a /livebuff
command that took you straight to 50, with suitable gear, spells,
and skills of course.
