There are several things:

1) The percussion "modifier" for the drum is higher on the better,
more expensive and/or rare drums.  A store bought drum has a modifier
of 1.8, which means that, for example, if the song Fufil's
Disenchanting Melody (?) does, say, 10 points of damage per tick
without a drum, it will do 18 points of damage per tick with the store
bought drum equipped. One drum in the game (War Drums of the Rathe)
has a modifier of 3.4, meaning it would do 34 points of damage per
tick in that same scenario.  Currently that's the highest drum in the
game.  And currently the highest possible modifier is 3.9 with some AA
points (without AA, it's 3.6)

2) The stats on the drum can give you various boosts to stamina,
strength, resists, etc.

3) There are "effects" on the drum, like being able to cast Enduring
Breath.

4) Some drums are equippable in a slot other than the Secondary slot
(with nothing in the primary).  Some can be equipped in primary, while
wielding a weapon or shield in the secondary.  One can be equipped in
the range slot, allowing you to wield two weapons!  And there are some
weapons with a percussion modifier, so they act like a drum without
having to wield a drum.

There maybe other things I haven't thought of, but those are the main
ones.
