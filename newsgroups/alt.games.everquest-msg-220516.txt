Why would anyone care about anything?

Because they do. Because its interesting. Because its fun, and sometimes
nice to know you can do it if it sounds like a fun thing to do.

If it makes you feel any better 'I regularly tank LDON groups which give
useful XP' or 'I regularly tank elemental XP groups which give Mad l33t0r
AAXP' or whatever. Shrug. I dont really care as much about that as the
fun of tanking big deadly dragons, and crazy flurry drakes though.

You might not care, but hey ;) Thats the wonder of usenet. Not everyone
gives a crap, but those who do can gossip away merrily with nothing but
the occasional cranky sod interrupting ;)
