I smoked 4-5 packs a day for 4 years. My lungs gurgled one morning
when I got up, so I quit. I had 3 cigarettes total in a period of 5
years afterwards. I was in the USNavy, and I was able to purchase
them at sea. Which means no taxes. Couldn't take all I bought

Yeah, like day time talk shows, or people who must watch their day
time soap operas. Or people who only watch one type of tv
programming, and appear to 'get the jitters' when that isn't
available.
