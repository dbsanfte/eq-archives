My Druid is now lvl 29. It this an appropriate level to head to EW to start
soloing for Ulthork Hide Armor or should I find a group to help me with
this? I have the BCP and would like to upgrade to the Ulthork Tunic to match
the sleeves I was given as a gift. Plus that, the increased wis and mana are
nice. )

Thank you,

Cloudanser 29th Druid Quellious
