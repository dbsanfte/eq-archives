Had some thing like that ages ago. Got a BIG train of orcs behind me
and some how I managed to train one Orc Centurion up the PoD lift (as
I hap no map and was a total noob back then I didn't know where I was
running to - until I saw the PoD - orc lift would have been closer, if
I knew that back then). He was still chasing me and since the Kelethin
guards up the city are as slow as they are down the city, I managed to
train him all the way up to the bank where a wiz 50+ nuked it for me.
I still have a screen cap somewhere of the death cent's corpse laying
infront of Kelethin Bank.
