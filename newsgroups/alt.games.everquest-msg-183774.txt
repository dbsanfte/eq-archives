    Yeah. That cleric is grouped with a necromancer that can solo an AA
every 20 minutes when he's having an off time with charm breaks. And from
the safety of zone-in you can get all the XP when grouped with someone
killing as far away as the Carprin area. So the necro is soloing like
normal, and the cleric is quietly gaining his share of the XP.

    I asked some of the necromancers in my guild about Faah, the main for
the Xev twink. Apparently he's at 450+ AA's. I guess when you have them all,
you have to find some new use for all the XP you can generate!
