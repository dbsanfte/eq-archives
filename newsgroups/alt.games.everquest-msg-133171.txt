Why would you feel sorry for us shaman?  We have the same damage to mana
ratio as Enchanters, 675 (at level 60) for 250 mana, cast every 7 seconds.
Level 54 spell, and the last nuke we get.

DoTs, well, yes, those are fun.  Really looking forward to my epic, and
being able to toss in that third DoT.
