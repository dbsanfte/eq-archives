   Before anyone blames this on lazy Test players, I'd like to say
that I have /bugged this at least once.  I think I got ingored,
though.

   For a very long time, years, one couldn't buy cooking items or
fletching supplies in Freeport.  This was before PoP or SoL.  Freeport
was actually a hub of activity in those days.  Now that it is a ghost
town, of course, it is fully stocked.  This was thought of as
annoying, yes, but hardly a bug.

   Surefall Glade, a starting city for human rangers (I think), has no
bank.  Would it hurt anything if every starting city had every good
and service available to it?  I don't think so.  But I would hazard to
guess that one of the original intentions of not doing it that way was
to encourage players to travel to other places to see more of the
content of the game.  Originally, if one wanted to do tradeskills, one
had to travel to at least a couple of other cities, the main being
Freeport.  If you "lived" in Freeport, you had to travel to do
fletching.  Of course this was when traveling meant getting a port,
hopping a boat, or running cross country.

  Since PoP none of that matters.  Go to the PoK, and you got
everything you need.
