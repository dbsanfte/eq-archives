Wow, congrats on 39 in one day. :)  Forty is a bitch.  Forty-five wasn't
that bad for either my druid or my enchanter (just dinged to 46
today...thank god).

That guy wasn't a druid, he was a dr00d.  A fucking lazy-assed guard killer.
You don't need buffs to kill guards...there's no risk involved.  Well,
that's not at all true, there's plenty of risk...BUT NOT TO THE DR00D, just
the lowlife n00bs (fuck 'em, right?).

I hate dr00ds.

You finally have a decent skin buff.  SLS was almost an insult...I don't
think I started using it until level 29 (level 24 spell) because it didn't
give much more than SLR.

Group port to Misty is nice.  It's come in handy many times.

Share Wolf Form is a crowd pleaser...just TRY to wander around Kelethin for
more than 5 minutes un-anon without someone asking you for it. :)  Comes in
damned handy in Unrest if you're doing quests, though.

Nothing else that exciting, but some decent upgrades.
