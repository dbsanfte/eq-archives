    Yes, you can. You have Turgur, and that's pretty much the one spell that
gets you groups. I have seen a shaman solo the zone-in mobs when they're
melee frogs, but in general you'll have to be grouped to be doing squat.
Also be aware that in some camps you'll have resists on slow that are pretty
high, due to your level. You'll soon learn the names of the frogs and how
that translates to level. Stay on the upper level (if the group wants to
jump down into any chasms, decline), and try to avoid any areas with Krup
frogs at first while you get a feel for the place. Camps that would work for
you include Disco one, zoneout, Nec Guard (sometimes called B3 for the three
beetle spawns there), Nec Jail (sometimes called Gangrenous Beetle), and
Arm/Bar. After about a level or so there you'll know exactly how well you
can land spells, and can use your judgement. In terms of shaman-specific
loot, JB Arms drop in Nec Guard, JB Helm drops in Nec Jail, and the vaunted
JBB drops in Crypt.
