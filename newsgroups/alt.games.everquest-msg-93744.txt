Really? Care to quote what scientific text says that surveys are even
close to an exact science? Surveying is like dipping your hand into a
bag of 50 white marbles and 50 blue and grabbing 10 marbles at random.
There's a chance you could come out with 8 or even 10 white marbles.
That doesn't mean the majority or all the marbles in the bag are
white, does it?

A random survey is just that: Random.
