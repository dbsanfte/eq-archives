**Yawn**
And yes I am gay, I am a happy person. Notice Maxie, I said I am gay, not
homosexual. Though I do know some homosexuals male and female who would kick
your little slime covered body.
And only little knee biting, wormsucking, puss licking maggots like you name
characters after literary characters, because of a lack of imagination and
or brain power to think of something orginal.
Max you are a little dweeb, you have no writing skills whatsoever, and your
flames are not enough to make a baby wince or cry.
You do not even get any points for attempting to flame. My four year old has
better comebacks than you.
I bet your mother still pays your bills and packs you a lunch. If you
actually do go to school, do you ride with the other kids or go to school on
the short bus?
Make sure you keep wearing your protective head gear and bite guard, we are
all witnessing the damage that has ensued from your last unprotected
seizure.
And everything you keep harping on gay, fat etc. I think you are a fat dumb
kid you has strong gay feelings.  Your dad bends over and you get a strange
feeling in your little dick.  I think you have a lot of hate in your little
soul, and you must also hate yourself.
By the way Maxie, your mother has had crabs so many times she walks
sideways. :-)
