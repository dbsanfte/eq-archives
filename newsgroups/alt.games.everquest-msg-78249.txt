I don't think level has anything to do with it.  Faction is what
matters to NPCs and you gain and lose the different factions by
killing things and doing quests.  You'll see a message each time
your faction changes.

You were lucky.  There are no standard trips and the highways and
byways are dangerous places.

Yes, you need backpacks or other containers.  One trick to use
until you can make enough money to buy a backpack or until you
find an NPC who drops one is to start a quest that involves
putting things into a box or bag.  Simply ignore the quest and
use the container to carry things.  Be careful not to use the
COMBINE button though.

You have assumed correctly.

There are guilds in almost all city zones.  You can go to any
guild for your class and train.

You can learn many skills, but it takes a lot of effort, time,
and money to become proficient.  A wise person specializes.
Getting started is easy, simply invest as many training points as
you feel you can afford and then buy a book.  (The books are not
always straightforward, but will get you going.)
