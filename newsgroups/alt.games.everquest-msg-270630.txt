You summed up a great deal of what I find frustrating about EverQuest 2, 
except for your issues with the quest system which I do find somewhat 
confusing. My mmorpg experience began with EQ1 and I have to say that I 
find EQ2's system to be vastly superior...the journal which keeps track 
of every quest is always fairly clear, and gone is the need to write 
down all the quests I'm doing on paper to keep track of them in detail.

Elsewhere, however, I do find the lack of variation between races, 
classes and plot progression for each character to be very 
disappointing, though it hasn't been enough to put me off playing 
EverQuest 2. We were told when the game was released, this is not EQ1, 
however I constantly feel that it should be. To me a sequal is a 
progression, taking the positive aspects of the predecessor and then 
improving them, and in some areas they have done this. They have taken 
the world and given it a facelift, taken the graphics and reworked them 
to take full advantage of modern computers. So why not take the 
diversity that EQ1 had (I remember my Froglok's dark, dank home in the 
middle of nowhere, and how different it felt to my Half-Elf's harmonious 
Surefall Glade home which lay so near to Qeynos) and improve on that 
while they were at it?

The diversity is what I miss...it was a defining feature of EQ1 to me, 
each race with it's own characteristics, traits, history, it's own home 
which could and sometimes was a day's (Real time) walk from the two main 
cities, and you got the diversity between races and classes from the 
very moment you enterred the game as a level 1 character. You didn't 
have to wait until you were in your teens to be different to every other 
person you met.

Like I said, all this rambling and it hasn't put me off EQ2 at all, 
however it hasn't helped make the game more enjoyable than City of 
Heroes for me, and hasn't stopped me yearning for the style of gameplay 
I have in EQ1. I go back to EQ1 to get that gameplay, but the zones are 
quiet and I just keep thinking "I want the graphically rich world and 
the busy zones back".
