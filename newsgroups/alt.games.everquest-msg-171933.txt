Hi,

I've been playing online games now for about 8 years and the rpg's in my
opinion are the best. When it comes time to choosing a character build
him/her according to what would you think would give you the most Fun for
your dollar. For many that means the most bang for your buck. Sounds like
you are already familar with the game sets. Tweak your character to where
you would like to have it say in 3-6 months. Six months is a long time to
take a single character.

Good Luck and Safe Travels,
Archait(48Wiz)
