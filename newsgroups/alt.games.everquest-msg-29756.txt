My Win2k plays EQ just fine.  But, if you are having problems and want to
get Win98 running just for EQ, this is a decent solution:

Buy a cheap 4-8gig drive and install Win98 on it.  Transfer your EQ to that
drive ( several ways to do this ).  Spend around $10 - $15 on a removable
IDE hard drive tray ( try to get one with a built-in fan).  Then, use your
Win2k for normal-everyday-use and when you want to play EQ, shut down the
machine, slide out the Win2k drive, slide in the WIn98 drive, and boot it
up.

Depending on your motherboard / BIOS, you may have to go into your BIOS and
tell it to redetect your HDD ( if it doesn't autodetect on boot ).

If you want to deal with the various problems that can crop up, you can try
dual-booting.  Some masochists will have Win2k, Win98, Linux, and OS-2 on
the same drive with no problems.  Others just want Win98 and Win2k and have
never-ending problems.  Using the 2nd HDD approach is easy, and only
requires a drive-swap ( easy with the HDD tray ) and a reboot.

If you don't have an extra 5-1/4" drive bay open, then the HDD tray can't
work.  Sorry.
