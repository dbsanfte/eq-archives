Subject: Any easy way to get to Cobalt Scar?

Had a friend tell me that a good place to get some exp would be killing
Ulthorks in the Eastern Wastes and that there was a good quest involving the
the tusks that they drop.  I went there yesterday and killed some and now have
4 tusks but found out that they have to be given to a chief in Cobalt Scar. 
I've never been there and from what I've seen on EQ Atlas it looks like it'll
be a giant pain in the ass to try and get there.  Is there a simple way to get
there?  Do anyone's ports go there?
