Actually, I'd have to pretty much agree with this.  Meemers
can tank lots of mobs that would eat a rogue for lunch, but
at the same time I'll bet his damage curve isn't really all
that small, either.   The only reason some raids need a
warrior for a main tank over a monk/sk/paladin is that special
discipline.

Rogues are pure damage.
Monks are great damage and great tanks.
Warriors are pure tanks.

That middle seems to be a pretty sweet spot ;-).

Of course, I can sense traps...
