The correct term is "recently acquired". But seriously, be up front about
things like that, don't try to hide it. People can make allowances if they
know you are short on experience and even help you with pointers, tactics

It's the inconsiderate clueless that get raids/groups wiped that give the
rest of us considerate clueless a bad name.
