I've never been as close the high-end game as you sound to be, but I've
been through the quitting.  And I came to the conclusion that leaving EQ
isn't as big a deal as many would have it be...you are neither a loser nor
one of the Ones Who Escaped the Evil Empire.  Though in all honesty, it
felt like a big deal to me at the time.  I experienced withdrawel and a
lot of confusion...all the signs of addiction, so I agree about the
addiction part of EQ.  I've always had a predisposition for being stuck in
fantasy worlds (books, D&D, daydreams, etc), so I don't blame EQ.  

And here I am preparing to return.  Why?  Because in the end it isn't a
big deal, so I just say "Why not?".  If it sucks, I'll just leave again.

The "great truth" I discovered out of this, in the end, is that time away
from EQ is often a very good thing. :)  Whether you stay gone, or not...if
the game is griefing you, just Go Away from it.  Eventually you'll figure
out what makes you happiest.

Though i will NEVER say to someone "it's just a game".  Except in the
broadest sense, in which case life itself is as much a game.  Or
rather...think of EQ as the Matrix inside the Matrix...except the
RL-Matrix requires your conscious attention, so just forgetting about it
for the EQ-matrix is kinda...unwise.

Whoa, tangent there, sorry.
