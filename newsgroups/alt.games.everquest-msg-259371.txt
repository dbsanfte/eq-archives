Give us a comparison, please, once you have enough info to give one.  I'm
curious.

I've played D2 hard core exclusively for more than 3 years and have
experienced only one death that I *might* attribute to lag.  There are
spikes, etc. on occasion, and at times I've had to bail out of a game
because of them, but you probably experience those with DSL, too, since
every time I've bothered to check, the problem has been somewhere on Bliz's
end.

IMO most "lag deaths" are synonyms for "I got my lame ass toasted and don't
want to admit it", as was mentioned above.  :-)
