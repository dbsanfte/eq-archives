Hi!  I have a question about the window displays in EQ.  As in when you hit
f10 and it goes into the transparent wide screen mode.  On one account, when
I go into inventory, it stays in this mode, and it opens up the inventory
with transparent windows and the big auto equip thing.  On another account,
when I go into inventory, the screen flashes back to the non transparent
original mode.  I was wondering what the option is to turn on this mode for
your inventory screen?
