--------------------------------

Class-specific sites are generally the best for spell info. For you in
particular, I would recommend checking out
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman - TONS of good stuff for Shammies old
and young. Other than that, http://www.allakhazam.com - look the spell up
and pay attention to the posts underneath from other Alla users - they
usually contain info that is not yet updated on the site.

By the way, Cannibalize II is sold in the Abysmal Sea (GoD zone) by a
Barbarian chap named Hatem for just under 12pp.

Hope this helps!
