WHY do people kill guards in newbie
areas??????????????????????????????????????

I yelled at a guy tonight and called him an asshole and a dickhead
because
he was fucking killing guards in a newbie area! If he wants to kill
guards,
fine, go somewhere that newbies and low lvls like me at 13 don't need
them!!!!! He said he was gonna report me, like I give a shit!

ARGGHHHHH. I HATE that.
Plenty of stuff ingame to kill, WHY do people do this??
