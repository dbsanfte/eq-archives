Runes, words, and pages drop randomly off of level appropriate
mobs all over the world.

If you are buying them from a vendor, its because someone has
sold them there, unless I'm -very- much mistaken.  Four purchases
is not enough to prove unlimited supply, you'd have to get over
20 of the things for the vendor before I'd start to believe that.

I save all pages, runes, and words to hand out to appropriate classes,
but I have to admit that I burn them in the reverse order if I run out
of loot space, that is to say I destroy words before runes and runes
before pages.  Frankly I'd rather have runes to give to wizzards as
goodwill gestures for ports or translocations (or just good faction
with a potential porter later) and Pages for clarity and more importantly
better happier enchanters that I might group with later.  Mages and
necros rarely do anything for me... good ones do make good group
mates, but all too often they are busy soloing.  Further, the fact
that I can't tell necro from mage words at a glance makes em even
more inconvenient to keep as tochkis... if I could I'd burn necro
words before mage, but as it stands its random choice.
