Difficulty 100 to make a tailored backpack.  I haven't tried to make one
yet, given that my Tailoring is a pitiful 32.  At present I am far better
off selling the pelts, in fact I've made about 40% of my money that way.  I
put an hour in every now and then collecting pelts in Everfrost Peaks --
those bear cubs got pretty flimsy at some point..
