Root parking with a rogue.

In groups without a chanter and the puller pulls an add or two it is common
to root the add(s) and move the first mob of a ways to be dispached.  The
important part here is "a ways".   The main assist or puller has to pull the
mob FAR ENOUGH away that the rogue can move into position behind the target
and backstab without getting beat on himself.   I have been seeing this
happen to many times and have developed my "Stand to the side just enough
but still see the back" technique about as far as I can.  GIVE THE ROGUE
SOME ROOM please.

A good puller or main assist will, after hearing "MOB_so and so is rooted"
move the original mob far enough away and... turn the mob so he is between
the mob and the rooted add.  I know that means he won't be able to see the
rooted one, but the rogue can do that.  This will allow the puller or MA to
get beat on if root should break instead of the weaker rogue.

If you see this happening in your groups, speak up.  Sometimes, us rogues
are too dumb to know better or say anything too.

Oh! one thing I hate to see worse the the above happening, is when the
rooting caster calls "rooted" and none or only some of the melee's move.
GET your ass moving get those mobs apart!
