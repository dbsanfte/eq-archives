The Bazaar has killed the professional trader's profits. Whereas you could
buy from the desperate to sell and then sell to the desperate to buy,
nowadays you can't. Sure you can find some amazing deals for items but as
you say, selling them on you will have a small profit margin. Is this a bad
thing...No, not really (and this is from someone who made a fair amount of
plat playing the EC game) My friend's just returned to the game so I thought
I'd help him in some equipment...crafted arms, legs, boots and bracer for
under 400pp took me...5mins, maybe.

The fact that people can just leave their characters there and eat, sleep,
go out or whatever means that you are never likely to *not* be able to find
what you are looking for in a  short period of time and nearly always at the
price you want.

I am surprised people still feel the need to spam in the zone...average zone
population in the evening is 450 (on bb) close to 300 are traders of which
I'd imagine 3/4's are not even looking at that screen. Further to that,
anyone wanting an item can search it and make their own mind up what is the
"cheapest deal" and doesn't really need anyone telling them. Although I did
find it funny when someone was offering cheapest prices in zone and would if
proven otherwise would better that price by 10%...Supermarket wars, here we
come :�)

Always check the prices of what you are selling, you don't neccessarily need
to beat all the others just put yourself in the ball park.
Try to stand right at the front of the trading area, if you are afk people
will always stand in front of you if they can, this didn't stop me buying
from people "buried" under other bodies (they had the item I wanted at the
best price) but you will lose out on casual browsers.

On a dial up here and have been logged on since 8am, you don't need
Broadband, just a 24/7 dial up with no timed disconnects :�) Tho' that is
about the only good thing I can say about it atm.

The Bazaar is such a great improvement, it takes frustration from buyers and
sellers, although it does lower the profits of the sellers...I can live with
that, If only so I no longer have to ask "How Much?" and get "Offer" as a
reply...That alone is worth a dozen emergency patches :�)

CF
ADSL, soon....<fingers crossed>
