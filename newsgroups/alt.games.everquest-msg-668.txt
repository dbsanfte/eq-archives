Try the Everfrost plains. It's full of giant spiders, snow leopards,
and snow orc troopers which will all be blue to you. Keep your eyes
peeled for orc mountaineers and shamans and ice bone skeletons which
are higher and will aggro. 

You may well be KOS with the Barbarians (check by /conning Arnis
McLish, a lvl 2 NPC who runs around by the Blackburrow entrance).
If so, use invis to get past the guards into the plains.

The Everfrost canyons (the lower level area) is crawling with
decaying skeletons, too, so you should never lack for bone chips.
Getting a map is highly recommended for this area.
