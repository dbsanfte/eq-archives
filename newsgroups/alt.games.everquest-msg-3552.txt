Hi @ all!

In regular view (full window) no problem, no lag.

As soon as I change into my spellbook or hit F10 (small window, options
menue), I get lag and will be disconnected. Its a big problem, because I
cant med, change spells or trade something!

Has someone had the same problems or can anyone give some advise???

Thanks and happy easter

Halladar (Inoruuk)
