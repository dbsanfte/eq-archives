Were you playing with a chanter? Your mezzes are not as good as his, and many bards seem to think they are.

I'm sure other classes have other reasons.

Whats wrong with that? I'd rather have a healsong and mana song while 
running away at a good clip... That way downtime is reduced and we have a 
better chance of surviving if an add pops in our faces.

From the druid POV, all party members should be sowed at all times. Period.
