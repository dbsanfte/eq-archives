I wouldn't think Necros would "stack" well together.
Mages can because they have their tanks (as do
Necros) but they kill with direct damage.  Any DD
spell stacks;  DoTs don't.   Having four necros in a
group means each one is limited to only part of
their abilities on any one mob.  I wouldn't think that
would be desirable at all...

(Two may be acceptable due to the different spell
lines;  I'd think four would just step on each others
toes too much.  If you're looking solely on the damage
the pets do, a rogue and monk with two necros is
going to go through mobs a LOT faster.  Well, at least
as long as Fear isn't resisted...)
