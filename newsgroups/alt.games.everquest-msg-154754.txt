I saw a bard level 49 or 50 doing the giant fort in burning woods.  Using
charm, the bard was knocking them down pretty fast.  There are three types
of giants there, the ancients, the verdants, and the arbors.  Some of the
arbors will be cyan, the rest dark blue.  There is also occasionally a
named, Gorul Packlock or something like that, who drops the Treeweave.
He'll be blue to you as well.  Has a lot of HP but isn't very resistant.
And if you decide to just run them around instead of doing the charm thing,
there is a lot of open space there as well.
