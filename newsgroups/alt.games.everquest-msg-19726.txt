I saw a shaman in burning woods last night in bear form, summoning a
pet. I joked about begging buffs from the pet and told him they made a
nice couple. He thanked me and told me his pet was unfortunately
smelly, and said he'd had fun summoning pet in blackburrow and
watching people beg off it. I recommended he take pet to Unrest :)
