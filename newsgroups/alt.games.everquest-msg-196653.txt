: I simply never found twisting that physically onerous.

It's good to get the input from an actual bard on this subject,
Sean.  Thanks for your input.

I'm actually pretty surprised to hear that bards prefer to keep
hitting keys to keep songs going.  I'm surprised to hear that
kind of repetition is actually enjoyable.

As a software engineer myself, who does a great deal of typing,
I can tell you that my experience programming and playing EverQuest
are quite different in terms of mousing and typing.  When
programming, I tend to type some, and think for a bit, and type
some more, and think for a bit.  I'm hitting lots of different
keys with both hands, instead of having one hand devoted to
pressing a certain few keys every 3 seconds or so.

In fact I find programming doesn't hurt my arms at all, but after
a session of EverQuest, I can find myself feeling some light
pain in my forearms.  It could be that EverQuest raises my
adrenelin and I'm mashing the keys too hard.

That's a good UI question.  Not having played a bard, I can
only guess at some answers.  My gut reaction would be to have
song gems stay pressed once pressed (assuming it makes sense
in the context of that song), and you'd hit that gem again to
raise it, and it'd stay raised.

For example, to twist "Lola's Lucious Lips", "Betty's
Bodacious Breasts", and "Amy's Awesome Ass", you press each
of those song gems.  They stay pressed and the songs keep
twisting.

To swap out "Betty's Bodacious Breasts" for "Tonya's
Tempting Thighs", you'd hit the song gem for "Betty's Bodacious
Breasts" (which turns it off) and then hit "Tonya's Tempting
Thighs" (to turn on that one).  The swap is done.

Unless I'm misunderstanding you.

: Of course, this was done to death on eqbards a long time ago.

What was the general consensus of the bards there?  For or
against a very keyboard-intensive process when twisting?

-Ed

P.S. Kaev, please see Sean's response which, even though it
disagrees with me in many areas, as pleasant, informative,
and friendly.  You should try it sometime, instead of just
being the ass right off the bat.
