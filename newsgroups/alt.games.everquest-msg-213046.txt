If you have a wizard port you in, it's directly south from where you
spawn. If you have a druid zone you in it's kinda south-west. If you
make the run from PoK through FV to DL, good luck, because you'll be
running across the entire zone, and even if you don't start a massive
train it takes about 6 or 7 minutes to run across with SoW and
Levitate.

However, if you want to find a pickup group there, always zone in from
FV, because they usually hang out around the ruins close to KC (a
castle somewhat centered in the eastern part of the level) which has
several ruins around it (they are numbered beginning north with 0 and
then counting clockwise, you will here people on shout saying things
like "Ruin 3 LFM".. just so you know. took a me a while to figure this
out). There are virtually _always_ pickup groups here, unfortunately
most of them are utter newbies.

There also used to be a couple "Greater Spurbone"s walking around on
top of and around that pyramid, but I think they got nerfed recently.
At least I havent' seen them in a long time. But don't say I didn't
warn ya.

Pretty accurate description, except i think that since the recent nerf
there, there are only 4 of them left in the pyramid: 3 on a 20 minute
respawn and 1 on a 30 minute respawn (i think, YMMV). But that should
be enough for you for a while.

I've found that you can actually sit safely on top of the litte
pyramid right in front of the one that has the skels in it. You can
even pull them as they walk by the entrance from there (they walk
around in a clockwise fashion inside the pyramid sometimes). Sitting
there also makes it somewhat obvious to others who may come to hunt
there that the camp is taken. Not many people come by there though.

Yep. there is also one other, slightly lower level skel to the south
east on top of a small pyramid. He's a place holder for "Brother...
something or other" which I think is part of a quest or even epic, and
he gives a weird faction hit, so best leave him alone, but go ahead
and kill the placeholder skels.

He's actually some quest NPC i think.. some musician wanting to hold a
concert or something. If he doesn't con aggressive to you, talk to
him. He's got a story to tell ;)

I think they got nerfed... haven't seen them in a long time. Well then
again I haven't really been hunting there since they nerfed that camp.

> and near that wanderer is a vendor.

Yep, I think he's an Iksar and has the basic necessities
(food,drink,bandages).

<SNIP>

I hung out for quite a few levels around here, all the way up to
around 49 i think. I enjoyed it a lot. Another thing about these
skells is, that since there are 4 now (when all are spawned) and since
you have a lot of safe space around there, it's a perfect place to
practice quad-kiteing. Enjoy!
