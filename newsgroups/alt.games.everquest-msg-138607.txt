You *would* think that, but according to the SWG Stratics site, a memo
got "leaked" out from the dev team (they released a picture of them in
their offices with the memo up on a monitor) with the numbers. Looks
like 100 external testers, 100 from Sony, and 50 from Lucasfilms and
other interested companies involved in the project.

Of course, for Beta 2 that number will likely go WAY up.
