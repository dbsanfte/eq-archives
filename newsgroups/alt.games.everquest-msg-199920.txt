But while grouping ,unless you have KEI, your legs will start to atrophy as
you'll be constantly sitting to meditate only getting up to heal or buff.
Every once and a while if the tank is doin' good and your at full mana you
can get up and get a few wacks in but be sure to /assist the tank so if you
need to break from the fight and drop back to heal you won't have the mob
bashing on you.Any way yes it is fun.
