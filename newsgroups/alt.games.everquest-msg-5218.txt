Again, you display an almost pathalogical inability to actually understand
what other people write. I'll try and explain in simplest possible terms,
because of course anything requiring a 1st grade reading level is so far
above you that by comparison, the andromeda galaxy is nearby...

Sergey thinks (correctly) that Sword is a trollish imbecile. Sergey does
not want to ever group with Sword. You somehow get the idea from the
sentence (helpfully quoted at the bottom) that Sergey is afraid of Sword.
You are wrong. You cannot comprehend simple english sentences. Sergey is
better at understanding written english, AND HE DOESN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
NATIVELY.

I post mentioning the fact that you completely misunderstood what Sergey
was writing. You follow this up with the belief that I cannot comprehend
what you write. Unfortunately this is the case, but not because you have
ideas that are beyond me, but your embarrassing lack of typing skills,
appalling grammar, and general dewdspeak attitude often renders what might
otherwise be a normal sentence incomprehensible.

>the fact that u or others dont keep up with me neither surprises nor saddens
>me

The fact that you cannot write an english sentence without lapsing into
dewdspeak saddens the entire human gene pool. Please don't breed.
