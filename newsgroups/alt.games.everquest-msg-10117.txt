For instance, I have only one spell for my SK that uses abjuration called
Endure Cold.  At 30, I get the much anticipated Feign Death spell that also
uses abjuration.  If I want to have a decent chance to have this spell go
off, I need to sit around and cast EC on myself or nearby PC's over and over
again.  Big waste of time.

I'm not saying there aren't ways to work a skill by mapping to a hot key or
as a 2nd cmd to an often used cmd... I'm just saying the system of
practicing a skill over and over, especially a skill not often used could
use some work.
