I agree with most of what you had to say, but, a cleric is far from 
integral to a good group, "standard" or otherwise.  I've been in many an 
excellent group with the standard, healer, slower, tanker, crowd control 
that have included no clerics, druids, warriors, or enchanters, with 
nonstop pulling, no stopping for medding.  Yes, this does include PoP 
groups, in a variety of zones, including BoT.
