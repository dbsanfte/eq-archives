Well... DUH! That's would be perfect.

However, we've already been through that. 

The very incident that spawned this thread, was a case of someone doing 
just -that- and he was told in no uncertain terms that killstealing 
didn't exist in coh, and that his feedback on the subject was 
disregarded.

Whats the point of leaving feedback if CS just ignores and deletes 
reports of killstealing because they've apparnetly been trained that it 
doesn't exist, and any customer who reports it must be imagining things.

My whole complaint from the beginning isn't that there is rampant 
killstealing in CoH that must be stopped NOW! (that is one of the 
strawman that xocyll would have you beleive).

My whole complaint is that CS should be taking reports of killstealing 
seriously and not disregarding them out of hand as something the player 
made up... because as everyone knows... "Killstealing cannot occur in 
CoH" (per a very narrow and useless definition that fails to reflect 
what the playerbase is complaining about.)
