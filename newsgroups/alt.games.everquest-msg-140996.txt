LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM

Str: +7 Wis: +7 Magic Resist: +7 HP: +75 Mana: +75
Weight: 0.8
Weapon Skill: Hand to Hand

Average reported price is 19.5k

The effect drains 75hp from the target to you.

Anybody paying 600k, or 360k, or even 72k for one of these seems like they
must be out of their minds.  Or have so much money that it really just
doesn't matter.
