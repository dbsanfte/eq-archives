Quite a clever post, indeed.  I entered into the Machiavellian gaming with
her just as she gamed with me.  She was manipulative, but it wasn't just a
one-sided scheme on her part.  I played my part.  I was simply sharing a
pitiful anecdote, venting, whatever you might call it, and maybe it will
make some out there a little wiser.  I certainly am wiser for it now.

There most certainly will not be any posting from me to the links you
supplied above.
