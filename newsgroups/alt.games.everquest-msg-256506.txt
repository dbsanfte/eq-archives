So you think BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is pronounced B A R T?  Wrong.

Oh, and guess what?  NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is
not pronounced N A S A.

Or for an example that is probably more familiar to you, the North American
Man-Boy Love Association is NAMBLA, not N A M B L A.

In EQ, there is the example of SOW (Spirit of Wolf), which is often
pronounced SOW, and often pronounced S O W.

Do you even think before posting?  It took 3 seconds to come up with these
obvious counterexamples.  Geesh.
