So what? Necro + Mage manapumping stacks and both are needed in some cases.
Mage DShields add a good whack of FR as well. Vital in some cases.

Like all INT casters Mages have seen their relative power dwindle as melees
have been powered up. Pet casters completely rules the preKunark days,
especially before the pets were nerfed to acceptable levels. The Mage Epic
pet is still an absolute monster, btw.

Every class finds themself filling a very narrow role on big raids (the only
time necros really have to pump, the only time Mages do their dull dull dull
job). The 'gods' of grouping have it pretty bad as well. Enchanters are a
buff class with occasional suicides thrown in. Clerics do little but burn
1000pp per hour in peridots. As a warrior I dont get to do any of the fun
stuff like pulling I just get to stand where Im told and press attack (MT is
more interesting but you pay the price of being unable to risk sneaking afk
_at all_ for the entire raid duration).

I reckon the pet casters got most nerfed over the history of EQ but they
needed it. Anyone who saw what these pets could do with the delay sploit,
when they were L49 mobs, cannot doubt this.
This thread should be entitled "which class attracts the biggest bunch of
whiners?". The debate would be just as lively, and there would be several
contenders for the title.
