Actually, as confusing as that zone is, the maps on eqatlas make it very, 
very easy to navigate IF you have your sense heading working.  The first 
couple times I explored KK I actually printed out the map, AND the 
pheerkitty guide, and mentally swam through it several times.  Since the 
only see invis mobs are Estrella and Phinny, you can safely get a bit lost 
and be ok.  I strongly recommend that if you're going to be doing any 
EXPing in KK, you print out the maps, and the guide, and explore it 
beforehand.
Oh, and it helps if you have a permanant EB item and an unfailing invis 
(i.e. be a bard).
