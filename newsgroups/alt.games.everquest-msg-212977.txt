Hmmm...Wizard's Flaming Sword pet is still 250 mana.  When they originally
lowered the mana cost on the Cleric pet, I seem to recall they did the same
to the Wizard pet a patch or two later.  I wonder if they will again lower
the Wizard version to match?

Not that I'll ever have that spell.  Is goes for around 7k on my server,
which is too much for a mostly-for-fun spell.
