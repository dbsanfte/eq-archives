No, there would be no excuse for it if an unintended and unexplored exploit 
or bug was either grossly inflating the economy or unfairly killing people. 
With a game(read: program) as massive as EQ, tweaking one thing can cause 
unexpected consequences in other places. *NOT* fixing them would be 
negligent- what they do is just due diligence.

This may be true(read: is IME true) of major revisions(read: expansions) of 
the EQ code. They have deadlines, etc, and the *.0.0 release of any massive 
program is usually teh suxxor.

I am just glad you don't run an apples-and-oranges produce farm.
