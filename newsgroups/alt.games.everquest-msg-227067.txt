Hard slaughters are sweet for experience and loot.  Can't ever seem to
convince enough people to give it a try though.  The reason I choose
slaughters is because you're gonna want to clean out the dungeon, and
sometimes collection doesn't always go as planned.  I've found that
most people want the critters as as easy as possible for speed
purposes, and thusly choose normal difficulty.

C'mon folks, who's up for a hard one?
