All NEWBIE cities.  Never underestimate the desire of the average
player to get as close as possible to his desired destination.  And
who can blame her?  With downtime spent medding & healing, why not cut
out travel time wherever possible.  Look at it this way..you have a
goody two shoes choir boy pally who wants to get to lavastorm.
Closest newbie city I reckon is Neriak.  Think he's gonna take that
port?  Not likely!  So that pally is still going to want a direct port
to LS.  Don't worry, taxi service will remain a gold mine.
