I made the same mistake when I started my Cleric.

If I knew then what I know now he would have an extra 17 wis, but with the
items I'm now picking up this makes little difference and it's kinda nice to
have 127 str, helps with all that coin I manage to loot while medding :P

From my experience, whatever is your "defining" stat will most likely hit
the cap of 255 anyway at some point, I actually know a druid in my guild
that worked out he has about 275 wis, so thats 20 he could have put
elsewhere at creation.
