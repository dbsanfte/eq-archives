For a separate account you need a new account key... They don't care much
about the disks, it's the key on the jewel case that's important... that can
be obtained by purchasing the software, or by one of the various free
offers.

You might want to wait a week or so before running out and making a
purchase, I JUST got an offer for a free 5 day trial of the EQ Trilogy from
Sony in my email about 10 min ago. (I'd send the key to you but I already
gave it to someone in the office who's been talking about wanting to play
but not wanting to drop a wad of cash on a game they wouldn't play for more
than a week.) I assume everyone will be getting them in the next few days
(though I could be wrong, been wrong before).

That will give you the first 3 expansions without having to drop any $$ on
it aside from the subscription past 5 days (or game card).

If he seems to enjoy it, you can pick up Luclin for around $15.00 I think.
He should have no need for PoP for a month or two, at least :).
