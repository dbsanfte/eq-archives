}48% use IE by choice was the last figure I saw (April 2004). With Gecko
}based browsers (Mozilla/Netscape/Firefox) having 33%.

I'll buy that... the last figures I saw would have been biased toward EQ 
players who read this newsgroup (based on logging on my website that I 
posted a link to here) and it was more like 90% IE.. So I figured 50-60% 
IE was a reasonable estimate for everyone.  48% is right in that ballpark.  
I retract my majority statement, and substitute plurality. :)
