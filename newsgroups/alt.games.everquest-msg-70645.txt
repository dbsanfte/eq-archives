Apparently with the SoL expansion there are now some different
abilities that classes get now; for example, wizards are supposed to
be able to score critical nukes now (like a warrior's critical hit).
Do you have to have the SoL expansion to be able to make use of these
new abilities, or do you still get them even if you don't have the
expansion?

Thanks in advance,
