Ugh.  So this is like WIS and Mana.  It depends on your level how they
equate to each other.  *sigh*  And I thought I'd get away from that sort of
thing when playing warrior.  Oh well.  What's the formula for figuring this
out?

What?  Hmmm.  OK, where's this written?  I'm getting conflicting information
here, folks.

Also IF 1 STA = 9 HP then if Combat Value of 1 AC = 15 HP then 1 AC should
not equal 5 Stamina but more like 2 (1.666 to be precise).
