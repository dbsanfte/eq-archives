However, one of the things people who study user interfaces have discovered
is that when a user wants to do something, and on the way to doing that, the
computer puts up a display with text and some buttons, most users just press
whatever button seems most likely to make the computer happy, without
reading the text.

The more text there is, the less likely the user will read it.

When something is in plain sight, but in a place were people are *known* to
usually not read it, I'm not sure that can be called conspicuous.

If they want to make sure that users actually read the thing, they should
put it on a quest NPC that you have to deal with to get past level 1. :-)

    You say, "Hail, Freeport Lawyer"

    Freeport Lawyer says, "Hail, adventurer.  I see you have enough
    experience for level 2, but haven't read the EULA yet.  Let's talk
    about [transfering accounts], and some other things"
