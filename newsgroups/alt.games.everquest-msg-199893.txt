Well, I do have a BWS, it just requires more tradeoffs.
Fortunately my RL buddy is a 65 ranger with EQ/AM2
(nearly 3) and our groups are well used to positioning
for LOS.

Also, I'm gunning for 64 and suspend minion 2 now that
I'm back from my break from my mage.  At that point I'll
be aggro limited on my DPS rather than mana limited
(for the most part).
