Bullcrap.

Any raid group capable of taking on Vox can get back out of Perma
*easily*. They don't need to be ported out, they can walk to the zone.
Hell, I've done the grind *in* to the buff hall with one druid, one
warrior, and one cleric, handling every mob on the way. It's the exact
same mobs on the way back out, plus there's a nice safe zone to run
through at the end.

Anyone who can't cope with that has no business being on a Vox raid.

Sounds to me like you don't think anyone should have to do the crawl
out, simply because it's a minor inconvenience. You're sure willing to
sacrifice the druids convenience at whim, though.
