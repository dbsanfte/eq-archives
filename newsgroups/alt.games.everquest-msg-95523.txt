We had a guild crawl in Ssra Temple last night, and we were getting spell 
dropping every couple kills.  We got our group regen for the shammys, and 
all of our mages now have the uber-modrods, and it seems that quite a few 
other casters were getting spells too.  I didn't see any bard songs drop, 
but I know that our casters were pretty damn excited.
