>- better textures (probably worth it for me).
The difference is noticable but not extreme

>- horses? (can't afford anyways)
If you want to see them you need Luclin, but that is up to you.

>- more spells? (I'm a MAG)
You can scribe and use the Luclin spells without the expansion. You
will have to buy them from someone who has Luclin if they are not
available in the old world.

>- new character models?
I REALLY like the new models, but that is just my opinion. 

>- new race/class (maybe later, for now I'd like to stick with my
>current HIE/MAG
If you are not in a rush to buy Luclin, you can always wait till it is
on a good sale.

One thing you forgot to consider is the Nexus. Since your mage is not
a teleporting class you might want to consider Luclin for the benefit
of travelling between continents through the Nexus.
