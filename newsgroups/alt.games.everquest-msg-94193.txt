Exactly. The prices on allakhazams seem similar.


>Anyone know of a more current pricing site?

Nope, try the auction zone on your server. You get a good feel for the
price of items. For example, on tribunal I was amazed when the
lamentation one hand that I used to be seen at incredible prices was
being auctioned over and over at like 4 k plat, with no one buying it.
Someone told me this was due to centi longswords in Luclin. 

Barbed ringmails are fantastic bps with 30 ac and 50 hp, they are like
the stonewood mail dropping in the POG pretty much. I see this
auctioned for 5- 6 k plat now. Some of this stuff is great but just so
plentiful.

If you are selling and can port, do what I do. I start sellling an
item at like 1500 plat in EC, Gfay, NK, SK, Nexus, The bazaar, Shadow
haven, the freeports. I spend probably about as much time auctioning
it for that price in all those zones as people do auctioning items in
EC alone. If no one has made an offer in half and hour or so, I start
back in EC only now the item is 1000 plat. Usually I sell the item
around then. If I'm lucky someone will say "how about 1300?" when I'm
trying to sell at 1500. 1 k plat in my hand is worth 2 k plat in the
bush.
