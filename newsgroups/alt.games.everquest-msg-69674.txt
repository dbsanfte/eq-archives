.....Sounds like a job for a Shaman!!!!

 Groups easy..youll have no trouble finding a group...youll be a 2nd rate
healer,best buffs in the game, and the best slow spell in the game...joinin
pick up raid are not a problem. Druids loose their usefulness more and more as
time goes on, and Necro will become mana healers.

Solos like a madman. Each spell level you move up you solo easier and
easier...plus you get a pet as well!!! Druids and Necros solo better.

 Also Shamans are not based on equipment as much as most the other classes..you
will be able to get by with crap gear most your life
