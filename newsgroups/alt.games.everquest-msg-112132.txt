Whats the point though, really?   If your server is anything like mine,
Gorenaire, Talendor and Severilious all have lifespans that are measured in
hours, (sometimes minutes) and respawn times that are measured in days.
Only Esorpa of the Ring, in West Wastes, stays up for any length of time.
Theres really no punishment at the moment for bad ring of scale faction.
Guardian wurms?  What are they going to do, kill you twice?
