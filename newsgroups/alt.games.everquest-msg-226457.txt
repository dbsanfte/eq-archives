I have a 60th level Enchanter who is slowly working towards getting
Dire Charm.  Since DC has a level 46 cap, I'd like to take advantage
of the /con system to help me determine what mobs are DCable.

What level should I be such that L46 mobs will /con as light blue,
and L47 mobs will be dark blue?  I'm thinking probably L61 or L62,
but I don't know exactly how rounding is done...
