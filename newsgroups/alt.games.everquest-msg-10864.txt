Off the top of my head..

To get to FoB from Paineel, you are KoS in much of Qeynos (learn the
sewers), lot's of angry mobs in WK, NK and EK (KoS to the Knight and
Squire), KoS in High Pass, more angry mobs in EC, WC NRo and Oasis (go the
evil route to Kunark, KoS in Firiona Vie), then you get to run through The
Overthere and Warsliks (lot's of big, red angry mobs).  Ny guess is that you
will die a minimum of 5 times getting there.  Wait til at least 8th level
when you can Gather Shadows.  Even then, it's a long dangerous run (you feel
yourself beginning to appear as you are right in the middle of HP with
nowhere to duck and recast).

I made the run at 12th and then set up camp in Kurn's Tower where the bone
chips were plentiful and the exp good til 16 when I left for HP.
