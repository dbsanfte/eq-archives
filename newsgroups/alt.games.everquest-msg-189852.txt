Burger King????  Granted, BK may have better sammiches, but their fries are
not to be considered food, by any stretch of the imagination.  I think they
include them so you have something to get the onions off your Whopper (you
know, the one you just specifically ordered "without onions) without getting
your fingers messy.  Other than that, I consider them non-food material.

OTOH, I haven't had an In-and-Out Urge in a long time (for those who
remember when they still did that to the stickers).  Of course, I haven't
been to CA in a long time, either.
