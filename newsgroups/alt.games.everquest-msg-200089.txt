DMF is NOT stripped on zone-in, but can't be recast once inside. So, have your
friendly neighborhood necro cast it on you just before you zone in and you'll
have about 45 minutes before it drops, which is roughly twice as long as EB.

Items with perma-EB effect are better because you can loot them before getting
rezzed and not have to worry about drowning before you can get another EB. There
are a few items in-game but they're usually at least a couple of Kpp in the
Bazaar. If you have a high-level Tinkerer friend he can make you a Rebreather
for about 900pp actual cost.
