Yes, there are other spells besides the ones for disarming trapped
chests.  They are purchased at the LDoN camp.  Shaman can get an
indoor SoW with ultravision buff and a curse based DoT. Magicians get
a pet buff as well as a self-only buff that can reflect spells back
onto the caster. Those are just a few that I knon; I am sure there are
more.
