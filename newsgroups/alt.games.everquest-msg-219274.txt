I've been wanting to get into the LDoN Guk theme for a while now,
and have had no luck finding a group heading there so I finally
decided to try putting a group together myself.  About 35 minutes
later 6 of us (56 PAL, 52 ENC, 57 SHM, 56 RNG, 52 BST, 55 CLR)
headed into the Cauldron of Lost Souls with the goal of taking
down Advisor Segelan.
We started a bit slowly as I got used to the layout.  The terrain
was somewhat dark and most of the mobs were fairly hard to pick
out.  Also, it's a lot harder to get LOS to target for Pacify
there than in the other dungeons I've done, and our DPS was a bit
less than I've grown accustomed to in LDoN groups.  Things
picked up a bit as we got comfortable working together, but I
continued to have some difficulty spotting and targeting mobs
resulting in several adds as well as a few "premature" pulls
(most of them double pulls) where I drew proximity agro while
trying to see if there were mobs around the corner.  Lots of
caster mobs, but with me interrupting many of the casts and the
Enchanter getting the adds mez'd we made steady progress.  We
had a bit of comic relief when an AE mez woke a "sleeping pet"
and we mistook it for a hostile.
Once the boss spawned I started using Pacify to bypass mobs and
we got to his room in plenty of time (about 20 minutes left).
I pulled the boss from the midst of his attendants and we had
a fairly long battle grinding him down.  He kept me rooted the
entire fight, conveniently summoning me back into melee range
whenever necessary.  When he enraged, the Ranger died almost as
fast as the pets, she did not realize that enrage = auto-riposte,
told me later she had always moved away from enraged mobs but
this time she was rooted and couldn't, now she knows the drill.
Fortunately for the BL he did not get as many hits on the mob
so he was still at about 40% when he saw me say "stop attacking".

I guess I'm not half the writer Monual is, but I'm gonna post it
anyway.  :-p  It was fun, we went in without big HP buffs (the
Cleric didn't even have Temperance) and without over-geared DPS
characters and still managed to succeed.  I don't think any of
us had been in Guk before, and it was significantly harder to
pull than the other dungeons I've done.  It was the BL's first
LDoN group, and other than the Enchanter all of the characters
were strangers to me.  I wasn't pleased with my pulling but I
did well enough (almost wiped us after the boss was dead, got
an ugly three pull while we were killing mobs for xp while
waiting for the dungeon to expire).  I'm looking forward to
going back, I was getting bored with Mistmoore.  Also, it was
mighty nice to get a win my first try at leading a group.

I do have one question for the newsgroup:
Since we killed a "boss" and the Ranger died, does it qualify
as a raid?  ;)
