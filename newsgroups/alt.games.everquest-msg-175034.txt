A person I grouped with told me that my shaman (currently level 42) would
not be welcome in groups in PoP and in raids when I reached that level
unless I had a buff timer; if group members had to tell me when their buffs
were going, that I had no business being a shaman.

I've never heard this before, but if its true, can any of you shamans out
there tell me about this "timer"?

Any help would be appreciated
