I'm sure it was probably addressed in the thread somewhere but it got really
long and boring so I missed it. :P

Innate running speed doesn't stack with SoW or other movement spells...it's
overwritten by them.  I got this from a bard who put her points in there,
and I thought she was nuts for screwing up her bard speed.

Ok, now I know where I'm spending my next 3. :)
