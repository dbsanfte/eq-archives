  You can't summon a mount indoors (ie. most
dungeons, a few cities to boot) so there's a
good reason right there.

  Besides, you must train 6 points in the
first tier before you can train in any of
the second and higher tiers, so you might
as well put those 3 points into run speed.
Go for it, you won't regret it.
