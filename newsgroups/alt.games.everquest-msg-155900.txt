Nope.  They were changed to 10 slots for a relatively brief time (longer
than 2 weeks tho) at or just before the first tailoring recipes that
required more than 8 slots.  Even when they were 8 slot containers many
tradeskillers used them in place of backpacks as they held "giant" sized
items.  Then, around the time of the change to 10-slots, they made the
Large Sewing Kits and several other tradeskill containers heavier (lots
of Monks carried Spits back in the "good old days").  Around the same
time they renamed Large Sewing Kits to Deluxe Sewing kits and put 8-slot
Large Sewing kits on vendors and 10-slot Looms in the towns.
