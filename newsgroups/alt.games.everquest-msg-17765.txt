1- If a weapon's damage times 2 is greater than your pets max damage,
the pet gets the weapon damage times 2.  Give a rusty 2hander to a
elementalkin and watch his max dam jump to 18.

2- Yes, pets proc weapons.  They have to be the appropriate level though.

3- for mage pets from the 24, 29 and 34th level summons you need to
give them weapons to dual wield (they auto dual wield at 39 and up)

4- Necro pets also need weapons to auto dual wield, not sure of the
exact levels.

5- Mage pets below the 12th level summons can't hit wisps and the
like without a magic weapon (a summoned dagger does fine)
