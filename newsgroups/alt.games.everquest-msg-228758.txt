I was wondering if anyone else was having issues such as:

Frequently logging into reset UI's.. like your main character's UI set to
default, the boxes that ask if you want a step by step guide on how to /ooc
"I'm a newbie, can someone give me some stuff?", all the hotkeys, etc.  I'll
get that, then camp to char select and log back on and it will be fine.

There's the semi-new "save" and "load" spellsets... three fourths of the
time it doesn't work for me.  It's NEVER worked on my main character, which
makes me wonder if it's a char dependent *.ini file problem.

Those are two big ones at the moment, would appreciate any insight or
solutions.
