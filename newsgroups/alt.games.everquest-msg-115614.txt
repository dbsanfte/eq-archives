Make a druid.

Get to level 24

Start the Paw of Opolla quest

Camp Gynok in Befallen for both the gold and the plat ring

Beg from greenie rat while you camp, got me to 120 or so

Then make the following hotkey:
/attack off
/doability 1 (if beg is 1)
/attack on
Use it to beg while attacking, for example while you finish off a mob

After you get tired of meeleeing, use snare/dot strategy, when mob are 
running (or rather, standing still) and not rooted, sit next to it and 
met up while you wait for it to die, and beg from it in the meantime.

After 150 or so (heard this number from another beggar, have NOT 
verified it) you dont get attacked by NPCs any more (might still be from 
the beggar hating ones like Guard Fayfear at Orc lift in Gfay), so beg 
every time youre in town for something.

Answer the "what are you doing to XXXX" when others ask.

Repeat untll 200 skill
