I think the key element to this is the fact that people should be
keeping a weather eye towards the future. Nothing is going to change the
fact that today's patch is going to happen. And none of it, as I see it,
is "end of the world as we know it" stuff. However, there are changes
here (which we all "knew" that Verant would *never* make) which open the
door to other changes which we need to watch out for.

Arolpin brings up a fantastic example in a different post in this
thread. What about the death penalty? Go back and read VI's third year
"State of the Game" announcement. They are obviously re-looking at the
things that make the game too "traumatic" for the players. Well, what's
more traumatic than the death penalty?

And yes, I know... if they did remove or reduce the death penalty, you'd
immediately have some foaming-at-the-mouth idiot in here shouting,
"What? You think removing the death penalty is a BAD THING? Show we *ONE
PERSON* who actually *LIKES* the death penalty! What??!! YOU like it?
Well, you're a moron. *PLONK*."

But stop and think about it. What does the death penalty really cost
you? Besides the cybercounting of the underlying experience "points" in
the program, what it really costs you is *time*. Time that you have to
spend to earn that xp all over again. Time for the CR, whether it's a
naked level 25 running from FV to the windmill in LoIO, or a naked level
50 chatting by the bank in the Bazaar while he waits for the cleric to
click his stick, it's all the same. It's time lost that you could have
been leveling in.

With the changes to levels 1-10, they have, in effect, already partially
reduced the death penalty. Several levels, usually spent in a zone other
than your starting newbie zone, where you no longer have to bother
running to find a corpse, looting it, hoping not to get hit on the way,
etc.

VI is making sweeping changes that we all *KNEW* they would never make
in a million years. What if the next one is a reduction in the death
penalty, because it's "too traumatic for the players".
(Waaaaaaaaaaahhhhh). One more step on the road to a playstation style
game in virtual "God Mode". And one more chip away from the the aspect
of EQ that makes it as popular, successful, and just plain "good" as it
is.

The attitude at VI is showing a dramatic shift. Watch that space.
Lokari's comments were right on the ball about them seeming to suddenly
remember that they are a corporation, and worring more about how black
the numbers are on the  bottom line than the long term health of the
game.
