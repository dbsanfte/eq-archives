You can practice pick locks at the locked door in Befallen. It is
easily the biggest time suck in EverQuest, but it will get you all the
way to 210 (as it becomes level-appropriate.)

You can practice find / remove traps anywhere. You will get the "You
have not detected any traps," message, but you will still get skill
ups.
