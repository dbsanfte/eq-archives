I have played since 2000, for me, EQ has become less stable in the past 
year or two than it was earlier on.  Discounting the immediate post 
Luclin release fiasco, it was reasonably stable up til around a year or 
so ago.

I crash to desktop, not LD, about two times a week.  Never seems to be 
related to doing any one thing in particular, not related to how long I 
have been online or how long my PC has been on.

It sucks that it happens, and my general feeling is that the game is not 
as stable as it used to be, however, it is still fun to play, and I plan 
on continuing to do so.
