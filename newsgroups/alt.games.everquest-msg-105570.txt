It all depends on the motherboard you have with your P3, many of the first
generation MB's for the P3 only had a 2x agp port. So you need to check your
MB book and find out. I had one of the old boards so for a little over $200
I upgraded to a new P4 board and a 1.6 P4 and now the graphics in luclin and
everywhere are awesome with my Radeon 8500 64DDR, I am seeing things I have
never seen before and don't have lag.
