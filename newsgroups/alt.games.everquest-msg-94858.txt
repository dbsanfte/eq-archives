You are *so* right.  The faction text bug is clearly the fault of
the users.

Verant could make this *so* much easier on themselves if their MOTD
was permanently hard-coded to say, "Various things that worked before
will probably be broken.  Various things that didn't work before...
well, still won't work.  Good luck!"

Then nobody would EVER have cause to complain!  Life would be so
much easier for the users AND Verant!

Well, rocket scientists are smart, too.  Just not when they're buying
football tickets.

You must have polled a lot of people -- hundreds of thousands --

Yeah, people just SUCK, don't they?  Next thing you know, the damn
morons will be saying things like, "Verant should test their patches
more carefully" and "Perhaps Verant needs some work in terms of
quality assurance".

Jesus!  It's ONLY $10 a month!  We should be thanking them for the
fact the the client works _at all_ at that bargain basement price!
And as for the servers...hell.  I'd say being up 4 hours a day is
plenty for everyone.  People are so greedy.

-Ed, who sees the phantom cursor in the client and LIKES the fact
that it's (still) there!  Go Verant!  Fixing bugs is for loser
companies, creating bugs and then warning users about them in the
MOTD and expecting that to absolve them of all responsibility is
for winner companies who know people will keep coming back for their
crack anyway!
