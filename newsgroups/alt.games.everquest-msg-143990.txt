OK I see that I have touched on a topic that is sensative to some.
Perhaps I should have chosen my words more carefully, although I was
simply using this usenet to verify the feasiblity of a practise
clearly condoned in another forum. 

Opinion seems divided over whether this practise is PLing (or being a
"lazy f*ck", as I have been accused) or whether it is simply an
"unusual" grouping of symbiotic convenience. 

In any case, I think my question has been answered: feasible but
frowned upon by some.

Thanks.
