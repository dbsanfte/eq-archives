Ok, I'm scratching my head.  You're pouring in the tribute more to get buffs
than faction (do you even get faction?) and I've read that you can use
tribute even if you have bad faction with your hometown - the tribute NPC's
are far enough away from other NPC's that, assuming you can invis or
somesuch and make it to the tribute NPC you're in the clear.  I'm not
getting GoD until later today, so that's just puzzled together from what
I've read thus far.
