Just as an update, I found out that after I retired to bed, our guild
hooked up with another ally guild of about our size/level, who sent some
of their biggest and best along for a zerg rush of the beast. She
finally went down in a Pyrric victory, dropping some pretty nice loot,
including four good spells, one of which was Demilich. Needless to say,
the only necro on the raid was more than a little excited.
