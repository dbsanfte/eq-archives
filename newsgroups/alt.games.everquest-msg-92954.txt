Last night, as we were assembling to kill Faydedar, a GM controlled
bard showed up at the hidden oasis, serenaded one of our ladies, did a
repeat serenade for the druid we were killing Faydedar for at our
insistence, and then gave all the ladies roses (Lady's mantle, has a
rose graphic). One of our trolls was unhappy because he didn't get a
rose too :)
