Very interesting point.  He also makes the (blatantly false) statement that
it is impossible to level above 29 without going to Yantis and buying a
million plat.  Sounds like someone who is trying to make some people think
that EQ is impossible without buying tons of plat early on.

Speaking as someone who never saw more than 10K until he was over 50 and
used his entire life savings of 20K to buy Blessing of Aegolism when he was
58, I can tell you that you can level up just fine without a million plat.
Heck, I had cloth armor until I was almost 20 and managed to survive.

He also devolves into insulting people who argue against him and refusing to
answer their pointed questions about his silly accusations.  Sounds like a
person with an agenda.  His original was difficult to classify as a troll
because it was hard to figure out exactly what he was trolling against -
there are far better, more volatile subjects to troll on.  A disguised pitch
for Yantis makes much more sense.
