Im not sure about VS faction, but I know my bard maxed LegionOfCabilis at
warmly. Cant get to ally (except maybe if I went iksar form, havnt checked
this). If theres a racial penalty, then you can overcome that in a number of
ways, probably the easiest being boon of the garou (I wouldnt use wolf form,
do rangers get treeeform?). You will still have your deity penalty, so good
luck.
