> justified"...

taken straight from Prof. Sterba's (philosophy professor @ UCI) analysis of
the situation during a Mid-East Violence forum.

"suppose then we accept  this moral justification for British terror-bombing
during WWII.  Doesn't this suggest a comparable moral justification for
Palestinian suicide bombings against Isreali civilians?  THe Palestinians
have no comparable support from anyone.  It is under these conditions that a
moral justification for Palestinian suicide bombers against  Isreali
civilians emerges."

morally justified?  yes, under THOSE conditions.  Yes, i should of clarified
that earlier.. thank you for bringing that to my attention.
He's not saying its okay to go out and kill innocent people.  he's just
saying that if you use history as a reference, moral justification will
emerge.
THis is a means of retalliation.  its not the best choice in my opinion, but
it is a means of retalliation.  retalliation for what?  a bigger injustice.
