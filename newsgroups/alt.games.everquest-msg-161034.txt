You really wouldn't miss the cleric anyways, if you stayed in pre-PoP zones
until 58.  With slow on, a druid can heal very sufficiently to keep a group
alive outside of the planes.  Lack of crowd control and especially Mana
Regen, would hurt though...  so an enchanter may be a better choice than the
shaman.

Where you would miss the cleric though is that sooner or later, someone will
have an "oops" moment, maybe Evac wont' go off in time, and you have no way
to recover from that.   Both zero exp recovery, and zero ability to return
them to thier corpse so you can continue on.

Even at those levels, the group heals are too mana sucking to use regularly
(so it seems from the paladins I play with.)   They could be a good backup
healer with Celestial, but they dont' get that until 59.  By 59 you'd be
planar, and Celestial just won't cut it there, mobs hit too hard.


For our own "regular" exp group... We add players from guild or friends but
the core members are a Warrior, Druid, Paladin, Enchanter.  (Often a Rogue,
Cleric or Shaman will join us, depending on who is on.)    With skilled
players, theres not very many places you can't go with that.   It's not a
tailor made "perfect group"... but we get the job done a *lot* more often
than not. ; )

(And none of us ever whine about Paladin rezes ; P  And all of us made fun
of the "other group's" cleric that caused a wipe out because they had to
fight out with no healer when she refused a paladin rez...)
