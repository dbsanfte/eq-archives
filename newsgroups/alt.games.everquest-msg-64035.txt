Well, not absolutely. The zone map seems to indicate that from the
nexus, you can either zone *into* the city of Shadow Haven, or you can
zone straight to the bazaar, or off into Netherbian which I'm guessing
is a low level hunting zone. But having good faction with a city so
close to the bazaar and port in site would certainly be useful,
particularly with a bank and merchants and such there. I can't *wait* to
see what sort of faction my freaking troll has all over that planet.
