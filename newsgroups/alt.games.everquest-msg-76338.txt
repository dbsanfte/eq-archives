A few days ago I was staying with a friend in Ocala. He was a 21 monk and I
have a 22 Wizard (These were their levels when we began). We also have a
level 23 Druid friend, who has VERY rich alts because he is great at playing
the market. He groups with us, and gives my monk friend the fungi tunic off
one of his alts while we group (we all know each other well and thus can
trust with things like that). So, we camp the Goblin mines in LOIO and make
great XP. The druid logs and lets us keep the fungi for awhile. So, we sit
there, camping the mines, doing great.

So along comes this Paladin who says that he's just passing through the
mines and that the gobs are green to him. He continue killing gobs, no
problem, completely ignore him. Until my monk friend sees him taking lots of
gobs from us inside the mine. We ask him to leave and he refuses.

Now, according to Verant, we have two options. We can share, which is no
good because with this jerk taking all the close spawns, we would have to
venture deeper, and we dont want to. Our other option is to petition, wait
an hour, have a guide give us some BS about some rule or something, and then
leave.

What did we do? My monk friend took matters into his own hands. He ran deep
into the mine and got 10 gobs on him, includeing some casters. He then runs
them to the paladin and feigns death. The Gobs go onto the paladin. I go
invis just before he comes out of the mine, and follow him. (My friend and I
were right next to each other, so he watched my monitor... I get better
frame rate anyway). We watch as he tries to fight them all, as the gob
casters dispell all his buffs. The Pally is almost dead, and then casts LOH,
restoring his health. He then runs for the FM zone line. He died about 2
feet form the zone.

You know what? it felt good. That jackass saw us hunting, and took all the
spawns we were pulling from, and expected us to do nothing. So we trained
him. We got our camp back and he learned a lesson about courtesy.

Plus we were literally rolling on the floor laughing at him. It was a hell
of a time.

Comments/Flames welcome.
