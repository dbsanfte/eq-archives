It's not random.

It's hardly the video card for most people (my video card isn't strained in
the Bazaar unless I'm goofy and turn all new models on and set the clipping
at max).

I'm not gonna spill what it is because at the moment I know how to prevent
it and I think Sony would just switch to some other method if it became
common knowledge.  My guild, however, is thankful for my insight, as is my
Bazaar trader who can actually stay online for more than an hour now.  :)

And it is sooooo simple.
