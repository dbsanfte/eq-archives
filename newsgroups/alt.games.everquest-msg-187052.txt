My 4th level froglok cleric had no trouble "finding" one (I wasn't
even looking for him) --  Of course, he killed me very easily.

I did peek into Guk with him.  I was surprised that the Guk frogloks
were apprehensive.  I thought that is where the frogloks came from. 
Shouldn't the new frogloks be ally with the Guk ones?
