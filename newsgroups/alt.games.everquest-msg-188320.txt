Not to mention correctable by high gamma or monitor twiddling, good zone
knowledge, appropriate spells in group, items that shed light by the
bucket full and playing in lit zones. I had more blinding from a crap card
I used to use being horribly dark than I did for being a human so overall
night effects are a problem (line up 4 of my mates playing Op Flash
screens all looking at the same thing and hardware alone shows huge
differentials).

GO with the stats and worry little about night blind effects....its only
half the day after all.....
