I haven't paid much attention to caster AA, but I'm wondering how
an idea like the following might pan out (assuming that it doesn't
already exist, tho I expect I would've heard about it if it did):

Simplify Spell:  Allow a complex spell, like Enchanter DDs, to be
cast without the "secondary" effects, which often lead to more
frequent resists and/or higher agro with little or no benefit (I
mean c'mon, how often is an Enchanter gonna interrupt a caster
with one of his DDs when they take so stinking long to cast?).
The "simplified" version of the spell would have the same mana
cost and casting time, being in all respects identical to the
base spell except for the removal of secondary effect(s).

I'm not sure if this would add to the game, or if it would present
balance problems.  But it seems like it'd be kind of a neat option
to give casters.
