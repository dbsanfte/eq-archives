Er.. yes. Indeed. Tried that, it finds nothing wrong with my system now but 
2 512 MB dimms will throw errors. And the RAM's fine, got it replaced 
actually as I was doubtful about it.
Replacing the RAM did not help, so conclusion was that it was the 
motherboard's fault, and I can't be arsed to take the whole motherboard back 
in. Windows still has problems with it, seems to forget to deallocate 
memory, but SuSE doesn't care. So as soon as we get the NWN client for 
linux, we can safely tell everyone with game crashes to change OS :)
