Languages are weird -- a skill increase doesn't show up in your 
character's stats until you zone. What most likely happened is this:

1. You got a point. Looked at stats which said Bad.
2. Zoned. Spam some more. No point.
   [repeat step 2 a couple times]
3. Look at stats which now say Very Bad.

You really didn't get any points other than in step 1, which didn't
alter your stats display until you zoned.

Sometimes it can take many minutes of spamming to pick the point up,
sometimes it happens in the first couple seconds.

The wording in the Stats display changes at skill 11 (Feeble), 
21 (Very Bad), 31 (Bad), etc. NB: They made an exception a while back
for 100 skill in a language to show as Master whereas other skills need
to be 101 to be labeled Master. 

The FV language skill caps are (level+1)*5, that is, 10, 15, 20, etc.
Thus at NO level except 19 can you use a change in the Stats display 
to know when you have maxed out. THAT is annoying.
