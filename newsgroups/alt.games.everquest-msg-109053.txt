Well this is fine for those that play alot.  I am lucky if I play 6 hrs a
week.  The only reason I stay is because I group with friends once a week to
play for around four hours.  During the weekends (if I am not working or
doing honey dues) I get to play a little more.  It doesn't pay to sign on
and only play for an hour every night.  Maybe they should start charging by
the hours a person plays.  I can aford 6 to 8 dollars a month.
