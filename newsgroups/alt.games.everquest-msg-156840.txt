Man you are just SO off in so many ways in your own little rant about this!

Manaburn was the first concession VI ever made to wizzies visa vis our power
in EQ vs. D&D which EQ was supposed to be modeled on. We finally had the
opportunity to do MASSIVE damage FAST. The way VI went about nerfing it,
even a GM admitted it's totally broken at this point!

Y'all are about the worst class to be ranting at wizzies considering you've
been given a reprieve from the nerf bat on your slay undead AA! As for
raids? Yes, we're still important but one of our VALUABLE tools has been
rendered totally useless and wasteful.

Do pallies need a big leg up? Hell yes! You sire, on the other hand are in
dire need of an existential enema.
