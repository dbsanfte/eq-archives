Warrior is dependent on equipment, and if this is your first char, your
equipment will barely cut it. The problem will just get worse and worse as
you gain levels.
Id go for a class that doesnt require great equipment, but rather gets its
power from spells. A druid or cleric can get by with total rubbish equipment
just by joining a group and merely casting spells. A necro can get by
without a group or nice gear because his spells/pet are enough on their own.
