I went around to all the stores today to try to buy the titanium pack.
No one had a copy. Ominously the guy at EB told me that they no longer
plan to carry anything on shelf for EQ1. He said they still got stuff
for EQ2. Even Best Buy had all their copies disappear too. Now how the
hell am i supposed to get the 4 packs i am missing that are only sold
in the titanium pack for $20?!!?!
