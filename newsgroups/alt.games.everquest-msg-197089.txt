We've already been through this, I think with the same poster.  It is
very possible to solo a Druid into the 50s without learning much of
anything about other classes.  Hell, it's easy to play a Druid that
far without learning how to group one effectively.  That being so, it
seems to me that it's counter-productive to attack the guy for trying
to figure things out, now that he's gotten the idea that there is a
lot more to the game than he's learned so far.  Now, if he had a L52
of a more group-dependant class you'd have a stronger argument.

Oh, and one other thing...  Even if he were an ebayer, wouldn't you
say it's best he spend some time learning the game with a lowbie alt,
where his mistakes can't cause too much pain to others?  I really
can't see any good reason to slam the guy for his post, even assuming
"the worst" as you do.
