Why can't a group of 56's do DoN missions (and actually, since the level
range is up to 10, why can't a 56 group with up to level 66 characters and
do DoN missions, assuming they aren't a 56 cleric or tank in a 66 mission)?

It's a serious question btw, not trying to cause a fight, I just wonder why
it doesn't work.
