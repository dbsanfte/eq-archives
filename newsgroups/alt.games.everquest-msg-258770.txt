The chance of a proc firing on a given attack is determined by the
proc frequency (subject to several variables) divided by the current
attack frequency (i.e. the attack frequency after adjusting for haste
and/or slow).  So, with a very slow weapon you can get the chance of
a proc on any given swing to be pretty high.
