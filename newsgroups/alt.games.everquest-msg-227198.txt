My mage cares a good deal, very happy with regen 3... compared to 
something silly like "has to summon food and drink less often".

Soloing, I have no heal spells for myself.  If badly injured, I have 
bind wounds (again, stacks of bandages are no problem, in fact since I'm 
lazy enough to use Gift of Xev for my food and drink needs, I get 
bandages without even an extra cast), which speeds things up to the 50% 
mark, but after that, any lost HP come back only from regen.

I have a self only buff which gives me 4 hp per tic, my native sitting 
rate of what, 2 per tic... so regen three gave me half again the regen rate.

Even in groups, I instruct the healers not to heal me if I'm only 25% 
injured and not being beat on; save the mana it will come back pretty 
quick on its own.

Why am I hurt in the first place?  Well, sad to say it does happen. 
Solo, sometimes adds go for me instead of pet, if I can't get them onto 
the pet this means die or zone, but often I -can- scrape them off.  Or 
sometimes on the pull, the mob tags me as I round a corner or something, 
or pet decides to path funny when told to attack and I get slapped a bit.

Then there's falling damage if I don't have lev on (I usually do), and 
of course AE, traps, and mod rods.

And I even get overnukers' aggro every now and then if I'm pushing the 
envelope; if that never happened at all, then I'd know I wasn't doing my 
best.

In all those instances, I'm hurt, but whatever hurt me has stopped, 
there's no emergency, and my regen will take care of the problem on its 
own without a heal needed.

IF there was anything else remotely interesting in tier one (beyond run 
speed, which is ten times, a hundred times more useful than regen to me) 
I'd not have taken it, but I'm very happy with it considering.
