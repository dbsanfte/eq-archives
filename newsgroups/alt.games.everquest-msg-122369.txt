You are aware that Feign Death works differently for mobs level
32 or higher, right?    Below level 32, FD should always mem-wipe
the mob.  After level 32, FD has a small chance of mem-wipe
unless the mob has returned to its spawn point, when the chance
of mem-wipe is around 90%.  If the mob isn't mem-wiped its aggro
range for you is a LOT larger than in normally would be.

What you're describing is typical FD problems for a mob level 32 (or
higher) which either isn't allowed to get back to its spawn point or
where the mem-wipe didn't work when it did.   That's "working as
designed" and the only way around it is to either /q out, flop your
way to a zone, get CotH'd (over a distance sufficient to mem-wipe),
or get Succor'd.

Generally it's faster to /q with a wandering mob that might not get
back to its spawn point for a long time,  But if you can watch the
spawn point it's fairly simple to wait for the mob(s) to return and
then stand-up, see if the mem-wipe failed, and immediately FD
again if they didn't.  With a 90% chance of mem-wipe, you'll
eventually clear aggro.
