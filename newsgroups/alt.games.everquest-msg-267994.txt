Whenever you get bored and feel the need to move on. I wouldn't move on 
before about 170% though so the Citizenship Quest dings you straight to 
level 8.

My current scout has been 220% for quite some time and is around 35ish in 
all the harvest skills so a ways to go yet. A few more nights should be 
enough to reach 40 in the harvest skills and get tradeskill level 10.

Newbie island is great fun though when your level 6, I would recommend 
staying as long as you can. You wont get better return for effort anytime 
soon than being in a good Captain Rockbelly group that is for sure.
