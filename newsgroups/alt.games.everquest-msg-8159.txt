thought i would intro myself since ive started posting here,  i never lurked
here so forgive me if i break any rules here, but if i do im sure Avenger
will point it out for me in his own Eloquint and intelligent way,. LOL. i
get the feeling its a pretty easygoing group judging by the several dozen
message long threads made up of only brat avenger and maybe one or too
others. I dont kill filter people if there entertaining, and for the most
part i find stupidity funny.
