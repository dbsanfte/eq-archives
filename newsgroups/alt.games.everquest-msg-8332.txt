Do to the addictive nature of these game types, I am reasonably sure that EQ
servers will be around for quite a while. The only thing that will really be
a threat to them is newer games with better graphics. But is encouraging
that Verant does appear to be able to scale up its graphical engine every so
often. The underlying mechanics of the game is very good.
