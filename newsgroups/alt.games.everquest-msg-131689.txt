Needlites would be a good choice because Echo is also off of Shadowhaven and
easy to get to.  There are also a few other camps in Echo that you might be
able to find a group in.  You might also try Netherbian, it is right off of
the Nexus and so it's easyt to get to. It's not heavily camped and you can
usually find a group.

I have spent a lot of time in Highkeep, and it is good exp and a good zone
to hunt because it has all the conveniences right at your fingertips.  It's
easy to get a bind right upstairs from where you will be fighting.  That's
also the bank and there are merchants etc... all close by.  As mentioned
also though, it does get a bit boring hitting the same gobbies over and over
and at times can be VERY difficult to find a group.

SolA is excellent exp at your level, but you will not usually find a pick-up
group there.  You will need to take a group with you, which will mean
finding others who want to go, getting gates etc....  Also, you would want
to get maps and learn a little more about the zone before you go.  In fact
it would be best to find someone playing an alt, who has experience in that
zone before going.
