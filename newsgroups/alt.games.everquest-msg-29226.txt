In theory, you can make anything once you reach level 25 and get
the skill.   You won't have much success, though, and alchemy is
an expensive tradeskill.   Ingredients for the Bone Field potion cost
about 188pp, for example.

Alchemy is level-dependent by the following formula: (level - 24) * 5.
So, at level 25, you can have a maximum skill of 5.   To get to where
Bone Field potion is trivial, you've got to have a level 58 shaman
who has practiced the skill enough to get the skill increases.

In short, starting a shaman just for potion making seems a bad
career decision.  ;)


Here's a good site on alchemy:
