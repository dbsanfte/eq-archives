DT, even if we start with your example of a bucket with black and white
balls, if a random sample is taken, the odds are good it will be
representative of the overall population.  It is not guaranteed, but the
odds are good.  The odds of it being accurate can furthermore be calculated,
and in a good survey will be included as the margin of error.  It is
certainly possible for the survey to be even less accurate than the margin
of error implies, as the margin of error is just a calculation that gives
you some given certainty level of the accuracy.  Basically you end up saying
something like, I am 95% confident that these results are within +/- 5% of
the actual values.  If you want higher confidence levels, you take a bigger
sample, or live with a larger margin of error.  I am in no way stating
anything regarding the accuracy of this particular EQ player survey, I don't
know enough about it to have an opinion on it's accuracy, I am just saying
that a properly conducted survey is a reasonably reliable method of
determining information regarding a population that is too large reasonably
conduct a full count.
