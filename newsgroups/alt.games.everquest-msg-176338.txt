Go to Warsliks Woods, in the caves that hold the entrance to Dalnir's Crypt.
There are two rooms, one holds 2 brutes, the other holds 3 brutes.

I hunted here in my low to mid 20s, and the place is excellent to fear kite.
The brutes don't assist, there is no faction issue, the only problem is once
in a while one of the brutes would fall under the world (stupid pathing) and
my pet would poof trying to find him.

I don't remember how many HQ brute hides I finally walked any with, but they
did seem to drop fairly regularly.
