Slight tangent regarding web sites. I signed up for the premium service
at eqprices.com so I could get a printable price list. However, it's
nothing like I wanted. It shows just magical items I guess. I was
looking for standard prices on pelts, etc., in addition to trying to
find the promised server specific price lists. Does anyone know if this
stuff exists on that site? If not I want my money refunded. I emailed
the admin. of the site a couple of time but have heard nothing from
them. I'm going to be pretty fucking pissed if they scammed me.

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
