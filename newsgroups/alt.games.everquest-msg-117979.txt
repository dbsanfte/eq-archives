You're welcome.  Love to help out a fellow rogue and offer advice when I
actually can.  Still being a newb myself it doesn't happen as often as I
would like.

I agree with your understanding of the term rogue.  This is also what I had
in mind when I chose to play a rogue.  Unfortunately the developers of the
game had a different concept when they created the rogue class.  I enjoy
playing my rogue anyway, but I have also started a Shaman and a Necro, for
those times when I cannot find a group.  At higher levels with a good weapon
you will amaze your friends and family by backstabbing for 200+ and with
dual wield and double attack you will be a damage machine.
