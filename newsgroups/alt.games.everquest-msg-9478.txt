    This is what we are learning about this GM who is abusing his power.
This is not the only guild apparently that has witnessed this GM abusing his
power.  My letter to them tells the rest of my story.

    About GM Rhuyai, I have been banned by this asshole. I e-mailed Brad
McQuaid and he told me it was tough luck and he will stand by the GMs
decision. bmcquaid@verant.com I was banned after a suspension in OOC for
cursing. My next offense was this - supposedly a threat on this life of the
person it was directed towards. I Guarantee ya it was not a threat on their
life. Coojer says out of character, 'And I got your KID, Any time you wan
tto open your mouth and stick the barrol in it just feel free.' Forewarn
your friends and guild that this GM will ban you for anything he feels is
improper behavior. Eventually the whole server will end up banned with his
beliefs. Though I'm known to be very aggravating in OOC if people keep
egging me on, I do not think it's worth Banning a lvl 54 wizard with over
250 days played on his account. I see it all as poor judgement. We, will,
all, be, banned eventually. I am suing Verant and need supporters for the
cause. I'm hoping to get a plan where your offenses are forgotten over time.
My first suspension was over a year ago. You might say I have been a damn
good boy since then. It's just unreasonable to ban after incidents are so
far spread apart. Further, I think games need an element of aggravation to
add to the reality of it all. It is a very well known fact that people love
a good fight and like to assert them selves in that manner from time to
time. It's human nature for God's sake. There is a strong possibility that
the complaint sin petitions have the cadre confused about what it really
happening. They should be very aware that things take place during fights
that people always regret later. I might petition somebody in OOC that is
having a bad day but I would not want anyone to have to lose their account
unless there was no other way to stop them from using OOC as a toilet. I do
not agree that being warned for it twice in two years is an abuse of it. Now
if somebody logged in and did it every time they logged in, that would be a
ban offense after and only after they had three fair warnings and
suspensions. And if they keep it clean for say 6 months, then the past
should be forgotten and refreshed to a clean slate.



    Thanks.
