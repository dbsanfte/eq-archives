   My psycho room-mate (no, not Lenny) bitches about getting
unasked for assistance.  He's playing a level 50 something
ranger, and is thinking of asking the PoD for a book to turn
in to that he can't get these unwanted heals and what not. 
When asked why he would ever do such a silly thing, he
replies "I want to do this on my own, (with his mule cleric
on a second computer in tow), not by being helped by these
friggin....."
   Yes, he really does say "friggin".  Yes, he is serious. 
And no, I don't know why the hell he isn't playing some
single character game instead.
