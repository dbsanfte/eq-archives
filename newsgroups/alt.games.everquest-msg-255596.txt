72% slowed is just 7% more slowed than 65% slowed.. but look at it from 
the other direction, instead of 35% normal speed its going at 28%, this 
is 20% more slowness.

I recall having a similar conversation some time ago, comparing the 
various high end caster slows; trying to see why people cared about the 
difference between a 75% slow and a 70% slow.  Again, that additional 
slow, which looks like only 5%, is really taking the mob from 30% speed 
to 25% speed, a 1/6th reduction in its DPS.

If a mob normally does 100dps, a 65% slow takes it to 35DPS, and jumping 
it up to 72% means it drops to 28DPS.  The difference between 35DPS and 
28 DPS is quite noticable.

If this can be extended to the 75% slow, the stuns would take that mob 
from 25% speed to 20% speed, from 25DPS to 20DPS.

If you could stack the stunners perfectly you could actually get larger 
than normal returns; instead of reducing damage merely by 20% of the 
current total (as you do taking 65% to 72%) you could reduce it by 20% 
of the original slowed amount; ie another 7%, to 79% slowed.

This is because stuns don't really stack, they take out a chunk of the 
melee time of the mob; to prove that this is true you need merely 
consider a chain stunning cleric or enchanter; slapping out stuns in 
cycle they can get mobs down to 0% speed, the mob never gets out from 
under stun, never gets to hit anything at all.  If stuns stacked 
normally, you'd go from 20% reduction to 36% reduction and so on, 
smaller chunk taken out each time so you could never get to 100%, but 
thats not what happens.

In fact, each sequenced stun actually has a larger effect.  (still 
working with the fantasy stun that does 20% speed reduction) Cast one 
and you reduce 20%, to 80%, or with our 100DPS mob, 80DPS.  A second 
stun, as long as it doesn't overlap the first one, takes out another 
20%, reducing the mob to 60% or 60DPS... but going from 80DPS to 60DPS 
is a 25% improvement.  A third non overlapped stun will take that to 
40DPS, a 33% improvement over the last one.  A fourth non overlapped 
stun will take that to 20DPS, a 50% improvement over the last one, and 
the final stun will take that to 0DPS, which is 100% better than the 
last one!

For this to work for berserkers, you'd need three, timing things so each 
hit stun 4 seconds after the previous guy.  Since I've seen Cheal chains 
timed closer than that, this isn't theoretically impossible at all, only 
trouble being that in 43 levels I've grouped with exactly one other 
berserker... and of course you do see resists with berserker stun just 
like anyone else's.

Still, stunning doesn't reduce our DPS output at all, nor are we running 
down mana reserves; in the long run we're running thru axes so we can't 
keep it up forever, but from a practical standpoint I've spent most of 
my berserker life chain stunning almost every mob I kill (exceptions 
being casters where I hold stun till he starts casting, and some 
encounters where we really want the MT to hold aggro even at the cost of 
mob doing more DPS)

A stack of components yeilds 400 stun axes, and a backpack holds 200 
stuns worth of them made up ready to use on a single mob if it came down 
to that; thats 40 minutes worth of chain stun from me per inventory 
slot.  Is there a level 65 or under mob which takes over 5.33 hours to 
kill and which must be permanently stunned the entire time?  If even 
tiny breaks are allowed where we can make more axes, we could 
dramatically improve even that time span, instead of carrying only 
backpacks full of premade axes we could carry one bag of components, 
which is sufficient to fill 20 backpacks on top of the other 7 we could 
be carrying already made up.

Crazy talk I know.
