just wanted to say welcome back! here's my two cents...

if you did want to keep playing splendid, you wouldn't notice many changes
until you got the gear to support them . .. but the point is that the class
has been upgraded (though feedback goes both ways)

bards really are the cat's meow ....mostly for pulling (get fading
memories)...you'll never go lfg for long...and you can solo up to 65, i know
a guy who's doing it as we speak . .. and he aa's too, gets one every hour
or so in tier1....boring, but he has something like 70 aa's and is 63, and
did all that solo and very quickly

and you mentioned beastlord also...you'd have to start from scratch, but the
beastlord is a very powerful class ...admittedly it's all offense, but it's
setup such that you can solo just about any level you want and groups love
beastlords

best of luck, and i'll see you in serverwide.age !!

btw we have to continue that discussion of mana input being the great factor
in a group's output =)
