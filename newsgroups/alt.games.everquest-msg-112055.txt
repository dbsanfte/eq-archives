It means deliberately waiting somewhere for MOBs (monsters) to spawn so
you can kill 'em and take their stuff.

I'm surprised you're hearing this much in the context of EQ, though.
Camping is a pretty integral part of the game.  Perhaps you're hearing
this in the context of First Person Shooters, where it refers to sitting
somewhere hard to see or hit, usually near some powerup or the other, and
picking off people as they come by?  That's considered to be bad
etiquette in FPS games.
