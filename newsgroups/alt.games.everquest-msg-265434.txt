I run a script that kills all but the most essential services and processes before I start
any game.

With regards to spyware and other nasties, I keep my system spic-and-span.

Hmmmm, never thought about the audio.  I've got an SBLive 5.1 on the PCI bus.  I'll see if
that's the holdup.

I don't expect that the card itself is the bottleneck.  It's something else, probably not
even hardware related if I'm any judge of it.

I wonder if the new EQ engine is able to leverage my card as well as the Doom 3 engine.
