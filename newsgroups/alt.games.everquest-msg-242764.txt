Barm's Tips for Melee Management
By Barm McLir of the Saryn Server (Originally found at Shaman's Crucible's
message boards
      There are times during your career as a shaman that you'll find
yourself grouped with those crazy melee type classes. I offer the following
tips for working with the gate-inhibited:

      Melees are poor at math and don't understand that 20 mana is less than
100 mana, thus they keep pulling. You can help the tank visualize your mana
bar by keeping his health bar at the same level. Some warriors cannot
comprehend this either and pull anyway. This is called natural selection.

      Paladin get a very annoying ability called Lay of Hands that they
carry around like a personal get out of death free card. They will happily
pull Venril Sathir to your right courtyard group confident that LoH will
save the day. It's imperative that you "fizzle" a few heals, forcing them to
burn this right away. Now, your group is relatively safe from your pally for
one game day.

      Monks get a similar ability called Mend. They tend to be more selfish
in its use, so make a hotkey saying Monk, please cast MEND on %t. and click
it every two minutes. If they try to claim they can't, tell them your
brother's 16 monk can Group Mend. Then accuse them of being ebayed.

      Tanks think all casters med at something like 500 mana a tick. When
you report your current mana they, despite being poor at math, mentally tack
on another 30% to compensate for .003 second delay your message spent
traversing the internet. To correct for this, subtract 30% from all mana
reports. This is called the "Scotty Principle."

      Rogue twinks are your enemy. They join the group with 15 hit points
left dual wielding 10/10 weapons that proc Insidious Taunt and immediately
demand haste. You cannot afford to heal rogues. Give them something with a
boot icon -- Scale of Wolf for instance.

      Many people do not understand the Ranger class and think they are like
that dirty, unshaven guy from Lord of the Rings. Nothing could be farther
from the truth. Rangers actually follow very strict principals of honor like
Shaolin priests. Under their Bushido-like code, nothing brings more shame
than being healed by another. Pat Morita explained this all at the last Fan
Fair. He did say they were kinda dirty.

      Keep your pet alive over all other group members. You can justify this
by explaining that your 55 pet costs 50 mana more than Reviviscence. Be
warned, they will try to confuse the issue by pointing out that you can't
even cast Reviviscence. Go into a long dissertation regarding the concept of
community mana and the respect thereof.

      If melees ask for strength say something like, "Yeah, that would be
sweet -- maybe this drolvarg will drop it?" [Optional] Then cast Maniacal
Strength on your pet.

      Some shaman suggest casting buffs on yourself or a pet as timers so
you know when to refresh. While this may sound good on paper, it does not
factor in the warrior who clicks off each buff every few minutes trying to
check the names.

      Don't get angry at the tank who responds to your "OOM" with "haste
plz". What they really mean is, "Hastily get thyself to the zone while I buy
you precious second with my unworthy life's blood, Good Priest." It's just
hard to type all that between the crunching sounds. Respect the dying
request of this proud roleplayer.
