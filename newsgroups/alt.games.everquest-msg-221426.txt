First, a solo warrior's down time is not spent sitting on her
buttocks waiting for HP to regen.  Its spent bandaging up to 50%
hp.  This is so much faster that regeneration isn't even slightly
competitive with it.  So the key is to find mobs you can kill
using less than 50% of your HP bar.  Take 40% damage, you are
down to 10%, then you bind wounds back up to 50% and repeat.

However, if you want a mostly solo class, I'd advise staying away
from the warrior altogether.  Yes, there's something satisfying
about being a big hulking brute that can just shrug off the
massive amounts of damage the mob is doing to you while you do
nothing but hit it repeatedly with a big chunk of iron till it
keels over or you do.

But you can get almost the same "I'm bigger and stronger than you
are" playground bully feel from the other two "plate" classes,
and each have a lot more to offer.  Paladins have real heals (not
large ones, mind you) that mean you can get your HP back to full
for each fight, instead of always relying on 50% of your HP
bar... and can heal themselves a bit mid fight too, in case the
fight you thought you could pull off with 10% remaining is down
to 10% and the mob still has 20% left to go.  Not to mention
stuns to allow you to take on casters, lull to allow you to pull
singles (which a warrior desperately needs to do) and root in
case you get more than one mob anyway (all a warrior can do at
that point is run for the nearest zone line... or find somewhere
to die where getting her body back will be easy), and buffs to
raise your HP and AC up to comperable with the "self buffed"
warrior.  Shadowknights get FD so they never have to stay in a
fight they don't want, and can also single pull, plus they get
snare, which prevents messes from running near dead mobs, and
Fear, which allows them to kill mobs without ever having to take
damage, plus a little pet that adds to their damage output
(particularly at very low levels, when a simple Fist of Bone will
give them the same damage output as a level 12 necromancer's
pet.)

Thats not even delving into the thrills of monk, ranger,
beastlord soloing... only melee class that solos worse than a
warrior is the Rogue.
