While this approach ( hate kiting ) can work, its annoying at best for your
melee, who have to stay in melee range of a mobile target, one that probably
isn't moving in a straight line either.  And at worst its a quick ticket to
adds
or to lettting the mob beat you to death.  Indoors you often can't move far
without running into aggro range of more mobs, and also often can't circle
around out of melee range without getting stuck on a wall.  Bard snare
is also quite unreliable, with a max duration of 18 seconds and a fair degree

of resists, probably because its both snare and slow.

Hate kiting when you have a pet up works much better, as pets have
a very high degree of skill when it comes to staying on target and in
range for melee.  If I have a pet though, I want to get it beat up!  I
might try for this if partnered with mages or necros sometime in the
future, since we'd just as soon their pets not get beat on.
