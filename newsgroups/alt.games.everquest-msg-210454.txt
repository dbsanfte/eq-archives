for 2 or more mages with improved reclaim and (optionally) quick
summoning and elemental pact, it's not useful for even that.

When one pet is nearly dead, reclaim him for 95% of the base mana
used to summon him (about 380 mana for 61 air) and recast him for
as low as 300 mana avg (SCM3, Spec Conj, Mana PresIV) and send him
in.  The advantage this has over regular pet chaining is there is
always a pet on the mob, allowing you to reclaim and recover the
your mana.

With QS3 the summon takes 6 seconds.  

12 mage took down Velketor this way on Bertox (IIRC)
