Take lower toon, multiply by 1.5 and round up - they can group up to that
level. Only odd thing I've seen in this forumula is that, sometime when it
comes out even you seem to be able to add one, and sometimes not.

To caculate down from the higer toon, divide by 3 and then multiply by 2 -
round normally.

Essentially, the low toon has to be 2/3 of the high toon's level. A 40 can
group with a 60, a 39 with a 59, a 20 with a 30. Etc.

When awarding xp, keep in mind that the xp award is proportional to level.
So, when he gets a level 17 toon to group with his 25, then the 25 will get
just under 60% of the xp total awarded - all of this before any adjustments
for the mob being green (xp basically thrown away) or cyan (xp at 50% as I
understand it).

So, just for grins, if a mob is level 15 and you are fighting them with a 25
and a 17 (a total of 42 levels), let's say, just for ease, that the mob is
worth 10 points of xp after the Zone Experience Modifier (not the actual
number), it should work something like:

Level 25 gets 10 * 42 / 25 = 6 or so, but that get's tossed because the mob
is green, so zero xp in the end.
Level 17 gets 10 * 42 / 17 = 4 or so.

Hope this helps.
