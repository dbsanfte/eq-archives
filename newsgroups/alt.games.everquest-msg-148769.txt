Eek, thats a pretty bad analogy. Maybe if "the secret of making a pizza
without onions" was hidden in a book in the library, so they'd have to spend
days/months going through all the books. Fixing bugs isnt like flipping a
switch. Granted, theyve had quite a long time to fix things. But it bugs me
when non-programmers think that fixing bugs is as simple as knowing the bug
exists.
