BLASPHOMY!!! The gods will strike you for that 42  :) 

LoL  it human nature to get stuck in a rut and resist change. Its also
human natures to finally realize change is an irresistible force.
After leaving EQ I found a game that works better for me, no illusions
that its in anyway permanent just nice for now. Really hope EQ2 does
turn out well,  but think chances are higher of me hitting the Power
Ball...
