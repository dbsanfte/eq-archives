It's worth noting that caster MOBs in that condition regenerate mana at
an ungodly rate too. This is what gives rise to the common myth that all
MOBs have infinite mana. In fact, only non-aggroed MOBs do, in that they
can't cast faster than they can regenerate.

Of course, a healer MOB can quite happily heal a MOB that's fighting
without being aggroed itself.

Unless you can kill your first target despite it being chain-healed by
something with infinite mana, this means it is time to switch targets to
the healer...
