so i started up EQ for the first time in about a week last night, and
spent an hour or so downloading patches.  well, actually, it was about
THREE hours, since the patcher ground to a halt about six times and i
had to hit Cancel and restart EQ.

that's happened to me several times over the past few months -- the
patcher will just stop transferring data.  the send/receive lights on
my modem will go dark, and the patcher just sits there with a frozen
progress bar until i click Cancel.  heck, sometimes the patcher freezes
before it transfers ANY files -- it just sits forever at the "checking
for new files..." stage.  but clicking Cancel and then restarting EQ a
few times eventually works.

the problem doesn't appear to be with my ISP/connection.  i say this
because i can open up a browser or a telnet window while the patcher is
hung, and they work fine.  and i can always click Cancel and restart
EQ, and the patcher starts up again.

but i know enough about networking to know that the kind of connection
used by browsers and telnet (TCP) is only one kind of connection.  is it
possible that my ISP provides a good TCP connection, but is unreliable
on other types of connections (UDP)?  what sort of connection did the
old patcher use?

i realize all this may be academic, as i understand there's a new
version of the patcher now.  but i'm still curious.
