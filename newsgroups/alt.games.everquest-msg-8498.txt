They claim 30+, but based on what I know, that's pushing it unless you have
a large group, lots of protection, or are a glutton for punishment. I am not
a big fan of "super raids" and the like, but I've come close to buying it
several times simply for the interface. In fact, I know of quite a few
people who have done just that, even though they could not make any use of
the new zones.

To be frank, somebody with the expansion will be able to tell you better
than I. Going on memory, I believe all of the interface windows are
transparent, even when in the inventory screen and such. The spellbook is
the only exception. The windows are also adjustable in size and location,
allowing you to rearrange the interface as you see fit and generally make
things much more comfortable for yourself. I've seen screenshots of people
that had all of their interface windows stacked up on the right side of the
screen and sized down a bit, for instance.

Maybe somebody with the expansion can explain in greater detail?

That's all well and good, but they will clearly matter to you if they decide
to ban your account for using the program, which in addition to having some
handy little features, also has some features that are damn near cheats.
(They won't ban you for twinking, by the way.  ;-)   )

As I said, doesn't matter to me if you use it ... but if you are going to,
you had better be aware of the consequences of doing so.

Great. It won't sway Verant, I'm sure. Again, just pointing out that the
"cheating" you are so firmly against is what you are partaking in according
to the only people that matter. Verant. Doesn't mean I agree or disagree,
that's just how it is.

Naw, that's fine. I can understand being curious about EQMacros and wanting
to tinker with it. I'm curious myself, I'm just unwilling to face of the
consequences of doing so, hence, I don't. Just be sure you understand what
you're tinkering with if you decide to use it to play the game.
