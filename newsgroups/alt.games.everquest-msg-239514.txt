In a word NO a level 12 cant do this quest.  Well strictly speaking a
lvl 12 with a bucket load of pp & a lot of 55 + friends probably could
but from your cemments this isnt the case.

Why lvl 55?  Cant say if that accurate in terms of level, however
you're unlikley to get Seb group much under level 50 that is capable
of killing Reets (are there still pickup groups in Seb or is it BYOG
now?  Years since I was last there.)  The item you need to get from
there is

Reet Froglok Crown   
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  
Weight: 0.5 Size: SMALL 
Slot: HEAD  
AC: +12 Fire Resist: +20 Cold Resist: +20  
Classes: All Classes  
Races: All Races 
Slot 1: Type 7 
 
The rest of it you may be able to make a start on by collecting elf
parts and pp.  The Bazzar is going to be the easiset place to find

Velium Mastodon Fur Cloak   
Weight: 4.0 Size: MEDIUM 
Slot: BACK  
AC: +10 Str: +10 Sta: +10 Cold Resist: +10  
Classes: All Classes  
Races: All Races  
 
or the components to make it if you know a 250 tailor.

Unless you particularly want the crown for the illusion I'd put it
aside as something of a fun quest for later in life.  The stats on it
are pretty poor relative to other items that are a lot easier to get:

Crown of Deceit   
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  
Weight: 0.4 Size: SMALL 
Slot: HEAD  
AC: +12 Cha: +15 Magic Resist: +10  
Classes: All Classes  
Races: All Races 
Slot 1: Type 7 
Effect: Illusion Fier'dal
