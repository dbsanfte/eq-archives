Your INT is immaterial to your success rate, only your skill level matters.
Let's say a skill of 30, plus geerlock, that's 32.  The currently more or
less accepted formula for trivials below 68 is (skill-Trivial+66), so that's
80% in this case.  So, 50% is a bad run.  Of course, the formula could be
wrong too.
