I played on test and when I logged back to my regular server I noticed
the rats and bats had new graphics.  If your friend has dial-up,
patching will take (I am told) about an hour, and patching back the
same amount of time. I have a high speed connection so I copied my EQ
directory to a diectory named EQTest and play on test there.
