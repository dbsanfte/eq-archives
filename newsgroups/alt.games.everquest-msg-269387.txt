Where? The reward structure for soloing.

First a quick comparison.

EQ1 number of kills solo to get through level 43: ~60
EQ2 number of kills solo to get through level 25: ~400

EQ1 was mostly against blue con mobs (near but lower than my
character's level). EQ2 was against mostly yellow con mobs (near but
above). 

The disparity is staggering, and this is at barely more than half the
level. Some quest experience in there will help out in EQ2 but not by
much - at that level only the best quests give more than 5% of a
level, and usually its more like 2-3%. As a soloer, and playing more
than casually but not to extremes, I could get a level a day
comfortably in EQ1. If I actually had the patience to do it solo all
the time in EQ2 it would take three times as long and that's at barely
above newbie levels.

Basically, soloing is nonviable in EQ2. Now don't get me wrong,
soloing should not be *better* than grouping like it is in WoW until
its endgame (and in some ways even then). That causes so many problems
of its own its an even worse situation. It caused enough problems in
old days of EQ1 when only two classes could actually solo faster than
group, let alone *all* of them. But it has to be at least worth doing
as an option. In EQ1, soloing rarely got you any loot worthwhile (a
few exceptions but basically it was very rare in comparison to what a
group could get). Your reward tended to be experience. And a group
could get experience faster than anyone outside of a charmsoloing (not
DC) enchanter or swarmkiting bard. But you could still *get*
experience as a soloer and progress well that way.

I fully understand and support the "grouping > soloing" concept. But
when "soloing = 0", it's gone too far. I just don't want to bother
with a group all that often. Too many of the other players are
retards, and that goes for pretty much every online game. I had the
patience to grind my way mostly solo through L59 in EQ1 back when
there was no one in my class at L60 on my server and levels were still
a major part of progression. It took two weeks (for that one level).
So I have the patience if I want to get through it. But that was one
level with the lure of no more leveling after it was done (this was
Velious era, no aa yet). It was not every single level from the end of
the early game on!

I like to twobox too, which would solve this problem. Except EQ2's
requirements are so high I can't run two instances of it on this
computer, and the computer, while not cutting edge, is still not that
shabby, certainly not in the upgrade range.

So I think I will not go past EQ2's free month. That is sad, because
it looked like a pretty cool world. I wanted to see more of it.
