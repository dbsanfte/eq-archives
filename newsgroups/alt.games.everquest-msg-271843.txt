Keep in mind that this FAQ has been passed down through several
administrators over the years and dissected several times by everyone in
the newsgroup, new and experienced players alike. It was not compiled
with any sort of gross lack of new player perspective. 

Also, what you suggest may be more harmful than good as it could lock
people into thinking that is the only way to play. There are a number of
different ways to accomplish many of the different group
responsibilities under various circumstances, according to the players'
preferences at the time. Playstyles and personal preference don't really
have a place in a FAQ. 

Lastly, just taking your example of pulling. Personally I find that a
pretty simple concept that really needs no description. It's really
automatic if you've played for even just a few hours total. For example,
if you see a group of monsters and you know they would kill you if they
ganged up on you, what are you going to try to do? That's right, you'll
try to just fight one, so you will carefully approach one that may be
farthest from the others and give it a good smack, or hit it with an
arrow or spell from a distance. If it comes after you by itself, you
will likely back away from the others as well (if you struck from melee
range), ensuring that the others don't take notice. But what if the area
you're fighting in is crawling with other wandering monsters as well? It
wouldn't take long to realize that there are certain areas nearby that
are safer than others (perhaps you used one such spot to med
unmolested). You run to that spot, knowing that the angered monster is
hot on your heals. 

You've just practiced the art of pulling as well as splitting groups (to
some degree) without any instruction at all.
