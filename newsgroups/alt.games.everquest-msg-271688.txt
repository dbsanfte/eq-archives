Oh, my God. That is just too funny. I am not a fanatic. I like Apple 
products and think highly of the company that produces them and have 
said so, but that does not a fanatic make.

I do not like Microsoft products, which I personally feel are inferior 
to other alternatives in many cases. I do not like the company's 
management for their actions historically, which altered the computer 
software market such that many companies went under who produced quality 
software and at one time offered consumers choices of products. What 
choice do Windows users have today for office productivity software? 
Well, they can buy from Microsoft, Microsoft, or Microsoft. And think 
what you may of my view but the fact is the company was convicted in 
court for criminal activity in relation to this history and that verdict 
stands for itself.

I made no commentary whatsoever regarding capitolism or whether there is 
some cure needed for it, nevermind whatever that cure might be. I will 
give you credit for having a creative mind though. I don't know how you 
came up with that conclusion but it was good for a laugh.
