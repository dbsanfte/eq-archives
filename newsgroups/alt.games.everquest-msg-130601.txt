Dark Elves aren't KOS in most of Qeynos, if I recall correctly.  I seem to
recall having no problems with my agnostic Wizard, and a friend with a
Cleric was OK except near the Wiz/Mag/Enc guild (and there is a wanderer on
that faction).  I'm pretty sure this was before either of us did any faction
work there.
