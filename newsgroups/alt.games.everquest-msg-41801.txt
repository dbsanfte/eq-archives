Not a bit.  If the American government was supporting terrorist that
went into other countries, I knew about it, and didn't do anything
about it, and sent my kids to their camps, and was proud of them
for dying with a grenade in their Teletubbies backpacks, would I
deserve a bit of the pie when the other countries sent a nuke into
my house? In my view, yes.

They know.  It's discussed in church, in the marketplace, in Ali Baba's
Used Camel shop.  They dislike it.  They support it with food, labor,
and money, as well as malleable children.  Tacit support does not have
to mean strapping the gas canister to your own back.

And probably a lot more are worried about this, lately.  That's the point.

I don't think we should exterminate the entire population...just the 85%
that live along the track the B-2's would fly over.  That would make
us problem solvers, because you CANNOT reason with 'em.
You CANNOT scare 'em.  You CANNOT get 'em to see that this
was a bad idea.  Your only solution is to give them more problems
to worry about than us...for the next 437 years.

Must not be very many, if it's still there.

Must not be very many, if it's still going on.

Actually, yes.  Both of 'em are stupid.  One is more effective.
If you throw a big enough rock or blow up a big enough bomb,
eventually small scale retaliation has no place.  It becomes a game
of one-upmanship that nobody wins.  Unless you can throw up
the big rock that gets rid of the other guy once and for all.

That's ok.  I don't ask you to agree.  I don't ask them to agree,
either.  I don't care if they're upset with the regime...if enough of
'em were upset they'd take back their government or die trying.
Day to day living is no excuse...if you're too upset about the local
government to live there, but too spineless to rally support and
fight for your own freedom, then run.  Get out.  Take your kids.
Don't keep 'em around long enough to where THEY think you're
outdated, and the C-4 backpack is the height of school fashion
this year.
