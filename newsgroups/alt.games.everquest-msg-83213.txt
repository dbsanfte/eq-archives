Dunno about worst.. but ones i'm amazed people choose..

Lvl 7 Monk on Tunare - Qeynosguard (dunno what happened to him)
Lvl 20+ Barbarian Shaman - Colonic Irrigation (Thats just weird)
54 Druid - Dishwasher Safe (What amazes me more is that he planned this from
the beginning.. not like hmm.. get to 20 and then think of one)
I believe the one who started the name nazi problem was a lvl 60 DE called
Karn Age (Pretty cool name even though it states in the policy that you
can't have Karn.. but the fact they let him get to 60 is bad enough, they
ended up changing his first name too without asking apparently)
I once saw a noob running about named Jennajameson, she was a woodelf
offering lewinskys for plat.. some people have too much time
Ogre Noob Warrior - Gunnaphuqyooup (Gunna F$#k you up)

I sure there are more that people have noticed but with only speaking
english I agree with other people that there would be hundreds about which
mean something in another language.
