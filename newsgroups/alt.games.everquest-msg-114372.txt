  Because he enjoys the game?

  Bad CS is only a problem if you happen to need help from CS, which usually
you don't when you're playing the game.  Quitting over bad CS would be like
quitting because you think a one or two zones are really badly designed.
It's one facet of the game/service, and may not be worth quitting over to
everyone who holds the opinion that Verant CS is poor.
