    About time the gimps moved on. The Rallos fight is very complicated,
about the most complicated I've seen, and they need to focus if they want to
kill it and move on to the loot fields of the elemental planes. My guild is
flagged for all the elemental planes (I missed the first Solusek Ro kill
this weekend - I lacked two Sol Ro tower trials - so I can't go into PoFire)
and last night the loot parade in PoFire began. Tons of 135 HP/MANA items,
and even a cleric 2HB with 200 HPs/225 MANA and 30 to 35 in a bunch of
stats. These items make VT loot pale in comparison.

    They were supposed to be undead, as per a patch message, but somewhere
in there that got nixed. They are regular mobs, not undead. If you look at
early screenshots (promotional) of Vex Thal, you see mobs with names like
"Centien Banshee". I'm convinced that in the first incarnation of VT there
wasn't a Qua, Eom etc. naming convention, and when those names were added
the undead part of the mobs was dropped.

    And all four-arms split that aren't bosses. All of them.

    And the XP isn't even very good as far as raid XP goes. Doing the five
Tower of Solusek Ro trials over the weekend got me a full AA point - VT
never came close to that, and took much longer.

    You have to fight that. Stop paying attention and something will Gate.
If something Gates, you stand a fair to high chance of wiping depending on
where it was pulled from. It's one of the drawbacks to the raid XP system.
When we were first there, the all-rogue group and the all-wizard group would
fight each other for kills and put out amazing DPS - no slacking. Now, they
get XP no matter who gets the kill so why take risks or even pay attention?

    Bad monk, no biscuit. The first step is calling pretargets for mezzers
and MA/SAs, then click up! So you know what I mean: monk feigns, clicks on
orb. He goes to the next level, feigned, and never gets aggro. He then
targets the mobs in the room, one by one. A person in his group /assists off
him, then mezzers and MA/SA assist off the person down with the rest of the
raid. That way as soon as you click up you have your target and things go
smoothly. If you aren't doing this, you should start - makes clicking up
much less of a hassle.

    "Listening to monks is the sure path to death."

    Clerics are a WIS class, and it shows!

    You should be able to avoid repops if you flatten against the wall. We
take forever to decide loot, and we only got caught by repops if someone
decided standing in the middle of the hall was the thing to do.

    It gets worse. Remember the first mini-Aten you fought, in the tall room
with the secret wall? Remember the orb in that room that you were told not
to click on or you'd be sent back near zone-in? Guess what happens if you
land on top of that orb after being Grav Fluxed! At least that experience
has helped me in some way - I don't click on the PoK books, I just run
overtop of them and get ported anyways.

    You didn't bind in Umbral Plains? Bad Monual, no biscuit! The corner
nearest the zone line is usually safe from any trains to zone, and you can
usually make the zone in case the place is a real mess. And that way you
don't have to cross ME, and get through the meat grinder at ME/Umbral zone.
You know, the zone line that turns into an absolute mess once 50 or so naked
folks all training various mobs go running to it?

    Eeew. Rumblecrush popping once you're inside VT is a pain in the ass. At
the very least you're looking at a naked bard kiting around something that
will kill him if it gets close.

    It's a good idea for any long fight. If you're in a group, there's
always a temptation to heal someone about to die and you just can't do that.

    "My lord, I have a cunning plan!" -- Baldrick, various Blackadder shows.

> Aten Ha Ra will be pulled into the antechamber.

    Eeew. Why not in the big room, to one side of the throne? And did you
remember to pre-debuff?

    How many people took 20 K falls? That's always a fun part of the Aten
fight, the number of people that get buggy 20 K falls. And for the really
lucky people, they take a 20 K, get ressed, and right after looting take
another 20 K!

    It is. Aten is a loot pinata.

    You will, because:

    Our big joke with the other guild doing VT now is that they're going to
go there until their guild leader gets every item he wants, then they'll
move on. ;-) Having VT gear really makes a difference when moving on to PoP,
especially stuff like the Vengeance items.

    Break it up into two six or seven hour days, then. Most guilds clear to
TVK on day one, then clear to Aten on day two.
