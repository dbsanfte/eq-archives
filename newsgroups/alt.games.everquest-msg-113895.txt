A successful Evade brings a rogue's aggro rating for a particular MOb
down to zero. By level 55, 95%+ of evades are successful. Even when I
fire my deadeye and don't evade for it, I rarely gain aggro unless I
want it. I spend nearly all fights behind the MOb.

An epic, fully-hasted level 55 rogue with pre-NToV gear will do 3300
to 3900 SDPM (sustainable damage per minute) A similarly equipped and
buffed monk will do 2700 to 3000.
