But this might be explained a bit by the storyline. There has not been a
choice but to concentrate around the major cities. But atleast the
qeynos people did retain or remade some of the environment they came
from. Freeport suburbs seem to be designed exlusively by ogres. :/

If they wouldn't allow people to freely choose which suburb to live in
these places would be more different from each other I guess.
