I bought mine in the Paineel SK guild. Shadowknights can't do research, so their
pets which are our 20 and 29 pets are on vendors.

Go to EC through the false wall in the SH rogue area. Turn right and click on
the dead-end wall, which is really a sliding door. Go straight into the cave all
the way to the back right corner. The necro vendor is in a tent back there.
There's a necro trainer in the big building in there, and there's a banker out
on the balcony.
