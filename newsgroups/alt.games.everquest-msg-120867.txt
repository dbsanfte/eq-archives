hmmm Deathgrip... I could agree with you due the the Rez... yet
Paladins can rez... oh and so can Necros.... not sure if SK's get that
ability....   
But Complete Heal is not the end all....  Use complete heal at the
wrong time and your toast and the group is in turn toast...  Often the
smaller heals have a less chance of pissing off the big bad guy.
I personaly prefer my heal over time spells... but I use what tools I
need... the tools that are supplied for my job... the "Cleric Job".
Those tools are not given to a druid/shammy, because they again are
"Not" clerics... 

Good hunting to you
