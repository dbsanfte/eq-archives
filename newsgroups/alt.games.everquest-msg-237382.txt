Priest of Discord, I think.

I remember when my daughter and I were running around with a new
character in a new city, hailing all the NPCs to see what they had
to say.  We hailed the PoD and he offered us a book.  What the heck,
we took it.  He said something about reading it and handing it back,
so we read it.  Fortunately the book made it pretty clear that
handing it back would turn us PvP, so we hastily destroyed it and
went back to hailing NPCs.

I asked a friend about it and found that indeed, it used to be that
all new characters started with the book, but apparently that made
it too easy for newbies to turn it in without understanding what it
was, and the GMs got tired of turning people back to blue, so they
made it a little harder to screw up. :-)
