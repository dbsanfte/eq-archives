"Given what you've written here" is pretty key.  I've got to  believe
that there's a little more to the story than someone who is squeaky
clean saying "I killed that bastard Lord Xyz" and getting tossed from
the guild.  I've never known a guildleader quite that trigger happy.
If she was, it would be a guild of one.  This smells more like someone
who had tussled with others in guild before, and this was the final
straw.
