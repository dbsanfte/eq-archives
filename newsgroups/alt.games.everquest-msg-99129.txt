Yes I know that. Some numbnutz had obviously decided it would be a good 
idea to password protect the channel when he left so it would persist. The 
fact that he had no way to tell the entire server the password and that it 
doesn't matter anyway if it gets deleted since it would be recreated when a 
new person joins, didn't seem to enter into it.

Suppose you're the moderator of a password-protected channel (because 
you're the last one in it, you got in knowing the password), there seems to 
be no way to remove the password protection to make the channel open-access 
again.

It only takes one idiot to get mod status in a public channel (because they 
were the first person to log onto the serverwide auction channel or taxi 
channel or something), and they can password protect it then bugger off, 
noone else will be able to get in for 24 hours until the channel is 
deleted...
