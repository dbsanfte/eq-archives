Now the faq up for the legends server says you DO keep your stuff.

http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/faq.jsp

"4. I already know that when I move a character to a Legends server I
get to keep all my stuff, titles, factionï¿½ everything. But what if I
cancel and go back to my old server? Will the unique items that I've
discovered on the Legends server go with me?

A. Absolutely. Anything you earn on a Legends server you get to keep."

or
http://help.station.sony.com/esupport/esupport/consumer/esupport.asp

and search for legends

"Here is the solution: EverQuest: If I discontinue my EverQuest
Legends service will there be a fee to move back to my original
server(s)? 

You will be moved back to your original server at no extra charge.
Your characters will be moved back fully equipped minus the EverQuest
Legends server specific items."


Verant does not even know themselves, I guess!
