}I know that mages were screwed before.  I think all the pets are avail now
}in Katta, though.  I don't have a mage, so could be very wrong.

My mage dinged 20 a while back and still only had the 16 water pet.  So I 
made the trip to Katta and looked on everything that even vaguely looked 
like a mage vendor, but didn't find the 16 and 20 pet spells.  It's 
possible they're there, but I just missed it somehow.  So if someone -did- 
find them there, I'd love to know where. :)  I did find the spells 
eventually on the lady in the tower on AC island in OOT, though.
