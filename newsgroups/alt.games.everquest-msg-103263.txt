The founding fathers were brilliant and EXTREMELY careful with the way
they wrote the document.

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed."

You cannot take the sentence apart. It must stand as written. No part
of the verbage is "meaningless". Two points are covered. The first
being the right of every citizen to keep and bear arms, and the second
the right of these citizens to unite for mutual defense.

In order to have a "well regulated militia", the citizens that make up
said militia (should they decide to form one) must have arms to begin
with. 

The whole concept revolves around the liberty and freedom exercised by
a community to gather and defend themselves. Pooling thier resources
(the arms owned by each individual) to protect and defend each other.

The concept of forming a militia seems archaic to someone living in
the USA today, but it happens every day in many countries that are
overrun with petty warlords and petty revolutions. The world is NOT a
safer place today than it was 200 years ago.

A "free state" is NOT one where only the government is armed and the
citizens are not.
