Well I don't know about you, but I had a lot of fun, had several characters
in the level range to see what was going on in many of the different zones.
None in the Rathe zone, but I did check out EK with my 18 wizzy.  I was too
low to stay, but took some crazy screen shots before I made a beeline for
the zone.  :)
I got some nice things for my young enchanter to wear, and she had some ok
stuff before that, but a nice bracelet is always welcome.  Not to mention
some mad experience for a level 8 in WC killing Minor WW.  Picked up an
earring for my ranger, and a mantle for my pally.  All in different zones,
at different times of the day.  I had a great time playing this week, and it
came at a time when I was starting to feel a little stale.  So no complaints
from me.  I guess I just must play on a server that had more fun, too bad
you felt that it wasn't that good.  Does this mean that you didn't pick up
any goodies for yourself?

Ok my cp.
