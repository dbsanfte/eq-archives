<snip story of non-corpse run in Hate>

Congrats on the recovery!  Monks are wonderful,
but rogues really shine for CRs in Hate...long as
the Loathing Lich doesn't see you while walking
to where somebody else (who's not invis) is...

Quick tip:  Leatherfoot raider caps, halfling only
versions.  One INSTANT click cast of gate to the
West Commonlands.  MUCH better than any other
gate potion, as a veteran of 6 naked solo Book of
Souls runs can tell you.  Heck, I've been seen by
a scorn banshee one time and made the run all
the way to the bedside table while being hit a
couple of times (was SoW'd before the port), grabbed
the book, and had plenty of time to gate out.

Those  caps are lifesavers...
