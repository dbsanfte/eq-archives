No, no, no, dwarves are just slightly taller than
normal. I can live with that. They don't go around
calling we halflings "shorties". And gnomes, well,
gnomes are about normal height too.

I mean, if you can fit such an admirable, appropriately
laid-back race (and with such a great sense of humour!)
as halflings into such a *suitable* height why would you
need more?

Personally I always thought dwarves looked stouter
than halflings anyway. :-)
