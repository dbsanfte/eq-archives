Has anyone here ever had problems canceling their EQ account? I'm like 
99.99% sure I canceled my account back late July/Early August but a 
charge just showed up for 8/28. I called and of course got the "oh well, 
that's just the way it goes" run around. Even though I told him to check 
my last login date to confirm I hadn't logged in since then. It 
basically comes down to my word vs. their system. This was so long ago I 
can't say that without a doubt at all that I actually went through the 
entire cancellation process but I sure as hell meant to (i.e. perhaps I 
thought I had completed the cancellation but didn't click the final "ok" 
or something). I'm curious if I just didn't do it or if they goofed and 
whether I should take this the next step (calling my CC company and 
disputing the charge). Since sony does NOT send a cancellation 
confirmation, there is no way for me to know for sure what really 
happened. Anyone else experience this?
