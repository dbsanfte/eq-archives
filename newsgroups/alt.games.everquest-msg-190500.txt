At worst, then, you could say he's defrauding SOE (although they really
don't lose money from his plat sales), not the people he's selling to, since
his customers get to keep the plat.  On the other hand you could consider
him to be selling a service (transferring plat from a character owned by him
to a character owned by someone else).  You see, his characters don't own
the plat.  The characters he sells to don't "really" own the plat they
bought.  However, his characters have something unique.  They have the
ability to move plat from their own bank accounts to another player's bank
account.  So he sells the service of making that plat transfer, since
otherwise the customer would have to put in the work of hacking Yantis's
accounts to get that plat.  So, you see, in one way of looking at it he's
not selling something he doesn't own, and therefore is not committing fraud.
