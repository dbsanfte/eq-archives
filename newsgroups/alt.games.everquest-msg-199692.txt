I love chantkiting when I get to play my bard (not often).  One of the best
lines from the Aliens movie (second one) when their lieutenant tells
everyone to put away their weapons... "What does he want us to use?  Harsh
language?"  So I'll be zipping across EW with a crowd in tow, steering clear
of the forts (only place anyone ever camps) and people ask what I'm killing
the mobs with...  "Harsh language!!"

I still haven't gotten the hang of charmkiting, though.  As I understand it,
you get a pack together, charm one of them, get it beaten almost to death,
break charm, charm another mob, and kill the first, right?  My problem is -
after breaking the first charm and charming a second mob, how do you get the
almost-dead one retargeted to finish it?  It's in the middle of this pack.
