}I saw one clown camping Pyzjn 24/7 2 weeks straight. I think it he was a
}level 28 rogue for whom the GBS could have no value other then to sell or
}twink.

I camped Pyzjin for quite a while... 24/7 for two weeks, I give even odds 
that he actually finally got his GBS.  But I seriously doubt he got more 
than two...

}During his entire 2 weeks there he continually spammed "No one come near the
}ruins, it is my camp!". He had the mistaken belief that killing a single
}undead in the ruins would result in Pyzjn popping less often. So for 2 weeks
}straight no necros could go there to farm bone chips, no clerics could use
}ward undead, no monks could putrid rib bones.

There is a prevalent theory that she will pop if you leave all the dark 
skellies up except the one at her spawn point.  True or not, we'd never be 
able to even test it with people coming by and interfering all the time.  
Sounds like the real problem was that he was awfully rude about it.  But 
if you're trying to test a theory like that, and you have someone walk in 
the middle of it and screw you up for another 72 minutes enough times, 
you're bound to get a little testy, aren't you?

I'd still be interested to find out if it worked for him.  It strikes me 
as a highly illogical theory, but hey, it's a pretty illogical game.  And 
it makes more sense than the 'Varsoon has to show up first' theories.  To 
me, anyway.

}Honestly, he was the lowest level I have ever seen camping Pyzjn. Typically
}the people camping her are level 40+. Pyzjn is a level 15 mob.

I managed to kill her with a 13 Enchanter!  But she dropped a rusty 
dagger, and then her pet killed me, and I was back in Oasis... oops. :)

}Understand that not everyone doing the camp is a jerk. I have seen high
}level characters who give out bone chips to young necros and putrid rib
}bones to monks. Kind of a cool way of camping if you insist on doing it.

Yep, that's generally my plan.  The people most cut off by my camping are 
people doing the monk quest, so they get free ribs. :)
