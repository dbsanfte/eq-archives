I have a great new lvl 30 Human Bard, and I just love playing her!  This is
my first Human character, so I'm occassionally struggling with my poor
vision in dark places.  I have a velium round shield that I wear to lighten
things up for me when I'm in battle in a dark place, and I use my
ultravision song when I'm just wandering around in dark places and not in
battle.  Is there an item that I can wear all the time that will serve as a
light source?  Maybe something in the range slot, or a ring or something?  I
like being able to dual-wield and don't like it when I have to put my sword
away and hold a sheild.

Thanks,

Liat Swiftsong
30th Bard
