A 60+ grouped mage who is OOM 75% of the time is incompetent

As a 61 mage I've seen lots of combat without C3 - I still
nuke continously.  I sit on my horse, and I mix staff nukes
with SoFB, and I rarely drop below 60% mana.  When the shit
hits the fan I nuke as hard as aggro lets me, and when it's
all over I get to FM before anyone else in the group.

This is without  MR2's - pre nerf they required a healer to
actually regen mana like that.

A 49 mage can beat 95 mana per tick unbuffed, so long as
he has plenty of malachite, and an enshrouded veil (about
1k)

a 59 mage with 27aa (min) is looking at 153+ mana per tick,
includinge Phantasmal protection and eating a rod every 5
min.

Jaytee (65 mage in FoH) does something like 250 mana per
tick when he bothers to canni.  As with most mages that
high, they find that they are constrained by aggro, not
mana regen on how fast they can nuke.  He says he only
bothers to after a rez.
