Hehe, ill agree with you on that. My damage before level 20 sucks because of the
cap, and could probably find some better swords to use at my level. Only reason
i got the Felhammer and GBS is because i got them as part of a trade, and
thought they could be usefull as weapons, instead of running out and buying some
lower stuff that i would have to upgrade later.
For the CSS i use it because i like the ok damage ratio, and dont feel like
downgrading to another weapon with less damage, since i would have to upgrade it
again later.

Cannot really compare the damage output from my weapons to much other weapons,
since this is my first warrior, so dont have much experience with the warrior
weapons.
