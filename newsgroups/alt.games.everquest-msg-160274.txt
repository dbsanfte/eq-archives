No, not "any" animals, just quite a few.  It is handy, but its not going
to save you from every situation.

I'm not familiar with barb BL specifics, but as one example, my Vah Shir
is non-KOS to the cougars in Iceclad but is KOS to the seemingly identicle
cougars in EW.  Alternately, look at the Drakkal wolves and the Coldain
wolves in GD; almost everyone is KOS to one and not the other; there are a
few "kill everything regardless of faction" people who are KOS to both,
and a few more, like my bardling, who are deliberately KOS to neither.  At
any rate, the fact of them being animals has little to do with their
reaction, which works off coldain/kromzek faction.
