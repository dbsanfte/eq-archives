    Well, remember she's a High Elf, and not one of those crippled Gnomes.

    Thank you. I'm still not happy - like I said, the resists are fairly
poor, STR is still a minor issue, and you can never have too many HPs or too
much AC. But at least when I play her I can play an enchanter properly, and
not be a wizard with mez like some twink ENCHs. I think I've cast every
spell she's been able to cast with the exception of the stat debuffs, and as
you know that's a LOT to get a handle on. I also like that excepting the
GEBs, most of the pieces are pretty cheap. Heck, the collar was bought off a
Firiona Vie merchant!

>I can't really advise you on equipment...I know almost nothing about it.

    Drat, I was hoping to learn about it. It's odd, but I actually enjoy
reading stats and piecing together equipment lists - must be the min/maxer
in me looking for a good puzzle.

    Yeah, I LOVE that it shows up in Illusion forms, too. Makes the
non-robed races look a bit more clothed, which is always a plus - she got
the blonde wood elf face, and being naked on top is a bit too much
attention.

>I upgraded it to a Siren's Scale Robe that I stumbled on

    After hearing my buddy report from HS last night, I'm itching to go and
pillage the south wing. Lots of quality stuff down there, like enshrouded
veils, bloodpoints, and golden bracers, oh my!
