no. they're advertising you won't get nailed by someone elses train. 
they aren't advertising that they've implemented extensive aggro 
management code that maintains lists of which mobs are part of which 
pull(s!!) to ensure that you will pull aggro if you pull a mob from one 
train, but that same mob will ignore you if you pull a mob a 'different' 
train, or otherwise independantly pulled that mob.

at best i think if you happen to be sitting there medding, unengaged 
you'll be safe... barring an AE of course...

if they include some sort of non-aggro state while engaged with social 
mobs it looks pretty easy to exploit.

I think you're pulling on it pretty hard.

Massive contortions? FD pulling... training to zone lines... these are 
routine in EQ1... hardly contortions.

The only contortions come about when you try to resolve the 'no trains 
will jump you' with 'no simple exploits'. I'm not the one suggesting 
that those contortions were made though; I'm the one suggesting they 
haven't been.
