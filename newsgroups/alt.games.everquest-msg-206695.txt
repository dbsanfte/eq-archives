Just MHO if you need pp, which you always do with your first character, you
should do some camping for good loot + exp vs. just going for levels.

For lower levels, Warrens is quite good. You also kill every wisp you see
and turn in the GLS to the gypsy.

In another level or two, I would move your ranger or chanter to SK and kill
the hermit. He drops fine steel weapons and always spawns at level 20. Kill
him all the way to 27-28 and you should bank about 500-700 pp.

Have you been camping the Tes Mas Gnolls in SK? They have pretty good drops.

There is one group of NPCs that consistantly have *GREAT* drops for their
level, but their spawn cycle is so slow you have to do something else to
kill time. Cycle is so slow, I camp and run another character for an hour or
so.

Go to the entrance to High Hold Keep and look *out* from the entrance you
will see a path that leads up the side of the hill. You go up that path and
make the first left. In a small hole there is a dwarf bandit and two human
bandits. I think the highest level is maybe 20-24. They will attack you
immediately on entering but you shouldn't have much trouble at level 30. If
you do have trouble, just run to the guards and they will help you.

The bandits consistantly drop gems and bronze weapons. I've never seen
another NPC that drops gems more frequently anyway.

You don't really make a lot more then you do in another area because of the
slow spawn, you just do it quickly. Do something like run your chanter
killing wisps for 30 minutes, then login with your shaman for 5 minutes to
kill the bandits.
