Its not like we havnt heard that a million times already.
Try dying a few times *yourself* in 54, then 55 and see how you feel about
it.
I dont like the option of people disconnecting-cheating, but I dislike
living in fear of netdeath more. As ive said, I guess it gets down to how
good your connection is. Its easy to be generous with someone elses misery.

I suppose if neither option is aceptable, then its just bad game design.
Diablo2 let you quit out anytime, you dont have to "pull the plug", yet
people are dying a lot more than in everquest. Obviously theres no 30 second
timer like in eq, since u can just quit anytime anyway. So if your
connection goes down from time to time, its just not that big of an issue in
d2.

D2 is better than eq in so many ways, yet sucks in others, especially the
online "community" if you could call it that.
