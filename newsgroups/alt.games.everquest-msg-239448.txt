Thank You!  I have generally held that communication is for getting the
message across.  If that goal is reached, 'nuff said.  As for the spelling
errors, cannot understand how my spelling is in error, because, IMNSHO whil
ROTFLMAO and BTW FYI OMW.  When we learn to read this sort of EQ-speak, it
affects our brains and normal spelling functions crash like the sign-on
server after a major weekend patch.
