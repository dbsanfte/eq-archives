Grieg's End and The Deep can be fun zones to crawl around in.  I
really like GE.

Pros:
====
Almost always empty.  
Huge zone.  Looks like indoors, but all outdoor buffs/spells work.
Nothing sees invis.
Nameds drop stuff that is either reasonably worthwhile selling in
bazaar or turning in for decent tribute points.
Rare luclin zone that mobs actually drop coin - and gems - and
words/runes that can be sold in bazaar too.
Mobs drop way faster than PoP tier 1 mobs, yet give almost as much AA.
My feeling is my kill rate is way better in GE than a tier 1 so I
think I solo AA a bit more efficiently here.

Misc:
-----
My beast solos here easily.  A bard/beast or bard/beast/dru group
should tear it up handily AND have a good time.
I usually come in from the Dawnshroud side.  The first room might look
daunting, but don't panic (have paragon ready though if you go there
to solo).  Of course, with bard lulling you can single pull out of the
first room to the entry hall.  3 mobs there with chance of a 4th fro
the trap.  As a beast, I usually get 2 at first and manage to aggro
the 3rd (and trap mob) almost every time.  =\
Speaking of traps - most rooms have a carpet patch - avoid it when
pulling.  The carpet spawns an extra mob (spawn time roughly twice as
long as the rest of the rooms).

Once you've tanked down the first room, pick a direction and work your
way through the interconnected rooms to the courtyard.  Kill the
courtyard mobs and then decide your goals.  

1)  Go further in and wander for hours in a damned large zone =)
2)  Take the route that leads back in the general direction of the DSP
zone in (glance at a map and you'll see that there's kind of a loop of
rooms there.  Many call  this the "front loop").

The front loop has a chance of 3 random named spawns.  You do this
loop once or twice and you're definitely gonna see a named.  They are
common.  More hp than the others, but don't hit much harder.  Oh -
and, while fighting a named, watch your party.  you may see them
change shape...  Makes for amusing screen shots.  =)

There are some other interesting rooms and pull techniques to learn
about, but I won't give it all away here.  You'll learn 'em quick
enough - and the zone is forgiving enough that as 65s you'll have some
leeway in what you can get away with.

I like to bring 50-something friends to GE.  They tend to rave about
the exp and I've yet to meet anyone who didn't have fun there (except
me, the first time I tried solo at 58 and got pwned in the first
room!).
