I have a similar Dell system, and I love it.  But I'm a bit worried about
the ATI Radeon 9700 Pro graphics card that came with it.   I've heard some
reports that some games won't work well with it.

I don't currently own EQ, but I'm very curious as to how well it plays with
the 9700 Pro card.  Could you do me a HUGE favor and post your experiences
here with the game and the card after you get everything up and running on
your new system?  I'd really appreciate it.
