Well, for my three post Run 3, I opted for the regen. I *almost* have 
the fourth point needed for SCM2, and that's where I am on the AA. Since 
we just duo a lot, it makes more sense for one of us to bandage that 
high, but it's faster if he just casts an Eye of Zomm for me to lifetap, 
rather than do a lot of bandaging. I may go back and get the First Aid, 
but I'm going to do that after I get the archs I want, Natural 
Durability 1-3. And I am still foolishly considering spending the AA so 
I can GM more than one tradeskill- but not until I have all the skills I 
want.
