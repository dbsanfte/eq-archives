And that's the thing.  I was aware of the smithing items being for sale in the
bazaar at 100 plat plus.  But the guy wasn't saying, "hey we looted 8 of those
granites, can I buy them for 800 plat" or whatever.  He was asking to have
them.  
If you know up front you want those items keep the market value of them on your
person, so you can be ready to pay for them before the loot split is done.
