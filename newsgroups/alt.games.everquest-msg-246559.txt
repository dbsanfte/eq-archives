Hello,

I am one of the many who is pulling my hair out after the "upgrade" to DX9.
I have an NVidia GeForce 4 Ti 4200 128MB 8x AGP Video Card.  I run 512 Ram
and bought the computer less than a year ago, to play EQ specifically.

My problem is that I often times get a "cone" of pixels right in my view.  I
can't see anything at all when it happens.  Sometimes moving left or right
helps, but not always.  The cone effect seems to be worse in areas with a
lot of rocky type terrain (i.e boulders/ big rocks)  I see it a lot in EC
LDON Missions.

I have tried all the recommended Sony snake oil fixes.  To include
installing new drivers.  I then uninstalled them because they were no good
and went back to old.

Anyway anyone else having this and if so do you know of any fixes??

Thanks,
Q from Innoruuk Server
