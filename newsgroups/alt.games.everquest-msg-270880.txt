That's highly speculative. Server hardware needs to be maintained and 
replaced. Its not unthinkable that SOE is leasing as well, and possibly 
on annual subscriptions to database licensing...

Whether leasing hardware and subscribing to database licenses is smart 
is a separate debate. I wouldn't be surprised if EQ was doing it.

Probably do them the most good to call a spade a spade. Announce EQ is 
dead as far as continuing development, and sell it to another company to 
manage the servers for as long as it can make a profit at it, and 
collect licensing as a percent of the management companies revenue or 
something.
