You need to complete a est first.  As you find each butterfly, examine
it, and add it to you colection.  When you have 4 from a set, the
description in your quest journal will change to, eg, Plain Butterfly
Collection.  Go to the guy in North Qeynos, and talk to him - you'll
have the option to give him the collection.  He'll take it, and give
you an item (box of butterflies, I think).  Examine this, and you'll
get the quest for the other 2 sets.

Make sure you've examined the butterflies, though - if they're sitting
in your bckpack, they don't count.  This is true of all collection and
Lore items.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
