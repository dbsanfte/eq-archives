Pre 50 almost anyone who can cast Healing can be a primary healer.  I've
been in many groups, including KC and Seb, where a Paladin has been primary
healer, and he does fine.  What makes clerics the supreme healers is at
level 39 when they get CH.  When you get a tank with Full HP buffs and only
use CH to heal him when he gets to below 1 bub, you're being more efficient
with your mana than any other healer.
