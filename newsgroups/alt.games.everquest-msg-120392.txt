   It's Everfrost for me.  I learned the basics of the game as a young, untwinked,
and untutored Barbarian Shaman.  I've decides to live my life here-on-out as an Elf
Cleric, and as such Gfay is my "home" (though I hate the place, and created a back
story that involved me being exiled from the place).  Everfrost is pretty out of the
way, and I don't visit it often anymore.  But I do get the warm fuzzies when I do,
even after almost  two years.
