As you didn't mention what class you were I'm guessing you're not a magician,
druid, wizard or necromancer, all of whom can summon their own source of light.
Lightstones are probably the best you can buy from a vendor. Greater lightstone
is better if you can find one, a Split Paw mask is also a good source of light
IIRC. HTH. :)
