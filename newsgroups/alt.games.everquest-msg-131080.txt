I find that I actually enjoy the (very) occassional "epic" CR.  There
isn't be a whole lot of point to playing a risk-free game, unless of
course you find boredom enjoyable.  That said, I get just as frustrated
as anybody else when I slam headlong into a string of closely spaced
deaths, "tuning" your personal risk-reward ratio seems to be crucial
to making the game fun.

Unless you're dead-set on high efficiency soloing at prime-time that's
more than a bit of an exageration.


> not having to camp something for ridiculously unrealistic lengths of time,


Well, you don't actually "have" to camp anything.  My main is unlikely
ever to get his epic for instance, I simply refuse to get on the
Vox/Naggy tradmill, and should ding 53 in a week or two so people should
stop trying to convince me that's what I "have" to do.


> not having LD's always be a guarantee of big-time disaster,


I was shocked last night that I survived going LD right after DoT'ing
a blue con mob with my baby druid on FV.  There's no way my little
DoT could've done even a third of the mob's hits and I was already
down about 20% of my hits.  When I was able to reconnect I had about
the same hp total as when I went LD, but was down a couple bubbles
of mana, wondering if PC's will cast when LD?  (a few Careless
Lightnings would account for the dead mob and my spent mana)
