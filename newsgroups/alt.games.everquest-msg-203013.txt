That's a GeForce4, about on par with the best GF2s, better than the GF2 
MX series.

Only zone I suffer a noticable problem with still is the Bazaar, I use a 
GF4 ti-4200 with 128MB of DDR, 1GB 133MHz memory, 1.2GHz PIII processor.  
Upgrading from a GF2-MX400 with 64MB of memory to the GF4 ti-4200 made a 
very noticable differnece, adding the additional 256MB of memory to get 
to 1GB helped some, upgrading the processor from a 800MHz PIII to a 
1.2GHz made a noticable difference as well (the caveat here being that I 
had to replace the motherboard with one that could handle the newer PIII 
processors, and went from a crappy DFI MB to a Gigabyte MB which as a 
reputation of being a good MB).  I have always run with all models on, 
full clip plane, all options turned on, at 1280x1024.
