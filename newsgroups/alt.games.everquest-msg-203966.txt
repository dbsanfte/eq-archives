Well, some of us arnt in uber_guild_001 like you and have to *buy* their
equipment/spells, and its not like I sit in POK all day selling KEI.
Also some of us dont feel the need to feed our egos by bragging on this NG
about how twinked their alts are, or put others down who arnt as uber as
they are.

Have a nice day, come again
