   Exactly how I feel also.  In fact I killfiled a chronic top poster in this
group, Aruvqan, simply because of the "ease of reading" thing.  A  shame,
really, because otherwise I found their posts to be interesting and on topic. 
But if someone makes it hard for me to follow their post, I figure they really
don't want me reading it at all.
