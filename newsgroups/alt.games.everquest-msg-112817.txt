	Torpor.  I've done this with one of the guild's Shaman.

	The issue is not the capability to assemble a damage-dealing engine that
doesn't have to stop and recharge.  The issue is getting enough spawn so that
you're not forced to stop.

	If you are looking for a pickup group -- and I usually am -- you have to
go where the people are.

	Howling Stones is a) keyed and b) one-way, meaning c) it is BYOG.  You
need to get people who can get in and someone -- an evaccer -- who can get you
out again.  Furthermore, it has been "outed" on E'ci, and is quite popular.
One of the guild cliques will hit HS as its first-choice, and they always find
the place at least partially camped, and sometimes have had to turn around and
leave.

	Akheva is desolate on E'ci; I zoned in once to find myself the sole
occupant.  I've never seen more than two groups.  I agree that you can fit in
three tops (maybe four with slim pickings) before it gets nasty, but that just
contributes to its lack of popularity.  This one is BYOG for that reason.
