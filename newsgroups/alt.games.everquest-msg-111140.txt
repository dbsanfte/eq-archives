Accuracy, please. He was not grilled for being a Christian, he was 
grilled because his position on certain issues (which have nothing to do 
with Christianity, because lots of Christians don't share them) 
compromise his ability to do a good job as an Attorney General. As I said 
before, the people grilling him were also Christians (who just happen to 
disagree with him), so to claim that he was being grilled for being a 
Christian is noting less than profoundly disingenuous.
