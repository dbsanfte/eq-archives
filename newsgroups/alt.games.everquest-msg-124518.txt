EQLog 0.12 is now available at <http://www.cws.org/~pasketti/eqlog.html>.

The biggest change is the addition of the Combat reports that track
individual combat encounters, including the much-requested DPS.

The histograms are a lot more accessable, too.  There's a graph on the
report if there's histogram info available, just double-click to bring it
up.

Lots more stuff, listed below.

Changes:

Understands new spell resist message with 1 "!" instead of 2.

Understands spell damage messages that don't have a . in them.

Now tracks mob RAMPAGEs.

Now tracks critical blasts/exceptional heals in the "Spells" and "Spells
  by Level" reports.

Now tracks Beastlord warders automatically when they're summoned.

Fixed "Pet Damage Output" report.

Added global loot data file so that loot-by-zone data can be shared
  between characters.  It's a text file, so you can even share data with
  other players by appending their files onto your own.

TOO MANY COLUMNS!  Moved Critical Hits/Crippling Blow/Thunderous Kick/
  Deadly Strike damage from the various "Damage Output" reports to new
  "Special Damage" reports.

Paladin AA ability "Slay Undead" now tracked on "Special Damage" reports.

Added new "Combat" reports to track damage done and taken in individual
  combats, including DPS.

Removed the DPS histogram, since the new Combat reports give this
  information in a clearer and easier to use fashion.

Now processes merchant price quotes with no periods correctly.

Character options now automatically set to the current character.

The price on the "Merchant Items Bought" report will now reflect the
  best price given to that character rather than the price from the
  merchant data file.  The price on the "Merchant Inventory" report will
  still show the lower of the two.

Quantity bought/sold when buying/selling stacks is now more accurate.
  I hope.

Under some circumstances (mainly lag), mobs will continue to hit you
  after you die.  All mob damage taken after you die will now be 
  ignored.

Put a little graph icon on the report lines that have histogram info
  associated with them.  Right-click to see it.

Now understands new money messages with "and" in them.

Now processes "A group member has gone linkdead" message correctly.

Now prints date and time on the header of the printed reports.

Sorting report columns is MUCH faster on the large reports.

Squeezed a few hundred more lines/second out of it.
