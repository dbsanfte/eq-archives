Some of my most memorable moments involved gating mobs.  And mobs pathing
in screwy ways.  I'll never forgot that moment in charasis south wing when
the apparition pathed AWAY from us instead of straight towards us. We
froze for 5 seconds in horror, then cries of RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! could be
heard all the way to the north wing.  Thank goodness we were only a few
rooms from the zone-out and that there is no one to train in Charasis. :)

INcidentally, fear makes for some funny stories.  One I heard from rangers
glade I think it was...

...a fellow ranger was on a raid, I believe, and he was AE feared by the
boss mob straight into a crowd of slave mobs down a hall.  AS luck would
have it the boss mob then proceeded to summon him back.  He hoped in vain
that the boss mob would kill him, and thus spare the raid from having
hordes of slave mobs trained back on the raid, but no such luck...a cleric
healed him.

Enter the hordes of slaves, and the raid whiped.  Ironically, however, the
AE fear of the boss mob hit the slaves and aggroed the slaves.  The slaves
proceeded to attack the boss mob and kill him, and the adventure was a
success (still not sure if it was adventure or raid...I'm clueless about
LDON, so I don't know if you get points for raids, or adventures have boss
mobs with AE fear).

The best part was when the guy said at the end of his post "Soandso,
Rebel Leader and Emancipator of Slaves!"

Love that story. :)
