Odd though, I was PL'ing a buddy to low teens to catch up with the rest
of us who just rolled up new alts, and found that if he didn't
physically do any damage to a mob aside from the DS damage, he wouldn't
get any xp for it. He had to swing at each one in turn until he had hit
them all once before concentrating on any in particular. 

I never realized it worked that way.
