OK, in your little fantasy world a company like Sony doesn't know the 
demographics of its customer base.  In the real world, they know EXACTLY 
who the fuck their customers are.  You can't be this fucking dense.  
You're an ass, but you're not an idiot.

Read the fucking article.  I didn't say anything about virtually all 
guilds being run by women.  I said more likely.  Obviously if women are 
16% of the playerbase, they're not going to lead as many guilds as men.  
You have no experience in a guild, and from what I can tell, no experience 
even grouping in EQ.  You're like a Catholic priest talking about sex.

You know this from what study exactly?  I've read at least 3 different 
pieces which put the average playtime at about 20-hours a week.  It's a 
bit less than the amount of time the average American watches TV I'll 
wager.
