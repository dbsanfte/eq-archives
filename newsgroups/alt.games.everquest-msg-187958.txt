I just obtained the druid spell Circle of Stonebrunt. I am level 39.
1. What LOC will I port to in the map of Stonebrunt (Thanks EQAtlas)?
2. What is the zone LOC to go to Gulf of Gunthak from Stonebrunt. That's not
on the map (yet). It looks like there is an unused tunnel nub at pos 2000,
neg 4000. Is that what SOE used?
3. Does anyone know of a map, even crude, of GoGunthak?
4. Anyone been there and describe where you zone in from Stonebrunt?

Thanks.
