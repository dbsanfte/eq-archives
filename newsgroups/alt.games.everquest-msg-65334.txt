Sorry no.  Yes the underlying kernels are different but you can play the
same programs, same version on win2k as win98/me so from a software
standpoint (this arguement) they're part of the evolution.  If 95/98/me are
the same, why does the new version do Win2k and 98 but NOT 95.  Again it
doesn't really matter the whole point was that you can't expect software
manufacturers to cripple software to support win95, why not ask them to
support 3.11 and dos?
