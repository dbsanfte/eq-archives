I got a task from the Iksar in the NE corner of OT.  I had to run  all over Skyfire and
back to complete the task.  Had to stick my head into the VP entrance (Dry Sapara!), which
really freaked my stuff to be that close to a dragon, all by meself.  Yes, I know he cons
indiff - but when I first saw him you better believe I grabbed my GVD ;->

There are apparently several more steps in this task, which I have not yet completed.
Wonder what else is in store.

Best regards,
