I have 9 lvl 61/62 spells.  I don't have Truespirit yet but I don't plan on
dinging lvl 61 just yet and I don't want to buy it cause my luck I'll
probably
win it in a parch the day after.  I also had 4 doubles of some of those 9
that I have but traded 2 to my guild for Avatar and the other two will go to
the guild for Torpor as soon as they find it on one of the multiple spell
mules. :/
