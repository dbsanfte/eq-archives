Ok. Found one (multiple) you may want to know about in case you're
working on the Thurg shawl quests, Phenocryst (sp?) or any Thurg quests.

Having acquired all the components needed for the 3rd Coldain prayer
shawl, I went and did all the BS tradeskill stuff yesterday. Smithed my
way up a bit and made a fillet knife. Did pottery (got up to 60!) and
made a baking sheet and a pot. Went and did bear meat fillets and got my
baking up to 143 to trivial all the shawl combines. Hunted up some snake
eggs for the dough for one part, and then happily went to talk to the
quest mob. 

Loremaster Borannin in the Thurg temple would respond to a hail with the
"Have a seat and listen to the historian..." line, but would respond to
NONE of the other text to get me the seal to start the 3rd shawl quest.
He also would not respond to "I will do a service for the crown" or
whatever it is for the first shawl. 

Sucks, but on the advice of James and others I had already also started
gathering up all the ground spawn items for the Phenocryst Focus quest,
as has Tarre, so she popped down into the Thurg mines to talk to Normon
Stonetooth. He also responded to hails, but would NOT respond to any
other key words, phrases etc. so the quest could not be started.

I petitioned and wound up talking to a SWAT Team GM by some act of the
gods. He checked out the quest mobs and said they still worked for
turn-ins if you already had the stuff, but the text portion was broken.
I would just have to wait until it's fixed.

/em sighs, clearly disappointed.

I went back to quadding, but at least I have all the stuff for when it
gets fixed. Just figured I'd save some of you some time if you're
working on these quests. I suspect that all the Thurg quest mobs are
doing this, though I can't confirm that.
