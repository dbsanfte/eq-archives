They're semi-dead as a class NOW.  At the high-end, anyway.  Most raid-level
encounters really only need ONE enchanter.  There's no crowd control to do,
so all we do is clarity/haste/grm.

Dire Charm has a level limit of 46.  It's really not as useful as you might
think, since very few high-end zones have mobs that can be Dire Charmed in
them.  Kael is the only raid-level zone where DC can really be said to be
useful.
