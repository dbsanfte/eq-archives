hehehe reminds me of an old Guild I was in and two of the leaders were
... well love mates... and apparently they were cybering....  and all
we get in Guild Chat is  " ooohh your all wet".    and then dead
silence in the Guild.... the one who sent the message... shortly
thereafter put in guild...  " /blush  we wer  um.... swimming... yeah
thats it... swimming"

and my most favorite mistell.....   I was sending a nasty message
(read sexual) to the my wife (my RL wife who is in the same room as me
but its funny to see her visible response to some of my comments).
and I did it in group.... Oh how I turned several shades of red... and
of course one in group had to respond..   " er... I dont swing like
that"
