LDoN is likely to be good, they will however most likely want you
doing CC, if they dont have a chanter.

but, xp is xp.

DSP still has some ok spots, once you hit 46 of course theres PoD
which will be excellent

CHA doesnt seem to effect missed notes much for me, at 65, Ive not
quite got to the IM etc AAs but, Ive maxed CHA before, and still
missed tons, it just seems to be random. I think Dex allows normal
casters to continue if interrupted more, but, nothing seems to make a
blind bit of difference for me.
