EQ Weapons and Armor database has monk hands listed as a weapon.
Unfortunatly, they're listed under one hand blunt.  

FYI, the break down is:

Level 1 to 4:		4/36
Level 5 to 9:		5/36
Level 10 to 14:		6/36
Level 15 to 19:		7/36
Level 20 to 24:		8/36
Level 25 to 29:		9/35
Level 30 to 34:		10/34
Level 35 to 39:		11/33
Level 40 to 44:		12/32
Level 45 to 49:		13/31
Level 50 to 54:		14/30
Level 55 to 59:		14/29
Level 60:		14/28
