Ok race aside, which class is better Warrior or Beserker?

Why did you (if you did) create a whole new character to be a
Beserker?

As far as I can tell, (and I haven't created one yet) a beserker is a
warrior who can only use 2hs weapons.  For this penalty they also get
some special skill which allows them to increase the hits per second.
(Which is nice cuz 2hs weapons have always had a very slow hit rate at
least the ones I have used).

Also on a side, note, which race will tend to make the best Beserker?
I was hoping that halfings could become beserkers cuz I kinda like to
play them and they make awesome warriors, but I can't seem to see the
options.

Another question, I realize this is a new class, but has anyone
written a guide to Berserkers, from creation on out?

Thanks in advance for the replies.
