<sigh> don't we know it I was in oasis medding at docks the other day and
shouted "sowing and buffing for donation to the scimitar fund lol" had one
or 2 come up got sow and gave me various bits of money (mostly trying to get
rid of weight I think LOL) then this ranger comes up and say can I have heal
and sow plz so heals him back to full and sows him he runs off without so
much as a ty. sits back down and 2 minutes later he comes up with below half
life (didn't even bother to bind wound himself) and says "heal again"
needless to say he didn't get one and I think I am on his jerk list now LOL.
