Not as of last night. At least not in DL. Guildie got popped up to the
Nexus from DL within thirty seconds of landing, having been ported
there, because he didn't flee the area fast enough.  Annoying, but not
lethal. But most certainly not fixed.

Also, has anyone seen any progress on fixing the announcing in Nexus
yet? I wound up in Tox this weekend with my warrior when I was trying to
get to GD. Not only were there not "public annoncements", but that time
I never even saw the "The Vellius Spires begin to cast a spell" message.
Just *poof*. "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT. You have entered Tox Forrest."

Grrrrrrrrrrr.
