Others have answered your questions,so let me ask,why does a player
choose EQ1 nowadays as its first MMORPG,when there is a much easier
accessible game for "Newbies"?
Before you invest money in EQ expansions,I would give WoW a try,
although its more *boys* society than EQ,judging from the WoW 
message boards and some very limited in game experience.
(I think WoW players are a little schizophrenic,you should see all the
"whines" from players on pvp servers getting killed :p)

Hm,the society,I would guess largely male,but boys I am not so sure,my
impression is the player base is 20+ years old.
