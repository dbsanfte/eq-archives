Tsk. You should have :) Pottery goes up a skill level *every second 
attempt*.  Doesn't seem to matter what you're doing.  I followed this

http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_pottery2.htm

(and *did* fire the stuff)

And it's the only skill I've managed to get above 100 so far.

Heck, it's the only skill (besides fletching) I've managed to get past 
31 ;)
