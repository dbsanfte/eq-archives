That's one of the things about EC that Freeman will miss when he no longer
barters there.  I imagine Slate will be happier without all the high level
merchants clogging up his tunnel.  Noisy lot, they were.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
