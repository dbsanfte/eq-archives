thanks to all who gave me info regarding how long my corpse would be
there...went back to kithicor, got some help from an iskar who'd seen my
body, and all is well again.  i've sucked a friend into playing EQ...but
he's already getting a little frustrated with how easy it is to die
initially.  he's in qeynos...i'm bound to west freeport.  any suggestions on
my level 7 dwarfish butt can help him get cross continent?
