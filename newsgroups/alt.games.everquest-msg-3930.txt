I understand the mechanics of the inspect and why it is allowed.  But, to
inspect someone IS rude because it's none of your business what I have.  Do
you peek into peoples' windows simply because they are see through and you
wanna see what someone has in their house?  Not only is that illegal, but
that's morally reprehensible.  If you want to know what I have, do the right
thing and ask.  I have never told someone that they could not inspect me, if
they asked first.  As far as having the inspect message off, yes, they are
still being rude if they inspect me, but ostrich syndrome is a wonderful
thing.
