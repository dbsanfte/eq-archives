You're overly optimistic.  If he's been in 20 groups then he's surely
been told to assist (more than once).  Any assumption beyond that it
is pure speculation, especially if he's under 50.  The lower level
dungeons are set up to be doable by newbies (i.e. L30s in gear only
a little better than L50s had when Kunark opened), they're not even
slightly challenging for veterans or twinks.
