A funny thing happened to me in the office yesterday..
I was beating on sarnaks in the fort in Ill Omen trying to find a bracer of
the hidden and/or earring of station when I happened upon another Sarnak
Revenant and his pet.
I started to put the beat down on it and predictably, it's pet took offense.
Now, when I'm in there I like to have an added recruit or two 'cos it stops
the casters from running all over the castle when they get to run mode.
So, I killed the revenant and hit the FD key expecting the pet to go *poof*
but it didn't.
It seemed to be so incensed at losing his master that he turned on the 2
recruits who were helping the Revenant. Eventually they killed the skinny
bugger so I put it down to a bug or glitch.
Then it happenend again on the very next Revenant, so I was wondering what
had happened. Maybe it was casting an AoE fear or something (or trying to)
and aggroed them. I must have hit it for around 100 damage in riposte so I
did do damage to it but I thought this was rather weird - if not amusing.
Any thoughts?
