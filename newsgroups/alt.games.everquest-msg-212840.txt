I'm pretty sure that the is no Placeholder for the mammoths, or at
least for the two mammoths at the north end of the zone. From what I
could tell last time I hunted there (about a year ago with a ranger),
a new mammoth was guaranteed to pop as soon as I killed the last one.
Spawn point seemed to be random but always reasonably close to the Y
in the river. 

You're right about the money though, my ranger spent lvl 30 there and
got about 1000p.
