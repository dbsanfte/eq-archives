Hell, I have fun and all in RL. Hold a good job as well. I was not so much
pointing out inhibitions about confessing game time, so much as the humorous
(at least to me) mix up between RL "partying" and MUD/RPG "partying". I
wholeheartedly admit however that Evercrack is very addictive and easy to
binge on (especially during a weekend). I haven't even joined a guild yet.

I don't really even consider EQ all the shameful a habit. Over the years
I've gone through addictions to Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon, paper &
pencil RPGs, murder mystery games (Baker Street etc), and now EQ... And the
one I'd admit to most openly would probably be EQ.
