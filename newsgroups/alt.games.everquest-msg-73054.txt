Uh did you ever stop and think how much time and money that person
put into the site and information on it?

Did you also stop and think that the memory upgrade was necessary
for her to have in order to go to Luclin to get all the info for the site?

Did you happen to know that the Denmother personally verifies all the
vendor locations and recipes for the site?

I doubt the few donations that she got even covered 1% of the money
she spent on bandwidth BEFORE ever asking for donations.

How much is your time worth?

THINK before you acuse someone of wrong doing.
