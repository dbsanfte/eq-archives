> The FBI didn't start that fire --

    Unfortunately the FBI went out of its way to muddy this particular
situation. It was 8-9 years after the fact that they
suddenly remebered that they might have had some of the kinds of tear gas
grenades that start fires there after all. Ooops.
While it certainly does not begin to show that they started the fire, the
confidence that they did not waned somewhat.
