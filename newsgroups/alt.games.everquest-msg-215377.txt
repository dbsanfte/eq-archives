More info please :)  How hard did the mobs hit?  How many HP did they
have?  I won't ask about levels, because they were all DB to you, I'd
wager.

Looks like you had a level 65 adventure - if so that argues for 
average levels.

I always get pretty accurate max hit numbers because I get hit
when I sit sometimes - full hits BLEAH.  Also Black steel gives
me a pretty good idea of mob HP.
