Actually, he said he was a bard.   It's not a bad idea to train skills
like defense up outside a group, and he's just looking for a mob to
use that is relatively safe.   A very light blue to a 39 that hits fast
but not hard seems to be the ideal choice, but I can't think of one.
The crazed goblins in Butcherblock might still be blue at that level,
but I don't know.   If so, that's a great spot to solo safely.
