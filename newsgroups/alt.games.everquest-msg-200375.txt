True on the Grey, but I've never understood the "Kedge isn't worth it"
point of view.  I loved that place when I was younger.  Of course, I
had maxed swimming and an EB item, but the experience there rocked
because of all the bonuses.  Still, the difficulty in reaching it
COULD be considered a major inconvenience; however, it doesn't seem to
stop people from going to Unrest......hmmmmm....oh, well, just
IMO...:)
