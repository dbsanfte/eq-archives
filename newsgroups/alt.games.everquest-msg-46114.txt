Your friend has 2 options with the trilogy: (one code/CD key for the whole
package btw)

1.)  Upgrade his existing base account for Velious/Kunark access - Trilogy
CD key used up.

2.)  Start an entirely *new* full access (trilogy) account with I *think* 90
days free play time. Trilogy CD key used up.

These two options are exactly what you are asked when you go to enable the
Trilogy.
