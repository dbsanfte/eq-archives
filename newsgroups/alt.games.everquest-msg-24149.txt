Wuoshi isn't so horribly deadly.  She was trained to Kael and my brother's
cleric was still KOS to her (level 55 at the time, probably).  She was out
of melee range (no idea if that'd make a difference) but her spell only did
about 700 damage.  She did root him, and I was ready to just let him die and
then realized that hell, I had time to cast a heal.  I further had time for
my enchanter (not KOS) to sit down, mem Pillage Enchantment, stand up,
un-root him, and both of us make a bee-line to the zone line (about 10').

She apparently rooted him right as he was zoning, because he was rooted on
the Kael side next to a giant that was just trained over there.  I don't
know where my enchanter was (he may have dropped...<sarcasm> what a shocker
in Velious, huh </sarcasm> ) but he took about a minute's worth of beating
'til a magician who wanted a rez was finally convinced to cast Cancel Magic
on him again.  By then Wuoshi was gone <whew, he was OOM by then>.

Oh, my point was that I've heard that if even a druid just touches the
outside of her aggro range runs like hell, they should be able to survive
the encounter, barring added critters, of course.
