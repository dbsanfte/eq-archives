I've made mention of this continuously, and have on occaision found someone who
would test it, only to discover in a duo or even trio that the autosplit looter
tends to only come out slightly ahead.  But just recently in OT, I've noted
that the mobs have up to 4pp each, and of course this means in a group of 6 we
NEVER get a split of pp, in fact its usually a couple copper and maybe a
silver, yet I know full well that the mobs we are killing drop an average of
2pp each.  Very funny, every time I see the split message for a silver piece it
reminds me  I really need to make a point of doing some looting.  I don't
bother explaining how broke Autosplit is anymore though, been thru that
discussion Hrair times.  Hrair Hrair times.
