Just pray that they don't decide to make life easier for Bards, like
they did for the pet classes recently.  It used to be that Mages who
used their pets well in groups were "the few, the proud".  Now any
moron in the game can play a Mage without too much risk of getting
their group wiped due to a moments inattentiveness.  If they somehow
managed to make Bards easy to play the d00ds would discover them and
exploit them all to hell and it wouldn't be long before they brought
out that industrial strength nerfbat they've been keeping locked in
a closet for just such a special occasion.  Or at least that's my
opinion.
