The skill would be in _avoiding_ the CR.  That aside, I've been on
a few challenging CRs that turned out to be a lot of fun.  The
boring part is waiting out rez effects and rebuffing after you get
all the corpses and the Cleric or Paladin together in some safe
spot (and even then there are sometimes roamers making things
exciting, depending on where you wiped).

Some places that's true.  For those you're gonna need the dragger or
summoner option.  Personally, I don't see it as a bad thing that there
are such places in the game.  The more variety the better.  Especially
if the designers manage a decent risk vs. reward arrangement.

Some of the best fun I've had in EQ involved recovering from wipes,
or getting to and killing a mob after a wipe or two on the way.
Challenge is a good thing, keeps the game interesting.  The most
boring thing I've ever done was grouping in OT or DL to kill mob
after mob after mob with no risk, just grinding as fast as possible
to get xp.  The most fun is dungeon crawling when you know that a
wipe will put a real kink in your plans.  The auto-reset of the PoP
graveyards feels like a video game, not an adventure game.
