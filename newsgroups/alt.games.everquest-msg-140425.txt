errr,  I guess your ignorance is more vast than I imagined.  See when
you replied to my post I thought  you were replying to my post, but it
seems that you tagged your text onto my end of the thread but weren't
really addressing what I had said at all.  I made no mention of mana
caps so all your efforts to restate all the babble about what some high
end uber twink might end up with really was just babble.  In my mistaken
belief I thought your accusation that I was jealous was based on what I
had actually said.  In that way my response to you was spot on.  You are
ignorant of exactly how FoH, and their "special" relationship with the
developers damaged the game and it shows.  I am disappointed, disgusted
and dismayed over their impact on the game, but to be jealous of that
which I find a detriment to a game I enjoy would be downright silly.
