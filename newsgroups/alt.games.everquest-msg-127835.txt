Don't be silly.

MapX provides no information that is not available to all players
anyway.  It is incorrect to call this "extra information".  It 
just displays it more accurately, and more quickly, than you 
could do it by hand.

ShowEQ, on the other hand, provides many kinds of information
that is *not* available to players.  It's "peeking behind the
curtain".  Among other things, it allows non-Tracking classes
to not only Track every mob in the zone, but to do it *better*
than any Ranger can.

To say that there is "absolutely zero difference" is ridiculous.

Your objection to MapX (i.e., that it does more accurately
and quickly that which any player could do manually) would also
be an argument against using a kitchen timer to predict the
next spawn time (since you couldn't do it nearly as accurately
if you were estimating the elapsed time mentally -- or
mentally calculating an elapsed time by frequently doing a /time),
or using a calculator for various game purposes, or using
computer printouts of maps (instead of personally mapping each
zone on a blank piece of paper) or quest information (instead
of scribing handwritten notes of all quest text).  And so on.

Do you consider those exploits as well?
