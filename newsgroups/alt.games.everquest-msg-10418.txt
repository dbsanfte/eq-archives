I went back and read the full post that Taras Bulbas wrote.

Bulbas, you were picked on a LOT as a child, weren't you?  And it's still
happening, right?

I've never met someone who takes as much offense at anything said as you.
No one I know has ever made as many excuses for people as you do.

So just change your name...in the US that's easy...I don't know how it is in
AU, but I'm sure that'll cut down on probably 90% of the harassment you must
receive on a daily basis.
