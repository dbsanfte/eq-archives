He's in a LDON.  What does he need to run fast for again?  Even
pulling, what's the worst that will happen?  Get hit for a few hundred
points because he can't run as fast while pulling the mobs 20 feet to
the group?  Just seems like overkill, 95% of the time.  I never take a
SoW/SoE in to a LDON if I am anywhere near 15 buffs.  As far as I can
tell, you will only want it when doing a hard and when you don't have
run 3.  How often does that happen?

BTW some other things to consider that Im not sure anyone mentioned:

-You may be able to get away without regen spells.  These usually have
a symbol of three blue hearts on top of each other, kinda looks like a
cloud.  (Shaman, Druid, BL, Ranger spells)
-Dexterity buffs?  Does it actually affect bard songs?  If you dont
need it, click off any picture that shows a dagger balanced on a
fingertip.  Other buffs provide dex, but may have other positive
benefits.  (Shaman and BL spell line)
-Most Str buffs except Diaku if you do need dex.  (Cast by Shaman,
Druids, Ranger, BLs)
-Blessing or Aura of Reverence.  I assume spell haste will not help
bards.  (Cast by clerics.)
-Levitation spells.  If you have a Necro in the group, chances are you
will get the spell Dead Man Floating.  It buffs your poison resists
(whoopie, might resist a trap that would have done almost nothing to
you anyway) and gives you enduring breath (dont need) along with
levitate.  Click it off.
-Acumen.  Shaman, especially those new to the higher levels, seem to
cast this all the time for no apparent reason.  It is a friggen sight
buff.  Almost no one needs it.  But they cast it anyway.
-Enchanter illusions.  Only a few are worth having and aside from
buffing your dexterity and attack, none of them would have any
positive effect for you.  Once again, I dont know how important Dex is
to Bards.

Oh and tell that Druid to stop being lazy and cast the DS on himself
and then the tank.  No one else wants it.
