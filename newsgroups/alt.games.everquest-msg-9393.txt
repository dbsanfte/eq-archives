I think a few people have missed the point of this post - that a mage is 
the perfect partner for a paladin, but everyone is talking about who is the 
best partner for a mage.  I don't know the answer to this question, but I 
have been regularly partnering with a paladin of late and I must say that 
it's a most harmonious partnership.  This is probably more a function of 
the player than the class. Having said this, partnering with a tank who can 
root mobs and heal herself, is great.
