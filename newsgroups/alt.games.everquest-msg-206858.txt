I bet you'd have shaved 80% of the time off your RZtW attempts if you guys
were more used to learning your own strats (rejusting and refining) than
just picking up CiH's and Safehouses strats, and making (often unexplained)
strats try to work for you.

It was quite clear (for me to see), guilds who've been devising their own
strats since Kunark and Velious had a much easier time progressing on the
tough PoP fights than guilds who "borrowed" strats for anything tough that
ever came ahead of them.

Me personally - I take much more pleasure in dieing to a mob (however many
times), working on and refining a strat, and finally overcoming said beast,
than to have the strat spoon-fed to me, and to kill the mob first time.
