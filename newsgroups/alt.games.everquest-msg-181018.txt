There are tips and tricks to avoid or limit taking a beating from behind..
but also, a SK doesn't have defensive skills from behind either.  I don't
necessarily agree with the AC comment either.

There are many different options.   Make some javelines (smithing), make
some  darts (fletching), get a bio orb.

I beat my guildie SK's for AC and HP.  Maybe all our SK's are slackers on
raids?  But All/All gear is making the AC argument dissapear (my AC is upto
1500 or so as a monk, I don't have the iksar Ac bonus, nor am I the best
geared monk on the server by far)

They also get a second version at level 60, which can be used in conjunction
with FD.
They can get mana free right click FD (kunark pants?)

/disc stonestance and mend changes all that, if the SK had an advantage to
start with

Raid level I would say monk by far.  Exp groups.. its debatable and depends
