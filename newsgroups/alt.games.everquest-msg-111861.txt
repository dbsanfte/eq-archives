Not new, always been there.  The sea lions/manatees are non-KoS.  But 
there is a moktor that pats through those tunnels, and yes, right over the 
so called safespot.  The sealions/manatees *will* assist on 
moktors/bulthars.  

For what it's worth, I've only ever seen one person get jumped zoning in 
at the succor spot, and they were able to get to the zone out with no 
problem.  Of course, they had done it before, and new exactly what they 
were doing.

Personally I almost always *run* through.  That's really not any safer 
though.
