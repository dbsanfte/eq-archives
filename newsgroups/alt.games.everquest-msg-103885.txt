It's almost always safe in SG if you're not so stupid as to go AFK during
the cast and you know which way to run.  I saw your later post and that
druid was just unlucky...shit happens, it doesn't necessarily mean anything

zoning into DL from BW, but that's the same thing...just a "shit happens"
deal.
