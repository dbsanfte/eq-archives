I hope someone doesn't petition your Character DT by reporting it as a
variant of a wanted terrorist's name " Hasan Izz-Al Din"
Let me show you how it can happen.

Kahir or Al-Kahir is a old Islamic name which translates to "Hasan" in
modern times, I'm assuming you know this since you named your
character this. The name goes as far back as the great al-Kahir
bi-Ahkami'l or Hasan bin Muhammad.

If I didn't want to confuse the GM with more details, like the last
name of Rhom, which I could say was just another way of spelling
"roam" so in fact its Hasan Roams = Terrorist roams. And in this day
and age I don't think it would take 3 months to change more like in 3
hours.

Yeah, it may be a stretch but what do GM's know about names anyway
right.
