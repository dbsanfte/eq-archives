The biggest limitation to my testing is that I am working with one
computer and one account.  Somehow I doubt I'll have much luck
talking a higher level cleric and/or shaman into enduring a few hours
of utter boredom to facilitate my tests.  I can do a few things tho,
and I'll post the results as I get them.  It might actually be fun
to see how a 52 Paladin fares mostly naked against Hill Giants.
