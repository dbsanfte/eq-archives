Except that the invserse of exponential growth (logarithmical) is very
little growth at all. Not much out there is slower than logarithmical
growth :)

As a mathematical aside. Trains can't grow exponetially. (Perhaps if
social aggro chained it could. At best it grows geometrically,
although its linear in most cases.
