Actually, very little of it was in the WTC complex.  The vast majority
is in 60 Hudson several blocks north of the WTC complex, or in 111 8th
Avenue, almost two miles north.  Other than the West Street central
office, almost all network problems were a result of power being cut
below 14th Street for the rescue and firefighting efforts.  I have
verified that I do not have any appreciable packetloss doing anything
other than playing EQ.  (I am very aware of the telco infrastructure
in Lower Manhattan, I've spent most of the past 7 years working with
it in one way or another.)  The ongoing power issues at 25 Broadway
have been alleviated with the installation of an additional generator
until to replace the one that failed yesterday.
