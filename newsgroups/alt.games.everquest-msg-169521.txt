Yes, but there are accepted accent or dialect expressing misspellings
without actually making spelling mistakes. Roleplaying is no excuse
for just being lazy. 

For example, your ogre saying "u" instead of "you" is just being lazy
and using "kewl dewd" speak. If it SOUNDS like "you" already, why are
you misspelling it? The ogre is more apt to use english INCORRECTLY
rather than misspelling. Since the ogre in game is supposedly
"talking", how would you SEE the misspelling? The ogre might say:

"Me am trying to kill critters."

but not,

"Mi ame tryoing too kil criters"

They sound the same, so why misspell?

Rhett Butler's "Suh" is another good example. It tells us he is saying
"Sir," but with an accent. If you spelled it "siir", then we just
think its a mistake.
