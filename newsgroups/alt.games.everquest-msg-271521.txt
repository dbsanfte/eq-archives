All the "village" rooms look the same for each city. Freeport's look
different from Qeynos', though.

If you "tour" a house, you see it in only the basic wall/floor
dressing. You have to pay to upgrade it, and the price of that can get
heavy. Unfortunately, there's no way to just preview the upgrades. You
have to actually buy and apply to see what they look like.

>Is it possible to stick your head in a room and look around? 

Right click the door, pick "visit". You can enter any rooms that are
listed. (If they're listed as "friends" access, you can even rearrange
their furniture. ;) ) ( This is also recommended for shopping to avoid
paying the broker fee, too. Use the broker to find out who's selling
what where, then actually go to the room and visit them to buy
directly ) This way you can get a look around what they have. Best to
only visit people you're shopping from, though. Generally rude just to
barge into someone's home.

Not quite clear on the question here. Do you mean buying a room, then
giving it up to go back to your old one? You have to relinquish
ownership of your old room to buy a new one (collect all the items
fromt he room first, though). You still lose the purchase fee, even if
you relinquish the new room right away. Not a good way to just
"preview" a room. Click the door of any room/house and click "tour"
for a look around at what's out there. Unfortunately, I don't think
you can see wall/flooring options this way, though.
