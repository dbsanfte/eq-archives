Why do people complain about random drops not happening for them.  Random
means that it is possible that you'll never get it, while the next guy
could get 100 in a row.  You and others petitioned about this?  Don't you
think the GMs have better things to do than listen to you complain about
your bad luck?  It sometimes takes hours for a GM to respond to a
petition, the time to resolution would be decreased if all these pointless
complaint petitions were kept to a minimum.  Especially when a bunch of
different people petition about the same problem because they think it
adds more weight to their argument.
