Refresh rate or frame rate? Refresh rate is usually
limited by your monitor. Frame rate on the other hand
is limited mainly by a combination of CPU and video
card. Neither is limited by the OS. Q3 actually runs
a little faster in 2000 than ME, some 3d engines may
be a little slower but not enough to make a difference.
FWIW I run EQ at 1280 x 1024 @85hz refresh rate, clipping
plane maxed, particles on HUD mode bla bla bla. It never
goes below 40 fps and usually stays above 70. These numbers
are estimates but after 5yrs installing and tweaking
hardware I know that above 70fps is where frame rates start
looking silky smooth to me.
