	Hi all...

My nieces boyfriend gave me EQ;Ruins of Kunark because he thought I'd
like it.  It is original game, not a copy.  I guess he had it for
awhile and played it because he really said I'd like it.  Anyway, I go
through the reg, create station name, etc... then am requred to enter
Acct key...no problem, it's right on the case but I get a message
saying game is already tied to a station account.  I s this because he
played it prior to giving it to me?  He says he hasn't used it for at
least six months.  How do I start to play?  I'm ready to try and the
monthly fee is not a problem, so how can I get this thing up and
running?

PS...I have already gone through hours of updates, I'm hoping all that
time was not wasted.  Thanks for any help.
