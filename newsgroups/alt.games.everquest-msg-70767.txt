Yes, Full neutral is the best and really only good choice. Everyone
else pays for differing alignments more than they get bonuses or they
have people they can't group with at all. Neutral has it the same way
as on the regular EQ server, can group with anyone and gets no bonus
or minus to xp. 

My shaman was orderly neutral I think to start and at 10 I changed it
to Neutral.
