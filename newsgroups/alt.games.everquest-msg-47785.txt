Not as well as a Ranger.

Wizard would be better for translocate, and they have the advantage of
being able to put out more damage.

Rangers can do this as well as druids.

Let me reiterate, I'm not saying that druids suck, they don't.  My
main is a druid.  I love the class, mainly because we can do a little
bit of just about anything that any of the other classes can.  But we
can't heal as well as a cleric.  We can't buff as well as a shaman.
We can't put out as much damage as a wizard or mage.  We don't DoT as
well as a necro.  We don't even TP better than wizards any more. 

My point is that if you have an open slot in a raid, while there's no
reason NOT to put a druid there, there isn't really an overpowering
reason TO put a druid in that slot either.
