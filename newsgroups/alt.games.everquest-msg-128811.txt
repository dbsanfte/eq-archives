You people should read the original post: I'm not agnostic, I'm not an
enchanter, necro, druid, ar anything else - I'm a (now lvl 25) magician. So
I guess I'll just answer my own question:

> Is there any way for me to complete this quest?

The answer is NO.


> Im a lvl 23 Mag and have completed everything needed to get the stein of
> maggok - except actually getting the stein. I have the book to turn in to
> the bartender in the city of Oggok, but Im a high elf and not welcome
there.
