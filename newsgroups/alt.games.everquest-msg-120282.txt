Never killed a giant or coldain.  Got 8 coldain heads, turned them
in at the recruiter in Kael.  Now I'm Dubious to both Storm
and Frost giant factions, and still  only Dubious to Coldain.

With a song, I"m indifferent to any one of the above.

Haven't run off to check dragons yet, but AFAIK you
start KOS to them and turning in the heads just made
things worse.  Is there any way to increase COV faction
while not hurting giants faction?

What about body dragging, is KD one of the zones where
dragging makes you KOS?  Can I drag while invis as long
as I avoid the See Invis giants?  I specifically checked the
See Invis guys and they are dubious while invis.

Although there's little call for it, can I drag bodies in Thurgadin?
Visible or Invisible?  Any See Invis mobs in Thurg or Icewell
to watch out for?
