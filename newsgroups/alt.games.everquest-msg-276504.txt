Anyone taking bets?  Given their track record of "balancing" to prevent it
being too easy for the best-equipped max-AA enchanters, I predict:  
 - Nerf in all pre-OoW zones where charming was viable.  Massive DPS reduction
     with a very very minor reduction in risk (because former pets will no
     longer be hasted).  Massive nerf in those few places where you can today
     have a high-risk, high-reward pet.  In 2 or 3 zones, this nerf may be
     justified, but to call it an overall improvement is simply wrong.
 - No significant change in OoW and later zones where charming currently is
     vaguely viable.  They will remove the ability to add reward and risk by
     removing the question of whether to haste the pet, and they'll fix DPS at
     a laughable amount.  They'll claim it's equal to a rogue, but they'll
     remain woefully incorrect.
 - Appearance of change, but no actual change in currently-uncharmable areas.
     They'll say it's an improvement because charm kinda works there, but
     nobody wil use it.

Let's not forget the absolute LACK of mention of non-charm enchanter roles.
Crowd control seems as unnecessary as ever in DoN.  Chanty slow drops from an
arguable second place to a clear third as beasties get an improvement.  No
comment about our silly dot and debuff lines.  NO UMBRA UPGRADE ??!?!!

Note that a few other classes got pretty ho-hum promises, it's not just
enchanters.  I wonder how Shamen will like being told that slowing is part
of their healing power and they shouldn't be able to use both...

Mostly what I'm missing is an actual statement of expected roles and defining
characteristics of each class.  A list of changes without any indication of
what SoE thinks the changes are intended to add up to is pretty weak.
