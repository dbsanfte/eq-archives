Well it has (thinking off my head) 13 int and 60mana on it, so Id use it
whether it proc'd or not

Also, KEI isn't something thats exclusively available to higher level people
(for their twinks).  I get it when a guildie chanter is passing through my
zone or needs a ride, but I also go to nexus and pay one of the many KEI'ing
chanters there just like anybody else does...  and adding KEI to the
equation changes the need to med for maximum effectiveness
