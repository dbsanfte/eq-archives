I have not experienced different success rates on items with the same
trivial level that I have ever noticed.  Not on any consistant basis anyway.
As for items that don't trivial at 250, the differing success rates on those
is easily explained by them having different trivial levels, suchs as 260 vs
270.  I have no idea how accurate the information is on eqtraders, but, it
does claim to have projected trivial levels for the JC items over 250, which
I have to assume were extrapolated from success rates.  The alternative is
that someone just made wild assed guesses at them, which is quite possible
as well.
