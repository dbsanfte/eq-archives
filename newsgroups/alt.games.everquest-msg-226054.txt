The shaman in our group just dinged 58 shortly into our first dungeon, but
didn't bring Tigir's with him to see how it works on multiples.  Is this an
effective spell or are resists too high?  I understand that it's supposed to
have hate reduction as part of the spell's effects - does the Shaman still
get a lot of aggro?
