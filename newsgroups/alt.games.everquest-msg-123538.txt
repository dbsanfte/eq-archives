Good websights have alot of info such as http://eq.castersrealm.com,
http://www.everlore.com  http://everquest.allakhazam.com.

Bare bones you need the original Everquest. 9.99 for it and one month to try
it before your credit card starts getting charged. If your computer meets
the specs this would be easiest way to try Everquest. Sign up, play for a
bit, and if ya like it keep playing. if you DON'T like it, then cancel your
account and your out ten bucks. not a really big deal for most ppl.

First there is Everquest: Original. It all starts somewhere :)
There are currently 3 expansions for Everquest (Kunark, Velious, and
Luclin).
If you can find Kunark, it normally ships WITH Everquest: Original. MEANING
you get Everquest with the expansion :) (but if you get into the game,
Velious is almost IMPOSSIBLE to find by it self so you'll probably end up
buying...)
You can buy the Trilogy (Everquest, Kunark, and Velious) for 29.99 and get
those three together. I would suggest this if your serious about everquest.
Easy to find.
Luclin is sold by itself (not a 'all in one' version with all 4 version
together yet) You do NOT need to have Kunark/Velious to use luclin but it's
suggested. Luclin is one of the 'Value adds' in that it has a tun of stuff
that is extreamly usefull but not neccissary to play eq.

Computer Spec Wise:

Minimum System Requirements:

Windows� 98/00/XP
Pentium� II 400
128 MB RAM
Direct3D accelerator card with 16 MB video
DirectX 8.1 compatible sound card
56k + Internet connection
2X speed CD-ROM
600 MB +

Recommended:

Pentium� II 500 or greater
256 MB RAM
Direct3D accelerator card with 32 MB video RAM
4X speed CD-ROM

With upgrades (ESPCECIALLY Luclin) it's highly recomended that you have the
fastest computer possible, and go above and beyond the 'min' or even
'recommended' specs. I run on a so so 750amd computer and do fine. But there
are alot of 'Spiffy' options I have turned off to do so though.

I would honestly suggest you find a friend who plays and ask him questions
about the game. And maybe ask him if you can either watch him play as he
runs around Norrath, or have him assist you on your first journey into
Everquest. It's how I got started and it saved alot of those 'How do I do
this?' or 'wtf do I do?' headaches. someone to tell you what to do at first
is SO much better than learning as you go (And even with friend there is SO
much you still have to learn :)

And if you have a friend who shows you around you can also get that friend
to help you out in game and you know someone who can 'hook you up' with good
items and such :) If you play you will learn what twink means :)

Good luck and hope you enjoy EQ.
