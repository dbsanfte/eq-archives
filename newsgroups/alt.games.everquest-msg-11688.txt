Killing sarnaks and goblins. will help you with the normal guards, and
turning in bone chips to the one guard in the field of bone will help you
with the SK guards.   Its a long process, I im indifferent to the guards, but
still scowling to the SKs.  I hear it in the line of 3000-5000 bone chips,
and some religions will never get out of scowling.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no
character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of
your walks."
