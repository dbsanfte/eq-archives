You don't have enough points to keep more than one skill maxxed, and if 
that one skill is your primary weapon skill, the one you plan to use the 
most, it strikes me as backwards to waste points on it, given that it 
will go up on its own through use.

Having a 27 (working it up) in 1HS vs a 35 (spending points) at level 6 
is pretty irrelevant. And that 'worked up 1HS' will easily catch up to 
the cap as levels start taking longer to push through.

Sure, if you are having trouble keeping your primary weapon skill 
maxxed, using just one weapon, in your 30s and 40s... odds are you are 
powerlevelling (although all the XP bonuses and reduced death penalties 
over the last five years, have made levelling much much faster overall, 
so these days even a good regular group could level you up fast enough. 
If that's the case take a break, slow things down, and go solo for a bit 
to catch them up, and its an opportunity to see what you can really do, 
and learn your class. But sure, if your 25th level and your 1HS is 
lagging 15 points behind the cap (3 levels worth), sure, go drop 15 
points into it... you'll have around 100 of them lying around anyway, 
and they don't have any other use.

Having your skills lag a few points behind the level cap (ie 5-10) (the 
'a' category above) is not a bad thing. And the 'b' category... things 
like riposte... are definately not worth spending points on.

Basically, we're saying spend points to get you in the neighborhood of 
the cap, (without actaully reaching the cap to avoid wasting the free 
skillups) not to avoid spending points at all.

If you are playing the game without PLing in PC or in temperance groups 
where the twinked enchanter is MT -and- out melee damaging you then, 
your primary weapon skill should rise fast enough to remain at the cap 
without spending points (and probably even a 2nd or 3rd weapon skill). 
But yeah, if it starts lagging, drop a few points in it... or go solo 
for a bit...

And as you noted, at high levels, everything will cap out anyway, easily 
enough (due in part to your higher 'learning stats', and the longer 
levels), and without help.
