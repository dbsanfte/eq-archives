The funny part is that I have no idea how we *didn't* get killed. We had 
probably 5 or 6 sarnaks on us, mostly recruits but a legionairre also. 
Everyone in the group ran off to safety, I ran around in wolf form in the 
field in front of the sarnak fortress to occupy the sarnaks for a few 
minutes. I eventually zoned, and when I came back everyone had logged back 
in and the main attacker in our group (a bard) was out front fighting a 
sarnak. Her and I are the only ones who didn't log, and she didn't even 
zone.

For the rest of the time she was logged on sarnaks would RUN out of the 
fort and attack us at the right ledge. We didn't have to pull anything for 
a couple of hours, they always came out to attack our bard. Not sure what 
caused them to always train on her, but it was damn good exp. On many 
occasions I thought we were doomed, but we won. During one such fight 
there was a revealer, two adherents, a dragoon, and a legionnaire. In 
another fight we had an adherent, two legionnaires, and seven recruits all 
attacking us. We ranged from level 22-29, with most in the middle 
somewhere. I think the only reason we were able to survive was our 
enchanter's mezmerizing, that's invaluable in such situations.
