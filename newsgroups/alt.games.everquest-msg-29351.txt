Actually, I think its quite a bit more a matter of theres absoltuely nothing
over there worth seeing, unless you're 1) a Barbarian Shaman, 2) Going on a
Vox raid or 3) willing to spend time in an extremely poorly designed dungeon
(Permafrost).

Sebilis is quite a bit harder to get to than anywhere on Western Antonica, but
I bet you can count the number of 52+ that don't know how to get *there*
without having to take off your shoes.  (and most of those 10 will probably be
DrOOds / N3cr0s who plan on kiting wurms in Skyfire all the way to 60.)
