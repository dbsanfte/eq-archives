    Varys strongly from place to place. Some mobs are "caster friendly", but
are stuck in the same place as high HP, high MR aggro mobs. And zones like
Grieg's are right off the scale - I haven't met greens that hit that hard
many other places.

    Nice story, tangential to the point at best. Look at the items
dropping - the progression is there. What used to drop off nameds in
Mistmoore now drop as randoms in Eastern Wastes and off "boss mobs" in
Netherbian Lair. The best rogue dirk in Guk matched up with a random rare
drop in Kaesora, and was matched by a random drop off XP mobs in Netherbian
Lair. Even look at the newbie quest armour that's coming from the revamped
newbie zones. Stuff is getting better with time at the same difficulty
level.

    No it won't, unless you're the greatest tuner in history. It only
narrows when an item can be twinked. Look at that Venemous Axe of the Velium
Brood - could any level 35 group get that? No? They sure as hell can USE it.
And that's the problem - by slapping level limits on everything you don't
stop twinking, you just break it down into steps. "From levels 1 to 10
little Boris will use this, then 11-15 he uses this, then...."

    It isn't realistic in terms of making sure folks use what drops for
them. It may be a good model for making casters and melees balance at a
given level - time will tell there.

    Only if you don't believe mobs in newer expansions were playtested to
higher and higher standards.

    What server are you on? My server has two AoW-capable guilds, and two
other guilds that can clear NToV in addition to other motley guilds.
Everything is far from dead by the next day. It takes a guild a day just to
clear PoG and bag Tunare, with maybe enough time afterwards (depending on
the size of the day crew) to bag a quickie encounter like Rumblecrush or
Grieg.

    Well-scripted ring events are fun. Mindless hordes, wasting my time, are
not. And events with broken scripting are right out the window.

    Who is asking for instant? One rare drop to trigger an event, ok. We'll
get it when XP grinding. Five?!? For anyone to bother doing the encounter
more than once or twice (and remember, unused content is bad), the loot has
to be fantastic to justify wasting the time. Then you get the *massive*
mudflation at the top end of the game, which is also bad.

    Full stop. So the item rewards aren't sufficient? Then figure ways to
STOP GIVING ITEM REWARDS. Examples below.

    Not a lot if I could give that SSoM or Orc Impaler right back to the
quest NPC for a full yellow of alt XP, doable only at the target levels for
the SSoM/Impaler quests. Or if the quest gave out regular XP (and lots of
it), or a pile of plat, or a hard-to-raise faction for another, better
quest, or was just yet another link in a series of weapon quests (I realize
those two are linked). Those are all nice solutions, no? I'm particularly
fond of the alt XP one - it'd be nice to see people use that at lower
levels, rather than wait to 60.

> Should we not bother having quests or
> dropped items lower than level 50?

    Ah, dropped items! Not hard to get them up to snuff. A series of
trade-in quests could handle it, if all you wanted to do was upgrade the
weapons. "Hur hur, me take dat dere Yakatingy fur a [Sword Balanced to
Luclin Standards]. Itz No Drop, dough. An' yew need [Faction Gained From
Killing Frogloks] if yew tink I'z gunna trade!" Ok, my Troll stinks today,
but you get the idea. Now you have a droppable item leaving the economy, and
the new item can't just be twinked onto a character without some faction
work done. And that took how much thought? Imagine the ideas that folks
could come up with if they thought about it some more! But no - far easier
to restrict existing content than add new content, right?

> Low and mid-level content has to have a point, and it won't if its rewards
> don't matter.

    Then make the rewards matter by tailoring them to the game as it is now.
If the Ghoul Lord dropped 1200 pp instead of a Yak I bet the players camping
him would be thrilled, no matter how bad mudflation gets. Or if he gave a
faction boost big enough to allow someone to trade that Yak with Zimbittle
for the Sword Balanced to Luclin Standards, which if it ever got mudflated
away could be exchanged for the Sword Balanced to Planes of Power Standards.

    Or to create rewards that cannot be obtained from droppable items.

caps.

    You don't think there'd be a market for Yaks if people that had enough
"I killed Frogs" faction could turn it in for a nifty sword that is
appropriate for a level 49 frog to drop? :-)
