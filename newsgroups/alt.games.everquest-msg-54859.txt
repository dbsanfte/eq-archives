You could go for the rubber bondage gear look for her and go with the
flayed shardwurm skin  tunic and legs.  It will have the default
"leather" graphics which to me on high elf females looks like rubber
bondage gear.  Esp since leggings don't show up as leggings but as an
ankle length skirt if wearing a leather graphic item.  I think Mammoth
hide leggings are also default leather graphic and are all/all.  Maybe
some of the wolf fur/bear fur stuff that is all/all questable from the
millers in QH for the hands/feet.
