No try about it.

The statement was something about only necros can fear kite.

Whether an SK has to med after or not, it doesnt change the fact he can
fearkite.

As for darkness costing more mana, sure it does, but its also a decent dot.
Cascading Darkness is over 1100 damage over the course of its snaring
