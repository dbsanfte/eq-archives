  Then make sure your points are relevant to the discussion, or better
explain your point.

  From the character of this post, I'm guessing your point was "You
don't always get what you want."  That's true.  However, I'm not
really talking about what "I want", at least not for my own sake.  I'm
just trying to figure out where the balance is supposed to lie.
Either there is a reason casters have the gameplay advantage of being
able to get bound anywhere, or there isn't.  If there is a reason, I
so far have not heard it.  If there isn't, why not get rid of the
silly rule?

  All of my characters are casters, except my shadow knight on Firiona
Vie.  On FV, casters are bound by the same rules as melee classes when
it comes to binding (apparently SOMEBODY thought it was a good idea).
So if they did change it so melee classes could be bound anywhere a
caster can, none of my current characters would benefit.
