Well, Kunark dragon means max 32K HP, so four MB Wizards can just have to
average 8K damage each to win right there.  I think the only way you could
lose with that setup would be if all four of the Wizards do the minimum
possible MB damage.  Heck, you could probably get rid of the 60 Tank, and
just let the Cleric hold aggro while the Wizards MB.  What's the casting
time on MB?  Is it shorter than DA's duration?
