Easy!

1) A single example fails to prove the general case.

2) No one is being forced to join in a "homosexual lifestyle", even if
there was such a thing.  A gay/lesbian/bisexual big brother won't
change a kid's current or future "lifestyle" in the sense you miss-use
the word.

3) "Big Brothers-Big Sisters organizations declined repeated requests
for an interview, but say parents have the final say in approving
their child's mentor. "  Hmm, sounds like parents have a choice to me,
no "forcing" here.

4) "However, school-based programs are not required to reveal whether
a child is paired with a gay or lesbian mentor. "  Well, if parents
care they can ask, no one is "forcing" them to anything.   Unless you
want to claim these school-based programs are mandatory?

5) Notice that Big Brothers- Big Sisters of America Inc. is creating
this policy.  A PRIVATE organization is making a policy affecting its
affiliates.  This is not a law or government regulation, this does not
affect the general public.   This is like McDonald's telling its
restaurants that a new dress code is now in effect, regardless of what
individual managers may like.

6) "A spokesman for Big Brothers-Big Sisters claims integrating
homosexual mentors into local chapters is a longstanding policy. The
only difference now is that locals are now required to comply whether
they support it or not."  So this is not so much a new policy as an
enforcement of an existing policy.

7) No one is forced to used the programs offered by Big Brothers-Big
Sisters.

8) The general public is not affected.

9) There is no such thing as "the homosexual lifestyle".



Not a bad piece, overall, although I would have done some editing for
structure and fleshed out a few points.   I'm sure you'll find a way
to disagree with all the comments above, and probably see firm plans
for an HIV+ muppet in there too.
