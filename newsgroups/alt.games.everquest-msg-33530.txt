Oasis, Level 16 Necromancer, new spells, new pet, new DoT's.

I'm excited to try the new DOT's. I mem spells, summon pet, buff bet, buf
myself, Dark pact and I med for full mana. Ok, i am full mana, half life or
less, who cares, I am a necro right ?Ah , a even orc, cool. Darkness, send
pet. I am really close to him and cast Infectious Cloud on the orc. You were
hit by non-melee for 20 damage! WTF. Until I realize what's going on, orc is
dead. Heath bar is droping. Arg! I need a bug, a cat, a damn snake to tap
life.
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT ...

Now  I know Infectious Cloud is an AE DoT.
