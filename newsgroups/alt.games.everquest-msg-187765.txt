From the shadows, the mysterious "Catastrophe"

Wow, not many people go to Nurga. Not because it's bad (it isn't), but
because it's so far off the beaten track. Gotta give kudos to you for
that.

You are correct on both easy cycle zones. Boring, exceedingly easy,
not particularly good exp when you're used to better (dungeon exp).

How desperate are you for that level? Highkeep is a possibility - not
the goblins, but upstairs, nobles, bards, and Isabella. Not really
sure how strong your pet is at that level, whether or not it can
handle them. Highkeep exp for those mobs is jacked, just like it was
for the gobbies ten and fifteen levels earlier - a consequence of a
very high zone experience modifier (*thumbs nose at our new newsgroup
resident idiot*) presumably.

If that's not your thing (or its too hard at 45, it might be), you
have other options. CoM maybe, though how well do BL split multiple
mob pulls. EW and possibly Kael of course. SolB and LG. Dawnshroud and
other super laggy luclin zones I can barely move in. OOT and Timo.
Jaggedpine. Kaesora.
