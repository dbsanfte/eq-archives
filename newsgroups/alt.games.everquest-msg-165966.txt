Thanks. I'm toying with the idea of getting some AA love before JPF 
starts going light blue on me, since XP is so easy and plentiful here. 
Another question, then... I'd like to ding 54 and see how many mobs do 
go light blue then. Is it possible to take a death, unding, set AA to 
100% and have the XP from the rez go to AA instead of going to the XP 
pool and make you ding again?
