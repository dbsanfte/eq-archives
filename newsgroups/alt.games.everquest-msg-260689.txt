Maximum PC, PC Gamer, and Computer Gaming World magazines have a feature
every month where they list the best hardware choices for both a "killer"
system and a "budget" system.

I'm at work right now so I don't have access to the current issues, but
I'll try to have a look tonight.

Some past winners in the "budget monitor" category have been:

Optiquest Q71   17" $130
Viewsonic E90fb 19" $225
NEC FE991SB-BK  19" $290
