The one I *really* love is when Tiru and I have to run through Oasis on
the way back from LGuk or whatever. Tiru still doens't go anon most of
the time, (52 Vicar) and she drops into tell hell with rez requests.
Yes, I'm talking about players below level 20 demanding a 50+ Rez.  To
see them following along bitching is about the funniest thing, since in
the time they spent whinging, they could have already made up the xp
they lost on two crocs. I think I got my very first xp restoring rez (a
fifty percenter) at around level 45.
