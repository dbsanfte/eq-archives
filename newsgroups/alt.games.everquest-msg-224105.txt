The subject seems to change but they all mention paypal and have a .scr
attachment, for example:
"YOUR PAYPAL.COM ACCOUNT EXPIRES"

Currently not identified and Nortons/McAfee etc wont detect it. I take it
for granted everyone here in A.G.E is technically literate enough to have
"view file extensions" turned on and that .scr files equals virus, but I
just thought I would mention it as this virus is currently sodomising our
network with a 2ft diameter pine cone...
