I've been playing my Beastlord since November, and she is now at level
52.  /played tells me almost 12 days.  Although a good deal of my
levels are from LDoNs, if a group is offered anywhere else, I'll take
it.  I have just as much fun exploring, seeing new places, killing new
monsters, as being in a great, tight-knit group in a LDoN.  The planes
are pretty exciting to me, but there are lots more places I'd like to
see too.  Recently I've been doing LoY zones to get my LoY
spells...especially spending lots of time in Torgiran for that stupid
powder...grrr...but it felt so good when it finally did drop!

Anyway, I have been to the Karanas...I remember back on my Ranger on
my first server I decided to run from Freeport to Qeynos at level 15. 
Died in Kithicor because I went in at night, and very nearly died in
High Hold Pass (camo ran out at JUST the right time), but otherwise I
made it safely.  Got killed by Froon and his brother on my new Ranger
while fooling around in WK, and I've also hunted in Splitpaw while
levelling my Beastlord and when helping a guildmate do the pally epic
turn-in.  Actually, with that pally I got to use the Nexus Portal for
the first time, both there and back.  Wasn't as fast as hiring a
teleport, of course, but it was definitely faster than running from
the Qeynos PoK book!  It was new, and therefore exciting, but all in
all I'm glad for the utility that the PoK books gives.  Actually, I
think, if you have the right attitude, they encourage more exploration
than before, but since I wasn't around then I shouldn't speculate.

So, yeah, I find it sad when there's someone who's been playing a year
and when I tell them I hunted in Unrest for a few levels in my 20's he
asks "where is that?"  But then again, for example, I've never been to
Rathe Mountains at all...one of these days, though!

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
