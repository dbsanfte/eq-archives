Dunno, would be a much bigger thing to see a second and later third stun 
on three seperate timers.  Being able to pick a snare from column A, a 
stun from column B, and a jolt from column C would also be much better 
than the current situation.  The information I've found doesn't say one 
way or the other, so far, and I'm quite a few levels shy of finding out 
for myself (level 32, Leg Cut, will be the first of the second tier 
abilities)

Another thought I had is that resists may be better... except that I'm 
pretty sure resists are based on my level, not the level of the spell.
