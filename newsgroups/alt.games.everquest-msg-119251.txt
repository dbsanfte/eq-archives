Try it.  I would, but he's never up. (yes, I play off prime also, some)

level 35, 2-3k hp, perma-rooted, summons, uses wizzy nukes a lot.  Clear the
guards in his room first, he won't agro while you do that.  Definitely want
to buff MR/FR/CR prior to combat, as well as having SLN, chloroplast,
thorncoat, as well as shield of thorns for when he summons you.

rotting, underbulk bile on first kill, fungus beast spores from a group
camping the cave just out from the Deep with Fireclaw in it.
