I recently upgraded to Outlook Express 6 (don't ask my why, I haven't a
clue). Now when I reply to a post my signature appears at the top, in the
top posting manner the MS seems to want to encourage, rather than at the
bottom of the page. I have been deleting it and using the insert->signature
option, but I would rather just have it appear in the correct place. Does
anyone know how to do this?

Better yet does anyone know of a better newsreader than Outlook Express? I
tried Agent before but that was much more than I needed. I'd like something
that is an integrated usenet/mail program. What does everyone else use?

Thanks all.
