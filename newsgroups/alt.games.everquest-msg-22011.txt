Not sure if i remember where I got it....Seb (Old Sebillis) or Chardock
probably.  In case anyone reading cares: Turning of the Unnatural drops in
the ToFS (Tower of Frozen Shadows) on the 7th floor.  A stupid place to put
a useless spell.  Only reason I know this is we got one today on way to kill
Tserrina and being the only cleric , I was the "lucky" winner.  Now my spell
book is complete through 54.  Not that I missed having it....its almost as
good as our "pet" hammer.  :)
