Found this item in Kael off "an angry storm giant commoner" <think thats
right> Crappy 2hb, useable only by large races. Someone said it was for a
quest , but I cant seem to find any info on it anywhere, talked to dozens of
NPCs in Thurgadin and Skyshrine, but none of them seem to have any interest
in my broom. Hoping someone here could maybe shed a little light on the
subject. If its not a very good quest, I think I may just keep my broom.
Nothing gets a chuckle like my Barbarian warrior walking into Kael or
Sebilis with his broom in hand, muttering something about "cleaning this
place up" =)

Thanks in advance,
