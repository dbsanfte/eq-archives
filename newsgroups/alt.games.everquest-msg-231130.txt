Do search for UI_charname_servername.ini
For advanced users:
Open that file with wordpad.

You will see a section like: (1280x1024 is my screen resolution you will see
yours)

[Skillswindow]
XPos1280x1024=0
YPos1280x1024=0
Width1280x1024=0
Height1280x1024=0

That should look something like this:
[Skillswindow]
XPos1280x1024=259
YPos1280x1024=135
Width1280x1024=300
Height1280x1024=240

Again you would have to know enough to be able to adjust that to your
resolution to fix it that way.


For a simpler solution:
Just delete the file.
Your window positions will be forgotten when you log in but you will then be
able to see skills again. IE you will have to move things about again to
suit your tastes.

If you have anything with a height and width of ZERO you cant see it




FYI, Deleting did NOT work for me.
