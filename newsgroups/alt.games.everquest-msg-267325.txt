Look at it like this. Instead of a newsgroup, think of it as a
group of people who meet at a coffeeshop to discuss Topic A. They
have been meeting at that coffeeshop for years and discussing,
mainly, Topic A with occasional forays into other topics, but,
on the whole, Topic A is what is discussed. Now, Topic B comes
along. It's related to Topic A but it's also totally different
than Topic A. There are people who are NOT interested in Topic
B that are still coming to that coffeeshop and sitting in the
same chairs they always did, but now there are a lot of people
also sitting in the same area, constantly talking about Topic
B. To the extent that it's almost impossible to hear if anyone's
talking about Topic A and to the extent, in my case at least,
I've almost quit even trying to find out if anyone's talking
about Topic A anymore.

What people who still want to talk about Topic A are saying is
'Hey, you people who want to talk about Topic B, please go sit
at another table so we can hear the people who want to talk about
Topic A <i.e., label the posts that are about EQ2> or find your own 
coffeeshop to talk in <i.e., make another newsgroup>.'

It's along the same lines as the groups of people who will target
a certain newsgroup to be 'taken over' so that the people who used
to frequent that newsgroup stop frequenting it. No, I'm not saying
that the motives are the same but it will end up having the same
effect in the long run.
