I did the same thing, kept low WIS with a half elf Druid.  It is hard, but
rest assured, it does get better.  I did a lot of grinds for plat, and spent
time buying and trading in bazaar.  I've now got pretty decent gear, and my
WIS is maxed.

As far as grouping, well, you don't HAVE to...I spent a lot of time soloing.
When I group, it's not necessarily for XP.  Groups are usually with guildies
for the fun of it.  I've always played solo when going for XP.  You may need
to re-evaluate your fighting tactics.  At level 40, I was getting away from
the root/rot method, and going to quadding.  As a Druid, you are a very
effective solo agent.  Depending on your game values, there are many places
you can solo...just look for good outdoor spaces where you won't interfere
with other people by pulling your kite.  The XP from four DB MObs pulled in
a kite makes up for the downtime while medding back to full to do it over
again.

www.eqdruids.com also has a lot of useful information about kiting, places
to hunt, etc.  aside from that, mail me if you want, and I'd be happy to
help if I can.
