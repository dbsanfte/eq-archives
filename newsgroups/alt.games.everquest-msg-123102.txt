If you only have the base version of the game, you will not be able to
go to the new Expansion areas (Kunark, Velious, Luclin). You will be
able to use the new zones that were added to the orginal game areas.

eq.castersrealm.com is a great place to start. Also try
www.everlore.com.

They recently changed the game to accelerate the first 10 levels. The
added an exp bonus and changed it so that when you die at levels 1-9
you respawn with all of your items. You won't have any trouble getting
started. It won't take you 3 months like it did the first time.

>What are some of the better servers for US Eastern Time Zone people .. or
>does that matter ?

Depends on how you define "best" You can filter the server list by
population count. If you are looking for a server with a lot of people
on it pick one from the bottom half of the list. If you would rather
play on a server that is less crowded, pick from the top of the list.

>How bout a good site to help with a starting Mage ? Like .. best race (is
>that the right word ?) and starting abilities ?

eq.castersrealm.com For a Mage (or any other INT caster...Necro,
Enchanter, Wizard) your primary stat is Intelligence (put most of your
bonus skill points into it). Mages rely on thier pets, so any race you
pick will do well.

If you are a social person you will not have any trouble finding
groups (unless you play on a server with a low population).

Well it really depends. "Solo" classes like Mages and Necros have a
tougher time getting groups quickly. At the lower levels (before you
have made a lot of friends or built a reputation) it is harder for
some classes to find pickup groups. Don't get discouraged.

>Anyhow .. just looking for some good newbie pointers and starters for
>someone wanting to be a Mage. 

Some pointers.....
1. Don't beg for money or items from other players.
2. Don't be afraid to ask for help and advice.
3. Take your time and enjoy the game. There is no prize for hitting
level 60.

>I'll be starting with nothing .. from scratch

It is much easier to start from scratch today than it was 2-3 years
ago.

>I can get the most fun out of it !

How you play will determine how much fun you get out of it. Play the
way you wan't to, and you should be fine.
