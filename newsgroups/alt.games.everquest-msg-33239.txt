Hi,

I used to play EQ but I canceled my account long ago.  Now I want to
come back to play with some higher level friends.  I want to buy a
lower priced account so I am looking for someone in the 40s, equipment
is optional, I am looking for levels primarily.

Please write me with the account information you are selling, and your
price.
