This is so true, too often I see people charging out into unfriendly
territory and just make a straight line to where they are going.  This is
not the way to do it.  Sure you want to take a direct route, but ALWAYS
look around you.  When I am running somewhere dnagerous, I routinely pan
my field of view back and forth (using strafe to counteract the turning so
I can keep running straight. I must admit I have it down to a science :)

Aye, the drachnics CAN be nasty if you are not careful.  Make the run with
your eyes open and patience in your fingers.  If you think you MIGHT aggro
something, wait, they will move.  The run is short so I really do not
anticipate you having any major problems, just be careful.

Aye Ive never died making the run with the good ol druid, but a few times
with my warrior (usually happens when going over that hill, things always
are waiting on the other side).  And that stupid Necro guy out there, he
whacked me once or twice.
