Question I have is, why would you want to see the "so-and-so is
inspecting you" message?

Either you hate that message, in which case turning it off would give
you piece of mind, or you don't care about it, in which case what
difference does it make whether you see it or not?

Only reason I can think of for having it on is so you have a trap
laid out to spot the people who are behaving rudely by inspecting.

Then again, I'm in the "could care less" camp, so its hard for me
to follow the "hate people who inspect" camp logic sufficiently
to really examine whether it would somehow be bad for them
to not get the message.
