Aha, I thought he was referring to the zone being broken.  Verant did do 
some tuning in that zone so that taunt now seems to work, though I'm not 
sure I like the changes.  At least before the zone was pretty much empty, 
now even the wimpiest of finger-wagglers can be found in CT.  I *liked* 
the idea of a zone where a SK/Paly is a better tank than a warrior, too 
bad the rest of the playerbase seems to disagree.

Boots are named Boots of Flowing Slime, AC7, +20HP, +65Mana, +10MR, FT3.  
I sold them for 110kpp +fungi tunic, saw two pair sell for 120kpp this 
week.  I expect that the price will drop, since I know of 4 pair on Inny 
in the past 2 weeks.  Very nice end-gear item for a caster, no effect on 
bard mana regen, which means they're useless to me.
