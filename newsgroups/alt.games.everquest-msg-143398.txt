Because saying "raids have to be cancelled if no warrior, enchanter or
shaman attends" implies that ONLY those 3 classes are needed on raids, and
to that i say bullshit.

When a raid can be cancelled because several classes aren't there that are
needed, whats the point in mentioning only the warrior, chanter and cleric?
Yeah it was correct in a sense, but it was misleading.  To imply only those
3 classes make a raid is bullshit.

Which is my whole point.  Thx, come again

Just like it sucks when no mage is there.. why did you feel fit to only
state warr/chanter/cleric in all your examples though?

Take a mob that your guild can kill comfortably.. sub in a SK/pali with the
warrior, or a bard with the enchanter.. tell me if you can't do it still

Sure you can't kill Tormax without a warrior.. or even kill him period - wtf
difference does it matter?  Change Tormax to a mob name that more reflects
your guild.
