Ok my wife and I finally shelled out the dough for GoD on both
accounts.
We were in Natimbi not 10 minutes before someone came up asking me for
buffs.
I'm a mage lvl 53, and she's a cleric lvl 64.  

To wit I simply stated, I'm a mage I don't do buffs.  My wife stepped
in though and said she would help, so she cast a whole string of buffs
on this poor fella, who we came to find out was on a corpse run.

Anyways after about 5 minutes of buffing and talking, the guy was
getting ready to leave and said "Can I get an invis please?".
Then my wife without missing a beat said, "Now will that be regular or
undeaded?"
