You know how long it can take to set up a skill gain blue?  Being in a safe
place where you can use archery, or a weaker weapon, and develop skill takes
a lot of time and trouble.  If I was somewhere more dangerous, yes, there
would be lots of blues, and above.  Many opportunities to gain skill usually
means more risk.  So I go to somewhere where I have trouble finding a blue,
and can solo two or three at a time if I need to.  Almost every time someone
comes along and slaughters my archery target even though I TELL THEM NOT TO
KILL IT.  After not listening to me, and continuing to attack, they almost
always say "I didn't do anything wrong!"

That is so much BS.  You ARE doing something wrong.  Ask if I need help.
I'll politely say, "No, I'm practicing archery," or piercing, or blunt, or
whatever.  But if you take my target, I will call you an idiot, because that
is what you appear to me when you do so.  Is what you are doing a
/petitionable offence?  No.  But it is exceptionally impolite.

Now, at times I will have gotten some adds on me, and I will look like I am
in danger.  If I get unwanted help in that situation, I accept it.  I know
how hard it can be to select a surrounded person, and the easy thing to do
is nail the adds.  In fact, I may thank you if I notice this happening.  But
there is a BIG difference between pulling adds off someone and walking up
and slaughtering the single target that that are killing.
