Verant will never ask for you password or loggin, they don't need it.
No beta signup will ever ask for it. As with luclin they pick beta
testers from people playing on the test server and don't solicit them
anyway.

Only reason you'd ever need your login or password was on the sony eq
account page if you were having a problem like a lost password or
account you could not get into, or on the message board, outside of
using it in game.
