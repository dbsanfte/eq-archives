Is there any way to find out what characters one has on what servers?

I started EQ about a year ago with a host of aborted characters on
various servers.  Since then I have taken a mage to 60.  But now I'm
curious about the characters I left behind.

I spent an evening logging on to a few servers.  Took forever.  Found
a few old characters, but surely there must be an easier way.

I had a druid up to 20.  Where is she??
