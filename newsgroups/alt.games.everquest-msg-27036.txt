Anymore?!?
You got that backwards.
Clerics are the ONLY viable healers at the end game.
Shamans are gods until they hit the big mobs then they kinda go down
the crapper.

At levels 1 to 50, shaman is the perferred healer for practically any
exp group anywhere in the old world.  Hell at those levels even a
unrezzed death isn't that big of a hardship since it's only about 90
mins of solid exp grinds you've lost.

It's only when you start doing mobs which are unslowable (there are a
few) that clerics become the only viable healers.

Trust me, it sucks for you now, but when you hit level 60, you will be
the "critical" class for practically every major raid.

As long as you have complete heal, at the end game you'll out heal all
shamans/druids.  A level 39 cleric WILL outheal a level 60
shaman/druid against an unslowable mob.
