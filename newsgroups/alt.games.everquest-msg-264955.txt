Only he didn't exactly write in to the "head office," he wrote to the
technical support line.  Having worked tech support for MCI, I can
tell you from experience that these are probably not the right people
to address complaints to; I sure didn't have anything to do with
complaints customers expressed to me.  (And boy, did some of them ever
express those complaints.  On and on, at great length, sometimes.)
What's more, as buggy as update 2 has been, they're probably so
swamped in actual *help requests* from people who *are* still paying
customers...well, one can see where their priorities would lie.

If he really wanted (or still wants) to complain, he should have
written (or should still write) a pen and paper or
typewritten/computer-printed letter to NCSoft's snail address laying
it out in detail.  Those will go to the people who actually do need to
hear about that sort of thing and might be in a position to do
something about it--and they'll pay more attention, too, figuring that
since he took the time and effort to sit down and write out a letter
instead of hammering out some words on a screen, he must be really
ticked.
