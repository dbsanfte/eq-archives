I use them some for soloing (which I rarely do these days). One debuff
spell set for pulling, one DoT spellset for once you have it debuffed
and VP'd. 

I played around with them for buffing but could never get anything
that worked well. Main problem is that there are too many spells that
I just can't afford to be without in a dangerous situation...
Malos (Tigir's for LDoN)
Root
Slow
Cann4
Tnarg's
Quissence

... are all spells that I don't ever want to be without in a dangerous
situation. Having only 2 spell slots to rotate out makes the spellsets
useless. I'll just do it the old fashioned way. 

Might be worth revisiting now that I have a clicky root, that clears
out another spell gem.
