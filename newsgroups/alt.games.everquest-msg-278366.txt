Actually. Strictly speaking, if you are playing on an emu site most, if 
not all, of they eula simply doesn't apply, because you aren't using 
EQ's service, and don't actually -need- to agree to it. That weakens it 
substantially. 

What happens to the terms of an EULA if you click "I disagree"?? What if 
the EULA forbids you to sniff traffic and my ISP sniffs traffic are 
*they* in violation of the EULA? What if my brother takes my copy of the 
software and decompiles it (for the sake of argument lets assume it 
really was that simple) would *he* be in violation of the EULA?

there is nothing illegal about designing a product using your own code 
that interfaces with another product. No copyright is violated. Players 
are expected to have purchased EQ, and have rights to use the software 
more or less however they see fit. There is nothing illegal about 
reverse engineering. A great deal of innovation comes from seeing how 
other things work. 

The only anti-reverse engineering law is in america and only with 
respect to that ridiculous piece of law called the DMCA which forbids it 
only with respect to circumventing encyrption and copy protection 
mechanisms, and even that is beyond stupid.

Proection of security by making it illegal to look at how the lock works 
is good recipe for making shitty locks.

You punish people for theft of what the lock protects, not for finding 
out how the lock works.

They only really grey area of EQ emu comes to the EULA, which is pretty 
weak in terms of legal enforceablily at the best of times, and is 
further weakened by the fact that the developers/players may in fact be 
disagreeing with it.

While its definately not in the spirit of the game to sniff traffic, and 
SOE is welcome to ban any account that they catch doing it because its 
their server and they can ban for any reason they like, the reality is 
that its not *illegal*, nor should it be, to look at what is going on 
one's own LAN.

Think of the paradise for the Gator's of the world if they could sue you 
for tampering (packet sniffing, reverse engineering, etc) with your own 
computer. (In violation of so-called reverse engineering laws, in 
violations of copyright laws, in violation of the click-thru EULA for 
gator when you installed yaiet (yet another ie toolbar).

If you buy a few hundred dollars worth of Warhammer 40k models, decide 
you don't like the rules why shouldn't you write some of your own? 

Would you truly feel that you had violated both your creative and legal 
integrity to use those models for something other than by-the-book 
warhammer 40k?

Give me break!!

What makes playing EQ on an emu server morally or ethically any 
different. (I'll concede its legally slightly different because 
warhammer 40k hasn't figured out how to attach an EULA to their models 
yet, describing exactly what you can and cannot use them for.)
