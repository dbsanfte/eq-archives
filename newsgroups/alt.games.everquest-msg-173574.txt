North Ro grassy area (avoid the desert for now), East Commons (be careful no
to go too deep), or if you have Planes of Power, you can get to *any*
starting city, each with it's own newb areas.  Personally, I like Kaladim
(good bone chip quest there), and Felwithe/Kelethin (lots of people, and orc
belts too!)

do something like, " /shout L5 Warrior LFG, got swords will travel" or just
ask people if they'd like to group if you see them.  You're probably better
off solo until you're L8 or so, but have fun!

You can run background applications while in EQ, but can't access them
without crashing EQ.  There are other third party softwares (EQWindows) that
will let you switch between EQ and other apps, but this violates the EULA,
and can get you banned.

Good luck and good hunting!!
