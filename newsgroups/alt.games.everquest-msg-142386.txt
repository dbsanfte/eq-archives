 Out of context? The whole post is there. What exectly is out of
context? He said he was amiable to CoV and you presumed he meant Amiable
to Coldain. I was just looking for some clarification as to what made
you presume that he meant Coldain and not CoV as stated.

 What correlation would that be? They are independent of each other. I
can be (and was) kos to CoV while at the same time being non-kos to
Coldain.
