Well, this seems to be a popular viewpoint.

It SOUNDS good, but you have to look at it closer.  What does that MEAN;
"Stay at home if you're ill-informed"?  Everyone conjures up a picture of
some ignorant slackjaw stumbling into the voting booth, and pressing levers
at random.  My guess would be that the percentage of people that are
actually completely ignorant about politics, and STILL could be goaded into
going to vote by a message on USENET is around 0%.  (Ok, if you push me I'll
admit to 0.000000000000001%)  Hardly a significant swing group.

SO, if you disregard the people that are completely ignorant, what do people
mean when they say ill informed?

Generally, they mean anyone that isn't educated with the facts that THEY
believe to the point of agreeing with THEM on who should hold office.  Most
of the people that post about how ignorant all of these voters are mean the
ones that don't agree with THEM, thus they just want anyone that doesn't
vote their way to stay home.

Same here.  Obviously you're not ignorant from MY viewpoint.  What do you
want to bet that those who voted against our candidates would include us in
their "too ignorant to vote" category?
