To Americans, yes. I'm American. I'm VERY proud of where I was born and 
my country and what we do FOR the world. So why would I care about what 
happens elsewhere?

Yes that's right. It SHOULDN'T happen here. As I said, I'm an American 
and I don't want it happening here. Again WHY should I care if someone 
in East Timor dies in a bombing. Why should MY tax dollars go there to 
help rebuild what someone else has destroyed?? I could care less about 
the "Protection Of The World". Why don't "they" care as much about those 
daily terrorist attack daily in THEIR country. Do you hear an outcry at 
every bomb that goes off in Jerusalem or Haifa? NO. Why? Because I'm 
American and don't CARE about what happens in Isreal.. or Saudi Arabia.. 
or Lebanon.. or "*elsewhere* in the world". You know what I do care 
about? The six people I PERSONALLY know who worked in the WTC. You see I 
grew up in NJ and know PLENTY of people who work in NY.

Personally I wouldn't say anything till I saw the gunsite films.. Then 
it would only be: "Gotcha" and a big smile.

I consider myself sensible. I don't want to "nuke Afghanistan" or Iran 
or anyplace else. What I want is simple: The persons responsible turned 
over to American authorities for trial and execution in the US and the 
government of the country harboring them dismantled... by force of 
explosion if necessary.
