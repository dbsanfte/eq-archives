	No -- PRECISELY because there is no place to go.

	The game has a level cap.  You get to 60, and then you STOP.  Once you get
there, there is a level of mob difficulty you can handle at a reasonable rate
and that's that.  Going after anything bigger is just foolhardy.  AA does not
have a large effect on this, either; those abilities are geared towards raids.
Soloists simply can't handly anything larger, so putting bonuses on larger
mobs does not help.  Groups have to split the experience, so unless you can
kill bigger mobs faster than you could kill the smaller ones they're not
helped either.

	What's wrong with it is that it simply doesn't work that way.  If you want
people to keep moving then they have to keep gaining levels, too.
