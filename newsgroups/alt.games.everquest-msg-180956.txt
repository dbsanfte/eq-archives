That would be incorrect. I posted the relevant info and relating
evidence for others, if they wish to report you. I did not call or
contact them, myself. You're obviously clueless as to what abuse is, and
I was under the impression you might learn to behave. It appears that
you are incapable of learning.

I work as a sysadmin and handle abuse reports. Yours, with the evidence
and a quick Google of USENET would be sufficient for a warning to the
user. If I received the same flack you are replying with, the warning
would go immediately to a disconnect.

You were aware that Google shows multiple hits on multiple groups on
this spam, right?
