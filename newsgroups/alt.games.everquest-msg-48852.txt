Well, for a farewell post, this one isn't as stinky or spiteful in spirit as
most.  Still basically 'anonymous,' as none of us know who you are...so you
could be anyone...including an industry spy for Mythic.

I'm interested in DAoC.....but I'm waiting to see the testemony of the

maybe possibly buying it.  Maybe.

Hope it's not as buggy as the opening releases of AO & WWII Online.
