Just finished Boots quest; me Lvl 35 Wizard with a Level 35 Ranger in the 
lead. Wolf totem and pathfinding were enough to get us through (Charger no 
good becuase of the water hazards), luckily didn't have too much of a 
problem with the train in Feerott - but had to do it twice because of a 
missed update!! Hardest I thought was Zek run

Have to shelve the boots now until (I think??) Lvl 42!
