  It happened so fast...

  I had marked the past weekend for strong efforts to get in long term fast
XP groups, in WoS-north wall, MPG, RCoD. It was paying off: Adas was
closing steadily on 68.
  My guild leader then threw an idea out into guildchat: "What would you 
guys
say to a move that could double our numbers overnight and put us right back
in the thick of raiding?"
  We all knew what this meant. I asked "Who are we merging with?"
  The answer, it turned out, was...strangely enough...Acropolis.
  Sigh. Looked like Adas was going to spend some more time as a free agent.
  But wait! Acropolis was no longer a required raiding guild! Their web page
saying otherwise was out of date. Adas could FINALLY go to an uberguild!
  Well, one that had a history of uberness on THIS server.
  The very next day, it was done. Both guilds gathered in the Nexus and we
voted with our virtual feet. Adastraea moved to Acropolis. (Rabotev will be
a free agent for a while; he isn't progression oriented. In fact, he may 
retire...)
  We proceeded to take down Slavedriver Menlo faster than ever. Some
people had second thoughts about the move, and left Acrop immediately.
The founders of CotF are talking about keeping it going as a family-only 
guild,
though I will try to keep in touch. Most of us, however, will be ready to
move the new enlarged Acropolis into the elemental planes over the next few
weeks. They have much experience dealing with a certain Warlord.
  Hmmm...checking out the Sol Ro minis, I suddenly find they don't drop 
anything
better than I can get in Omens zones...I used to drool over their drops, 
hoping
I'd get a chance at them one day. Now, there's better ahead.
