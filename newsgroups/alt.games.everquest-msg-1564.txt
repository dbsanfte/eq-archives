At high levels you will not enter melee very much, also from a friend I group
with, once you get invis you can do a quest for a +10INT dagger.  It seems he
uses daggers as they seem to have incredible stats and very low weight.  In
general after level 20 you will have your weapon because of stats, not so much
for damage output.

That being said, you should try to keep 1HB, 2HB and piercing all maxed out.  At
least up to level 10 or 15, you want to be atleast proficient when you pick up
that ubber weapon and want to jump in on melee.  But in higher levels your group
will probably want you to med up and cast on it.

You will never stand toe to toe soloing.
