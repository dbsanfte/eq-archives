I have all three current systems, as you can see in my sig. It really
boils down to what you want. They all have things going for  them. If
you plan on playing with friends or playing online, I'd say go with
the Xbox. The Xbox and Gamecube can serve more people at once, up to
4, whereas the PS2 has only 2 controller ports. MS has by far the best
online strategy, so if you want to play games online (broadband only),
go Xbox. If you like the single player or just play with one other
person at a time, go PS2. It has a much larger library of games, but
their online service sucks rocks. Nintendo's online presence is worse
than Sony's, but both of them are a distant second and third to Xbox
Live. If you like series like Zelda, Metroid, and Mario, then of
course the Gamecube is the only way to go. As far as the DVD issue is
concerned, the point is moot IMHO. You can buy a DVD remote for the
Xbox for $25, but it will still play games without it and save them to
the internal hard drive. For the PS2, you have to buy a memory card
(PS1 memory cards will not work for saving PS2 games,  but will work
for PS1 games in the PS2) and that costs $25.

If you go with an Xbox though, make sure it's one with the new smaller
controller.
