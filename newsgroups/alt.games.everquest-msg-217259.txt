In optimal conditions?
I do a hell of a lot more than that in "optimal conditions" good LOS Raid
buffs GoTF and TS I'll do quite a bit more than that for 2 minutes.
Sub optimal I still range between 130-250 or so Archery is very sporatic
with a few really high runs and a few low ones. Over all a parse from the
other night was about 148 sustained DPS this included time meleeing as well
as not doing any damage while pulling mobs back to camp.
The rogue in the group was real close and we'd take turns being top damager
in the group as well.
So I'd take a sec before pointing out someone elses ignorance.

Oh and your friend with the Stonewood is hurting his dps using that bow.
He'd get better damage out of any of the other elemental bows. Stonewoods
are for meleeing. You want real damage you really want a featherwood anyway.
