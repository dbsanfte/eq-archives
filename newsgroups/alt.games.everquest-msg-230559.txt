It's a great item.  Mainhand lute with 2.2 modifier plus:
Illusion: Werewolf
Increase ATK by 45 (L44) to 66 (L65)
Increase Attack Speed by 40%
Increase STR by 23 (L44) to 30 (L58)
This buff will be very nice for the meleeing bard at least into the late
50's.  40k is a lot for it though.  Think I paid like 5k for it a long time
ago.
