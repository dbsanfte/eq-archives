yes see other posts with good description of costs

Or reimburse the cost consider they burn mana as well for those spells so be
a bit more generous as they suffer downtime for it. For a 1 dot spell give
at least 25pp (depends a bit on how it's arranged on your server) but be
generous. Also try to find some fixed casters for those bufs, hopefully they
remember you and if you are in shit they might be more willing to rez you.

Monks get ac penalty if their weight gets over 48. So most likely they offer
those to get cash wich is presumably lighter. Though i can't imagine that
gems weigh that much.
