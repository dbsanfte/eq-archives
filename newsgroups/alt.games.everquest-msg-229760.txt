I don't agree. TR skilling is boring and cumbersome. I welcome the new
changes. I think how the system now is dumb, it certainly doesn't take any
intelligence to be forced to look up the recipie for 4,760 different things
and then laboriously be required to click hundreds of times just to make one
thing. As things stand now, I'd just as soon as hire a braindead rhesus
monkey to do my tradeskilling.
