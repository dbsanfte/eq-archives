The attitude I mean is ,that instead of rewarding the player,they take
away from him,not granting us the dirt under the fingernails,I really
have a problem with an attitude like this in rl too.
I dont see your point with "this has happened a long time",so you
are saying just live with it ? My point here was that they are wasting
resources to make the game *worse* instead of better,a pretty weird
concept if you ask me.

I dont take it personally,I am concerned that EQ1 will loose more and
more players without getting new ones.

Oh yeah,another unasked *improvement*.

>And just in case you leave...CIHYS? :P

No,why?
I am still playing,I want the game to be better and attract more
new players,the points I mentioned drive people away from it.
