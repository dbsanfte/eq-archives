I get your point, and I agree on that it makes sense.
My reason was that out of ten people or so I talked to about this,
I only had 2 people agree with me, and I didn't get any reasons
out of the others as to WHY they got upset _that much_...
I still believed I could get some backup on this, and if
not, then at least some reasons I could follow...
Only one so far was that people could have zoned in
after my shouts....
