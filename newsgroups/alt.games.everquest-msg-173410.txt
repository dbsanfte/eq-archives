Where do you imagine that Americans fund these bombings? I can think
of few instances of this happening here. People who have raised money
here are forced to describe the destination of the money to a great
degree. Anyone who even has a incidental link to the Terrorist
provisionals in Ireland are pointed out.

Iraq, delivers aid to Palestinian Terrorists as a matter of course.
They also have camps IN IRAQ training Al Queda elements. The proof is
there from orbit, and has been reported by BBC, FOX, and AP wire.
