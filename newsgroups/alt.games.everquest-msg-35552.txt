That conflicts with your statement saying that you don't kill anything that
cons amiable to you. So, now you need a spell to stop something that you
don't attack in the first place from attacking you?

RP'ing a druid does NOT mean you don't have to kill them. You can call it
"keeping the numbers low", "thinning out the herd", "giving a peaceful end
to the sick", or whatever. But completely refusing to kill any animal that
cons amiable to you is just silly.

Now, if bears and wolves had faction associated with them, it'd be a whole
different story. That's why druids tend to (i've seen a few idiots that
have) not kill Treants.
