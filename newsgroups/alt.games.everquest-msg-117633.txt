I just spent 6+ hours getting the Bat Lord (or whatever he is
called) in The Warrens to drop a hat so I could get a 2ac int agi
dex belt.  It would have been terrible, but since I was the only one
there I used an alternate plan.  I set a clock to go off every 50 or
so minutes.  Alarm would go off I then put the DVD I was watching on
pause go kill the Bat Lord, say "damn no hat again" and go back to
my movie.  The only reason I could do this was I am laid off at
present.  Getting called back to work in the next few weeks and be
working 7 days a week, no hope to do any quests then =(.
