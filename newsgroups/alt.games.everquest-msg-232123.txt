No.  The elevator worked with 194 skill.

This one was in a tower with first a transparent ramp then a broken bridge
leading to it.  Go through a door (unknown skill but low enough), fight
through a tower, along a bridge with a turn in it, jump the gap, then open
another door.  *That* door required 200 skill.  I got the skill practice on
the "unknown" door.
