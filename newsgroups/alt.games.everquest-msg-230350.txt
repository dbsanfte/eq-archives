That's an odd problem.  First suggestion is to make sure your video card
drivers are up to date.

Beyond that I'd ask what card you were using.  I'm not sure what would cause
such behavior, but I'd imagine perhaps a lower end card that can only do
small textures might have such a problem (in which case there may be no
hope, you'd have to leave the sky off).
