This is yet another place where EQ is different games at different levels of
advancement.  In the medium-high end game (elemental planes, pre-KT GoD, OoW
xp zones), a slower is necessary to an efficient group.

It's far less true at lower levels, and even at former high-end content.
Current stuff pretty much needs it.  Well, at least as much as it needs the
rest of the "required" roles.  You can do without crowd control in a lot of
places, just because all pulls are single.  You can do without tanking and
healing if you have a root/nuke group.  You can do with less-than-perfect
members in any role, but the key roles really are:

puller (almost anyone can do, specialist not necessary in most places)
crowd control (in some places, unnecessary others)
tank
slower
healer
dps

Also, in many cases, other utility is very handy - rez, port, track, buff,
invis, etc. but these aren't as required as the 4 pillars.

Some groups can do a 65 hard ldon without slows, but not many.  65 easy and
earlier are not current content.  In those, Enchanters are a DPS class via a
charmed pet (and crowd control just for convenience because most groups
don't bother to single-pull).

Sure, doing easy content, any of the archetype is unnecessary.  Shamen are
fine healers for LDoN, and Rogues can tank them.  That doesn't disprove the
necessity of the roles for tough fights.  In easy content there's a
LOT of slack.

Even in hard content, there are tactics which can make up for lack of one of
the 4 requirements.  They're still the commonly-needed parts of a normal
mid-high end xp group.
