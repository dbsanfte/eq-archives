Perhaps that's how it registers an item's "demise" when it is thrown.
It is essentially removed from existance and converted to a DD effect
when it comes down to it. Even if the logs had registered it as
"thrown", she wouldn't have gotten it back. All she would have gotten
was advice to be more careful with items in the range slot next time.

( How do you accidentally throw something in your range slot? If I've
got something there I want to keep, I sure as hell don't keep the
range attack hotkeyed on that character... if someone does, then
that's definately their own damn stupidity at work. I can't think of
any other way besides maybe mis-clicking while setting up attack keys
on the "main" menu )
