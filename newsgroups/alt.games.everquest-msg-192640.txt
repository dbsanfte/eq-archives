I play a level 60 Enchanter & level 50 Druid as my main characters.  I
can definately relate to your concerns over looting.  Casters always
get the short end of the stick, especially at lower levels..  The
groups I've enjoyed the most are those where the looting occured based
upon the alphabetical listing of names in the group.  Autosplit was
turned off & when your name came up, you received all of the loot off
that mob.  The problem with autosplit is it splits the number of coins
not the total value of the coins.  So if there is only 1 pp the person
looting will get the 1 pp every time & the lower coins will be split
among the others, but not in equal values.

I normally ask politely what the looting rules are in a group before I
join them.  If there are no rules, I often times don't join or if I do
join, I don't play with them very long.
