Agreed. I believe on the nVidia newsgroup they regularly post the best
method for removing all traces of Voodoo drivers, and you might even find
them on the nVidia website. I was lucky to not have to face this situation,
I upgraded mobo, CPU and video card all at once, which made backing up and
totally reformatting my hard drive a sensible procedure (especially since
the new mobo ran my ATA-100 drive natively, instead of through a PCI card).

Good luck, should you attempt the video swap again.
