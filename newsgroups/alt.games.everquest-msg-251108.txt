There is a fairly safe route to Cobalt Scar, through PoMischief.  It
drops you in the water in the middle of CS.  The only running you have
to do is from the book at the north end of the zone to the south end
of the Great Divide.  It's not a short run, but it's only one zone. 
The real pain is getting back though, as it is one-way.  Bring gate
potions.
