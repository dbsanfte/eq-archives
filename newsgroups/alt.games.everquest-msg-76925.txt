It depends on your personality, I suppose.

Some folks really love Necros up till about level 40 or so.  The claim is that
they can usually solo yellows.

I play an enchanter (and a bard), and am having quite a lot of fun with that.

My wife plays a wizard and she often groups with my enchanter.  Oddly enough,
this dual caster group works pretty well, at least to the level we're at
now (about level 15).  We regularly take down yellows together.
Solo I can take down whites but it takes nearly all my mana and often kills
my pet in the process.  My enchanter isn't twinked though, so his mana pool
isn't that deep (INT about 134).  I may not be using the best tactics, though,
as I'm still fairly new to the class.  Right now I stick to soloing blues to
give me some room for error.

I don't know much about mages except that the get some pretty awesome pets.


I'd guess about the easiest pure caster is a wizard, since their line of spells
is pretty much limited to direct damage.  Not many buffs, debuffs, or 
miscellaneous spells, and no pets till level 29 where they get a familiar
(new to Luclin).

If you want to consider a hybrid class, I recommend bards!  They are a blast
and with the right tactics you can solo a swarm of mobs and level really fast.
www.eqdiva.com is a good resource for that class.  But they are harder to play,
and definitely not recommended for those with carpal tunnel.

Have fun!
