North Karana, which would mean a trip through East Karana, Highhold, 
Kithicor, West Commons, East Commons, North Ro and finally Oasis. Try 
buy a port to North or South Ro, it will save you a lot of time.

Although its very dangerous, that first journey across Antonica is a lot 
of fun and you will remember the experience if you haven't done it before.

I'd just try make it to level 16 or 17, then head off to Paludal for 
easy levelling to around 25. The bandits there drop plat on occasion, 
and drop bronze brigadine which you can usually sell to merchants for a 
few plat per piece. If you want to make decent plat after that stage you 
can head off to Everfrost and hunt Mammoths. Their tusks can be sold to 
merchants for 8-9pp (not sure whether the Halas merchants will like you 
though).
