While what you're saying is true, it's hardly a major problem.  One, if you
have a fairly good meditation skill (not hard to get) it doesn't take very
long to get your mana back.  Two, BLs don't use that much mana... unless
you're killing red or yellow cons you can play quite easily with 20m or
less.  Three, you have to do all that stuff every time you zone anyway, so
unless you're staying in one zone the entire time you play it doesn't matter
all that much.  You can still get just as much done with a BL in a half-hour
playing session as you can with most other classes.  Most casting classes
use so much mana that the downtime from medding after a fight takes up as
much or more time than a BL will use summoning and buffing pet at login and
when you zone.  Also it's pretty easy to sit and med while your pet fights
blue cons if you really want your mana but you want to kill things while you
get it back.  I usually melee with my pet until I get to about 30% HP, then
I go and sit down to med mana and HP, just standing up periodically to buff
pet when he loses buffs, heal him when he gets hurt, and heal myself some to
raise my HP (I med mana a lot faster than HP).  Sitting can get you aggro
but if you stay out of range of wandering KOS mobs and let your pet hold
aggro you'll be fine.
