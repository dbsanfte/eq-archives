quillmane's cloak is the most boring of all the mage epic camps.  the plane
of air, provided you assemble a strong raid force that is willing to take
out a saturday/sunday just to be in sky and is committed to going to that
island.... is really not *that* hard.  again, assuming that you have the
raid force and levels and gear and appropriate classes, you should be able
to get through bee island, which is arguably the hardest island in sky.
also, the crowns can be traded and sold, so it can always be purchased.

imho, the hardest part is the earth staff.  random three day spawn, still a
uncommon/rare drop off the magi p'tasa... on the server i am on, there are
about nine magicians who just have earth staff left.  i think that says
something as to the rarity and difficulty of obtaining one...

fortunately, i was able to remove myself from that list a few weeks ago :)
uubober is quite nice, yes...
