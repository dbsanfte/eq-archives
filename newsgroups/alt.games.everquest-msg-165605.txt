I am certain Azureake sees invis, he also seems to path right across the
Dragon Portal, is low 50's.
He's not that common, prolly only seen 3 times in about 50 visits to CS but
if you see a message he's attacking you don't wait around to find out what
he is, just run and then decide if you want to take a shot at him.
