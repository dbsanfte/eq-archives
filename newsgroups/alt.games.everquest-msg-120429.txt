Hmmm ... the exact thing happened to our wizards too. We had a wipeout 
in HoT. After guild died and mobs went away, me and the monks started 
dragging to a safe spot, I rezzed the cleric and he started to rez the 
others. But 2 of the wizards were LD .. hmm. Ok, we wait a bit then they 
come on as an alt just to say that the moment they try to enter ToV 
(being bound outside in WW) they crash to server select. Very annoying. 
They petition, server GM shows up after a while, summons wizard corpses 
to us but they still cant get in. The only solution was to rollback 
their chars to a previous backup :( Heh, being in the nuke team they 
were not happy at all, lost some good xp.

Very annoying.
