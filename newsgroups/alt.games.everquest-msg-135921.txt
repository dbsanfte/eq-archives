Has anyone bought EQ gold ?(EQ, Kunark, Velious, and Luclin in 1 box)
I just got a copy from my 'friendly' Game store and opened it to activate my
2nd account only to find that all the CDROM's were loose in the box, and
there was a distinct lack of serial numbers. The lack of cases is not really
an issue as this is now a 2nd set of CD's for me, but does EQ Gold get a
serial number online after installation? or do I go to the shop and flame
them? I find it strange that there is a store security tag stuck to the
INSIDE of the box.(which, by the way, WAS Shrink-wrapped)

Has anyone else bought EQ gold that could fill me in with the serial number
issue please?

<Grumble>
