Fo7 more good for players than a pure mana regen?

HP 544
STR 75
DEX 75

No mana regen at all.

Versus

250 mana pool
14 mana per tic
25 int
25 wis

For a warrior, monk, or rogue Fo7 is clearly better.  These people only 
buy KEI when doing trade skills, though.

For a pure caster, though, HP matter little, STR and DEX even less; how 
often do you see necromancers, mages, enchanters, or wizards hitting 
things with weapons over level 10 or so?  Only the HP part is at all 
interesting

For shaman, the stats are nice, HP translates to a bigger mana pool in a 
way (although note that KEI also gives bigger mana pool), and they 
sometimes do bother hitting things with weapons, although there's rarely 
any real point.  For a cleric, that Dex can really mean something, in 
terms of getting their hammers to proc, which is really what cleric 
melee post 56 is about, the damage they do from actual melee is as low 
as you might expect, but a high proc rate can generate some decent 
numbers.  For a druid... maybe the str would help them carry more loot home?

Hybrids might benefit more from Fo7 than from KEI... but perhaps still 
not; knights who are playing MT actually use a fair amount of mana 
(small amounts but spent constantly), often out of quite tiny pools, and 
are rarely accorded any med time at all, Beastlords have it worse as 
they have useful high level spells to blow mana on, if the mana is 
available.

That leaves bards.  Bards get only the mana pool and int increase 
benefits from KEI, on the other hand they don't spend a lot of time 
getting hit (HP part) or hitting things with proccing weapons (dex part) 
either.

So far, there's already a slight edge to KEI, its the more useful of the 
pair to more classes.

But there's a deal breaker: Fo7, like Focus and HOS and the HP talisman 
line, overwrite a series of self buffs; for pure casters, the Shielding 
line, for clerics, the Blessed Armor of the Risen line.  Hybrids, I 
don't know, perhaps not.  At any rate, this means that Fo7 trades me 544 
hp plus useless 75 str and 75 dex for (at the high end of the line) a 
350 hp, 39 AC (admittedly useless) an 40 MR buff; top end casters only 
gain 194 hp and lose 40 MR from getting Fo7

Clerics suffer most of all though, as their buff is 450 hp, 36 AC (a 
stat they may actually use) and 8 mana per tic (lesser version at 58 is 
6 mana per tic)... Fo7 instead of KEI means 94 extra HP, 75 extra dex, 
at the cost of 250 mana, 25 wis (quite often clerics wear gear that is 
25 wis short of the cap, since they normally have KEI on, and there are 
plenty of other stats they can pursue, such as Dex gear and HP gear and 
STA gear and clicky gear) and a whopping 22 mana per tic in regen, 
between losing KEI and Armor of the Zealot both.

Fun eh?

Splendid
