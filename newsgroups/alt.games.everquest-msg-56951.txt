*sigh* You come in here to point out something that a brain dead lemur on
crack figured out from day one. Get a fucking clue already.

Something any grade schooler could have put together.

Sure I can. Warriors have the most HPs. If you decide to set up a
bona-fide uber-tank you're going to go make yourself an Ogre warrior,
you'll max his STR to 150, drop a few points in DEX to get it to 75, then
dump the rest into STA, ending up somewhere in the 142(?) range. Later in
life this warrior is going to have 200 STR and 200 STA. Now. Name an SK,
of any race, that will match this warriors HP level for level? Go on, name
one.

The flamers look at these statements of yours and just say one word:

Duh.
