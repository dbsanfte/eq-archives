Helps with quests also.
Hotkey1 = text to say for questNPC1
Hotkey2 = text to say for questNPC2
Hotkey3 = item given by questNPC1
Hotkey4 = item given by questNPC2

There are certain quests I sometimes do where this is almost a must. Mainly
the one given by the two NPCs in the Freeport tunnels, just at the end
before you emerge out into the East Freeport dock area.
