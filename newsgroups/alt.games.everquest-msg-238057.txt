From the shadows, the mysterious Annie Benson-Lennaman
<anniebenlen@stopthevoices.yahoo.com> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>Nice first post, btw.  Welcome to usenet.

You should know better, Annie. This most likely IS "Lonely Guy", and
none of the posts from either of them are anything other than
trollbait, sent in cowardly fashion from sockpuppet identities. The
stories aren't real, and socks are the lowest form of trolling, not
worthy of responses.
