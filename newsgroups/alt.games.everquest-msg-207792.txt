And of course Clerics will continue to carry their epic for the clicky 
rez.  When I acquired my epic at the ripe age of 56 it was already sadly 
outdated as a weapon, I had three better things I could carry around if 
I wanted resists or melee or a proc (heck there's no proc at all on the 
thing, just the clicky).  Then they added a summoned weapon that I could 
buy the spell for at the cost of 3pp off a vendor that blew every weapon 
I'd ever seen for cleric melee purposes out of the water, and drop 
spells that were upgrades to that.

I do often still weild my epic at 65, not because its all that great, 
but because the stats and resists aren't terrible and I have the thing 
handy for quickly rezzing the dead without having to search thru the 
bags.  Whenever I melee for any reason though, it goes back into a sack 
like it was an old rusty mace, if I haven't bothered to summon a hammer, 
then I pull out one of those weapons I've carried around since before 
the hammer was in the game, since I never bothered to upgrade them 
(summoned hammer vastly better if I need a weapon and epic is fine if I 
don't)
