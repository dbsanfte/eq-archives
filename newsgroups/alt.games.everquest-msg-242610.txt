I'm a young chanter who hasn't been able to play for a while.  I gave
away my stein when I had to drop out.  Now I'm back and want to re-do
the quest but I can't find Kimble to get the regurgatonic.  I found
him last time in the zoo by the furnace at the end of the moat along
the front of the animal cages.  All that is there now is a clockwork
spider.  I got there at night on Thursday (EQ time) and stayed til
Friday at 2 in the afternoon assuming that he would show up for work. 
He never popped.  Is there something I can do to trigger him or is
there some schedule he is on or has he moved.  Can anyone tell me
anything about this guy or have any speculation on what I can do? 
Many thanks for any advice.
