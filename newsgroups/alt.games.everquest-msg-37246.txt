	The equivalent of this happens all the time, actually; Monty Haul gaming
isn't exactly "rare".

	So go ahead.  No one can take away your right to plunge headfirst into the
buggy train-ridden deathtraps that are EQ dungeons.

	Oh, what's that?  No one wants to go with you?

	Well, that should tell you something.  And that something is not "Verant

|City of Mist raids are common, Droga raids are rarer than hens teeth. 

	The *only* reason CoM is a major target is epic components.  Otherwise it
would be as underutilized as the other dungeons.
