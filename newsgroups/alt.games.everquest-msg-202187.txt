    I just wanted to know if Loam required a camp, or if it was a "random
rare" thing. It sounds like The Hole has a serious case of Old Chardok-itis:
lots of random rare drops that neatly eliminate the need to go deeper into a
dangerous zone. Placing some proper named spawns in there, cleaning up the
density a bit, and actually FINISHING THE QUESTS THERE would go a long way
towards drawing people back.

    My friend the 65 WAR and I were able to keep most of it clear, but we're
in Elemental planes gear. For example, he was able to tank four unslowed
mobs (three of them blue to 65, one light blue) at once without even putting
much of a dent in my mana pool. You'd also have to be careful if Velketor
was up, as he'd be one hell of an add. But other than those two points, I
think post-June 11th you'd have some great fun there. Set up in the tunnel
between Upper Dogs and the castle, and pull from both areas. There's a few
named sentinels that can spawn in the castle, and they have some pretty
nifty rare drops.
