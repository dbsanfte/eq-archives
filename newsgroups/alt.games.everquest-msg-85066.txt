My main is a 51 dwarvish Cleric.  One big difference between my groups
now and my groups as a newbie is that now, I tend to group with the
same people most of the time.  The main concern at 51 isn't generally
whether or not the people I'm with have fair looting rules.  My main
concern is how likely is it that these strangers are going to get me
killed.  And if I do get killed, how likely are they to abandon me vs.
help with corpse recovery (which is a lot bigger issue at 51 than it
was at 15).

Contrary to popular belief, there are as many bozos at level 15 as
there are at 51.  A bozo is not someone who doesn't know what he's
doing -- there's no bozo prerequisite for being incompetent..  A bozo
is someone who knows what he's doing is wrong or unfair, and does it
anyway.  Like the druid I grouped with who ninja=loots the no-drop
druid-only item, and then appologized because he 'didnt' realize'
there was another druid in the group (if he didn't know, he could have
asked).  Or the guy who at 50+ who claims that he doesn't understand
that ML means only the warrior (or whoever) loots.  I believe that at
15.  not at 50.

Granted, most bozos aren't purposefully dishonest, and rarely steal.
It's much more likely that they will get you killed.  or just waste a
heckuva lot of your time on-line.  

When you are a newbie, you will meet lots of bozos.  You will also
meet a few really great guys and gals.  Add them to your friends list.
If you see them on when you are looking for a group, find out if they
are in a group already, or if they want to join you to start one.   If
you meet several people you like in the same guild, you might ask them
about it, and possibly join yourself.  A guild is a great way of
making more friends.

BTW my first 'regular' group didnt' happen until I joined a guild.
Someone said in guild chat 'who wants to join me in Lake of Ill Omen.
By the weekend, we had almost a dozen people there, in a nearly always
full, rotating group of 6.  We always looted the same way so there was
never any real problems or question,  That was close to a year ago,
and I'm still friends with and group with a lot of those people.
