The silver griffon stomped my head because i had the wrong spells up. He is
unsnarable which means that the druid epic will not kill him. I have some
advice if you are going to fight him:
Throw chloro/regrowth on youself... He has a mean dot.
Have sow or preferably SoE on yourself he is sowed and is not snarable. Have
your dots and nukes up and go at him. I did not kill him, I had to zone into
WK but hopefully this will help others who choose to kill him
