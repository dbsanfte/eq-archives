I think he's showing a little of the Sang K. Choe syndrome here ;)

Another thing is that you want focus effects to be on items it'd be
natural for a benefiting class to use. Aka: not put int caster effects
on wis items or negative int items, not put wis caster effects on int
items, not put either/both kind of effect on items that go on pure
melees in 99 of 100 cases and with no sensible alternatives (the fact
that some of those melees will be hybrids is not enough justification
when the pure int/wis caster can't get the effect at all without
upsetting a lot of melees...), but I already foamed about this in
another post so I'll just shut up now.
