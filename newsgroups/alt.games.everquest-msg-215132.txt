If you're joining a pickup group, then dropping out in under 2 hours, why
did you even go?   Considering it can take 20 minutes to get enough people,
then a half hour to fight down to where you're going...  stay there for 10
minutes then XXXX person say "Sorry guys, gotta go."...  That doesn't fly
too well.

LDoN seems to me to have a maximum time commitment of two hours.   Whereas a
normal group is usually more than that, in my exprience.

I would contend that for the "ultra casual" players who cannot play in any
blocks of time whatsoever...  it's hardly a change.   They won't be grouping
in LDoN, and they also wouldn't have been grouping without it.
