Renux is a triggered mob, trivial.
General is a triggered mob.
Kedge robe is a semi-rare on the Coercer in the same zone.

Wizard epic drop from Phinny is stupidly rare and Phinny is on a 12
(or is it 24 hours) spawn.  I know several of our wizards have camped
Phinny for days on end without success.

Relatively speaking, ranger epic is trivial.
Wizard epic is still a camp-athon.
