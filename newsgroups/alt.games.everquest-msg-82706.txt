Bill, thank you for your informative and rational post.

Of course I know these things, as some Americans do not, but we're all so
used to having it our way that it's hard to change sometimes. As I mentioned
in an earlier post, I REALLY wish I could read them. I have not the wit or
the wisdom, I fear, to learn many other languages than the 2.5 or so that I
know. But I do wish that I did. And of course I know that EQ IS a global
community. Perhaps what is missing, at least for some of us, is another few
NG's. I'm sure they would be much more informative for the people in
question! :) And of course, I know that it's EQ. Period. Never heard of
babelfish -- it's good for translations? I'd love to be able to read posts
that are written in non English! And I will certainly look into it, now that
you have so graciously informed me of its existence. I like to think that
I -can- make everyone feel welcome, I just wish I could do it in their
native tongue ;)

many thanks,
Dark
