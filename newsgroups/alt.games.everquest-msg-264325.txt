I don't know why anyone would be too terribly shocked. This is a new genre 
for Blizzard, and there is no reason to expect them to succeed head and 
shoulders above anyone else who's taken a crack at it. Sure, they've been 
reputable in the past, and I expect no less from them this time around. 
That said, I don't expect perfection.
