What Jakugg said.

All I can say is at 19 I was ganking gargoyles in OOT for major loot (for
that level). Not a good spot for a solo warrior though. It was tough to solo
for a mage at that level. A breeze at 20 with new improved pets. There is
however always at least one other person there and they might agree to
partner with you out of sheer boredom. If there is three people there forget
it. The garg population is not large enough to support three hunters.

Here is what I do to find zones to hunt in. Check out the zone level chart
on Allakhazam. Find zones in your general level range and read the strategy
discussions. Then decide what's best for you. Lake Rathetear might be good.
Can you swim?
