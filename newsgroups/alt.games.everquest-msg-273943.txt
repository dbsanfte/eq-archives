well you know what?

One person (42 iirc) showed the courtesy to actually provide a citation.
This did lead to things some interesting things coming about.

"Pussy" was used as a term of endearment for females and as a term for
effiminent men from 1483.  It was used as a term of endearment for women
through to at least Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin.

This predates the claimed german derivative for pussy to describe vagina by
some 4 centuries, and there is nothing in between arguing or indicating that
used as a term of cowardice (which is the actual point)  did not come from
the original meaning in line with a term of endearment to women - which
certainly wasn't the german word for vulva.

I'll get out the phone book, it looks like you need some serious dental
work.  Where'd your research go BTW?


and FYI "wimp" a much more common term is derived from either Whimpey the
Popeye character or whimper.
