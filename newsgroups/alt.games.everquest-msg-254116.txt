The matching is not on income tax, it's on social security which is a 
fixed percentage up to a cap.  So, raising your income by that amount 
would net you at worst zero, as the government would take it from your 
check instead, at best, some cash, as you hit the cap.  Of course, it 
could be enough to push your income to the next bracket, and raise your 
income taxes as well...
