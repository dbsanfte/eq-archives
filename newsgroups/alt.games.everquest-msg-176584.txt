I have given 3 years of my life to this game.What's the point?In  D&D the DM
had a  plot  to each story.The game had a meaning.What is the meaning to
EQ?It is tiresome,Please no CIHYS cus I got nuthin'.And I'm not so sure Ill
quit.I'm just venting .Don't you look longingly back to the past,the days of
D&D.I think of the night "we" ventured into hell and played the price,Lomax
,Cypress,Acronald,Guard and Kracker.The "solo" games and all the   group
achievements.I wish EQ was as great as D&D.
