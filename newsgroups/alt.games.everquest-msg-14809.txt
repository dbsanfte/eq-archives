There has always been (to my limited experience) a bank, and a merchant as well. I've
used the bank. You just have to be high enough level that nothing in the bank attacks
you. The merchant won't deal with you though due to faction problems. That may go away
now. If you happen to be hunting in the gorge, or even EK, this could be an excellent
choice for evils to bank and shop.
