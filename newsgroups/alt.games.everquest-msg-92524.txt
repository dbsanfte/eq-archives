Can't see any advantage in EQ really (unless you play a bard) depends on how
often you communicate with people I guess. It was helpful in Q3 but I found
no real advantage over using keyboard other than the space saving side of
it. I guess if you had the space to sit it next to a keyboard it may be
better for EQ.

Just a shame it's right handers only (doesn't effect me but does a few
others that have shown interest in them)
I also have found that it often gives a keystuck problem and it also messes
up mouse sensitivity.
As I am not playing any real FPS games online (well MoH but not seriously) I
am not actually using mine at all.
