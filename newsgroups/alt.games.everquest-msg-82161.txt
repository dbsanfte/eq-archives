At this point in EQ's epic life, the script is far more moot than
making this:

1) more doable for customers without them going postal.

2) not cause as many CS problems which then tie up GMS over a
rare and often contested spawn bottleneck.

On the dev board they explain the exact reason why they did
not go for no rent on the box. If they did could go LD after getting
and maybe not reconnect within half an hour (isp problem, etc) POOF no
more box.

Besides that, they want to make it less bottleneck causing. I think
this is a better idea because as they state in the dev board post the
zordokar dragon guy can spawn in skyfire every few days or "sooner
when the server goes up."  This is good because every guild who has a
cleric somewhat near can be called there if its up and then that
cleric will have the box getting out of the way. The fact that you
don't have to watch and count when nagafen dies, clear out firegiants,
etc means that for most people the one in skyfire will be a "check on
sometimes" mob instead of a "camp for 72 hours marathon contested
spawn mob."

I'm quite pleased myself. I'm a druid and after seeing what clerics in
my guild have had to go through what with the firegiants, contested
spawns, staying up for days, etc. The quest now is very near what some
of my suggestions (and I'd guess many customers, and probably the
quest designers themsevles) were in a letter I wrote to the dev board
pointing out the obvious bottlenecks with the cleric epic and
comparting it to the druid one (VSR and such spawns in particular) I
pointed out that though at first VSR was kind of tough because every
druid had that bottleneck so he was rapidly pounced on, eventually it
ironed itself out and everyone new doing the quest relaxed. Where as
one time we had a line in my guild for VSR and would jump him ASAP,
now everyone and his brother seems to have that part and he's up for
quite a while most times. 

The cleric one is actually more friendly in some ways because in the
druid one VS regular has to die first. In the cleric one nothing has
to die for the guy to pop up in Solb you exchange your pearl for the
swirling one to, he spawns once a day, nothing has to die for the
zordak guy to pop up in skyfire. 

Most guilds I know what just go kill it willy nilly either but will
instead only bother for clerics at that point = every cleric at that
point right now who had the guild power to get it the old solb way
gets it within a month or so probably, with much less aggrivation to
all. Then it should work even smoother for new people doing the quest.

Epics are the best if several of the last parts have several seperated
day steps instead of 2 steps at the same time, it just spread it out
better. This way the cleric will be able to do the pearl part once a
day and only a cleric with the people on to get the skyfire one will
be able to do that. Another important thing is that because you don't
turn in a pearl to spawn the dragon in skyfire, its anyone's mob who
gets there first with a sufficient force. 

A cleric from my guild and my guild were waiting in solb for the guy
to spawn, we had a sufficent force. Because we had cleared the way and
were there .. another cleric and an insufficient force from here guild
where there also waiting. She was faster and turned it in first, then
she and her people got smoked (and some of us since we could not fight
it or be ksing, besides helping would only encourage that kind of
bastard behavior) She did it in desperation and selfishness basically,
after they all died they did manage to get another uber guild from our
server to come help her (the other uber guild later apologized to my
guild when they heard how it went down) Because of verant's "whoever
turns in pearl gets ragefire since you don't get pearl back" policy,
our hands were tied as soon as she spawned it.

Now it will work completely differently and eliminate that problem.
The way it works now if we were there in skyfire and knew they did not
have a sufficient force we'd just take it. If we were there and knew
they did not have a sufficient force and they engaged it we'd shout to
zone "okay, if you die we are engaging next." No one has their quest
crippled since nothing makes it spawn and its anyone's game like any
dragon.
