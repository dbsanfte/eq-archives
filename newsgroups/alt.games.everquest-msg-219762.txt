I am running an ATI 9800Pro with the 3.8 cats 2xAA 8XAF....No problems
for me. I am using EQW to run in windowed mode. I don't switch between
full and windowed. I run my desktop at 1280x1024 and EQ at 1280x960.
The EQ window fills the screen but still leaves the Windows tool bar
visible at the bottom of the screen. Perhaps that is why I don't have
any issues?
