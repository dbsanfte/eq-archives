Ouch .. I have tried that too, but luckily that was on an early level (mid
twenties in Unrest .. they used their undead nuke and didn't want to heal).

I have seen many good Clerics lately on the other hand ... last night me
(level 49 Warrior), a level 50 Enchanter and a level 54 Cleric held the King
room in Lower guk Live side for a few hours only the three of us - Never
even saw the enchanter with low HP, even though she charmed mobs ... kickass
Cleric, he rooted the messed MOBs so teh enchanter didn't get them on her
when a mes broke and used stun & root when we had a runner.

Any class can be good, if the person playing it is good !
