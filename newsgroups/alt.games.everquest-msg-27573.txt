If you keep this one thing in mind then I'll GUARENTEE you that you won't be
hated:

Unless you're grouped with someone, YOU ARE NEVER ENTITLED TO A DAMNED
THING, SO DON'T ASK FOR STUFF.

Don't ask for cash.  Don't ask for items.  Don't ask for "buffs" (beneficial
spells).  Do your own work and you'll be respected.  Beg for crap and be
hated.  You decide.
