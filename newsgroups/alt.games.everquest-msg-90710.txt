If someone who has experience with the Beastlord class... (that means
beyond level 40)   where do beastlords come into their own.
From what Ive seen here...   Warrior, Pally, SK = Tank
			Roge, Monk, Ranger= Damage dealer
			Cleric, Shammy, Druid = Priest class
etc etc etc...
so where does a Beastlord stand..  do they act as a meat shield?, deal
the damage,?  more of a support class?

Where would a group neen/want the beastlord class?
I have had minimal experience with the class... Ive grouped with maybe
2 or 3 and those were with my lower alts.

Your time is appreciated.
