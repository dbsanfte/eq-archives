Over the last 2+ years there has been a LOT of "flexibility". Just
look at some of the major changes and improvements. 

Hybrid exp penalty removal was a HUGE change.

The game we play today is 1000% better than what hit the shelves 2+
years ago. Not only that, it has stayed true to the "vision", even
when that "vision" has been forced to evolved and change.

I am not saying EQ or Verant is perfect. Bad decisions and stupid
mistakes have happened along the way. In the end the good far
out-weighs the bad.

Cheers
