Lol - sorry, I tinker.

What resolution do you usually run in?

I run mine at 1280x1024, but the /viewport
command makes it so it doesn't draw the
view on all the surface. 

if you close all the ui windows,
/viewport 0 0 1280 770 lets it draw all
the stuff in a space that's 1280 pixels
wide (the width of the screen) and 770
pixels high, leaving a black strip at
the bottom.  This way it only draws 3/4
as many pixels. 

Then you put the chat window and stuff
at the bottom, where they aren't layed
over the stuff being drawn.

Mods are things that change the new UI's
windows around abit.  You can find some
at www.eqinterface.com  (And plenty of
people that know about it).  The
particular mods I use make a few windows
smaller.

Finally, the new models that came with
Luclin are more detailed, and put a higher
load on your system than the ones that
came with EQ originally.  Also, when you
installed Luclin, you had the option to
install new textures for the old zones in
the original EQ, Kunark and Velious.  These
also put a higher load on your system.  I don't
know of any way to get rid of those textures
once they are installed (and SoL installs them
by default).  

At the screen where you usually select "Connect"
select "Options" instead - there's a screen there
that allows you to select which races you want
to see as the new models, and which as the old
ones.  You can turn them all off - go to the
character select screen and choose create new
character and look at each race to see which ones 
you absolutely HAVE to have as new models.
