I just hit lvl 30 and have only been to Luclin, CB and HHK and want to
expand my travels.  I have heard that I should go to the Overthere now and
want to bounce this past you guys.  I know that I can port to the dreadlands
in Kunark and travel through the mountains and then go to either LOIO or
Overthere from there but have some safety questions.  First should I plan on
traveling camoflauged so that I am safer?  In either zone where should I
bind as I am currently bound in HHK and if I die along the way that would
really suck to get my body back.  Which zone do experienced members think is
better for exp and plats for my character.  Thanks in advance for your help
