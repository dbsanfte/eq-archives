In my Iceclad experience (I spent several levels there), dire wolves have
the best quad.  They give good experience, bunch very nicely, didn't resist
much, and they're social fighters, which means that only a lone wolf that is
low on health will try to run away.  They were GREAT fun, but their loot
SUCKS.

Try to get 4.  Three is fine, but 4 is more mana efficient.  I agree with
the previous poster to try with 2 or 3 to get comfortable.  But overall, you
seem to have the right quadding idea.

Lastly, forget the yellow chickens.  There are many more dark-blue
quad-kiteable mobs in Iceclad than yellow chickens in OT at any time. Plus,
quadding is much more fun. =)
