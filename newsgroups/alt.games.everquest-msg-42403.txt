>> Why do the online RPG's need a monthly payment to play? <<

I've only played EQ, no other MORPG, so I only know about EQ. But, I'll
break a few things down for you.

I play every weekday for about 3 hours a day. On the weekends, I play for
about 10 hours. That means I'm playing about 140 hours per month. I pay
about $10 a month for the service. That works out to about $.07 an hour.
That's not a bad price.

Plus, they are constantly patching the game. For Free. They added two new
zones. For Free. The GMs will occasionally run a quest where you can get an
unique item. For Free. They hold tournaments where you can earn a title. For
Free.

You mention Diablo Online. Diablo has 6 quests per act IIRC. Also, if
someone else completes that quest, no one else can. In EQ, there are
hundreds of quests, at all different levels of the game. And they can be
done by several people, or even the same person, over and over. I think that
is worth paying for.

In the end, it boils down to this: if you don't want to pay, then don't. No
one is forcing you to. But I think you will find it well worth your
investment.
