Yes, but the Pharm Club likes to kill reavers, so I can never find the
fucking things uncamped except for 3 am Wednesday night when everyone in my
guild is asleep.

As a side note I didn't get my stone because a druid in my guild who said he
was quitting and hasn't been on for 2 months (but has everything else for
the half epic) showed up and said he needed it (and the other stone had
already been merited).  ARGH.
