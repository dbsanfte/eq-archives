Heh - got to agree with you.  My usual group includes our guild's most
effective raid leader (ranger/cleric 2 box) and our loot officer (she 
does HUGE amounts of work during raids /em doffs hat in great respect
to Tsuga Onerio).  Me, I'm only bossy during the CoH bridge.  And the 
people who can't adapt to an odd situation sure showed themselves last 
night.  We'd finished the 4 BoT bosses, and were taking a smaller force
to pick up a few more ST keys (Kland/Sont/LTK all up).  While I was at
the ToV entrance waiting for folks to get through SG, someone trained
Crial to ToV, where he got stuck in a wall.  Naturally I couldn't have
a necro or the other mage (KoS) there.  I issued very explicit instructions
in the raid channel - "Face due north before being summoned - you will
be looking directly at the pillar, click it and zone in immediately."

Pretty clear?  Well, let's just say they worked for some people, not
others.  The ones who immediately TURNED AROUND on landing and ran all
over, while I (with no buffs - all dispelled) am getting hammered by
the AOE.

Again and again I issued these instructions.  One guy even ran all over
the place and DIED.  We had to SC him to SG, rez him and re-coh him and
he almost died again.  Even on the second try, the first thing he did on
landing was TURN.  I was dropping them due south of the pillar for 
christ's sake!  Some people zoned in so fast that Crial never even said
anything, much less AE'd - because they could do something different.

Sorry, had to vent.  I stayed up late to bridge in for these kills, and it
ruined an otherwise great raid night for me.
