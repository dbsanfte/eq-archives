    Well, qualified: if EK isn't "open" and you aren't a killing machine. In
Upper Guk there's a four spawn of spiders close to Dead Side Lower zone, and
ten spiders in the area near Scryer. If someone calls "spiders" on my
server, then it's usually assumed they're doing them all if higher level.
Between those 14 spawn points, which repop every 16 minutes, you're going to
get maybe a silk per spider average. That's a stack of swatches per hour.

    Now, to explain my caveat. Buddy of mine is a 60 Rogue with a taxi-druid
on a second computer. HE went to East Karana, at a time when spiders weren't
being actively camped by another high-level character. With the taxi for
tracking and SoW he was able to clear EK at a phenomenal rate, without
downtime. So he was able to do better than the roughly one spawn per minute
you get in Upper Guk. People with items like a right-click DD robe, or other
melees with access to tracking, will likely find EK a better place to gather
silks. You also can buy silks from others in EK.
