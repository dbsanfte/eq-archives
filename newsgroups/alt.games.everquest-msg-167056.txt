The RM giants are the same as the NK and WC and SRo and Oasis giants as far
as difficulty goes.  You've got ports to 3 of those zones, and Oasis is a
very short run from SRo, so I'd suggest you pop into those zones and give
them a try.  If they go well, then you can make the trip to RM if you like
giants.
