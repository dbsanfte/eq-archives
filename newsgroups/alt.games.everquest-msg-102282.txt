Abbreviations and shortening words in some cases are fine. But bastardizing
an all ready short word is rather ridiculous. I don't expect every single
person to type "The United States of America" or "National Aeronautics and
Space Administration" consistently because those names took lot longer to
type as opposed to "U.S." and "NASA." However, it's not a hassle to type
"please" in any way.

The "rez" thing probably results from ignorance. Many people don't take the
time to learn the cast time, mana use, or name of spells that are not their
own... they just know the effects. So if they ask for a "rez" they're not
really being specific, but it's rather obvious that it's the highest
possible spell you can cast to restore experience.

As for "PST," that has to be one of the most redundant abbreviations I've
heard. When you consider the way it's used, it's all ready apparent that
someone is going to send you a tell...

"WTS Bone chips, PST."

Send a tell? Well, hot damn! Why didn't I think of that? And I was just
going to carry a conversation with the seller in shout...
