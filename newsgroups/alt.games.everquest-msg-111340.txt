LOL, I wish I often spent 5k on anything  :-)  I didn't really consider the
implications of that... Consider me rebuffed.

I did indeed miss the part about not needing to be shown an item in a trade
window, I mostly agree with that.  I read your post and thought you meant
that you would never ask for stats, regardless.  I agree that it's not
necessary to put items in a trade window, although sometimes I would rather
just click a few times instead of typing out the whole range of stats for an
item with a lot of resists and stats.  Sure, typing out "14 dmg, 27 delay"
isn't much, but if an item has a lot of stats or a wide range of resists,
plus weight, size, usable race/class, it can get pretty long.
