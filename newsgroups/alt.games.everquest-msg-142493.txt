Yep. Yours bombed on exactly the same spot mine did. And a bunch of
other aspiring wizards at Graffe's. Are we screwed? I don't *think* we
are, but who knows? It's been reccomended that I go do the early parts
of the shaman epic (if that's even possible) to get more truspirit
faction hits and try again.


But anyway, it's broke now, and still no confirmation from VI about it.
I spent two nights with "elevated" petitions in the queue waiting to
talk to a GM about it and gave up. I'm just dropping it entirely for now
until I hear further on it. But of course, if I get a shot at Phinny or
VS's staves, I'll grab 'em. But until this part is fixed, we can't do
the BG in Fear anyway.
