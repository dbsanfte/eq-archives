Dunno I currently have 512 MB DDR but this is with a completely new
computer...So I can't really say. + I haven't played EQ much lately...

I can get 3 gigs of memory on my board...3 slots, with 1 giga mem each (yes
its DDR but has ECC so its slower I believe I will have to look into it
more...)

I can get three 512 MBs of DDR mem into it but I doubt I will do it anytime
soon...no real reason I suppose. (one GB is a lot of memory how many games
require that? None....)
