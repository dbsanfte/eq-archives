Not true, sit and I mean sit at the Druid rings in in Karana and wait for a
bear or wolf to wander by (won't work if you're a druid, obviously) The
druids there act just like Holly, attack or get aggro'd by a wolf or bear
and see what happens, as will the treants. Treants will also attack you if
they catch you aggro'd by or killing bears in WK as well.

The Druids in commons do not seem to act like this, I can't comment on the
ones in EK as I don't believe any mobs in that zone fall under their
protection. Can't think of any other rings that have druids with them.
