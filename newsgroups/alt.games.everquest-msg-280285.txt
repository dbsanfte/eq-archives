Actually, I am pretty sure that if you read the fine print of what you 
agreed to you will find that they are within their rights to change the 
fee.  Would not surprise me if they also left themselves the option of 
correcting any billing errors explicitly, although I don't believe that 
is necessary.

From a customer service standpoint, it might be better if they did not 
change the rate and assume that everyone got the notification, but 
rather, stopped billing and suspended service until such time as the user 
explicitly agreed to the new rate.  From a legal point of view, I'd be 
surprised if they did not specifically state that the rates are subject 
to change in order to cover themselves.
