That's true (though its 14/18 with 4 magic, which in practice comes
out to about 16/18 not 18/18). But consider this: a ranger using
elemental weapons like that comes in dead last of all the dps classes
(rogue, monk, beastlord, ranger, wizard, necro, magician) and second
last only ahead of paladin when it comes to all damage-dealing melee,
pet, and nuking classes in dps. Behind even warriors!

Forcing rangers to get a single weapon from a GoD upper end zone is
not a valid way to address this balance problem. For the record, when
I talked to a dev about this a week or so ago he agreed that ranger
melee was not where they wanted it to be.

The parses are not bearing that out.
