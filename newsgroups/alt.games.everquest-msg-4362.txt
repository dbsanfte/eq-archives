I've been playing a high elf mage for awhile (among others) and have
gotten him to level 12. Up to now, I've been mostly naked. I find that
I get bogged down REAL easy if I wear too much armor, so I decided to
just ignore it altogether unless I get some armor with some beneficial
magical properties (like +int or something). So far, I have two
earrings (both +2 int), and a robe (+5str, +5sta, +2int +?
svpoison...given to me by some wandering stranger...still don't know
his name), but that's it. Is it smart to run around mostly naked,
considering I'm a mage, and will probably rarely have to tank, except
to distract from my pet occasionally? If it is in fact as stupid as I
think it might be, then what kind of armor should my High Elf Mage
look for? I'm just now getting to the point where I might be able to
afford some really good stuff. ANyway, thanks for any help that you
can give.
