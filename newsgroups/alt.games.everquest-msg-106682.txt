Seems to me that twinking should be defined better, or better yet some
new terms coined.

My new shaman is twinked and twinked big time, not everything mind
you, so lots of room for the search for new stuff. When I started him
I wasn't going to do it, but damn, I've been there and done that
(snakes,bats, and rats). I want to get through that stuff as soon as
possible. I want to move on. Still have to earn the levels myself,
still have to learn my chars abilities, still alot of fun.

Self twinker, one who works hard at skills, for example, shops till
they drop to get those good deals and uses said items for lowbie char.
Very easy for them to have things another, not going this route, won't
have. I actually wouldn't even call this twinking, but think some
might.

Friends/guild twink you, well you can always say no. Heh, I don't
wanna be rude though ;-)

Hand me down twinker, high level char transfers the goodies/plat via
friend to new char.

Probably other ways to do it. Bottom line, to each their own. What
ever makes/helps you enjoy the game. The freedom of choice in this
game world is one of the big draws for me.
