only 2 expansion packs are innappropriate in content for new players.....the
game goes from level 1 to level 65, and 2 expansions are 30+

install them all though

for advice......without spoiling anything for yourself, go to
eq.crgaming.com and look at the 1page introduction to all the classes

you might know exactly what you think you want to do, but the best attempt a
new player can make to understand the game is to learn at least a little bit
about other classes

picking a new server like Stromm would probably be a good idea, since on
most other servers, people have a 4 year headstart

on Stromm people aren't new, for the most part, they're just poor =)
........if you started playing there, you would be able to catch up very
quickly since everyone else is working themselves up (from scratc) also

best of luck!
