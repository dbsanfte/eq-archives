You can sort of trick the patcher to DL large portions of SOL or POP.
It involves going into that EQconfig.xml file and putting to YES
update the textures, then later changing it to NO don't update the
textures. One or the other makes the zone files download instead of
having to update them from the cd, or the thing say:

"download limit exceeded." 

If it says that, try it the otherway in the XML file.

I redownloaded 150 meg or so when I did not feel like getting out the
CD again.

How the heck do people "lose" their eq cds so often? They are usually
in those big things called "CD CASES" and "GAME BOXES."  You people
make me paranoid like I should make backup copies and put the
originals in a safety deposit box because the CD Loss Gremlins will
come and have their way with me.
