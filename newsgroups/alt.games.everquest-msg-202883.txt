** Quests and Tradeskills **

- Bankers - There were a few quests that required giving an item to a
banker.  When
we recently removed the ability for characters to give items to bankers
to help
prevent mistakenly losing items, those quests became unavailable.  We
have moved
those quests to new NPCs.  If you see any other quests that ask you to
give something
to a banker, please use /bug and report it to us.

Does anyone know the name of the new NPC in High Keep that takes the key
formerly turned in to the banker?
