Out of those I would say the second choice.
Personally I would go:
Warrior, Shaman, Bard, Enchanter

Warrior for his tanking
Shaman for dots/slows/tanking if need be
Bard for healing, melee, DoT, mana regen, speed, blah blah blah
Enchanter for more DoTs, crowd control, clarity, haste

Ive always been big on DoT's.  Throw a few on a mob and let the tank beat
on it, itll be dead before you know it.
