Thanks Handy.

Some other questions also, for anyone that has the time to help.

I talked to a NPC and when I tried to talk again she asked what I'd
like on my tombstone, standard reply from some NPC's. Am I right that
as I go up in levels these people will be more inclined to talk to me?

I made the trip to Qeynos from Surefall Glade without a problem, well
kinda. Did this because of lack of food to buy at Surefall. Is it just
a few classes that are left alone from raoming bad guys or is this a
standard type trip along the highways and byways? Or was I just damned
lucky? If it hadn't been for the kindness of a stranger I'd have been
out of food, something I won't forget. This search for food is pissing
me off. I mean come on whats with no eats at the Glade. ;-)

I want a backpack or pouch badly. I am assuming these items will help
me carry more goodies. Am I right? If I'm not what to do about this.
Major pain in the butt getting one item from a loot and running back
to sell it and repeat and repeat and repeat and......

I've only met a few people so far. All very very nice, what a pleasent
surprise. Now one person made me a bow and gave me 50 arrows besides.
I have them on my char in the proper slots. The picture of my char
shows him equiped with the bow, no problem. He also has a sword in a
slot. Can I assume the game knows when to use the proper weapon? Or
should I have my combat screen up and pushing the correct button, in
this case melee and ranged (I think)?

I'll find out about banks tonight I hope.

Yeah I found out about getting the practice points and did so first
thing I got them. Can I train at some other areas or must I always go
back to my Guild in the Glade?

Now I can't afford a fishing pole yet and I sure as hell can't afford
getting stuff to practice making arrows and bows. Baking kinda looks
cool as well. So what to do and how do I get this stuff rolling. I saw
a merchant with a book for sale for the Bowyer skill. If I buy one
does that start me? How many skills of this type can I take on or is
it resticted by class?
