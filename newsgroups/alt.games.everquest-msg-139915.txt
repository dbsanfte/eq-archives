Each game has a distinct set of parameters for the monitor to display. Deus
Ex has a completely different set of criteria than does Warcraft III, than
does No One Lives Forever than does Flight Simulator 2002.

From the technical merits of focus and convergence and luminance, to the
application specifics of color palette and apparant movement. The demands on
the Monitor can range from the miniscule pixel-point level changes necessary
for correct play in Ghost Recon, to the broad, color saturated cartoon-goth
feel of Unreal Tournament. You need to explore how all of those games will
play on an LCD monitor if you are looking to get one.

If all you want to play is one game, and it looks fine on an LCD, more power
to you. But no LCD can meet the expecations of the gamer who demands high
quality from a wide range of games. Do I wish one did? Yes, I'd love a 26"
LCD panel to play Dungeon Siege on.

Sure, ever play at 1600x1200?

LCD's aren't ready for gaming.
