  In addition, you can get them by killing various fish that are found
swimming around many of the lakes and rivers of Norrath.

  However, the easiest way to obtain a bulk supply of fish scales is to buy
them from a vendor that has an unlimited supply of them.  Offhand I don't
know of one that will do business with an Iksar, but I do know there is a
merchant who sells fish scales (along with bat wings, snake scales and
various gem regeants) in the East Commonlands, in one of the houses near
Freeport.  Though an Iksar won't be able to buy them directly, it's not
difficult to pay a newbie or someone else in the area to buy a few stacks
for you if you offer them a small tip.  The scales themselves are very
cheap.

  Hope this helps.
