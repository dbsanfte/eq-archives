My Bard (full FS plate) has been asked for SoW's and Buffs
My Warrior (Full crafted plate and 2 yaks at that time) has been asked for a
heal, this was buy a ranger who was hunting pick claws in HH!!! Hardly a
newbie
My SK in a mixture of Flayed, Charred and Sentient, carrying a Jarsath
battle sword has been asked for a Port (player didn't look like a newbie to
me in his FS and bronze but I guess he may have had friends that helped him
with twinks)

Of course these are rare occasions that have ever happened to my face where,
I'd have thought, it was obvious I was incapable of providing the requested
service. I have, on many occasion, been asked in tells for ports for
whatever reason, on one occasion I was given lip for saying no, ok I only
said "No" and not "No, I am a warrior" but even had I been a wizard or druid
it is surely my right to refuse. Most of the time that person just says ok
and then normally bothers with a /who xxxx and gives me tell with a "sorry"
and a "lol" for asking a silly question.
I never go Anon as I play no classes that can offer buff or service like a
port (still get the occasional "can you spare anything for a newbie?" tells
but such is North Qeynos)
From my experience all the anon's in a zone are 29th Druids, Wizards or
Enchanters that are sick of tells :ï¿½)
