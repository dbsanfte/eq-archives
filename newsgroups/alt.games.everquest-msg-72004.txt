Yeah to a point, for gaming though you can have it even less. Vcache
only really is helping you when you are opening many of the same
documents several times, so it is of pretty much zero help for gaming.
With 384 meg of ram I had mine set for 26 meg now have it way down for
13 meg max. I notice no performance difference between having it very
low or limiting it to 100 meg (which it goes up to with EQ also)

If I had 512 meg I'd probably set it for 20 meg max then scale back
down. With EQ the vcache WILL become as large as you allow it to
stealing valuble memory which would be better used for the game.

Cacheman at www.outertech.com is nice for setting this up
automatically along with presets for gaming and such. Its also nice
because you can see exactly how large your vcache or disc cache gets
and also exactly how much of your perm swapfile you actually use.
