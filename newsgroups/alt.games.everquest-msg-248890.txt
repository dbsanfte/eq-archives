1) That is sort of the point. What do you do expect them to do when a 
foreign army (*yours*) invades *their* contry?

2) What difference does it make what "those guys" would have done? The 
military is held to standards of behaviour. Discipline is the holy 
mantra of the military... without it they're just a bunch of thugs with 
guns... one could even call them terrorists.

1) I wasn't aware the average Iraqi has much of a voice right now. Very 
little of what they think filters down into American press. Where are 
you getting your information?

2) *You* don't sound the least bit outraged about the photos. You merely 
'don't think what those soldiers did is right', but you are outraged by 
the execution. Sounds like your condemning a double standard while 
holding on to it yourself...
