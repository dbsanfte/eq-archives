Hi,
yesterday my guild was raiding Grieg Veneficus the second time. First
time a week ago went absolutely flawless. Yesterday it was a complete
different experience. :P We wiped and BST pets were one of the main
reason. They aggroed before we could Grieg pin into the edge.
Afterwards we had a heated discussion about pets on future raids.
Imho they shouldn't be banned from raids absolutely. I just can't back
up that view with some insights from pet classes or other raiding
guilds. So I'm interested in hearing your opinions on this.


Thanks,
Hagen
