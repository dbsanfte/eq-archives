I've looked at the everhot forge in the dwarf town, felwithe, and rivervale
but I just can't find a hilt mold.  I want to make a skinning knife and this
is the absolute last ingredient and it's driving me crazy.  Maybe I'm not
looking for the right thing.  Does it look like the blade molds? (The
graphic?)  If it does then where the heck do I find one?

Many thanks in advance,
Raven
