I soloed the acolyte anklet quest with my level 15 druid. This is how I did
the drowned citizen part. It should work much better with you level 19
spells.

There are two ways to reach the drowned citizens. Don't use the straight
tunnel with a drop to the pool. Instead, turn right and go throught the
hidden wall. Practice the run back from this point to the EFP zone-out.

When you know the area well, put a damage shield on yourself and dot one of
the citizens. It's important to keep that citizen targeted from now on
because there will be from 3 to 5 running after you.

Run to the straight tunnel. Stop close to the zone-out point. When you see
the citizens appear in the tunnel, you have time to dot yours again before
the group get in melee range.

Melee your citizen until it's dead then zone out. I only had a velium
scimitar so I was usually down to 1 or 2 health bulbs at that point.

Heal, med and buff than go loot the citizen's corpse.

I had to do this three times before I got my skin.
