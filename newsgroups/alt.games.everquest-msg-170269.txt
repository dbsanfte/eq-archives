It does, kind of - make a list in winamp, and EQPlayer will play it.  
What *I* wish is that it'd save the damn directory you were in, and 
display only files that *can* be played.  I've got all my winamp 
playlists in one directory, and it's about 6 directories away from where 
the player starts every time - if it's one of those "EQplayer doesn't 
want to pay attention to my clicks" kind of days, I usually just give up 
and run it silent.
