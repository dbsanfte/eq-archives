I play in 1024x768 and have not trouble at all reading the chat text.
And if that is really that much of a problem, you can set EQ to switch
resolutions between full screen and the spell book screen to it is
always displayed full screen.

My experience is that the chat text is MUCH easier to read against the
parchment backround than against some of the landscape backrounds.
And if it's that much of a problem, it's trivially easy to alter your
chat text color.

Really?  Odd, until about level 20 or so, a good deal of my druids
damage output could be generated from melee, as opposed to at level 51
where if I try to swing at a mob I will more than likely just keep
them cool rather than to do any damaged at all.  This is pretty much
the same for ALL the priest classes.

Oh.  And the people who CONSTANTLY bitch about having to look at the
damned spell book aren't?

I don't hate the book.  I'm indifferent to it at worst.  I just can't
understand why people get so vitriolic over something so incredibly
trivial.
