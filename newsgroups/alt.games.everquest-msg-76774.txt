There are two of them, they are each others enemy (zaza*cough, mumble,
cough* and Ankhe*cough, mumble, cough*) and I have no idea what they are
there for , I don't think they drop anything as I have never heard of anyone
camping them could be wrong..think they are necro's from what I remember but
I have always avoided them (under the advice of others) one is well out the
way in a little cove but I think the other is close to the HG area so it
prolly wasn't intentional.
