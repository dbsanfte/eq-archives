Yes, if my friends aren't online, I solo, or go exploring, or run around
selling Blood of Wolf potions, or do other tradeskills.  If my friends are
online, then I group with them, plus some pickups.  Also, for a shaman in
OT, there is usually no trouble at all finding a group.  I usually get
several tells during the two to three hours I am on asking me if I am
already grouped.
