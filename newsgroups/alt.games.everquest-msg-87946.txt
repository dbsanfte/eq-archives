I gave up in this NG cause too many worship themselves. Ya know what I mean
?

 Funny how months ago you criticize the same things you are so guilty of.
LOL  What a piece of self righteous work you are. The guy had an opinion and
you pounced right on it. Yea, its your newsgroup. Kinda like being queen of
the dump. What an honor. Cmon over to my server and let me slap your ass
around. You prolly a Druid  LOL


 Now, go back to blocking me cause its probably best. I planted trees on my
land to block the view of the neighbors trash too.

P.S.  Canada Skate ? ROFL   whatever.

Have a Nice Day !!!
