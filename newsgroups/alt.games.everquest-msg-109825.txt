Just a follow-up...

I'm not knocking you, 17 days is longer than most news-servers will keep an
article... and the story STILL makes me chuckle :o)

I don't recall the ORIGINAL author... but I seem to recall this story first
appeared soon after Kunark (I know Bizbee had seen it before, he replied
last time this thread came up) so it's pretty old. Every few months it pops
up again on various boards (I think I first saw it on Everlore) and a new
generation of players gets to see it for the first time :o)
