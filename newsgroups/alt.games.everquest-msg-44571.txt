Completely agree. Rarely found any zone where I spent waay more time
running around trying to form sensible group and people fighting
over whatever, disbanding etc .. I loathe LOIO. There have been a few
good groups, but I can count them on a single hand. For Iksar, there's
not too much selection, though.

That can even work for Iksar, if you spend level 18 - 20 or so killing
the named orcs just outside the Highpass zone in Kithicor (Shralok?
Something like that). My Iksar necro got enough faction to enter
Highpass after two levels there.
