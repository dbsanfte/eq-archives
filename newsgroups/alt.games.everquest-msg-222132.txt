Why not?  I specifically said warrior, mind you, because they are
highly dependant on their weapons to maintain aggro.  Getting
stunned means stopping swinging for a bit, seems to me that would
interfere with their already low aggro output, to the detriment
of the group.  I don't think it matters a lot, but I was trying
to think of a case where race was of interest at all.  What the
OP would be doing with 2 warriors in a group I can't say, except
that in pickup groups sometimes you get what you get.

Hmm, so what would you call the person who picks the target but
isn't the MA?  FA (First Assist?)  TD (Target Designator?)  Its
not that common a job, perhaps there's no name for it.  Used to
have a druid that did the same job, since she was root parking
and dotting mobs... she was also puller.  But she'd tell us what
to kill next verbally, by position, she wasn't reliably around to
use assist off of, rather was off somewhere looking for more
things to pull and park.

I agree, don't know how I overlooked putting them on the list. 
And your "puller is MT" bonus means I should really have put
warriors on the list too, despite a clear lack of tools for the
job, if the situation doesn't require any sort of splitting they
have the advantage of not benefiting from sitting during the down
time and are the MT tank most in need of any help they can get in
the aggro department.

Sadly they seem normally to be chained to the group while someone
else pulls, due to their mana and HP output for the down times.

I did mention rogues, and stunt pulling.
