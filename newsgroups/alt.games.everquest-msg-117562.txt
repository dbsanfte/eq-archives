Spirit Tap (lifetap), Vampire Curse (dot/lifetap), Venom of the snake (the
dot), Dooming Darkness (snare), Torbas Mighty Acid Blast (the nuke), Call of
bones (allure upgrade), The Switch slot (my buffs, pet buffs, twitch, heal,
root, whatever I need), Feign Death. I'm 35. We're in Great Divide.

I don't have fear up, because they don't run in a safe direction where we
are currently hunting- they run back into the mess of where we pulled from.
This what bothers me most about fear,- I rarely have an idea of where they
will run. The one time used fear well in a group was with a cleric (who was
nuking), a rogue, and Jakiss. I snared and feared, and the others killed the
mob.

The first four and the last rarely change in my lineup. It was gate before I
could feign, and is gate on all of my casters- so slot 8 is always my escape
spell slot. I haven't had much luck with root/rotting so far, so I usually
run around with the mob chasing, the pet on the mob, and pause and nuke,
after I get it fully dotted. Mob tends to die when the snare wears off. But
then, I have jboots, so it's easier for me to run around.

I have played with screaming terror the one day I tried the treants in SK.
When screaming terror is resisted, run like heck and feign. Perhaps some day
I'll be brave and try other spots like dungeons.
