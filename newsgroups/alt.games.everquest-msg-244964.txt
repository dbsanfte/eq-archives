Shamans have been screwed over by the evolution of the game.  Mitigated
Slows eliminated the one area that Shamans could claim being the King of the
Hill in.  Other than Melee Buffing shamans no longer bring anything to the
game that they can say they are the best at.  BST can do 65% slows and
Shamans 75% but with the screwed up mitigated slowed mobs these number are
essentially the same.  Talking to the Shamans I know, many are close to
leaving the game.  Also in the healing department Shamans are screwed.  They
need to have their healing capabilities tweaked up a bit.  IMO Druids and
Clerics should still be the two dominate healing classes but the Shaman
heals have fallen into the mundane category and need new life breathed into
them.  GoD has screwed the class worst than mitigated slows ever did.  The
relatively fast encounters make slowing almost null and void.  I have read
the official Shaman forums and there have been quite a few good suggestions
for the class.  One is to give Shamans a limited rezzing capability.  After
all, a Shaman is very much tied to the spirit realm yet they have not been
given any ability to call the dead from this realm back to the present.
Also give Shamans Dots that tick off quicker to help them in their offensive
capability.  Reduce the casting time for Malo and Slow for Shamans so the
spells can actually help out in GoD encounters.  Also allow Canni to be cast
on the run and add a duration component to it.  Canni takes too dang long to
cast where as a necro that can do essentially the same thing except theirs
is a canni over time, not just sit and continuously cast Canni.
