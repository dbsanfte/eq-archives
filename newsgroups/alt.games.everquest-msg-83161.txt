BTW Zymyool happens to be the name of my God. As a worshipper of Zymyool, I
take great offence to your usage of the all-mighty's name in Everquest.
Expect to be contacted by a GM concerning this blatant infraction of the
rules!

If you have any doubt as to my sincerity, I can furnish you with a copy of
the Zymyool's Holy Tomb for the low cost of $79.95 (US) +shipping.

Make your check payable to:

Stinkyfinger Inmabutt
14 Underground Way
Rivervale, Norrath 54321

Praise Zymyool!


Lighten up people! Good grief...
