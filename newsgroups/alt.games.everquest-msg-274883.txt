Actually, we know that.  Despite your temper tantrum, we didn't care
that you had been banned - and still don't - and actually applauded
the fact you *had* actually been banned.  Well done, Blizzard!  Then
we went on to laugh at you for being such a pitiful whiner.  What
happened *next* was that Tcells The Brainless tried to argue that the
word "pussy" (when used to mean a "coward") was completely distinct
and separate from the word "pussy" which means "female genitalia". We
all found that quite amusing, and we had some fun - hence the length
of the thread.  We'd effectively forgotten all about you LONG ago,
because no-one cared about your situation in the first place.
