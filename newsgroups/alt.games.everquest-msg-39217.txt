I said "fun", not "effective".  The places I'd say you need someone in
the group with ShowEQ to have fun are places where:

1. Mobs warp, heal up, and then come back.

2. Pathing sucks, so mobs being pulled decide to tour the whole dungeon.

For the above two cases, what you get with ShowEQ is some way to tell
just how bad it is going to be.  Is the buggy mob coming back alone or
just with one or two friends, or is the entire dungeon coming?

3. Places where corpses end up in strange places, either due to corpse
bugs, or due to people going LD and ending up dying nowhere near where
they were when they went LD.

Again, main point of ShowEQ is to assess the situation, so you can
decide to to find and recover the corpses.

4. Fighting in hilly areas where other players are.

The EQ client has a very annoying tendency to not draw other PCs when
they are at a different altitude then you until you get almost on top of
them.  With ShowEQ, the puller can see that the direction he's going is
about to pull the mob right over another party, or the puller can see
that another party is already fighting the mob and not try to take it
from them.  The game is a lot more fun if your party spends more time
pulling and fighting, and less time profusely apologizing for training.

I can't be sure when someone in the party has ShowEQ, but I've suspected
some, and those parties have less instances of having to deal with the
above bugs.

Last version I actually saw (2.something) was map in one pane with the
mobs drawn as dots colored by /con color, and list of mobs in another
pane.  I think they are up to version 3 or 4 now, but I can't think of
any better way to display the information, so it is probably still that
way.
