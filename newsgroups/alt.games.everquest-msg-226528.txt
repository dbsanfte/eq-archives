I like this one:
bloodninja: Ok baby, we got to hurry, I don't know how long I can keep
it ready for you.
j_gurli3: thats ok. ok i'm a japanese schoolgirl, what r u. 
bloodninja: A Rhinocerus. Well, hung like one, thats for sure. 
j_gurli3: haha, ok lets go. 
j_gurli3: i put my hand through ur hair, and kiss u on the neck. 
bloodninja: I stomp the ground, and snort, to alert you that you are
in my breeding territory.
j_gurli3: haha, ok, u know that turns me on. 
j_gurli3: i start unbuttoning ur shirt. 
bloodninja: Rhinoceruses don't wear shirts. 
j_gurli3: No, ur not really a Rhinocerus silly, it's just part of the
game.
bloodninja: Rhinoceruses don't play games. They f*cking charge your
ass.
j_gurli3: stop, cmon be serious. 
bloodninja: It doesn't get any more serious than a Rhinocerus about to
charge your ass.
bloodninja: I stomp my feet, the dust stirs around my tough skinned
feet.
j_gurli3: thats it. 
bloodninja: Nostrils flaring, I lower my head. My horn, like some
phallic symbol of my potent virility, is the last thing you see as
skulls collide and mine remains the victor. You are now a bloody red
ragdoll suspended in the air on my mighty horn.
bloodninja: Goddam am I hard now.

the end kind of sucks, but up until then, it's the best.
