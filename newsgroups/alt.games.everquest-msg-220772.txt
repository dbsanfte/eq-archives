	I never see them these days.  I dropped out of the game for about two
months due to RL stuff, and when I got back the crowd I hung with had
progressed too far up the PoP ladder for me to catch up.  Doubly true when the
raid leader raised the level caps so I couldn't even go on back flagging

done that once) or to PL a friend.
