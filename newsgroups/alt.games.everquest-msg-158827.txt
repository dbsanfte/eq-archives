We do as follows

Ubah Spell X drops of Boss_mob04

Its an enchanter spell

3 Enchanters are on the raid and all require the spell

The spell goes to the Enchanter who is most active i.e. has done the most
raids.

For boss dropped loot we use an ELP system (Event Lotto Points).

Eg. Raid to boss mob IV. Successful raid earns each member of the raid 2
points which is added to their total.

Item drops. You bid your lotto points. Those that raid more are equipped
faster as they have earned more points. These ensures those that support the
guild most are better equipped than Joe who raids once a month rather than 7
times a week. Better that Ubah BP-001 goes to MA who is MA on 99% raids than
Joe who is MA every now and then.
