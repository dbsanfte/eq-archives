I said the same thing, more or less, several months ago.

BUT, I've got two level 65 characters, and several more in their 50s 
that I stalled out on for one reason or another.

I hit 65 on those characters well before they released the 66-70 
expansion, and got them to a point where I'd have to change my play 
style drastically to move any further into content with them; I don't 
-want- to play the high end raiding game, so I wasn't interested in 
going any further with them.

I've tried just about every class I'm interested in.

I've been to most of the zones in the game that work for someone who 
isn't a hard core raider... well thats not really true, there are 
several I haven't been to that would work well in a group, IF you could 
find a group interested in going to them.  But they are generally 
considered out of the way and low on reward for the trouble, so its hard 
to find people who -will- go to them.

Without some radical changes, about 50% of the zones in the game aren't 
really something you can explore well while they are still challenging; 
its sad, but they are just outdated.

I was re-energized with the release of a new class with the GOD 
expansion, but it topped out early; something I feared would happen, but 
hoped that by the time I got up that high they'd have fixed the glaring 
problems at the high end of the game for it... sadly, they instead added 
5 -more- levels where the class is useless and in fact progressively 
-more- useless than it was before!

Also, many of my friends moved on, to COH or EQ2 beta, or just quit 
entirely; if a bunch of buddies got together with some sort of fun new 
play idea I'd probably jump back in, there -are- things I haven't done 
yet... but most of those things are the things I was never all that 
interested in doing in the first place.

This isn't to say I'm jumping on the EQ2 bandwagon, or on WOW for that 
matter.  I'm more interested in them than I was, but thats not saying 
much.  At the moment, oddly, I'm more interested in a much older game, 
one that was released back around the same time as EQ I think; NWN. 
Since the content for it is player created, in a way there's much more 
life in it than in any MMOG, where the only thing the players do is 
fight monsters that regenerate, and the only growth comes in the form of 
occaisional free releases adding or modifying zones, or expansions.

Plus, NWN doesn't require paying a monthly fee...in many cases, you get 
what you pay for... but its sort of like the Fanzine market for SF 
fan's; there's a lot of free SF out there, much of it dross but you just 
throw out what you don't like, since its all free anyway.
