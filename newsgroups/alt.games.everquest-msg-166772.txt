ah yes, the hp lag... i was main healer once on my shaman and lost our 
puller. He was far away (does distance make a differnace in how often 
bars are updated? like i run and my spirit wolf takes on what ever i was 
fighting i see it go from full health to no pet and no where in between) 
and i lagged, he went from 90 to 3% hp and before i could get off my 
healing spell to try to save him it was too late....
