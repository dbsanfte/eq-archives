Sorry, but there was too much so I just snipped most of it.

Now you've really caught my attention, James. And as such, I have to ask
you the following:

What exactly did those guilds do that you see as being "wrong". I mean,
specifically. They banded together and beat a very tough mob and got
themselves flagged for higher level content. What they do with their
time in that higher level content is 100% up to them so long as they are
not directly griefing anyone else. (And "directly" is the most important
part of that sentence, so read it carefully. "Directly griefing" would
not include getting rare expensive drops that you want by virtue of
being there first, or taking mobs you want to kill for the same reason.
It would include serious cockblocking, training, blowing times spawns to
prevent you from getting a mob they couldn't get, etc.)

They killed the mob and got flagged. So good for them. Now they get to
see more content. You stated yourself that some of them were killing
boss mobs in Plane of Water. Others were "farming", so they must at
least be able to hunt and kill *something* there, and likely getting xp
and good drops to boot. Sounds like they have as much right to be there
as you, in my opinion.


I ask because what it really sounds like to me is that you're pissed
that the elemental planes aren't reserved exclusively for guilds "of
your level" and that these peasants may be showing up there with their
smelly lowbrow ways.
