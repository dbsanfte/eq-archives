The coffin you will need is the 1Plat one sold in Neriak.  Find a Necro or
Shadowknight to summon you r corpse, and If you are woried about the los of
XP, which if you drowned there isn't any, then get a rez.

: If you post your server, there may be someone on the group who can help.
:
: SFG should count as a newbie zone, and maps should be available in it
: whether you have Legacy of Ykesha or not - hit backspace and see if a
: map of the zone comes up - that will help you get back out.
:
: If everything else fails find a helpful necro and have him summon your
: corpse out.  You'll need to pay for the reagent (a coffin, which one
: depends on which summon corpse spell the necro has to use).
