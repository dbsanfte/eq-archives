I had a similar problem about 6 months ago.
Turns out I had a virus that was trying to attach itself
to every dll and exe on my hardrive. Of course EQ would
detect a different file and re-download it again, then the virus
would infect it again, ending up in an endless loop of updating.
Try scanning and updating your system for Virii.
