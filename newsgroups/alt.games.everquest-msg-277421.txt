I like the responses you get, "Please consult with your fellow players" and 
other useful responses when the issue is an NPC that's been removed from a 
zone.  All I was asking for was a simple yes/no whether it would be replaced 
or if I should just delete the quest.

My "fellow players" didn't seem to have an answer...  the concensus finally 
was to just delete the quest as it hadn't been addressed since it occurred 
before the BC release.
