You need to call. Your letter won't be forwarded, and you will not get any
satisfactory response via email. Your only option is to call, if you feel
strongly about it, and try to get a supervisor. It's crucial that you stay
calm, though. If you are emotional, you lose. Also, your focus should not
be the reactivation of the account (this makes you look like a hopeless
addict in their eyes, and the person you will speak to won't be able to
relate), but getting credit for the three days of paid-for but lost
service.
