Sheesh, I`ve seen really strange names on different servers :

- Checker Cab (druid, lol),
- 'Bwahahahahahaha' as a surname,
- D'Sade (as in Marquis de Sade...) as the surname of  at least 3
characters - don`t know if they`re related,
- 'Afk' as a surname,
- a French character whose name translated to something like 'Bigomo
Hoosuxdix',
- and a Japanese name who was pure, unadulterated filth...

To me, Coeurd'Aigle is as tame as they get compared to how some other
non-anglophone players' names translate.  Furthermore, it`s 'in character'
or at least in the spirit of the game, isn't it?
