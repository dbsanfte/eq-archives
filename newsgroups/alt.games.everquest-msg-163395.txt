My personal addition to the worst list: Unnecessarily pretty new
graphics. I can't move in Luclin town areas, can barely function with
minimum clip in Luclin zones but as a result can't see 5 feet ahead of
me, can barely move from port book to port book in PoK but have to
stare at my feet to move at ALL in the buildings (an ogre had to lead
me like a blind to the druid spell vendor, and I couldn't find my way
out of that building on my own!), and haven't dared try to go to any
of the other planes to /lfg for worry the frame rate will be that bad.
No 61 or trials or PoP tradeskills/quests till I get a new computer,
thank you.
