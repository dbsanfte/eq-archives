Anyone know of any sites detailing Fear Plane, breakin, protocol, etc?
We'll be attempting this soon and, while big on enthusiasm, I think we
are lacking much in experience regarding Fear.  We're looking at 2
groups in the 50's with a few 60+ thrown in.  Most of all, we don't
want to get caught in a position where corpse retrieval is impossible.
 We know death will come to some or all.
