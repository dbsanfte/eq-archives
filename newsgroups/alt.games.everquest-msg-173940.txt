the landscapes look awsome, waves in the water, snow on the mountains when
it snows and such.  But the characters all look similar, and stiff, and the
interface looks kinda lame.  another thing that kinda bugs me about it is
that they use a pentagram for the magic spells.  i know its probally just
my, but i dont like it, thats why i never like diablo, something about
staring at a pentagram, heh.
