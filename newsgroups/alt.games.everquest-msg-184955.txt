Well, I have to disagree on the Enchanter/Neromancer pair.  I have a lvl 50
Enchanter and boyfriend has a 46 Necro.  We do very well togeter.  The trick
is learning how to get the chanter pet busy...that is easy..I pull with Tash
and take a hit..pet takes over..gets aggro and necro sends his pet in.  Any
damage done to the chanter can be healed with a necro heal.  This has work
for us on numerous occassions.
