Well, not really that much, but I still believe in the good in the brains in
some
person at Verants staff so that one day they maybe start making quest npc's
for those events that have NO invulnerable flag but just can't get hit
when you are above a certain level, so that a bunch of lower chars
gang gang up on them and beat the crap out of em, even if it takes ages.
But PLEASE without cheating :(
Where is the fun when GM attacks me, almost gets killed by my pet in melee
(pet down to maybe 20 healt) I have Dark Pact (350something reverse lifetap)
running on my pet and suddenly the near dead GM-controlled
char kills my pet in one blow???

Ah well - what do I complain to you - it's not like we had a different
opinion
on them GMs there :)

> On the lighter side, you don't take a loss from GM induced deaths, but

Well - I did lose xp sure enough, as stated in my other post...

 Ah well... Am really curious wether this AB server down
  with me in the midst of Crystal Caverns killed me some minutes ago.
   Another reason to petition... Haven't done so for a while.
