My truly first character was a human warrior starting in Qeynos because the
last game I played, starting a warrior was the easiest thing to learn a game
using.  But Qeynos sucks.

I started on 3/23/99 and my oldest surviving char is a 24 dwf cle created on
4/1/99.  So I guess it's not my first character, and NO WAY is it exclusive
(I have a 52 enc, 50 dru, 34 wiz and 2 or 3 others higher than level 24) but
when I tried to delete him a few months ago I just couldn't. :)
