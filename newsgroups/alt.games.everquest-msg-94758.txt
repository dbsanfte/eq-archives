Hate to say this, but if you 'knew what KSing was'...  You wouldn't be
asking if your group KSed.

What you believe was KSing was someone taking a mob you were camping.  That
is not KSing and if you petitioned a guide like that, they will quote you
what KSing is.

A camped area is an area to designate a group is there, and in some cases,
tell other people who are interested in said area that they might want to
look for another area to go to.  Such as Lower Guk...  People call camps
there a lot of time, and when people don't answer out, groups will make
their way there.  Often times, campers don't call out because they are busy
and don't see the camp call, and it pisses off the people who make their
way to said camp.

Camping is just a player ettiquette thing.  And if someone violates player
ettiquette, it just generates a bad rep which will probably hinder a player
later.  Don't assume that camp means hands off, it means, please respect
our space.  How you deal with camp jumpers is something you deal with
yourself and negotiate.
