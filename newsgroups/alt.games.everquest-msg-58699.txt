Misleading.  DAoC is a PvE game _until_ you fight against another realm. 
There is no PK within a single realm.  That guy at the shop next to you
isn't going to kill you the moment you leave town.  When you do fight
against another realm, it's very like fighting mobs with very good AI.  DAoC
really did a pretty good job on the PvP aspects of the game.

One downside, the wars between the realms are _the_ "endgame" fights.  I
think they will change this eventually as they realize that sometimes people
want to go fight a dragon or some hermit wizard of awe inspiring power
rather than just fighting an army quite similar to the one they belong to.

Or perhaps not.  Maybe that's my EQ-bias showing through.
