Ahem.
The OP asked a series of four SK questions. I posted an answer about
section one (taunt) stating that I knew nothing about SK's and couldn't
answer the other three parts. Only about taunt, which higher level
warriors know a thing or two about. You jumped in with:

> Lol thats complete crap.

Then went into a diatribe about how godalmight SK's were as tanks, etc.
and followed it up with incorrect information about taunt and SK's use
of it, etc. which you were called on later. You want to come out
throwing shit, be ready to get dirty. Your words, not mine. Deal.
