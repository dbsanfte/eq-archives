Is Grolj your usual dark elf guy?  Could be he was just trained there.  If
I'm KOS, I always invis up going to the OT these days because I've seen
people train half the dragoons and a golem over there.

Some red-to-me human agro'd me a while back, though, and he was nestled
against the wall between the entrances.  Didn't con agro to me, but agro'd
anyway.  I'm pretty sure I was on as a DE at the time.
