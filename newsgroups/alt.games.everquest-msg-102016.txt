Bad ananlogy.  True: druids & bus drivers only go to set locations.
If the bus doesn't go to the location, shouldn't the bus driver say
"Wait for the next bus or will stop Z be OK?"  He wasn't asking for a
port to Kelethin Bank; he wanted a normal stop for a wizard port.  He
offered to pay and should have gotten what he paid for, not something
close without discussion.  How'd you like a Flowing Black Silk Sash
for the going price?  By the way this one is red, but it's close
right?
