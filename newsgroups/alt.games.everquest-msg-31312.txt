Lance,
    Heh well AS a mage, I openly say to every cleric I'm with, "Your mana is
more important than mine."........then, of course I try to kill him/her.
Heh heh.  No, seriously, you mages, take a little advice from one who has
killed 4 and counting: YOU watch their life.  The good clerics are always
busy.  Their own life meter is sometimes ignored (and sometimes they're
trying to run the mana-transfer/correct-heal numbers in their head and just
forget).  You're pet's already engaged (right?!) so just play cleric and
watch a life meter for a little while.

Also, a question for you clerics (again, as a mage): A real good friend
(REAL good cleric) of mine said that the best thing to do for this
mage/cleric trick is to modrod all the way down to as little of life as is
possible then CH.  He said that the mana/life numbers worked out better that
way.  Other clerics I've helped since have all said no.  This is, of course,
considering the level of danger, but lemme know  your thoughts, please:

-Grim
P.S. > Mages Mod Rod
            This is mana generation for OTHER
    classes only.  The rods have some neat
    ideas for _stored_ mana, but they don't
    really help mages like the others listed...
