You do not know how long I have been a reader of this NG and you have no
idea what posts of yours I have or have not read.

I do not believe that I read your child porn post or your racism post.
Therefore, excluding this post to the father, still have NEVER agreed with
you. ;-)

One should try to be nice instead of being a grump so then so may people
wont flame him/her.
