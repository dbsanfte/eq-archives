Ah, one of my all time favorite dungeons. I haven't played a mage yet,
but I can tell you that in the high forties, while killing "between
spawn" time hunting elementals for smithing components, I solo'd most of
the rooms there with my warrior. Never actually broke and solo'd
Najena's room, but I can't picture it being too hard. Two of us wiped it
out and held it to get something for a lower level guildie and it was a
non-issue. The focus items I saw drop all fell down near the guard
captain's area, which you should be able to solo with no problems. Your
pet can likely take out that area while you get a sandwich.
