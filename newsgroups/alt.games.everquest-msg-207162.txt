Correct.  They've got at least one person who played EQ to the endgame in
the Velious era working for them on WoW: Tigole from Legacy of Steel.  I
think they have several LoS people from that era.

Indeed.  Heck...look how horrible Luclin was at the start, and Sony had EQ,
Kunark, and Velious under their belts already.  And look how smooth a time
Mythic had with DAoC, with no MMORPG experience.  It's pretty clear that
previous MMORPG experience doesn't mean you'll get it right every time, and
lack of experience doesn't mean you'll blow it.
