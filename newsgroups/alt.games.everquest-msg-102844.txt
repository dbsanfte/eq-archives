Verant has already stated that they consider Defensive overpowered, and had
they not already designed the high end encounters to take into account people
using it (to the point they would be nearly impossible without it) they would
have changed it.

At least 10 on E'ci, and growing all the time.

As for the recharge, lets compare... it takes VS 72 hours to respawn.   It
takes Gorenaire a week.  Same with Sev.   You don't think the same 4 wizards
could do all of them within a week, since they have to wait 2 and a half hours
between kills?   Also, pop times are random now, not server up.   The same 4
wizards will likely be able to do two on patch day alone.

Also, consider what it means to mid high level guilds, who don't have 4
manaburning wizards at thier command.    If Gorenaire pops, you have to get a
30 person raid into position, buffed and ready to go before 4 wizards port in
and press a button.    You don't see that as a bit of an advantage?    Hell,
worst case scenario, four assholes could farm her and ransom off the books and
scales for obscene amounts to people who want to actually have a chance of
completing thier epic.
