I need to know... well, everything!  Not counting the 36 Shaman in our 
group, everyone is now 41+, so it's time to move on...

I've read the stats on just about all the Mobs there and a lot of the 
related posts on Allakhazam.  EQAtlas doesn't have a map, so I DLd one from 
EQMaps, but it doesn't show spawn points or anything.  I did read that the 
pathing was horrible.

Where in CoM should our party fight: 41 WAR, 41 ( 1 blue to 42 ) WAR, 42 
CLC, 42 BRD, 41 MNK, 36 SHM?  I'm sure we will start at the zoneline and 
test the waters, but is there a good spot somewhere that we should pull to 
and camp after we get the gist of the place?

Any info on CoM is appreciated.  I have a Viik's, but the other WAR in our 
group wouldn't mind one, so if you can relay to me where the Shadows and 
Phantoms spawn, that would be great.
