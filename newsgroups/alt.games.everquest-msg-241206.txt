Just for a little validation... ya some peeps need to turn off the
jets and let them cool befor they post. 

now a question for ya...  why the hell do you keep replacing letters
with various characters...   sexual?  racial? asshatted?

its sorta like saying Gosh Darn it, when your really thinking God Damn
it...  do you really think the word sexual is offensive? or even
racial?   you still said them... you still ment them..   

I just dont get it...  I am curious, because you seem rather
consistant with this, and to me it seem odd. (thats not to say your
wrong or a fool, but just odd  8p   )

good luck with ya posting
