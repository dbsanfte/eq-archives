    Actually, I think he meant IBM.  But like I said, it was before 5:30 in the
morning.  He's often not very coherent in the middle of the afternoon!

   He's still talking about the thing, btw.  "It's the size of a tv!  It does 2
TRILLION computations!  2 TRILLION!" and so on.  We might have to wait for the
prices to come down a bit, but I know we'll have a couple of these babies.  I
wonder if it means we'll zone in less than a second.  No lag in the bazaar! 
Running all three accounts on one box!

   I want this thing too.
