Several problems with this...

Firstly, as you point out, it's an exploit and could lead to "sanctions" on
your account.

If the AE is a Fear type... your shield goes walkies, but keeps you on their
hate list... later on, after the fear wears off they'll come back after you
in ones and twos to prevent you resting/medding without
zoning/FDing/Succour'ing to clear the list after you've fought the AE
caster.

If the greenies are KoS to other Mobs, but you're not... then you might draw
agro from Mobs you're not trying for.

PB AE damage is not limited by number of targets... and if the radius of
effect is greater then 'melee range', you're still getting smacked by a
caster who is 'as close as he can get'... after all, they ARE casters, and
are arguably MORE dangerous beyond melee range where you're not close enough
to bash/kick/slash to interrupt them.

Even greenies can interrupt your own casting
