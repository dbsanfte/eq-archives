I agree with both of those criticisms. EQ2 has enough positives to 
have kept me as a regular player but I've been wavering recently 
for just those reasons.

Now it appears that EQ2 is getting something close to a complete 
overhaul. I've just read a whole bunch of official posts about it 
in the SOE forums, it's a dizzying list of changes. Literally 
every class's spells/abilities list is being redone from top to 
bottom, and a variety of game-wide changes are being made even 
before factoring in the upcoming major expansion. The key overall 
objectives seem to be:

-- undo EQ2's "locked" combat system, but without opening the door 
completely for kill-stealing;
-- make the difference in difficulty between normal mobs and 
"epics" more stark so that the latter are really truly difficult 
for a single group to take down and really require 2 or 3 groups, 
but without requiring EQ1-scale raiding to achieve top-end content;
-- sharply increase the functional diffrentiation between sub-classes.

There are also a variety of lesser adjustments, and the expansion 
has some interesting-looking stuff too, but those are the critical 
points. I dunno if they can pull all that off in one fell swoop 
without a whole bunch of gamebalance chaos, but they are running a 
full beta of the changes plus the expansion and are doing a good 
job of communicating about the changes as they work on them. So 
I'm cautiously optimistic.
