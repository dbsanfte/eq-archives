Long story.
I've been killing Tovax and his pet on an off for over 2 years now. The pet
started dropping that 240 silver<every time in 4-5 kills last month> and no
longer drops 240 silver.

I think you are giving more significance to the fact VI planned on HQ Lion
Skins dropping only from Highland Lions then I am.

I just tried killing Tovax again today when I saw him wandering around at 8
am game time. Bing! At 9 AM exactly game time Tovax disappears and a
skeleton seemed to take his place, joining his pet beating on the back of my
head.

Neither the skeleton that replaced Tovax or Tovax's Pet dropped a HQLS, but
if they had I wouldn't have been surprised.
