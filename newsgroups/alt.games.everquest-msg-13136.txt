I think it's a matter of courtesy. IMHO 'plz' and 'thx' just don't look very
polite.

<shrug>

When someone does me a favor, I want them to know I appreciate their
kindness. In your Cleric example I would say ' Thank you so much for your
kindness, may Tunare grant you strength and fortune in your travels'. Who
knows? Maybe a few responses like that would improve their vocabulary!

Honestly it's all subjective.

As far as stereotyping, yes it is (although I prefer the term
generalization). In my experience (again subjective) the vast majority of
players who talk in d00dspeek exhibit other characteristics I consider
immature. I won't go into specifics, but the thread about rudeness during
special events comes to mind.

It's not the fault of the d00dspeeker. It's mine. I'm an older player who
has developed an EQ personality that allows for some abbreviations and not
others. No real rhyme or reason for it, it's just me being a crotchety 37
year old.

I have never refused to SoW someone who said 'plz', but in general if
someone says ' May I be blessed with a Spirit of the Wolf' (which can be a
social hotkey BTW), they'll usually end up with a SLN or Chloro as a kicker
: ^ ).
