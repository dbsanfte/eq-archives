The way it works:  your four weapon slots (primary, seconday, range
and ammo) can't be looted.  Bags (containers of any sort) and anything
in them can't be looted.  NO DROP stuff can't be looted.  Everything
else is fair game.  So you have to be able to bag all droppable gear
in your armor slots and main inventory before dying.  There are no
shortcuts--you have to open the bags and put items in one by one.

BTW, this only applies to Rallos--Tallon & Vallon don't have item loot
anymore, and I don't think Sullon does either.  On those servers all
anyone can loot is coin.
