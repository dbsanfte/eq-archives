I don't play a bard, deleted one at level 10 because I feared for the health
of my wrists, so was basing miniscule upon the descriptions found on various
sites.  Ervaj is described as 5% to 15%.  The Luclin ones I haven't the
slightest clue about, perhaps they are much better.

Regardless, taking what you say at face, 25% as the maximum is surely
"miniscule" when compared to the haste of shissar or comparable.  They
aren't meant to be "haste" but rather "more haste".  I'm not saying they
aren't useful, just a miniscule addition when discussing the stacking
aspects.  :)
