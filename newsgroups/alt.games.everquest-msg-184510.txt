Everquest Linked to Child's Death 

 A father pleads guilty to the manslaughter of his son. Also, the
father liked to play Everquest. 

The St. Petersburg Times is reporting that a Hillsborough, Fl man has
pled guilty to aggravated manslaughter and will spend 15 years in
prison and five years on probation for the death of his nine month old
son. 

Tony Lamont Bragg Sr. apparently crushed his son in the doorway after
the father became annoyed at the child's crying. Bragg then left his
son in a playpen enclosed in a closet. The child died of a punctured
heart, and his ribs and left collarbone were fractured. 

The mainstream media made it clear that Bragg Sr. was heavily into
Everquest, and correlated the affinity with Everquest to the act of
child neglect.
