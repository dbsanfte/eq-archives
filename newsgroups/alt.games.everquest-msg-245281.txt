Precisely. And a very valid point.

In the case above if the warrior bids 6dkp on he's not being an asshat 
depriving the rangers of their uber-bow. If the rangers continue bidding 
into the dozens or hundreds and the warrior isn't letting up... then 
he's being a ass. But 6 dkp for a few hps upgrade... nothing lame about 
that. If the rangers don't want to bid more than 5 for the uber-bow ... 
their loss.

Now... your comments in general however, are still a very valid flaw in 
most dkp systems. Particularly with items that are 1 or 2 classes and no 
drop. There is little reason for two rangers to bid against each 
other... and far more sensible for them to simply agree to a loot 
order... and when the first ranger bids '1'. The other rangers all wink 
and say... 'pass', collectively saving a few hundred dkp between them.

Now on its own... this is fine... but of course, as you observed an 
imbalance occurs when all/all type items drop, and the ranger 'cartel' 
now has considerably more dkp at their disposal than they would have if 
they hadn't come to an agreement. This of course is going to rub anyone 
who isn't in a similiar cartel the wrong way.

What is the solution? Davian? How would the E'Ci dkp system deal with 
this. (I realize its a 'public system' so cartels are less likely... but 
supposing that it was a guild system... or that there are few enough 
zerkers or something that it becomes possible.)

Some guilds ignore it... and of course that leaves a pile of people unhappy.

The usual route taken is to put minimum values on items so that cartels 
are less effective at conserving dkp. The result of this is multiple:

1) items will rot because it will occur that nobody has the dkp to buy 
them. (e.g. after all the rangers have uber-bow... the warrior is not 
going to blow 100 dkp for the applicable 10hp upgrade...). This is stupid.

2) your back to an 'LC-group' setting the values for the items. All 
kinds of room for favourtism and bias in item pricing to take effect.

3) The new system doesn't completely resolve the problem. Guild 
composition and even raid composition *on individual raids* is still 
reasonably dynamic, and item class restrictions will still result in 
imbalances... if your raids are typically beastlord heavy but enchanter 
light the enchanters are still going to have less competition for 
'class' items when they drop, and cartels can still form around the 
minimum price and avoid any over-bidding... so they'll still have more 
dkp to bid on all/all items.

Worse cartels are inevitable... they're reason d'etre is not explicity 
designed to 'screw' others ... their motivation is usually design is a 
friendly gentlemans agreement not to compete over a drop, to benefit 
all. That another class is getting shafted on all/all drops isn't really 
part of the plan.

The only proposed solution I've ever seen that addreses cartels 
effectively without degrading into overwrought dkp systems dripping with 
loot councils... are queue systems. Unfortunately, I can't point to any 
guilds that are using one.

Queue systems in a nutshell award a queue-slot after a certain number of 
raids have been attended. Loot is awarded from the top of the queue 
down. So an item drops, and the loot goes to the top-most person in the 
queue who wants it, thereby removing themselves from the queue.

In most versions a person may have multiple queuslots in the queue 
working their way up. Some require him to use his topmost queue slot... 
others let him use any queue-slot.

If an item passes through the queue with no takers it can either be 
randomed to people who are not in the queue at all (and it will burn the 
winners next queue slot when he earns one -- a key to preventing 
cartels) or I suppose it could be left to rot.. but I really hate to see 
that happen.

The main theoretical problem with this system is maintaining a 
reasonable and stable queue length, so that it grows at the same rate as 
slots are removes...

At this point we're way out of the nutshell so I'll drop it... but its 
still a system I'd really like to see fleshed out and played with. I 
think it has a lot of potential.

The main advantage over dkp is that it dodges the imbalances inherent in 
  'loot pricing' shemes like dkp without losing its impartiality (ie its 
not a Loot Council)
