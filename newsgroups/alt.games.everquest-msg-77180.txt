Also the player crafted Compound Shadewood flavors of bow are range 200.
The max range I have seen reference to is 200 whether dropped, or player
made.  As for arrows, in addition to the Gloomwater arrows, the player made
arrows with parabolic fletching and small nocks are also 150 range.  This
does not change what you stated as the maximum range, just thought I'd
mention that the maximum range is achievable using player made bows and
arrows as well as dropped ones.
