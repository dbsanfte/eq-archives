SOE has always maintained the rather dubious party line that if you
think it's against the spirit of their rules, then you should expect
to be whacked for abuse.

What really bothers me about this case is that I couldn't tell I was
running afoul of their nerf-bat (which BTW they promised they were
done with in the dev chat).

In this case, I was researching what bought and sold best and found
several items that were selling low in the bazaar but had high value
to tribute merchants.

"Why would they do that," thinks I... well, it seems obvious enough
that they want these items to be rarer and more valued. Certainly
that's accomplished by making them valuable to tribute masters and
then letting folks like me scoop them out of the bazaar. This sounds
like a win/win to me and I thanked them via feedback for a wonderful
compromise solution to the problem of bazaar flooding.

But no. In the end, I will end up getting screwed out of tons of
points because those items (e.g. Weighty Polearm) have had their point
value slashed, and I've already spent large amounts of the points. So
sometime next week my point total will go negative, and I'll probably
just give up. Why play a game where the rules will get changed
retro-actively :-(
