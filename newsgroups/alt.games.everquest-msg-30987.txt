Sorry I insulted some people in my previous topic.

The initial writing of the topic came out not as I wanted it to, now that i
read it again.

Yes, EQ was initially designed as a PvE game, and I'm glad that it now
caters to a few different tastes.

All I'm saying is, if you have never tried any of the PvP servers, please
do.  There are loads of exciting activities that go on.
For example:

(1) Sebilis was once a lightie controlled zone.  One night, the darkie
guilds (such as Xanit K'Ven), and xteaming guilds (Prophets) decided to take
it over.  There was a massive war, and in the end, the darkies control the
zone.
On what non pvp server can you have wars over a zone?  i think that is the
greatest part of PvP servers:  zone control, item control, and the will of
players to wage war and sacrifice themselves for their guilds.

On a non pvp server, when someone is KSing your group for example, what do
you do to them?  /rude?  On a pvp server, you have the option of hunting
them down and making sure they never wanna bothor you again!

(2) About a month ago, in LOIO, i was on my warrior, exping a little in the
sarnak fort.  Shouts ran accross the zone of a war on the iksar city.  I
made haste to where the lighties were organizing.  I joined them, and we
made a rush on the lizard man city.  We waged war outside their city, i took
down a few iksars in the process, but their sheer numbers eventually
overwhelmed us.

I think the reason why a lot of people say PvP servers are full of griefers
is because they start a character on the server, and never pass lvl 10 with
the char.  Most griefers stay below lvl 10, and once you hit planar lvls,
the PvPing is much more organized and with cause.  For example: Prophets is
an uber x-teaming guild (lights and darks) and Xanit K'Ven is an uber darkie
only guild.  They were tormenting many high lvls until guilds like Defiant
were formed for the sole purpose of countering Prophets and Xanit K'ven.

This is not a topic to insult blue servers or the people who play on them.
I want people to post their most exciting PvP experiences here to show some
people that PvP servers are far from just being populated with griefers.
