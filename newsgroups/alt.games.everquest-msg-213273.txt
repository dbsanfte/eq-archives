This statement is very true.  Do you remember when airlines started
requiring that children above age 2 must have their own seat and
parents had to buy tickets for them?  It was after a crash where a
mother tried to hold onto her baby in her lap.  It turns out that
requiring children to have their own ticket lead to more children
deaths.  Many familes could not afford the additional tickets for the
children.  So many familes drove to their destination instead of flew.
 Driving is much more dangerous than flying which lead to more
children dying overall.  So although a child in an airplane might be
safer in a crash if he's in his own seat, the policy lead to more
overall deaths because of the highway travel.
