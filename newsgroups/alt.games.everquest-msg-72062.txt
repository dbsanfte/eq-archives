Actually, each character can see about 2/3 of the world--you forgot
that you can go to the enemy frontiers.

The non-frontier part of each realm is definitely way bigger than WK.
It's hard to compare because DAoC realms are generally less
rectangular than EQ zones, and zoning in EQ adds to travel time,
making the perception of the world seem larger.

I keep meaning to measure some of this stuff when bored, but haven't
been that bored yet. :-)  Maybe over the holidays...
