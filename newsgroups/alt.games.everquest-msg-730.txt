There's no reason to believe that they are going to this sort of
system.  They only said that "the experience will be split up
according to level".

But it is already IS being split up according to level (albeit with
the effect of exp penalties thrown in as well).  I suspect that rather
than totally revamp the "level split", they'll just remove the
exp penalty effect, and leave in the current "level split" calculations.

They could do this in the same way that they calculate death penalties
now (e.g. in relation to the exp that a human warrior of the same
level as your char).
