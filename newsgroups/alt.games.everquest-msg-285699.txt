Ain't THAT the truth  :)  I also still can't get over having my pal
and I killing puny bears for 45 minutes, simply to get bear meat for a
quest.  We only needed a couple of bits each for God's sake!  It takes
the fun right out of the game when you only have a couple of hours to
play, when you have to put up with crap like that.
