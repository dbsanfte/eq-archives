Unfortunately that is "customer service" as it works today. CSR's are
rewarded for closing the most cases in the least number of time NOT FOR
SOLVING PROBLEMS. It was a big shock to me when I started in the industry. I
suspect that the problem is that the people who control things insulate
themselves from the customer base so that they never hear from them. The
CSR's are a form of ablative shield.

Ultimately the only way the customer can make themselves heard is by
leaving, whereupon the PHB in charge shrugs his shoulders at the
impossibility of pleasing those idiots (didn't they get a prompt response?
look at these great statistics!) and he then moves on to his next high
paying job if the company folds.

I've seen this change occur in my lifetime, from the tech support attitude
(good fixers get rewarded) to the customer service position (do you want
fries with that?).
