  They said the game would be up at 11 am (my time).  It is now almost 6 pm
(my time) and I still cannot access the game.  Obviously they weren't
"telling the truth".  It might be a little harsh to say they're lying (which
is why I put that part of my message in quotes, if you noticed) but
regardless, they are not giving their customers remotely accurate
information.  I realize these are estimates, but in this case the estimate
is radically off.  In all my time playing I can only remember two Verant
patches that were on time, and one that was early.  Every other time they've
been late, usually by at least a half hour.  To be fair, I've only
experienced two patches since I started playing again, but so far they're 0
for 2 for being on time.  From where I'm sitting, they used to be habitully
late, and they still are.

  Liars or not, I consider Verant ETAs virtually worthless.  That was my
point, not to mudsling at Verant.
