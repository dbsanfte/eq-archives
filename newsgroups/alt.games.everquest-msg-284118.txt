Probably just different playing styles, I'm guessing. If you were fighting
mobs where you had to have the heals to stay alive, it's probably not fast
enough.  If you're fighting mobs you'd survive without heals, it's just
fine. We tend to play very conservative and undergeared.... if you were
fighting relatively tough mobs, that would probably explain it. For us,
Katta guards in our low 40s were a tame xp grind, Dranik's Scar at 46 was
a near wipe in under 10 seconds.
