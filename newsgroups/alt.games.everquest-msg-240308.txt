Was I looking for your affirmation sir? Do I really care if you
respect me as a player? Would you like to come over to my house and
fuck my sister? I ain't your friend partner, nor did I solicit your
respect. I stated an opinion on a USENET newsgroup, which most people
would point out isn't exactly a Think Tank inside the Beltway.

Second, did I say it was the only way to go? No, it was something you
read into it.

My point was, when you get away from balance in a group for purely
personal reasons it usually functions like a one-legged retarded boy
trying to swat flies with a rake. Can unbalanced groups work? Yeah,
I've been surprised at times, but that is extremely rare and usually
they don't.

>I think the problem in the scenario you mentioned lies with you, not them.

If I have 3 warriors in a group.. unless they're fricking elemental
equipped with lots of offensive AA and very good 2hs, you can't
miracle your ass up real DPS. You can't suddenly say some magic words
and blow mobs over. Likewise, if you're using a shaman for healing
you're going to constrict the pace of what you can do and how often
you can do it.

>That's just not the way it's meant to be, bud. /shrug

Shrug, if you want to get the world together and sing Hands Across
Norrath, that's fine. If I want a glorified chat room with lots of
drama i'll go load up IRC. I'm looking to play the GAME and do it at a
high level with people who know what the fuck they're doing. And the
easiest way to make that happen is generate balanced groups that
aren't built to fight against themselves.
