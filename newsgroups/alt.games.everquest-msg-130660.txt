I think I understand what he's trying to say.  Not all of the Isreali count
is civilian, which has been suggested.  IIRC, a few of the fatalities in the
bus bombing a few weeks ago were soldiers.  Of course, they aren't targeted
specifically as military targets either.  It would be like blowing up a
grocery store in Virginia Beach... sure, you're bound to take out some
squids, but that doesn't make it a military target.

I will state for the record, to remove it as a possible place to dodge.  Not
all the Isreali casualties were civilians, nor were _all_ the attacks
targeted against civilians.  That said, the majority were against civilian
targets.
