It's the HTML purist in me that's disgruntled. Some of the files were
300+ kb where 250+ kb was just coded blank space at the bottom of the
list... my machine gets sluggish after going through a lot of webpages
(stupid IE) and I was forced to trim those pages if I wanted to make
them useful as two or three of them would be enough to mess things up.

Well, there's so many new options for metal look now... 
You should check out
http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showMessage?topicID=3200.topic
- lots of very sweet metal look uber gear in that thread. (Especially
the last entry on the first page, with crystal chitin armor)
