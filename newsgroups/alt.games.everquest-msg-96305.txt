Hmmm...  Let's see... you are a 3rd Level Druid...  I currently have a 52nd
level Druid, a 18th level Cleric, a 13th level Enchanter, a 19th level
Ranger, an 11th level Beastlord and an 18th level Bard.  From my own
experience...  You DON'T have to push the meditate button as you enter the
spell book once you have meditate.

Clicking the 'meditate' button before you have the meditate skill does
nothing.  If it doesn't stay depressed, you aren't meditating.  Notice
also, your skill for meditate does not seem to be there as a Druid at 3rd
level when you check your skills.  When you go to the trainer, it will even
state, meditate 'Level 8', which means you can't learn that skill until you
are Level 8.
