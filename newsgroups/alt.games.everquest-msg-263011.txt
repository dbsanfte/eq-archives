On the first mob that turns up, the warrior has to survive the first few
rounds unslowed.  The warrior has a finite amount of hitpoints, a set
amount of AC, and a number of AA which assist in that.

If the warrior can't survive that initial onslaught, then there's no point
taking the warrior.

On the second mob that turns up, no matter how long after the first, one,
it's no different.  Every time a mob turns up, the warrior has to survive,
and no matter how long between mobs, it's no different.

Flowing thought, rate of dps from dps classes, mana regen, etc., etc in the
other classes can be managed by slowing the pull rate.  That's something
that can be controlled, if necessary, if it even matters.

But can you survive the first unslowed 1k quad is key to group survival.

Whether the question is right or wrong, and should or should not be asked
isn't something I'm answering, I'm just explaining why tanks get asked
about HP and AC.  The group wants to survive the first mob.

You can get to level 70 in BoT and LDoN, but it might take time.  You can
get to level 70 without any AA.  With new OoW title options you can no
longer tell how many AA people have necessarily from their title.  People
are cautious.
