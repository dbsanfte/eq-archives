I'd have to disagree with the idea that casters are untwinkable; to
effectively twink them, you simply have to turn them into mini tanks. My
necro had *no* downtime until she reached level 8; not once did she have
to sit and med or heal until then. After that, until level 20, her
downtime was minimal. She was twinked with *lots* of hp and mana items,
as well as relatively high ac armor. She was also given a high
damage/low delay weapon. It was actually quite effective IMO, although I
did have to spend some time later raising a couple of spell skills I
hadn't used much. OTOH, her melee skills/offense/defense are *extremely*
good for a caster. /grin 

As an avid twinker, I'm not too happy with the idea of level restricted
items myself. Personally, however much real newbies may resent or be
jealous of the fact that I have better gear, I've outgrown the thrill of
killing rats and bats in the newbie gardens and I don't really see any
good reason why I should do it. I've been playing this game for 2.5 yrs.
now and logged... Well, let's not discuss just how much of my life I've
wasted in Norrath, but, trust me, it's an embarrassing amount. It's a
game; it should be *fun*. Rats and bats are no longer entertaining for
me. /shrug
