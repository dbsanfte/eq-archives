Here's the thing; nobody is seriously arguing the merits of your method, 
rather, they are making fun of your attempt to promulgate your 
invention, real or not, on a usenet site dedicated to the game 
everquest.  In everquest, an item like a "non stick frying pan" is 
interesting only insomuch as it permits making of recipies such as the 
"patty melt" which can be used to increase skill in "baking".

If you had announced the discovery of the EQ item "heat retentive plate" 
it would be of interest here, and people would want the recipe for 
making it, and be looking for baking recipies which use the new item, if 
any.

However, you aren't discussing some item within the fantasy world of EQ, 
but rather one which (if it indeed exists) apparantly does within the 
"real world".

At a minimum, prefacing your thread with the letters OT to denote that 
you are off topic would be necessary to get any serious treatment.  More 
likely, even this wouldn't help, you just aren't dealing with "real 
world" people here.

You might try looking for alt.cooking or alt.physics or even 
alt.alien.science, where discussion of hypothetical real world items 
like your plates and mugs might be met with at least a modicum of 
postive consideration.
