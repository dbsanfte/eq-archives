I'm afraid to post to this or any other newsgroup, now, and I can point to
this post as the cause.  I am suing you for emotional distress.  Anyone else
that feels the same, should contact my lawyers (Hugh Dewey, Dubert Cheatham
& Lou Howe Better known as Hughie, Dewey, Louie or the Lawfirm of Dewey,
Cheatham and Howe), we could have a true class-action here.  I hope you are
very wealthy or better yet, you work for a huge corporation and were posting
from their computer, they didn't monitor your activity so they are
responsible for your heinous actions.  There's the deep pockets we could go
after.  I just await your confirmation that this is the case.
