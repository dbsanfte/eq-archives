A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the

Bad analogy. The point was that people wanted to play in a world with
horses and buggies in the beginning. Then airplanes were brought in.
More efficient? Yes. The world people wanted to begin with? Not
necessarily.

I'll put it a different way. Here is a story for you. Take Dark Age of
Camelot. People happily RvRing with their swords and spells out in the
frontier. Then Mythic in a fit of insanity takes a look at Planetside
and says, "Hey, they're having lots of fun there with tanks and
vehicles. Let's put those in DAoC!"

And so they do. And in the end, a big bunch of people are all happily
RvRing in their vehicles and tanks. But its not the same people who
were playing before. Those people didn't want vehicles and tanks. They
wanted swords and magic. The game itself is very different now than it
was before too, with almost a fps feel.

According to the beancounters who say the subscription rates are the
same as before, and the defenders of the vehicles and tanks, this was
a good change. Poll the playerbase and you get much the same story.
But was it really a good change, or was it such a baseline change that
those who would have said its a bad change are no longer even there?

EQ could have developed in many different ways when it was first
making its early expansions. One of these ways was to shovel more and
more content en masse. That is the option they chose, and from Luclin
on it *seemed* to bear fruit, though to those who were paying
attention dark clouds were building on the horizon in the form of
runaway mudflation and later unsolvable class balance issues. This
method, however, brought with it accompanying problems of
undercrowding and the job of balancing risk vs reward in the new zones
was beyond the Sony dev team's talents. In the end, they gave up on
any pretense of making a "roleplaying world" and settled for making a
"roleplaying game". One of the keystone differences? A "roleplaying
world" pays more attention to being a world and therefore limiting
instant travel in some way. A "roleplaying game" is only interested in
allowing players to grind as efficiently as possible, and those things
necessary to make a "world" are seen as obstacles, or in the
terminology of most powergamers... downtime.

However it didn't HAVE to be that way. Another way would have been to
enhance existing content through the use of scripting and quests (not
run and fetch baloney), like WoW is doing, while only modestly adding
new areas. We know Verant was capable of making scripts as early as
during the Kunark era, since the Splitpaw change and several of the
big GM events involved them. Did they find them too timeconsuming and
difficult? Or perhaps just adding zones and making the numbers on the
new gear bigger was just... easier?

It hardly matters now, since the choice was made and you can't go back
once there (and so I don't support the original suggestion in this
thread), at least not easily and not in the current EQ climate. But
don't for a second think that just because EQ went that way means
there wasn't support for the other. UO was more along the lines of the
alternate option, the "roleplaying world" option, and had it not had
unbelievable PvP problems and rampant cheats (plus being so outdated
graphically) it might well have stayed #1.

The audience is out there. The "new EQ" philosophy isn't as dominant
as some of you think. It just happens that no other game has even come
out with the alternate mindset, none worth playing at least.
