Hell yeah it is.  Granted, I'm not twinking my Druid, because I wanted that
character to be au natural.  My shammy and Bard, OTOH are lightly twinked...
only so much a perpetually 28 Paladin can twink ^_-

That's my problem with anti-twinking.  Those first few levels aren't exactly
fun.  If I don't have to go through them again, I won't, and I don't really
see what business it is of anyone's if I choose to zip through them.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
