    My rule of thumb is this: you want max. AC and max HPs, after that
resists, after that stats. When trading AC and HPs, giving up one AC should
get you 10 HPs or more back to do the trade. So, for example, my warrior
wears an SSB over the Crafted Helm because it gives up 1 AC, but has 35 more
HPs. If the two helms had the same AC/HPs on them, I'd have compared
resists, then (if those were the same) I'd compare other stats. IIRC Ry'Gorr
Gloves are better than Crafted Gloves, but most of the other pieces of
Ry'Gorr are inferior to Crafted.
