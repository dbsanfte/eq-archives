I've noticed a huge rise in the percentage of enchanters that suck, 
lately.  Many of them don't seem to know the differences between their 
various mezzes.  I went on a hedge run in PoN a while back with a 63 enc 
who had never heard of 'Apathy' or 'Sleep'... Sigh.  Worse, he didn't 
understand how boggle was different from mem blur, and couldn't figure 
out how to stop Thelin from beating up the bard.  Lucy is your friend!

It's probably because it's too dang easy to level now.  I've noticed 
similar stuff going on in other classes (like say, the aforementioned 
bard not knowing how his aoe dots were drawing Thelin's aggro in the 
first place...), but I don't know those classes as well so I'm less likely 
to spot it.

Personally, I always try to be as polite as possible in such 
circumstances.  What you say there isn't bad, probably reasonably 
acceptable.  But I would put it to the group more like, "Well, this really 
doesn't look like it's going to work.  Do you guys think we should can it?"

Odds are, the ones who aren't AFK will say 'yeah, definitely'.  And then 
it's a group decision, and you're sure nobody's going to resent you for 
it.  Except possibly Mr. AFK.  But AFK people don't get to vote. :)

I also tend to be the hard-headed one who wants to try and stick it out 
even if I have to solo it though.  It just takes way too long to get 
the damn things together in the first place... I'd rather kill the few 
mobs I can and at least get some exp. :)  But if everyone else wants to 
leave, I'll go along.  Still, some of my favorite LDoNs have been ones 
where we had horrible obstacles and kept trying, even though we 
eventually failed.  Like the one where the only healer went LD right after 
zonein, and one rogue was LD 60% of the time, and we wiped horribly on the 
first pull and had no rezzer...  But with Uproar we got almost half done 
before we decided to give up. :)
