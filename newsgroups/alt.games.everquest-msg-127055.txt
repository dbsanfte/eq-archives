Last night in Crystal Caverns, I ran into another monk. We soloed side by 
side, cooperating on pairs, commiserating on the pain of being Slowed, and 
generally having a blast. At the end of it, he gives me two loots that 
dropped on his mobs, for no apparent reason. A Crystal Covered Shroud 
(which looks way pimp on my monkey) and a Cloak of the Ry'Gorr Oracles.

Then, after I banked my Spore Covered Tunic and the cloak, I run through a 
litter of some higher-levels orc corpses and loot them all(one man's 
trash...). What do I find, but a Foremans Skullcap.

Grand total on the three items is a little bit under a kpp. 

I guess I am just really excited to be at a level where I can actually make 
some coin. :)
