  I think the reason you'll find your characters are "broke" is indeed
their level and perhaps your lack of experience in EQ in general (no
offense).  If you know where to hunt, it's a lot easier to make money
at lower levels for any class.

  Before level 20, there aren't a lot of mobs that are really rich.
Some mobs drop good loot, but usually their good drops are
semi-rare... HQ bear skins, greater lightstones, ect.  The Warrens is
one of the few good pre-20 places for loot, I think.

  As you advance up and beyond level 20, you can start fighting a few
mobs that have a chance at dropping better loot.  Fine steel weapons,
nice gems, platinum coins, ect.  Around level 24, for example, you can
start fighting forest giants in Warsliks, who may drop nice weapons to
sell to vendors like legchoppers, grub diggers, tree flayers and
hammers of flattening.  You can also start participating in dungeon
raids around level 20 where loot that people will actually pay for
will start dropping.  There are also a few mobs you can "farm" at this
level for consistently good money, like bards who always drop
instruments worth over a platinum.

  And, of course, once you get up around level 37, you can fight hill
and sand giants which consistently drop fine steel weapons, other
little goodies, and coin drops that can be in excess of 40 platinum.

  Right now, you're highest level character is a druid, and level 18
is sort of a sore spot for druids.  Your nuke sucks, your heal sucks
and the fights don't usually last long enough for your DoTs to matter
and melee-wise you're getting to the point where there almost is no
point.  You don't have a pet, you don't have your teleports, ect.
About all you have of much worth is SoW, your damage shields, your
buffs and maybe Panic Animal against specific mobs.  However, at level
20, this all starts to change.  You get a powerful nuke and a powerful
heal and things generally just start to turn around.

  As others have noted, the poorest class are generally monks, since
they can't pick up very much without taking on an AC penalty.  On the
flipside, however, monks don't really need very much.  They can deal
out a pretty good amount of damage totally unarmed, they get an AC
bonus that helps them with lack of armor and they don't have to buy
any spells.

  There you are.
