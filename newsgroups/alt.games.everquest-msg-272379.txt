Oh, oh... check out this excellent and completely free Antivirus program 
I am using now. I recently got an infection myself and this software 
found and eradicated it with no harm done. It was some trojan with an 
Italian sounding name I forget now. Great stuff with frequent virus 
definition file updates and it is free to individual users. I think they 
make their money on corporate sales:

If you've still got it, this will kill it. Sorry he got you.
