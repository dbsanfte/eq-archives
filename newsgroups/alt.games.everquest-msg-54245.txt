No, AoW was "We Want It To Be A Challenge To Kill This"...but turned
out to be "We Tuned This Fucker To Be Impossible To Kill, Whoopsie!".

AoW needs just a slight tweak to be killable (they may have already
done this with the last set of patches).

Kerafyrm, is just not killable.
Quad 1950 + chain flurry and death touches along with regen so high
that continuous Cazic Touches by a GM for 10 minutes solid didn't put
a dent in his health.  No sorry, any Velious mob with a death touch is
generally considered "Not Killable".

This includes Jaled Dar's Shade.
