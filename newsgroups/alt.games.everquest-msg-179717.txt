I suppose that if suddenly all the people in France suddenly were to vanish,
then all the Hugenots in the world would likely start going there I would
assume. Well, I can tell you right now that in 7 years when everyone in that
area is either dead or raptured away the Hugenots will return to their
homeland.

Basically, I want one of two things to happen in France during this 3.5 year
period

1)To accept God and be saved and protected during that period
2)To reject God and be annihilated

Only one possible thing will occur in the second 3.5 year period

1)Total destruction of all people and most structures
