Isn't that the truth. There is only a handful of people I still chat with
that I have know for several years. It is rather funny looking at our chat
channel to see a dozen of us spread in levels/servers/guilds. Probably only
be in one spot at the same time when eq2 comes out.
Currently some folk are back looking at Daoc's expansion.

Developing relationships takes time and effort and I admit while in guild I
would not spend a ton of time when I saw a new recruit levelling like mad.
Inevitably the player was off to raiding guilds. For players doing pickup
groups anyway. Not much point in a guild really.
