/em sighs.  I promised myself I was going to stay out of this one....

According to the dictionary definition someone posted around here somewhere,
a phrase requires at least two words, each of which has meaning on its own.
Does a nauseatingly cute misspelling like "kat" count as a word?

I think you should be able to use phrases for names as long as they can fit
into a pseudo-medieval world.  "Kitty Kat" (or Quicksword, or Softstepper,
or Coppereyes, etc) would therefore be acceptable in my eyes, because I can
see how a character could acquire a nickname like that.  But how, in a game
without gunpowder, could anyone get a name, nick or otherwise, like Busta
Capp?  And as for Badazzz, oh please!  I think applicability should be the
criterion.
