I really like Erollisi Marr.

I met the best people, including Celaeno (who regularly posts on this NG)
and my current Guildmates.

Yes, we have our share of idiots, but they stay in LoIO from 20 to 60 so
they aren't too annoying.

My good experiences far outnumber my bad. Yesterday a player named Darkwen
sold me my Druid pet spell for 4500PP (much less than I've seen it go for
elsewhere), then swapped stories with me on how he used the spell when he
first got it.

A couple days ago a couple of  folks were camping the tower in OT. They let
my lvl 29 Iksar SK practice my 2HB skill on their mobs and when I camped and
switched to my main, they sent me a tell because Zorash had popped and
dropped the boots!

I never go anon and RARELY get beggars, even in newbie zones. Our GFay seems
calm compared to the stories I read about other servers regarding begging
and 'GFay-mart'.

Every single raid I've attended has been a pick-up raid, and they have all
been successful and enjoyable.

Just my 2cp

And no one on EMarr cares if you top-post.

Drywit, 55 Druid Erollisi Marr
