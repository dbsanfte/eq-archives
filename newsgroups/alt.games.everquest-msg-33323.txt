Hehe, the 4 hearts are not a problem to get, level 13-18 mobs, just take a
LONG time, think i got more frustrated on this one than i did on Gynok in
Befallen.
The DE heads for quest 2 is a no brainer, easy to do.

And generally people are friendly when you need the last items for quest 3.
Asked around in Sol A to get the powder, then started killing goblins near
the entrance, 15 min after someone had one for me near entrance.

The White Hellebore i got for buffing a group in Splitpaw.


The hard one was the Mistmoore drop, but was lucky enough to run into a
raid hosted by Reunited Clan (great guys), so joined their raid, and got 9
blue bubs of XP and my item in 3 hours.
