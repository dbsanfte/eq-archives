Logged on my shaman, memmed Frenzy, moved to Nexus where my boots will work.

Clicked Boots, got SoW
Cast Frenzy, all spell buttons greyed out
Clicked Boots, got SoW
All spell buttons still greyed out
Repeated boots 6 times
eventually spell buttons became available again as usual after casting frenzy

So no, unless there's some secret to this, an insta clicky doesn't seem to be a
remedy to the no cast phenomenum
