As the subject says, looking for recommendations on where to go for
further experience at level 31.

Looking for both groups (preferred) and solo (very weak tank)
suggestions.

Important point is that I have no expansion packs.

currently in Highpass, which is now maxing out on Goblins. Well, they
are not green yet, but exp comes glacially slow and I really can not
solo there.
