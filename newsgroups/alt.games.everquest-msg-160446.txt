Beware getting a port from a Wizard or a Druid to an expansion you do
not have; I was on my way to a raid when the druid in the party
decided to make an UNANNOUNCED stop in Velious, which I did not have
at the time. It of course crashed my EQ, and I was unable to log in or
get ahold of a GM for over a week. I ended up having the buy the
expansion just to get out, because even when friends logged in to get
my character out, it would crash them.

Bloody frustrating.
