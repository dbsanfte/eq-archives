My only comment:

I have a good psychiatrist that I can refer you to help deal with the anger,
as you are obvious full of it.

You are right about her starving for attention, as I am the only parent of 2
kids.  I would tell you the story, but it's obvious that you don't give a
shit about anything, well, except for expressing your anger.

Anyway, I will leave you kids alone to ramp about as I refuse to read
anymore of this hatemail.
