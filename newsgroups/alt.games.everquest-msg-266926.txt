    What exactly is this limit? What says a company can only expand content
so far?

    Even the basic roles of characters can change - and Sony has been in the
process of discussing such basic changes with its playerbase. Their lack of
progress has more to do with lack of resources than any limitation. We are
talking about software, not some steel-stamped product. The only barriers to
change are the customers' expectation, and we have a situation where many
customers expect change.

    Which is why Sony's worst mistake was failing to market the game to new
players.

    That is also the reason we have the culture of the dominant uber
player - there are too many of them and not enough noobs, meaning either
that old players take a huge long time to leave EQ (true) and/or that not
enough new ones are arriving.

    You look like a bloody idiot yanking on about a communist revolution
after someone mentions socialist democracy.

    And I'm not going to be drawn into a debate on the subject. Haven't been
that stupid in eight years.
