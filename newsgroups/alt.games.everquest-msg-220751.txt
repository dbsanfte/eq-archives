That's exactly the appeal of Star Trek... It shows progress not just of 
the hardware, but of the people as well. Obviously, the conflict 
necessary to make good drama out of is, by necessity, contrived, as a 
more advanced society as portrayed in ST would by definition be more 
adept at efficient conflict resolution.

What's arguably the best written Science Fiction universe out there, 
Iain M. Banks's "The Culture" suffers from the same problem... The 
godlike AIs that inhabit the Culture suffer conflicts that are obviously 
serving dramatic needs, rather than being appropriate to beings of their 
intelligence and power. It's a non-resolvable issue if you want to write 
a novel with a plot, instead of, say, a fantasy travelogue.

An extrapolation of what humanity may (with any luck) be like in the 
24th Century is what ST is about, not the 20th Century with lasers.

It could be argued that Star Trek is the anti-1984, anti-Lord of the 
Flies, anti-Animal Farm (although it certainly represents a Communist 
utopia), and anti-Brave New World. It is, primarily, an *optimist* 
vision of the future.

Huh? Subtlety and depth are the result of pitting grey against grey. If 
you pit Black against White, you get The Lord of the Rings, which is 
beautiful, but not exactly subtle.
