Now that we've wandered ENTIRELY not only off topic, but off newsgroup,
I'll bore you with an explanation. Upon my arrival there, I had been
going by the handle "Jazz". (Since that's what I use IRL). I found, much
to my dismay, that one of the long time regular posters there was (and
still is) using the hanle "Jaz". (Short for Jason, IIRC). Well,
obviously the potential for confusion between the two was simply too
great, and I was flamed mightily for the name I was using. Through a
series of conversations too rediculous to go into, I got a few tumblers
of Jack Daniels into me and suggested I alter the spelling significantly
enough that it would be fairly obvious to even the most drunken eye that
it was a different poster. That's how I arrived at "jaZZ".  Since any of
my real life friends that get to know me for more than five minutes seem
to morph that into "Jazzmanian Devil" for some reason, I modified it to
what you see today. There endeth the boring lesson for today in
meaningless Usenet history.

While I've been there to visit, I've never been an actual Brit, bloody
or otherwise.

Pfah. I've had worse.

Jazz
Drunk and "Merkin" regardless of what other crotch covering connotations
it may have. (oooooo, nice alliteration)
