My Monk carries Gems instead of currency with good cha you will lose about
10% on a transaction. the only thing is most players will not accept Gems as
payment so you have to run to a vendor to Sell the gems. If you are not in
good with that vendor and your cha is too low you can lose as much as 25-35%
selling the gem. I will carry looted gems with me to by supplies and some
high end gems to give for a res donations or something but as far as carry
large sums of plat in gems you will go broke very quickly.
