I did some poking around with my bard... and another solution is 
levitate; swim around into the camp at the far end; levitate; use the 
high ground to get started and then float gently down onto the 
Translocator.

Admittedly war's can't lev, but shamans can, and lev potions are also 
available and comparatively inexepensive.

Oh, and nothing sees itu by the docks as far as I can tell either.

I did it with my low level monk and shaman (pre invis, pre-FD). It was 
an adventure :-) Its actually not that bad. I'd say its easier than 
sneaking through PC.
