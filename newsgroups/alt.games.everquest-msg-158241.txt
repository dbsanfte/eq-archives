    On re-reading, you're right. I retract the comment.

    Any such system risks creating a "have-not" raider. A "have-not" is
someone who faithfully shows up every time, but because of random chance in
deciding loot never gets anything.

    In a points system, you cannot get a "have-not" raider - he'd have more
points than everyone else eventually. In an officer-award system, there's
usually a reason why someone is always passed over unless the officers
aren't tracking stuff closely.

    I call bullshit! We spend almost all our time in Vex Thal, or used to
before PoP. There was only one keyed non-LC cleric on the server, Loral, and
we took him to Emperor because he was an "informal" recruit. To the best of
my knowledge he's never been on a Vex Thal raid with us, and if you've ever
done a /who all cleric Lotus you'd see why he wouldn't be needed. We even
get some jealous shots from Wraith about our so-called cleric horde! So
unless you're talking about people asking him to do XP groups, or minor
timesink camping (like shards), I can't see anyone being called on "often to
help pull off a battle". Who is it, if you don't mind my asking?

    I could see members saying they wanted shards first, if he's being asked
to timesink camps. Saying he won't get other loot? Seems very odd. On recent
"day crew" raids (stuff people put together informally), we've killed
King/Queen in Chardok, and Trakanon a few times. Friends were invited to
come and have some fun on all of those, and loot was certainly given to
people outside the guild (Incarnadine BP for Chardok, Blood Ember BP and the
druid BP for the two Trakanons). Again, the only time I can see people being
excluded from loot on one of these things is if the loot was the objective
of the raid (like the cleric note from King, or teeth for MQ off Trak).

    Again, could you please be more specific in who it is and what event(s)
he was "used and screwed" at. It's my understanding that we don't do these
things. And as much as I dislike them, I find it very hard to believe some
of our competitors (Wraith, Vis) would do this because they're points-system
guilds and keep track of points for anyone considered a recruit or potential
recruit on a raid.
