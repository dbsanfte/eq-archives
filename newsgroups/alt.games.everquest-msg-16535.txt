There are all sorts of tools that would make it easier for guild leaders
to manage their guilds that VI doesn't  provide.  Personally I agree
with them, their coders time can be better spent creating features that
are useful to everyone.  If guilds want to manage their membership the
burden is on them to do so.  If I was leading a guild I think I'd write
my own database system to help me with the task once membership became
such that I couldn't keep it all in my head.  Pain in the butt?  You
know it, but that is a major part of managing a guild <g>, dealing with
all the hard work.
