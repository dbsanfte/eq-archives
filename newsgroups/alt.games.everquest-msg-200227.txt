I found in KC, it was usually safe to wait until the tank hit berserk
unless, as you said, multiple mobs were beating on him.

My worst problem, for a while, was str. When I had mostly skyshrine
armor there wasn't much str on any of it and I was running around with
about 82 str for a while. I had to go out and buy a tinker's bag to be
able to loot anything. Fortunately post velious upgrades added lots of
str dispite me not really picking them based on that.
