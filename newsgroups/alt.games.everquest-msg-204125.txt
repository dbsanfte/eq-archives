You are very wrong. An uber monk is generating something like 100-170DPS.
100DPS is considered "knight" level damage amongst the uber.

Bot9 and kitty crack will get you a couple more mana per tick. 

As far as I understand it the uber wizard is more constrained by
agro than mana or potential DPS. A wizard chaining his largest
nuke will do excellent DPS up to the point he gets summoned and
killed. Shaman have the same problem trying with their DoT's, which
is why people don't generally count them as a damage class.
