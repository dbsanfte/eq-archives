I can't really think of any advantage, but I know quite a few clerics 
remained bound there for quite some time after it was nerfed.  I know of 
at least two guilds that still had clerics bound there within the past 
month or so.

Yeah, I haven't been there in many, many months.  That place was fun, and 
was the place to play for all my unemployed guildmates, but once they 
nerfed it, we never really went back.  I still see people there, so there 
must be some advantages.
