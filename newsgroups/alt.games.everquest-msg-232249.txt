I don't know that's a mistake I haven't made yet. :)

It would be nice... but its not a big deal. And the lore has the solvent 
dissolving the augment...

On some level you should have to overcome the challenge that guards the 
treasure to get the treasure... beating a far lessor challenge (even if 
you do it 10x) doesn't merit it (this is why so much high end gear is no 
drop after all, to prevent the 5th level spiderling farmers from being 
equipped as well as the time raiders)... there should be a reward for 
actually playing the game ;)

LDoN has adventure points as currency that allow you to get the item you 
want with a predictable amount of effort; the level limits ensure that 
level 20s and 40s don't get benefit from gear that is the LDoN 
equivalent of god-raid-gear.

True, you *could* do 1000s of level 20 adventures buy the big dealie, 
and then level up, and use it... it bypasses the 'concept' but its 
hardly an abuse due to its extreme inefficiency.
