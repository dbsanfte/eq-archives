With my bard I wish Juggling instruments was one of them.

Memming spells/forgetting spells
Buying and selling.
Tradeskilling.
Targetting (beyond assist and groupmates)
Opening doors and activating switches.
Item abilities.
Questing (turn ins, combines)
Looting.
Item linking.
Turning buffs off.

Like it or not EQ is a mouse driven game.

The number of real issues here is quite a bit less than most people are 
willing to admit. There are a few gaps. But the great majority of people 
can make the switch without losing anything. The big exception is game 
support.

For myself, I prefer to use Mac Laptops. More network portable/friendly, 
less susceptible to virii, and all I really need on a laptop is Office, 
Web, & Mail.
