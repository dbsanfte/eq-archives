NORAID?

Unforunately (in the semi recent past at any rate, I'm sure 9/11 has had
some effect, you'd like to think so any rate) many delusional Americans who
usually claim questionable Irish roots saw the Provos as some sort of
heroic freedom fighters and donate to "Republican" causes accordingly.

Of course you can cover your tracks by claiming the money is for
"humanitarian aid" or some such gibberish but you can be sure (*) it's
really going to buy AK47s and Semtex.  Just like the two "asylum seekers"
recently arrested in London were manufacturing Ricin via state provided
benefits and accomodation much to the chagrin of the Guardian reading
chumps no doubt.

(*) Pre 9/11 at any rate.
