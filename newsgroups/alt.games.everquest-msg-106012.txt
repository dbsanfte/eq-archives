Ok, I play a paladin.  I bounce back and forth between soloing and grouping,
as my work schedule permits.  Soloing with us is a long, tedious process,
and one that lends itself to corpse runs.  I've sat and watched Anwyn, our
lead druid, quad kite and Root&Nuke.  It's pretty clear which one was at an
advantage.  I had to med between each pull.  She meds during pulls.  If you
can't play a druid effectively in solo, maybe you should learn how your
class works.
