    Level, level, level. You get more HPs, better inherent resists, more
mana, better chanelling, and new spells from levelling. The only things you
could even get before level 55 are the things on the first list (the
"General" abilities), and other than Run Speed and possibly WIS nothing on
the list is really worth the effort for a cleric. Some of the abilities you
can get at level 55 are interesting, but to get them you need six points in
General abilities, and the MINIMUM cost for one of the new type of abilities
(Archetype) is another two points. I found in Velk's that an alt XP point
required close to eight hours of being grouped and pulling, with 100% of
your XP going towards it. So do you think that getting, say, one extra mana
per tick (Mental Clarity I) is worth around sixty hours of doing nothing but
alt XP? Wait for level 60. :-)
