I'm in exactly the same situation, except that I don't even have my PoT 
flag (and I'm still 61). I dread having to grind AA, because with things 
costing 4 to 9 AA points, it basically means playing for days on end 
without seeing any advancement whatsoever... And 61 to 65 see the return 
of the hell levels. At the current rate (I'm hunting yard trash in PoN), 
I reckon I need around 300 kills to ding 62. This fills me with ennui 
too. I would start my epic, for something to do, but it would be a bit 
pointless since my guild doesn't have the firepower to finish it, and at 
the times I play, allied guilds who might help out are basically all 
offline.

I'm not quitting the game either, but suffice to say a lot of my single-
player games (and my guitar too) are getting a workout like they haven't 
seen in ages.
