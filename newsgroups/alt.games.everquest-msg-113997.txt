They do drop, but they are the rarest of the parts.

It took me this many kills to get a full set of Moss toe :

Rats : 112 (I had lots of extra ruined, got an undamaged quite early,
but had to wait for the 3rd "a mossy rat pelt")

Large Spiders : 37 (But I think that I killed too many)

Giant Spiders : 37 (And yes it was those pesky knee caps that kept me
waiting I got lots of other duplicates, but had to wait for these.)

So about 200 mobs in total.
I did the quests at level 32 so it was trivial to nuke the mobs (Finally
a fun use for earthquake or what ever it is called)

Oh and if there are no giant spiders, kill other giant critters to make
them respawn. I did a lot of this in off peak time when no one else was
killing things, so as a time saver I would Sow up and then train the
wasps to the guards, who as ever halfling knows are way too effective
<G>. This can save time and mana, but don't do it if the area is full of
hunters. 

Oh and /ooc the /loc of duplicate components and ask others to do the
same.
This can save you much time.

HTH,

Jim
