Did you manage to get enough corpses piled up at zone in to get a GM to
despawn the zone? That happened on a few servers back in the day that I
have heard about. On Tribunal, when I restarted there, the early 50's
did their first raid in fear and wiped and some came back barely 46 by
the time they'd recovered their corpses.

Nope. IMO, they haven't had the potential for that since websites like
EQAtlas went live. Nothing I have seen was more fun than exploring Lower
Guk without a map, when no one knew their way around. I was hoping LDoN
might recreate some of that particular fun but sadly they missed the
mark on that, going so far as to allow the mapping tool to work in LDoN
dungeons. Talk about gimping the expansion right from the start. I
wonder how many of the people complaining about the attack key move and
free backpack for newbies use maps in LDoN dungeons.

Shudder. Occasionally a guildmate takes a L65 pickup group when there's
no spot open in a guild group. Usually we then have to listen to an hour
or so of complaints of completely retarded play in guildchat.
