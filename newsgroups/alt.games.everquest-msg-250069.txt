    Well, I'm 65 and im in a guild that raids, and I can see two in there
that will affect me within 12 months.

    Aside from the obvious - debug the bugs that effect everyone before you
debug the zones that 3% can get into (fairly obvious I would have thought?),
how about:

    Kuloth's wishlist :)...

    -Spend 30% of development time going back through old quests and
updating the rewards so they're seriously worth doing  :). Put it in an
expansion if you like. I'll PAY for that. Want a scale to work from? A guy
that spends 200 hours questing at level 65 should have comparible gear to a
guy who spends 200 hours raiding at level 65. Make more group quests - you
didn't get it ALL wrong with PoP you know.
    -Get more new players and clump them together so they can group and
discover the game I used to love. What the hell is the point in me getting
another 200hp and breaking 7500hp if no noob SK's will be around to gawk?
Why should I finish my smithing when nobody needs what I'll make? EQ depends
on new players.
    -Delete the pacman from the maps
    -Scale Sense Heading with level - don't give people a perfect compass at
level 1.
    -Put faction back in. It used to be a large part of the game. Make it
worth working on.
    -Sure, fix raid content... Fix the non-top raid content so that the
people who only raid once a week can get within 12 months of the daily
raiders. The daily raiders will hate it at first, but at the end of the day:
they'll still be 365 days ahead, the next 50% of your player base will
become addicted again, and the last 40% will actually consider raiding.
You've spent so much on your raid content - make the most of it! How? Take
the timesinks out. Don't make it easier, make it less time consuming - where
possible. Make us kill everything - but fewer times. Up drop rates. Shortcut
key quests. We don't play as much and we're getting further and further
behind - don't forget us; we're your bread and butter.
    -Stop focusing on a tiny portion of your playerbase
    -Stop focusing on a tiny portion of your playerbase
    -Stop focusing on a tiny portion of your playerbase

Cheers,
James
