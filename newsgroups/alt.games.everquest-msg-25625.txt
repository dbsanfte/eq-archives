All I can say is get used to it. Last night I was in RV and a level 1 
drood comes up to me and says, "gimme 2pp for my spells, 1st lvl spells 
they give u suck". Needless to say I just gave the old /rude and went 
about my business. Said drood says, "man im petitioning you cant do that 
2 me". "Oh, ok", I replied. "Make sure you spell my name right: SEREFIN 
when you do." My fiance is ROFL laughing at this point. Drood says to 
me, "u cant do that man" and duels me. I figure objectivity lesson in 
the making and hit /d. Little whelp takes a whack at me and the deputies 
have themselves a little Halfling tar tar. Drood wakes up outside and 
gives a tell to my fiance: "did u dye 2?". My fiance laughs and comes 
outside. Drood doesn't like to be laughed at and tries to duel her. She 
accepts and being smart gets out of deputy aggro range. She then 
proceeds to root and dot. It doesn't take long for drood to bite the big 
one.

On the way out we shout a warning to the zone about said drood. We get 
several shouts about not coming into "their" home and terrorizing the 
locals (most replies less pleasant than that). 

I have since come to the conclusion that RV is the WORST zone to be in 
as far as beggars are concerned. That's not to say that ALL Halflings 
are worthless beggars, however, it seems that MOST of the begging I've 
come across has been there. Qeynos is coming in a strong second. 

I've been playing since commercial release and have seen this problem 
getting worse and worse. You can NOT have a simple conversation with 
someone in almost ANY city entrance nowadays. You WILL be begged from if 
you have anything but noob gear on. (And sometimes even then.) I really 
feel VI should do something about this. Although I fear there is nothing 
they CAN do at this point short of adjusting the PNP and making it a 
warnable/bannable offense. Perhaps with enough warnings or reports 
making that character "red". At the very least increase the size of the 
ignore list.

It's really getting to the point that I may switch to a PvP server just 
so I can whack the little bastards right from the get-go. I'm going to 
experiment this weekend and see if there ARE any beggars on the red 
servers. If not I may just give up and switch.

/em Sigh :(
