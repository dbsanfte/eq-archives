I myself am a sucker for people who have lost their corpse.  Being a
Ranger, I just feel compelled to run around searching for it with them.
And yes, a simple thank you is all I've ever expected for it.  Profuse
gratitude is usually what I get, so it's like a bonus.

I also find that, as a rule, there are more people in EQ who are willing
to help than those who won't.  Yes, there was some jerk who stood by,
using the /ooc to laugh at a friend and I while we were running for our
lives.  "Oh look!  The poor little rangers bit off more than can chew!"
But guys like that just aren't worth paying attention to.  It's the
people who pause and throw a Breeze on you, then wander on, the one who
stops and says "hey, need a weapon?" or even, the people who ask a fair
price for what they're selling or offer fair price for what you're
selling.  Those are definitely the ones who make this game fun.

And if you're not in a guild, give it a try.  I found a great guild on
my first attempt.  It's amazing how much effort these people go through
to help each other.  It truly makes the game experience more enjoyable.

And to all of those newbies I've given my old equipment to, thank you
for being thankful!
