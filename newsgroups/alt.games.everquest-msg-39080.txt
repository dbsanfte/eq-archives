Worth about 3500-4000pp on Lanys. It's a very nice weapon that will last a
monk into the 50's easily. I just banked mine after winning the roll on a
Sceptre of Mastery in the Kael Arena. It's 13dmg 21dly, and is just amazing.
I still use a knuckleduster in my offhand, and will keep the SoM even if I
get my epic.. it's actually better than the epic for offhand. What does this
have to do with the trance stick? Nothing.. I'm just still psyched that I
won it. :-)

Anyhow, if you want a lammy for your warrior sell the trance stick.. the way
prices go down, you can buy another trance stick when you want to play your
monk more.
