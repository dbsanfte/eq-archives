I've not played SWG so I'm not entirely sure about the nature of the
macroing you mean, but I'm fairly certain that macroing will not be an
option with EQ2.  The tradeskill system in EQ2 as described is very
complex, with a lot of random variables and "on the spot" decisions made
by the artisan.  

So they claim anyhow.  :)

Very much not understanding what you mean by decaying houses. O.o
