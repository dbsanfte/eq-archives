Of course.
Snare generates huge aggro,more than slows,as I learned in the last
weeks,since I got Earthcaller (procs 50% slow).
Mobs mostly seem to ignore slow even when it lands early,while
on the other hand a (resisted) snare at around 50% health make
them turn to me most of the time.
Not so sure about the slow aggro,maybe it has something to do with
that it is a proc,I notice Beastlords getting aggro all the time when
they (try to) slow.
