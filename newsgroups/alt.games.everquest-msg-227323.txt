Except it can be, and is.

To quote a wise man... "Who authorized you to speak for all of us?" ;-P

I like NBG. I always liked NBG. I always played NBG in groups I
set up. And I felt it fairer than the alternatives.

Shrug. Nobody makes you play my way ;) But nobody can make me play
yours either - and theres plenty I knew who would refuse to group
with a player who'd demand a class specific drop to sell when a
member of that class was in the group hurting. I've no idea who
is in the majority, and it may well be the /random crowd. As long
as theres a sizable minority playing NBG too its all good, for 
everyone ;)
