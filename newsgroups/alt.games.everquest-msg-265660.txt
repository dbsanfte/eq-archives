Abysmally.

By your own numbers it was an easy sell.  With 51% voting for one party and
48% for the other, and with (average) 8% voting for the party they're not
registered as belonging to, I'd say that's a pretty good indication that the
parties are very similar.

Odd, it's not bewildering to me.  I am in favour of equal rights for gays
(not better rights, equal rights).  I'm in favour of equal rights for women
(again, not better, equal).  I'm against marriage rites for gays.  Why?
Because I do not want the government interfering in religion.

If they want to shack up, fine.  If they want to go common-law, fine.  If
they want to get a piece of paper from the government that they're legally a
couple, fine.

However, if they want to get *married*, they'd better talk to their pastor,
their rabbi, intercessor, priest, or whoever, and find out what their
religion has to say about it.  It is religion's place to decide who resides
under the aegis of marriage, not government.
