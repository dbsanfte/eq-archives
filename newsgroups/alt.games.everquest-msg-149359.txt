My feelings exactly.  The funny thing is, that
if the new pets are each better than epic in one
or 2 areas, the epic will still be the best
all-around pet - 61 water may do better melee
DPS (likely as 60 water already does equivalent
melee DPS) but won't have the procs (including
stun) 4.3k hp and 50pt DS.  Similarly 62 air
might do equivalent DPS to epic and have nice
stuns, but still won't have the other damage proc
or 4.3k hp and 50pt ds, and so on and so forth.  
In fact, due to the blend of great DPS on xp mobs, 
massive DS, great HP and the stun proc mitigating
damage, I think the epic will still be THE solo
pet (or tank pet for all caster groups), and I still
intend to get my last few pieces.
