Stonebrunt is alot of fun to solo in.  Fire up the panic animal and go after
some pandas.  Do the wakizashi quest while you are there (look it up on
Allakhazam).

If you have luclin head to Dawnshroud.  Don't hang around the entrance to
netherbian lair.  Too many adds and trains there.  I usually set up shop
nearer to Sanctus Seru, pull a zelniak from nearby and snare-panic animal
all day long.  Watch out for the bugs there, they blind ya and they are very
agro.  Don't go after wolves till you are higher or you have a healer
backing you up, being a ranger you will trigger them walking over traps but
they won't agro unless they are one of the special named ones.  The wolves
hit hard, have high MR and have more HP than you'd think.  I've noticed that
most things on Luclin have high MR but just keep casting and pay attention
to where you are running.  Watch out for mushrooms too, nasty things but
some of the loot is worth 4 or 5 pp at merchant.  If you get a message on
screen saying "the ground beneath you sprouts mushrooms" you've triggered a
mushroom trap, if you are alone RUN!!! for the nearest zone, just go in any
direction straight till you hit a wall, there are zones in each wall.

Good Luck
