Hmm, either you are in the Exp group, and lying to preserve the
party line, or you aren't, and have swallowed the party line.

Turns out raids often involve a bardload of exp for a chosen few,
and none at all for the rest of the masses.  They may not be
"about" exp, but unless you are going after single target outdoor
spawn mobs, where you don't spend an hour clearing out trash
to get to them, there's exp there.  Did you think that just because
you didn't specifically come for it it vanished into the ether?

Somebody is getting (exp) rich on the backs of the proletariate
