Really?  Did you read the post I responded to (and quoted in my
response)?  Here, I'll give you another chance without even
requiring you to go back to the prior post:


/quote "Adam"
Warriors do not solo, they group with a healer. A warrior who has no
group skills is worthless.

Get out and start to group. You will gain levels quicker.

Well now, let's see.  First, he dismisses the OP's playstyle in a
particularly arrogant fashion.  Then, he insults the OP.  Then, ah
yes, there it is, he tells him what to do.

Now then, what was the point of your post again?

IMNSHO, anybody who disses somebody else for enjoying the wonder
of the game first time around is an unadulterated jerk.  There is
no later experience in EQ that is as fun as that initial voyage of
discovery.  All those madly racing wannabe-ubers who skip that are
shortchanging themselves out of an experience they will never have
another opportunity to enjoy.  Of course, that's their lookout.
But, they've got no fucking business trying to piss on somebody
else's fun.
