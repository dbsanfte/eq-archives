Aye, post 49, the necromancer HP-to-mana regen is far superior to KEI.
Especially if you're in raids where all you get to do is play mana battery.
If you get asked to in groups, just tell them it costs a peridot every time
you cast it.  It shuts them up quick and makes them go get KEI next time. :)

Of course, at the rate that these spells suck in on your health, it
certainly wouldn't hurt to invest in stamina, HP+, and mana+ items when
money permits.
