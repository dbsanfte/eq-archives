I logged onto test a week or so ago to look at the effects and thought it
was a mixed bag.  The root didn't look quite as good in game as it did on
screenshots, but maybe that's because my gamma is set pretty high.  The
Druid cold-based rain was horrific, but "Invoke Lightning" kicked butt.  A
high-level Beastlord showed me some of her spells and they looked awesome,
although I don't know what she was casting.
