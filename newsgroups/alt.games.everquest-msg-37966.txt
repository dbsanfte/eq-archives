Ah yes.  Where you went 'I feel that other groups have screwed me on loot in
the past, so I'm completely justified in screwing anyone else that I happen to
group with in the future'  and then simply repeated your position once more
about how if you have to split 100pp in rez money, druids and enchanters
should have to split the 1 pp they occasionally recieve from clairity.

Anyways, if that was the part you're referring to, you didn't address anything
there.

If not, then this time you can cut and paste.
