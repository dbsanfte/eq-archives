Yup, I learned that much to my chagrin, heh.  Made 16 with my necro a few
weeks ago (still 16 though, don't play him much) and was playing around with
FD, I got my ass handed to me on a platter at one point when I FDed, waited
for the hostile to walk off, and stood up, and he turned around and made a
beeline for me, barely managed to channel another FD through it.  I had
Leeched him earlier.

Remember that while FD, your natural mana and hp regen rate is cut in half
(from standing regen), but that regen and mana regen spells will still take
full effect, including the dark pact/lich line of spells.
