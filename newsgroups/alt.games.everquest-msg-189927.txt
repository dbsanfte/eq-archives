Lo, I have only been playing EQ about 3 months, and my ranger is 33 =
after about 8 days or so played.  I am getting to the point where I feel =
I need equipment upgrades, and am trying to concentrate on AC, Sta/HP, =
AGI, DEX, in that order (not sure if that is right, I generally melee =
stuff, and usually tanking with my brothers cleric).

Anyway, here is my profile I made in magelo:

I play on Venril Sathir, so there isnt an abundance of uber cheap items, =
and I would prefer to quest for items rather than buy them (I am =
currentley trying to do ivy etched but need to be a little higher for =
some of it).

Thanks for any replies, or any links etc.
