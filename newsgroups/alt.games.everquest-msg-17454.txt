To actually scroll back through the tells you've *received*,
use your mouse to click the up or down arrows on the scrollbar
on your message window, or press shift-PageUp to scroll back
a page at a time (and shift-PageDown to scroll back down to
the "current", or most recent, line).

To scroll back through the tells you've *sent*, press
shift-up-arrow several times (once for each message).

To scroll through the people who've sent messages to recently,
press "r" for reply (which brings up a "/tell LastPersonYouGotATellFrom"
prompt), then press the Tab key repeatedly to roll through the
list of "SecondToLastPerson", "ThirdToLastPerson", etc.
