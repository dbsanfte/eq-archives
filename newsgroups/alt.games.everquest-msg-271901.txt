The best I can find on short notice is:

If I recall correctly, the Xerox lawsuit had no merit, it was just
sour grapes because Xerox had no idea what their ideas were really
worth.  You could say Apple underpaid for the Xerox research, but they
did pay for it, and it was all legal.

In the end, Apple didn't steal anything.

Right.  But my understanding was that the GUI from Xerox PARC was
*extremely* basic and lacked such things as icons and overlapping
windows.

Apple did gobs of R&D on most of the elements that make up the modern
GUI.  Microsoft just copied.
