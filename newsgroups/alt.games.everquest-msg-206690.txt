They say that a 6 man group gets the same exp bonus as a 5 man group, 
and then distributes it as though each of the 6 people was in a 5 man group.

Simple math will show you that 6/5ths of 180% = 216%.  They worded it 
the other way in order to make the claim that "the 6th person is free" 
but thats just fiddling with numbers to make a point, both are identical 
ways to deal with the question.

BUT since you rarely see groups with all members at the same level, its 
very confusing to try and work in "6th man free" while manipulation of 
the numbers from 100%, 120%, 140%, 160%, 180%, 216% is much simpler.


For added fun, They could also claim that each person from 2 thru 5 
costs only 80% of their nominal split portion and the last one costs 
only 65% (I might have screwed up the math there) and give you even more 
of a headache trying to figure this all out.

How about this one:  per kill, one person gets 100%, two people get 60%, 
three people get 46%, four people get 40%, five people get 36% and six 
people still get you 36%.

So the second person costs you 40%, adding two people costs you 54%, 
adding three people costs you 60%, adding five people costs you 64% and 
adding six people also costs you 64%.

OR how about: adding the second person costs you 40, adding a third 
person costs you a further 14%, adding a fourth costs you 16% more than 
that, adding a fifth costs you still another 4%, and adding a 6th when 
you have 5 doesn't cost a thing.

But you could also assume each person brings the same average kill ratio 
to the table as everyone else.  This would mean the group bonus is all 
pure gravy:  2 people get 20% more exp, 3 people get 40% more exp, 4 
people get 60% more exp, 5 people get 80% more exp, and 6 people get a 
whopping 116% more exp.

This would mean the second thru 5th people each add 20% more exp, while 
the 6th person adds 36% more exp.

See how wording the exact same figures yeilds different seeming results?

Funny thing  is, experience tells me that pre change, soloing was 
usually less exp than two people (barring the very good solo classes), 
three people tends to be a bit better than two, and after that, 4, 5 and 
6 tends to actually drag exp per hour down.  This change seems 
deliberately designed to counter that tendancy so that groups of any 
size end up being just about as efficient as groups of any other size, 
the anomolies being that fourth person.. he's too expensive for his 
likely improvement in your kill rate, and the soloer, who sees 40% more 
exp than a pair... so the pair still needs to be a big improvement to 
win out.

A funny idea for soloers would be to group up and solo next to each 
other.  Then they'd get to use my last calculation system, so  6 soloers 
would be each seeing more than twice the exp per hour  as they would for 
doing the exact same thing  but without hitting the follow button.   
This assumes that the soloers are all identical in level and equally 
good at killing and that there are sufficient mobs that they aren't 
stepping on each other's toes and that they all manage to be in the exp 
range of each other for each and every kill, of course. 

Another thought is that the good old fashioned PB AE group might once 
again be the king of exp per hour, it always took 6 people to do this 
well, and the 6 man group is now looking at a substantial improvement in 
exp rate.

Food for thought
