From what I've seen, lizards are way, way, WAY more hated than DEs.  IE, 
I only had to kill a few orcs to manage to get to indiff with HHP/K 
without even bothering to turn in scalps. A day or two of turning in any 
gob ears I got shot me up to amiable.  The lizards I grouped with could 
kill for days on end with not a budge in the faction.  Never did manage 
to get one wolf-formed to see if that helped for turning in ears.
