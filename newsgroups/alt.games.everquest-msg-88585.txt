Well, talked to my friends about our options over the last few days.  One of
them immediately said "I wanna be the bard".  I'm feeling like I want to be
a tank/puller class, something like a monk or warrior.  The other two are
apparently still undecided about what sort of role they'd like to play.
With a bard and a tank, what sort of other classes should we be wanting?
I'm thinking something like druid and mage, cleric and wizard, something
like that?  Either combo would give us healing, nukes, and ports, but in
varying degrees.  Better healing and damage with the cleric/wiz, but more
buffs and a pet with the druid/mage.  What are some other possibilities that
would go well with bard/tank?

Alternatively, I was thinking about an all-caster combination.
Mage/mage/necro/chanter.  Any weaknesses there that I'm overlooking?  Since
they're all pet classes, I'm figuring a healer wouldn't be essential, thus
the lack of a class that can heal.  I see it as all four casters sending
their pets in to tank, with the necro doing dots (and other necro-y
functions), the mages nuking, and the chanter buffing the pets and doing
crowd control.  Again, though, I keep worrying that I'm missing a glaring
weakness.  Any thoughts on this combo?

Thanks again for your thoughts.
