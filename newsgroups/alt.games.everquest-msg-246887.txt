It's not so much that there are many guides who would intentionally
abuse the power if they had more. As you said, many genuinely want to
do more to help. However, many also don't realize that what they're
doing to "help" could harm the overall situation. Good intentions can
and do often lead to bad situations. It's hard to make a judgement
call on what "help" is genuinely beneficial overall when you don't
have a supervisor in the office to call on when you're not sure.
