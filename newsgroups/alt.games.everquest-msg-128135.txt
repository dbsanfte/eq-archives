The simple answer is the you're moving too fast for your Familiar to keep up
with you, mine often gets lost. There is a spell, Firetree's Familiar
Augment that gives your Familiar a speed buff. Basically, the graphic of the
Familiar is just that, a graphic, so long as the buff is active you're
getting the buff benefits ..

Safe hunting to you ...

Stevie.
