Now that you geniuses have so eloquently responded with nothing but insults,
let's get down to business.

The fact is that the naming rules are vague at best when it comes to what is
considered offensive. With this in mind, it would seem that the players are
at the mercy of the GM's whims (and other players) rather than a definitive
listing of what can't be used. It would seem that breaking the "naming
rules" is quite easy to do when these rules seem to be obfuscated.

With such diversity in the EQ community, tolerance goes a long way in
enhancing the gaming experience.
