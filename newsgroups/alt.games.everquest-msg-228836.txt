Summoned pets take 75% of the xp if they do *ALL* the damage.  Do 
even 1 point and they take no xp.

Charmed pets take up to 30% (IIRC) of the xp, depending on how much
of the damage they do.  It's on a sliding scale.

If you want all the xp do the following -
Charm a pet, send it in.
When target is near death break charm (invis yourself)
Finish off target and get 100% xp.
Finish off old pet (who should be beat up).
