I would have to agree with this last...probably why I have had no character
over 46 and have no trouble starting over...seems I enjoy the low level 1-35
or so game, much better than the 40+ game.  Although I suppose I should want
to try the planes someday =) ... been playing 2.5 years and never been.
Have had (in order) 29 cleric, 39 cleric, 34 enchanter, 14 wizard, 24
cleric, 46 paladin, and now have a 14 cleric (alt) and 22 paladin (main).
These last two are only two current characters...
