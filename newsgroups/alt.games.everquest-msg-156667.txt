I truly hate druids that quad kite in crowded areas.
I also hate druids that feel at level 34 - 40 they can kill more than 1 HG
at a time (and yes I am in a group and still getting GOOD exp from HG's as
well as the good cash, the level 50+ there, well that is another bitch).

If you are going to try and kill more than one mob, be sure you can at least
kill them as fast as every other group there so you are not holding 4 mobs
for 15 minutes when the groups there can kill 1 mob a minute and let the
spawn rate keep up.

If you are the only person at a spot, go for quading. But most people I know
(even some druids) hate when people do this. No not jealousy, since I
guarantee my rogue can kill those same 4 mobs much faster than you can, and
if I am grouped with you it would be even faster, so maybe try grouping?
