Thanks for your comments.

Well, I thought maybe that was true until I double-checked my skill in wind.
I recall training it at least once, and my skill level is currently at 13.  So it does have some
points, presumably mostly from singing Charismatic Carillion on umpteen vendors to get a
slight price improvement.   EQlog shows that I have trained it for 2 points and have gotten
11 skill ups... but none of those came from Aquatic Ayre.

I had just bought  Tarew's Aquatic Ayre the other day hoping to mainly use it for
training, but it's just not working.

Next experiment will be to try singing it without the instrument to see if I can get skill ups.
