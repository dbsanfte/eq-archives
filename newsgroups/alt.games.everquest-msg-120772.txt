Actually you did try to provide an example of how someone had "exploited"
guards in the past, which is what I asked you to do. Did I thank you for
that?

And this is what I meant by "accidently".  As in the guard got near your
mob by accident (whether you brought it to him or not).  An easy enough
concept to grasp, I thought.  Didn't see the word "wandering" in your
story either, but I managed to get your point.

Don't worry.  None of the stuff he mentioned doing is against the rules.
So no trouble will come to him.

Proving, you know, that you're a self-righteous twit who thinks he should
impose his own set of rules on others and who resorts to name-calling when
anyone calls his BS "BS".  A rules judge, just like I said.

Well as we all know you see an "exploit" under every stone, so in your
world there probably *is* an overwhelming mountain of them.  If Verant
wants to regulate a certain behavior, you'd be amazed how a rule could be
written that would apply in multiple instances. For example: "Charming a
mob that is fighting a guard in an attempt to gain experience for that mob
is not allowed."

You yourself have shown us why the rule list is *not* very long.  If
Verant sees behavior they don't like they will change the code. Did I
thank you for that example?

At the end of the day, that fact remains that if a *tactic* is possible
and it is not against the rules, one is not likely to get into trouble for
it (at least the first time).  After the several days of this thread I
won't say impossible. Because who knows, maybe someday someone like you
will slip through the filters and get a guide job.

In fact, the number of rules regarding "exploits" is not one.  It is zero.
There is no rule on the list that includes the noun "exploit" in the sense
that you have been using it in this thread.  The two occurences of
/exploit/ are:

1. "You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest ..." (verb)

2. "... you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug
..." (adjective)

Your use of "exploit" as a noun relates to your desire to make any
*tactic* that's not in your personal repertoire illegal.  Rule #11 applies
to bugs, as in spells or weapons that have unintended effects.  And since
everything that falls under rule #11 is by definition a bug, it will
eventually be fixed by Verant.  The window of time in which a rule #11
violation can be made is pretty small: on the order of the time between
patches.

You want to apply rule #11 in a much broader sense, e.g.: Guards exist
only to protect newbies, therefore attempts to use them in any other
fashion is an "exploit".  Sorry, Mr. Rules Judge.  No more legislating
from the bench for you.
