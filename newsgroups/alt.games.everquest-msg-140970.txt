Oy, tell me about it.  My computer's still got it's original video card.  
It doesn't like the Bazaar much - this is going to make my computer it's 
bitch and make me cry.  I see 512 is the minimum amount of memory, too.  
Time for yet *another* upgrade.  But at least my processor is the 
minimum required.

And I'll finally be able to afford that GeForce 3! :D

Damn, those are pretty.  It's like Myst for EQers.  One thing I'm glad 
about is the no-eq1-chars-allowed rule.  I wouldn't *mind*, as it'd 
allow my rogue to get even prettier (although I see they're continuing 
strong in the trend of stupid hats ::eyes the back of the elf's hat::), 
but otoh I'd hate to see them letting a bunch of level 60s into that 
fresh new world - nekkid or not.  Oops - although they are letting those 
damn brats ::ahem:: I mean, suckers on Legends have the first peek.  
Blah.  Wish *I* had daddy's credit card. ;p

And speaking of nekkid, I foresee a LOT more shims in EQ2 ::eyes elf 
again:: :D

Ryou
(may take this opportunity of making that female rogue she's been 
wanting...)
