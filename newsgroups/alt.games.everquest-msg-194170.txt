How could I have forgotten Mononoke-hime? DOH! 

Got a great deal at best buy the other day; bought SA, KKDS, and CitS,
and got Mononoke free. Sure, I already have Mononoke, but it's still a
good deal. They didn't have Totoro though. :(

If you want beautifully depressing, he also had his fingers in Grave of
the Fireflies.
