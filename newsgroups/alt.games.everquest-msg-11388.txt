I would agree but I saw no casts and the Mobs HP bar did not jump up at
all.
The runts seemed to either have like 1000 HP or
Regenerate at only slightly less than the amount of damage I could do.

Plus it only seemd to be the runts.
I took out a couple of the others with runts joining in.
The other mobs did not get healed, and the runts did not do much harm to
me so I killed the other mob (also blue to me). Then I tried my hand at
a runt, but it was no use.

All very odd.

Oh this was on Drinal.
