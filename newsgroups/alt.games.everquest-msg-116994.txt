I'm not depressed about my class, I'm defensive.  :-)

Just seems like there has been quite a it of druid bashing lately, so
I might tend to be a bit sensitive on the matter of druids and our
abilities.

Actually, if you're a druid at higher levels, you get used to watching
the casters health around you, because we're usually the back up
healers.  Get's to be a habit.

Well, maybe it's because my main is a druid, but I'm ALWAYS snaring.
Even if I have a druid in the group who wants to snare.  It's a good
way to keep aggro, which keeps aggro off the casters, and it's better
safe than sorry.  And what the hell else am I going to do with my mana
in a group.  :-)
