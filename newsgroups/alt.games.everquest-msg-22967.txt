>Are they all drop only?

    Not all. If the spell is 50 plus and from Velious, it is drop only. If
it from Kunark, then it may not be drop only. From levels 51 to 54, there
are four dropped spells: Reckoning, Yaulp IV, Upheaval, and Death Pact.
These four spells can be turned in at a quest NPC in FV and/or OT outpost to
get a random scroll, also 51 to 54: Sunskin, Heroic Bonds, Word of Vigor,
Unswerving Hammer of Faith. The other six 51 to 54 spells are all on vendors
in FV and OT outpost, and include most of the "useful" spells: Remedy,
Divine Light, Symbol of Marzin,Heroism,  Annul Magic, Dread of Night.

    Past 54, there is a small subset of spells on the vendors - the rest are
dropped. Exile Undead, Banish Summoned, Reviviscence, Bulwark of Faith,
Antidote, Celestial Elixir are on the cleric spell vendors. Trepidation is
on the necromancer spell vendors - get a friend to buy this for you in
Cabilis or the OT outpost. Paralyzing Earth can be *researched* by
enchanters and wizards, and scribed by you. Wake of Tranquility is actually
one of the enchanter 51 to 54 quest result spells, so if you have enchanter
scrolls you can turn them in for a shot at this. No level 60 spells are on
vendors.

    I felt the same way at first, as this WAS a feature that attracted me to
being a cleric. But as you will find, the situation isn't so bad....

    In Kunark, spells drop in certain zones. In Skyfire are many of the
55-60 spells, or so I've heard (agoraphobia with the cleric, as you've
heard). They are random drops there. In Chardok and Sebilis, the 51 to 54
quest spells are dropped at about the same rate as gems - so fairly often.
What spells drops is totally random. In the "basement" of Sebilis, many 55
plus spells are dropped. Also, the Emperor in the Crypt area of Seb usually
drops one level 60 spell when killed. As a rule of thumb for the 55 plus
spells, a mob will drop spells equal to its own level. Since at 55 plus you
will likely visit Seb a lot ANYWAYS, you will slowly gather your spells. And
then you'll find.....

    Most of our dropped spells are so much garbage at 55 plus. I have made
reasonable use of Exile Undead, Mark of Karn, Paralyzing Earth,
Reviviscence, Bulwark of Faith, and Naltron's Mark at level 58. Only the
Marks are spells you'd have to go out of your way to get, and they are
admittedly rare - I paid 10 K for Naltron's, and 1 K plus a useless 55 NEC
spell for MoK. If I'd had a Velious BP, I wouldn't have needed MoK, either.
Looking to levels 59 and 60, I can see using Celestial Elixir and Aegolism -
and Aegolism was easy to get as it can drop off any level 60 plus Velious
mob and is quite common. So really, the only one you need to be on the watch
for is Naltron's Mark - and believe me when I say you'll recoup the money
spent on it QUITE quickly. Using only one peridot to Symbol an entire party
rather than the three plus I used before.... wow.

>Or camping EC auctions to try and buy em
>(just as tedious)?

    Most people sell the 51 to 54 quest spells in EC for 50 plat to 100 plat
each on my server. They can frequently be found on vendors as well - they
sell for 15 or so, and some people hate EC. ;-) The results of doing the
quests are very infrequently sold in EC, and usually you have to do the
quest and take your chances. If you go to Seb, these spells drop often
enough that you WILL very quickly fill out your collection of them. Quest
spells even drop off the frogloks in Trakanon's Teeth you need to kill to
get your Seb key.

    The 55 plus spells are less frequently sold, although now they are
cheaper and more common than a short while ago (drop rate recently upped).
Since you're the outdoorsy type, try hunting in Skyfire - you should get a
nice bundle of spells that way. And good luck!
