Yes that was my idea.. but frankly I am toooooo lazy to do swapping
like that for a piddly 1pp (which is 10% savings on a 10pp item) so
it would only be worth doing, if at all, when buffing up whole
raids worth of forces.

Lets say I have the group but not the mass Aego.  And the raid
is a full 10 groups worth of force.  Item works as expected, 10%
savings.  Thats 4 peridot saved.  Ooooooh, pinch me, 40pp.

LAME item line.

Only class I can think that would really find this useful might be
chanters, who blow thru far more peridot chain runing MA in
really nasty encounters than I will in a month of raiding...

Without Aego, by the way, I spend about 14 peridot fully
buffing 10 groups to raid strength... thats 10 'dot on 10
Naltron's Marks, plus Marzin on MA, SA, Chanter and ME.
Average savings per full buff of this massive group?  14pp.
Wow.

What am I a bard, to be swapping items around like a
Juggler on shroooms?
