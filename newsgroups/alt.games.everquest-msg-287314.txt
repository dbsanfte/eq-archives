Welp,

After fooling around in EQ2 maybe 5 hours a week, tops, for the last
few months (since it started getting too cold to go to the beach here
in NY, so .. end of september actually), i finally made my way to the
game's answer to the enchanter of EQ1. And i love it! By "love" i mean
"i really dislike the way we were treated in EQ1" and "I think this is
how it should have been all along - this is intuitive."

The "character" of the class has evolved a bit - from "enchanter" in
EQ1 we have a good and evil version - illusionist and coercer,
respectively. Most classes from EQ1 splintered  into a good/evil
version, where typically the divide is on "light" vs "dark" magic, not
offense versus defense. That distinction is rooted in the genre of
fantasy itself, so you can check it out without hearing my
editorializing.

The major difference between the illusionist (good) and coercer (evil)
is that the bad guy can dominate the mind of his opponent (charm) and
the good guy can create a doppleganger of himself that will cast
damage and stun spells (smart pet). Pets suck, AI sucks, and there's
no way you'd get me to play the illusionist (though they get all the
illusions - coercer only gets a few). Hence, I'm a coercer. I had been
leaning toward coercer anyway because in EQ1, in the 50's when we got
"titles" (that only showed up in a /w all enc 51 65 query), coercer
was higher than illusionist (and beguiler and phantasmist too).

The coercer can do most of what my enchanter (Faza in EQ1) used to be
able to do. It seems they "got it right" and i'm sorry to report i'm
only noticing this now. I didn't play any other EQ2 classes enough (by
20 they were pretty dull) to notice that they were really very well
balanced and refined. All i noticed by playing other classes up to 20
was that the game is far more solo-able while being far more group-
able too. Each class has something to offer a group *and* everyone can
solo in varying degrees - all of them. And the tradeskill professions
offer a non-combat experience that's mostly puzzle-collection based
gameplay. So i like all of that, but it made me think EQ2 was just
dumbed-down EQ1. It is, but it's still more fun than EQ1. That's a non-
raider's point of view (haven't raided in EQ2, didn't enjoy raiding
post-luclin in EQ1). And it's not really dumbed-down so much as the
baseline requirements for competency are far lower, but an excellent
player will shine through just as brightly. And if you're doing pickup
groups, that's what you want.

The alternate advancement in EQ2 offers very respectable customization
and the player can begin it from lvl 10 (not 50) - and it runs
parallel normal xp, not in place of, so you level up as you refine
your skills. That's a nice improvement. I spent my points in the
"chronomancer" line, a special enchanter-only ability that allows my
spells to cast faster.

I'm not trying to convince anyone here to play EQ2 so much as i'm just
looking to express that certain griefs from EQ1 are vindicated in EQ2.
I've only noticed it as i've become serious about playing a coercer.
For example - in EQ1, when i charmed anything (and every time i had a
spell that would charm the mobs i was fighting, which is most levels
but not all [ugh!], i would...) i would have to *stare* at the charm-
pet window because it could break any second. Is that fun? To be on
edge so much? I didn't think so. What was fun was the fact that very
few people would be as diligent with their pets as i was, and as a
result i had a reputation as an excellent charmer. In EQ2, we have the
same risk - random charm breaks (though the AA to keep charms holding
longer is available from much earlier on [woohoo!]). But when charm is
wearing off, we get notice. It's about 3 seconds where the screen
color-shifts for a split second and then the mob is stunned for a
random duration, usually just enough time to cast a stun or a root. Is
it less fun that charming is easier? Nope. It just shifts my focus
onto the world around me, the conversation, the cat that jumps on the
keyboard, etc. Why did it have to be a staring contest to be a good
charmer?

I feel better =P
