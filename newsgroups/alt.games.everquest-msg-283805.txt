Most necro's, like shaman's casting canni, assume you as cleric are
not going to heal them, so don't.  If they die, they die.  Maybe
they'll ask for your help next time, maybe they won't.  As cleric I
tell everyone in group that the tank is my primary focus, if I have
mana to heal others I will, if I don't I won't.

Considerate shaman's hotkey canni so you don't think they're getting
pummeled.  Necro's I never even talk to unless they initiate, as a
necro I understand that side too.
