1. Make the Warden of Tunare quest your #1 goal.
2. Keep defense and your spell skills maxxed.
3. Ignore 2hb. Almost all good druid weapons are 1hb, but ironically
the epic is 1hs.
4. You need to be a master forager to complete the epic quest.
5. Unless you plan to exclusively solo, specialize in alteration.
6. Druid aren't all about nuking and healing. Learn how to use stuns,
dots, snare, harmony, charm animal, fear animal, sunbeam, root, damage
shields, etc. effectively.
