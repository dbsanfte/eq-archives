People die every day. People lose loved ones every day. Out of all of
the many thousands that face such circumstances, how many get a lawyer
and file a suit? Her reaction is NOT "normal", and it to the objective
observer appears to be another case of shifting blame and making a
buck at the same time.

Her actions speak for her feelings. She wants to blame someone, and
seek financial redress for a percieved wrong. Devastated or not, she
has shown her true character. She is placing a dollar amount on her
dead son.

>However, her motivation to sue, could arise from a number

And still be the devasted mother you describe. The two are NOT
mutually exclusive.

More likely she believes that anything other than her own inaction or
her son's actions are at fault.

As much as I hate lawyers, she still had to agree to and enter into
the suit of her own free will. She isn't trying to help anybody but
herself. She should have worked harder to prevent the event that did
happen.

>--she could sue without expecting to win but in order to gain

What cause? She neglected her troubled son, and through inaction
contributed to his eventual death. The only "cause" she is championing
is the removal of blame from herself, and anyone else who turned a
blind eye to the boys troubles.

BINGO!

>And so forth. For us to simply look at the fact she sued, and then

Her actions speak for themselves. What is not fair is the trashing of
EQ (or any other entertainment product) over a single isolated case.
She has attached her name and reputation to a course of action that is
sick and disgusting. She is attempting to profit off of the death of
her own son. 

>My reactions have a lot to do with the fact this subject was discussed before, 
>many months ago, and the vile comments directed at the dead guy and
>his mom, were truly shocking. 

The guy off'd himself. He doesn't deserve any respect or sympathy. He
threw away his life. The people who deserve respect are the ones that
go on living in the face of mental or physical handicaps/problems. 

His mother is claiming that some incident in-game triggered his
suicide. So she is in fact attempting blaming you, me, and everyone
else that plays EQ for her sons death. 

>The self-righteous twits were crawling all over themselves to denigrate

If I don't feel sorry for him or his mother, and if I should go so far
as to feel contempt for them both, nothing is going to "come 'round"
to me. The only "self-righteous twit" I see is this so called mother
who refuses to accept responsibility, and seeks to lay all of the
blame at the feet of a PC game.

People don't wake up one day and decide to end thier lives. It took 21
years to make him the boy/man that he was. The people closest to him
(eg his mother) had time to get him the help he needed. If he refused
to accept the help, then that was his decision. If the people close to
him ignored his problems, then they have to live with that for the
rest of their lives.
