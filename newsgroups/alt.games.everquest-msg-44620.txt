I think that most people who have a LOT of money simply practice capitalism.
They win a roll, go to East Commons, wait for a good price and then sell it.

While in EC some of them might see something they really do not need, but at
a great price so they buy it, then sell it later at a much better price.

But me?  I usually give good equipment to an alt, or to a friend.  I gave a
20k SK-only weapon that drops over by the Hand room in Karnors to a friend
before I realized how much it was worth.  I wish I had not been so generous.
