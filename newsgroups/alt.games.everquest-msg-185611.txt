#1 on the list of "Rules for being a good Republican" (I apologize in 
advance if there are any republicans who are also intelligent and 
thoughtful on this list):
 
1) You have to believe that the nation's 8-year prosperity prior to W's
administration was due to the work of Ronald Reagan and George H. Bush,
but that today's growing deficit and rising gas prices are all Clinton's  
fault.

I'd post the rest of the rules (pulled from Democrats.com...I'm
"independent" but I still found it a good read) because they are mostly so
dead-on you don't know whether to laugh or cry, but I didn't want to
hijack this thread.
