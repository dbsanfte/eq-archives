It does, to everyone else. Just not to you. I'm sorry, but I'm not
going to bother explaining it again.

Ah, so you admit that you have specifically attempted to weasel around
a kill file. That's refreshing.

From this paragraph, it's obvious that I know better than you do what
a kill file means. If I kill file someone, it means I don't want to
have to wade through any more of their posts. From the perspective of
my newsreading software, I want that person to cease to exist. And I
don't give a crap how they feel about that.

The contradiction in that paragraph is nothing short of stunning.


Tell ya what, though. I've avoided it so far, but I'm putting you in
my kill file now. Let's just take it as a given that I *already*
*know* that you don't care. That will save you the effort of changing
your screen name yet again (and thereby proving that you're an idiot,
yet again) to tell me that you don't care, which all the people who
already have you in their kill files will no doubt appreciate.
