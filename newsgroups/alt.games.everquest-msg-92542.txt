With all the new Luclin weapon drops, prices are going through the floor. At
19th level, I bet you could find a Velium Etched Mace - the one that drops
off Razerhoof, for less than 100pp. Probably less than 50, or whatever
vendors will give you - 7/22, +3WIS/STR - not a bad Druid weap. Fast, so
skill ups are good too.

If you get a little more to spend, I bought a Journeyman Stick for 600pp -
nice for getting aggro. I gave that to my friendly tank since Tashing snare
dumb MOBs didn't seem to help much :). Also see Dark Embers auctioned for 1k
now.
