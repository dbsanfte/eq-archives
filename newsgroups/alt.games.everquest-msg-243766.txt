I was in Skyshrine the other day, soloing for faction, and I decided
to check out the next area past the maze. To my surprise, it seemed
that the maze layout had been changed. My backspace maps's simple
guide through the maze no longer worked.

Is this just some bug or has the maze really changed? Has anyone else
run into this?
