Heh - got teamspeak up and running for my friends.  Have one problem
however, one of his machines transmits more clearly but I can't keep
it from echoing what other people say.  I know about the 2 different
microphone settings in windows and to mute the playback one - but that
didn't help.  Switching to his other comp gets rid of the problem,
but results in his voice being scratchy and low volume.  I'm about to
do some serious FAQ and Forum reading this morning.

Worse is EQWatcher, that an be set to read tells aloud.  He discovered
that "Wuuuuuuuuuuuuu Huuuuuuuuuuuuu" makes a sound very like a bong hit.
