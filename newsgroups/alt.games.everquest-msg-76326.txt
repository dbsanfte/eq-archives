Hope you got his OK to posting his private email to you here...

This is the problem, I think. If he came here expecting Nethack, he
will be sorely disappointed. They're both CRPGs, but there ends the
similarities. It's quite possible that EQ quite simply isn't a game
for him.

Another idea, which was suggested by someone else, is to get him to
start a char on your server, and showing him the ropes there. Might
have a chat with him about trying other classes too, which was also
mentioned elsewhere in the thread.

Rune, fully justified as usual!
