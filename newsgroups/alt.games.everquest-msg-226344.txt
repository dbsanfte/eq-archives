Maybe it's something else then. I can download movie files all day long,
browse, get huge patches, etc etc but sometimes when playing my usb mouses
seizes and i have to take it out and put it back in again, and sometimes
it's my nic (smc ezconnect usb, win xp) that seems to lock up... and this
happens regardless of straight everquest in windows mode or eqindows, if i
run 2 accounts. If i don't run eq my system is fine with being up for days.

I might try installing a different nic, but to me it's like everquest is
doing something odd to the system at a low level. I have that system
notifier thing turned off and no background tasks. SWG worked fine, as did
other online games, and EQ seems fine in normal mode, so I am stumped! I
just wish I was more of a PC guru so I could trouble shoot.
