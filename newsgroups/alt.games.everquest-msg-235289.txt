Play on FV where almost everything is droppable, those ornate paterns are
still expensive. (I know trying to get the leather leg patern). Items are
still pretty close to what I have seen on the other servers I have played
on. The main difference is the level 1's in full ornate or some such. Of
course there are no zerks 55+ yet to make the zerk ornate, but should be one
or two by the time I get home from work today I would guess.

I do think that the required level would be good, also to make the
recomended levels on weapons mean something for the damage.
