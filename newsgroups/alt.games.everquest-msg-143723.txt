My understanding is that in this situation, the warrior tanks and you assist
him.  Cleric stays back a bit as to not draw the aggro.  The warrior was
wrong to keep looting during a frenzy.  Try again with another group and ask
in group what they would like your role to be.  Don't get discouraged and
get back in there and fight!  =)
