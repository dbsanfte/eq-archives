My enchanter spend quite a bit of time in unrest, exclusivly from 19 to
27 and then off and on to about lvl 29. Yes I died a few times, but
really learned to run an enchanter in the process. I'd recommend you
hang in there, it is a hoot and a good learning experience.

I also used my AoE mezz there quite a bit, but it was also during this
time I put it away also. Your single target mezz will be your workhorse
here, it lasts longer, (I cant remember the names of the 19-24 lvl mezz,
it was a long time ago). If there was a crowd I'd mezz the lot, and
single target mezz the left overs. If one jumped me, I would keep trying
to mezz, if I had a crowd on me, I'd head for the zone.

Contrary to what some people on this newsgroup may say, be very careful
about using color flux here, (as well as other dungeons). The effect
goes thru walls/ceilings/floors and you can bring the house down on you. 
Use it only if you need to get away to zone, (and let people know you 
are pulling a monster train).

Hmmm tahani, well if you have the time go ahead. But in massivly
chaotic areas like unrest I usually try to hold back, keeping my
attention on the mezzed mobs, and watching for adds. Party composition
is very important, if we are composed of mainly casters, tashani away,
melee classes, hold back. But I see it as maily a time and attention
thing, I will explain my approach in a bit.

I kept one of the whirl spells handy, they help quite a bit on the
casters.

In dungeon situations, I put away my int items and pull out my
charisma stuff, I want my charisma as high as I can get it. Since I have
clarity, (or breeze) I am not so concerned about total mana. Rarily do I
apply a dd or dot, I try to keep my mana at a nice even level, mezz,
mezz, watch, watch, and more mezzing when needed. 

Oh finally, be sure to recognize and find good groups, that understand
or can be made to understand what you are doing. I have died more than a
few time when people swatted or blasted mezzed mobs in the middle of a
battle.
