In other words, when I get really high level and want to get friendly
with dragons, get a dwarf loving uberguild :)

I'm bored with Overthere and can't get group in Dreadlands yet :)
Besides, my first goal is to get the frozen dorfs to like me.

I killed kodiaks with a 40 warrior for a while last night. Exp was
acceptable, I got Icetooth's claws (I was willing to let him have them
but he said we should roll :) ) and now with the suggestions about
charming further down in this thread... I might either kill drakkel
wolves or try to use one as a pet.

As long as I can find some toes for loot, I'll be content :)

(And then there's those blue faced orcs...)
