My mage friend made most of the money for it by pulling a Bazerker to the
Great Saprophyte's Lodizal. And selling off that killer manastone.

Server politics lesson:  Bazerker and his bot cleric and a couple friends
have killed Lodizal over 50 times, after about the 3rd time it was pure
greed that kept them going.
My friend killed the saprophyte about 8 times over the weekend and sold 3
copies of Remove Curse for 4k each (and a few of the earrings for like 500).
Bastard wouldn't even trade me a copy for the sorcerous bowl of mine that
he's got on loan.

Oh, and I took advantage of the saprophyte spores to do the quest for saving
the mutants.  It's fucking broken.  The quest reward is a sv poison/disease
necklace with clickable (when equipped) cure disease, there's only one
problem.  It's not a necklace, it's clr/dru/shm / all, but it's not
equippable in any slot.
