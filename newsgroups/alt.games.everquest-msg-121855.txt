Id probably wander up to skyfire and see if theres a necro who wants to
group. Youre probably a bit low to camp the names spawns that drop the high
level spells, but you could pull wurms, mature wurms, wyverns, bottomless
feeders. Chromos are easy enough, but their dispell can be scary if you dont
have jboots or enhanced run speed.
