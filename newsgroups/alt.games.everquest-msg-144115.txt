I remember an old druid discussion, when his example of druids being "weak"
soloers (lol) was that his 58 twink monk could solo endlessly in the grey,
killing at a faster rate than his 60 druid.

I've been in ssra pretty much 24/7, so generally camp at the zoneline.
Anyway last night we were doing AoW so upon zoning out into the grey seeking
a port, i decided to put hughes claims to the test.

Level 58 "twink" without epic.. maybe he's well geared for a twink.. but I
really doubt he's got endgame items,   anyway that, versus -
level 60 "main" with epic, 132 AA levels (well 131, I dinged again after the
aow kill/ringwar), "endgame" crown, choker, belt, nToV BP (fungi in
inventory).. imo primal is an endgame weapon too, other misc stuff - e.g the
ensnare stick from Tunare 14/19 (primal is 15/20), TS, primal bat, ulaks and
other assorted weapons + AoB, and self DS

Funny that I couldn't endlessly solo, don't ya think?   I also remember the
first time i ever went to the grey (with a druid friend), and watched her
solo 8 mobs in 1 go by root dotting.  Btw for info, after the 4th mob I was
at a hp level that I probably wouldn't have attemped another solid blue (Id
rather bind/regen to kill it comfortably, than risk killing it, and have to
feign with me very low hp, and the mob very low hp)

So then I loaded my snare weapon, (with avater up) snared the mobs, repeated
ID until the mob was feared, and "fear kited" it. Guess what, even that
wasn't without downtime, and damage taken from mobs while ID wasn't
working/fear was resisted

Btw 200 mend/ID skill, every thing else maxed(1hb, offence, dual attack etc)
and ambidexterity
