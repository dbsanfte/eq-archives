Yeah, it's best to think of BooBoo as a DoT, not a pet.  He's little
better than a speedbump, otherwise.  Cute as a button, though!

If you're looking for a pet that can do damage, charming is indeed the
way to go.  Just remember, regardless of the compliments they give you
whilst charmed, your pet is not your friend.  They will turn on you
and try to rip your throat out if you drop your guard.  However, with
proper caution and a little practice, charming is a great way to get
exp.  I wish I'd started earlier.
