Hmm, thanks Jekke, I learned something new!  Never seen MOK/MOKs used yet.
Either the clerics don't have it or most clerics I guess don't think it's worth
it.  Sound like a good cheap form of melee regen to me, every little bit helps.
Or I assume I haven't seem it yet, does the melee get spammed with heal messages
when they hit the mob?
