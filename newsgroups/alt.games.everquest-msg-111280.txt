One warning, from when I was scouting out the place for a raid (that fizzled
due to general laziness...) there's a swirlspine up in the peak of
Undertow's temple right above the altar, so don't go too far into that room.
(the narthex with the pillars is safe though).  I'm also not sure about a
few of the named that weren't up (ok, all of them except Phinny and
Estrella, who DO see invis) so be careful if any of the other names are up
and con first.
