I think I just attract weirdness.  For the second time in a week or so, my
name's been mentioned to a guild for something I didn't do.  First the name
stealing thing, and now this...  I don't think I'm offended by what happened
to night, but it sure struck me as strange.

Anyway, the story:

Tonight I was, for once, playing my Warrior (52).  A guildmate and I started
up a group with me as group leader.  I'm a competent group leader when I
know what to expect, and I'd done this particular dungeon several times
before.  Cakewalk.  We went in and got started.

Before long, the Bard in the group began pulling while I was trying to pull
(I'd already been designated as main tank).  I'd gotten no more than 2 mobs
at a time at this point.  I said in group to please stick with one puller,
the group briefly discussed it, and we decided I'd do single/double pulls,
and he'd get any lull-required pulls.  That'd let me pull, which I love to
do, but it'd also keep us safe.  (No Enchanter, no Necro, no Cleric or
Paladin.)

But he kept pulling ahead of me or at the same time, which was getting
risky, so I asked him in PM to please let me keep making the pull calls.  It
was safer that way.  He agreed, we talked a little; I explained how I rarely
get to pull and I love it, which is why I wanted to do at least the singles.
We worked really well as a pulling duo after that.

About 20 minutes later, the Bard began to start to make calls for the group,
basically working into leader role.  The only problem was that role was
competently filled by me.  Confusion began, including the group briefly
getting split up.  In /tell, again, I politely asked him to please let me
lead the group.

No reply, but he backed off and things went smooth again.

(This is a good point to say the Bard was a fantastic Bard, and an amazing
Bard mezzer.  I would group again with this guy, regardless of who's
leader.)

A few minutes later, I got a tell from someone who asked if I was in an LDON
with the bard, and I said yes.  A /who showed he was a 65 Warrior in the
Bard's guild.  Then he asked me if I was having trouble with agro.
Surprised, I said, "Sorry?"

He said, "You complaining about agro control?"

"Not complaining, no..."  Agro hadn't even come up in fact.

"Are you having trouble maintaining it?"

Figuring it was a higher Warrior going to offer advice, I joked, "Well, I
*am* a warrior. :D"

"Right."

He then went on to tell me, "Don't complain about Warrior agro in groups, it
makes Warriors look bad."

...

What?  Well, that was very out of the blue.

Apparently, somehow, my requests to the Bard (which were in tell and polite)
got sent through the purple monkey dishwasher machine until this third party
guy thought I was complaining about agro issues to my group.

And he decided it was necessary to correct me on it.  Even though he wasn't
there.  And agro had never even been *mentioned.*

I've been (as I soon told the Warrior guy) a Warrior three or four years
now.  I'm used to the fact that agro *will* shift, and I do my best to
handle it, and I don't make an issue out of it.  (I may be vocal on the
subject here, but I wasn't there.)  After explaining that, I asked where
he'd heard about this--in /guild or in a /tell.

Quote him, "That's not important."

Quote me, "I think it is, actually, since I was mentioned by name."  He
never did specify, though, which pretty much says to me it was in /guild.

I was a bit offended at first, but not now.  Now I'm just baffled.  I've
seen guild officers step in when two people are warring, when there's
harassment or when someone's just totally feeding incorrect information out
their butt, but this was just a bit on the surreal side.

How very odd.  He wasn't rude or anything, it was just...  Highly
unexpected?

The Bard and I finished on good terms as far as I could tell--maybe not best
friends, but with respect for each other.  He really was a spanking good
Bard, too.  The whole group kicked ass in fact, and while we didn't get our
primary goal we came darn close, got our secondary reward, had no deaths and
only one close call with a Lesser Succor, still took out 4 named, got three
augs, and got about 20% of a level each.

But I'm still sitting here with a o.O on my face over those tells...

Is it just that I've lived a sheltered life or something?  O.o

I think I need to change my laundry detergent.  I seem to have a
static-cling effect with Strangeness.
