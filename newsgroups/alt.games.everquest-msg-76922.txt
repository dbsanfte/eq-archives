Amazing how few people read past that line.

<snip rest>

Not too sure, but I would imagine that it's the same as any other stat
boost, that is, you can't increase it beyond the cap.  At your skill, I
would imagine that this item is rather useless, at least as far as the mana
goes.  Of course, if the rest to the stats are worth it, then just consider
the 5% med to be moot.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
