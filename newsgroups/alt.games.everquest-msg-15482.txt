Still not got a life yet, shit-for-brains?

In what way does wanting a key for the  AO beta test program (which is
for all of about 11 days before they are useless as AO is due to go
live then) constitute him being pirate scum? 

Does this opinion extend to your friend Bizbee, by the way? After all,
he frequented warez groups not so long ago... and a leopard doesn't
change its spots... so do you consider Bizbee to be pirate scum?
