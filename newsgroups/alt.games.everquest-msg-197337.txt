So far, when soloing, I use mez, rune, slow, haste, and root most of the 
time.  My pet takes care of killing mobs.  I have played around with 
charming too, and it is fun, but, I prefer doing that with a partner handy 
that can keep one of the mobs occupied for a bit when charm breaks.  Been 
having a blast in Paludal killing the fiends for the most part, just moved 
on to Shriknar.  I have never used KEI on my enchanter, except for last 
time, when I needed to enchant a few stacks of clay.
