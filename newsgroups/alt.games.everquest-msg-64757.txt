I have a small prog called "GameLauncher" running in the background. I can
add certain programms to it and it checks every minute or so if any of those
programs are running. If so, it will increase the priority for that program
to something you set in GameLauncher (High for all my games).

I first installed it on advice of an UT site to increase fps, but I've
noticed it works with lots of programs, including EQ.
It notably increases the speed.
