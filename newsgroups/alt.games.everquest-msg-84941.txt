I have to admit I was pretty excited by the Legends concept when I first 
got the news, and I was almost ready to sign in, but then I 
re-considered... On the one hand, although $40 a month doesn't sound too 
scary, nearly $500 a year does, for what the service actually provides. 
I'm subscribed to Allakhazam's, and I find that their character tracking 
service is more than adequate, and some tools, like the equipment 
upgrader, are absolutely invaluable, and while having the EQ servers 
update your character automatically is very nice indeed, the price seems 
a bit steep. Of course, all this leaving aside the fact that my life 
could probably use a little less EQ, rather than more. =)

But what really worries me is the quality of the population in the 
Legends servers... On the one hand, there have been no promises regarding 
the GMs enforcing things like naming conventions more strictly than on 
regular servers (I seriously doubt they will, since these servers don't 
really appear to be about roleplaying in the way Firiona Vie is), but 
also the fact that people may get a throughly inflated idea of what their 
money entitles them to, and are going to be very vocal about it, and very 
ready to bitch if they didn't get any PhAt L3wtZ in the week's GM event.

I have the feeling that, before long, every high level player in a 
Legends server is going to be running around with their own Artifact, and 
mudflation will make a server like Fennin Ro look impoverished by 
comparison.
