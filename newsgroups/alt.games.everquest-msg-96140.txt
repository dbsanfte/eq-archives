If you're ever cooking for somebody's little monsters, try the
following:

300 gm liver (beef or calf, your choice)
Snow Peas
Water Chestnuts
Baby Corn
Carrots
Whatever else you like in stir-fry

Take the piece of liver and slice it lengthwise into strips about 2 to
3 inches wide.  Then take the strips and thin-slice them into lots of
1/4 inch by 3 inch pieces.  Drop them all into a bowl while you're
preparing everything else.  When the little darlings ask what you're
preparing, show them the bowl and say it's fresh leeches for the
stir-fry.

(Yes, I do make liver stir-fry.  It's quite good.)
