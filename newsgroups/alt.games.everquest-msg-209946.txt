    No kidding, but if its a choice between that, or watching my group wipe,
I'll take a RD ;)

    Luckily I rarely have to do it...

    I would love for this to happen, it IS more of the norm but what *tends*
to happen goes something on the lines of:

Kuloth: I have selected a Ferocious Planar Mob for destruction by our group!
Kuloth: damn, 2 inc!
Chanter: Attempting to Mezz: a Ferocious Planar Add
A Ferocious Planar Add has belted your Chanter for 350!
A Ferocious Planar Add has belted your Chanter for 350!
A Ferocious Planar Add has belted your Chanter for 350!
Cleric: Casting desperado rapida heal on Chanter
A Ferocious Planar Add has belted your Chanter for 350!
A Ferocious Planar Add has belted your Chanter for 350!
A Ferocious Planar Add has belted your Chanter for 350!
A Ferocious Planar Add has belted your Chanter for 350!
Your chanter is yoghurt.
A Ferocious Planar Add has belted your Cleric for 350!

etc.

    Other stages of the game elemental crowd control seems to work, of the
groups I've had in the planes, some have been able to pull it off with
regular monotony, but most, when asked, will request that I take as long as
is required to make a pull to ensure that it's a single - and most indeed
seem incapable of reliably handling ferocious planar adds without at least
one death. I think it's possible you and I are thinking about different
sorts of groups... I don't want to comment on peoples crowd control
abilities, I haven't played a root or mezz capable class higher than 26 at
this point so it would be presumtuous of me.

    That's cool, but from what I can tell, the average player I group with
(ie outside an established raiding guild) doesn't quite have that equipment
level... I see a bit of a division in mid 50's players between those who are
mains who are not in a strong raiding guild, and the alts and mains in
strong raiding guilds. I can understand that the second category might find
these issues irrelevant.

    Well then, something like 100% of the groups I've gained my past 4
levels from have been a lame waste of time, because every single one I can
recall had at least one person who pissed off after 10 minutes of play. One
of these groups got me all the way through 54 in 11 hours straight. Not
exactly a powerlevel but pleasantly quick as far as I'm concerned for mid
50's, and certainly not a group I would want to leave at any point,
considering the death toll was low and the kills were nice and steady.

    From what I've seen, the overwhelming majority of groups can be made
viable if they have a slower, a healer, a tank and someone who can pull,
especially someone who can single pull reliably. I think people are too
quick to say "this is lame, im leaving" when a small change of tactics or
procedure would make the group a real exp spinner - or just a little
patience. I see this as more of a negative reflection on the people leaving
than the people staying.

    I'm also having a bit of trouble seeing why people are often so patient
farming items or plat but so impatient and unwilling to work at getting an
exp group working. Just alien to my way of thinking, since I find farming to
be fuck-boring and grouping hard-fast-hitting mobs to be rather cool :)

    I wouldn't agree with their thoughts on that one... Not that I'm in the
habit of interrupting someone's train of thought to start an argument - but
the idea that 5 other people should wait for you to spend 10 minutes making
it out to wherever the group is, and another ten for you to decide that it's
not good enough and then another 20 looking for a replacement that could
have been spent looking for a replacement if you'd said "I'm a 10 minute
guy" up front... Is unnaceptable to me. If you're not prepared to give a
group more than 10 minutes chance, why waste our time by turning up?

    Agree with that, the groups I've been in that have REALLY worked...
well, you feel like re-arranging your life's schedule just to stick around a
little longer :)

    At present prices decking out my main in cultural would cost around say
80,000 plat, as a quick estimate.

    I can make 1300 plat on the best 3 hours I've ever spent in rathe
mountains, so that would be almost 5 weeks of soloing giant for 40 hours a
week.

    I'm sorry, but that qualifies overwhelmingly as "twink" in my books. I
freely accept that you may have another standard and dissagree, but that's
easily within my definition of twink. There is no way I would spend anywhere
near that much time farming plat in the future. I hope to god my entire time
spent farming plat/sellable items/quest items for the rest of my life comes
in under that figure - I simply do not have the patience to farm plat to
that degree, and probably a combination of lacking patience and lacking
ubersupport to camp/raid my way to that level of uberness.

    Mind you I might be able to make plat there faster now, haven't been
able to force myself to STAY there 3 hours in the last 4 levels :o)... the
inevitable 5% jerk factor..... the utter lack of experience or
challenge..... it just lacks... appeal.

    Yeah, have noticed how very gear oriented SK's are :( Perhaps not the
best choice for a main if you want an easy game, but I guess I never wanted
an easy game.

    On the other hand, some struggles are fun, others are not... I think the
challenges in a computer game should be fun - or at least interesting -
especially one where the designers want people to keep on playing :)

[big snip of expansion discussion because I don't have a reply to most of it
:)]

    I think I would rather they enticed us to buy expansions with
*interesting content* rather than features that trivialise our past efforts.
I think they may've missed the boat with LoY though because I have yet to
hear or see a single thing about it which has made me want to even bother
installing it, let alone paying for it. The SK spells look useless, and
quest items..... well I guess I feel a bit burned about quests.

    I think you're right, if they'd made darkforge armour nodrop when the
bazaar came in, and added a series of quests that upgraded it... I'd have
felt *happy* about the time I had spent soloing those horrid lizards :)

    Perhaps not even upgraded it... handing it in for something else... yes
I know the SK epic falls in to that category, but it's been somewhat
superceded too. My pally friend picked up a 3k weapon that kicks its ass the
other day. If THAT isn't a tragic design flaw, I don't know what is.

    If you could hand in a full suit of nodrop darkforge armour in for a
single nodrop mosquito leg earring, I think that might have been worth it :)

James
