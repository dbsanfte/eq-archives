>Not an expert on this but firstly isn't the min specs for DAoC 256MB?

DAoC min is 128 MB if you have a PIII, 256 MB if you have a PII.
Recommended is 256 MB.

It's not clear what RAM effects on DAoC.  I've got two systems:

	900 MHz Athlon		1.2 GHz Athlon
	192 MB			256 MB DDR
	7200 RPM ATA 100 HD	5400 RPM ATA 66 HD
	GeForce 2 GTS		GeForce 2 MX400

Graphically, they look the same.  No noticable difference in
framerate.  However, the second system zones much faster.  Zoning into
the city in Midgard takes about 22 seconds on the first, 12 seconds on
the second.

I'll probably bump the first to 768 MB (3 slots, 256 MB max per slot)
for SoL, and the second to 512 MB (2 slots, max 1 GB per slot, but
anything past 256 MB per slot seems to get disproportionatly expensive
right now).  It will be interesting to see if that affects DAoC zoning
time.  I'll also try running DAoC from a RAM disk and see what that
does (Camelot directory is 313 MB right now, so on either system, once
I expand the RAM, there will be room for a RAM disk to hold all of
Camelot, still leaving as much RAM for the OS and the game as I have
now).
