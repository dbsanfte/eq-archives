Gosh, I think I was 34 before I did it solo and it was really tough and not
worth the effort!  At 39 you can do the ones in the Rathe Mountains solo w/o
to much trouble and make a lot of plat to!  The ones in NK may be easier but
I am not sure since I spent a lot of time in High Keep and did not hunt NK
much.
