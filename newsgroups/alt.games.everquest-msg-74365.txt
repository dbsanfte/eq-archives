Not five minutes. Thirty minutes for a pre-level 6 corpse with anything
on it, IIRC.  And I believe that's 30 minutes of online time, with
considerably more offline. So if you spent less than a half hour looking
for it and logged off, it's possible you might not have used up your
corpse timer so it was still there when you logged on. Also, if it slid
into a wall, it may have popped to the "safe spot" in the zone, as per a
recent patch change.

Then again, it could just be another inexplicable glitch in VI's
programming and it would have stayed there for years.
