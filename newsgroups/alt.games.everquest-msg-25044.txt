So what do people think of GM events? I hate to be a killjoy, but I
just can't see the point. 

Don't get me wrong.... in principle, I'm all for it. The problem is,
these are, by nature, roleplaying experiences, and I just can't see EQ
as a roleplaying game.

To roleplay, you need a degree of submersiveness. How can you achieve
that with a bunch of idiots hanging around making dicks of themselves?
Also, what's the point of roleplaying in a static environment where
hardly anything changes? It's like Groundhog Day... wake up, kill
things, go to sleep, wake up, kill the SAME things, etc. 

Flame away ;)
