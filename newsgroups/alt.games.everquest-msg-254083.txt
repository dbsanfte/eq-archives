I've shown a bunch of the posted screenshots (EQLive and other places)
to a friend at work and they're almost all too dark.  I bring them in
and tweak them so he (and I) can actually see what's in them.  Seems
to apply to everybody.  Judging by that, I'd say there probably isn't.

So, just go over them afterwards with MS Photo or IrFanView or
something like that, tweak 'em to where they're clear, and save them.
