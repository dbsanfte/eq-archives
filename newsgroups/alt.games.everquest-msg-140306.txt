Your statement was that I had said I had never posed under another name. There
was no statement like that there. 
You were attacking someone else claiming they were me,  I told you that it
wasn't them that had made earlier statements concerning you. The sad fact is
you never apologized to the person for smearing their name, you didn't give a
shit that you had blamed someone for something they had no knowledge of, sort
of like what you like to call a terrorist type person.
