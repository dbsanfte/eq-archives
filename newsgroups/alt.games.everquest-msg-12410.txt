Hi all

I never found a use for this until i my Guild held a duelling event at the
Lake Rathe Arena, you could hear the screams of anguish from the wizard in
Freeport :). Along with ALENIA's DISENCHANTING MELODY which you get at level
22 it makes a potent force for duelling casters. Use Melanie's to 'gate'
away and then Alenia's to remove DoT's, etc. The only problem I found with
duelling my Bard is that although I was very difficult to kill, it took for
ever to kill hybrids/tanks, so the fights were VERY long!! Hopefully the
DoT's I have picked up in the 30's will help :).

Take Care

Karalin the Suicidal Bard
P.S. another good trick is to charm a casters pet, you get a message saying
you cannot charm it, but the pet suicides when the charm would have run out.
This especially annoys Mages who spend AGES recasting til they get a good
pet :)
