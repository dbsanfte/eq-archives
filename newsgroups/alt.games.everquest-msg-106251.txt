  Too bad... the new UI was probably the feature I was most looking forward
to with the Luclin release.  I'd hoped by the time I built myself a system
capable of running Luclin smoothly that they'd have worked all the kinks out
and implemented the UI or at least the bazaar, but it looks like we've still
got several months to go before we see either.

  Though I'm not happy about the delay, I'm glad that they seem to be trying
to produce a QUALITY UI, something the game has been screaming for since
release.  No other game I know of created in the past 4 years requires a
player to type in a line command with like seven numeric parameters to make
a change in the client (like the /hitsmode command).  I hope whatever they
come up with is modern, easy to use, flexible and doesn't require .ini file
edits and complicated line commands to make simple changes... and most
importantly, I hope it's stable.  As much as I hate the current client, I'd
rather wait a year for the new one and have it work relatively well, than
get it in 6 months and suffer through intermittent crashes, freezes,
inordinately bad frame rates and improperly functioning elements for 2-3
months.
