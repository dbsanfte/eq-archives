To say that I  "did not _ever_ have to die" is an exaggeration.  Yes, there
where ways to TRY to avoid death when in a foot race and they often did
work.  Not always and they where not a guarantee of escape.

My point is still valid; I can escape death WITHOUT trying anything fancy,
whether strafe-running or jumping.  The removal of this challenge was the
thrust of my statement.

And, if that is the only one of my points you can argue with, then I must be
able to "do far better than that".
