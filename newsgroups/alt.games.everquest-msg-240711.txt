   Um.  You got the first part right.  But using emotes can be abused.  You
don't really want to be known as "that guy that emotes like crazy all the time",
do you?  Just use the emotes when the situation calls for them.

   The second.  And you do by saying words that your character might say.  Think
of yourself as being an actor in some vast, unscripted play.  It's not hard,
really.  If you meet someone you might like to group with, try saying something
like "Would you care to join with me to slay the enemies this evening?" rather
than "Hey dude wanna team up and whack shit?"  Also, on FV the convention is
that stuff in (( is ooc.  For example, you might see ((Oh crap!  My cat fell in
the hot tub again!)) if you were grouped with me.  This just means I am speaking
this as Annie, not Teapray.

    The roleplay on FV as waned alot since the server was born, but it is still
alive and well.  It is fairly common to come across someone that won't group
with someone else for RP reasons.  You might see shouts like "Paladin of 43
season, seeks employment.  No evils need respond!"  I've had dark elves who
refused healing and rezzes from Teapray because she is a "Lightbringers".   And
of course, there are the lowbrows who mock others for roleplaying.  They are
total dumbasses, as you might imagine.

   You asked about the /role command on FV.  When the server was first was
created, everyone had /role thrust upon them, and there was no way to turn it
off.  Everyone had a purple name, which means that when you typed someone's name
in the who command, you wouldn't see their class or zone they were in.  Then
Sony changed it, and we could take /role off, turning our names blue.  Most
people do still keep it on, but some of us don't.  I don't for example, for
roleplaying reasons oddly enough.  Teapray doesn't think it's appropriate to
hide what she is or where she is from the eyes of her god.  Yeah, I know that
pretty murky roleplaying there.  But it works for me.

   So what is your FV character's name?
