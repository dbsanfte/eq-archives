Well, your children did show knowledge before hand.  If a kid of any age
came up to me and wanted to discuss enthalpy and Pascal's law, I'm pretty
much going to assume she knows enough to understand more.  It's kinda like,
if you have your towel, people will assume you're prepared enough to also
have other things like soap and a toothbrush, and will be willing to loan
them to you if you don't.  I'll stop now before I somehow work the Ravenous
Bugblatter beast of Trall into a botany or thermodynamics discussion.
