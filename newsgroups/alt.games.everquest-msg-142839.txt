I am just so in love with the fact that a simple 'new' spell available on
test turns into a grouping argument about shaman and druids. Not that it's
usual for a thread to get off subject /snicker.

Suffice it to say, as a backup to the inevitability of more than a few
clerics being present at just about any raid, any spell that allows a druid
or shaman to psuedo c-heal (if I am gathering the use of the spell
correctly) is a major plus to both classes, that said lemme join in the
argument a bit:

Ever see a druid get aggroed in-group or on a raid? How about a shaman?
Seems to me that one of them tends to run around trying to peel the mob off
onto someone else, and one can actually stand and fight back long enough for
the ma or group tank to come get em back. For the sake of argument, and
because I just love starting problems, I will leave it to you to decide
which is which.

I only replied to this because your 'discussion' got a little too tit for
tat... and I love it when a thread offers a good bit to think about. Those
one line answers and rebuttals are of little use to me.
