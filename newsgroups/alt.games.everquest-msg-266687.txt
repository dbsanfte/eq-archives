   I broke down (as pretty much expected) and got EQ2.  I still like CoH,
but I've looked forward to trying EQ2 since I heard it was coming out. 
With luck I'll get a chance to play with some other agers again!

   Of course, it would be easier if I knew who was playing whom and where. 
So, if you are playing EQ2, please speak up and list you character's name,
race, occupation, and server.  Unless you don't want to, of course, I'm not
some crazy stalker bitch that really cares that much.

   Me:

Tealeaf: Ogre Priest on AB.  Thinking of starting a good character as well,
not decided what or where though.
