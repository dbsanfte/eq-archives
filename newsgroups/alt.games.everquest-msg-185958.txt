Divine Aura (DA) is a level 1 cleric spell, hardly restricted to
higher levels. Zoning to escape mobs that are after you is also
something that applies at low levels, too; I do it while hunting in
Qeynos Hills after I've gotten past level 3 in the newbie yard.

It also doesn't take being high level to understand these things, all
it takes is doing some research on the web (e.g. http://lucy.fnord.net
for spells, http://everquest.allakhazam.com for
equipment/quests/monsters, http://www.eqatlas.com for maps,
http://www.eqtraders.com for tradeskills). Of course reading all this
does take away some of the sense of accomplishment and wonder in the
low levels, so it's not necessarily something you want to do.

As for getting levels, I don't see what's so hard about it: find
group, kill monsters with group, earn experience. If in doubt about
where to find a group, go to the Plane of Knowledge and ask; someone
will be sure to have suggestions.
