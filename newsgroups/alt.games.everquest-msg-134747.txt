Personally, if something's stackable, I just shove it in the bank.  I 
spend a lot of time running between Freeport/Oasis/HHK anyway, so if I'm 
in Guild Chat, I'll sit down in EC and keep my eyes peeled.  I'm usually 
able to get 100 plat per stack for spider silks that way, and 
occasionally, I even find someone still willing to pay 50 plat per stack 
of spiderling silks.  Why do I wait to sell them that high?  Because if 
I don't sell em, then when I'm ready to tradeskill again, I'll use them 
myself.  Plus, of course, "because I can" :D

Ryou
(if it's *not* stackable, otoh...)
