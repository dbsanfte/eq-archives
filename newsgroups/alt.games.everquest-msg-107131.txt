I have *precisely* the same thing happen. A system that had been rock solid
became impressively unstable after the luclin graphics engine was patched in
(I don't own luclin). I updated drivers, tweaked bios, updated bios and set
video card to 2xAGP which seems to have reduced, but not eliminated, the
problem.

I don't think it's heat because i've never had a problem with it before and
the crash can occur almost immediately on a cold PC. Although it's not actually
a crash, it's a system lock. Everything freezes and Ctrl-Alt-Del is ignored.
