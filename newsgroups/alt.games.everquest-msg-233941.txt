There are ways to wipe out the macro buyers. Make them read the screen
and repeat a phrase. Display a character on the screen that is
graphical. One keystroke required by a human is all they need.

Another is 65th level lawyers, this has festered long enough. They
need to start sueing, and dont stop until Yantis or IGE cry like
little girls. Make it not worth the business. I wish there was a
better way, but, long term EQ is sufering.
