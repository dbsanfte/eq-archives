I wouldn't have 'wasted' that much mana per mob at 54.  DoTs
simply aren't an effective tool in cleric-based XP groups.
Druids get groups more for nukes, port/evac, and snare, for
instance.  And how many times do you see "/ooc group looking
for a necro" in dungeons?

No, 54 and 55 clerics will still need some boost to ensure group
viability.  Higher-level clerics (and their groups) will be taking
the higher-level mobs for the "extra" XP, so that's not much of
a reason, IMO.  And they can't add their melee damage at those
levels, so that's not it.

I'm not sure what the answer is, but I'm positive it's not a 250
mana per mob DoT.
