Well, AC is god, especially for rangers I know.  I didn't mean at the
expense of AC.

Does it effect your damage output with archery to the same extent at
STR does for melee?  ie, will I see the same increase in damage
(roughly) if I increased my strength from 100 to 125 as if I increased
my dexterity from 100 to 125?

And as for my prority list when it comes to gear, as of right now it
looks something like this:

1. AC

2. AC

3. Strength

4. Dexterity

5. Wisdom

That look about right?
