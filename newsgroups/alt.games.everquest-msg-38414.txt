Quoted Absor comment from EQ boards, on caster's realm:

Hmm I hope DAOC ends up enough better than EQ that I won't feel like
dropping the cash on Luclin, which would seem like supporting this
goofy design. 

I find it pretty irritating that when you have a perfectly good
character, you are more or less going to be FORCED to level up other
ones just to experience new content such as quests (and possibly loot
though that is not mentioned) I mean isn't it enough that I've gotten
to the mid 50's on one char without having to get some other char to
the high 20's to experience an add on that I bought for that mid 50's
char to have fun in?

The best way to take all player's desires into account is the old way
of letting them all do quests or get loot that they are able to do.

"Everquest" my ass, at least not on the same perfectly good character.


"You're correct that a high level character doesn't have the same
option. But what we're really talking about here, for the most part,
is what the player wants not what the character wants. 

A player with no high level characters that wants to experience high
level content just needs to gain experience on one of those characters
and he can see that content. 

A player with no mid level characters that wants to experience a
level-restricted quest just needs to gain experience on a low level
character and he can see that content. 

Yes, there are most certainly going to be some cases where it is the
character's desire to complete a quest that he can't access due to his
greater experience. But that is very different than a player that
claims that they are being unfairly restricted from that content. 

The inclusion of Trivial Loot Code for Shadows of Luclin does indeed
sacrifice the desires of a few high level characters. In exchange we
gain a greater ability for appropriately leveled characters to access
that same content. But in no case is one player given less of a chance
to access any content than any other player. 

It's not that we are unaware of the desires of the players. We are
very aware of those desires. But there are a lot of players, with
characters of all levels. And all of those players need to be taken
into account as much as possible. 

All quests implemented for Shadows of Luclin will be designed with the
Trivial Loot Code in mind.
