The trouble with the argument that you cant distinguish when they pull the
plug is this...
Almost all of my deaths from LD have been soloing with sow/jboots against
normal speed mobs. Why would I pull the plug and risk death when I can just
run away? Ditto, why would I be lying dead at the bottom of the gorge in EK
at level 20+ with sow? Why would my chanter be lying dead in neriak in high
elf form? oh yes of course... I forgot to shape change lol.
Of course all this involves gm's time, and money for Verant, and in turn
guess money from us. Rightly or wrongly, theres your real reason.
