I was in Lavastorm today, and I noticed something strange on track.
There was a blank space between two other mobs on track, so I tried
tracking it.  It worked, and it led me to a small lava pool in the
corner of the zone.  I put on my fire resist and dove under the lava
to check it out.  The mob was invisible, and didn't show up when I
tried using see invis.  I was able to target it though, and it conned
indifferent red to me.  It had no name at all, not even a punctuation
mark like that ! fellow.  I managed to attack it, but I got stunned
and the mob and lava eventually killed me.  I went back to try to get
it out of the lava, and this time I managed to pull it out of the
lava.  I tried snaring and combusting it, but it resisted everything.
I finally gave up and left.  The most it hit me for was 130, so it's
pretty tough.  When it would hit me it would also say "Pain and
suffering hits YOU blah blah..." but this was even when I was outside
the lava, so it wasn't the generic non-melee damage message.

Anyone have a clue what the hell this thing is?
