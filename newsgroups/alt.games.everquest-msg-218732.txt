Nope, different.  Huta's right, time it. :)

}I have a timer that sounds ever 44 minutes totell me to force feed.  

Hm, that's a clever use for a timer, good job.

A couple minor corrections:

}You can get your skill

}bear/cat/wolf filete's.. Everytime one of those creatures drops a meat,
}rather then sell it try to make a filete, then sell it.

You need a 'filleting knife', not a skinning knife.  Skinning knife is for 
tailoring, for making HQ/MQ pelts into MQ/LQ pelts, and for fishing, for 
making fish scales and fish eggs.

As a side note, if you don't want to hunt the meats, the gnome near the 
spires in Shadowhaven sells bear/lion meat in unlimited quantities for 
roughly 1gp each.  I just spent the last two days getting about 20 of my 
alts to 143 baking this way.  At 255 wis/int it took roughly 3.5 ten-slot 
backpacks full of meat to go from 0 to 143.  At 87 wis/int, it took 
approximately 10.  *wrist twitches in pain* Stupid monk... Next time I'm 
breaking out the extra wis gear. :) It seemed as if materials 
consumed/time spent decreased a lot more between 87 and 130 than between 
130 and 255.  I had a suprising number of twinks with int/wis in the area 
of 130 after a mind buff. :) But it generally took 5-6 backpacks full for 
characters in the 125-135 range.

For my next trick, all alts to 122 brewing with the fishing grub/flask of 
water technique!

}once it says you can
}no longere gain any skill, switch to fish rolls. Now you have a cheap(free
}if you fish at all) sorce of food

Don't expect more skill though.  Fish rolls triv at 135, as opposed to 143 
for filleting.  If you want further skill, I recommend patty melts.  
The only inconvenient parts are the non-stick frying pan, which is 
reusable like the knife, and getting the cheese from jaggedpine.  Patty 
melts are also more than a 'meal', as I recall.

Fishing isn't quite free, btw.  Gotta get bait from somewhere.  That's a 
3 copper quibble though. :) Unless you're making your own bait from 
gunthak mackerel in ocean of tears.  Maybe. :)
