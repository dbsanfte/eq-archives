My guess is that Ben meant this to be an "if the shoe fits, wear it" type 
of reference. I'm not a raiding player, yet, and may never be. However, I 
certainly see his point and agree with it for the most part. Though I do 
enjoy some of these "bones for the casual gamer", many I do see as bad 
ideas that have done more to candy-coat and, dare I say, cheapen EQ than 
contribute to its depth and value, IMO.
