Well, obviously you give a shit, so my question is answered.  However,
I very much doubt you're playing a 30 druid atm - I, however, play my
alt with a 30 druid as our main healer when we don't do a PL party.

Sol A

29 (then 30) druid
28 (then 29) rogue
27 (then 28) bard (me)
29 (then 30) mage
26 (27 and 28) wizard
25 (then 26) necro

Everyone made a full level in less than 3 hours - not PL'ing, just pulling
and having a blast.  The druid kept up just fine with heals.  So, to 
answer your question less belligerently - They do just fine at 30, thank
you.  So, experience tells me they do just fine at 30 and at the high end.
