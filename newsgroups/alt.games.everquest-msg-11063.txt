Ah, yes, the old "semi-automatic guns" boogie-man.  The anti-gun
propaganda machine has done a real nice job demonizing them,
but there's not a damned thing you can do with a "semi-automatic"
firearm that you can't do equally well with a revolver, a pump
shotgun, a lever-action rifle, or even a bolt-action rifle.
In fact, several times the annual speed-shooting championship
has been won by a guy with a revolver, over all the other
competitors using semi-automatic pistols.

Or are you under the bone-headed impression that "semi-automatic"
is synonymous with "machine gun"?  Lord knows CNN *STILL*
hasn't managed to figure out that they're not.

Before one can have a valid opinion about firearm policy,
it helps to actually know something about the subject.
Hint:  Journalists and TV dramas are crappy sources
of actual information on firearms.  In fact, I am
constantly appalled at the volumes of misinformation
about firearms and gun owners that are presented as
"fact" by journalists -- it's usually done with all the
sophistication of an Amish farmer covering the Indy 500
(for our non-American friends, I'll point out that the
Amish are a sect who eschew technology and among other
things still drive only horse-drawn buggies).

Good, then the feeling is mutual.

Legal in many areas, minor crimes (misdemeanors) in others.
It varies from place to place.  I never claimed we
were consistent.
