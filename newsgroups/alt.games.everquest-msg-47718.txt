Ah wow, 

"Players will have the option of toggling between the normal
experience pool to gain levels, and the alternative enhancement pool
to gain enhancements whenever they wish (although this may require you
to zone after you have toggled your switch). Switching between the two
pools will not cause you to lose experience. Experience loss due to
death suffered by the character will be taken from the "Leveling"
experience pool, but it will not impact your alternative advancement
pool. "

Like that part. So its not even 60 like I originally thought but 51
plus you can toggle to get the xp into that enhancement pool or into
leveling. Being stuck in 55 and often getting some xp but then dying 9
times on a raid and losing some even with a 56 percent rez each time,
i might often do that.

Yeah, except there is no comparison. It only shows shots of what I
guess is the new look, not side by side shots. The textures look kind
of richer I guess but since they are in areas I'm so familar with I
would not even notice the difference, oh wait i just noticed the
"click here to see the old textures" ah, ok it basically is sharper
textures and better lighting at a distance I guess? Oh and the ground
is more of a detailed texture outside.
