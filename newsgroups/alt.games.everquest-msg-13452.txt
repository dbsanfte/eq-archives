    Stupid looking route, but he still gets to you in reasonable time: not
an issue.

    The GM won't show up 20 seconds later - he'll wait and watch you. If you
continue to use the backing-up trick to avoid / minimize damage to yourself,
he'll pop in and hit you with an official warning. If you have a history of
doing this, he'll lay down the suspension. Basically, MOST GMs won't nail
you when you first discover something. If you continue to do it, though,
they'll take action.

    No.

    No.

again until

    No.

    Very close. You can't pull to this specific spot AND use the backing-up
trick.

    Yup, you got it. ;-)

    I, as GM/guide, would tell you that if you find that you cannot pull to
that location and fight in your normal manner without causing the mob to
path in a manner that is easy to exploit then you should not pull to that
area, and send in a /bug report detailing what happened. I would furthermore
tell you that if you were found in that area again after our little
discussion, doing the exact same thing, that I would nail you for
exploiting.

    As for why it's an exploit? "You have found an area where the poor
pathing of the mobs creates opportunity for you to engage in combat with
little to none of the usual risks associated with that method of combat. If
you continue to pull here and use that pathing to your advantage, it meets
the criteria under the rules of play of an exploit."

    But I'm not a guide - you have to be a member of a big guild who wants
to scout unfamiliar territory to be a guide. :-/ If I've missed the point -
if you want to know why Verant punishes players rather than fix pathing -
that I cannot answer.

    James
