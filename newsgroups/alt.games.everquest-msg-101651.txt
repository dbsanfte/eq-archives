 They really need to update that info...

 I recommend rerolling and putting most of your starting points into
Stamina. Stamina = Hit Points. In addition to that if it's over 100 you
don't suffer a penalty when your yellow bar runs out except for the
ability to jump. You may want to put 5 into DEX or AGI but I don't
remember the starting amount.

 My resume - 60 Iksar monk who maxxed out STR much earlier than STA.
