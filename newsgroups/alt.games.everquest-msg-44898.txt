Hate isn't that bad, generally, and in my mind is a much easier
break-in than fear.  We generally do the intial break-in with 2
groups, mainly so we can get moving quickly.  All the maps I've seen
show the break-in camp in the southwest corner, but I've always just
pulled mobs to the zone-in building.  Either way, be prepared for a
lot of mobs at once, assist and don't get aggro unless you're supposed
to.  If you fight in the zone-in building, stay near the top of the
room, away from the opening, and expect damn rats to aggro on medding
casters.  
You will move a time or two here, so pay attention and keep sow up if
possible.  If the order comes to move, repeat it in group as you move
out,  but move quickly and stay together.  Do NOT fight on the walls,
as this will aggro 2nd floor mobs which will show their displeasure by
deathtouching you.  That goes double if you have a bard in your group.
Do NOT fight on the walls.  Don't confuse mobs with other characters,
they look a lot more alike than you're used to.  
Don't sweat about resists, nothing on the first floor really casts
that much, AC and aggo control will help more.  You might bring some
MR stuff, but AC is king.  When you die, get ready to get rezzed back
quickly, things move fast, especially if the raid is planning on going
to the 2nd floor.   
If Tiru is going with you, there's a good chance she will get an armor
piece or two.  Check up on what you guys need for you epics from
there, Don't want to let a piece rot and then find out it's the one
piece you can't seem to get.  Have your guild rep discuss loot and
such with the leaders, both before the raid and before telling anyone
to loot.  Have fun, and if you ever see the yellow 'you have gained
experience' line, you're doing something wrong,  :)
