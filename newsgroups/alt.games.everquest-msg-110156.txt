Problem is, I'd have to run back across DL, un-sown, un-levitated.  That's a
process that involves picking my way carefully around mobs that would love
to flatten me (even up on the zone wall).  I can, and usualy do proceed that
way, but it's not the most conducive to fleeing from a mob.  If I tried
that, I would likely be reduced to a fine red pally-smear in the DL
landscape, before I even made it to KC.  If I'm going to die, I'd rather die
fighting, in a place where I know exactly where I fell.  Easier to find the
corpse.

Some places don't have a very good exit strategy.  Also, you say I should do
so within the limits of the class I'm playing.  Ok, so I'm a paladin with a
ghoulbane, buffed, with Instument of Nife up (which didn't proc a single
time).  I'm fighting a blue undead mob.  By all indications, this should
have been an easy fight, both class and level-wise, but instead, it was a
massacre.  This is the type of thing I think is wrong.  Tough fight vs. Easy
fight, or Brutally beaten vs. Tough fight, I can see, but to go from Easy
fight to Insane slaughter... that's a bit much.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
