Which Stat is most importent for a monk. (not resists, hp or ac) i mean Str
Stam Agi dex ETC>
before i made the monk i asked 4 level 60 monks what stat should i put my
starting points into
3 said Stam
1 said half stam half str
i went with all stam. i rarely use fists. just enough to keep them maxed. i
mainly use duel 1hb. and 2hb to keep it maxed.
i recently took on 12 blue sarnaks not stop with a level 60 cleric PLing me.
and my stam went down to 1 yellow left. but i think thats pretty good
considering they were 12 in a row no rest (bloody adds and someone traind 4
on me)
so back to my point.
