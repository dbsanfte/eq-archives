  Short answer: no.

  Mobs that are programmed to attack other mobs will attack those mobs when they
come in to range regardless of whether or not that mob is engaged with a player
character.  Mobs that aren't programmed to attack other mobs won't do so, even
if they like you.  So, basically, mobs don't care if you're being attacked when
they 'make the decision' on attacking another mob or not.

  Kidzean Gix doesn't attack NPCs to my knowledge, but I think Dragoon Zytl
might.
