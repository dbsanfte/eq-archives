Take that with a grain of salt.

I haven't had EQ "just crash on me" in several years. 

I've had issues where it would crash when i was using an out of date UI.

I've had had issues where it would crash when alt-tabbing between full 
screen and windowed mode (occasionally).

But neither were serious problems.

I've had issues of getting stuck in geometry, falling for 20000 damage, 
and so forth. None of those are crashes though, and all of them can be 
worked around.

No game in continuous development is going to ever be perfect.
