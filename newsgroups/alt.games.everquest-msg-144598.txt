Would this be the infamous Invasion that they felt they need to spam
the servers in the early mornings about three to four time an hour?


As for the n00ber question. I went Origins convention (second biggest
gaming convention after Gencon) with a roommate. We were sitting in on
a GURPs seminar with none other then Steve Jackson himself. Most the
questions were reasonable but of course there is always that one guy
who makes you cringe about being a roleplayer. I turned to my roommate
after the n00bs silly ass question and just said, "Gee wonder why the
world thinks RPGers are retards?"

Sadly RPGing, even electronic ones, have their share of the socially
retarded participants. It's why they excel at EQ, it's about all that
is going on in their RL.
