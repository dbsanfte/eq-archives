KEI and POTG aren't cheap to buy for everyone with enchanters who
charge 100p+ per shot for KEI. POTG is oddly hard to get (For a druid
that's too low level to cast it, that is). Horses are damn expensive
and don't actually speed meditation, so they're irrelevant...

Anyway, if we're talking buff compliments, hand the ranger Speed of
Shissar, Chloro or better, and a nifty high level cleric HP/AC buff
and who needs arrows?

Another thing: Arrows don't fizzle. Arrows don't interrupt. Arrows can
be fired *WHILE RUNNING*.

In the end they balance out with DDs... So, why not make them have the
same penalty as DDs?
