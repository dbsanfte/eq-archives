Ah, but you CAN put /stopcast in a hotkey!  So that suggests that
what you really want is a hotkey for:
	/dismount
	/stopcasting
You might need a "/pause 1" or something to make sure the dismount
has time to work before the /stopcast.

Amusingly, I knew about /stopcasting (which can actually be assigned
directly to a key via the Options window without making it a "social"
button) and I have shift-S mapped to it, because ducking to stop a
cast can have other undesirable effects such as turning off attack.
But I didn't know about the /dismount command until it came up in
guild chat just a few nights ago, so I was missing that element.  Now
that I know about it, I'll try setting up that hotkey!
