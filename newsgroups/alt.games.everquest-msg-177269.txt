Er, yes, but a) how does a low level contemplate getting there, and b) if
they are not a caster class how do they bind there (and I thought it as a
non bind point for anyone at least for a while)...oh and c) its still tied
to an expansion.

If Feydedar is up you are dogmeat even at mid level....the thing about PoK
is that any lvl 1 character or higher can essentially use it as an
entirely solo effort ready transit system - the pots need help getting
there, help establishing yourself there if you can at all and also need
Ruins of Kunark....Gfay to Odus is now a matter of 2 minutes for a
lvl 1 ranger rather than a way off and needing some thought or at least
starting in SFG rather than Kelethin.
