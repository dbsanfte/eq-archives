It's actually pretty amazing the number of places that still have laws
regarding this.  Here in Colorado, liquor stores cannot be open on Sundays.
I'm sure that throughout the bible belt you can find a lot of places that
still have major restrictions regarding at least certain types of businesses
on Sundays.

Not that I feel that this commandment, or the rest of them should be
displayed in a courtroom.
