Maybe it's a server thing.   On E'ci, it's standard practice.    Sebilis is
the place where it really matters though.   Due to the high number of trash
gem drops, clerics make out above and beyond symbol costs, usually.

Aside from that, you might want to consider whether or not your group actually
needs symbol?     Until I got to KC and Seb, I had never once asked for that
buff, and had several times specificly asked them not to do it. (not counting
raids)   As it was an extra expense to them for which we were gaining no real
benefit.  If your party is coming that close to death fighting in dreadlands
in any kind of an appropriate leveled group... you've got to be doing
something wrong.

Dungeons kill.   Dreadlands is a safe, boring experience pharm.
