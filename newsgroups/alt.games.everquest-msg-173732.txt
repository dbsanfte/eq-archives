I am going to defend Best Buy and...yes, folks....I'm going to defend
Wal-Mart, too.

Both have excellent prices and often give serious competition to
Electronic Boutique and Babbages.  Heck, Best Buy is one of the few
places where I'll buy something, and then find out at the register
that it's a couple bucks cheaper than it was marked as.

But I'm going to give some props to Wal-Mart for a moment.  I've been
to Wal-Marts in Massachusetts, Maryland, and Virginia.  You know what?
Each one had a $9.99 copy of Planescape:Torment.  Each one had the
$9.99 Fallout 1 & 2 compilation.  For a store that is designed to
appeal to conservative middle-America, that is a good selection and a
good price.  Both Wal-Mart and Best Buy have PC games the DAY they
come out...which is more than you can say about Toys R Us and those
Comp-USA Express places.  

I'm not going to defend the business practices of these stores, or the
way they have revelled in their mediocrity in some other areas.  But
in terms of software selection and price, both these places are quite
good.
