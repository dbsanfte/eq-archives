What I did with my warrior when leveling him was to have the kick or
bash hotkey down at 9 or 0 where I dont use hotkey numbers anyway so I
could see when it ungreyed. Meanwhile my kick hotkey was in slot 2 and
had sense heading and whatever else I was practicing on it. I did the
same with my rogue, where backstab was at the bottom as a visual
indicator and the backstab hotkey did sense heading, detect traps,
pickpocket and whatever other skill needed raising.

I never got used having that same key on every page, seemed like too
much of a waste so I went with what worked for me,

Some things are nice to have a visual indication of, others I find I can
do without quite easily. Never put the melee attack key on the hotkey
bar for instance, didn't see the need.
