I think he is hoping that someone from EQ2 management will
see his post and then call an emergency meeting at Sony.

"Gentlemen, we need to drop our price to $12.95/month, otherwise
Chuck won't play."

I get a real kick out of the 12 year who post complaints on the WoW forum
about the monthly cost.

Hell, I'll happily pay $15/month to keep the kids out.

Does anyone have an age restricted server? Something like "must be at
least 25 to join."
