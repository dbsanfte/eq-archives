Er... since you're saying how hard it is to solo your wizard against red
cons in dungeon environments, I assume you're making the same comparision
with the warrior.  Otherwise you're being deliberately misleading.

And if you can solo red cons nonstop with your fungi twinked warrior, which
server?   I'd like to come watch.

And just out of curiosity, even if you can, why would you try to solo your
wizard on reds in dungeons?    I can't imagine that would be "good"
experience even with KEI reducing downtime, compared to kiting or quad
kiting or simple root nuking mobs out in the open.
