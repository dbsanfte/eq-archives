Bah.  Bizbee's got a bug in his craw about looking for cheap
excuses for disagreeing with *me* -- I've never had a problem
with agreeing with him, or anyone else whenever they make sense,
nor giving credit where it's due.

Even in the middle of some of my flames of him I've pointed out
that he has improved in a lot of ways.  Too bad he's been backsliding
recently, he was really doing well for a while.

I don't hold childish grudges.  I'm not about to start just
because other people can't control theirs.
