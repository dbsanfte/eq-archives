I've done my (admitedly short) EQ career avoiding the "popular" zones on
purpose. Died in Crushbone once then bailed out to see Antonica. Went to
Oasis once to sell Greater Light Stones, ran through LoIO once to get to FM
just to check it out. Spent some time in the Karana's but hated it. Never
camped the Hermit or the Ancient Croc and probably won't camp the Ancient
Cyclops either. Let the doodz, KS'ers, trainers, beggars and other rif-raf
congreate with each other in the popular zones. I prefer the road less
traveled.
