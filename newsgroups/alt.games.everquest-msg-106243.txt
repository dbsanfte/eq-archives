I'm just curious. Which dirction do you think wizards are "unbalanced"
in? If you think they are broken, many will agree with you, though some
recent changes have made them somewhat more appealing. Still one VERY
tough class to play, though, until you reach the very high levels. If
you are saying they are overpowered, then "your mother was a hamster,
and your father smelled of elderberries. I fart in your general
dyyyyrection."

Wizards have been a fucked over class for a while. Giving them a near
impossible to attain uber AA skill that you can use,.. what? Once every
few HOURS, is far from unbalancing. Good to see wizards getting more
desirable again. Not that they haven't been desired in end game groups
and raids, but getting there is a royal bitch, and the addition of
critical blasts and such have been nice tuning moves to make them a bit
more playable in the low levels.

Don't be rediculous. You *have* to have Pallies. If you raid Yael, who
do you get to take the DT if there's no bards or rangers around?
