My Beastlord is only 24th but here is my opinion:

Easiest class to solo to 24th that I have played and I have played
most classes (except ranger, druid or paladin) to 24th.

Tank.  You get 2 tanks for the price of one group slot as pet is
powerful.  One group I was recently in was 3 beastlords, shaman and
cleric.  We rocked, took on multiple mobs with no problem as pets
could handle adds easily.

> 3. Are they fun?

If you like Melee class play they are pretty good.  You can also sit
and play cleric to the pet if you want so there is some variety.

I play an Ogre beastlord. I put all but 5 points into Stamina. 
Beastlord is primarily a tank and Wis items are all over the place.

You summon the pet like Necros, etc.  Previously the pet stayed with
you but was incredibly weak and you had to use a spell to Buff it. 
This way works better IMHO.

I like Ogre's best (image of martial artist Ogre was too good to pass
up) but I don't think there is a bad race choice.  I'd bet Vah Shir
have the best Beastlord quests since they were introduced together. 
I'm not sure there are any Ogre beastlord quests...
