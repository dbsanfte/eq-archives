Hi,

try Everfrost for good money. The only thing is that you would not get too
much exp at your level anymore.

Hunt wooly mammuths, they should be lightblue to you now. They drop often 1
or even 2 tusks which go for about 9pp each. Easy money and not bad for the
level you can attain it. Just make sure you have a container with giant size
with you (eg sewingkit) so you can carry them =) They spawn near the
Icegiantfort (not dangerous at all) and can be spawned by killing the large
and giant spiders there :-)


Good luck and I hope I could help


Christian
