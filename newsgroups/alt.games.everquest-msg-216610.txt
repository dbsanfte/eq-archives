I've noticed that iron rations last considerably longer than muffins, 
and milkskins are one of the fastest consumed drink items. If your 
frugal with your pennies go for the cheap stuff at lowest levels, but at 
higher levels... where people routinely destroy copper, silver, and even 
gold I think you can afford the 'good stuff'.

For vendor bought I usually do water flasks, and iron rations.

(Or "whatever the local vendor has"... as its a good way of burning off 
some copper/silver if theres a food vendor in/near the hunting grounds, 
and then its free food... because I will readily destroy excess coinage.)
