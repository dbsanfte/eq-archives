No, you do not have to remove your lock.  IE can be set to prompt you for 
each and every time an activeX app wants to be installed.  Think of it 
more as installing a doorbell.  The app rings the doorbell, you decide 
whether or not to unlock your door, for each and every app.  When you get 
tired of hearing it ring, you remove the doorbell.
