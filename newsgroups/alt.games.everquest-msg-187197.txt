I play on Sullon Zek.  I know for a fact I've lost exp from a DoT, though I
couldn't say for sure that it happens every time.  Then again I don't
usually die from DoTs unless a really high level casts two or three of them
on me.  I can just load both my baby heals and cast them back and forth one
after another till the DoTs go away, and I have enough HP that I generally
still have some left afterwards if I slow them down like that.
