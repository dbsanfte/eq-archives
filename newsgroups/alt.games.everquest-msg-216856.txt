And that "admittedly" part right there answers it.  Before, it was one job
that only an enchanter or a highly skilled bard could do.   And it didn't
matter that that was all they could do, since it was so important.   Now
it's a job that four classes can do, enchanter among them.   But everyone
else comes with an "and so much more" factor.

I glossed over nothing.  As both of the two characters I regularly play are
pure melee, I'm well aware of the differences between hastes, and how nice
it is to get the best possible haste.  But I also know that the 10% extra
damage squeezed out of the three melees over shaman haste is not really near
the damage output of a KEI powered wizard or mage.

I wasn't saying that enchanters bring nothing to the group.   The point I
was making is a bit older, and hardly new to this newsgroup.  The KEI whores
are continuing to hurt the chances of an "honest" enchanter to find a group.
Especially mid / low 50's, but even at 65.   The effect is just more visible
and pronounced, now that 90 minute adventures are the standard group.

Believe it or not, I don't really enjoy doing groups using charm.  Assuming
a best case scenario, it's still a cumbersome weapon that is not very easy
to use.   It's also a weapon that if anything goes wrong, due to either bad
luck or incompetence, can create more hastle than it is worth.   One add at
the same time as a charm break and an unfortunate resist, and you're
standing over the body of a dead enchanter with 3 active mobs in camp, 2
unslowed one possibly hasted and no easy crowd control.

If an enchanter wants to charm, I won't try to stop them, unless they've
displayed prior incompetence.  (Yes, many very humorous stories about bad
enchanters are not being related at the moment. Maybe later.)  But I'm also
not going to suggest it to an enchanter who doesn't want to do it or is not
comfortable with it.   I'd rather make do with the hastes / slows and crappy
nukes.
