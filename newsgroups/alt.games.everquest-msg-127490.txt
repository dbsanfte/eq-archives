Is Arch Mage for the SMR?  I forget (started my epic over a year ago).  If
so, some guildmates bought me the robe.  If that's the ink guy, I lucked out
and he spawned first thing.  A monk was there soloing the ink guy room and I
traded buffs for the chance to sit there while I waited.

If you're doing the enchanter epic I'm sure you know by now that you MUST
have friends in order to do it.  Just grab one or two 50+ or a group of 40+
and camp the robe guy and get xp while you wait.

www.allakhazam.com has a list of bestiary by zone, with information on how
to change factions.  I have no idea what factions you have to work on,
sorry.
