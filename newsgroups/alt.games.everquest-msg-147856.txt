I could not agree more... I have been in Crystal Caverns since 30....
now 38 (whoot ding last night).  I have attempted to leave to see new
zones, but this is the one that is keeping me in plat and the exp is
FLYING by.

Aye Rallic Pac is just the way to go... His cleric could probly do the
camp... matter of fact... I gave my clerics Rallic pack to my Monk...
much more usefull there.


Me... send Sekani a tell and if there is time I can hook you up with
an Herbalist pack  6 slot 25 % wt reduction.  good place to stick
those heavier Items until you can get a better pack.
