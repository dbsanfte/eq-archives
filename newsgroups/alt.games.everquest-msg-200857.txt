Yeh.  A day ago I had my whole system apart.  I thought maybe I had a power
supply going bad because there were times when it crashed that I would get
an immediate reboot.  I replaeced the power supply with a 400 watt ANTEC
true power model.  Then, last night while fighting in DL I crashed.  Wierd
thing was when I logged back in I was on the other side of the zone.  I
think that is just an EQ bug.
