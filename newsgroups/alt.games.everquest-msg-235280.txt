They'd *better* not wipe the points.  Many of us spent a lot of time,
effort, and plat building up our tribute points.  Wiping the points
would screw everyone, not just the worst abusers of the "oops" items.

At most I hope they decide that if they can't just say "my bad"
and leave the accumulated points alone (they're expendable after
all, it's not like anyone got a *permanent* leg up), then they should
just cap "banked" tribute points at the dividing line between
"that's a lot of points" and "that's insane, no one could get
*that* many points fairly."
