I, for one, am looking forward to the flaming cesspool that'll result
when an EQ2 newsgroup is created and a.g.e'ers with a bug up their
butt start flaming EQ2 players for off-topic posts, and then the
off-topic posters with bugs up their butt will start flaming back.

Hurry up and create that alt.games.everquest2 newsgroup, people!!!
