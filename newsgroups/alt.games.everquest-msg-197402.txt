*That's* the thing. Why do they have to be filed through the trial all at 
once? Of *course* you don't monopolize a few players' time with it. Keep 
the demands reasonable. You know, compromise.

If you're still working at it, you might hit up the folks in this thread 
(not this sub-thread, of course) who mentioned their less traumatic trial

I would think the limit would work in the smaller guild's favor, 
requiring fewer of the necessary caliber players. I could be wrong there.

Well, I was thinking something more along the lines of one day out of 
their gaming week at first. Would that be unreasonable? I don't think so.

Thanks for your insight.
