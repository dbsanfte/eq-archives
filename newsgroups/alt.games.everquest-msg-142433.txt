To an extent.  Look at it another way, shamen and druids are Healer + combat
caster.  Paladins are healer + melee.  And judging from the relative solo
ability, I'd say shamen and druids got the better of the deal.  I know
they're considered "pure" casters, but you can also view them as a
cleric/wizard hybrid, only with a different set of spells.

I still maintain that there is only one main healing class in the game, and
that's the cleric.  Paladins, shamen, and druids are meant as backup
healers.
