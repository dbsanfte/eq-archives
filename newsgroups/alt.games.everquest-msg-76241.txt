40 is the first level I've hit with my druid, my main and highest ever char
in EQ btw, and I'm thinking to myself 'holy shit'.  And this folks, is 1
yellow into it - solo.

Hadn't logged in for a long while, then once I got SoL I went ripping off to
the GF Nexus portal, walked straight up to the Scion, said a Hail and for
some dumbass reason hit my attack key heh.  She pretty much handed me my ass
in a basket in about 2 hits and it took  me back to under a full yellow.

Gotta say though, *now* I see why the term 'hell level' so aptly fits.  30
and 35 were easy.  On the upside, if I can just keep from doing silly things
and getting killed, I should be able to progress nicely just exploring alot
of the new Luclin content.  And now I've discovered how cool it is to have
this level 40 Druid with not much plat, but a veritable shitload of plat for
my level 3 VS BL.  Now if I can only camp them both in one of those rooms in
that confusing kitty city and do a little exchange.  I think I'm twinking.
