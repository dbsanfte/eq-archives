Using it as a single basis for proof would be flawed logic.  But it *is*
proper to use it as one piece of evidence.  If it can be shown (as claimed)
that crime went down after concealed use was legalized then together the 2
pieces are very strong evidence.  Not a logicians proof, but enough for a
reasonable person to be convinced.  Anyway, requiring a 'logical proof' for
an argument about large groups of people is itself flawed thinking.  Most
arguments about the behavior of a large group of people can *never* be
decidedly proven.
