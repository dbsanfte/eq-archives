GMs and guides can go anon and not be detected by anything except ShowEQ.
(So if you have ShowEQ or other hack, and acknowledge them, you've just
betrayed yourself as violating the EULA).

As a general rule, guides are not allowed to be anon/invis. They are that
way only for investigations. However, GMs usually are, to prevent tells
straight to them.
