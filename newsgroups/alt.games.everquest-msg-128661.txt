you're right in that dex only affects how often a melee attack will land
(and ranged melee & rogue stuff)

after asking tons and tons of wizards about the new ability, i've heard that
it IS random - lvl of spell, lvl of mob, your INT and so forth is all
irrelevant

. . . which stinks

if any changes have been made though, and it turns out that yada yada there
is something to do, then flog me to a pulp
