You're getting stuck on the slow percentage number itself, when the
effect of slow on enemy damage output works out to be:
(enemy damage) = (enemy base damage) * (100% - slow%)

This means that a 5% is not infinitely better than a 0% slow, because
(100 - 0 = 100)% damage isn't infinitely greater than (100 - 5 = 95)%.

And so, in the case being discussed, a 70% slow is 20% inferior to a
75% slow, (100 - 70 = 30)% damage is 20% greater than (100 - 75 = 25)%
damage.  The key is to compare the results of the computation to find
the effect of the inputs, rather than comparing the inputs themselves.
