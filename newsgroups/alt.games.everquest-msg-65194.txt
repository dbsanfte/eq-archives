Anyone know why my EQ sound would have quit with SoL?  Installed DX8.1, new
video drivers for Radeon 64 DDR VIVO, but couldn't find any newer drivers
for my soundblaster live.  P4 1.3, 256 RDRAM...other than the sound, all
else seems to be working perfectly, even with only the 256 RDRAM.  Well,
except for the minute long zoning times that used to take about 5-10
seconds....thanks in advance for any help...bill
