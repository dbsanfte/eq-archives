If Xev has one, I wish we knew about it. I got invited on a Hate Raid
for Saturday. Supposed to kick off around 11:00 a.m.  We showed up
early, and found a huge group at the wizzy spires in S. Ro (where we
planned to assemble.) Oddy, we didn't recognize *anyone* there. One of
our group asked about it and found out it was an entirely different
guild, also getting ready to go to Hate, and they were already set up to
leave.
*sigh*
Most of our raid party went to Kael instead.
