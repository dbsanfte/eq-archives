I was told that EQ only writes registry entries for uninstall so that 
should work fine.

However if you don't have an easy way to copy that much data from one 
computer to another, you can just copy all the files with your 
character's name in them (usually Name_servernumber.ini and 
Name_servernumber.opt), as well as your eqclient.ini file, and you 
should get your hotkey settings and chat colors transferred.  The 
character files and ini stuff are small and will easily fit on a floppy 
disk.
