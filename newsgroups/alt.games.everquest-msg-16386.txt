This won't keep you rolling in plat, but it can be done without relying on
the generosity of others if you have a newbie character in GFay or Butcher.
You can complete this series of quests.

 - Bone chips to Gunlok in Kaladim.  Keep the items he gives or cash them in
 - While in Kaladim, pick up letter bound for Kelethin
 - While in Butcher, run to the dock and get second letter bound for
Kelethin
 - On your way to Kelethin, stop by Felwithe and pick up third letter bound
for Kelethin
 - Drop letters by bard's guild in Kelethin
 - repeat

Hunt between stops for skellies or orc hatchets.

As I said, you won't be rolling in plat, but you'll be self sufficient ...
particularly if you're a caster with no need of the armor you get from
Gunlok.
