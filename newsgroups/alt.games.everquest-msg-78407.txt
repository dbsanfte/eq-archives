    Static containers, like a forge, act much differently than containers in
your inventory. Try and stack, say, two sheets of metal on top of one sheet
of metal already in the forge - you'll find they won't stack. So the problem
isn't that stacks aren't checked for when the recipe is checked after
hitting combine, it's that as far as the containers are concerned stacks
don't exist. So it's much more difficult to code. The "not a valid recipe"
thing was easy to code, as before it would check to see if it was a valid
recipe, and eat items while giving message if it wasn't. Just remove the
"eat items if it wasn't" part, and you have your new code. (Either that, or
it ate items, then checked. Quick re-arrangement of steps would fix that.)

    I'm a tradeskiller. I feel your pain, especially when I see what level
you're doing all this at. But don't look for this one to be fixed anytime
soon. Yak (the Verant tradeskills guy) has put off one of the
longest-standing tradeskill requests, multiple combines off stacks of items,
for the longest time, and this would work in a very similar way.
