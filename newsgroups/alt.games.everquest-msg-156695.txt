While the messages may say PoP has shipped, it ain't out on shelves.  At
least not in my area anyway (SW FL). Best Buy, Comp USA, EB, and Software
Etc. all have it tomorrow.  I heard some reports of Walmarts putting it out
over the weekend but all the ones around here usually get their software a
week late and I've checked three (yes I'm an addict) and no dice.  I know
today will be a cluster**** anyway with the servers, but if you say out the
21st, I should be able to walk into a store and get it the 21st.
