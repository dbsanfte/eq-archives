From the shadows, the mysterious "Breathe"
<breathe@redstarnospamsector.com> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>You can also win a "golden ticket" that you can use to "spin the big wheel
>for big prizes" with another NPC.  No idea what he gives out.

That by itself is going to guarantee a lot of pp going into it. Enough
to reduce the massive inflation? Time will tell.
