So you've never played it, but it must be awful.  It's popular, so it
must be lousy.

You know, you might want to actually (gasp) try something before
deciding it's crap.  I'm sure the picture you have is that you create
your character and your trainer hands you your epic.  Trust me, it's a
little more involved than that.  You said something about getting to
60 in 3 weeks.  Well, as I recall guilds in EQ level people up in a
couple of days.  It's HARDER in WoW because (pretty much) all  gear
has level limits, so you can't equip a newbie with level 60 gear.

What's nice is that WoW give you options.  You don't feel like
grouping?  Fine, solo.  Do tradeskills.  Browse the AH.  Just go to a
nice looking zone and look for something you haven't seen before.  But
you DON'T have to sit in one spot for months and months and months
hoping something spawns.  

A sense of accompilishment?  My guild just finished progressing thru
Zul Gurub (a 20 person instance).  Took us months of learning how to
play together and perfecting strats.  It gave me FAR more of a sense
of accomplishment than the typical EQ encounter: get lots of players
around the mob and zerg it.  I remember when I went to plane of hate,
I never even SAW the mobs because we had such a crowd. 

Taking a chance?  In EQ, I rarely took chances, because I simply
didn't have the hours and hours to get my corpse back.  The thing is,
death really just penalizes lowbies in EQ.  At some point I realized
that high levels don't care because they get their 96% rez, and the
guild necro can summon their corpse.  So all your talk about "taking a
chance" in EQ doesn't mean a whole lot.  The only difference is that
in WoW, if your corpse is in a really bad spot, *everyone* has the
opportunity to rez at the graveyard, but that rez costs you A LOT, so
you don't do it unless you have to.
