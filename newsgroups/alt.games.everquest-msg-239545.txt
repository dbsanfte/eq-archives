You might want to give Toontown Online a look-see for him.  Great for kids
... no one ever dies, the objective is to get the "Cogs" (corporate
grownups) with "Gags" to get them to laugh.  You play games to earn
jellybeans (plat) which allow you to buy better gags.

The chat is entirely scripted with drop-downs.  You don't have to worry
about someone thinking your four year old is an adult.

Character creation is pretty fun, too.

Might be worth a look.
