I -did- say you'll get a lot of counterarguement...  I would usually
say the same thing about Divine Light.. It takes too long to cast,
costs too much mana, and is no good when your enchanter is being
beaten on.  Mana Efficiency is spending 175 mana and having a live
chanter versus spending 350 trying to heal a corpse, then rezing
ing (600) buffing it back up with Heroic Bonds (cause fortitude is
less HP and its the CHANTER) and Symbol of Marzin.  CHeal for
the chanter?  Don't make me snort my Fuzzlecutter 5000 out my
nose like that!

Likewise Divine Light is slow and wasteful when casting a "hey I
don't thing Glinda's CHeal is going to make it in time" spell, all I
need is enough to stave off death an extra half second, and I need
it to hit -soon- not -later-... cause if Glinda's Judgement is any good
at all then its taken me a while to figure out its not quite good enough,
so there's little time to waste.  On the other hand when her CHeal
hit the MA it won't matter whether I've healed 100 points or 1000...
cause he's gettting a total refresh.

The most amazing thing about Remedy, though, is its range, I hadn't
really realized this until we had a little incedent with a mage falling out
of COM upper levels, and us with a rogue who had to emergency
log out.  Our paladin went out and cleared areas for the mage to try
climb and glide plans to get back up to us... and we spent 20 minutes
with her almost -never- in range of any "real" heals, but in Remedy
range.  Like all heals this goes right thru walls, up and down levels,
by moving  around the room a little I could stick heals on her over half
the zone.  It wasn't a question of effienciency, it was the only option,
and I was surprised at how well it worked.  Use it healing FD monks
who are taking a beating splitting a pull... you'll love it.

Divine Light does have its uses, as I said, but I've generally found
them to be marginal, especially now that I have Elixer; while Celestial
Healing was really running out of steam this breathes new life
into the HOT strategy... if I have time its Elixer I cast, a bigger
more efficient heal for the chanters -and- for the MA, even if
a CHeal is coming, as the remaining pulses of Elixer will heal
post CHeal damage

Occaisionally being the key word.   But thats a matter of style and
choices, I literally know clerics who rarely use CHeal and swear
by DL as their main heal.  Heck, often my principle means of healing
is Mark Of Karn!
