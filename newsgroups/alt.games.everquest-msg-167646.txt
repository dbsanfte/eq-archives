No, she let him go get his ego bruised a bit, and then pulled him
back.  Now the kid knows why she doesn't want him playing there in a
way that's far more acceptable (to him) than "because I said so".
And you can bet that if it matters to the kid that he "prove himself"
by having a character prosper on a PvP server he'll pester her about
it until she lets him try again.
