Thanks, everyone for your answers.  My primary is a 51 enchanter, but on the
rare occasion when our guild's sole 50+ enchanter isn't needed as much as a
57 cleric, I borrow my brother's account.  MY cleric is only level 24 (just
made it...GH, YAY!) so there's a lot I don't know about playing a high level
cleric.

But Mason, eq.castersrealm.com says DA and DB last 18 seconds.  Camping
takes 30 seconds.  Bad math, or is the website wrong?
