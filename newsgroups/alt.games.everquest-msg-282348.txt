Depends on level.  At 70 with a few hundred AAs, most classes regen pretty
quickly - it's fairly easy to have FT20 at the high levels.  At 50-60, most
classes are facing a LONG time to regen mana if they get low - there's lots
of +mana items, not so much FT, and base regen is lower.  

Of course, the answer is not to get low.  Find a group that can kill
comfortably using only the mana you're regenning.  This is easier said than
done, sometimes :(

"Normal" varies a lot by class, level, style, and group composition.  It's
simply wrong to say that downtime is a problem for all parts of the game - you
have to give specifics about what you're doing, and then suffer the fools like
me who'll tell you to do something else if that's not working for you.
