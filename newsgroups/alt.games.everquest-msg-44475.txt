At 17 I believe I was in High Hold Pass at the Orcs. Good Exp & loot as most
mobs drop rawhide armor & some bronze

Max out your Dex, thats the only way to increase your Archery skill quicker.
Like people that do trade skills max out Wis & Int, Archery increase with
Dex. As for use at higher levels....U & your Trueshot or Raincaller will be
best of friends, trust me....hehe....Level 52 here & still using bows to
pull or Kite in between Nukes...hehe

I'd see about getting an Ebony bladed sword or an PG Tomahawk. Both weapons
have good delays. Dam is low but good for under level 20 characters. Both
should be under your 150 pp mark & both have a nice proc to them. U might
also see about getting a Crystal fiber that drops in Crystal Caverns. Very
common drop & Lore so people usually sell cheap. I've seen them selling for
80 pp on the Solusek Ro server
