Yes, but a lot less than "Shaggeytoodope", for example. And besides, you
would still have the chance to exercise your creativity and imagination,
when you reach level 20.

I agree with you, and if Verant could promise a ruthless enforcement of
the naming policy, I wouldn't propose to enforce the name generator, but
since they probably don't have the manpower to do that

Actually, if they weren't in an existing fantasy work (The Lord of the
Rings, duh), Gandalf, Bilbo, Meriadoc, Peregrin, Aragorn and the like
would be perfectly acceptable Everquest names, and if people created
their own names with only a tenth of that flair, I wouldn't need to be
proposing that the fantasy name generator be made mandatory.
