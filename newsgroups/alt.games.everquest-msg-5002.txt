A bigger question in my mind is, why are you even CONSIDERING allowing her
into your guild?  Is she good friends of one of your guildmate's?

In the guild I'm in, we have to think of reasons TO invite someone, not
reasons NOT to invite someone.  We're damned picky.

If she asked for help (NOT if you just decided to help for the hell of it)
and then felt no remorse at your death, screw it, don't invite her.  If you
fibbed about her asking for help, the it WAS your fault you died and she
wouldn't have any reason to feel remorse.  Still, I don't think I'd invite
her.
