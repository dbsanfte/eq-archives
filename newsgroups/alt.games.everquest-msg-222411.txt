Devil's rule? White and black witch? What an arrogant farrago of
personal issues presented as doctrine.

It is worth pointing out that the Law of Thelema was propounded in the
Book of the Law, written in 1904, and which Crowley maintained was
dictated (perhaps today we would say channelled) by praeternatural
beings (the phrase itself is from Chapter 1, identified as the
utterance of the Goddess Nuit).

It is worth pointing out that this is one statement, albeit a central
one, among many which define Thelema. It is used, for example, to open
correspondence, which is closed with another sentence from Chapter 1: 
Love is the law, love under will.

It is worth pointing out that the statement "Do what thou wilt shall
be the whole of the Law" appears prior to Crowley's adoption of it in
Rabelais' "Pantagruel," along with the term Thelema and the concept of
a society based on the ethics of honorable individuals as a model
worth emulating.
" remark into a room full of contemporary Wiccans and witches, to see
how much skin they left on you.

It might be worth asking you for a source on the Rede prior to 1904,
so that your claim that Crowley was "simply...leaving out the first
part" could profit from some credibility.
