}That's only true in that very limited problem scope. If you do 1400 
}points in 'your' camp, *and* 1400 points in 'his' camp you can each get 
}2 1400 point items from, either 1 from each camp, or the same camp 
}twice. Surely there are 2 items you'd each like? And once 'they' have 
}1400 points in EF there is no reason for them not to go elsewhere with 
}you... they've unlocked everything in EF... it doesn't matter where they 
}go to get more points...although not all of them know that.

Nope.  There's 2 camps with one spell each I want, and one camp with 2 
spells.  The total LDoNing I ever intend to do amounts to less than the 
aforementioned 2800 points. *shrug*.  But in general, for any given camp, 
no, there ain't two items I want, and the most points I'll ever need at 
one camp is 650.  Despite these minimal desires, I'm only about halfway 
there after months, because people keep dragging me off to useless Guk and 
EF adventures. *shrug* At least those zones are prettier.  But it's all 
points I don't see myself ever, ever using.  

}Its even harder to get them into <insert almost any non-ldon zone except 
}for a few planar camps>. From Kael to the Grey to Griegs to Sebilis to 
}NToV ... if you want the interesting drops from places like that ... 
}make very good friends.

Yes, and that's an even worse problem.

}Whereas I look at it as working towards a 2nd item... which you can now 
}purchase from the selection of the two camps combined! 

The most points I'll ever spend on the one second item I need from a camp 
is 180.  And I have that, and more, already.

}Sure you put in 
}twice the time, but you walked out with twice the reward... that is only 
}true in LDoN... you get 6 guys who want 6 different non-ldon drops, and 
}odds are pretty good you will do 6 very long boring camps and walk away 
}with 1 item each, 2 if your very lucky. If those same 6 guys perversely 
}wanted an item from each ldon theme... and you put the same amount of 
}time in LDoN, then each guy walks away with his desiered item, and 
}enough points to get 5 more of equivalent value... that's a *huge* 
}improvement.

If it's 6 melees I can see that happening.  Most of the caster gear is 
frankly pretty pathetic, from what I've seen.  Even the spells ain't all 
that.  The one spell I was really looking forward to got yanked from the 
expansion at the last minute.

}That you can't spend the points where you would like is on par with 
}complaining that you can only get groups in PC but you want drops from 
}Befallen. You'd just go to befallen yourself if you could, but that's 
}not allowed in ldon so your upset about the points, when you should be 
}upset they don't have ldons scaled back in difficulty or with extended 
}timers or something that both allow you to solo and make success a 
}possibility. Does that hit near the mark... or am i way off?

I think his gripe is that I won't come do Guks with him, because there's 
nothing there for Enchanters.  The other way his problem could be 
addressed would be by balancing what's sold at the camps better, to make 
sure there actually -is- something for all classes at each camp.
