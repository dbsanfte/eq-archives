I think you are as full of shit as Donald Rumsfeld was
when he first span this despicable line.

Face it, your military screwed up.  The *least* those
people deserve is an abject apology - not all this

to kill women and children at that wedding, because
*really* they were *actually* terrorists, however
little they looked like that.
