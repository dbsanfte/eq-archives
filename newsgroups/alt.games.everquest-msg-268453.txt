The overwhelming impression i have by wandering around freeport is that the
quest system is huge. I'm staggered by how good the equipment money and xp
is by just doing the noncombat quests, and the combat ones put the icing on
the cake. If you can persuade a group to synchronise quests with you, it
puts the icing on the cake; i had around 4 quests asking me to kill orcs,
and the payoff at the end was massive. At the moment, i was hoping to finish
my freeport quests before betraying the city and heading off to qeynos, but
some i deleted for roleplaying reasons (vagrants don't hurt me, i don't hurt
them, but orcs and undead are there to be smashed) and in the end it will be
a close call whether i can do it. Levelling is pretty fast. Compared to eq1,
i guess they are about worth 1/3 of a normal level, which suits me fine.
Fast pace of change is a good thing.

The quests are also full of the flavour of the place. Freeport is like Hell.
Everyone is corrupt, afraid, spiteful. You get a strong impression that the
Overlord is setting up all the conflicts deliberately, and feeding off the
misery. When I played EQ1, most iksar just seemed interested in drinking, or
making money, and they seemed to have families. Only some seemed to be evil
for evilness' sake. That seems gone from freeport. The iksar and every other
race there are wretched and wicked.

If you have played planescape, you'll know the demiplane that this is like,
with the whole place sliding into the abyss. Unfortunately, there's never an
option to do anything good in the quests; perhaps the place is too far gone,
and the only way to escape it's tortures is by doing what i will be doing...
facing Lucan, even though it means death, fightin my way through purgatory,
to the paradise beyond. All very mythic.

In order to live, you have to be prepared to die.
