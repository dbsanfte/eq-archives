That's why I gave em 2 or 3 out of 5 for soloability, as opposed to the
0 or 1 I would give a warrior or rogue. I still grade an SK or monk's
soloability better due to FD. I also don't like that a ranger has to
rely on that single spell to solo well - with an SK, I got better armor
and HP, a pet to distract, lifetap spells I can cast to heal myself
during battle without switching targets, and FD as a last ditch effort
in case a fight goes bad. All meleers, IMO, are far worse soloers than
the good soloing caster classes; and among the melee classes, rangers
are behind SK's, bards, and monks.

I've been playing in groups with rangers for a long time, I know what
they can do. I was giving my impressions of how desirable they are to a
group, based on what I hear people saying about them. Most people in the
last year have not been interested in rangers very much, especially at
high levels. They would rather have the damage output of a rogue or
monk, or the much better tanking ability of a warrior/SK/pally.
