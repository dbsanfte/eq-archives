Brie is a cheese that is soft and yellowish, in a thick white rind or 
crust, that is aged slightly and best served at room temperature, though 
it can be made into sauces and soups. It is typically made of cows milk.

Feta is a goat cheese=) Friends have tried making this with feta, and 
thought it was the most nasty idea, something about the melting 
properties and overall taste of goat cheese being overpowering. YMMV=) 
but if you want to try making this with a goat based cheese, I would 
suggest using Ticklemore's hard goats cheese, it is similar in texture 
to a cheddar or gouda, the pressing and aging is what helps the melting 
properties.
