I've harrassed salesperson in just about every stores that sell EQ
games in general.  And I found those stores have one thing in common
with Radio Shack: you got question; we have blank looks.  :P

A lot of the stores had DoD, several had OoW, a few had DoN.  One had
PoP and GoD (boxes were well worn and seal ripped open) but no
Platinum (or Gold or even original EQ)

I think I made a sales drone at Circuit City cry because I had DoD,
DoN. and OoW on hand and asked for the full version that was required
to use those 2.  They couldn't find it, I left 3 $30 game boxes behind
because they are useless by itself.

I do have beef with Best Buy drone: they thought EQ II would be fine!

Either every store is way past sold out or Platinum edition have been
discontinued. :(
