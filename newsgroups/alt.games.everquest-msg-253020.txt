Honestly.  A friend was done with his 65 necro so I got him
transferred to my account.
He was buck naked but I had enough to get him some old world upper-mid
gear, int is 217 but that's the long of it.

Most spells and some AA's.

So, what to do with him?  I'm still learning the class and have hit
some areas for training but I really need plat.  Where would be a good
training ground as well as decent plat/loot?

I'm not totaly incompentent with the class so no newbie suggestions.
I have grouped with him and no one seemed to notice I was unskilled,
or at least they didn't comment on it.   But consider him a mid-50's
necro for purposes of skill.

Thanks.
