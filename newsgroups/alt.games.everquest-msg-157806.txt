As a tank, you need to get aggro, keep aggro and die as needed. So go with
the faster weps, but dont sacrafice too much speed for damage, you still
need to kick some butt too!

I have been using a Lamentation (9/19) and Centi LS (14/27) as my main weps
and have a Crafted Velium Chaidmore ( 2HS 30/36) and Sarnak Battlehammer
(2HB 30/40) for a backup when i am not the main tank.

Had this combo (lammy/centi) since about L35 and really dont see myself
changing that until I can get more uber items like a Bloodpoint,
Frostbringer, LSoEE, Reaver, etc.

Also, make AC and STA your main stat buffs for items, the more damage you
can mitigate, the better.
