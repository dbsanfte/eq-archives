    And here's a bit of news for you. Do you think that "time consuming"
thing has a point? Why yes, it does! Have you ever started the first day on
a new server? It stinks. You know why? Because everyone is at the same point
in the game, competing for the same things. Having four people clustered
around every bat spawn point sucks. KEI speeds up the rate at which people
level. So instead of having people spread out amongst the levels based on
their play time, you start to clump them at the top of the spectrum. They're
all going to want something to do, but SOE doesn't want to spend extra cash
on development costs just to make the number of areas where such people can
play increase. People get frustrated, people leave.

    It is in SOE's best interests to spread the player base out. New races,
encouraging twinks, all designed to get players to abandon a higher level
character for a lower level one and alleviate crowding. KEI reduces the
amount of time such a strategy work.

    Honestly, I doubt it. I've seen people come on raids with us, for
example, who just couldn't do things right. They had slow reaction times, or
were unable to think on their feet and adapt to changing situations, or they
were flat-out dumb and unable to follow simple instructions like "FOLLOW
ME". I no longer believe anyone is skilled at EQ until they demonstrate it.

    He's a warrior, and grouped for all of his XP. His pulling never stops,
and if he sits on his ass it's because he's having problems getting aggro.
Apparently he knows how to have fun at EQ, something you never learned
beyond "exploit this bug".
