I'm a level 8 high elf Wizard. I've bought all the eight level spells I'm
planning on getting, and have about 15 pp to burn. What kinda gear should I
think about getting?

I currently have:

A bunch of cloth armor
Green sr. Apprentice Robe
Right of Frost (+3 to int +10 to mana, got it as a gift)
Ketchaca koro mis (or however you spell it, traded an ice crystal staff for
it)

And...that's about it. What's in my price range (or a little above) that I
should think about getting?
