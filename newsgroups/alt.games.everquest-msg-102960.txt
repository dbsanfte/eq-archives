Obviously you have some strong opinions on this subject and a desire to
speak about your feelings in public.  Unfortunately you are not well
informed on chemical addictions.  Alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, heroin...
makes no matter.  The body becomes accustomed to the chemical and lack
of the chemical causes distress.  Societal acceptance may change
personal feelings on one chemical over another but the underlying
chemistry is the same.  Control and common sense are great things, but
physical addiction is a break down of those things due to the distress
felt when accustomed levels are not maintained.  Those who treat
physically dependent alcoholics do indeed use other chemicals to deal
with the stress of removing the alcohol, the pain of a physically
dependent alcoholic in withdrawal is very similar to the scenes of drug
withdrawal you may have seen on tv or in movies.

That being said I do not disagree with  your feelings about self control
and self responsibility being important character traits which seem to
be fading away.  For those not truly beyond control, meaning they need
to be put away, it is the key to not only happiness but survival.  Each
person who crosses the line into absence of control at some point made
the choice to progressively relinquish control before reaching that
line.  It is not a cure for such disease, but it is the prevention.
