To me (and my druid) GF is definitely Greater Faydark. Who the heck has ever
been to Grimling Forest? Not me, certainly.

SF is another source of confusion - when agreeing to port someone there I
make sure I know whether they mean Surefall Glade (strictly SFG or SG) and
not Skyfire Mountain (strictly SFM or SM).

BB is also often misunderstood, as others have said.
