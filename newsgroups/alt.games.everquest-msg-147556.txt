<Snipped story about Larry1964's anger about the lack of a memorial in
Everquest>

I'm going to try and be as civil and respectful as possible, also let it be
known that it is not my intent to offend, berate, or ridicule you
personally. If I do, please excuse my nature.

Everyone handles things differently. Some people are warm-hearted and
gentle, some are cold and inconsiderate. I find it easier to simply not care
about others because in the end, no one cares about you.

A few years ago, my grandparents died. I did not mourn their death - I saw
no point in it. In the case of 9-11, I refuse to mourn the death of
strangers... it's simply my nature. I find it difficult to feel sorry for
anyone. However, I understand that not everything thinks the same way I do.
So I can understand the need for people to mourn. But, I do not expect pity
at any point in time, and in my opinion, they should not expect it from
others. Everyone has their own problems in life.

Overall, I've lost more respect for the television stations that did have
9-11 coverage than those that did not. My major problem with humanity in
general is how people benefit from the misery of others. It sickens me to no
end how these reporters can televise the suffering and agony of other people
with a clear conscience; how they lie to themselves and say that they are
doing the right thing. Some reporters may actually give a damn, but my
experience with people dictates that they only cover it for their own gain.
The least they could do is be honest.

Do people really need to be reminded of their torment? Do people really need
to be reminded of the sadness and pain they felt when it happened? I
certainly don't think so. I would sum the excessive coverage up to sadism
sooner than a remembrance.

I can respect the people that died, and the way I show it is by not
supporting those that morbidly display their death.

To summarize, I'm saying that everyone handles their problems differently,
and part of life is learning to accept the differences of other people. The
only people that deserve the worst life can offer are those that make others
miserable for their own gain.

In the end, it does not matter how others see your problems. It's how you
choose to handle them.

With that said, you may find this link interesting. (In case you were not
aware of it)

"The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is
marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and
comes short again and again, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great
devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at best, knows the
triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least
fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold
and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."
