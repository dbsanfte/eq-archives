    You don't use DA solely as a tool to escape a wipeout. If anything it's
poor for that as it doesn't last long enough for you to camp out, and in the
event of a REAL wipeout you'll catch sitting aggro before you make it out.

    You use it when you have to cast a heal to save the MA from the three
mobs he's tanking, and you know one of them will take a liking to you before
a SA can get more aggro than you. It's cleric Jolt/Concussion. And in a real
clearing, you use it a lot.

    Yes, I need it now. And I'll need it again soon, because that's what my
job entails - lots of being beat up until someone gets firm aggro. The
recycle time makes it pointless as a personal ass-saver. And saving others
with it is spotty, at best.

    DA, interrupted? A level 1 spell with a one second casting time? The
only time I don't get DA off is when I get stunned by the initial attack and
owned before I get unstunned. DB, yes - I've had that interrupted. But never
DA.

    Wouldn't touch it with a 20' pole. There's a TON of better AA's out
there before you get this. The one cleric I can think of that uses it in my
guild has gotten more people killed with it than she's saved, including
herself.
