And you believe the opposite - that doesn't make it true either.

Generalizations occur both ways - some of the people whining are doing it
out of selfishness, some are doing it out of ignorance and then some are
even doing it out of the very odd idea they are "EQ integrity watchdogs".
Who knows, some may even be doing it out of *gasp* - legitimate concern....

LCD's can still have fun. I generally stop playing characters at 30 as it
become less like a fun pastime and more like a second job for me after
that - so I guess I am your classic LCD. I still have fun along the way
though - and level 40's up would not even know I even existed apart from
when they need to buy spider silk or hides or whatever other latest item is
too trivial for them to harvest themselves.... Just think, at the end of the
day would it be fun being a chief if there were no indians left?
