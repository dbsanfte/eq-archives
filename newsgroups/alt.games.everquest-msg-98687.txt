I have actually percieve I have acquired more of a life since playing EQ
than I had previously which is pretty sad in a way I guess : )  I tend to
have an addictive personality and have been a very big drinker and partygoer
for over a decade. Sure I may have been a gym junkie as well before, so
maybe "healthier" (apart from the liver) but I have been injury free for the
last 3 years of EQ which is damn nice for a change. I also no longer piss
all my earning up against the wall going out every night either. EQ is not
such a bad thing to be addicted to...... comparatively...

"No time for crack...must EQ.....*twitches*......"

These days I tend to value quiet times (to play EQ especially), have healthy
savings in the bank and drink waaaaay less. I also tend to place a higher
value on thinking ability rather than just shallow physical vanity now as
well, both in myself and others.

All in all worth the 9.95 a month - bah to the "get a life" crowd. : )
