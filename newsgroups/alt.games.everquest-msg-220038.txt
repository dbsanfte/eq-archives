It has been reported that all classes are now too powerful due to twinkage.
So, in a effort to slow down the rapidly increasing numbers of high level
chars,

1) Mages will no longer be able to control their pets (a la Enchanters)
2) Necromancers will not be able to FD or fear
3) Warriors will have all hp's reduced by half
4) Shaman slows will now generate double previous aggro
5) Cleric heals will immediately move cleric to top of mob aggro list
6) BLs warders will all be level 5, and never get better
7) SK will not be able to wear plate
8) Paladins will not be able to LoH
... That's just the ones I remember,  There's something about snares being
much less effective and SoW only lasting 3 mins.  It's all a haze now as I
try to assimilate.

There's more for every class.  It's really going to make the game difficult.
From what I read, there were no changes for Rangers.  They die enough,
according to the dev team.  They will address the Ranger port issue,
however.

They are adding a new char class, it's the Gnome Monk.  They will be almost
god-like because they will have benefits for their small size (increased
chance of dodge and the ability to actually climb on many mobs to be out of
hit range).
