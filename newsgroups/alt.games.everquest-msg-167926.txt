It's a 'zone spam' mob for announcing weather, events, quests etc.  If you
track around the bridge in East Wastes you'll sometimes see four or five
blank lines on your tracking list - more 'zone spam' mobs.  Tower of Frozen
Shadow has some which trigger phrases as you pass.

"Pain and Suffering" is the infamous one, another in the Warrens is called
something like "The Rivers Source".
