Interesting, but I wonder why bother?  At this late stage in EQ's history,
with most players being high level, how often do people actually lose
corpses?

Perhaps this is something that fell out of LDoN?  To do instanced dungeons,
they needed to add a way to zone corpses, and so maybe a global graveyard
zone is now easy to do, so why not, even if it is years after when it would
have been most useful?

Better, but still not good enough for me.  For me, the result needs to go
into inventory, not on the cursor.  Also, the combine needs to be
hot-keyable.  Otherwise, it is still too much bad wrist movement.

They probably don't want to do that because it would make it so you could
raise tradeskills too fast.  Buy a buttload of ingrediants, hot-key the
combine for a recipie, and click it as fast as you can.  Having to move the
mouse over to inventory to drop the result, and then move back and click the
combine button again, slows things down.  I prefer the way they slow things
down in DAoC: the combine isn't instantaneous--the higher level the item,
the longer it takes.  I can tradeskill there with no risk of hurting my
wrist.
