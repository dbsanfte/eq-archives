If i understand the affliction focus effect correctly, it is for damaging
spells only and  should have no effect on mezz, charm, slow, tash, etc, but
only works on DoT type spells. It should work on the movement slowing spells
that have a DoT component though, like the necro darkness line.

If it is working on the spells you mention, it will probably be fixed soon.
