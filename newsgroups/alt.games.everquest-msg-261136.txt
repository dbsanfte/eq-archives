Pulling in low level LDoNs yesterday was different as well.  Lulled
mobs were adding, and a couple times non-lulled mobs failed to add.
I didn't get a chance to do any specific testing (we were racing to
complete the adv after a single fearing mob had pwned the group
repeatedly, it's always an adventure to group with true newbs), but
it appeared as if mob LOS at the moment of aggro has become more
important relative to distance between mobs when determining social
aggro.  That is, if there was clear LOS between two mobs when I
pulled one, I would get social aggro with mob spacing much greater
than prior to the patch. But, if the mobs did not have LOS at the
moment of aggro they seemed disinclined to add even when the pulled
mob pathed quite near the other.
