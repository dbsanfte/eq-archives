Actually I did exaggerate a little. The class *does* have its upside.
There's a certain amount of kudos involved with getting people through
a rough pull with HP still positive. :-) Basically there are few other
classes with the opportunities to do nice things for people that
clerics get.

It's true that clerics are sometimes spoiled in finding groups. What most
people forget is that clerics don't "stack" well - generally it's one
cleric to a group, never more, but sometimes less. As such it's usually
either feast or famine - either very easy or very difficult to get a group.

There are clerics who say they *never* have trouble finding a group.
I'm guessing that they play on server/timezone combinations where there's
a dearth of clerics - personally I have no trouble grouping weekends, a
great deal of trouble on weeknights. :-/

Sorry for the minor rant. I just get tired sometimes of those who think
that clerics never have trouble finding groups... it's not so. Granted
other groups (such as druids & necros) get a much worse deal in this
respect...
