If your below level 4 just go get killed by the guards and you will have
more food and water after that yes you have to buy it and have it in your
inventory. The npc at the fishing hut by the lake is a good one to buy from.
You don't have to buy just bread anything that is food will work.  Also as
your a druid you can forage your food but will take awhile to get it up
there to get something. Also there is a place down in the gully behind the
hill and huts in misty ticket where you will find berries. There are three
bags just click on them. They respawn so you can go back and get some more
every once in a while. Hope that helps.
