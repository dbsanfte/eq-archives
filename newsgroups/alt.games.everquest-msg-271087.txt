It does fit in with the lore of the game that Freeport would allow less
individuality than qeynos. I think Lucan't trying to make himself a go, and
encouraging the vices in people like intolerance, self-pity, bigotry is part
of what it's all about. I think his tower floats on the fire produced by the
consumption of his cities' souls.

In Qeynos, as a barbarian sharing an area with dwarves, i find most of the
area is to my scale, but there are places where i have to stoop most
uncomfortably. There's friction and griping (we miss the snow! Qeynos never
gets cold enough...) but there's a determination to get along and make the
most of things.

The frogloks miss their home, and tell you as much, and there's a quest to
try and help them, but the elves they share with allow frogloks to wade in
the fountains, and that's a sacrifice for them to do, more than it would be
for a human. Kerrans miss their plains but at least they have their fish and
a greater interaction with other races than they ever knew before. Perhaps
contact with the vah shir resulted in this race, perhaps they are the
children of both kinds.

I think they did great things with the lore of eq2, as well as the
characterisation of the npc's, and the contrast between the two
philosophies. Freeport if hyper-capitilist, alsmost satanic, polluted and
dull. Qeynos strives to find a balance between trees and factories, and it's
parks and open theatre exist because of the generosity of it's people... it
has the best parts of a religion like christianity or buddhism, or socialism
if you like. they are both ideals, unrealistic true, but i think there's a
nice philosophy lurking behind this game.
