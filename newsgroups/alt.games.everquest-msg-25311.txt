These aren't really PB AoE spells: they're not point blank, and they
work only on your party members.  The range is considerably greater
than the Word of Pain line (which I agree with you, is pretty
useless).  Group heals are situationally useful: dragon raids are a
fine example, but not often used in basic xp-grinding.

Clerics do get another AoE damage line: the Earthquake series we share
with druids.  Less mana-efficient than the Word line, and a long recast
time, but has the advantage of a far wider range.  Still, it's really
only useful for taking down large numbers of green mobs at once - which
can be handy at times.  I've taken down 6 or 7 level 30ish lizards in
Cazic Thule at once just by backing into a corner and casting Upheaval
(level 53 spell) twice.  Good fun, if not especially productive :)

Dedicated AE groups *might* find a use for your cleric AE's, but you're
much more likely to be stunning (including AE stunning) & healing in
this situation.

Slightly more useful is AE'ing Mistmoore mobs to generate lots of
positive Ring of Scale faction - keeps Gorenaire sweet.  Or killing
tons of Karana bandits for their sashes when I needed Priests of Life
faction.
