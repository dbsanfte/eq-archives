PotC/PotG will overwrite BAotR due to a higher hitpoint raise - the
mana regen is identical. And now you know exactly how I felt about
clerics overwriting my Natureskin with Hero during levels 57/58 (one
or two hitpoints less than hero, same AC, and a hefty hp regen
component I find myself missing with PotC :) )
