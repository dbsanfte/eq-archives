All groups of people will do some things differently and
tolerate different levels of behavior.   So, yes -- but I
have no idea how you'd find that out (other than going
from server to server and getting your own information)

> Basically, do servers have reputations.

That's a different question but that's true as well with
the general idea being the high-end guild processes
(FFA, rotations, etc) generally setting the "server's
reputation."   As a general rule, the more "cutthroat"
the high-end guilds, the more "cutthroat" the player
base as a whole.   Trickle down mores, etc.
