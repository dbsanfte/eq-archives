i want to start a secondary character when i want a break from my
beastlord,i really wanted a monk but from what i have read no-one is happy
with their monks any more due to being hit with the nerf stick quite
hard,shadowknights on the other hand seem to be a good tank with a few
utility spells,what i want is a rockin duo....    whats your thoughts.T.I.A
                    mike
