It's not a race, remember that...I see characters that I've helped as
newbies wearing planes armour and 50+ class titles. I've been playing since
february last year my primary has 50 days played on it and is only 43rd
level my 2 alts are 27 and 21. I know of people who have less than 20days
played on a character and are in their 50's, as said above, as long as you
enjoy the game who cares?

Oh and ignore those that think their level means they are owed respect or
that you are in some way a lesser player because you're not going on planes
raids. This is a computer game played for enjoyment, if someone suggests you
are crap at the game or calls you  newbie as an insult tell them you'd 0wn
them at Chuckie Egg, they prolly won't get your point but the reaction would
still be worth while :ï¿½)
