Close, but not exactly.  Racial skills start at 50 skill on all races (the
exception being Iksar swimming, which starts at 100.)

After that initial 50 points, the skills obey your limit for level and class.

At level 10, all dwarves will begin to learn sense heading normally, as thier
max is now 55, greater than the 50 racial bonus.   Same deal with Iksar
swimming.

Wood elves who start with Forage and Hide though... not every class is able to
learn those two skills.   If your class (warrior for example) is unable to
learn them, you will be stuck at 50 skill forever.   If you are a wood elf
rogue, who learns hide at level 3 (?) your hide will increase normally once
you are level 11, but forage never will.   For a wood elf ranger or druid,
it's  just the opposite.   Forage will begin to increase once they are high
enough to learn it and have a skill cap higher than 50, but hide will never go
beyond 50 since they don't learn that skill.
