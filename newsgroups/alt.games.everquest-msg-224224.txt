Congrat's on finally getting it...

To all:

Is there anyway to accurately verify what your faction levels are?
accurately enough to gauge the range required for this epic?

If not, this needs to be the center of an argument requesting correction.
It is the only issue of 'fairness' you can stand on.

The key to your complaint needs to revolve around the issue that they have
added a range of faction to a quest.  Just like the other parts needed to
complete a quest/epic, it seems in this case you must have an appropriate
level of faction... not too much, not too little.  Of other items, you can
verify that you have all the components, and you can verify to hand them in
a specified order.  If you deviate, you expect the quest to fail.

If there is no way for a player to validate required faction level before
completeing a quest, then the requirement is unfair.

Essentially, the player is left to guess and hope, and if they fail, their
loss.

Good Luck.
