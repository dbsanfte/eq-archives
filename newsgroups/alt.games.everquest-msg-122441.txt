Sorry TH (gotta capitalize, else it looks like a typo), but I can't
do that for ya.  Off-the-cuff rationalizations slapped atop an
emotional appeal simply don't often hold up well under fire.

Oh, and I don't mind at all being insulted as long as it's creative
and reasonably topical.  Its not as if I didn't make a target of myself.
I defended "Ilikepotatos" because I found it funny, and your jab at my
illogic was the funniest thing I read all day.
