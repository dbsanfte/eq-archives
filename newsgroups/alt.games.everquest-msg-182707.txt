The newer video cards are serious power hogs.  See the heat sink on top of 
the GPU?  Good indicator that it's going to suck a bit of power.  I don't 
think you want to take this chance.  Just go out and get a nice 400W or so 
power supply.  If you can afford that video card, surely you can afford 
that as well.
