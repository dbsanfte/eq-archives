BTW, just to clarify, I was trying to farm spider silk, but my pet really
shouldnt've had SoW, he nearly killed me when I ran low on mana and charm
broke and I couldn't outrun or recharm him, plus I had just forgot snare to
refresh my SLN. =/  Fortunately I had gate up, and gated with about 150 hp.
Probably a much more viable farming tactic with my 55 non-agro charm.
