As a 57 cleric who's constantly forming groups in the planes, I must
say, I absolutely will NOT recruit a warrior. I will wait for a
Paladin or SK to become available, even if there is a warrior LFG. I
have been in far too many groups where the warrior simply could not
keep aggro sufficiently, thus causing me to have to heal the various
other casters (MORE than negating that 25% extra healing efficiency a
warrior's HP would bring). 

Paladins and SK's also heal themselves, even if minutely. That can
still be a lifesaver in the event of a slightly-late Cheal.
