Tired of camping PoHate for SEOC,I had a closer look at some tasks
today.
Upon checking 3 Taskmasters in Kunark(2 in OT,1 inDL) with my 
67 Wood Elf Ranger I found that all 3 only had 1 task for him,and all
3 the same - "decaying Theatre".The task is to kill 10 undead Frogloks
in the sewers in Veksar.The sewers are located as far as possible
from the entrance,with mostly undead on the way.
Well,undead,Veksar,hm,hm,time to awake my 67 High Elf Cleric.
To my surprise "decaying Theatre" was not offered to my Cleric,
instead varying 4 or 5 other tasks,involving Droga,Nurga,Seb etc
with difererent length from short to long.

Any idea how that comes? I really would like to do the Veksar task
with a Cleric,while the others seem to fit more to my Ranger.
