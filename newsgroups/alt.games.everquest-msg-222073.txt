    My sympathies on that, I've had similar troubles with
twinked/powerlevelled/ebayed morons who are *also* rude as hell, and it
ain't pretty.

    I really feel that if someone's going to twink a character to the Nth
degree they might at least be polite to the genuine or at least more
honestly geared people they group with, particularly if their twinking
causes problems.

    I don't really know what people get out of twinking, to be exact. I
twinked and had a dark elf enchanter PL'd to 20 specifically for smithing
(They get a spell which debatably improves tradeskill success rates at that
level, and adding int gear undebatably increases the chance of skillups),
and later decided to take him up a few more levels just by grouping. I
picked up some more group friendly gear and made an effort to practise
enchanter grouping tactics before heading for paludal - where I discovered
just how utterly twinking destroys the game. We had a clueless warrior
pulling trains of 5-7 mobs on *Every* pull, nobody was using assist, nobody
was down with the idea that once a mob is mezzed you leave it alone, etc,
but it didn't matter. I had so much mana and my spells cost so little to
cast that I could keep 5-6 adds permamezzed no matter how many times people
woke them up. And if I got beat on? Who cares? I wasn't taking damage much
faster than the warrior, and it brought my animation's dps into play. Not
that anyone bar the healer seemed to notice that I was taking damage at all.

    The guys in my group learned absolutely jack shit about crowd control
that day. Sure I could've interrupted our exping and given some written
lessons on the basics, but we didn't need it. We ran out of mobs at the camp
before I ran low on mana. That was fun, for about 20 minutes.

Cheers,
James
