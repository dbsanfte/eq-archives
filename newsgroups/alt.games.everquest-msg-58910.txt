Here's a hint for you, too, fanboy. Dennis was right on in his
appraisal. People in RvR are doing nothing but looking for the
cheapest kills possible, and this is even BEFORE theres a point to
realm points. It'll only get ten times worse when there is a use for
them.

I guess if your idea of fun is to be one-shotted by an archer you
never even saw then more power to you. Boy don't spew this "everything
is happy" bullshit. THere are MAJOR problems with RvR and even Mythic
admits it.
