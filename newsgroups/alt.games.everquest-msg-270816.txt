Question:

I have 2 shields.
One is shield lvl 45 with str, health and agility buffs but it says that I 
am slightly overqualified for it.
the other is shield lvl 12 with no buffs and it says ..you have just started 
to realize......
Both are weight 4

my question is, is the benefit of the shield just represented by shield 
level and buffs or is there some other quality I am not recognizing??

Thanks

Josh
