No, it is nothing like BG2. The only similarity is that both games are
medieval fantasy. If you like BG2, I would say that you would probably like
EQ, but it requires FAR more of a time commitment if you want to be good at
it, and there is also the monthly fee to be aware of ($10 US, not sure how
that would translate into new zealand currency).
