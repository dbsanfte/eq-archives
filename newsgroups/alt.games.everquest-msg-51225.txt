I would guess that his guild needed (wanted?) a monk for high level
raids, and he was interested in playing one.

While there is an interesting game in EQ from 1 to 60, he may not
really have wanted to play that game with yet another character.

Since EQ doesn't let you start characters at whatever level you
find interesting at the moment, your choices if what you want
is that higher level character are to go out and make one, or
buy one, and the latter is expensive and potentially fruitless
as it exposes you to being banned.

I'm currently engaged in speedily leveling a druid up to porting
levels.  Why?  A friend and I are having some fun with a couple
low levels, and want to be able to easily move around to explore.
Her main happens to be a druid, so she can easily deliver my alt
to various destinations, but then her alt monk is stuck legging it.

Funny thing is, to increase our enjoyment of that low level game
you (and I frankly) enjoy, I'm speed leveling up to twice our
current level with my alternate alt!
