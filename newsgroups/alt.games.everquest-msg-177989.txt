Actually, I do test software.  I am aware that sometimes things come up that
are unexpected.  However this is not the first time we have heard this song.
As they are aware that problems can crop up when the servers have a heavy
load, you would think that they would simulate a heavy load to test out
whether there are problems.  Missing a problem once is perfectly acceptable,
but after that they should know better.
