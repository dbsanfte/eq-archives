I get so dang sick of people who spread these crap analogies about how it
only costs .001 cents per second or something like that.  FACT is $36 (what
it actually costs, not your claimed $30) is a lot of money for the same GAME
each month.

You say $30 is a tip?  What fantasy world are you living in????  I assume
you obviously must be a Verant employee to be spreading crap like this.

FACT is that these items Verant wants to charge extra for should have been
included in the game in the first place.

FACT is that I never eat out, so your whole analogy is worthless anyways.
And if I was to go by your stupid analogy method, I would say something
like, $36 over 100 years would come to $43,200.  What a bargain for a game.
