Don't need a guide for this everyone pretty much knows this and its ALWAYs
overcamped. Well at least on my server.

100k? On what servers? My server the fungi never goes for more than 60k and
that's high. Ususally I see at least one in the bazaar for 40-50k.

My own farming methods never reach 10k an hour but I make decent money
farming tradeskill items and sell them in the bazaar.
