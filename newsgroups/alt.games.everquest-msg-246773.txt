Again, I think I'm missing something. What does your firewall have to do 
with running an activeX app? If it's open for the activeX component you 
don't have to completely shut down the Firewall do you? Just allow it to 
go through and then turn it back on yes?

I think I'm completely missing the point of this hub bub. On the one 
hand it looks like a harmless applet that you run and turn off, just 
like you would do any other program out there, but to hear people talk 
about it after running it we're all going to be probed by aliens in bad 
places and our HD's will be e-mailed to MS or somesuch alarmist hoohah.

Nobody really believes that turning on IE for two minutes will result in 
their children being kidnapped and sent to comfort MJ in neverland do they?

OK, 1500 hits in a couple months... assuming that's 2 months with, we'll 
round down, 30 days each that 1500 hits/60 days/24hrs = just over 1 hit 
per hour. So worst case, using your number you've got a 1/30 chance of 
being hit before things are locked up again? And we're all locking 
ourselves in a panic room over those odds? *boggle* Maybe I'm naive, but 
since '93 I've only used non-ie for the past year. I've never had a 
virus, never been hijacked by any activeX components, and the most 
malicious thing I've had to deal with has been spyware cookies but who 
cares about those, just remove cookies every once in a while.

*Grin* Maybe I'm in the internet burbs and y'all just hang in the 'net 
hood rofl. :)
