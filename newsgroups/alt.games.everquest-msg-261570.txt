Probably a matter of personal preference, but in a scenario like that 
where I'm getting a lot of resists, I would choose to malaise first on 
all slows. I'd rather each slow take 8-10 seconds and have a *much* 
higher chance of landing than risk a high frequency of not being able to 
get them slowed in under 12-15 seconds if at all. Once you hit 15 
seconds, your mana efficiency takes a huge nosedive. You very often end 
up having slowed them for a lesser portion of the fight and having had to 
cast an extra spell to do so.

YMMV.
