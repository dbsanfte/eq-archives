Couple questions re: Tribute

1) GoD required? Or is this part of the basic game now?

2) Any idea what the cost of a tribute point is?

I heard you could use the system around level 10? Is this a technical
truth... as in ... yes if you have a whole group pooling resources,
and you spend all the proceeds to do it... or is it pretty reasonable
to add a couple points of FT for example?

On a related note...

I can't beleive they made it droppable items & plat  instead of
no-drop. Good job finding something for people to need whacks of plat
for, lets make patronizing ige more tempting.... while maintaining the
status quo on the fiasco that is no-drop stuff.

Hell they could even add stackable no-drop tokens as tribute, in
addition to putting large tribute values to much of the top end gear
that usually rots on corpses or gets destroyed during equipment
upgrades.

Couple questions re: Leadership

1) GoD required?

2) What is the approximate level of a leadership skill point.... is
this endgame stuff or would the tremendously useful ability to see
buffs or mark npcs going to make its appearance on 30th - 50th level
players?

3) If 1) is yes... Do non GoD players benefit from GoD leaders?
