Two thinks make you money: quests and the chests that drop off monsters. If
you wanted to max monetary reward, go and farm greenies where you can mow
them down quickly and pop as many chests as possible. Being a rogue helps
here as reduced downtime from traps.

For leveling - forget xp grind, you grind this game for money and not xp (at
low level) as far as I can see. Just start looking for quests. Not only will
you learn the layout of your home city well but after a few hours questing
your xp bar zooms along.
