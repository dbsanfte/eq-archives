I like this method, except generally Medieval humans were not six feet
high, but closer to 5'6" ~ 5'9". Close to todays average height for a
human male. Also, the EQ humans just don't "look" 6' tall, they "look"
closer to 5'6" ~ 5'8". To me, anyhow. This could also be because I'm
5'9" IRL, and as an Iksar often find myself looking down on the
shorties. :)

Any rate, a few inches can make a big difference when trying to
determine about just how big Norrathian continents really are. I'm not
getting into how zones do not mesh together neatly like a puzzle to
form a cohesive land mass just yet.

Xiphos - Kunark is a wonder of scaling; Lake of Ill Omen alone prevents
any of its surrounding zones to touch if laid down side by side. It's
HUGE!
