<snip long but good post>

Taking it in the order that I remember.

I used to be a GL in EQ for 3 years (pity me).  It was our cast-in-stone 
policy that you have to post before getting a tag (we had other requirements 
of course, but nothing else germane).  A strong guild MUST communicate 
outside the game and if the person doesn't prove smart enough to post we're 
better off without him/her ("I don't have TIME to visit boards AND play" is 
bull when reading the board can be done WHILE playing and only takes 5 
minutes to scan at least subject lines (which were required to be 
descriptive if you wanted anyone to read them)).  Anyway, back on topic it's 
a good policy...stick to your guns. :)

The main point of this post is this (changing the subject):

It's your guild.  Regardless of rules that you've set up about inviting or 
deguilding people YOU are the one who is in the unenviable position of being 
in charge.  YOU can delete anyone you like, regardless of reason.  Obviously 
you have to be pretty sane about it (and you CERTAINLY were in this 
instance) or you'll lose members but it IS within your right.

I probably wouldn't have discussed it with the officers or him.  As soon as 
he admitted he was the same guy I would have probably deleted him, put him 
on ignore, and told the guild that it was either him or you, and you weren't 
going anywhere. :p
