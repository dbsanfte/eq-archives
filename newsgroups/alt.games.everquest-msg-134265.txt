I'm in the same boat with Lance. Except about a month ago when this
thing was announced, I *forced* myself to switch to full screen. The
only way it was usuable was to make the entire chat box solid black,
thus blocking out my view of a portion of the screen.  You can't imagine
my relief at seeing this. Now I will have more color options, etc. for
the chat box.
