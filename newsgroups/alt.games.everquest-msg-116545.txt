Good story. Thanks. Lot's of interesting things seem to happen in Oasis,
even for those not grinding through their teens.

One of the level 50 wizards in our guild was working her monk alt in
Oasis yesterday morning and announced on /gu that she had gotten
suddenly smacked down by a Sand Giant. She was a bit peeved and decided
to log on her main to go teach him some manners.

Arriving back in Oasis with the wizard, she saw that it was not any old
SG that had done her in, but Cazel.  Of course, now that her dander is
up and she's broght the character all the way from Vellious, it's become
"an issue" and she decides to solo Cazel for revenge for many past
crimes, ruining her homeland, what-have-you.

You can guess how that went.

Tiru logged on and went and rezzed her. One of our 55 druids, hearing
her story, ported over and agreed to go help her in her revenge scheme
to lay Cazel low. I was completely shocked to find out that nobody had
ever told them that you have to keep dots on Cazel at all times to stop
his ungodly regen. They apparently flushed multiple ice comets and
starfires into Cazel. The druid made it over the zone line to N. Ro as
the wizard died a second time. After the third rez they gave up and
left.

/sigh
