i have looked at the max skill caps posted on the Rangers glade weppage, it
says that my 1hs skill is supposed to max out at 240, but it has stalled at
200 ??? have they changed it or will it stall at a certain level and go up
on a much later level ?? is there anything i need to do ?? (other than whack
at blue mobs ).

please someone enlighten me  :)
