     Correct.

     If you don't want to change your default, put "/say" at the
front where you'd normally put "/shout" or whatever.

     If you want to make that your default, use "/channel /say"
(or maybe it's "/channel say").  It works, even though "/help /channel"
forgets to list that one.  Or, you could just not bother memorizing
text commands and use the graphical interface -- right-click on your
message box when you're not in full-screen mode.
