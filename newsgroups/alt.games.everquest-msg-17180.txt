As a side note this robe he had on was worth more plat than all of my equipment
put together .. and he was begging from me?
But I'm pretty new to the game and I guess I kinda equated GUILD with GANG,
(which is totally absurd now that I think about it but it's never come up
before).  We don't want any trouble - especially when you are an iksar, it's
not like you can just move to the next iksar town down the road :) 
On the other hand, we DID see 2 other guys in the same guild and I immediately
wondered if they were buttheads too.  And thats definitely not fair to THEM.  
So I guess I'll let his guild know... thanks for the input.
