It's a blackish CD with goldish lettering that says,
"Everquest
EQ INVASION
TOUR 2002"

It was in a thin cardboard sleeve/mailer with a drawing of the USA on it.


When I start it, there's a blue woman (I think) sitting on a reptile of some
type and it says, "The legacy of Ykesha"

In the EverQuest.log file it says this,

[20:36:53] Log Session Open
[20:36:53] EverQuest Patcher version 1.0.25
[20:36:53] System Date is: 06/30/2003 08:36:53pm
[20:36:53] Command Line: Everquest.exe
[20:36:53] ---------------------------------------

(and lots more stuff too, btw..)

And probing around in dbg.txt I find this,

[Mon Jun 30 04:18:39 2003]00000:Loaded EQGfx_Dx8.DLL EQGfx DLL Version
1.1.66 Last Build Date: May 19 2003 14:58:19  Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU

[Mon Jun 30 04:17:55 2003]00019:EQMain.dll Version v2.0.18 Jun 17 2003

These things should tell you at least what I've got eh??

Thanks!
