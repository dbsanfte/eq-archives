I find just engaging someone in conversation is fine for finding who
is trustworthy. It's easy to find those who won't be trustworthy just
in the course of talking about completely different things.

Another way is to buff them up (if you can) and see how they respond.
"thx" means keep looking. But if they start talking like a normal
person, you might have a chance. They buff you back, and you may have
a winner.

Just takes a bit of low key testing beforehand and you'll see who can
be trusted and who can't.

But regardless, I wouldn't try it with anyone playing someone they
don't care about (low levels etc).
