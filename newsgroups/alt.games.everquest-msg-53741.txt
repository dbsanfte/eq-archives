Could be, but probably because we'd move so fast that the referees
would get dizzy watching us.  Of course we aren't limited by these
rules during duels, which is why no melee class ever wants to duel us.
Something about 230hp/tick DoTs and being unhittable that scares even
the dumbest tanks.  (Of course there is one monk in my guild with 150
to all resists who I always end up in a draw after 20 minutes, his
fungi tunic combined with his resists justs turns it into a rather
entertaining game of tag.  Now that I'm only 3 levels below him I may
have better luck, might try while waiting for a certain dragon to
spawn tonight.)
