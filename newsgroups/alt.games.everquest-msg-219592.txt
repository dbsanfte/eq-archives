On Vallon Zek at least thats simply not true. Ive gotten guildies from 1 to
17+ in under an hour with my druid.  Pet Classes are able to get even
further in an hour, as I can cast 60+ spells on them, and a 40 pt DS is
simply devestating when combined with Replenishment, and Protection of the
Nine. The spawns in PC are fast, VERY fast, and theres a LOT of areas near
the SWT, and HSM zones that are VERY underutilized because, as a rule, must
people dont like hunting the fiends.
