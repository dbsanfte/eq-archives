SOmeone died "in a well" today.  He couldn't drag the body but had it targetted.  I
went over, used assist to target, rezed him, wasn't paying much attention really.
Wandered around a bit, went back over where he had had been standing... and fell for
20,000 damage.  Ah, -that- well (elevator shaft it turns out, just as you mention)
