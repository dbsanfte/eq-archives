Frankly, an accusation of cheating and the banning of a level
60 account is not "the least little excuse."  Did the guy react
badly? Sure, but the GM certainly could have been a little
more empathetic, given that the gm's error caused him to
be angry in the first place.

Despite the guys anger, Kriggan owed him an apology. A simple
"I'm sorry for some reason I could not see your horse, I was
*wrong*" would have gone a long way to defuse this.  Perhaps
followed by a "I handled that badly and will more fully investigate
before making accusations the next time something like this comes
to me. I understand why you're upset."

Both sides acted badly here, the difference being that one side is
a customer service staff member who is paid and should be trained
to know better.
