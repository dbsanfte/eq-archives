How is this different from a pet class letting their pet take
a mob down to almost nothing then poofing it (mages can reclaim,
which allows you to get a substantial part of the mana back).

I did this to PL my 2nd account cleric, let a 49 fire pet eat
a mob until it ran, reclaim, and finish it with a nuke.
