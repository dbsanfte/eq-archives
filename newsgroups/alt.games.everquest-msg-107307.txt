I completely agree. When you port, it should be on your terms. So, if
you don't want to do it, don't. That doesn't put me in the wrong for
wanting to pay you for the service.

I can't pay for a SoW until I retrieve my corpse, so "/shout Paying
for a SoW" is out of the question. Also, it takes a LOT longer to run
there than it does for two ports, SoW or no SoW.
