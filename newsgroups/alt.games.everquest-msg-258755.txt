Yup, definitely can refresh the track window without closing it,
and yes this can give skill-ups.

Also, you can close the tracking window with /stoptrack, which
also turns off the messages telling you where your current track
target is.  (Useful for when you find the mob and want to start
fighting it.)  So you could make a hotkey for /doability <track>,
/stoptrack, and tie that to your turn-arrow, though frankly moving
or shrinking the track window out of the way is probably simpler.

Another belated tip: If you know that you're planning to run the
tracker until he finds the mob you want (as opposed to just popping
in now and then to check if the mob is up), I've find it's a good
idea to run your "real" character over to the zone and camp first.
That way, once you track down the mob, it doesn't take as long to
switch characters so the mob won't have wandered as far.

In some cases, you may even be able to use the alt to kill the mob.
Even if the item you need is no-drop, you can switch and ninja-loot
against yourself. :-)  I've done this a number of times with my
druid finding stuff for my monk.
