I notice the same thing with the mana bar.  The first cast of a
100 mana spell like Barrier of Combustion shows barely any white.
but if there is already white showing, that same cast seems to 
take up far more of the bubble.  (my alteration spec is 50, so
I doubt I consistently get the roll on that cast from full mana).

I think it's just a strangness in the display on the bar.
