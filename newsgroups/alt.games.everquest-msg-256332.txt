Agreed, though I do like the faces and hairstyles of the female high
elves.  A bit more "cutesy" than they used to be, but pretty for what they
are.

The only races I can easily say they did good were the ogres and trolls.
But what's not to love with races that are supposed to be ugly?

The only races that make me go GAH! outright, though, are the humans,
kerra, and the pure elves.  (Half-elves are OK, I just wish you could have
natural hair colors more easily.)
