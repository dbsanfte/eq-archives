The problem as it currently exists is twofold.  Paladins and SKs can take 
damage almost as well as a warrior in an xp situation, and can easily 
hold agro in order to be the ones taking damage.  Warriors can take 
damage better, but, not enough so to overcome the fact that they have a 
much harder time holding agro.  For some raid targets, where the 
defensive discipline is just about necessary, the warrior is still king, 
but, even on raids, many targets do not require that discipline in order 
to be taken down.  If you don't need it, then a hybrid plate class that 
can lock down agro is much more desirable.  It used to be that the other 
plate classes could not take damage anywhere near as well as a warrior, 
and that made them a lot less desirable.  Equipment upgrades have made 
the difference very small now, and, given the added benefits that the 
plate class hybrids bring, they became highly desirable.
