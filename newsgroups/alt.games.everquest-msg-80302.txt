Are you looking at the nice handy maps on EQ Atlas? Personally, I would
never be without one. (And a big THANK YOU goes out to all who mapped these
zones for the rest of us!!) They tell you all about where you should and
shouldn't wander. Look at them. Print them out. They are invaluable, and I
don't look at this as "cheating" or in any way diminishing the game -- it
pays to be aware. Go get those maps!!! Best advice I can give you.
