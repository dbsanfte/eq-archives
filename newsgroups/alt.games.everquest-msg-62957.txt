Why would you be constantly loading graphics over and over?  If you
are going to, say, Chardok, download the Chardok map (and the maps
you'll need to travel there, like BW).  When you are done with your
Chardok raid, you don't have to delete those maps.  You keep them on
your hard disk.  You never have to download them again.
