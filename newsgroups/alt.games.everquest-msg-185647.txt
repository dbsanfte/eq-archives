I don't have a problem with people talking about Cancer. But when
someone takes it on as a name in game, the only possible reason they
could have to do it is to shock people. People that do things with the
specific intent of offending others need to be smacked upside the
head.

Talking about it is fine. Taking it lightly, making jokes about it,
and such, yeah, you're going to offend me. And I highle doubt I'm
alone.

As for the Tastes Like Chicken guild name, I can see either side. I
don't see grounds for yanking the guild's name unless they make it
clear that they intend the sexual referrence with it. If it's a guild
full of Frogloks, I can understand it completely and definately see
humor in it, although I wouldn't think it goes along with the spirit
of the game...
