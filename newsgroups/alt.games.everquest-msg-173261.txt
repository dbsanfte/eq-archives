I DO give a flying fuck so speak for yourself Bizbee. In fact I'm terribly
distraught over this. I mean here is a total stranger that's been playing
for a WHOLE week and now he's leaving because there's not enough content.
Are you listening Sony??? This guy wants content-DAMMIT!  Customer
satisfaction just ain't what it used to be.  I personally feel responsible
for convincing everyone to play EQ regardless of their own preferences and I
really feel like I've failed this young man.

In fact I'm so upset I think I'll give up EQ altogether, it's things like
this that are just to damn stressful.  I think I'll take up knitting.  In
fact maybe Grubworm should too.  Knitting is highly interactive, has endless
content and a sweater is VERY different from a hat.
