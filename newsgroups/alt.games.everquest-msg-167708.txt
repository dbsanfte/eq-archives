I have a lvl 33 bst on Antonius Bayle and I've run across a problem ...

He cant afford a new hand to hand weapon

This is his profile http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=481920

And as you can see hes still using the ulak I brought at lvl 5 =(, Its not
that I cant save money, I could given a week or so raise around 3k, BUT that
doesnt seem to be enough to buy anything other than psus, fireclaw Talons
(which I already have in the bank for when they proc at 37) or a fist of
horn.

What weapon should I be looking out for ? or can I quest a weapon with
alittle help from my guild (I'm the lowest most average around 40 plus) ?

Please help and make me a happy troll once again =)
