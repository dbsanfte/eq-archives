At first I was all excited to hear about Luclin.  "New gaming engine"
"higher resolution" bla bla.  But now I am starting to realize just how much
this affected a good portion of the current players.  There are many in my
guild who are at the moment "DONE" with EQ because their systems are (1) not
upgradeable  and (2) can't afford to upgrade.  What Verant has done is
turned EQ into EQ2 on the fly.  I hear on some board of class action
lawsuits being considered because Verant is still shipping and selling the
original EQ trilogy which states Win95 as an allowed platform when the "new"
requirement for directX8.1 won't run under Win95.  Tuff luck for those
people getting the original right now.

I can see Verants point though as they had little choice with the new
competition out there today.  If they had released and EQ2 with up to date
graphics and uber hardware requirements, just think what would have happened
to current EQ.  It would have rapidly faded as players left in droves for
the "better,newer"? EQ2.    Not to mention that they would have had to run
twice as many servers to handle the additional load.

It almost seems like a "no win" situation for them.

Will be interesting to see how the next few months play out.

Orlun, xev
