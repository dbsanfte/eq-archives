Most people?    I know.. *1* monk with "epic" fists, and as a main puller in
one of the servers biggest guilds, I tend to talk to a lot of other monks

It was a nice idea, but the ratio on those epic fists completly blows for
the effort and work you have to put in, especially if you were human...
They kept it Kunark quality, even tho it was put in the game after Luclin
came out..
