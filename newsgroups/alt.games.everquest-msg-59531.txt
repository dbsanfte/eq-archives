Well since you are a 35 ranger so have sow, I'd say quickest if you
don't want to go through timorous is get a port to the dreadlands
(good luck) then run through the tunnel and follow left wall past the
first opening where there is grass (thats burning woods) and go in the
next one on the left which is frontier mountains. 

Once in frontier mountains you more or less run straight along the
right wall as far as you can then head to the left a bit and turn
right and go into overthere. If you get to  droga, with goblins
casting and beating on you, then you missed the turn to overthere.

The problem is you are going to need a bind, so my suggestion is you
just take the shuttles from the butcher docks to firiona vie then get
bound there. Its a lot faster than the above route really because
unless you really know it you could likely die, and you'll die at some
point so you need a bind anyway. There is now also a bind point in
Frontier Mountains but its kind of in the lower middle of the zone and
I just don't think I'd chance popping up there.
