I don't see it as an exploit but game design. A feature.

Huge negative effect. Sorry haven't seen that at all. Only negative effect
is that Sony has made so many improvements to the game the Nerf calling
crowd has gotten bored. So has a new target. /shrug.

Jerk players have always abused groups. Loot hogs porting out to sell.
Leaches going for a smoke every 2 minutes and afking exp. Rezzers leaving to
rez and make plat. Porters porting to make plat. Stupid players will play
stupid regardless what spells buffs are or are not in use.

The nature of boards is that the unhappy 2 complain. The happy 1000's don't
say a word.

I have the same attitude with this as with every other NERF rant.
I ask what does it hurt my gameplay.  With Kei None. If you want kei get it.
If you don't don't.
If you play real stupid I will use /note.

For years the Nerf whiners have always had an issue with the "BIG PROBLEM
that RUINED EQ"
Same result with nerfs. Always. And allways will be. For the nerfed,
unhappiness. For the unnerfed, so what. For the Nerf calling crowd, silence
for a day, until the next  "BIG PROBLEM that RUINED EQ"
