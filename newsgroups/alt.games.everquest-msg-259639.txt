Hey Tuva!

Sebu (on Drinal- we know each other a bit ;) is wearing one, and I must
say I like it a lot. The truly cool thing is that there is a FT2 aug that
is chest only slot 3 for 500some points in Everfrost. I searched a long
time for a good BP and I do think thats the best available for a
nonraiding cleric.
