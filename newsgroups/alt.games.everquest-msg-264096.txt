Julie,

Just a note to let you know that the other "reply" to you (the one with the 
"Apology accepted" response) did NOT come from me. For whatever reason, 
someone is attempting to impersonate me. One of you usenet wizards out there 
that can analyze headers and such, take a look at the two messages (that one 
and this one) and see if you an verify what I'm saying. If I'm right about 
this, some asshat is testing to see how close they can get, probably before 
they launch something more overtly offensive.

Life on Usenet, it gets more interesting every night.
