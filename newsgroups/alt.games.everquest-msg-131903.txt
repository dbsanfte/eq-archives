}> }> Heck, I came within aggro range of my ex mom in law a while back,

}> }Huh. I didn't know you could divorce your in-laws...
}> Heh, you know what I meant... :)  
}Well, yeah, but THAT doesn't make for any fun newsgroup replies, now 
}does it? :D

True enough, true enough. :)

}> enough not to become KoS.
}Or else the loot you drop is so pathetic, *nobody* wants it ;)

Doh, ouch!  And here I always just thought it was damn nice of my ex not 
to loot me for all I was worth.

Of course, it's possible I con red to her... maybe I just didn't get close 
enough for proximity aggro...

}> }(but what does your wife think?)
}> Well, she left me.  Makes it pretty clear what she thought, really. :)
}> (Note to any weird anti-EQ people planning to spam the group:  No, she 
}> left -before- I started playing EQ, not -because of- EQ...)
}You're not supposed to admit that!  Blame the game!  Blame society!  
}Blame everybody!

Why?  It was clearly my fault for marrying the wrong woman.  Well, ok, she 
married the wrong gnome too. :)

}(besides, there are perfectly normal anti-EQ people out there.  They're 
}called Mac owners, and they're just bitter.  For now... >;))

Well, since I was only trying to get the -weird- anti-EQ people not to 
spam the group, I guss these supposed normal ones can do as they see 
fit...

I dunno, I'm using a mac right now.  It does all these weird things 
periodically that seem like they'd make EQ freeze up randomly...  Weird 
HD access that seems to make everything freeze for a minute, etc.  But 
what I really know about macs is very very little.  Maybe there's a way to 
make all that stuff stop.  Or maybe it's because this is Mac Os 9.

And wait a sec, are you calling mac owners 'normal'?
