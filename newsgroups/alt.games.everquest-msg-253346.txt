And that, i think is where roleplaying in mmorpgs in particular fails so 
dismally. In a P&P rpg, someone can rp a bastard and it can be great fun 
for the whole group. No one is offended when that character tries to 
sell one of them into slavery for a new sword, etc...

In EQ you can only RP 'good, reliable, honest, fair people' or everybody 
thinks *you* are a jerk. Its not much of an outlet for roleplaying if 
have to embrace such a rigid character framework in order to be accepted 
by anybody else.

If I group with RL friends though, suddenly I am free to RP a true 
'character'. My friends know its not a real person, and the characters 
neurosis, foibles, quirks, difficulties, and whatnot else are taken for 
what it is: entertainment.

Moreover I would be quite uncomfortable with the notion of somebody 
considering that neurotic bastard character as their friend, because 
that isn't me... I made him up to amuse myself and others. If your 
amused by him great, if he serves as a vehicle for "me" to make friends 
with someone new great, ... but if I found out someone considered "him" 
their friend... I'd be creeped out; that character isn't 'me', and that 
character doesn't doesn't have much in common with 'me', not by a long shot.

To me, rp is like writing or acting, the characters are their own 
entities. Claiming to be friends with my rp'd character would be like 
claiming to be friends with Harry Potter or Darth Vader.
