  There's nothing wrong with numerous /petitions on the same subject.
Relavent information that one person may leave out, the next person may
provide.  It can help them draw connections about where the problem is, or
confirm if there is indeed a problem.  If the staff starts seeing a lot of
duplicate stuff, it can't be TOO difficult for them to start disregarding
it.  A little time consuming, but I think in most circumstances they'd
rather have too much information than not enough.  Of course, /petitioning
just to whine is dumb.  If the situation really gets out of hand with people
/petitioning, they can broadcast a message saying "please don't petition on
this subject, we're aware of it, thanks"... a request that you should
respect. :)
