I'm currently threateningly with N Freeport. I'm dubious everywhere else
though (actually apprehensive to the evil guilds).
I'm a Dark Elf Necromancer.
I need help/advise on raising N Freeport faction that doesn't require allot
of platinum pieces, and doesn't involve VERY long time of killing orcs.
I've went through 3 levels killing orcs in groups (of 6, so getting even
less EXP per faction hit, therefore causing me to get more faction than
normal) and still am dubious to commons residents, Freeport, and KOS to N
Freeport.  Doing the belt quest, I noticed it looks like the penalty for
turning them into the militia is greater than the reward for turning them
into the warrior's guild (for the "Knights of Truth" part of it anyway).
    Anyone know of a good way to increase faction? I looked at the orc pick
one for WC, but it LOWERS the one I need.  I mainly need the banking in
Freeport. I've always got the merchants in the EC tunnel who will sell and
buy with me.
    Do they just hate me because I'm a Dark Elf or a Necromancer?
