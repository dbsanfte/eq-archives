From my personal experiences I would disagree with a couple: 
> Asheron's Call:    7.5
  Asheron's Call: 2
I could never ever find people to group with, I tried and tried,
everyone was just running from one place to another, and when I asked,
they all just buffed me and kept running.

> Star Wars Galaxies: 6.0
  Star Wars Galaxies: 3
Unless it changed *a lot* in the last months, nobody ever grouped
there, since pretty much everyone could solo a krayt dragon
