Actually it's someone else making it happen. Any raiding force will be
repelled by the 4 defenders that spawn (no matter what the race on either
side) the only way to get a side to win is kill the defenders when they
spawn and so the Raiders have no opposition and take control of the caves or
village.
Someone is killing the Owl Bear Defenders, that's why it is happening.

I still have no confirmed way of resetting zone.
When one side has totally won a named of that race is meant to spawn near
the Trading post, kill him and the zone resets...not seen it yet tho.
