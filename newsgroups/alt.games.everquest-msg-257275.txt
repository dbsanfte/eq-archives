At least Talon got the word right.  I should imagine if you're going
to play "did not"/"did to" that you would be more careful of spelling.

Also, SOE has mostly been improving the game with the exception of
some irritating nerfs.  I used to work my characters Sense Heading
skill, and got my Mage to 165+, when LDoN came out and gave everyone
200.  Now that's a wasted effort.
