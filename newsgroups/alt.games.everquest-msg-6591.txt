Is there a good enchanter guide on the web? After having brought a monk to
level 21, I'm a bit bored with melee and slow progress, so I wanted
to try out a party helper class like enchanters. Reading through
their spells however seems to tell me that it's either impossible
to solo or extremely slow. Should I dare starting one? The idea
of helping out is something I like and I didn't want to become
the everboring healer...
