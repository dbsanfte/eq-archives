    It might be petitionable as harassment. You used to be able to bind
anyone in the arena in The Bazaar, grouped or not, and people that did it
were petitioned for harassment.

    The worst case I ever saw of this was in High Keep. A group was barely
able to keep up with the spawns in Raider, and then they found out that
their bard had been AFK for close to an hour, just playing mana song. So
they bound him there and left.
