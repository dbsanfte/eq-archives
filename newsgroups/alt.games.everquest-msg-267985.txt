But they're not buying and selling the items ingame.  When I "purchase" an 
item with 1k platinum, I'm not "buying" it in a manner that would be legally 
recognized.  Sure, within the context of the game I'm buying and selling, 
but the real world is not the context of the game.  This is only underscored 
by the fact that SOE can decide to nerf items, remove items from the game 
and ban accounts at their discretion.  If I'm in actual legally recognized 
possession of the item in question, they can't do that.

Not sure, and since that's not what they're doing, I don't think that's 
relevant.  I suppose you could look and say that that's what websites 
similar to EQTraders are doing when they have some form of revenue 
(advertising or donations, what have you) and offer message boards that 
allow people to find others who may be buying or selling items they're 
looking for.  If they had commissions for this service, I really don't know, 
but again, this isn't what IGE is doing.

But the intellectual property that comprises platinum in Everquest is more 
than just its visual manifestation, nor is it merely the concept of currency 
within a video game.

There was very specific programming behind Everquest's monetary system to 
get it to work in the manner it does.  That's what the intellectual property 
is.  Said currency system is not the same as, say, WoW's system, or the 
system in Sim games, or single player RPGs, and that's what makes it 
intellectual property.  Simply because there's not a whole lot of creativity 
in having the concept of currency in a computer game doesn't mean that 
individually programmed currency systems are not copyrightable or 
protectable intellectual property.

It seems to me that your position almost is that if I were to completely 
take the programming behind, say Microsoft Word, and use that to create a 
word processor that physically looks nothing at all like MS Word, I haven't 
infringed on Microsoft's copyright of Word.  After all, Microsoft doesn't 
have exclusive use of the concept of word processing, and my creation 
doesn't visually resemble Microsoft's word processor at all.

Depends, are you exploiting Parker Brothers' name and good will?  How are 
you advertising your service?  How might your operation differ from resales 
allowed under the First Sale doctrine?  Not that this has any application to 
what IGE is actually doing.

Except it isn't.  If I buy a whole bunch of Everquest accounts, I'm not 
automatically getting all the items offered within the game, merely the 
opportunity to acquire them through normal gameplay.  To make a really silly 
analogy, it might be comparable to me buying something from said 
organization that would allow me to possess all the railroads at the start 
of any Monopoly game I play.  IGE's transactions affect the gameplay of 
Everquest, and since it's an MMOG, the gameplay of everyone who plays that 
game, not merely those of the people who buy from them.  If I buy another 
wad of $500 bills from some reseller, that doesn't change the way Monopoly 
plays, unless I'm allowed to have them myself at the start of my games.

> Now, the only difference with EQ is that the items are 'virtualized'.
> Does that necessarily change how they should be treated?

I think the nature of EQ's game versus Monopoly does make a difference in 
how they should be treated.  If I sell my brother the Boardwalk card from my 
Monopoly game, for whatever reason, that doesn't have any effect on your 
Monopoly game.  But if I monopolize a spawn in Everquest on your server and 
sell the drops for real life cash, that affects your Everquest game, both 
through the fact that you can't get the drops I'm monopolizing and that you 
have to coexist with all the goofballs who are buying from me.

I'm not familiar with this game, nor am I familiar with why Wizards may or 
may not want to allow that, so I can't discuss this.

How did the WSJ's reputation and good will suffer from the acts listed in 
Carpenter?

That's the thing, it's not something you can tangibly show, but it's not 
hard to say that the reasonable possibility exists, and *that's all they 
need*.

What do you think a person unfamiliar with Everquest would think of EQ upon 
seeing IGE's advertisement on the back of the magazine cited in the first 
post of this thread?  Do you think a negative response is possible?
