Problem is lots of times you have two of the same type of mob so the
target window doesn't tell you anything, except for the health, which
can be useful to see if it's going down... in that case MT is on it.

I also find that mentally it just slows me down a bit to hit "next
npc", stare at the main screen for a moment, and then think "oh yeah,
I can't tell what's targetted, check the target window.

Oh yeah, I'm supposed to yell at you for top posting.  Consider
yourself chastised.
