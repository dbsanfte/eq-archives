People often ask me why I choose to solo in a MMO game. "Why not just play a
single player game?", they ask. The answer is really pretty simple.
Non-linearity.

Any single player game has a certain degree of linearity inherent to it.
That's it's nature. You may have some decisions to make (race/class, etc.),
but the gameplay is story driven. Sometimes that sort of cut-and-dried,
"lead me around by the nose" gameplay is exactly what I want ... that's when
I fire up the Xbox.

But the beauty of a MMO game is that it's non-linear. I get to make choices
... "What do I want to do today?". Do I want to hunt ... do I want to quest
... do I want to tradeskill ... do I want to sit in a newbie garden and buff
folks ... or do I want to do a combination of those things. This sort of
non-linear gameplay isn't really supported on console or single-player PC
games.

Sometimes I want to group, and when I do that option is available to me.
Sometimes the kindest thing I can do is to NOT inflict myself on other
innocent people. Some days, after spending 8+ hours getting fed to the
wolves I just want to bite the wolves back ... alone.
