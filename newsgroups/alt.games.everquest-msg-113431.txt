I had been planning on doing the Dragon Tooth Choker quest from Sentry Kale
in SS.

It involves handing a note to a Giant in Kael. This Giant is a spy, and is
indiff to most folks. BUT the Giants around him (including Noble Hessen)
will aggro on you if you are visible, and he will aggro also.

Handing the note in while invis/camo used to work.

Now I don't know what to do as I don't want to screw up my Coldain or SS
faction.

I imagine there are similar quests that will be much harder to do now.
