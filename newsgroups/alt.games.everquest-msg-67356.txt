Verant does "NOT" promise to keep any characters on an account that is
closed or suspended by the customer.

It has been common for some people to return to EQ after taking
several months off, and find thier characters still there. There must
be more to your story than you are telling us.

Did you really delete your characters when you took your "break"? 

Did you give out your account information to a friend or guildmate
when you took your "break"?  Did this person delete your characters?

I have seen several people give away all their gear and then delete
their characters when they think they are not coming back. I am sure
many of them regret doing it. I am also sure that a few of them have
tried to scam GMs into restoring thier characters. Are you one of
these people?

> the lead GM of bertox replies fast enough "we are unable to restore your characters this matter is now
>closed" i explode i try to complain to the proper channels lead GM
>supervisor intercepts all complaints and tells everyone matter is resolved

The "LEAD" GM made a decision on your case, and that is final. Crying
about it will not change his/her mind. Trying to go around them and
thier decision will get you nowhere. 

By the tone of your rants here I doubt you were very polite or patient
with the GMs involved. The most valuable lesson you should learn from
this is to keep your cool, and use tact when dealing with people
(especially people who hold power over you or something you want).
Stomping your feet and throwing a tantrum doesn't work in the adult
world.
