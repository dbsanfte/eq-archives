They're generally one of the most hated guilds on Rallos, at least by most.

I personally think they're a riot. I think if they had to come up with a
one-sentence motto, it would probably be "You people all take this stupid
game way to f**cking seriously". And they don't take themselves all that
seriously either.

When it comes to PK guilds, I've much more of a problem with Darkenbane than
FoH.
