I take the opposite stance. I love EQ's endgame because it is actually
something that few games dare to be.. educational. You are supposed to
fail.. and fail a lot.. because that is how we learn. We learn through
failure. Blowing through an expansion without failure is just
illustrating that they do not use tactics you do not allready know.
And each time you bang your head against that wall and bust through..
you add another tactic to the raiding arsenal. And when it comes to
high level tactics in raiding.. there are a lot of people that have
gotten pretty fucking good learning off EQ's endgame about what to do
and what not to do.

I'm actually fascinated by what if anything will be in WoW's endgame.
Its something we've heard 0 about. Sure, Afterlife member X says doing
hundreds of quests are doable in WoW!... but really.. what the fuck
are they planning and do they actually have a conception of how
high-end raiding is supposed to work? Unless you've lived that part of
it off a charcter or learned it over 5 years of continuous development
going from a simple hit like Nagafen to something like Quarm and all
things inbetween... its kind of hard to crib.

And my wager is... no matter how stable the WoW enviornment.. if they
go for high-end raid encounters ala EQ, they will face the same issues
EQ has. Its really a catch-22... you need people knowledgable about
high-end raiding to test the encounters... but the people you would
get are also the same ones that would get a leg up from the
information and be sure to pass it along 'on the QT'. So you are left
with either the event being too easy.. or too hard.

Ahh.. like the sewer trials? EQ with GoD tried going both ways for
some progression. Either do the trials or have your guild learn the
raid encounter. And we see how the spoon-fed portion of the userbase
reacted to 1100hp hitters.

And if you setup open mobs with high-end loot for a group or so kill
they'll be insta-dead by those same powerplayers like most of the shit
worth anything old-world, usually from a couple of boxers. LDoN tried
to find a middle and have you build points through missions to go
towards armor. Or on the hard missions be able to get quality loot.
I'm sure any expansion could expand on that concept for higher-level
loot rather readily.

I don't.. it would be like saying if you worked at it 10 years.. you
could suddenly kill your God and anything else you might want to
accomplish on Earth. Most stuff should not be doable by one person or
it would create an unbelievable imbalance of power ala Neo.

And frankly.. I can think of nothing that becomes more boring quicker
than being able to do anything in an MMORPG that you so desire.

Those 3 things were nothing.. and i repeat nothing to the fact that
the IBM compatible was a wide open system for which anybody could
develop. It is what drove the market.. and people and companies put up
with substandard software, buginess and whatever to get it. Its the
one boat that Apple truly and completely missed, they felt their
system would sell itself because it was superior next-generation
bugfree technology. They were wrong, and the market is only the better
for it. IBM, imo, gave the greatest gift ever to the electronics
industry when they first came late to the party with their PC, and in
doing so unknowingly left their system in a position where it could be
hijacked and developed for without concern for their say, input, or
having to provide them royalties.
