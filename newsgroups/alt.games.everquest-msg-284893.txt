Small update:


September 19th, 2006 - UPDATE 
_____________________ 

*** Please Read **** 

Due to issues with granting the extra two character slots to Station
Access subscribers we will be temporarily granting these slots to all
players.  If you are not a Station Access subscriber then these slots
WILL be taken away when the issue is fixed.  Please do not make
characters using these slots unless you are a Station Access
subscriber.

- Fixed issue with AA experience while grouping. 
- Server stability addressed. 
- Non-TSS players will no longer get stuck in the Tutorial. 

We are sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you.  Thank you for
your patience.
