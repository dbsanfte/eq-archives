A blinded mob won't change targets unless its target moves out of melee
range, in which case it'll attack somebody else in melee range, or if it
doesn't hate anybody in range it'll run off in a random direction.  Not
sure what a summoning mob would do tho, and I've never felt free to
experiment, I expect folks would get mighty testy about a wipeout caused
by me experimeting with my spells.
