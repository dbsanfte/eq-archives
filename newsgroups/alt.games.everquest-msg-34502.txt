That brings us neatly to one of my biggest pet hates... People who train
to the Mill in LOIO or to the dock in Oasis, hoping to shake off
whatever is chasing them. HELLO, DUMBASS, PEOPLE MEDITATE HERE, YOU
KNOW?.

Christ, I really hate people who feel help is *owed* to them... I think
it's one of the few ocassions where I have responded to a "Please help"
with a "Please die".
