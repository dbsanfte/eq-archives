Heh.  My point, if I had one, was that 51 seemed about the same as 49.
Once again, I quadded my way through 49 at the Spirocs in Timourious,
so there you go.  :-)

If my druid is in a really good group, I can make more exp per hour in
a group[1].  But good groups are hard to find at 3am, and I get a lot
of reading done in the down time while quadding.

Necros, on the other hand, are pretty much just hampered by the other
5 people in their group.  The only thing that can help a necro is a
druid partner.  Regen + Skelly-form = a LOT of killing.  And if the
druid gets bored, his DoT's stack with necro's so he can lend a hand
that way.

[1] Or so it seems to me.  I haven't bothered to run any kind of log
analysis on it.
