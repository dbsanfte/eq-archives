I think that procs are the issue.  Most of the people posting on this
are post-60, I doubt they see root last for more than a few seconds
when the melees jump on a mob because many (most? all?) melees at that
level have procing weapons and/or buffs that proc, and with DEX gear
and buffs plus haste gear and buffs they're proc'ing pretty often,
especially when multiple melees are on a mob.
