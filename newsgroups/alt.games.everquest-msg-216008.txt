Hmm... On a similar line of thought..... Several of the maps for LDoN
are Incomplete.   Anyone know of a tutorial on how to use the
cartography tool.

I don't intend to map all the walls etc, but would like to do the
start a line here and show where I have gone so far.  But when looking
at the tool I could start a line, but it was a straight line, so Id
have to have the interface up at all times...
Id like to do the old Hanzel and Grettel trick of dropping bread to
find my way back.

thanks for your insight and time..
