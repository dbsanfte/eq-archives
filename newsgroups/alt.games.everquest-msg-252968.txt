SU randomly converts crits to slays, and crits are random to
start with.  It's a feast or famine type ability that's mostly
famine but includes the occasional eye-popping feast.

Parses of SU3 by high-end players (i.e. characters with maxed
stats and all AAs directly relevant to combat) show average
melee damage vs. Undead for an SU3 Paladin increase 15% to 18%,
roughly matching that of an equivalently geared/AA'd Warrior
(i.e. it improves from piss-poor to not very good), so with his
anti-undead proc buff and SU3 a Paladin goes from having the
worst DPS of any melee vs. live mobs to being almost the worst
vs. 10% of the mobs in the game.  HolyForge discipline increases
likelihood of crits, making SU more likely to fire, for five
minutes with a 67 minute reuse delay.
