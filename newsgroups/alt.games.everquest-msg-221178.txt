Actually, at anything past NToV level raiding, no one really needs
special resist gear anyway, the resists on the armor you have has pretty
well all the resists you need unless you made particularly bad choices
of gear from your raiding. Most people in my guild have had maxed
resists with bard song since early elemental days. I'm no where near the
best geared cleric in our guild and all my resists but fire are running
around 250 unbuffed.

They'd have to completely revamp casting mobs yet again for this to be
remotely close to a benefit. I can't remember the last time casting mobs
caused any group I played any of my 40-60's alts the slightest bit of
trouble as opposed to their melee damage. As a trade off to the kind of
agro control knights develop at the high end of the game, it's not even
a factor.
