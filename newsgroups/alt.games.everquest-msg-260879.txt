You've got to.

A guy in our group did a laugh that startled everybody and then showed
us how to do the voices.  We almost didn't manage to finish the LDoN
we were all laughing so hard.  At first we were just doing random
things but the puller started gettng the "follow" and "stop" down, and
then we would all do the "battle" yell when we attacked a mob... it
was great!

Most fun I've had in EQ in a looonnnnnnggggg time.  You'll be digging
out those unused alts just to see what they sound like.
