Yep. Give folks a single charge "Hearth of homecoming" requiring cash, or a
quest , to recharge. Allow people to build little neighbourhoods. Give the
home a vault not connected to the bank network. Make the vault sharable
if you give other folks your hearth key. Allow the hearth to be used to gate
back to your home from *any* city zone. Increase mana dn health regen 3
times when in your home rather than other areas. Allow the door to be locked.
Perhaps even implement the "bazaar" code in residential areas.

It could be kinda neat :)
