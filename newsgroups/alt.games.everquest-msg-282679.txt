in my experiences, melee misses do count toward your defense ... dodge can
be upped too, but riposte only if you are facing the mob (attack does not
need to be on)

what always worked best was being beaten on by lots of mobs - and reds offer
a little more "educational value" for your bleeding hp

druid PL (regen and DS, run into a pack of mobs and just hit each one once
before they die to the DS) worked like a charm (it made your offense skills
suffer when you were powerleveling up)

is it possible (as i thought, possibly mistakenly) that twinked characters
just kill mobs faster and thereby spend less time being whooped and more
time looking for mobs to whoop? when you have that big juicy mace, you only
spend a moment in battle...try a rusty dagger (and a comic book IRL), you'll
have defense maxed by each ding....no?
