You'll still med on horseback while *not* in combat.  This would still
greatly increase efficiency while soloing in areas where soloing goes
like this:

	1. Spend two or three minutes finding a suitable mob.
	2. Spend a minute killing the mob.
	3. Med for 5 minutes.

A horse would give at least a 25% boost in XP/hour there.
