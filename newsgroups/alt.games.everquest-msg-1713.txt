I know your pain. first of get used to healing your pet all the time. do you
have your 24 lvl pet???   also try grouping with other people. i was
grouping with a 28 enchanter and were having no problems and still getting
good xp. There comes a point where it becomes much easier to group with
others.
I have started a cleric which has taken me half the time to get to 24 as my
cleric and have had a good time also. so i dont see myself going back to the
necro .

goodluck
