I would like to see a simple scripting language for socials.

An example for a use of this would be Enchanters mezzing targets.
Right now, an Enchanter typically has a social that says something
like:

/g Mezzing %T.
cast 3

But that doesnt say wether the mezz stuck. With a scripting language,
you could to something like:

cast 3
if(spell stuck)
  /g %T mezzed.
else doagain

or some such.

Aleheart.
