Rather than look at you as a Troll, which I am sure you are. I'll humour
you, because there is a possibility that you are just a child.

Facesmasher is a drop in ToV (Temple of Veeshan)
It is a no drop item so there'll be no buying it or getting given it.
Suggest you get past 55th first before thinking of owning one.

Look to something closer to you're own ability. Gnolls in Black Burrow often
drop Rusty Two Handed swords, for example.

I have this idea that this guy is really from some uber guild and this is
just an act. At the end of it, when he's bored with all this he'll post that
he's really "l33tdewd" of FoH and that he 0wns us all. Well, the intelligent
level seems to fit anyway.
