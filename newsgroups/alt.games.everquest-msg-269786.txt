Which is true for any charmed mob, of course.  Would be too way overpowered
(charm, that is, not druid dire charm in particular) if you could change
zones with charmed mobs.

Charmed mobs zoning will never happen, and for very good reason.

But yes, dire charm typically sucks  now, your limited duration charms
though, are very nice (especially the later ones).
