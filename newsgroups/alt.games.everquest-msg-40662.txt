I dont think there is a definitive answer, it will depend on many things,
such as, are you grouped, and if so how many in group, and also the make up
of classes in your group and what you are fighting will also effect this
decision. There will be times where you can "sit back" and use your
instruments and just play songs, but there are also going to be times where
you will need to get in and gfet dirty and help out with melleeing. So IMHO
you will need to make this call on a case by case basis.
