Woot - SBS which is our multicultural TV station in Australia actually
mentioned last night that there were Indonesian (Balinese) casualties and
injured and even mentioned the fact the fact that they wouldn't have access
to proper medical facilities or future livelihood.

Switch over to the commercial stations and they are just parading Aussies
fresh off the plane:

"It was horrific, I drank too much and was passed out asleep in my hotel
room by 9pm. I basically slept through the whole lot but still feel so
traumatised....."

And people ask me why I rarely watch TV?
