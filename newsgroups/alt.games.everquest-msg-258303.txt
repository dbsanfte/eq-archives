Naw.  It's only the kiddies who are -caught- breaking the laws that want 
to keep their insurance rates low that have to keep going back.  And of 
course, that's independent of whether it was a case of being legally wrong 
even though you were doing the sensible, safe and/or reasonable thing.

Interesting statistic:  I heard somewhere once that only about every 
3,000th traffic violation is actually caught and ticketed.  When I add up 
all the time I save by driving a little faster than the speed of traffic 
rather than the actual speed limit, and divide that into the amount I 
spend on speeding tickets and traffic schools (Which would be, I get 
caught about once every two to three years...) it looks like pretty good 
value for money, to me.

And we can do traffic school online now, woohoo!  Perfect way to pass the 
time during a boring spawn camp. :)
