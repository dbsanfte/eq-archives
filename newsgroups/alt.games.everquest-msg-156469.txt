Ok. I missed the part where he was hitting you for his *max* amount.
There should be a middle ground somewhere for monks between what he
would hit a warrior for and what he would hit a wizard for.

It is still possible to pull him without dying, isn't it? I mean,
could you chain tag with multiple monks, or some other tactic?

I wonder if this will be an issue for a level 65 monk. Was their
intent maybe to make the encounter challenging even to the top level
players?
