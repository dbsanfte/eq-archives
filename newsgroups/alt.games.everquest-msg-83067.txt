    So you're saying you NEED Mighty Strike and low health to get aggro?
What the hell do you do for the rest of the hour while the damn thing
refreshes? Or is the entire hate list thing a red herring? (Hint: one
doesn't get a 60 cleric and 55 rogue without PLing without knowing about the
hate list.)

    Wrong, again. I can name a few clerics on our server (Mlain being the
main one) that simply don't get groups, because they aren't good. Nobody
groups with a moron, no matter how bad they need the XP.

    You're right, I should use Sebilis and its wizard mobs. Or maybe Efreeti
in Sol B and the overpulls. Or just about any zone with the possibility of
wanderers/adds.

    Sure will (unless they 10 K, and I can't help there). It's the climb
back to the top, with mobs beating them senseless, that kills them.

    Must be a terminology problem here. Informally, "melee damage dealers" =
"tanks". And they're pulling so we have more to kill. You could use a
sweeper if you had CC, but you don't always have CC.

    All the people I'm grouped with ARE guilded. So I should join with those

    Yup. But as long as I'm unguilded, I don't get asked to waste my time
spending ten hours helping Timmy get his Foozle Number Five for his epic,
when I could have gotten another alt XP point, or levelled an alt, or had
fun clowning around with RL friends in game. I find wasting time I'll never
get back a LOT worse than having to educate someone on what they might be
doing wrong.

    I love being a cleric. I don't like raids. What part of this are you
missing? Shall I explain how being a melee on a raid is like being an ant,
and how you could turn off autoattack and nobody would know you did it? Or
how otherwise strong classes get shoved into the role of buff whore/support
bitch when it comes time to raid? I don't like the experience of raiding, I
don't like the lootcentric attitude that comes with raiding, I don't like
the heightened competitiveness that comes from raiding, I do not like it.
I'm sorry you can't get that through your thick troll skull - sounds like
the GoZ pounded you one time too many, Mr. Blackheart!

    Yes, I do. Never fight something that requires a heal chain in the first
damn place. That may not work for you - you love the "big mob kill"
experience, and I wish you the best at it. But it works fine for me. Why
would I play a game to be bored, when the "achievement" in it is on the same
level as being the first to solve a new Super Mario Brothers game?

    You may wish to consult it yourself, if you feel that something that
happens as randomly as a crit makes a real difference to your ability to
hold a mob long-term.

    And again, I ask you: so, you NEED Mighty Strike (which is what this was
about, try not to forget that) to taunt effectively in an XP group? You NEED
crits and crips to hold aggro in an XP group? Don't bother mentioning raids,
as if you were actually level 55 and you fired Mighty Strike in a raid
somewhere important your guild leader would tear you a new one for it.

    No, I'm dealing with the typical level of knowledge that permeates EQ.
As I mentioned before in this post, these people I'm grouped with are
guilded. Many are guilded in the "up-and-coming" guilds. Doesn't protect
them from being clueless, since it takes a whole lot of stupidity to screw
up a raid where everyone obeys the few people who DO know what they're
doing. It's apparently quite easy to be an ant. 8)

    Assume "in Velks" means "in Seb". And those two outside spawns are
chumps, compared with the Krups that come from deeper in. Did Seb from 55 to
59, have the T-shirt. (And given my luck on rolls, the T-shirt should read,
"I did Sebilis and all I got was this stupid T-shirt.)

> Tiru constantly

    Nuking in a high-density spawn area is the exact opposite of what one
should be doing, unless the tanks have absolutely horrid damage output.
Puller should have y'all fighting non-stop, with adds parked ready for
killing. Stuns on casters, oh, absolutely. But nukes, especially cleric
nukes? Reckoning is 250 mana - would take close to a minute to med back the
mana from one. Tanks are killing so slow you have that minute to med it
back?

    Sometimes between, rarely during. Sit aggro means not sitting when
there's a lack of control, and time to mem spells means not memming new ones
when folks require attention *now*. And the refill time on our stuns/nukes
is so atrocious that by the time you realize mid-fight you'd need one, mem
it, and get to use it the situation has past. When played to the limit, a
good cleric has the spells up before the encounter. <sarcasm> Perhaps I
could give you the web site address of a good cleric site, so you could read
up on it?</sarcasm>

> Most have hot keys for it.

    For swapping spells? No can do - there is no "mem spell" macro. Best you
can do is a macro with, say, /book X, where you know page X has spells of
type Y. With good book management, all your spells will be within a few
pages anyways (we really don't have a lot of spells that one would swap in
suddenly, or which aren't superceded by other spells).

    That's typical. Especially in areas where single pulls are easy to get.

    Hmm, so now keeping a tank at above low health so they don't die on the
pull is "playing the class poorly". Amazing. Glad to see that all that time
you have on Jakugg has made you an EQ expert. I just wish I'd learned
something in those 100 days /played on Delores.

    As well you should. It's the one thing that's made your class what it is

    Good luck - I'll be pulling for you! (Well, maybe not - do you let
clerics pull?)

> And I know

> etc.

    Oh, you "know" that, do you? So let me get this straight - when you're,
say, pulling the Gangrenous PH and friends, which come all at once, which is
the better plan:

1) You pull and pop Defensive, tank 'em all. Cleric has to heal you less, so
can either spend time assisting the crowd controller (if they need it) or
BEING a crowd controller. Ideally, cleric uses so little mana that you can
move right into the camp without any delay once the crowd is dead.
2) You pull and hold onto your precious /disc like the gold it is. Cleric
has to heal you more, and must therefore spend more time casting heals on
you and less time aiding others. Cleric also builds more aggro, forcing you
to work harder on the break for mez/root. Depending on how bad it is, a
small med break may even be required, causing your mob spacing over time to
be uneven and FORCING you into a less efficient pull pattern.

    And that's all assuming that your ability to handle the Gangrenous pull
isn't an issue. Insert any situation where pulling three plus mobs, like
breaking the scarabs in Necrosis/Guardian, here.

>  If you find yourself in a situation where your tank "suddenly"
> needs defensive and doesn't have it, you didn't plan very well.

    If my tank blows Mighty Strike, remind me again how long he feels he
won't need Defensive for? I'm just a cleric, I don't have access to the
warrior sites you do.

    And you deal absolutely cruddy damage compared to Orlun, or an average
monk, or even some of the other people you group with. Do you think that by
popping Mighty Strike you've massively increased the group's damage output,
when you're one of three or four damage dealers? DOUBLE your total damage
output and you're only increasing GROUP damage output by between a quarter
and a third, assuming you hold your own as a percent of the group. So one
mob falls in three quarters the time, at best? Wow, must have been a real
unplanned emergency for that to have been required. You must not have
planned very well. Or, you fired it off to show off what a big series of
numbers you could make spam across everyone's screen. As an aside, I'm
wondering with all the alt. XP skills revolving around crits if we won't get
a Crit filter so we can ignore them like we can all the other spam.

    From the same warrior that judged my healing, and the guild status of
the people I see in groups based on what he sees on Xev. I'll call this one
even if you will. 8)

    Again, double standard. I, the defensive support class, get told to
always have enough mana to do my job, and I do it because it's the right
thing to do. You, the defensive melee class, get told that blowing Mighty
Strike is a waste, to save a defensive /disc for when you need it - and you
fight that. "I shouldn't need it, I want to have fun, what kind of sucky
cleric are you...." Can you not admit that hey, maybe the person who knows
about damage taken might know something here?

> Sorry it's sucked so much for you.

    Again, it doesn't suck for me. I tell the tanks "no berserking", they
comply (like they have a choice, as the stripper found out), we get on with
the XP. Everyone forgets about it, and we start gossiping/chatting again.
It's really quite fun!

    My rogue has just such a hunting arrangement with a small, non-raid
guild. As a non-guild member, I don't have to go on any of their raids, but
I do go XP with them - which for me is ideal. I've been thinking about
setting up a similar arrangement with Delores - same people all the time, go
do XP stuff - but I think it would get too formal. The whole idea for me is
log on, see who else happens to be on, go play the character that plays with
them. If nobody is on, pick a character and get a pick-up group/solo. Having
an "arrangement" more formal than my rogue's would give me obligations, and
that's the LAST thing I want in a game that I use to relax.

> > Especially when your "options" make you a WORSE tank?

    Nope, my warrior is only level 45. However, my time as a HEALER for
warriors in the "high end" likely dwarfs the entire time you've spent
playing EQ, including your time on your necromancer and your time in
"retirement". I certainly remember giving you equipment advice from when you
first started - remember your "I don't see how Plat or Velium Fire Wedding
Rings would help that much" comments? 8)

    Again, with gusto: do you really think your ability to taunt as a
warrior REQUIRES crits, crips, low health, or the use of the Mighty Strike
discipline? If you do, and I can't believe you do, then I maintain you are
the one who is absolutely clueless on how taunt works and advise you to
re-read all those warrior pages you keep referring to. As for raid tanking,
you are right - I know a good deal about how the initial engagement works
for a MA, but not much about how a tank transition is done smoothly. Now if
only that had anything to do with what we were talking about, huh?

    The point is you have done things that weren't maximally efficient, or
even close to it, just so one person could have a blast (no pun intended)
that day. That's what the cleric is doing when they let you fire off Mighty
Strike - letting you have fun. It doesn't make your group better (saving
/disc usage for an emergency, or planning it for efficiency on the "weakest
link" - the healer's mana - would be better), but it makes you happy. It's
nice to see you thought about the other folks in the party, and tried to do
something that would be fun for them.

    Thank you for trying to turn an attempt at levity into an opportunity to
spout the obvious. And, like so much else in this thread, you're wrong
depending on the situation. Take the example I won't let die, Velk's. If I'm
in the dog camp or upper spiders/Frenzied/whateverit'scalledonXev, I don't
want Gate. I want DA and DB. For spiders, if a castle train hits my best
chance of living is to DA and jump. If a castle train comes bounding through
the upper dog camp, I can be better off hitting DA, backing off, and camping
out to res folks back in - that's how my buddy Field always does it (I have
yet to see a castle train in Upper Dogs - lucky at spawns, unlucky at
rolls). Even in Sebilis, depending on where you are you might want DA over
Gate - like in Nec Guard, where the portal is a short ways away, or in Nec
Jail (the camp with the Iksar Necromancers).

    Nor did I try to, Mr. Crankypants. Perhaps it's just "cleric humour",
but whenever someone says they're going to do something very risky in group
my response is "memming res". And she's not indulging you to be a worse
tank, she's indulging you to be a risk taker. "Hey, there's a big lizard in
a zone with no zone lines, Aliezesomething, let's go kill it!" "Guardian of
Zek? What the hell, bring that SOB to the CAGE!" She follows you no matter
what you want to do, because she loves you and because it could be fun - but
she mems res and gate, too. 8) It's good that you take risks - you learn a
lot that way.

    You'd be the first, then. And I'm serious there. I have yet to be
bounced from a group for any reason, even with multiple clerics at zone LFG
(and that happens a LOT more than you'd imagine). I DO get people sneaking
me up their group lists for camps like Frenzied in Velk's because they like
me, though.

    Or perhaps because I'm a good cleric, who knows what to do and when to
do it. And most warriors aren't quite as obsessed with being able to fire
off Mighty Strike as you are, and let it go. The impression of being
popular? Heh, you must have the combined mental powers of Madame Cleo and
Carnac the Magnificent to be able to project "you are hated" from "I won't
let warriors fire off one /disc".

> And finding a cleric for

    Must be a Xev thing. Plenty of twinks and mains on our server - trust
me, I get to count them all when I zone into an area and figure out if I can
get a group or not. Not many stick with it, but so long as people promote
clerics with lines like "you get ALL the cash items, it's so unfair!" and
"you ALWAYS get groups, clerics are as rare as hen's teeth!" you'll always
have more.

> So I suppose the
> unhappy bastards forced to go LFG all the time

    Most of the people on my server, BTW. Guild groups are only popular with
folks doing quests and with the top two guilds, who do some pretty
high-power stuff in XP groups. The rest are always filling holes with people
from other guilds, or forced to go it alone. People just don't keep the same
schedules.

    Yeah, that "don't use Mighty Strike" is quite the burden. It must drive
them bonkers! Oh, wait - it's just you.

> I can tell you that attitude wouldn't last long in a guild where

    I don't even know where to start with this one. My three highest level
characters are Delores, Rosy, and Mandy Mulva. 60 cleric, 55 rogue, 45
warrior. All dwarf women, all with the same last name. I've never pretended
that they're anything but MY characters. Yet, somehow, these three
group-dependent classes have all managed to get to high level. Do you really
think that's because I'm a disagreeable person that's managed to get lucky?
Do you think I get asked to join folks on the regular basis that I do
because they require a rogue, or a warrior, or a cleric, and not because I'm
a good person to group with? Or get asked to join guilds with lines like
"you know, we really do like you :-)"? Or is it just easier for you to
assume that if someone does something that would piss YOU off, that they
must be evil people that have no clue about how YOUR class works and must be
hated by everyone?

    And good luck on your Tormax raid. If all your warriors are firing off
Mighty Strike, you'll need it. 8)
