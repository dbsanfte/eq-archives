The other thing to add here, is unless it was changed again, they did not
remove the 200 cap, they just changed it so that wisdom over 200 is better
than it was before.  Each point of wisdom over 200 still does not give you
as much mana as each point up to 200, but it does give you more than before
the cap was modified.  Of course, it's possible they changed it again, and I
am completely wrong here.  As far as the WIS vs AC, I think that was pretty
well summed up already, and applies to WIS below and above 200.
