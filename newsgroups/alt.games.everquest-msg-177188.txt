About the same. There's not a lot going on. However there's a RP preferred
server where things are somewhat better. You still get the d00ds who whine
"It's only a RP *Preferred* server" but it's not too bad.

With a lot more zones in the game people are a bit more spread out. There's
not so much competition for spawn so in that was things have relaxed a bit I
think.

15 minutes? Well maybe. If you get all the expansion you'll have Planes of
Power which has a very nice portal system for moving quickly from place to
place. Still 15 minutes isn't a lot of time.

Better. Most of the really high-levels have moved off to the Planes of
Power.

With the bazaar that's not as common as it was. There's lots and lots of
decent gear on the market and prices are fairly reasonable.

Can't speak to that. Disasters happen.

Well, hell levels are gone, but it still sucks to die.
