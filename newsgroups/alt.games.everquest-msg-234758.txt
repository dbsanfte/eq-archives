It's possible to play a bard and not twist songs.  It is not possible to be
a *good* bard - nay, it isn't possible to be a *COMPETENT* bard - and not
twist songs.

There is much more to bardwork than twisting - but generally, if you can't
twist at least three songs during battle, you will be considered a suck
bard.  Your solo ability is nonexistent; you'll seldom if ever group with
anyone more than once unless they owe you money.

Nobody's asking you to twist during downtime.  If, however, you can't twist
during a fight, you'll never even reach adequate - mediocre is the best you
can hope for.

Do I sound vehement?  Probably.  But I've grouped with a bard who went
autofollow, turned on manasong, and went AFK for fifteen minutes - we
disbanded and replaced him after five, and left him following the group
around singing to himself.  I know he was AFK for fifteen minutes when he
started shouting to the zone how unfair we were to disband him.

Last night, I had my bard in an LDON with a cleric, two warriors, a rogue
and a wizard.  I was group puller/ crowd control/ haste/ slow/ mana regen/
damage shield (23 points)/ resist buff/ trap detect & disarm /disease &
poison curer, and I did it all, and I did it well, dinged 58 and we won the
adventure.  I consider myself a competent bard, no more; yet I was able to
fill ALL of the roles that our group was missing, and if I'd been a one-note
slacker we never could have done it.

Raivenn Lunatic,
58 bard
