I don't know if its an actual statistic or not, but as a wise man once said,
"There are three kinds of lies in this world.  Lies, damn lies and
statistics."

I'd actually tend to believe it, but as you said, it would take a lot of
conditions to get you there.  It likely includes all corporations that filed
a tax return, including "no activity" returns.   It likely defines zero tax
as "no corporate income tax" and ignores FICA, allowing it to include every
small corporation where the owners bonus out the income as salary at the end
of the year (they then pay personal income tax on it in addition to
employment taxes.).

And I'm sure there's a good reason why they chose only "last year" rather
than looking at a span of years.   Aside from it being a bad year
economically in general, in which a lot of companies posted losses (paying
no tax for that one year), one of Bush's tax cuts, the increase in Sec 179
depreciation, allowed all small companies even more help in zeroing out
income by letting them to immediately expense up to $100,000 of new
equipment purchases, rather than depreciating it. (Limit was supposed to be
$25,000 for the year.)  This is only a temporary advance though, as while it
lowers the current year income, it increases the income for the next five to
seven years since the company does not get their normal depreciation
deduction on those assets.

Hell, I wouldn't be surprised to hear they included "S" corporations in
their count as well.  S-corps are _supposed_ to pay no corporate tax.
That's the whole idea of them.   All income from them is instead included on
the personal tax returns of the individual owners in proportion to their
ownership percentage.  Really a partnership in corporation's clothing.
