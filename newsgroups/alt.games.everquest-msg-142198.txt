I've no problem with that scenario, so long as you don't ask or expect
the artist to share her efforts with you.

Irrelevant. In this scenario, you have taken something without paying
for it. That you wouldn't have bought it doesn't change the fact that
you now have it and the owner wasn't compensated.

Further, the situation you're suggesting isn't universal. People do
steal copyrighted works rather than buy them.

Of course you have. Who hasn't?    /sarcasm

Also irrelevant. Putting more money into the pocket of one artist
doesn't give you carte blanche to take something from another without
paying.

Are you and hughes sharing a brain?
