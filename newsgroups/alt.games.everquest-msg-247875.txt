Sure, and hunting in Paludal Caverns will give you zero AAXP.  It is 
easier to gain AAXP at higher levels.  The reason being you can kill 
higher level mobs, which each yield more XP than the one you can 
generally kill at lower levels.

I had a BL friend who loved to solo in there too.  I prefer hitting BoT 
or Tactics for soloing and grouping for that matter.
