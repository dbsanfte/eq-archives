But as I said, a lot of users have them installed but don't really know much
about them or how they work. Someone probably told them that it would be a
good idea to get one as they stop hackers. I use ZA Pro 3 in conjunction with
BlackICE. I don't actually use the BlackICE "firewall", such as it is, but
only as an IDS. I also have Trojan Trap running in the background. If
something gets through that lot then there really isn't a lot I can do about
it.
