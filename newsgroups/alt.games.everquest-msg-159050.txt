Yes he can drop 2 weapons at once.   He only shows 1 in his hand though.

Why would warriors get first dibs on the trinket?  End-game 41% haste is so
much more easier to get for hybrids (and warriors after them, at least in my
guild) because of GoDs.  Obviously monks are ruled out for GoDs.. so imo
trinket = monk loot

The rampage order never changes.. how were you getting so many people being
rampaged? (I assume people on rampage were running out, but thats kinda
inefficient on heals)

Also, have you guys killed Arch Lich?
