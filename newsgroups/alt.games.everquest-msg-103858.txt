At first I didn't mind the post verant made about rate increases , but I
sure do now ! In the two days I've seen several bugs that would cost players
lose of exp due to deaths. You'd think after 3 years and better verant would
have fixed these friggin bugs ! Noooo ! instead of making EQ a better bug
free game , they boost our rates ! Is good help that hard to find that
verant needs to hose their clients ?
