No, that is where they changed the full group bonus.  Prior to that 
change, adding a 6th person actually reduced the xp per person that each 
group member got, with that change, they increased the xp per person for 
a 6 man group over what it used to be, thus, effectively increasing the 
full group bonus.  This patch increased the bonus given for groups in 
general, of any size, but increased the bonus for a full group the most.

The word is "cite" btw.
