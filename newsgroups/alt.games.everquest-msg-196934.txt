Ok Ed, as you apparently do not understand why I characterize your
"question" as a "whiny complaint", I will explain.  Let us examine
the above post, the first I responded to in this thread.

First clue:  "Yes, but..."
You start with _the_ classic whine opener.  Not an auspicious beginning.

Second clue:  "Why not ..."
At this point you had such a stereotypical whine going that I expected
a caricature, you know, some real humor inresponse to Sean's post.
Sadly, it was not to be.

/aside
Please note that your "Why not let bards..." bit here is what I was
referring to when I characterized your whining genericly as "Why
doesn't SOE do things the way I think they should?".  See?  There it
is, in black and white, posted by none other than Ed Jensen.
/aside

And finally, at the heart of any self-righteous whine, the leading
question designed to get the listener to think badly of whatever or
whoever is being whined against, thereby giving "victory" to the
whiner, or so the whiner hopes:
"Why does SOE want to give their customers Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?"
Not only does your post whine, it does so in such classic form that
I'd be very surprise to learn that you actually gave it any conscious
thought, it practicly shrieks of thoughtless knee-jerk laziness.

While we're here, lets look a little closer at your little leap of
illogic there.  First, it has not been demonstrated that SOE has
ever "given" a single customer "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome".  Given the
facts that (1) playing EQ is a completely voluntary leisure activity,
(2) playing a Bard character is a completely voluntary choice within
that already voluntary context, and (3) "twisting" is in no way
required of Bard players by SOE, it seems pretty safe to say that
that your implied claim is utterly bogus.  On that basis, Ed, I find
myself led inexorably to the conclusion that you are every bit the
ass you mistakenly believe me to be.
