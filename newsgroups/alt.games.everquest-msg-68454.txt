It's a handicap in that it makes it impossible to
figure out when you might want to port down to
Norrath in order to catch an event that's on a day/night
cycle.

For example, if you wanted to go to High Pass via
a port to WC and a run through Kith, it'd be nice to
know whether you were going to have to wait another
20 minutes for daylight after you arrived.  If so,
you could stick around Luclin and do something useful
for another 20 before you ported.

Likewise for checking certain spawns that only appeared
at night or during the day, etc.

Why is an additional player handicap not a "nerf"
in your opinion?
