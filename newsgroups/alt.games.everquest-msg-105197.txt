I chose not to go for a new one at this time. I believe that I'll have
to petition if/when I want a new one, rather than just being able to go
through the filter, since a GM removed it. However, since no mark was
put on my record saying "Bad Wizzie! No surname fer ju!!" it shouldn't
be a problem.

I had one in mind, but didn't want to rush into it. My favorite cocktail
when drinking is Jack & Coke. (Jack Daniels and cola of your choice.
Yes, yes, I know, I'm ruining perfectly good sipping whiskey. Whatever.)
So for a full name, I thought of going for "Jakiss Encokiss". Not sure
if they would see through that and squash it, though. Heh.
