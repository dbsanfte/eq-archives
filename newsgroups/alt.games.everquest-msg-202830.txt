Fine but KEI is a massive overkill - there are bunch of low level mana
regen spells that are pretty fine that people seem to have forgotten about
- Breeze, clarity at the right point and the cleric ones all reduce
downtime to more than acceptable levels yet because the big uber one isnt
there the others are treated as not good enough...the only group of people
I can understand as really really wnat to push the KEI boat are those who
are incredibly experienced and have no interest in the lvl 1-40 game, but
I dont think they should run the game for others and frankly they will
have enough friends with enough buffs and PL ability that they have an
alternate rute to fast levellin g anyway so KEI loss isnt taking anything
from them - not to mention the above alternative lower level spells
