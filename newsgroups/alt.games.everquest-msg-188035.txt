Anyone have any info on the spawn timer for Donally (mob near the Qeynos
docks used for the first Qeynos badge quest). I've been checking on him for
days, and have evern camped him several hours - I have yet to find him up.

Is this quest potentially broken or perhaps changed in a what that isn't on
any of the sites? The Investigator still indicates that Donally is down by
the beggar named "Rat", so I think the quest is still intact.
