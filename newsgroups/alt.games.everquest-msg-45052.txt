A question ... what makes the Langseax beeter than the Giant Militia
Longsword?  I know the delay on the GMLS is in the 30's, but it hits for
almost twice the damage of the Langseax.  Both are magic, though neither
procs anything, and both can be found in the 20's (I picked up my GMLS in
East Commons for 20 plat).

My lvl 15 Warrior is running with the GMLS in the primary hand and a Walrus
Tooth in the off hand.  Seems to be working okay for now. :-)
