See below for why both are still viable.

Actually I heard it was the same exp that it takes from 50 to 51?  Can't
remember exactly now but I think that is it.  Second thing to point out is
each skill will not necessarily cost one point.  And indeed, it would be
logical to think that for the quick evac one it would cost one point for the
10% reduction in time, another for the 25%, then another for the 50%.  So
the no mana insta cast one quite possibly will cost several exp points.
What this means is you can spend points on getting a lot of small upgrades
or save up to get a bigger yet more specialised one.
