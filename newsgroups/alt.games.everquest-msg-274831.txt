Well, we agree that I want to sign on and have fun.  If there is
someone who is so bored with life that he's signing on to a game even
though he isn't having fun, he needs to find something else to do.

By the way, I would include walking around exploring zones that I
haven't seen before in the "fun" part of the game.   I don't need to
be killing, leveling, getting loot or getting experience to be having
fun.  The first time I explored Velks with some guildies was fun even
though we "accomplished" almost nothing.

I've also run marathons for fun so I don't think I'm quite as into
"instant gratification" as you seem to think.
