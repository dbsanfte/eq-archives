Damn, I feel so useless now.  Nobody asks me for a bind anymore.  Get a clue
Ed, it's a blessing for us binding classes to no longer be bothered for a
bind as much as we used to be.  As for ports, well, I still pay for just as
many ports as I did pre Luclin, which is to say very few.  If I have to get
somewhere fast for some reason, I will pay for a port.
