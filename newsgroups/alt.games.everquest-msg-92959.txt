Well, now that my ES Vambraces have come online, I've developed a 
quad-rooting technique. Just ensnare a bunch of mobs, root them, and dot 
them with the Vambraces. Re-apply root as necessary. Works for me, and 
it's less stressful than quad-kiting.

As for the casters... normally I avoid them like the plague, but 
sometimes something like the Heretic heads quest in Stonebrunt comes up, 
and I need to kick some caster butt.
