Can't you pull up the spell book, and turn off meditate?  It seems to me
that you can press the meditate button, and stop meditating.  I have never
tried this, I don't quite see what the point would be.  If so, then, does
the button setting carry over to when you are just sitting without looking
at the spell book?  OK, so this would be useless trivia, but I am just
curious.
