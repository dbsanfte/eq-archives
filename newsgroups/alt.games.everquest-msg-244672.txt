    Well, in fact *NOT* all guilds that regularly raid seem to fit the
common perception of a "raiding" guild that folks have here!

    My guild schedules two raids a week, an expects no huge levels of
committment. We get high turnouts - for us - on raids anyway, because
raiding is actually fun if you don't make a career out of it. Nobody would
notice if you closed off your guild chat to do a LDoN, and the idea that
people would abandon a pickup group in need of their help to do anything -
well I find that offensive, personally, and I imagine that's the shared
view.

    Before people ask, we usually get around 30 60-65's these days to a
typical raid, and are slowly and comfortably working our way through
luclin - recently begun taking out THO and the Burrower.

Cheers,
James
