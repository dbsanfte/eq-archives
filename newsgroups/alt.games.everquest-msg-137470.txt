Bah... im gettiung annoyed having to re-design the screen every time I log a
diff char in, or use a different computer for the char.. having to do it all
again if I use a skin doesn't thrill me..

Don't you remember the fix for shrink/wolf form, when it actually made your
view perspective change to your new height?.. Well FD is lower than these,
but all day in Kael when pressing FD i wasn't getting a single height/angle
change.. meaning I've gotta look at the screen to see if it was pressed or
not (or one of those "cannot do a command at this message" things)

ya track, inventory, item, bazaar.. all of it.   I don't like using the
mouse so wanna see this fixed

What did you find?  I haven't seen anything that looked remotely good yet

i never used hitsmode..  wasn't it just "my hits" in a seperate box?
like...

hit for 10
punch for 90
hit for 79
kick or 165
hit for 45
hit for 79
hit for 102

I never saw the point of that...   seeing a screen of hits in 1 box, a
screen of mob hits in the main window? and no correlation between the 2..
maybe i was just missing something.

What did hitsmode have that the new UI doesn't?   All I wanted was melee
combat (hitting and being hit in a box outside of the chat window)  and
thats what I've got.

Some parts of it are annoying..  exp messages, faction messages, enrage,
some spells.. they don't go into the same box - you have to look in both to
see the various messages.. now thats annoying

Don't move the mouse over a particular buff, just hold down the alt key with
the mouse in the play area, and it will show all buff names

Well you have ports done...  put SoW in a good place too, and I'd say your
spell book is finished :)
