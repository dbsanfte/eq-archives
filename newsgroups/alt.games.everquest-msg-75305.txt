All around level 12, doing the yellow to red mobs in Loda Kai
cave... like a meatgrinder.  No down time except that we got
our patterns down better and ended up as you say running out
of mobs to kill.

Thats 10 melee, one guy one healing, one guy medding... pets
engaged all the time, and when each BL would run OOM he'd
sit, the one medding would stand up (even though not fully FM)
and the next BL in lineup would become healer.

This lineup would be even better at 15+ with some of the improved
buffs, and better still at 22+ when slow finally shows up.

========================================
Cleric Cleric Cleric Monk

on the vampire at the tower in TM.  Sure, we'd started out
with a more conventional group, and eventually recruited
others.. but the wierd point in the cycle was this grouping.

Monk would single pull out to us, then tank it up.  One slap
of Divine Light to put him back in business, and then nothing
but Donal click Valors to keep him alive.  On the big boys,
my buddy would Epitaph, I'd UHOF, and the third cleric would
hold back, then when at around 2/3rd dead, he'd Banish Undead
while the two of us would both sling stuns.  Needless to say this
also involved a fair mana expenditure on heals, but since we were
able to chop down the little guys with just monk plus one cleric,
we were able to med back up in time to keep the lower floor clear,
which means General and Named each cycle for potential drops.

Adds were also a bit of a mana sink, particularly the sonic wolves,
which are (first time I've seen one of these messages) "Immune
to Fear"... bats we'd send away till the main target was dead
but the SW actually had to be dealt with... more than once a couple
of these turned into "run to zone" which is why we were more than
happy to get a ranger in.
