I do not know French.  I do know that Georg told you that your name DOES
violate the naming policy, and I do know that you did not dispute that, so
you admit that your name violates the rules.

Perhaps those first 3 GMs don't speak French and the 4th one does.

Just because the last 3 policemen let me off with a warning for driving 90
in a 55 zone does not make the 4th one incorrect for giving me a ticket.

But yes, I agree, the GM should have told you that your name violated it -
as you know - because of that title.
