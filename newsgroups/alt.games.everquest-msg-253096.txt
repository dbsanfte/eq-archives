If you actually call and talk to the people who do the transfers and tell
them what's going on with the accounts, they will transfer chars if the
details don't match.  On the screen where you request the transfer, there is
even a place at the bottom marked for it (something like: "Please give
details if account information does not match").  I got my friend into
everquest about a year ago, but before that I let him create a character on
my second account.  It got to the point where I couldn't ever use my second
account cause he was, so he got his own account.. the got a second one (I
really got him hooked).  Well, he still had that original char on my account
(46 druid I think it was, at the time, he's 56 now).  So I explained this to
sony ( emphasising the fact that I got this person to give them over $25
bucks a month), and the guy who did the transfers went ahead and did it.. it
took under 5 minutes once I got through to the right person.  Btw, I did get
a rejection letter from them because the account details were wrong, but
then I had the info in the system when I made the call.

Anyways, the point of all that is that they will do transfers if you
convince them you aren't buying the characters and such.
