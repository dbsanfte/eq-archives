I really did enjoy that game, and I'm pretty sure it's the reason I was
drawn to EQ in the first place. There were a lot of concepts that I would
like to have seen carry over to EQ, for example, having your "fashion"
wardrobe separate from your armor choices, so you could look the way you
wanted regardless of the type of armor you owned.

There was supposed to be a third installment in the Elder Scrolls series,
but I never saw it. Did it even get published?
