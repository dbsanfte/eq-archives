Snip

You are comparing something very illegal, to something not illegal at
all. There is nothing illegal about selling virtual items in a game.
No court of law has yet made the decision that it is illegal, since it
is very unlikely that they would win. SOE or anyone certainly could
afford to take such people to court, so the only reason they don't
MUST be because they know they might lose. If they lost, then the
problem would escalate since the only thing keeping many users from
doing it is a false morality.

So this is an invalid comparison. You might want to compare it to
something legal, but slightly shadey instead. For example, selling
plasma for 30 bucks in a pinch could be an ok comparison. Its not
really "donating" blood, but its certainly legal.
