Unless it's a newly introduced item, there's no such thing as a sarnak
ring of station at least none have been reported to drop in the past
year or so since Kunark's been out across all the servers.

I think you can safely assume the guy meant the sarnak earring of
station.

But you're right 10k is a retarded value.
Closer to 1k at most.  Assuming folks even bother selling "looting
rights" for something that's gonna poof in 5 mins.
