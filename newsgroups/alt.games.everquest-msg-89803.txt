I am interested in finally getting off my ass and picking up the Crown
of the Frogloc King for my raid kit. (which I should have done ages
ago.) Never actually fought on that side of LGuk nor seen his area, what
guards him, etc. Assuming I can find the camp open, how many mid fifties
will it take to do this guy? Assuming Tiru and I (both 54
cleric/warrior) how much of a brute squad do I need to take with me for
this camp?

We've camped the Ghoul Archmage by ourselves, but but that's sort of
different I guess.
