Was wondering and yes, like me you are a druid ;)

Sad to say, but since as druids we have VERY few choices of loot, at
55 mine is probably wearing a lot of the same things your 35 is, or up
until recently and some odd drops in kael and the coldain boot and
glove quests I was. We don't get quest armor like the other classes or
as many other choices even since limited to leather so you end up with
not very much to keep you interested as a druid from like level 35 -
50 when you are in the planes and THINK you will get some planes
armor. Soon you find out that verm, especially the key pieces is like
non existant in tons and tons o' raids. Soon you find that even the
thurg quest stuff does not drop it kael much, really you have no
chance for good new stuff until you get to ToV.

Like you as a druid you can reach many of the goals early. Since I had
a lack of Equip to get really as a druid I even reached the other goal
I had and now at 199 wisdom as a wood elf druid I also have 80 mr 120
cr and 110 FR, ALL the time. I still have a couple more res items I
put on for raids, like the BD tiara. I'll have even higher wis/mana
and higher resistences if I ever get a skyshrine quest tunic and legs
via tov, helm would be nice too.

Those 3 things are pretty easily realized really, even at your level
without much help. Crystalline belt is VERY nice for a druid and not
really too awful hard to get. As a 55 druid I went without any wis
belt forever and finally got the Howling stones 6 wis one from a
friend, which finally made me feel I did not really need the reed
belt. Crystalline is darn nice though and I wish it was around when I
was level 35.

Really quad kiting is not that great from my experience. Lower level I
thought it was better to root and dot and sit.  Most areas don't seem
that good to quad in at lower levels without getting adds.

And that gynok guy. I tried again when they changed the quest, but
nah, not worth my time. I got a book of rings instead in droga and was
more than satisfied.

Welcome to druid land, there is a lot you can do but not a lot to get
or to keep you doing it. I don't know, I did not feel they way you
feel really until I was like level 50 and STILL not getting armor in
the planes (not for lack of opportunity either.. the stuff just is
stingy dropping) while eventually watching sks, bards and clerics get
their first armor sets VERY fast then with the addition of Velious
their POG armor set VERY fast. Sad to see everyone else in their full
second set when you've only got verm arms (which you no longer wear
even really),  and one bracer. The kromriff military legs quest kind
of filled the hole nicely, being better than or equal to the verm legs
(and later I got giant something or whatever legs from kael which are
even better.. and the arms too, as drops) but I'm running around in a
shroud of nature still and kinda feeling goofy ;)

Maybe you should try a cleric, you might eventually switch. They get
to be the belle of the ball, always wanted for groups, always having
excitement, lots of friends, etc. They also get a quest set of armor
which is sold a lot even if they don't feel like getting themselves,
FAR more armor choices than druids have, and eventually knowing that
they will be covered in purplecite soon after getting into the planes,
gold if their guild does POG and then just have Kael or skyshrine
quest armor as the last things in ToV. 

I got a dark elf cleric to 37 so far and am having a blast. Druid is a
good farming and getting around character but when 99 percent of it
becomes for stuff you give to others, your twinks, or sell but none
you can use yourself it gets pretty old.
