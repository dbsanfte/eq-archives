A) Get it right, you lost credibility, Voodoo isn't or never was a
company. 3DFX was. The reason they support it is that many people
still use and run 3dfx cards. I for one, and find that it plays the
game quite well. And with 4x Anti it looks beautiful. Why not
support the card? What does it matter to you if they do or don't
anyway? Plus there is glide which makes the card even faster for some 
people. Both the Hercules and Guillemot cards are supported through
DirectX....so what exactly are trying to state here?
