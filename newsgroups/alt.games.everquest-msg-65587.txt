I finally got a cable modem set up and am now looking at sharing the
connection with 2 other PCs.  I was looking at the SMC 4 port router.
It has NAT and DHCP on both the WAN and localnetwork side.  My concern
is though does this work with EQ now that I'm hooked after two weeks
of playing.  Wife wants to KoS me, no faction with her.  Does anyone
have experience with this hardware?  It looks like it would do the job
but hoping for a testimonial or two before plunking some more money
down.  I don't want to replace the cable modem I just got, to get a
router/modem combo.  I prefer not to tie up another PC to work as a
NAT router function.

Post response or email me.  Thanks in advance.  Happy hunting.
