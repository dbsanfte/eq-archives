Well, if we are going to come at this logically, I did not call you an
idiot. My specific words above indicate that it is the idiots that
play mmorpgs that will drive me to quit, not that everyone who plays
them is an idiot. Therefore your inference was flawed from the
beginning. Since your final conclusion is based on a flawed inference,
it, too, is flawed, via fruit of the poisoned limb.

That is all.
