They are not on the old spell list I had handy, pre PoP.

Damn nice spells, I'd have to agree.  Definately better than other hybrids 
in the spell damage department.

At level 61, Mages go up to a 4:1 ratio.  Wizards go to an even higher 
ratio.

Silly me I editted out the comments on how little I know about BLs, and 
that I was using an old spell list.

Sounds like some balancing may be in order.  :p
