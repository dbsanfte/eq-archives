The following are all individual 3-ring binders... mostly printed off from
Allakhazams, EQAtlas and EQTraders, with additional handwritten notes...

Antonica Maps Vol #1 (Befallen to Nektulos Forest)
Antonica Maps Vol #2 (North Ro to West Karana)
Faydwer and Odus Maps
Olde Worlde Cities
Kunark Maps
Velious Maps
Luclin Maps

Smithing (including Cultural) *Needs revising
Tailoring (including Cultural) *Also needs revising
Tradeskills III (Fletching, Brewing, Baking, Pottery)
Epic Walkthroughs and Class Specific Armour Quests (stuff like Crafted, Ivy
Etched and Totemic)

Folders as yet empty, but labled and ready for use...
Tradeskills IV (Poison, Tinkeing, Alchemy and Jewelcraft)
Planes Atlas (if I ever get a char past 45)
Newbie Armour quests (dunno if I'll fill this, tho it'd be a funny account
to sell on Ebay... all race/class/deity combos played to a min of lvl 20)

11 binders in use... 3 more waiting... a shelf full :o)
