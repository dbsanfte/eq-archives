Well, thanks for the perspective so many have offered.  I was wound up
and and upset when I wrote started this thread (obviously).  The funny
thing about it, in retrospect, is that I never really wanted anything
but a haste item for Lenny.  That was it.  And I didn't expect to get
near enough for one for that bracer.  The only reason I was taking bids
was because I wanted to be fair to both parties.  It would have been
much, much better for everyone if I have just "WTS BoTH, 2K, Firm. 
First tell gets it".  That would have ended the whole thing in about 30
seconds (because that how fast the offers started coming in).
   As for was it worth it to get the extra items to lose "R"'s good
will?  No and yes.  No, my rep is very important to me.  On FV, at
higher levels, rep is critical.  There are so many fewer players, and
not so many alts (though Lenny and I do have a 3rd account with baby
Lizard Shaman called Lentea).  You really do start running into the same
people over and over again.  Several people I know of have rerolled
after getting trashed  on the FV community EZ Board.  My name is easy to
remember, so I want to be especially careful.
   And on the other hand, yes.  Not because I really needed those
items.  But because, well, I not too sure that I want to have any more
business dealing with "R" myself.  I bent over backwards trying to be
gracious, but it didn't seem to matter to him.  If I were mad at
someone, and they were obvious upset that they had made me so, I would
at least take that into account.  Especially if the situation were one
like this, where I was partially responsible for the build up.  It was
obvious to all involved that "T" and "R" were much more experienced with
high end items than I was.  I dunno.  I just don't want to go through
something like that again.  If I do start another business deal with
"R", and he says "Hey, I remember you.  Bug off."  I truly doubt that I
would I feel like cutting my wrists.

Annie <--- Probably wouldn't feel that about anything in the game,
really.
