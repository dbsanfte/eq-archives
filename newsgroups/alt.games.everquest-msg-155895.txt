Not quite.  Large sewing kits always had 10 slots, and they weighed less
than the backpacks, but... it used to be that whenever you hit combine on
something it would combine all of the items.  Did it twice, lost a set of
crafted on my warrior and then lost an FBR and GSD on the same day.  Was
pretty sad.  When Verant made the DNC's that didn't actually combine, the
10-slot sewing kits became an unfair advantage.  They had their weight
raised and became Deluxe sewing kits, and the Large ones are as we know them
to be today.

Large sewing kits pre-combine-destroying-everything had 10-slots and weighed
less, it was just really easy to destroy stuff and that was a decent
detraction for most people.

I still them on my characters and don't think I would sell them just because
I happened to have them before a patch.  Besides, I like having something
deluxe :)
