+7str
+7sta

The helm I am wearing I have had for...oooh...a good 15 levels and cost me
20pp, a Skull Shaped Barbute, every newbie warrior should have one but at
47th I figured I should upgrade..so what are the advantages on this new,
2000pp helm...well AC is the same, 13 it has 7str but I have over my 150
target now so I am not to bothered and I'd lose the 10% MR from the
Barbute...hmmm...Ahhh but it has 7 Sta and that would give me about an extra
30health...But the SSB gives me 35 health so I'd actually be losing health,
in fact the only thing I can see that is better is the weight 0 for the
Hammerhead and 5 for the SSB <SHRUG> After all this time there is apperently
still no comparison to the SSB in it's price range (or 10 x it's price)
Looks like I might be hanging onto this until I get a cobalt helm. Any other
suggestions, reasonable ones. Although I am now the level to go on plane
raids I really don't have the time.

would give me 1 extra AC but at a cost of
