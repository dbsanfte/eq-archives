You've fallen into that trap of thinking that the only "rights" you have are
government-granted.  I have many more rights than those given to me by the
government.  If I were a Cox subscriber, obviously at this time I would have
the right to read whatever newsgroup is at issue here (long since lost in
the thread).  It's not a government-granted right, it's a bought right by
subscribing to Cox's services, including providing access to newsgroups,
including that one.

Until you understand that, you will have zero grasp of the actual issue.
