Why so much concern over the power supply?  A $1500 machine won't even max
out a 350 watt power supply, much less cause you to want twice that.  I'm
running extra fans, liquid cooling, neon lighting and dual video cards on
450 watts.

I would recommend stopping by your local grocery store and looking at
Computer Shopper's "$1500 Roundup" edition (or whatever it may be called in
the current incarnation, it's always in-print).  It might give you some
better options.  I wouldn't purchase from any of the companies you listed
unless I had a specific reason for doing so, such as working for a company
that gives a hefty discount with Dell like mine does.
