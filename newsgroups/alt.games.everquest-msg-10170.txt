A really good use for this spell is when me and my buddy - a Shaman-
uses his Canabalize spell 50hps for 25 mana... He does that, as I
"Empathize" and we get a great boost on downtime, considering we are
both Trolls, with regen on... This is one of the reasons I prefer the
SK/Shaman combo to the Monk/Shaman combo.
