Amen to that, Brother Jakugg!

The nerves scare me, I must say.  I went into duel mode with a lvl 40 Druid
and tashed and charmed her on the first try, so I am not pumped up about
getting charmed by an Evil-eye, even with my anti-magic buffs.  It will be
exciting, I'm sure, but I'm still not looking forward to it.

I will actually be doing the camps with my Chanter and his pals and
multiquesting the armor, with my warrior handing in the gems.  Assuming you
can multi these, of course.

My good buddy whom I gave a GBS to is a level 34 Wiz right now, and solos
exclusively, so ports are plentiful.  He'll even help with the "camps" to
break the monotony of soloing and jewelry making.

One of my friend has 1 character, a level 30 Ranger.  He kind of quit
playing because he is getting tired of soloing Mammoths.  I figure that he
and I and the Wiz can hopefully find a group in Sol A so he can get his Ivy
Etched quest piece and I can get the fire totem for the helm.  I want to
give my current helm back to Duesservus ( my cleric ) since the one I
obtained for him isn't wearable by Dwarves.

I remember your posts.  Makes me want to start drinking coffee.

I would love to camp the one in OOT, but I am not near high enough, I don't
think.  But, me and a few buds are going to attempt the S. Ro. one
relatively soon.  I was on during the day yesterday and went through S. Ro 2
times and there were only 2 people in the zone over 25.  Unfortunately, I
usually work at this time.  At peak times, the zone is full of high-levels.
I don't believe he is a random spawn, but figuring out his spawn would be
near impossible with all the people killing in the zone.  So, we'll just go
in and kill everything in the zone repeatedly until he spawns and try to get
there first.  It'll be tough with the others KSing, but it's worth a shot,
assuming we can try at around 2:00am...

Any idea if this guy can be charmed in S. Ro?
