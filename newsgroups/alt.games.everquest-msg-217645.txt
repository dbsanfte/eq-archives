Some of those froggie shaman will cast see invis on themselves, and
perhaps their melee friends.  I tried that route once (on your
recommendation!) and found it riskier than OT->FM->LOIO.  With Lev
and SoW FM is trivial to cross safely, so really the only risk is
if you try to cross OT at night and cross paths with those damned
'goons.
