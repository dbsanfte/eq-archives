I think this might be inherent in a game where the endgame is "fight bigger
mobs, to get stuff to fight even bigger mobs", and I think the lack of such
an endgame is a major reason that DAoC has had a fairly stable economy
mostly free of mudflation--since their endgame is realm-vs-realm PvP, they
haven't had to keep massively upping the player's power to keep ahead of
players "winning" the game, like EQ has had to do.  DAoC has to add new
powers and abilities for variety to counter long term players getting bored
with their characters, whereas EQ has to add them so the high level people
will have something to do.  Adding things to counter boredom is a lot easier
to do without screwing up your game.

Isn't WoW going to have a PvP endgame?  If so, that's one of the things that
will lean me toward it over EQ2.  PvP done right is a lot of fun without
turning into an FPS-style gankfest, or a griefer's playground, and offers
the game company a way off the bigger-mob treadmill, so it seems the way to
go.  On the other hand...it seems really easy to do PvP wrong.  So far,
pretty much everyone other than Mythic seems to get it wrong, which greatly
puzzles me.  Mythic is sitting out there with 250k subscribers...you'd think
someone would be saying "let's copy DAoC!" instead of everyone saying
"let's copy EQ1!".

If anyone who is thinking of starting development on a new MMORPG is reading
this, here are the lessons you should learn from DAoC and try to copy:

    1. Have PvP as the endgame.

    2. Pick an existing setting (either realworld or fantasy) for your game,
    rather than making one up.  Games can be successful making one up (EQ1),
    but in a competitive market, you'll have an easier time if people are
    somewhat familiar with your story.  However, don't pick something that
    people are *too* familiar with.  I think Star Wars, for example, is a
    lousy setting for an MMORPG, because:

        A. People are familiar enough with it they will have strong
        expectations about things and be disappointed anywhere the game
        deviates from those,

        B. The source (e.g., the movies) are too focused on a small group of
        characters, and a lot of people will be disappointed if the game
        doesn't follow the things those characters did.

    Albion, Hibernia, and Midgard worked great for them, because most people
    know *something* about the various mythologies of those places, but
    aren't familiar enough with them to notice places where they've changed
    things, or added stuff, or botched stuff.

    It will be interesting to see how Middle Earth Online does.  Will people
    care to play Hobbits and such if they aren't involved in something like
    the quest to destroy the Ring?

    3. License an engine.  Mythic is using the Gamebryo engine from NDL.
    Licenses for that are something like $50k/year per title, plus $25k/year
    for maintenance and updates and support.  That's less than the cost of
    of *one* developer.  Being able to stay state-of-the-art for less than
    the cost of one developer is a freaking good deal, so take it.  Your
    developers can concentrate on the things that make your game cool,
    instead of concentrating on stuff like how to get shadows looking right
    or how to deal with differences between ATI and NVidia shader
    implementations or crap like that.
