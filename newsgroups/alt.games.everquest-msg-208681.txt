Druids get ports and evacs to various spots. Self version first and a
spellround later a groupversion. They also get succor which gets them or
their group to the evac point in the same zone.

Wizards get most of the same ports and evacs as druids but to slightly
different locations in the same zones. Wizards also get the special Plane of
Hate and Plane of Air ports. Self and group succor they get as well.
The main difference between Wizards and Druids though is that wizzies get
targetted port spells. They get them eventually for all purposes including
zone-succor for a target and AE port to bind (very usefull for raids).

If you want the specific levels of when they get what spell I would advice
loking them up at http://lucy.fnord.net or http://eq.crgaming.com.

Casters realm is sometimes a bit off with manacost and exact descriptions,
but the list of spells is more usefull for quick ref because of the short
descriptions on the total spell lists.

As for your specific question:
At level 52, wizards get the spell: Translocate Group, which ports all
persons in the group to their respective bind points.
