Here I am, congratulating myself on being able to access the patch 
server, and looking forward to a little GoD love before going to bed, 
when I came across a recurrent download error... The patcher claims I 
don't have sufficient privileges to write the file qcat.s3d, which is 
self-evidently ridiculous (and, just in case, I've rebooted, and made 
sure all files in the Everquest directory are writable).

Anybody else having a similar problem?

Thanks.
