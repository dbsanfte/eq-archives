This happened to my guild once. They (I wasn't on the raid) were on
Hate, somewhere on the second floor, when the server went down hard
late in the evening (close to midnight CET, IIRC). A lot of frustrated
folks were hammering the login server, hoping for the server to come
back up, but it didn't, and it became obvious that they'd face a real
nice problem, logging back in to a fully popped second floor the next
day.

The guild leader petitioned, and got a GM to summon people to SRo,
IIRC, and rez the dead. After that was done, we went back up and
wiped against Inny when the main tank and a cleric LD'd right at
the start of the fight, but that's another story, heh.
