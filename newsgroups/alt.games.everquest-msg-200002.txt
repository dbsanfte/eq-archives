As a note, who ever wrote this review is an absolute moron who
obviously has never played the retail version. It's apparent that he
played beta for two days or less. The bugs he describe do not exist in
the retail version. The screenshot he's provided are from beta. This
guy is truly ignorant. I suggest you all look at a few more reviews
(they are mostly very very good) before you put any stock into this
fool.
