But there IS no equality.  That is my point.

In the eyes of the law, a homosexual is different from a straight
person.  A black man is different from a white man.  A lady in a
wheelchair is different from a lady who isn't.

How can we EVER hope to achieve true equality when it is the very laws
that throw such differences up in our face??

I agree...  There HAS to be an anti-discrimination law...  YOu will
NOT get an argument from me on this..

But let's have an EQUAL Anti-Discrimination law...

Regardless of ANYTHING, if you discriminate against someone, FOR ANY
REASON, you are breaking the law...

Rich, poor, black, white, gay, straight.. Do you know why the statue
of Lady Justice is blindfolded??

Because she is supposed to be blind to anything but the law..  We have
tore that blindfold off of her and whispered in her ear, "OK gay
people should not be discriminated against.  Black people should not
be discriminated against."

Which is all well and good, but it serves to seperate people into
groups. It BUILDS barriers instead of removing them..

So, how far a leap is it to go from watch words like "sexual
orientation" etc etc to simply state, "Thou shalt not discriminate."
Period??

Generic seems to work when it's specific. (Like that??  :^)  hehehehe)
Why not be really generic??

SO, now it's about "me" and not about the subject at hand...  <sigh>
Well, if you want to talk about me, I guess I'll oblige you..

Why do you insist on putting me in a box??  "Left wing" "right wing"
"fascist" etc etc etc..

I talk about the wonders of equality, because it truly is wonderful.
But I don't see anything equal in the anti-discrimination laws.

You lost me?? "Define quality"???

I am FOR anti-discrimination. I just don't want special groups singled
out.

Now, I may be behind the times, I'll admit that.  I was in Oregon when
there was this big snafu over specifically granting special
protections to homosexuals.  NOT to sexual orientation, but
specifically to homosexuals. 

And THAT is where my animosity comes from.

Now, if YOU say that all the laws are generic (as you mentioned above)
then I say that is a good start..

However, we then fall into the trap of leaving people out..

If I understand you correctly, you are saying that the laws say:
"You cannot discriminate based on

Sexual Orientation
Race
Religion

etc etc etc...

DO you know what THAT says to me??

That says, "It's *OK* to discriminate, as long as you don't
discriminate based on sexual orientation, etc etc etc..."

Personally, I feel it's NOT ok to discriminate based on ANYTHING...

But that is just me, I spose.. 

Ya know, the left-wing, right-wing, fascist, illiterate, no-logic
mo-fo......   :^)
