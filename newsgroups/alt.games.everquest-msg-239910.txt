During the past 2 weeks, I have been trying to get J-Boots for my Rogue
by hunting the Ancient Cyclops in South Ro. I have been told at least a
dozen strategies by different people. In those 2 weeks, I have seen it 3
times. Twice it was killed by the Dark Elf merchants and the other it
popped on a high level who killed it in a very short time.

Can somebody please confirm that there is a way to spawn it and what the
method is? Thank you in advance.
