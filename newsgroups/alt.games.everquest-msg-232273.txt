Taxi cab Confession Part II: (this is even worse)

I STILL have 2 batskull earrings on him (65 chanter). Ive been meaning
to do the Solstice earring - just have to get off my ass and do it.
Ive been spending most of my cash on my SK, that and saving up for
Voice of Q (dang - thats a hard spell to find, when I DO see it up for
sale, its at LEAST 70k). Been hoping to try and get that ruby earring
that drops in SG.

Yeah I can see that. And Ill probably get them for just that purpose
(since Im sure I have the quest gem laying around somewhere).

Do you remember the mob they drop off of in BOT? I might try for
those, since its one of the few zones I have access to that I have a
chance at the runes for level 65 spells (not very pop-flagged at this
time). Altho I hate the zone. Great AAXp but the trains are rediculous
there.
