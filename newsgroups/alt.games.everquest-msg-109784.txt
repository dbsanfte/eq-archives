No necessarily.  What you do is what you do.  People are not
independent of their actions.

The results of what people do *might* be evil, but I doubt very many
people every actually do set out to do things that are evil.

True evil is a rare, rare thing.  IMHO, naturally.

Is it a rationalization if you really, honestly believe that what
you're doing isn't evil?

I'm almost certain that Osama doesn't think what he's doing is wrong.
I'll wager that, if we were able to see into his mind that we'd see a
man that thinks he's standing up to a great evil.  We'd see a man who
honestly believes he's doing a good thing.

Hell, I bet Saddam doesn't think he's committing evil acts.  I think
that overgrown thug merely sees what he's doing as 'convenient'.
Since he's probably a pure psychopath (in my no degree having, only
took Psyche 101 opinion) I don't think he's capable of empathy and is
probably incapable of see what he's doing as wrong.

But then again, we're way into the realm of speculation.

>My point is, and has always been, that evil is an illness.  

I see.  We're coming at it from different angles.  I see evil as a
thing unto itself.  To me evil is a big thing.  

I forget the name of the town, but there's a small town in Poland, and
during WWII the Germans came rolling in.  They told the people in the
town that they had to get rid of all the jews in town.  And people did
it.  They did it to people they had known their whole lives.  And they
did it eagerly apparently.  That, to me, is evil.  Hitler, he was just
a sad, warped little man who couldn't see anything outside himself and
his hate.  These people had to know what they were doing was wrong,
but they caved.  I could understand if they just turned the jews over
to the germans.  Fear makes people do bad things.  But they committed
the acts with verve.  They did it like they wanted to.

As a note, before people jump my shit, I'm not apologizing for what
Hitler/Stalin/InsertFamousPsychopathHere did.  The acts they committed
were ultimately evil.  But I do believe that evil is a state that can
be independent of human intent.

So you're saying that even "healthy" self interest is evil?

Someone who actually believed in Satan?  :-)
