I checked it out out of curiosity today when georg linked it - it was 
interesting enough, until I got partway into it and then it said I had 
to 'make a friend' to do another quest - is this the only way to 
progress, or am I wasting my time on side stuff and there's other stuff 
to do?  I loathe that random "Make me your friend and I'll make you 
mine?" crap, but none of the other NPCs I approached (in the oh, half an 
hour I had to play - where's the goddamn clock/windowed mode in that 
game?  I was nearly late for work!)

And yes, I know it's an MMORPG, but dammit, I've done like one quest.  
Seems a little early to be shopping for a guild ;p
