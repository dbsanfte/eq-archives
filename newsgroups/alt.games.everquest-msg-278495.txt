I am stuffed if i can find the doll. I even tried resetting the zone to put it in a easier to find place. No luck! The 
thing that bugs me is that the location is random and there's nothing stopping it from being inside a tree or something. 
  I can't use reason to find it, there are no clues, you can't ask the other kids who might have an idea, etc.

I spent 2 hours looking for it, and if they kill of the quest now with this patch, I will be vexed!
