It's funny that I find bard kiting difficult yet bard charming so easy. I
was pretty much straight mellee till I got Charm and since then I have to
make a point of melleeing to keep the skills up - it kicks butt ; )

I guess when the gloss wears off the Charm necessity will force me to bite
the bullet and get profficient in Bard kiting as well, at the moment I am
proberly the only (just dinged) 30 bard around who hasn't used Brusco's
beyond the odd pull....  : o
