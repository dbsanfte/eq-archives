My necro is lvl 15 in lavastorm now and i use

Lifedraw
leech
engulfing darkness
lesser shielding
disease cloud  good for stoping the mob's regen
grim aura
dark pact
posion bolt

I will play again now until he reaches lvl 16 and as you said it takes
forever even soloing(with pet)

I also read that scent of dusk may lower res on the mob enough so
that heat blood would work, that would be nice, i will try it now..

/Regards Berth (Thotamon lvl 15 DE necro Luclin)
