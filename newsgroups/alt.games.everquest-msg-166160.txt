You seem to be assuming they are exactly the same size. And if they
were, what's the point in breaking them down or differentiating them in
any way? If you're going to break down something "larger" into something
"smaller", then you're going to have more than one "smaller" item by
definition, yes? I'm not saying a large block has to yield two small
blocks, but if it's not going to, it could at least yeild a small block
and a piece or two.
