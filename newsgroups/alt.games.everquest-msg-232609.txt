From the shadows, the mysterious dennis_melton@csx.com (VZRanger) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Have a Level 35 Ranger, dual wield, and would like to know what the

Acc to Allakhazam there are 895 different one handed weapons usable by
a ranger.

You're going to have to give an indication of what you can afford to
get to narrow the field down a bit.

But barring that the best two 1h weapons you are likely to be able to
get (but this is frm my experience with the bazaar on *test*, might be
a different story in proddyland) would be the hammer from Droga,
copper hammer of striking (13/20) and the highest ratio weapon you can
afford in offhand, perhaps the 14/21 axe of the scions from LDoN.
