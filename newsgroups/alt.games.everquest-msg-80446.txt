How true.  Which means that your class quests don't require you to 
perform an assortment of heinous crimes (or even better yet, pay 
somebody else to perform them for you).  Hopefully Brad's worked off his 
hate-hickey for paladin-types in EQ and whatever new game he is involved 
in won't pretend that it somehow enriches role-play to require the "good 
guys" to be bad guys unless they want to cripple themselves (of course 
in EQ paladins are cripples in the high end game regardless, but that's 
another rant entirely).
