6 people, we have lots of fair ways to do loot.  I'm looking for one where

you have a guild of 100 people, 30 of whom are at a raid, 5 showed up
late, 10 come to every raid, 10 come to quite a few, 5 only come
occaisionally and 5 mysteriously only show up on raids where stuff they
want drops.

I personally -still- prefer a nice simple pure random for this, but people

complain that this encourages the last 5, and for that matter doesn't
penalize the 5 latecommers... so they use points systems, which I find
distribute -all- the loot to the first set of ten.

Problem being that on a 1 to 6 roll you are going to get a lot of ties.

Seed is annoying... but having seen hacks in action which allowed you
to fake a roll, the idea of randomizing the roll does at least have a hint

of legitimacy.

See, the hack I saw was very limitted;

/ran 520
would return a roll of 498

every time.  Because really the guy wasn't rolling to 520 at all, he was
somehow triggering the game to make fake lines that read just like a
real roll.  By introducing the seed you made it so that hacker would have
had to make a thousand similar hacks, and then find and use the correct
one in order to win a roll.

Of course he could simply make a phony "seed" roll which would
return a known "roll to" for which he'd have a second hack ready with
a preprogrammed probable winner roll.  If -you- generate the seed,
though, you know it was real.  So everyone who is sufficiently
anal/paranoid to care this deeply about such an improbable event
wants to roll the seed themselves.

I don't sweat stuff in a group situation like this, a simple roll to
whatever winner gets it, or at end of session all loot that isn't "no
drop"
goes to a single roll, pick in order highest roll to lowest, repeat
if there's anything left over.

But as I pointed out that isn't what this thread is about.
