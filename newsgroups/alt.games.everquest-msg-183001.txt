Pay?  No, I said a real componets. Dots aint heavy and if you want the
points bring the gem. that simple besides on a PvP I hate cash. Same
for chanters in pickup groups, expect me to spend 12p to up thier hp
but it aint worth them carring a tiny little gem, which means in
reality it aint worth the 12p.

Best tanks and chanters I everplayed with supplied dots for the
buffs!!! OMG imagine that.

BTW If tyou are on a PvP server Dots make good safe cash, never had
anyone turn em down yet 4 gets me kei, one gets me ported, and one
gets you symbol.
