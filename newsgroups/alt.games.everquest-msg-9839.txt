Again, from http://eq.castersrealm.com:

*** Begin quote ***

It is important that you petition to have a missing
corpse problem addressed within 5 days of the patch!

We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost
after that time. In fact, it would be best for you to
petition immediately if you have a problem. Don't
wait. If you are worried about a corpse that you were
unable to deal with before the patch, then please log
in an check on it right away after the patch.
