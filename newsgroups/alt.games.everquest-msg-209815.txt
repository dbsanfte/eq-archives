Ok War have one BIG problem, no manna hense no agro spells.
Until that changes SKs will hold the agro card and thats the big plus
in xp groups and a lot of raids. Sorry it only gets worse later hense
my 55 warrior is parked while my SK gets played... a lot. Good thing
is SK is more fun, if you like to RP a goodie pick a pally same holds
true mostly.

Err rethinking this...dont play an SK they suck and need more goodies
to be playable, ok SoE? Warriors need nerfing badly.

I feel so cheap now.....
