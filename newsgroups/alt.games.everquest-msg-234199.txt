A person that knows how to solo knows how to group. There may be reasons
like the the solo'er has such great equipment they never had to learn how to
properly solo, but I doubt it.

I would take someone who knows how to solo in a group over someone who did
nothing but group in places like PC where you learn nothing. If you know how
to kill and get experience by yourself, then having 5 another yoyo's helping
you out shouldn't present a real problem. Since virtually 100% of the
current player base speed levels in PC, that puts the remainder of people
who only solo at 0. It would be a extremely rare case to find one. I haven't
leveled a character to w/o using PC myself since it became available I can
say with certainty that no one learns anything there even if they are
trying.

I mean look at the example given here of multiple over pulls. You are
telling me that is done by someone who solos?
