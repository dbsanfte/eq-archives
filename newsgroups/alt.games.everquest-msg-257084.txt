Divine Arbitration isn't a targetted AA, it hits the entire group, 
equalizing out hp.  Targetting your slower isn't necessary, if he's in 
your group you can just watch his HP bar, and if he isn't, the your DArb 
isn't going to do him a bit of good.

Darb is a fantastic AA, as it can land for near CHeal level heals with 
absolutely no aggro component... but its also a potential death sentence 
if anyone in your group happens to have a much lower HP max than the 
rest; the DArb can drop his HP down so far he gets low HP aggro and eats 
hot mob death.

I've never really heard of anyone using it to save a slower, and it 
strikes me as a relatively poor tool for doing so; if the slower is a 
shaman then he's probably got plenty of hp, but is also probably using 
stoicism/torpor/quintessense and not in much danger.  If he's an 
enchanter, his HP is probably so low that when you DArb him he may end 
up with fewer HP than he started with, because of damage the MT and 
other people in the group may have.

Even post DArb, if the slower still has aggro he's no better off than he 
was before, with that mob still beating him down, and him at perhaps 
5/6th his HP total.  Its far more important that someone get the mob off 
of him if its a problem, and if it isn't (slower is a shaman and the 
boss isn't all that bossy) then the DArb heal isn't all that important 
anyway.

What I'd reccomend doing, instead, is to use DArb as a heal on the MT, 
or the puller (depending on which you are grouped with) on incoming, 
which will allow the slower to wait a little longer on the slow, the MT 
will have more time to get his aggro up, you won't get any aggro at all 
for your initial heal, which will also be much better timed (no 10 
second lead time to deal with), and hopefully the slower won't end up 
with aggro at all, which is a much better deal than using DArb to heal 
the slower.

Another thought is to have a paladin MT grouped with the DArb cleric; 
this is a double whammy as the cleric uses DArb to heal on incoming, 
then the pally hits his group heal, which ends up doing a lot of hp 
healing as everyone is hurt from the DArb; this tends to help his aggro 
aquisition a lot; almost as though he'd somehow managed to pump out a 
Cheal of his own, which in effect he has.
