Jboots are faster than mob speed.  For 99% of your EQ life, "faster than mob"
is all you ever need.

Selos is blindingly fast.. at 27 I was faster than my 57 druid friend.  She
commented
that she was almost keeping up... so I took off walk.

Most mobs, though aren't that fast.

Sure, Selos is great for travelling across zones.  And its fun for pulling Snow
Griffins
(which eat rangers for dinner, seen it often) and other "faster than SOW" mobs.
Its even nice for going out and finding the mob you want to pull... get to roam
the
zone clicking track covering much more ground.

But once you have your mob, Selos is a pain.  You either keep it up, which costs

you 1/3rd of your singing output, or you drop it.. and then it isn't there when
you
get that surprise add or go LHP or whatever.  If you aren't juggling in a drum
on
the beat, its only as fast as a level 9 SOW anyway.  Guess how fast JBoots are?
Level 9 SOW!

Selos also lasts only 18 seconds.  Go into a dungeon and its out almost before
you
are done zoning.  JBoot effect lasts what, 20 minutes?  Plenty to cross a zone,
or usefull if hunting near zoneline inside.

For me the arguement isn't "JBoots or rely on selos?"  Its "JBoots or TBoots?"

Eventually I'll get a selos that lasts 2 and a half minutes.  Still no J/TBoot
duration,
but a lot better than what I have now.  That being the case, the annoyance of
the
AC camp probably isn't worth while... after all it will only take around 5250pp
to
buy TBoots instead.  Confirmation that I can TBoot while moving will certainly
push me in that direction.
