Sorry, but there is no comparable quest armor. Elder spiritist's is
out of your league for now, too. I guess your best option if you just
want a different look is a brown chitin protector and black chitin
leggings, which will give you plate look. Both should be relatively
cheap these days and while neither have wis, the legs have a little
mana and the BCP has some other stats.
