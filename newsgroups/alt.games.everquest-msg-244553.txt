depending on your server, there are two places taht can be called
'jail'......

1 lower zone out (i'm sure some have called it 'jail') -- from the big rock,
jump into the water and swim through the tunnels, and when you get out, kill
the frog or two at the bottom, then swim down more...when you come up, there
will be either four or six cells in the room you arrive in, and the lower
zone out will be behind a door (not locked) on your left ....

2 cage (it could be 'jail' also) -- at the big rock, turn right and go over
the first bridge, start heading down, and cage is the area with the 'caged
door' and the cells behind it, coming up on the left as you walk the area
with water to the right

~other camps~

disco -- back at the big rock, go to the extreme left (ignoring the upper
zone out at your immediate left) and head across that bridge, and as you
move down that long hall, disco is the circular platform in the building at
the center of the main room

rare hall -- back at the rock, head straight across to where the necrosis
scarabs used to spawn (they don't drop gems though, they got nerfed) and go
down through that tunnel ...a rogue will need to picklock the door at the
base of the pyramid

for the other camps, such as king or juggs/reet, you have to head past lower
zone out, and it's best to just have a map =)
