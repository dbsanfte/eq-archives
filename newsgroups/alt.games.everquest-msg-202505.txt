  It's a natural ability that the large races get and
not a real skill, so no, you won't see any messages
telling you that you've gotten better at it.  I think you
will see small increases in damage as you get higher
in levels; my 55 ogre sometimes does as much as
24 or 25 damage on a slam.

  The nicest thing about it is that it works the same
as the Bash skill, which you'd normally need to equip
a shield to be able to use.  But with Slam, we can
wield a 2-hand weapon and still use Slam to disrupt
spell casters or stun a fleeing mob.

  The above is true for my ogre anyways. I assume it
will work the same for your barbarian :)
