I tend not to ask, you've got to believe a good 30% of your guild at
any one time is pissed off with some aspects of day to day guild life
but most won't say anything to avoid "drama".

Well yes you HAVE to show patience if you want specific high demand
items however things that are a bit lower down the scale are within
the grasp of anyone, people tend to forget that even poor drops are
often better than what you could expect to get in the Bazaar without
spending five figures and up.

/sigh.  A variant of this happened tonight.  Ssra's gimpiest mob was
found to be up and we had sufficient forces outside his room a short
while later, then we had sufficient-if-75%-were-AFK forces, then we
had stupid-overkill-forces-please-god-let-others-not-find-out all
because some people weren't present to earn their almost invisible
DKP.  Mob could have been dead before most of the people present had
logged on instead we arsed around until a Wizard finally snapped and
proceeded to tank.  The only loot anyone could use was the Ord and a
copy of GRC too.

Fifty percent of cost refunded once you upgrade.

Oh I can forsee much throwing of rattles in the future when hybrids,
for example, make it known that they would really quite like the
opportunity to buy items with spell focus effects and not just
Vengeance in every slot.  I've spent a bunch of AA making sure I can
heal a lot better than a vanilla Ranger and plan on spending even
more in the future, same with nukes.

In my guild a Rogue would almost certainly get it as we have two
hardcore Rogues and zero hardcore Bards (even though one has 150+ AA
points).  However, if it came down to it I'm sure the person with the
highest points would be allowed to loot it whether they be Bard or
Rogue simply because either class could happily argue the weapon is a
"good fit" for them whether it be for uber backstabs or song
benefits.

I'll be sure to mention this to our Officers around Xmas 2003 when
finally get to PoEb though. ;)

I don't think bidding will happen and price cutting at the time
doesn't seem likely either, you might see that item discounted and
points refunded retrospectively however.  We had 2 x Hammer of Battle
end up homeless last week, one went to a twink that happened to be
camped in the zone and the other was trashed but I don't think anyone
was bothered.  If Dain's hammer was going to rot/twink though I'd
pipe up even though I'd only ever use it as a clickie.

Yeah I've seen the "no one bids so it MUST rot" idea before and it's
harsh but fair.  Once people are aware that no bids have come in then
you sometimes get interest at the second time of asking.

We're currently in the middle of "Shard Hell" and I can sense
frustration in those being forced to cobble together Emp key groups
since most of the guild now have their Shissar rings but, hey, no
pain no gain in EQ as in RL.

Heh, no he's well short and wouldn't take anything that a main could
use but it would have been interesting had no one wanted it and it
ended up gravy like the Spectral that went to a Bard.   Ewww.

We did another 8th shawl tonight although I was skulking in CoD
getting the first non raid xp in 10 weeks so had a pseudo valid
excuse to not go.
