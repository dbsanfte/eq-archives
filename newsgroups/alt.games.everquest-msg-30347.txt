Exactly. When you pop into a zone, your +hp items aren't taken into
account. If you have less hps than naked you effectively die before
those items are added, even if they'd save you.

I think the reason was more to prevent a dupe bug. The lag/time
difference during zoning between the server and local PC means locally,
you would have completed the zoning intact, whilst the servers have your
clothed corpse in the other zone, meaning 2 sets of equipment
