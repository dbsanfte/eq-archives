One wonders what the point is in that. It's not a 'user' aspect of the
interface, really. You can't do anything with it, and a minute amount
of time is spent at it. Sounds like change for the sake of change,
which I'm never in favor of.

About time!

That is the best thing I've heard so far about the interface. I'm a
numbers junky, so being able to see all of the skill numbers is a
happy thing!

Also nice, but probably Not Enough to suit me. I really think they
ought to just give up and supply numbers across the board. Sure, the
numbers don't make sense in context of a character, but many (I'd
guess most) people would like to have them anyway.

Oooof. Yes, I think your prediction is right on the money there.

Ok, you have to wonder how they screwed that up. 

Thanks for the info Annie!
