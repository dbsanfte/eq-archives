Only things I can think of is...

1) Mac Servers are Mac only so if you or a buddy want to play and you each
have different systems, one of you will have to purchase a new system.

2) Mac players are much kinder in their game play. (stems from Macs being
used by a higher breed of people)

That is my experience from the Beta.
