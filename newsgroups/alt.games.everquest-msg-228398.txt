No flamelick?  I <3 flamelick.  And if you have the space, have tangling
weeds up as well as snare. Faster-casting than snare, and a lot less
mana.  Definitely helps me grab aggro fast.  Beyond that I have no advice
to give, due to not being there...but yes, make sure flamelick is the
second spell you cast after snare if you are tanking.
