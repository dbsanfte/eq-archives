You just nailed it. The question of whether the platinum in his 
'possession' or 'under his control' is not clear.

While I *DO* see your point, and don't disagree with your conclusion, 
the reality is there is another side to this argument that does have 
legitimacy:

Sony asserts they own it, Sony's EULA expressly says you do not own it. 
  And Sony can remove it at a whim, just as they did with millions of 
tribute points when they caught the tribute valuation errors. Or if they 
ban your account (which does happen).

Of course not. However, Union Station has never stated as a condition of 
using their lockers that everything in those lockers belongs to Union 
Station.

Lets assume for a minute that the lockers and bags all *belong to Union 
Station*.

Now suppose I pay Union station for a key to access that locker, and pay 
a monthly fee for the priviledge of opening that locker, looking at 
whats in it, carrying it around union station, and trading the contents 
of the bag with other bag holders wandering around at union station.

Now suppose it gets taken from the locker that I have key to, have *I* 
been robbed? Or has union station been robbed?? Union Station has. And 
its up to union station to seek reparations. I'm just paying for access 
to the locker, I don't own whats in it. As long as I have access to the 
locker I'm getting exactly what I'm paying for.

Now suppose it gets taken from the locker that I have a key to, to 
another Union Station locker that i do not have the key too. Have I been 
robbed? No, it wasn't my property. Has Union Station been robbed? No, 
its still on their property.

Your argument is logical, but it presumes that the buyer and seller have 
some sort of legal ownership of the plat in the first place. That 
assumption may not actually be true. We already saw Sony 'disappear' 
millions of tribute points (which can be bought with pp on a 1:1 scale) 
and there was little more than grumbling from the community. Certainly 
nobody saw fit try to legally challenge the issue (that i ever heard about).
