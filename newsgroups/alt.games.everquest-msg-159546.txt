Another question, if I wanted to make a character to raise up for working on
tradeskills, what would be the best class?  Interested mainly in Smithing,
Tailoring, and Jewelcraft.  Not really after the whole money thing, but just
experiencing another side of the game.

I've thought about Enchanters, purely for the jewelcraft and also enchanting
various parts for other tradeskills.

I've thought about ranger for the whole farming aspect (would say druid, but
personally I find druids entirely too boring a class), but rangers aren't
supposed to kill bears/wolves so farming pelts would be an issue there.  As
a side question, do rangers/druids actually lose faction or anything bad
from killing bears and wolves?  I'd probably have issues with doing it
purely for the role-play aspect of the character, but still would like to
know (just to file away in the Useless Information File in my head).

I would use my cleric, but farming is an issue with a class that can't solo
to save her life (literally).

The tanking classes would be nice for the farming aspect, but would suffer
greatly in the WIS/INT category.

Guess the base of the question is how are Enchanters at farming/soloing?
Haven't had the gumption yet to play one (have this whole issue of being the
best I can at a class, so I've sort of worked my way up the ladder in terms
of skill needed to play a class) so I don't know how they do in those kinds
of situations.

Thanks in advance for any feedback.
