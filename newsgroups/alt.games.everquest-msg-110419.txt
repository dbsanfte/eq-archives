I might have misled you on the meaning there. I'm saying that if Verant
wanted to put any association with a person's character in the new game,
maybe have their characters' graves in a designated cemetery somewhere just
as a reward for achieving some hard to accomplish goal before. Kind of like
a Norath history book.

Maybe they should also have a courtyard somewhere with statues of class/race
combinations and their epics and great gear too. Like we have statues and
memorials for famous historical figures.

I'm meaning this more in a history/famous people way, not as wanting
characters to be moved over.

Though I think a great idea for some higher LV mobs would be some LV60 with
great gear and maybe epic or other powerful weapon.
