The billing info is already the same across the 2 accounts with the characters on them.

The new "Platinum Edition" account will be created with the same billing information.

BUT - the original owner of the account will be different for all 3 accounts.

For the 2 "from" accounts, the Station registration information can be changed to match my
information (in fact, I have already done so).  But I can never be the 'original' owner of
the account, therefore my need for risk assessment.
