More coif failures.  Im beginning to wonder if its even possible to make
atm... I know the ele stuff isn't trivial at 250, but I've had full sets of
leather, silk, bows etc.. so I have a feel for the failure rate

Whats the other?  Honestly.. liquified earth couldn't get any more rarer.  I
did almost all muds last night, a period of like 6 hours, a full group, and
we had 1 drop the entire night.

Kept that place down all night, incl the seekers (yellow cons)... now they
just need liquified earths on their loot table or something!

Tradeskill trees for silk and bows.  me have no need!
The named tree dropped crap for us, the one an only time I've seen him up

Which is all good and well, if they weren't so insanely rare.  They need a
50% chance of a pattern/mold for how rare they are!
