Over the past three weeks, I have been getting total system lockups more
and more frequently, to the point where I usually now completely freeze
within five minutes of logging in.  I thought it might be related to the
new spell effects, but I've turned all effects completely off (and
brought the clipping plane all the way in!) and it still happens.  There
does not seem to be a pattern to what I'm doing or looking at when it
freezes.  Sometimes it even freezes during character selection or new
character creation.

I've tried defragmenting, emptying the trash, and making sure nothing
else is running.  I'm using all old models, the low-res texture set --
all the low-memory game settings I can.  So far nothing has had an
impact.

system specs are:
Windows 98
550 MHz Pentium III
640M RAM
virtual memory set to 512M min / 512M max
NVidia TNT2 Model 64 video card


Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
