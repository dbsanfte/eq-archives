Sorry don't have a list but I highly suggest you go check out Kerra Ridge. I
know it has a 20% bonus and I had a very pleasant weekend there. I didn't
kill any kitty cats there so I could participate in the quests they offer. I
earned exp off of the rat tooth quest and built up faction with the cats. It
took literally hundreds of teeth but I went from one yellow bubble 30 to
four yellow bubbles 30. Although it was a bit boring having my pet quick
kill the little buggers, I passed the time getting my baking, begging and
fishing skills way up past mastery. There is one merchant there to sell junk
to. I initiated all the quests there and completed a couple. I plan to come
back and camp Lord Gongo and get his loot and also Jo Jo the tiger. My big
prize for the time put in was earning the Kerran Fishing Rod. 3 damage, 17
delay, +2 strength. I have never heard of a weapon faster than this although
I'm sure one exists. It's one hand blunt and I cant wait to go build up the
skill and then go duel casters with it. Everywhere I went on Sunday people
kept asking about it and how to get it. I killed a fish called Razor Tooth
and turned it into a cat on a boat. Very easy kill at level 30. It is NO
DROP so you have to actually earn it instead of just buying it. This is the
first quest in the game to actually give me satisfaction for completing it.
As a side note, after playing this game for over a year now, I have never
seen another on this server. No doubt others have it but I would think not
too many, maybe less than 50 to 100. After killing spikefish for almost 12
hours while waiting for the wharf rats to spawn, the named fish spawned for
me. I can't begin to believe too many others had the patience I did for such
a minor quest compared to something like Quillmane or similar ilk. Anyway
the other interesting thing I found out was that during my entire stay, only
two other people entered the zone long enough I could notice them. Both were
druids and both were in their early teens. If you are the type who doesn't
want to have to compete with the whole world for a camp or you have a good
partner to play with, this zone has some great opportunities.
