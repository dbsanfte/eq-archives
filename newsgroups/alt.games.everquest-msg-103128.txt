No... I think it has something to do with an almost general growth of
stupidity among the American Population, mostly with the whole Parent to
Child communication issue.  Hence the recent onslaught of Fox Kids "Respect
yourself" commercials, and the Christian ads about family time.

I don't know how many people remember the reason why "Beavis and Butthead"
required a Warning before it showed, but apparently, kids who watched it
started imitating them.  Personally, I watched Beavis and Butthead, found
them rather annoying and stupid.  Of recent, American Public has this
double standard in entertainment viewing.  It is perfectly alright to have
Bugs Bunny shoot Elmer Fudd or fall down great heights and walk out without
any problems, but god forbid we show something like Robotech where people
die and don't come back.  It's perfectly alright to show people who die and
don't comeback on live tv as well.

This is probably due to the fact that the parents making the stint about
this, don't want to, or do not seem to, be active controller or filter of
their children's activities, or do not trust other parents to do the same.
Entertainment itself may be "going to hell in a handbasket" to them, but it
doesn't mean the government needs to regulate something a parent can step
in and say, "No, you can't have this.  No, you can't watch this."
