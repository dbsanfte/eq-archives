> So how do you roleplay?

Gubari, Iksar monk, is young and naive; he was raised in the swamps, in a 
very primitive environment, and came to the city mere days before the time 
for his Rebirth into the Court of Pain.  Though intelligent, his mind is 
very... deliberate.  He's a deep thinker, not a swift one.  Most of his 
time is spent (the way it is for most young Iksar) in battle.

He wants to be worthy of his masters (Glox et al) but has some doubts about 
the Empire in general.  Mostly, he has questions that need answering, but 
he hasn't entirely formed those questions yet.

Once he knows his letters a little better, he'll start writing his thoughts 
down.

He's more curious about the other races than xenocidal, but he has a strong 
dislike of froglocks and a distrust of dark elves.  He hasn't yet done much 
exploring outside of Kunark... but I imagine that he will shortly.
