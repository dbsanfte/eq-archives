Didn't hurt anyone? Try being a Cleric and not being allowed in a
group because you didn't have KEI. And when you do get a group,
constantly worrying that the group may be making better XP with a KEId
Cleric.

All because I chose not to pay the "KEI tax". On my server, that's
about 50pp every three hours.

Tell me again how KEI for everyone didn't hurt anyone.
