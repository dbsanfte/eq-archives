    That's the one! Mobile Object. I always thought it was silly in EQ and
perpetually find myself referring to them as "monsters". Also a bit
confusing because I have a tendancy to call a train a mob... ie a mob of
monsters? I mean, EQ makes monster mobs more than trains really.. my idea of
a train is what you get in Z/O/Angband... a long stream of pissed off bad
guys chasing you down the hall.

PS Now I understand why 40 people reply to the same Q with the same
answers..... when i wrote my reply it was the only one there, now its 5 down
the list... serversynch and all that. Good to see so many people being
helpful in such a short time i guess.
