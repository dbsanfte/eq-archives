I think that in addition to those points the fact that the gaming press 
online and in print has consistently hailed WoW as the state of the art 
in MMORPGs has helped sales too. When I was reading the Best of the Year 
feature on Gamespot and came to the MMORPGs section of it I knew before 
clicking the link who the winner was. I don't have to visit IGN, Gamespy 
  (yuck) and elsewhere to know who they are going to pick either. WoW 
has taken first place in the reviews and is without question the best 
MMORPG of 2004 as far as they are concerned. In fact I think a lot of 
them are saying it's the finest MMORPG ever made to date. And for a good 
number of gamers that carries some weight too.

Please don't flame me for that if you disagree. I am not saying it's my 
opinion or not. I'm just saying that the press is in love with WoW and I 
believe it's helped sales too.
