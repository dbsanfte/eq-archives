Yes, this is a pentalty, but it makes the game more realistic too.

Drive netrual and evil gnomes into extinction. At least you gain
another zone.

You are a team now right. Once the druids get ports, you can set up
supply trains of 12-18 adventures devliering supplies to remote
outposts. Or evacuate goods from hopeless zones before they give up.

The goods have two advantages:

1. Your backs agianst the wall should encouage team work.

2. You should have more mature players, rp players, and players
looking for a challenge per capita than the other teams.

Here is a possible "good" team strategy.

1. The large guilds form an alliance. The guild leaders form a concil.
2. Smaller guilds that are willing to work together are brought into
the alliance.
3. The guilds recruit all players they can find that are not jerks and
willing to participate.

Now you have an losely organized army. At this point you should try to
seek out at least one netrual guild as an ally. Now you have access to
smithing supplies.

4. Raid your local dungeons to improve gear.
5. Begin to take back terriority.

Once the druids get tp, you now have a mobile raid force, and even the
ability to move an army.
