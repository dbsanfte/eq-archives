Root       30mana - 48sec duration - 2sec cast time
Instill    60m - 1.6min duration - 2.5sec cast time
Immobilize 80m - 1min duration - 1.75sec cast time

Aside from the obvious, what's the difference? A quarter of a second 
doesn't make up for it lasting over 33% less time yet costing 33% more. 
Heck, the original Root looks pretty good for all intents and purposes.

Additionally, is one more reliable than the others for any reason? Is there 
a was to improve the chances of any of them last the full duration?

I've been using Instill for as long as I've had it, but it tends to break 
early pretty often. What does everyone else use?
