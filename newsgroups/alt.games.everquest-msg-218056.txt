The boats were one on of my least favorite things, and I can remember at
least one occasion where I did fall asleep, finger rested on the forward
key and I ran off the boat and had a real adventure in the OOT.

BUT, back when everyone was taking the boat, nobody took it very often.
There was more of a "I'm hanging around Freeport these days" sort of
feel to things. The boat constrained movement and made the world seem
larger and more exotic. 

The problem with the original crew was they were on the right track, but
in every instance difficult == tedious. the problem with the current
crew, is they are not replacing difficult with something truely
difficult, they are just removing it. The game is not becoming more
rich, just bigger and easier.

: If you want to complain about "dumbing down" of the game, you could at least
: mention a real issue like massive mudflation, or the rise of pacify pulling.

One of my earliest and best memories was when Kaev and my monk were around 
lvl 9, we decided to try to make the trip from Freeport to Qenyos, this was
back when there were no map sites to visit and Kithicor was a cakewalk.
It was a very epic feeling journey, following the path in W Commons,
dodging giants, we had very little idea on how to get thru Highpass, but
somehow made it,sweating the whole way down the long ramp in NKarana. We
knew from reports there was a bridge and while we were at the xroad
trying to determine which way to go, we got jumped and killed by a gnoll
caster.

It tooks us a couple of days, (playing alts), to get a guildmate to
help us recover the corpses, (I had given up on mine), and that was an
adventure in itself.

Now, Freeport to Qeynos, a level 1 char can, walk out the gate, go thru
the invisible wall, click the scroll, walk to the Qeynos portal, click,
and you're in Qeynos, no muss no fuss, and no adventure.
