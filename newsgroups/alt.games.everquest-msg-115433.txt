Its seems like the number of initial posts here from people complaining
about a druid, and initial posts from druids complaining about getting tells
for buffs is pretty even.  The whineplay on either side ensues after the
intial posts.

I cant recall any enchanter bitching about getting a request for a buff not
that that means there havent ever been any.

Its all relative, sow isnt important, neither is clarity of haste to be
honest.  They are all buffs of convenience.
