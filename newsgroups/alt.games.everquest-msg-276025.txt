Heck, the pet plus Dark Nightmare (591/tic) will easily break 150 DPS.
A necro in moderate or better Bazaar gear should be able to keep more
than that up.  Played well (med walking when possible, not getting hit,
not constantly recasting rune, etc) you should be able to sustain at
least 200 DPS.

I usually keep around 150 DPS in dots on a mob when soloing.  The pet
is doing at least 50 DPS.  So there's 200+ DPS from a very gimp 67
necro...He has no BA/CA, I think just one point of FT, maybe +8 in HP
regen gear, and 18 AAs.  They don't come much more gimp than this.

If I ever get him geared up better, he would probably be able to
sustain 225, maybe 250 DPS while kiting, I'd guess.
