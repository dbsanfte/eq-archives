I thought the decision to deregulate was made directly by the voters in a
referendum.  Could be wrong though.  Even if I am, the people elect their
leaders, and if the "wrong ones" are elected, the people who didn't vote at
all are as much to blame as the ones who actually voted for the polictician
who won.
