The Gigabyte GA-7DXR uses the AMD 761 northbridge, not a Via northbridge.
I can't speak for the original poster, but I am getting this "infinite loop"
fault too, not as quickly but the same fault and as the northbridge controls
the AGP as part of it's function, it cannot be caused by the via
incompatibility.
