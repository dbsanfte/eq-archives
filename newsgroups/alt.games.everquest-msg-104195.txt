I recently purchased a weapon (adanmite bo stick <sp?>) for my monk, and it
procs a series of 75pt raining effect.  Question is how can I protect myself
better from the damage, as I was taking about 45dmg x3.  I 2box a shammy and
tried a magic buff and fire resist buff to no avail (tried that after
reading on another site).  What is the best way to protect against this?
Otherwise the weapon seems kinda useless.

TIA, Danny
