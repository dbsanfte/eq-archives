Why not try heading along the wall to the right from DSP.  You cross
over one hilltop and end up in a little valley next to some vampire
houses.  (Stay on the wall)  The area is safe, the only danger of adds
is on the pull.  Pally can ITU on the pull to scout things out.  Clear
the coteries (vampires) and you still have lots and lots of undead on
the other side of their outpost in the form of vampire bats and
skeletons.
