Sounds more like an attitude problem than a loot system problem to me.

Why is your LC awarding big upgrades to people not showing up?

First verify *why* they aren't showing up.

No. IMO its not. A good LC should be made aware of his desire for dreamX 
and should act accordingly with other drops; but if minorupgradeY drops 
it shouldn't rot if its an upgrade for him.

LC requires a LC that is intelligent and fair. This is impossible to 
acheive long term. People are people.

Simple DKP is 'fair' but inherently unbalanced. The loot drop 
distribution, and the class makeup of your guild will force some classes 
to 'compete' more for their drops. All/All items will thus be harder for 
some classes to afford than others... etc.

Many guilds have all sorts of contorted dkp rules to try to re-balance 
things, but this is a 'fuzzy' process that I think is generally unfair 
and no better than the simple system. And now it has the opportunity to 
be perverted by greed and favortism just like an LC, but still hides 
behind DKP as an 'objective' loot distribution system when it isn't.
