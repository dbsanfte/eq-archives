Subject: Cheap Haste Items?

Am looking to try and buy something for my 38 pally with some Haste on it.  Any
reccomendations on something to pick up that would be relatively inexpensive. 
I don't really want to go the fbss route since he needs all the AC he can get. 
I'm leaning towards trying to save up for some Silver Chitin Hand Wraps which
go for about 3k on my server.  Any other suggestions?  TIA.
