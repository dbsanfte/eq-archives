Please don't post in HTML. It's annoying and rude.

To your question...

You didn't screw up. You have to specialize in all of them by putting
one point into each if you ever want your primary one to go above 50 and
eventually up to its maximum. So, if you have started them all, and none
are over fifty, just pick a nice level one spell in the area you want to
specialize in and cast it over and over until your spec breaks 50. You
can only have one spec over fifty, so after that you don't have to worry
about it.

The quest is for people who either messed up and picked the wrong one
and took it over fifty, or for people who change their minds later in
their career and want to switch.

Rubies can be had in two ways. You can either hunt for them or buy them.
Rubies are a fairly good cash gem, and don't drop off low level
creatures. I *think* (not sure here.. it's been a while) that I didn't
start getting rubies as drops until we were killing stuff on the order
of Seafury Cyclops and the like. And if you are at a level to just be
setting your specialization, you won't be killing them for a while.

You can buy them off vendors, though. But it wont' be cheap. Save up
your money if you still decide you really need one. You might look in
the bazaar and do a search. Some players are selling most of the
available jewelry trade skill gems (including rubies) for just a smidgen
more than you can get for them from a vendor. You might get lucky there.
