The thing that is missing in DAoC that Everquest has is the variety in
places to visit. I originally started in Albion and would hunt in the Keltoi
dungeon from 15 to about 25. I then got bored and tried out Midgard. They
have an exact replica of Keltoi, but a bit higher lvl. I went in and
IMMEDIATELY could explore the dungeon because they were identical. These are
the things I just flat out can't stand. Even if you switch realms, it's all
the same. Also, while I dislike the extreme amount of downtime in EQ, I
honestly think it leads to a much more social game. Even playing with
friends, DAoC just wasn't as much fun when in all actuality, everything that
I thought I hated about EQ was fixed.
