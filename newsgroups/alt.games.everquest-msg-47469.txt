I do have to agree on you about level 10 for Wisp Island.  Even with a full
group at that level, it would be quite hazardous, to put it mildly.  If he
wants to solo them, it's best if he waits until they're green to him.

But I personally have to say that I loot far more silks per spider from
trips to Wisp Island than on trips to Everfrost.  Maybe it's just been luck
of the draw, or the sheer number of spiders in such a small space that makes
a difference.  I gave up on the Everfrost spiders long ago...far too time
consuming to get enough silks to work on tailoring.

The long and the short of it is, there is no really convenient place for
lower levels to farm spider silks for tailoring purposes in the immediate
Qeynos area.  While it can be done, it is just frustratingly time-consuming
and overly hazardous for the amount of silks you can harvest.

Since he's a druid, traveling to the Commons at level 10 should be no
problem for him, and spider hunting there would be much safer and rewarding
for his level.
