That's accurate and well put.

I would add is that these discussions are often heavily slanted towards
top-end play: most feedback comes from the perspective of heavy-duty players
who consider everything below lvl65 to be warmups for the "real" game. The
class-balance perspective of the 30s or 40s or 50s, of players who see those
levels as a core part of their EQ playing, is often overlooked.

The addition of LDoN changed the equation too, since that brought a
fundamentally new set of grouping conditions into the game.

The summary axis against which to measure the classes for various sorts of
EQ playing is of degree of specialization. Imagine a line with
"SPECIALIZATION" at one end and "VERSATILITY" at the other.

For raiding, specialization is most desired. The raiding party wants pure
tanks with maximum possible AC/HP, epic'ed clerics who will do nothing but
heal and rez, elite nukers who will do nothing but nuke, etc. How well a
class can handle secondary functions isn't relevant in this context.

For soloing, versatility is most desired. The more things a class can do
decently (heal, crowd control, dps, buff, etc.) the better a soloing class
it will be, even if it doesn't do any one of those things as well as some
other class could.

General experience grouping is somewhere in the middle, but biased a bit
towards the specialization end of this spectrum. One reason is because a
group in an open zone can get help from others outside the group, like some
buffage every so often, maybe some healing help in a moment of crisis, etc.
They can also live without some particular group function (mezzing of adds,
say) if they have a zoneline to escape to when things go awry.

LDoN adventuring, though, is closer to the versatility end. Groups really
need to have all or most of the basic group functions covered at least
minimally, so having a DPS class that can also do some buffing or healing is
valuable. Or a tank that can also help with crowd control (paladins with
pacify). Etc.

I'm not yet clear on how GoD instanced-grouping fits in or how popular it
will prove to be. And the next expansion could introduce some new way of
playing with a new set of demands.

Whichever of these perspectives most fits your personal EQ lifestyle will
naturally lead your perception of class balance. I'm primarily a soloer and
LDON adventurer, so I see versatile classes as the most valuable. Players
working towards Plane of Time will naturally see maxed-out specialization as
the definition of class power. Etc.
