I went to bind an Iksar once.  As I was meming the spell, a guard had been
pulled out and went to attack him.  He used Feign Death.  The guard
proceeded to attack me.  I have had invisible/in wall mobs attack me after
the person in my group they were attacking has used FD, gate, or zoned.

These things are not supposed to happen, but they sometimes do.  So why
should I invite the risk by accepting a blind invite?  Also, if they attack
guard and cast a helper spell on me, will that pop up the guards aggro?
Don't know.  But still, why take the chance?

I don't want to fight the guards.  Have no reason to.  I also don't want to
have to run to the zone.  I don't always have SoW on, and would lay odds
that the guards would stun me.

So perhaps the possibility of XP loss, Faction loss and time loss are what I
am avoiding.  Did you think of that before asking a stupid question?
