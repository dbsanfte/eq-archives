Precisely (sp?) my point.  If you *DON'T* enjoy the character, it becomes 
a serious challenge to even play.  If you *DO* enjoy the character, you 
can't (seem) to get enough playing in.

At least, that's the way I see it.  Now, if I only had more time that I 
*COULD* play, Miznit would be higher still (dinged 40 over the weekend, 
WOOT!).

Miznit, 40 Wizard, E'ci
