And I would like to see some policy changes that make enjoying EQ
simpler and more affordable for single people.  Its good to have wants. 
We all should have em.  I'm sure that a system where families got a
discount and single folks got a discount would work out great for
everyone but VI's accountants who tally the bottom line, but one where
my full price fee is used to subsidize your children's discounted
accounts might raise some issues.  Either you can afford it or you can't
and if you can't then don't.

t" wont someone please think of the children!?!"h
