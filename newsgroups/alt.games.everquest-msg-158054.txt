Well, one of the problems is that everyone opinions are based on a Halfling
Druid, with their Wis score maxed out.  If I remember right, the "soloing
yellows" phase are just around when a Druid gets SOW.  (Was that 14?  or
19?)  This is before bookless medding and I'm a Half Elf, so med kiting
wasn't an option for me, and being un-twinked, I just never had the mana to
pull it off.  Only a Druid that is MAXED out on Wis and/or twinked could do
this from what I could see.

I COULD barely take on White opponents, and this lasted about 6-8 levels if
I remember right.

In fact, the fact that I don't see Druids as much or any easier may be due
to the fact that I have an AVERAGE Druid, not an uber Dr00d of JUST the
right race, and maxed out on Wisdom...
