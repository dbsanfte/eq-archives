The difference is that one is being prepared for the mob's *abilities*
versus exploiting the game engine's limitations.

Now, if Verant had deliberately made all Vampiric mobs (lichs, etc) to be
unable to cross running water (classic vampire limitation) then I would
consider THIS move to make perfect sense.  It doesn't fit the profile for
99% of the mobs, so would be "just another pathing exploit" here.
