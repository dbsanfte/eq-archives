*embarassed mutter* That editing was a mistake, if you saw my later email.
I didn't do it on purpose, honest!

And merging without regard for existing traffic is also failure to yield
right of way.  How is turning right on red when you have an opening
different from merging when you have an opening?  Either way, if you try
to occupy the same space as a car in moving traffic you aren't yielding
right of way.

I'm rather confused what you are trying to argue Bizbee.  At first I
thought you were disagreeing with me, but then in later emails you've
started to argue that you agree with me.

You are one confusing "usenet maverick who wears a 14 year old flameboi
suit".  *shake head*
