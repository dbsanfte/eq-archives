Hi All;

I'm fairly new to EQ and have a question.  I'm a cleric and was helping a
friend do a CR and going over an area that levitate would be most helpful.
There were a couple of players near the area and I Hailed them asking if
they had levitate. One came over and cast a spell. But, I didn't start to
float. So I said that levitate didn't take hold on me. He said look in your
inventory. I did, and there was a red ring. He said right click on it and I
would levitate. I then asked how many times this would work and he said 2. I
thanked him and went on my way.

My question: I don't remember accurately, but I think he was a Beastlord or
some similar race.

What race, class, level can cast a ring with 2 levitate charges?
Can these stack or can you have more than 1 ring in your inventory?
Do these use a component to cast?
Are these No Rent?  This happened last night and I haven't logged back in to
see if it is still there, since I only used 1 charge.

Thank you in advance for your time.
