Well, a stray regrowth or chloroblast would take care of that. Also, a
dire charmed pet will allow me to hunt in areas I can't do reliably
now, and I wouldn't have to keep the pet snared (security measure.
Actually, I epic dot/snare my pets...)

That's exactly what I do. However, up till now I have been breaking
the pet charm before the other mob dies (even if the pet is winning),
and I have been taking measures to kill the former pet first 'just in
case'. I won't have to do that anymore.
