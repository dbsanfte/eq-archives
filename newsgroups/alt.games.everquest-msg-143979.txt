Let me say again, I'm talking about a system based on pure capitalism
here, not necessarily a hybrid system like we have today.

That said, when left to fate and "market forces", the rich only tend
to get richer and the poor poorer.  I keep bringing up the industrial
revolution because it was, I feel, as close to a "pure" capitalistic
economy that the US has ever been too.

Anyway, while there are tails of people bootstrapping themselves up
through the economic strata, it was a rarer occurrence than it's made
out to be.  The rich tended to protect their wealth and avoid letting
it trickle down.  Understandable, but bad for the whole.

Had they been willing to share a little bit more, there would have
been no need for the creation of things like labor unions.

And before this starts, we can argue the need for labor unions today,
but at the time they were indeed a necessity.

I belong to a union and near as I can see, and today, it tends to end
up hurting itself more often than not.

I agree totally.  But I think one of the most important things any
governmental/economic system should do is minimize the negative
effects that come with it.  I don't care if you are a CEO, you should
be treated the same way under the law.  And it DOESN'T happen that way
now.  Money will buy you a better defense, and that isn't right, I'm
sorry.  This is a larger problem than what we're talking about though,
even if it is related.

The fact that the middle class WASN'T as affluent as it is now is an
important point though.  Much, much too much of the wealth was only
living at the upper end of the social spectrum.  It was easier to get
away with it 100 years ago too because America wasn't a total consumer
culture the way it is now.

No thank you.  :-)  And I've heard all the horror stories.  My dad did
what sounds to be your job about 35 years ago.

But as bad as it is for you, imagine how hard it would be for a 13
year old down there, for 12 hours a day with no breaks.

"Poison"?  Wasn't I criticized earlier for using the word "caste" to
bias?  :-)

Amen brother.

I think it's a good intermingling of the two, which was kind of my
point.  Hybrid systems are better than pure systems.  By no means
perfect, but stronger.

The ability to use your wealth is, IMHO, limited by your intelligence.
GETTING money though, can be a different story.

Example:  Microsoft and pretty much any small, third party software
developer that they've swallowed up in the last 10ish years.

And before you start, I don't think Microsoft is the great satan that
many seem to.  I don't think they play fair though.

True, and like I said, a society should be designed to make that
stratification as fluid(?) as possible.

What right does government have to force me to follow traffic laws?

Ask United Blood Services how much you can depend on the charity of
others.  Outside of notable events (9/11), they usually have to beg,
plead, and cajole people to be charitable.  And then they still come
up short.

Example of how it should work.  As I think I mentioned before, we
recently had a nice big layoff where I work.  A friend of mine whom I
still talk too got the axe.  The first day he was unemployed, he did
indeed file for unemployment, he has kids and the job market in
Phoenix isn't all that great right now.  Still, two weeks later he did
indeed have a new job.  People like that is what I think things like
unemployment benefits were designed for.

Granted, for every guy like that, there is someone else like another
guy I know who gets laid off, and goes on unemployment so he can smoke
pot and play Playstation 24-7.

Like I said, how do you make a system that people can't take advantage
of though?

Actually, didn't Clinton get elected when he admitted up front that
taxes would probably have to be increased?

I would look it up myself, but I'm an hour late on starting my EQ time
right now as it is. :-)
