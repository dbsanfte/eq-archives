Hmm, one source suggests that it does -not- stun  but rather
"interrupts spell casting"

If that effect works on unstunnable mobs, this is suddenly not such
an awful spell after all, although I'd sure like to see it -not- be AOE
-not- be damage, -not- be PB, and -not- blind, oh, and for good measure
not cost 427 mana for an effect I usually get with a 35 mana cost stun

Oh, and the "almost always resisted" part... if they are looking for
a stun effect and it doesn't actually do that, perhaps its not being
resisted
after all?
