Yes, but it's still too long. Even something that is trivial is still
going to take you 25-30 seconds to create. This is just too long to
pump out raw materials which you need en mass.

This is how it should be:

Trivial: 1 second
Extremely Difficult: 60 seconds

I'm sick of going down there to make a few items and it taking me an
hour and a half.

They also need to put a bank in the tradeskill zones.

I had a whole list of things that I thought needed changing that would
improve tradeskills but i've lost it. 

Cheers,
