What exact benefit would uber guilders and SOE employees receive from
having these spells when they shouldn't?  I understand that they can
then mass imbue gems that they shouldn't be mass imbuing, but is there
some quest or tradeskill item that I'm missing that requires multiple
imbued gems that uber guild members would be interested in
doing/having?

I've got most of the imbue spells from the first time around and on
very rare occasions have I ever bothered to use any of them.  Some I
have never used.

How exactly can I benefit from imbuing stacks of black pearls beyond
selling them to the only grandmaster Erudite tailor on the server, who
can pretty much set his price?
