If it means the same thing in Diablo 2 as it does in EQ, then yes.

How many accounts are you willing to pay for?

> - is pvp possible ?

Yes

Not to the best of my knowledge.

> - is it possible to solo ?

Absolutely, some classes much more so than others.

etc.

Thankfully, yes.

You can keep things in a bank, it has 8 slots in it that can each hold a
single item.  Each of those items can in turn be a container, containers in
EQ can hold from 4 to 10 items.  This allows you up to 80 slots in the bank
for items.  You can also keep cash in the bank.
