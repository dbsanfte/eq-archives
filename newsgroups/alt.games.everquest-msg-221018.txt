Your "source" was the British crime SURVEY. It wasn't police records.
I have another Survey from the Home Office that stated over 61,000
women were raped in 1999 in England. So which set of numbers is right?
Was 1999 just a bumper year for rape? Are women who are asked in the
survey if they were raped ashamed to admit it? Either way, the numbers
aren't valid.

The two "surveys"

I did. Even if you are correct, which I'm not sure you are, based on
the two conflicting reports I got from the Home Office site, the rate
of rape in Englad has grown astronomically. If you are correct, the
rate of rape in the US is 3X that of England's. If The other survey is
right... well... You do the math.

The rate of rape in the US was 16X that of England's in 1986. It's at
most 3X England's now... So even if you're correct, you won't be long.
