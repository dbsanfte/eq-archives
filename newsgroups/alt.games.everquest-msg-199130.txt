With my bard charm kiting, I will charm one, send it off on another and 
have a seat. Yeah, I'm lazy, I know. When the charm wears off, I merely 
stand up and start backpedalling, waiting on the song, which I never 
stopped, to kick in again, at which point I click the attack button to 
send my pet back at the target, which I kept targetted throughout.

When the pet box disappears, that forces me to quickly locate that /pet 
attack button when it reappears, rather than keeping my cursor poised 
over it ready to click it again all while avoiding two an.

Trivial concern, really, until I experience a little lag. Then it's a 
pain.
