Ack. That's what I get for cutting and pasting and not proof reading.
It's the lack of being able to use your environment to your advantage
that really ticked me off with EQ. However the inability of a low
level PC to be useful to a high level group is the biggest failing
that all MMORPGs suffer from. Some have tried to limit the problem
some what, but it's an inherent flaw in all level based RPG systems.
(Not just on the computer.)
