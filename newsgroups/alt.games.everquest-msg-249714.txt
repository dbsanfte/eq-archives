You missed what they'd really do.  You think drop rates on some things
suck now?  Wait until SoE's able to *charge* you for the items.

Drop rates go through the floor, and if you want to get the Ring off
the Ancient Cyclops any time before Doomsday, just pony up a few

will you pay for a Windblade when the drop rate falls below one every
250 kills of whatever mob drops it?
