Dont go exploring unless you like dying. Easier to check up on these zones
on web sites, in which case you would know not to go to lesser fay. Also
posting questions here is an excellent way to learn the ropes. If you dont
know anyone much, and its your first character, then I'd suggest starting
off a druid. Best character for learning the game imo. Its not you, I think
we all found it pretty tough with our first characters.
