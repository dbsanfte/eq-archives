    Yes. Supposedly you can choose a colour on the beard too when you create
a character. I wouldn't know, as not only am I stuck with the one colour
(dirty old man grey), but changing over to the bearded face changed my face
in the "old graphics" to a non-bearded face and I can't change that back. So
most of the people that see me (most people I know don't use the new models
because they blow) think that I shaved, which is sacriledge.

    Two. Blonde hair/beard, and brown hair/beard. As a (former) member of
the hair club for women, trust me on this. My three dwarf characters are
sisters, and the third (the warrior) has a massive chip on her shoulder
because she is unbearded and her two sisters are bearded and teased her for
being ugly.

    One bard in my guild was inactive for a while when I was recruited, then
came back. Her first words to me were, "Yes, I remember seeing you around.
Your face gave me the creeps."
