Greetings all!!

Im hoping that someone out there in NG Land will know where A Grul Baku
Jewler spawns. Im trying to help a nero friend out to get her Twilight Cloak
One of the Pieces needed is a miniature armband that drops off of the
Jeweler. Weve tried locating her in Tenubrous, and in Twilight Sea, both
with no success. I used my Druid to track, and never once saw that mob pop
up on the Track.

So... is there somthing that we need to do to trigger a spawn, or are we
looking in the wrong places or is this simply a VERY rare random spawn mob ?

Any help anyone can provide is greatly appreciated!!
