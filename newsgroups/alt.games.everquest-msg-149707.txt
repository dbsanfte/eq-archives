I'm not sure we are on the same page.

I never ever have any trouble posting a link.  Works like a charm
every time... on my screen.  And many people can read my links
just fine.  Problem I and others are having that I'm talking about
here is in reading the links of others.

I'm saying that if You post a link that reads

/ooc hey don't you wish you had a Greater Light Stone

I will see

Ryou says in out of character "hey don't you wish you had a 98780Greater Light
Stone"

and if I click on 98780Greater Light Stone

I'll see the description of a Harvester of Lost Toast or something equally
silly,
if anything at all.. if the link is even blue.

but if you post

/ooc Greater Light Stone is sure a great drop

I'll read

Ryou says in out of character "Greater Light Stone is sure a great drop"

And I"ll be able to get the correct description of the GLS every time.
