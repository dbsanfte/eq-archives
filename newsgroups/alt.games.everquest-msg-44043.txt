Bind Potion would also work, say make it shaman produced, run about 20pp
each in ingrediants.. this isn't like SOW potions which you are going to consume

in bulk, after all, but needs to be cheap enough that relatively low levels can
afford to use it.  Hmmm, nah, I'm trying to fix that economically and it isn't
coming out right, want low levels to be able to use (20pp too much) and high
levels not to use casually (20pp way too cheap.)  Ah, non stackable, lore, thats

the answer to that problem.  Cheap enough for anyone to afford em, but you
can't carry around a bunch of em.

Caster Mobs should have appropriate mana pools, HP, AC, and damage
for their class and level.  Near infinite mana, tank almost as good as
melee mobs, and some slammin channeling skill levels too... if that was
a character class the nerf stick would be hitting it fast and furious.

Nah, by this time porters have group port and evac spells, those
exits aren't intended for use.

Aye, there are some missing items out there, and some other items that seem
pretty easy for how good they are.  Adamantine Epolettes, for example,
are crazy good for the little froggie that drops em, and then you won't see
anything better for ages.
