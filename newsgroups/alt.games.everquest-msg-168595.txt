But that's the thing, there was a healthy private enterprise during the 
Third Reich. Of course, much of the industrial production was dictated 
by the state as per the war needs, but that's only understandable. I'm 
not much up to speed on the ownership of the actual means of production, 
but as far as I remember, there was no mass nationalization of assets, 
unless you were Jewish, of course.

A Third Reich at peace would probably have been much like Pinochet's 
Chile, a capitalist dictatorship.
