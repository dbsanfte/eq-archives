4 characters over level 30, not counting the level 50 character. 3
characters between level 20 and 30. Countless others of levels ranging
from 1-20. And all the other characters were made and levelled to 20+
before the level 50 was even 40... I have always played a multitude of
characters, it's not an issue of "deciding I wanted to play another
character" after I hit 50.

So, why don't you just crawl back under your rock like a good little
roach and quit acting like some all-knowing guru and start acting like
the clueless little twit that you are.
