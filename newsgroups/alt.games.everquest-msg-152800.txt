}Is it possible to shut down EQ while AFK?

Well... you can be in trader mode while sitting...  How about a hotkey that 
does

/pause a_very_big_number
/camp desktop 

There's probably a limit on how big that can be... but you could 

/pause a_very_big_number
/pause a_very_big_number
/pause a_very_big_number
/pause a_very_big_number
/camp desktop

Alternately, just hotkey /camp desktop and put your keyboard next to a beam 
balance with something sticking out to hit the key with a beaker on one side 
that's slowly being filled from a leaking tap, and counterweights on the 
other.  I love Rube Goldberg, he's my hero.
