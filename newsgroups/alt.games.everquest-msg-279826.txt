Indeed, by happy circumstance it does.  That's why I'm paying attention
to what you're saying. :)

What I mean is, I know things that let me be more efficient.  Instead
of hunting in, say, Nek Forest, I know the newbie yard in Qeynos has
mobs *blue to a level 4* that regularly drop items that vendor very
well, for the level.  Even besides the occasional >1plat rat tail, you
can get stackable drops that sell for ~2 gold each.  That's a lot of
money, at that level.  I've used it on several alts to be able to
afford vendor-bought backpacks early.  I know where to go to get the
Iksar Berserker Club, for example, which is an extremely good weapon
(7/18 ! ) for the stage in the game at which you can kill for it.
These things put you ahead of someone who, say, just kills in their
race's newbie zone then wanders over to the next one and blithely sees
what's there.  I'm sure you can do the same things.

I understand.  That's why I hope I was clear that this was an
independent, although similar, experience.  I'm not claiming to be your
advance scouting party. :)

What about hunting for a specific drop?  What about preferring to hunt
mobs that you know drop better loot?  Would you refuse to hunt hill
giants with a level appropriate group?  I see this guild doing lots of
targeted hunting.  I'd bet you're going to have regular raids on Unrest
in your 20's, for example, to get upgrades.  Your magician will be
begging you to hunt in Najena for the focus item drops.  The list goes
on. :)

I'm saying that I know *level-appropriate* ways to make relatively
decent money.  I'm not sure how that, in itself, runs counter to your
goals.  What I think we're exploring right now is what you would
consider appropriate ways to spend that money.  I think we agree that
buying a drop from a mob many levels above you runs counter to your
goals.

Yes, I agree.  This runs counter to what you are trying to achieve.
Heck, it runs counter to what I am trying to do, too.  I admitted to a
moment of weakness.  :)

It seems to me that the evil is not so much in making money but in how
easy it is to "abuse" it in the bazaar.  Personally, I sometimes enjoy
playing the market - it can be a game unto itself, and it works because
I *know* something.  I could as easily be reselling spiderling silk,
which anyone can acquire.  Then I turn around and buy a drop from a
critter 15 levels above me, and there the problem happens, to my way of
thinking.  I would like to hear your perspective.  Certainly, it is
easier to avoid temptation by not amassing lots of money in the first
place, and this may be your point.  Again, the money required for your
basic needs (food, spells, etc.) is quite modest.  A question now being
adressed is, is there any point in having more?  If I wanted to be
provocative, I might argue that having unspendable money is also a
busted economy. :)

The quest to get started on the basic armor can be done in the mid
teens.  The journeyman (lowest level) armor combines have trivials
around 120-140, and they are required level 15, recommended level 20.
This is fairly daunting tradeskill range for a low level character to
achieve, but possible.  The quest for the journeyman level
augmentations requires about level 20 or 25 and the augs take
jewelcraft around 60 to make reliably.  The gear is decent for the
level.  Honestly, I haven't checked thoroughly how it stands up against
what else you can "honestly" hunt at that level.  Certainly, it isn't
bad gear.  It is at least competitive with or better than the old
newbie quest armors, in terms of stats, and the AC is better.  The
expert gear is required 35, recommended 40 with trivials in the 180-220
range.  This would be fairly difficult for a level 40 to achieve.
Remember we're talking about smithing and tailoring here, not brewing.
:)  A level appropriate character, dedicated to the appropriate
tradeskill, could probably attempt the combines with a decent, but far
from certain chance of success.  If you want this gear, you will need
some serious (for the level) money and/or component farming to fund
your tradeskilling.  Is this a bad thing?  A downside for the guild
would be that the DoN cultural armor is race-specific.  My hypothetical
troll SK/smith could make nice armor for a troll shaman or troll
warrior, but the dwarf would have to settle for banded.

Oh, I wouldn't mind making it for guildies at cost, or thereabouts.
What would get me excited is actually making something that someone
would wear before having a tradeskill over 250. :)  I can't think of a
single thing fitting that description since my first character made a
10% WR backpack, and raising tradeskills involves a LOT of successful
combines...  Wait, I take that back - I did eat some long-since-trivial
baking foods as novelty items.  I also used some Wu's armor to twink a
new beastlord, which lasted until about level 10.  :)  Working under
constraints like this would be a paradise for a tradeskiller.  I
suggest that's a good thing, at least for tradeskills.

Indeed.  Looting, rather than buying, upgrades is more fun.  My main's
most treasured pieces are the ones he looted, and they aren't
necessarily the best pieces.
