That's, actually, rather interesting to me. I've never heard of anyone,
myself included, making that distinction. I think, too, that that's
probably why so many of these threads in here get out of hand; because
we have tons of people just defending themselves to the point that the
original purpose of the thread is completely lost over what is often a
minor misunderstanding. Interesting...
