OK so it's still early to speculate and whatnot.  But a lot of the talk has
been about porting over characters from EQ1 and such.  WHAT IF they had a
server (or servers, as demand dictates) where there are no NEW characters
created, but you can port over your EQ chars.  You can bring in whatever
levels you want (1, 15, 45, 60, whatever), and however many you want,  and
MAYBE after a time new chars could be put on the server.  But the point is
you could use your old characters with the new engine and new world, see the
new world, get the new items, etc without losing all time time on your EQ
characters.   Admittedly, the economy would not be good, and god only knows
what grouping and levelling would be like BUT you could experience EQ2
without losing your friends and such.
