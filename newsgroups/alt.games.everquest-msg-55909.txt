BTW, I don't make it a point to look for your posts & read them.  Putting
in, "Once again:" implies that for some reason you felt that I should have
read a previous post when most of the time I haven't found much in your
posts that interest me.

And yeah, after that first encounter when I ooc'd that I was less than
thrilled with this event people pointed it out to me.  That only made me
Gate that much sooner.
