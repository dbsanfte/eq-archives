I can not agree more. One of the craziest exp grinding groups I ever
was in consisted of me (cleric), a shaman, a ranger, a monk, and an
enchanter puller. The enchanter would have 4-5 low blues lined up
while the damage dealers beat on one, the shaman kept them buffed
and speeded and the mob slowed (actually, I don't think he bothered
with slow, those low blues were dropping so fast it was probably not
needed), and I tossed them a rare heal. I also helped the enchanter
out, stunning mobs that resisted mez, and keeping track of which mob
had the oldest mez. The exp was amazing!

We were all around 40, and this was in Iceclad, the mobs in question
being dire wolves and the occational snow derv, btw. It was great
fun being surrounded by wolves while beating them up one at a time!
