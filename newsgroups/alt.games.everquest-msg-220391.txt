Hey all. I bugged those in channel last night with this, and I didn't 
want the rest of you to feel left out. :)

I'm going to roll up a rogue alt. First off, I know other classes have 
certain issues like picking the right deity to be eligible for certain 
gear, concentrating on a certain stat on creation (sta/str for rogue?) 
and such.

I played a human rogue to 20-ish before, and really enjoyed it. The 
creeping around dangerous areas was a rush sometimes. I detested the 
night-blindness though, especially on corpse runs. I could sneak in to 
drag my corpse out, if I could find it, that is. Obviously there are 
other factors, but I've listed below the main points I'm considering for 
each race. If there is something you feel is a big benefit/disadvantage 
for one, please mention it:

Barbarian - 
GOOD: best STR for backstab max damage, good race
BAD: night blind, large size, a barbarian rogue?!

Dark Elf -
GOOD: sees at night, looks pretty cool
BAD: WEAK stats, evil race

Dwarf -
GOOD: great overall stats, sees at night, good race
BAD: a dwarven rogue?!

Gnome -
GOOD: sees at night, good race, tinkering(rogue-usable?)
BAD: WEAK stats

Half Elf -
GOOD: sees at night, good race
BAD: mediocre stats, no culture(matters?)

Halfling -
GOOD: great overall stats, good race
BAD: Well, they're halflings. I don't bash them too much, but they are 
still quite the cliche.

Human -
GOOD: Decent stats, good race, looks cool
BAD: night blind

Vah Shir - for some reason I have zero desire to play that race. No idea 
why.

Wood Elf -
GOOD: sees at night, good race
BAD: WEAK stats

I guess I'm leaning toward human again, but am hoping someone can talk me 
out of it.  :)

Regarding servers, I have old characters on Saryrn (36 druid is highest 
there, though)and therefore a good bit of twink resources, but I never 
really got into a groove where I would regularly hook up with good people 
like I have on FV. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you 
look at it) I can only have one character on FV, so I have to decide 
whether to roll on Saryrn where my money is, or find a different server.

Any input on either of these topics would be much appreciated.
