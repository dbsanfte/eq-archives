Why, it's the Plane of Mana, of course.  It's a high-end zone with an
insanely-high mana regen rate that's set up to allow wizards to AE group,
and druids to quad-kite to their heart's content.  Hell, KEI isn't even
needed there, since you can med from OOM to FM in a single potty break.  If
you've got a horse, your mana bar stays pretty much pegged on full.

Unfortunately, it still doesn't effect Bard's mana.  Bastards.
