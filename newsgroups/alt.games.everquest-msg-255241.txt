Note how "exactly what Moopy described" ("when you're not focused don't
render 3d") is described as "MMOTools subscribers can take advantage of the
"Rendering" settings, which allow background sessions to have a HIGHER
framerate than the foreground, while using LESS processing time."

As in, "MMOTools subscribers"...

As in, now you have to pay...

Since Moopy specifically commented on "the rendering part", your claim that
it has never been relevant to this discussion is laughable.

Also, contrary to your assertion that the rendering part is only useful to
people who are multiboxing, a little common sense leads to the conclusion
that if it helps performance while multiboxing, it will help performance
while surfing the web, watching porn, or whatever else you might want to do
with EQ in the background.
