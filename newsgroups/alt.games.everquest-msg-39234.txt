Platinum diamond? The diamond wedding band has 5 wis, 5 int, 15 mana,
8 fire and 8 cold. I'd like to get a wedding band to replace one of my
plat jasper rings if I can and otherwise get jewelcrafted diamond
rings for resists.

Another thing I'm wanting... I have a kunzar cloak now, same wis and
10 fire.

I have one of the components (the tree sap) but too chicken to go near
dragon land yet.

Check.

I recently bought a crystalline eye, 10 fire/cold/magic, but I keep it
banked most of the time. And my dark ember has +7 fire.

Heh, I still wear plat armbands. I considered getting withered leather
sleeves this week, but decided I didn't like the guy selling them (his
guild is selling transportation to PoMischief for 50k a pop now that
they're mostly done with EQ...)
Been considering getting hollowed bone bracers for the 7MR, but can't
be bothered - my bank is full enough as it is.

Considering you could have problems getting a blue diamond for 2k, I'd
definitely say so!

I'm thinking about getting an Othmir fur cap for head (6 wis and a
small save cold) and want blue diamond earrings and bracers more than
the tiara. Earrings are probably the slot I'd be most likely to
permanently swap in resist gear.

Heck, at 40 the *only* resist I had was 5 extra poison from my gnome
skin boots and 10 extra fire from the kunzar cloak (I finally have GE,
but I want coldain skin). Now I am at 50 fire, 36 cold and 28 magic
with my regular stuff, and can make that 60/49/55. Not much, but it's
a start.

Ulthork tusks are nerfed? I'll save up the one tusk I have for the 7th
shawl then :)
