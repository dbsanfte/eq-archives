Alternately, if you are looking for an 'Old World' zone to level up in, Field
of Bone is good into your teens...  :)

I hate PC.  I know the xp there is insane, but I end up there in my early 20's
doing bandits...  I don't want to spend my toddler and teen years there too... 
LOL  People tend to be very /ooc stupid and so forth.

Just me though...  But yeah, stay out of GFay hon, no reason for you to be
there.  Can't kill enough orcs to matter with the elves and can't get into
Thurg to turn in belts and pads for same sort of racial faction reasons.
