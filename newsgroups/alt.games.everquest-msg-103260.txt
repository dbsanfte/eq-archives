The displayed ATK increase for STR increase is way out of line with its
actual effect, which is a small increase in maximum damage, producing
an even smaller increase in average damage over a fight.  You are still
under L40 and so you haven't hit your pre-L51 offensive skills caps yet.
When you are, oh let's say L48, and you have not seen an increase in
Offense since L40 nor in your weapon skills since L39, you will likely
be a lot more interested in anything that increases your chance to score
a hit.  Hit frequency matters more to agro than damage, any boost to
your hit frequency is very worthwhile if your goal is to gain and hold
agro.  With my Paladin, if I am using a fast one-hander on the same mob
a Warrior is using a slow two-hander, I can hold agro in spite of the
fact that the Warrior is outdamaging me by a substantial margin.  Same
Warrior, same mob, give the Warrior a pair of fast one-handers and give
me a two-hander, and I'll be spending a lot of mana if I want to gain
or hold agro even tho now my damage output is much closer to the
Warrior's.

Of course, if I'm in a fight against a challenging mob and we've got
a Warrior for an MT I _want_ him to hold agro, unlike some of the idiots
I've observed recently when playing my Warrior alt.  Some of my best
friends are Rangers (bet you've heard that one before), and I've long
since tired of fools who just "know" that a Ranger can't tank.  But I've
seen more stupid Rangers lately than ever before, morons who draw agro
deliberately and then start ranting about their "uber" gear (gear
inferior to my twink's decidedly non-"uber" stuff, btw) when I say:
"/g [idiotsnamehere] please let me tank, it's what I'm good at"
I'm guessing that most of these bozos are (or ought to be) members of
OverNukersAnonymous with their mains.

Hrmm, guess that's enough rambling for today.
