I do.

Unless you're a tracker, forget about it completely.

If you're a tracker (or have access to one), make several mules and
collect all the pieces you can find. After several weeks solid farming,
you could probably make half a dozen pieces of armour, totally random
class and slot, and of dubious resale value - certainly less than if
you'd spent that time farming something else.

I've got about 60 quest pieces gathered by chance or from running a
tracker around when I was bored. Not even got the pieces to make one
single piece of armour yet (:o/
