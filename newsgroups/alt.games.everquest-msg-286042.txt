What "EQ section" are you talking about?  I'm looking at the updates
since the 1st of May and I see a page of updated quests, items,
scenery, bestiary etc?  Not bad going for a 1999 game IMO or are you
expecting the volume of 'new' items to match WoW or Vanguard
proportions somehow?

The Veterans Lounge on the official board seems busy enough.

Of course most of the actual interesting stuff goes on the class
boards.  You have The Spirit Realm, EQ Outrider, Monkly Business, The
Steel Warrior, The Runes, The Druids Grove, The Safehouse, Evilgamer
and other class boards  still providing more than enough reading for
any sane person to be able to keep up with.

I think most servers still have active message boards  as well.
