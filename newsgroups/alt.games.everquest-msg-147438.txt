Just like our goverment is now responsible to the american people,
corporations are responsible for their actions to their owners. Both sets of
people would prefer not to know what is going on and both sets are
ultimately responsible for their actions.

Of course then again for the exxon valdez im fairly sure that drunken
sailing was not part of policy. We all of course recognize that companies
are completely responsible for whatever their employees do even when it is
NOT policy.
