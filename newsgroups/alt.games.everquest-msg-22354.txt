Got the same problem in Canada.  Called up the cable company and they 
said the same thing.

... of course, they ALSO told me that it was my fault for going on during 
'peak' playing times, even though I'd just finished telling them "I got 
on in the morning, and the lag was horrible.  So I went offline and came 
back around noon.  Still bad.  Got off, came back in the afternoon.  
Terrible lag.  Gave up and came back at night ... I still can't play 
because I'm going linkdead constantly.  What's the problem?"

"It's not us, it's them!"

I swear, if they ever learn another phrase, it's going to be something 
like "It's not us, it's the magic elves."
