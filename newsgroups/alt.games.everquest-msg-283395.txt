Well, I get the no LDoN, no Nexus, no Vah Shir and no Iksar part.  But 
why no BL or 'Zerkers?  Those aren't classes that are only available in 
parts of the world (or offworld) which aren't in the original 
territories.   Ogres, Trolls, and Barbarians can be beastlords, and 
berserkers the same plus dwarves, IIRC.

Also you don't mention Frogloks.  Again, my assumption is that they will 
be in, because they are based in Rathe Mountains, which is an original 
zone.  They could roll RM back to its original status, but will they?

Interesting point, although I've come to the conclusion that most of the 
newbie armor wasn't really worth bothering with, its probably still 
better than the summoned stuff.  I was thinking mostly in terms of the 
summoned jewelry, though, which gives focus effects; with the popular 
POP quests absent, this stuff will become a lot more valuable, I'd think.

There are advantages for melee classes that weren't in the game 
originally, too, for one thing, sitting hp regen is tons better than it 
used to be, for another, they have those funky, er, forget the name, 
feats or something, like a low level self heal, and throw stones, and so on.

Maybe we should try and set up an AGE guild, if enough people are going 
to give it a try... I've heard quite a few people saying they're 
thinking of returning to the game just for this.

I decided I didn't really enjoy duoing, and I'm not willing to start 
another second account for what I did end up doing, which was running a 
second character just for the buffs.  This means I'm wondering what 
single character to start.

On the one hand, I really enjoy grouping, but on the other, its a pain 
in the butt to have to hang out LFG half my play time, so I'd like 
something that solos well.  Bard is right out, I've played two now and 
have really concluded that it simply hurts my wrist too much... even 
with Melody, its a constant clickfest.
