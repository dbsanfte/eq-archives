That's a good question.  

<tangent>
Is that why people assume that my husband would lie to me when he says 
he find the new models ugly ... because they see the new models as more 
sexual, and hence assume a guy who doesn't like them is not being 
honest?  I've been perplexed by why I got so many comments when I 
mentioned my husband, and I guess this explains it.  Sheesh, you 
ninnies...if my husband wasn't ashamed to beg me to have my dark elf 
warrior wear low-ac leather-look pants so he could appreciate the "blue 
butt", I don't think he'd bother lying about thinking luclin era models 
are butt-ugly in some cases.

/laments the loss of being able to wear plate while looking like you 
were wearing spandex...ahh, the good old days.

But to answer your question, I suppose halfling/gnome/dwarf women are 
more attractive than they used to be, though you still have to be able 
to appreciate matronly women to some degree.  Ok, I guess they don't 
count as absurdly sexually drawn.
