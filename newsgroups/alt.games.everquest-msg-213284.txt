    You don't have a different AA that does the same, but to your group
instead of to a single target, which makes the first AA obsolete. We do.

    WoR: 1100 mana for 2500 damage healed, HUGE aggro.
    EE: 975 mana for 1200 damage healed over time, little to no aggro.

    I choose life. For me, that is.

    Um, anything that does over 325 (CR + Blessing of Replenishment) per

    It wasn't special before, either. A cleric could always MGB EE. 250/tick
for five ticks versus 300/tick for four ticks making a raid happen? We've
had clerics who are in the CH chain do MGB EE if it needed doing!
