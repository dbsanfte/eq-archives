Okay, still not convinced that LOIO yields any greater exp than other zones, 
I 
did some digging on the 'net. I came across the following page that lists 
ShowEQ zone exp data, and is *current*:

http://eqzem.cjb.net/

Interestingly enough, it shows that Lake of Ill Omen has a 0% zone exp 
modifier. Now, before someone says "but it's a newbie zone, it has a higher 
base exp modifier"...

It also says that LOIO was NERFED on 2/21/01.

To me this means it USED to be higher, and now it's not. I've only been in 
LOIO since maybe the end of February, so I think my hunch was right. You 
don't 
get extra experience for hunting there. Not that it's a bad zone with 
plentiful mobs roaming about - but it's not the "be all and end all" of EQ 
zones.

Of course, people will still flock there by the hundreds. <sigh>
