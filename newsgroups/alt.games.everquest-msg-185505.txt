Things to check...

In EQ:
1. Textrue Compression = ON
2. Texture Cache = ON
3. Verify that you both have the same "Quality" settings (low, medium,
high)
4. Verify that you are both running the same color depth (16bit or
32bit)
5. Make sure you are both running the same resolution when testing

In Windows:
1. Defrag all drives
2. Check Desktop color depth (16bit, or 32bit)
3. Make sure you are both running the same versions of the NVidia
Drivers, and DirectX
4. Check to see if DMA is enabled on your IDE disk drives (this will
improve load times between the harddisk and memory)
5. Install Service Pack 1 for WinXP

Other things to check:
1. If you have a Via Chipset on your motherboard, download and install
the latest 4in1 drivers. (The same would apply for Intel and SIS
chipsets....look for the latest chipset drivers)
2. Disable any programs running in the background (ICQ, Anti-Virus,
etc, etc) when playing EQ.
