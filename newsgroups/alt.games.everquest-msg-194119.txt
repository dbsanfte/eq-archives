Yeah I guessed it after I sent the post, no don't have PoP, yes I am
probably going to buy a couple of copies, I did try and get it before Sat
evening but no stores in my area stock it so will need to buy online...Must
do it today, maybe it'll arrive for weekend.

The other benefits of it are or were of little use to me, travel when you
have a 2nd Box running a 55th Druid isn't too much of a problem. I have now
started a character on FV, tho' and I really could use the PoK books to get
to the Bazaar.
