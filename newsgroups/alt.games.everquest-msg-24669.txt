Impossible to say without knowing the race of your enchanter.

I get the two robes from Crystal Caverns confused.  One is lavender, one is
dark blue & green.  On my gnome, the dark blue one (which also has CHA, btw)
looks spiffy. :)  I've yet to find any of my characters were that lavender
one looks less that flaming gay.  But, maybe it'll look better on a female,
though I sorta doubt it if the female is a gnome.  Maybe a DE female
enchanter?  I put an oracle robe on my DE necro and although it doesn't look
great, it sure beats the clash of the silk green drape.

Well, you get my drift.
