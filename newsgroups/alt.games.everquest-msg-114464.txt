  When possible, YES, absolutely.  I play the game to PLAY the game, not
waste time waiting on broken boats, not to hand in quest items only to lose
them to a broken NPC, not to spend hours trying to figure out wrong with my
computer, when in fact the problem is rooted in EQ's code.  The coding team
has to KNOW about a bug before they can fix it, so when someone at Verant
verifies that a bug exists (unless it is a dupe bug or something like that),
they should tell their players, or at LEAST tell their CS staff so they know
what to tell players when they /petition.  ASAP.

  It's not what makes ME special, it's what makes the situation special.
The Guide didn't even have a clue that the boats were broken until I told
him.  This is something that I thought I should attempt to remedy
immediately, both for my own sake and the other people who were waiting on
the boat, and the people after us.  And I think after waiting an hour plus
on a boat, and waiting 30 minutes on a petition, I'd waited long enough.  I
decided to let the Guide make the determination about whether or not my
/tell was worth responding to, and apparently he thought it was.  He even
thanked me for bringing the problem to his attention.  This Guide knew more
about CS than you do, apparently.

  But, you see, the problem here isn't just that *I* wasn't notified about
the problem, Verant's own CS staff was not notified about the problem
(either that, and they were, but someone ignored it.)

  Are you a Guide?  With an attitude like that, I really hope not.

  That is exactly what I would like for them to do, and I've said so in the
past.  When they KNOW about a bug that WILL effect a lot of people, they
should tell us about it promptly, and give us an ETA on a fix if possible.
Why?  Because in the long run, it will DECREASE their CS load and make their
customers HAPPIER, which is what good CS should be striving to do anyway.  I
would not have had to send a direct tell to a Guide if I had known and they
had known up front that the boats were broken.  I could've placed my
petition with confidence that after several minutes of waiting I'd get some
kind of response from a Guide.  This wasn't the case.  In fact, had I KNOWN
the boats were broken, instead of stressing the already overburdened CS
staff with a petition to summon me, I would have skipped the boat altogether
and used the Nexus spires.  Somebody at VI decided not to give me the option
to make that judgement.

  I understand that the game is very complicated.  However, you do not need
to fix a bug to realize that something is wrong with a specific game
mechanic.  If boats are broken, this is something that can be easily
verified.  I'm not saying the Guide has to give me a detailed technical
explanation on what exactly has gone wrong with the boats, I'm just saying
there should be a simple broadcast saying "Hey, the boats in TD are broken,
please /petition and be patient if you need to ride them.  We're sorry for
the inconvenience".  They have in fact done this before, but apparently
someone dropped the ball this time.
