The purpose of a prophet must be that of the God he serves, otherwise he's
not much of a prophet.

I can grant you the heterosexual part (since conservatives don't tend to
support gay marriges), and the US citizen part.  As for the white male, a
black woman would propser under conservative principles every bit as much as
a white man.  OTOH, the liberal policies of racial quotas and welfare has be
preventing minorities from reaching their true potential for too long.

So, where does that leave you?  What parts of the conservative agenda do you
disagree with?

I'll quote you directly, from a few posts prior:

"You buy into the hate speech from Limbaugh and his cronies."

Your words then don't match what you say now.  If I'm "buying into" Rush's
hate speach (which I really don't see very much of), then how can I be
thinking for myself?

I'm not trying to be a victim, but I will call you out when you display your
bias.

It's a Constitutional obligation of the government.  If we didn't pay the
military to defend our borders, income would surely be distributed to
whatever dictator decided to invade us.  Note, that this is not
re-distribution, but rather having everyone pay a share of the cost for
defending them.  It's payment for services rendered.  Welfare sort of fails
to reach that lofty goal.

Then you do not see what I believe to be the core idea that Jesus was
expressing.
