I've been to a lot of raids where we wait for the shaman to be ready before
pulling.  Or we don't engage until the magicians have mana, and start
pumping mod rods out.

It's not uncommon either..  Id say it happens every single day we raid

And "pathetic mana regen rate".. how many classes regen mana faster?
Enchanters KEI > BAoR (tho they stack, which helps clerics).. shamans, yes
but at the expense of their HP (which at times rules it out), necros (is it
faster regen?) again the same HP cost..  who else?
