Greetings,

For the past couple of levels I've been fighting in Greater Divide with my
necromancer, wolves and giants. I am now kindly with Thurgadin. Any idea how
would that make me with the dragons ? I did not have the chance to con a CoV
factioned mob yet. I've heard that you have to be ally with Turgadin just to
get out of KOS with dragons ... is that true ?

Another question: where can I safely go (well, more or less) and con a CoV
factioned mob ? No, I dont have the CS tooth yet and I am level 37 at the
moment. Thanks :)
