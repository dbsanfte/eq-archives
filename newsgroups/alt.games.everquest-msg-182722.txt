I am torn between 2 of them.

1. Extra bank space is very nice considering all the trade skill
items that have been added to the game and all the NO DROP
quest items.

2. Cartography system. Something that should have been in the game since

than 2 hours to get there, and without having to write 40 paragraphs of
directions over tells LOL.
