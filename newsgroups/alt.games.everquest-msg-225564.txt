I got in the habit of Charming (undead only) during the events that
regularily run on Stormhammer since they normally go through to a stage
where a train of 50 mobs or more go ape and trusty old Gimp is about as
effective as a 20 cent peice left on the track is in stopping a freight
train. Undead seem to be one of the most popular event mob classes and when
you throw Augumentation on them they turn into a jaw dropping damage
machine. I just make sure they are low enough on HP to be death marching
before going invis to break charm or alternately let him die in combat.
Other eventees would not be very happy to come up against an Aug'ed ex pet
methinks...

Now when I solo I constantly keep an eye out for dark blue undead mobs to
make into pets. I don't come accross them very often of course since I don't
choose zones ahead of time, but when I do find them I am a very happy
camper. Being solo gives you a lot more freedom here as you don't have to
worry about a buffed ex pet ripping your group a new pie hole.
