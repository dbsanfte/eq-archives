You should check out a spell list for your character.  I don't know
what the best list is but I tried typing in "Everquest spell list" to
google and got some good hits right on the top.  Generally the lists
give you a summary and you can click thru to detail on each spell.  

As I'm sure others have said, slowing and hastening are HUGE for
gameplay.  In fact, at the higher levels SoE had to disable some of
the effects of slowing (e.g. you get some sort of message that your
opponent is partially slowed) because otherwise slowing was just too
overpowering.  Generally you'll slow every mob that you fight, unless
the kills are going very fast.
