I have a horse - the cheapest kind, and its not much faster than my normal
run speed - a fair bit slower than Jboots. SoW does not work while on
horseback. You get the SoW icon im your spell list but no speed benefit
'till you dismiss your horse.

You med while sat on a horse and, I beleive while moving on a horse - but if
you are in combat, you dont med - that was fixed in a patch a few weeks
ago - so when kiting, you wouldnt be medding.

If you turn the graphic for horses off, you get your usual view of the game
and, you will be much more manouverable (turning round on horseback is
slower than when dismounted).

Hope this helps
