Do the quests from books that you get from the sage in South Qeynos.
If you can spare the money (the most expensive books are 12 sp) at
least. You'll get several dozen quests there alone, all of them
encouraging you to move around and kill different mobs. Some of them
you only need to visit places or catalog (see not kill) mobs.

Great quests there.
