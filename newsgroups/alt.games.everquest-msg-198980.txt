"Elegant" and "shit" in the same sentence. My aren't we giving the 
thesaurus a workout today.

Did I say I understand it "as well" as you? Hmm. I seem to remember 
saying at some point something to that effect more in making a point than 
the true sense of the phrase. If you'll recall, you pointed out something 
of which I may have been unaware, and I said something to the effect of 
"ok, *now* I know all about it. What else am I missing? Tell me, 
please." You evidently had nothing else to offer beyond your own opinion, 
to which you are completely entitled.

If that came across wrong, let me correct it here and now by saying I 
don't understand it *quite* as well as you because you *have* in fact 
experienced it first hand. That much goes without saying. I *do* 
understand it enough to have an opinion on the subject, and I require 
more than a simple, "It's hard, take it from me", or, "The guild split 
because of this" to convince me. Neither of those issues has been proven 
to me here beyond the "I've been there, and you haven't, so you must 
believe me" testimonials. You and a few others saying so is not 
representative of everyone

I have possible alternate explanations that *you* refuse to consider. 
Simple as that. Your reasoning being that I don't know what I'm talking 
about. I don't care. I'm obviously not going to change your mind. I'm 
perfectly fine with that. I don't measure my success by my ability to do 
so. I just can't believe you get so worked up because someone won't 
believe something you tell them. Maybe when *you* grow up you'll grow out 
of that.

Attacking me for a differing point of view...pompous windbag, thy name is 
usenet.
