It's similar.  Basically, when you iterate certain equations ad infinitum,
strange things happen.

You don't even have to use very complicated math to see weird concepts; I
remember fiddling with i (italics please) in calculus class.  For the
uninitiated, i is considered to be the square root of -1.  No such number
can actually exist.  The end result is that one can solve an equation and
discover that the solution cannot be.  It's math without an answer, and I
find that very interesting.
