I know ;) I said that - a 60 druid is a *fine* healer. a 58 druid
is still a good healer - I used to duo HOH as a 65 ranger and a 60
druid using melee rather than kiting tactics. it doesnt change 
the fact that at level 57 you're really hurting as a main healer. I
also went and did frogs in POV at 57 healing but it ate mana like
mad till a slower showed up and it wasnt remotely comparable to
the healing at 58, or 60.
