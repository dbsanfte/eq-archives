So it makes a necro or SK as good of a puller on raids as a monk. This
is worth tens of thousands of plat? Are monks that rare on any server?
And for soloing, particularly for necros, it kills your pet as soon as

Welcome to Xev. If they ever let people transfer servers with all their

everything will cost you that much more anyway.
