	Wurmslayers are great weapons -- for Rangers.

	A plate class PC should not use one, unless you know for certain you will
not be required to tank (which, IMO, you don't ever know).  Reason: weapon
taunt is based more on speed than damage.  A Wurmslayer hits like a ton of
bricks but it has no taunt value to speak of.  This is great if you're a
Ranger because you're not supposed to be getting hit.  It sucks if you're a
plate class who IS supposed to be taking the shots.

	When I got Swiftwind I handed down my Wurmslayer and used my Rat Whip
instead; it did slightly less damage but taunted a lot more.  I'd heard more
than one Ranger whining that their Earthcaller was getting them killed...
probably because they'd been swinging Wurmslayers for so long they forgot what
it's like to actually get near the top of a hate list.  (_My_ Earthcaller has
yet to get me killed.)
