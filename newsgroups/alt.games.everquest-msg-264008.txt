It kind of makes sense that it's more, otherwise there would be quite a bit 
of suicide group encounters for whatever reasons to further a cause.  So 
they set it up that all members share the experience loss which if added up 
is indeed more than a lone solo death. So the lesson is try not to die 
solo, and definitely try saving lives in the group at all costs, as a wipe-
out will be very painful.  Keeps those palms sweaty and hands shaking a bit 
when things get crazy.

Now if they'd just lose the darn con/aggro silver platter advertisements 
over mobs that would be peachy.
