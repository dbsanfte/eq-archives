True enough.  For years I used to be a beta test fiend.  Always keeping
track of what was coming  and applying for most that came up.  Usually
had two or three live betas going at a time.  Being in the early stages
of a release game can be a wonderful thing, especially if you'd been a

fresh releases get progressively more annoying to deal with.  I can
handle all the madness of an early beta, heck they were quarantined to a
secondary PC used just for betas so that I didn't have to worry what
happened to the PC, but at release I expect the madness to end.  These
days it seems that release is just the beginning of the madness.
