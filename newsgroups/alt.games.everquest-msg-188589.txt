I sort of learned to do that anyway, through observation.  I was observing
this guy with a pet against 4-5 orcs.  Both he and the pet were near death.
I was just about to jump in (and probably get myself killed as well) when
his hit points jumped up and orcs started falling like flies.  No one
external buffed him, so I don't really know what happened.  I was rather
impressed, actually.

I pretty much follow the policy that if a player is higher than light blue
to me, I don't help unless they ask for it.  If they die, well, they should
have hit the hot key that shouts help.  Since I'm only level 13, I figure
anyone lt.blue or green to me may be too busy to ask, so I'll jump in if
things look really grim.

Cheers,
Eric
