It is SO BOGUS when people make blanket statements about the performance of 
AMD processors.

The AMD Athlon Thunderbird outperforms a P3 for hundreds less, that's a 
fact.

Here's my config, and it's awesome:

AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1GHz
Asus A7V motherboard
Windows Me
384 Meg PC133 RAM
Quantum 40 Gig ATA/100 hard drive
Leadtek Winfast GeForce2 GTS (AGP) with 32 Meg

At the time, the motherboard and CPU cost me $400 locally and the price of 
a P3 1GHz was at least $400 more.

Please don't lump all AMD processors into your performance recommendations.  
You obviously haven't done a sufficient amount of research to be able to 
make such ignorant, uninformed statements.  If you ever owned one yourself 
with decent parts around it, you wouldn't say those kind of things.

Good day,
