Actually, technically, they are. The box doesn't say "playable online
via battle.net 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with zero down time". In
fact, it makes no implication that the service will be active the
majority of the time. As long as it's available part of the time,
they're meeting their obligations.

That said, the downtime isn't anywhere near 75 or even 50% of the
time. I'd say even 15% is an exagerration...
