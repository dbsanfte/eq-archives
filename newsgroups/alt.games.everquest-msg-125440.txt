Hey you guys might be able to help me out, as I am looking to replace alot
on my 45 warrior to better my current AC. At the moment my AC stands at 855.
If anyone is willing to sell some pieces of Cobalt armor for an Ogre, please
let me know as soon as possible. Also, I am on the Erollis Marr server. =\
I currently only have one piece of cobalt: gauntlets. Need more!
