Well, the V3 really isn't comparable to the current crop of
GeForce2(MX) based cards.

If you find that Luclin won't work to your satisfaction on the
machine, you can buy a GeForce2MX card at Best Buy for under
a hundred bucks, and *much* cheaper if you go online.

Personally, I'm hoping that a "budget" MX version of the GeForce3
will be out by the time Luclin ships and I'll get one of those
to replace my current GeForce 256 (yep, the very first GeForce!)
