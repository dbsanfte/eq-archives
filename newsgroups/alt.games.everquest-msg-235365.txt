Heh, didn't need the link.  On a magician the reference is obvious.
And I was being facetious about the Jay and Silent Bob reference.

There's the matter of "easily recognized" in there.  I only know of
3 people who have caught where my mage's name came from.

Is it?  Bosra just had a nice ring to it, like my BL on another account,
Crystof.  When I moved to Lanys to hang with my buddy who was new to EQ
I generated all 8 character slots in a brief time.  I was a bit surprised
that the mage is the one I stayed with.

Personally I wouldn't petition Chronic - it's just not offensive to me.

I'm reminded of a high school english teacher I had who's husband's name
was "Randall".  In America, almost everyone called him "Randy".  When she
did an exchange year in Scotland, however, she quickly discovered that 
calling your husband "Randy" was not for polite company.  Her counterpart,
a very pretty, very young Scots lady from the Orknees (sp?) was likewise
very embarrassed by the differences in the meaning of a word - Her first
day she came across one of her students putting lines through mistakes
instead of erasing them and ask him "What's the matter then, have you
forgot your rubber?"  15 year old sophmore turns bright read.  She repeats
herself in a voice loud enough for the whole class to hear "I said, did
you need a rubber?"  I think she asked several times, with the student
too utterly mortified to speak before someone had the heart to tell her
that a rubber was a condom im America.  In Scotland it's an eraser (as you 
might have guessed from context).  She was so utterly mortified that
she was almost unable to teach English Comp the next period when we came
in (and got the full story from the people leaving.) Who was it that said 
of England and America that (paraphrasing) "the biggest barrier between the 
two countries is a common language" ?
