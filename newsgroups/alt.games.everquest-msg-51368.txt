Who is this guy? He is in the sewer by the barb warrior trainer guy,
an sk trainer and several necro ones. My dark elf cleric is ally with
dismal rage, kindly with the dark elf cleric lady, amiable with opal
darkbriar (evil dark elf one) and indiff with this new guy Thiryn
Dernus. He was not there a while back and seems to have been put in
some recent patch.

He does not respond to hails and every so often takes off running
along the same path where he opens doors and runs around the perimeter
of that east freep slums area outside then goes back in a different
building through the secret wall and back to his starting point. He
responds to no hails along that route either. I gave him a coin and a
piece of junk just to see what he says and he makes no negative
reaction like "uhhh thanks.. I guess...." or such to them either.

Anyone know what he is for.. or some new quest maybe he is a receiver
for?

In addition to him now being there I sometimes see a message now:

"a trip wire begins casting a spell" 

as spam along with the various other people casting.  One necro guy
who trains in the sewer said he saw that and the tripwire snared him
and hit him for 250 several times and he died. 

What is up with verant and hating us poor evils.. first they dump
brianna poxbringer down there who is on the bertoxx (qeynos area) sk
guild faction .. which of course some people using the freep one did
not have. They moved her to west freep in some sewer alcove by
herself, but now they have this trip wire somewhere..
