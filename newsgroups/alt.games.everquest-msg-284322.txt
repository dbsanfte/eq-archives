Be careful.  Initial hate is capped.  The first time you personally do 
something to a mob which puts you on the hate list, the amount of hate 
you get is capped at a reasonably low value.  Which means while your 
current instant-hate spell might be below that value, your later ones 
may not be and you might gimp your aggro.

This is why warriors *still* tag with a bow and *then* use incite / 
bellow / whatever to add raw hate.

The mechanics of hate can be a bit weird and I strongly recommend 
reading the relevant posts on the Steel Warrior forum.

As you've found, tanking is never stress free, and being a good tank is 
40% awareness.

Edit: Bah, never mind, I've just checked all the Terror spells and 
you're ok.  They do 1 hate, and the rest of the hate is added via 
another field, which means they avoid the hate cap.  Only one of the 
warrior discs is configured like that with the others actually being 
capped, so you're ok with Terror as your initial hate grabber if you 
have the mana.
