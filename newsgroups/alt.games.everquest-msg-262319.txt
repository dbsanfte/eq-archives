Hmmm. I can already do that while twisting, and I don't think most bards 
would find it *that* challenging even; its not nearly as good as it 
could be with 2 players, but its pretty trivial to root, and throw a few 
dots on a mob and then start twisting. (Pull with bard slow, so the shm 
has lots of time to get the root and dots going)

The amount of effort required 2nd box a shaman for an effective (not 
optimal, but adequate) root-bot is minimal. Sure you can do it 'easier' 
and more effectively now because your focus can be on the shaman the 
whole time and not the bard, but really, whats the difference between 
this and substituting a ranger for a bard, and using a gamepad to 
autofire while you root rot...?

Nothing. 

It just means that something you could already do with other classes you 
can now do with bards (for less dps).

vs having 2 or 3 bards autofollowing the cleric each singing one song. 
Your right this makes it easier, and now more guilds can do it; it 
wasn't commonly done but its already been an option.

I don't see how. Now you can actually play your class instead of being 
relegated to following the cleric playing manasong and resists because 
you are the only bard on the raid.
