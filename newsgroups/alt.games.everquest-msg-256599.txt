Hm, interesting.  Maybe I'll risk one of my proccing range items
in a similar experiment.  I was cleaning out Runnyeye for a while
to raise faction with the Rivervale druids (including that Ella
Foodcrafter chick who runs around Misty Thicket and has nuked my
sorry ass far too often :-), and along the way accumulated four
"a vile substance" from the janitor there.

They didn't look especially useful as one-shot items, but if I can
get the proc from putting them in Range while using something more
expendible from Ammo (e.g., my mage friend's summoned daggers), they
become a bit more interesting.
