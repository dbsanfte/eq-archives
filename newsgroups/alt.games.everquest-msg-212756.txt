Depends.

You can turn in gnoll teeth just like you do in Qeynos.

There is a quest or two upstairs in the bank. I think mammoth hides is one.
I seem to recall 'Fang of the Wolf' barbarian rogue poker may be there too.
They didn't like my halfling druid or human ranger, but by starting the
trade and sneaking behind them it worked.

There is the LS pouch you find by the rogue guildmaster in FP. Just turn it
in to Lenka<sp?> upstairs for several Halas factions.

Something I've found is feeding Frostbite regurgatonic raises some Halas
factions. You need some good faction in SFG, and with the gnome zookeeper to
get that far. Once you have the regurgatonic I don't think Frostbite cares
what your faction is as long as he doesn't attack.
