	SWG has local banks, and they are about as enjoyable as a high colonic.

	The EQ team has been very good at watching what the SWG team is doing, and
adapting the Good Bits for their own use.  A lot of the newer stuff in EQ was
very obviously lifted from pre-release SWG.  I think it's also safe to say
they're paying close attention to what isn't working for SWG, too.
Unfortunately, the SWG team refuses to learn from EQ's mistakes.
