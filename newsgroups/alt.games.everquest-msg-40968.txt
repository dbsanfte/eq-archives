DAoC's level basedeness puts EQ to shame. Levels mean 10x in Camelot what
they mean in EQ.

Fight something at level 15...it kicks your ass.
Fight the same thing at 16, you win with 90% hp/mana left.

Fight a player 1 level higher than you? 99 out of 100 times, you will lose,
unless the person you are fighting is AFK most of the time.
Fight a player 4+ levels higher than you? He kills you in 2 hits max.
