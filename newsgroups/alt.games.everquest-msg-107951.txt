Untrue.  As a Bristlebane worshipping bard I was completely safe anywhere 
in Ogguk, Grobb, Innothule, or Feerott, other than shaman/sk guild halls, 
as long as I had my illusion mask on.  I was bound in Ogguk for close to 
15 levels, and saw many wolf-form druids happily shopping and banking 
there.
