Ya know, I've followed this thread and seen you say this over and over.
But I'm still waiting for you (or anyone) to answer the real meat of the
OP's question. Ok, so if the *color* of the message only indicates the
xp, why even bother having any text besides the faction part of the
message. The phrases "you should be able to beat this opponent" and
"what would you like your tombstone to say" don't really suggest
anything about xp to me. They suggest that I (or I and my group) will be
victorious should we attack this creature, or that I/we will need the
services of somebody with a shovel shortly.

If VI is so aware of this and constantly commenting on it, etc. might
one not think they would get around to changing the text to say things
more to the effect of "this creature is too lowly for you to learn
anything from" and "should you somehow manage to defeat this incredibly
powerful creature, you will benefit immensely." or words to that effect?
