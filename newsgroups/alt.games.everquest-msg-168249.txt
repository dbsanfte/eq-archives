I've noticed, when paying for KEI, that I <don't> have to wait when
I pay in advance (I also have always paid more than 50pp).  Same for
ports, I put the payment up immediately, before the porter has time
to invite usually.  And I pay 30-50pp for a port because if I want a
port I want it now (I can always do some running and use PoK) and in
EQ, as in RL, bigger tips usually get better and faster service.
