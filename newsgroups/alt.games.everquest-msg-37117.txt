My admittedly limited understanding, based on chatting with people who either are,
or know, guides is as follows:  They primarily serve as "filters" to cut down on
the number of things of *real* importance that get passed on up to the GMs.  Lot's
of /petitions are likely for stuff that's not allowed, just plain stupid, or might
be requests for information, etc.  The guides can tell the ones in the first two
classes, "Sorry, but we can't help you with that." etc.  If they know the answers
to informational requests, and are allowed to give it out, then they could provide
that and send the petitioner on their merry way.  I believe they also have some
*limited* "superpowers", like summoning somebody's corpse who died zoning in a
boat, or get's stuck under the world, etc.
  However for bigger issues that will require reimbursement of xp, loot, etc. if
it looks like a valid request, they can then pass it up the line to the server GM
to decide and act on. This way, out of the thousand /petitions that hit the system
every day, hopefully the GM will only have to look at a couple hundred and you
have a *chance* that they'll get to yours. :-)
