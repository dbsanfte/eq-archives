Me and my wife have been hunting in Sirens Grotto of late (both
2boxing 65's SK/Chanter/Shammy/Cleric) and have noticed something odd
last night.

We started by working through the zone, killing as we went (we were
collected parts for her Shammy's 7th shawl quest) and it was going
very well. We were in the middle of one of the tunnels when the server
crashed. We had JUST looted the final piece we needed quest, so we
figured that due to the crash we were going to have to get it again
(which it turns out we didnt - a little piece of good news in
anotherwise annoying night).

When the server came back up, we knew the zone would be repopped and
if we were still at the spot when the server crashed - we would have a
mess on our hands. So the plan was to log in the SK first - FD and see
if there was a good time to zone in the rest. Well, my SK was
immediately swamped - but I got the FD off - we were indeed still at
the same point - or very close to it. To make a long story short, we
waited untill the most opportune time - but it still was a mess and we
all bit the dust.

So we petitioned that we had died due to the server crash. My 2 chars
were rezzed first, and fortunately, the GM moved my corpses to the
succor point and rezzed me. While waiting at the zone to WW (western
wastes - I say this because apparently its not that obvious - read on)
a few groups would appear and zone out (im assuming they succ'd over).
Each time a group did, as I waited for the GMs to rez my wife's chars,
I would start to inexplicably get nailed by a AOE and suddenly the
Mistress of the Deep (or whatever the major boss of the zone is named)
would appear and start to whoop on me. I was able to zone each time,
but thought it was odd that a succord group would cause this.

At no other point would this happen, but if a group appeared, sure
enough.... wham.

Another GM showed up and rezzed my wife's chars. This turned out to be
another saga. It was a different GM, and he initially rezed her at
where we all died - and of course died again. She told him that the
other GM rezzed me at the succor point at the WW zone (she SHOULD have
spelled out WW for him!). She ends up rezzed in warsliks woods DOH!
But thats besides the point.

We are medding up (at the succor point) and again, another group
appears and you can guess what happened.

There was one particular group that Im assuming was fighting down the
well and would get in trouble and succor (I didnt ask - I was in too
foul a mood - and thought it best to not say anything - for it would
only make the situation worse). Each time they did, wed get trained by
the boss and her guards. One time we were fighting near the well and
suddenly she would appear and start messin with us.

I cant figure out why this is happening when a group succors -
effectively zoning and clearing the aggro of the mobs. If it were only
happening when we were fighting near the well, Id chalk it up to us
somehow aggro-ing them, but this would happen when we were just
sitting at the zone line minding our own business. Just odd!
