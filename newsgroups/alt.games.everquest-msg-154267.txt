Agree the "change" starts around about nToV levels.  But the HP difference
between an nToV geared warrior and monk is still around 2k - thats a huge
difference.  Add highest end velious gear (tunare, AoW loot, and Luclin loot
etc) and the gap is around 1.6k between a high end monk and warrior - a part
of the game not even 1% of the population will ever see

Considering our avoidance comes out at around SIX percent over other melees.
SIX fucking percent

Its not even that great for other classes.. 40ac on a monk bp? OMFG UBER!
Just a warriors HoT bp is around 59 ac though, vindi and statue BP's are
around 60ac (plus 100hp, AoB etc).

As an example, itiki drops 2 BP's - wyvern hide 40ac 50hp (uber for monks),
he also drops a (correct my guesses) 45ac 40hp bp for rogues (and sk's? I
forget now)... funny that the second one always rots but the first one is
godly

A guild rogue got his skyshrine BP, it was like 45ac and 95 HP..  see the
difference?

No taunt, no EB weapons meaning they will NEVER be a MA of choice.  No
defensive meaning once again, NEVER the MA of choice

For all the whining of monks tank better than warriors, I am still yet to
see a guild who's MA is a monk.  Even FoH, where Furor is the biggest whiner
of monks "leetness" doesnt have monk tanks for emp, seru, aow etc - why not?
I mean if monks make better tanks......

Btw triton used a druid as MA for rhag2,  FoH used a naked bard to MA nToV -
this is a part of the game that < 1% of people will EVER approach, why
destroy a class for everybody when just that tiny percentage has a problem?
Or more to the point, when Furor and his dick waving feels jealous of monks
and whines.

A NAKED bard tanked nToV.. im sorry but thats wrong!  Bards need HP,
mitigation and defensive caps reducing by 50%.  And a druid MA on rhag2..
sorry but thats not in the vision.  Druids throughout EQ must immediatly
have their HP and defence reduced by 50% to make up for this hugely glaring
game-inbalance
