And for those who are cut-and-paste challenged... here is the caster section
of that excellent FAQ:

Casters general tactics:

At the lower levels casters can join the melee, in fact they should join to
keep their defense skills maxed out. However, at the higher levels you'll
just end up getting yourself killed or the healer will waste mana on trying
to keep you alive. Generally it is more efficient to cast a few spells and
then sit your ass back down and meditate to recover more mana while the
tanks finish off the MOB. I know it may seem like you are not contributing
but an OOM caster is of no use to anyone. Your melee skills pale in
comparison to the effect of your spells. Your spells are your armor and
your weapons!

Casters KEEP REPORTING your mana levels! The puller needs to know how
everyone is doing on mana so they know what and how much to pull. The
puller should not have to ask for a mana report. A good rule of thumb is to
make it a habit to report your mana at each bubble. You may even want to
make hot keys. At the very least warn when you are low or OOM.

When the puller comes back with a pull casters DON'T start casting on the
MOB right away. Let the tank beat on it a little bit to get the MOB good
and mad at the tank. Then cast on it. Exception to this is an enemy spell
caster in which case you cast earlier. Another exception may be an enchanter
that wishes to get their pet to attack.

If you are a nuker get a good feeling for how much damage your tanks are
doing and try to keep pace with what they are doing and don't exceed it.
If the tank has put 200 points of damage into a MOB and you nuke the MOB
for 500 guess who the MOB is going to attack now? That's right YOU!
Sometimes casting several smaller nukes instead of one big one is a better
idea.

Nukers and de-buffers: Use /assist [MainTankName] to target the MOB your
Main Tank is currently attacking.

Nukers remember to stay back from MOBs. Remember Proximity is a taunt!

If you are a caster and/or you want a MOB off of you MUST do 4 things:

1)Don't run around like a chicken with your head cut off! If you run the
  MOB moves out of melee range of the tank and he has to turn and run
  around after it. Also you may run out of the range of the healer trying
  to heal you. Let the tank stay in range of the MOB.

  If you are outdoors and you have a little more room to move then move in a
  circle. Keeping the other group members in the center and drag the MOB
  around them so that the casters are all still in spell range of the MOB
  and you.

2)STOP attacking it! And STOP casting spells on it! This is important!
  Don't panic! The tank can't get the MOB off of you if you keep pissing it
  off. The tank has to move himself up the hate list and he can't do that
  if you keep angering the MOB.

3)Face the MOB and don't turn your back on it.

4)Give the Tank or Rogue a chance to take a few swings on the MOB then back
  away a short distance. If the mob follows you stop and try again.

If the Puller is a class that can Feign Death(like Monks and Shadow Knights)
do not cast heal or buffs on them when they are pulling and doing a Feign
Death pull. If you do the spell at the wrong time you will be added to ALL
of the mobs hate lists. This can quickly bring a train down on the group.
