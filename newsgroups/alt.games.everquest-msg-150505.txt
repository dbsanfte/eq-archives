I agree that they should make permarooted mobs summon if you start casting
spells on them, or, even if you just get close enough to agro.  Since they
can't move, they should be able to move you to them.  The other solution,
would be to make it so that the debuff spells just won't land on them at
all, or only if you are in melee range.  If you can only cast from within
melee range, then you had better get a tank in there to get aggro first, or
you will have a few pasted casters on a mob like that.

The thing is, if they permaroot a mob, and they do not adjust it's resists
such that debuffing is not possible, or put the mob in a location where you
have to be in melee range in order to have LOS, then, it would be stupid not
to debuff the mob first.

There are a number of things they can do to fix these issues that have
precedent within the game.  Telling someone that you cannot use a spell, as
it is designed to be used, because the mob you are attacking is permarooted
seems pretty silly to me.
