But, at least she can do some pottery with that wet clay while she is there!
I don't know any recipes with "wet clay", though.  Just got my pottery to
125 last night.

I think Dyllin can be from level 12-15, so if he spawns low, he might be
soloable by a druid ( never played one, just guessing ).  There are other
bandits there, along with a really high level bandit, I think, and -that's-
what I would be worried about at low level.

Go here to read about him and strategies on ganking him:
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=1684  ( says he is level
12-16 ).  You can get to the quest from that page.
