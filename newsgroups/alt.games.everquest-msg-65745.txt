Let me guess, you are a halfling?

When you cast an illusion spell, the game gives you the correct
size regardless of your character race size, as far as everyone in
the zone is concerned.  However, people who log in or zone
in after you cast the spell often see you looking like the correct
illusion race, but at your "real" size.

This is most frequently observed in Gnomes enchanters using
the Troll illusion... but I'd assume that halfling druids would
suffer the same little glitch.  Wood elves too maybe?

Course it could be something else entirely...
