FYI, you can still train up Instill Doubt if the mob you target is not
within melee range, and the target won't even notice. I will often target
a bazaar guard and ID while browsing wares, or target Brother Estle and
ID while running across WK. It's safer if you don't target wandering mobs.
I've had one guard wander back in range while I was practicing it him.
Ooops!

You can also train it up on corpses, too.
