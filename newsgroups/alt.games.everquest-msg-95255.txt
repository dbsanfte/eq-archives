You only really need the lil halfling guy, usually if I don't find the
Sir Hobble guy up, i find the lil halfling fuzzin behind that cleric
paladin building the bridge leads to. He is usually way on the outside
of it, in the back standing on the grass doing nothing. Even then he
is often moving around rapidly and its only possible to get one scale
on him and hit trade before he is out of range again. This is fine
though if you can't get him to stop. Just make sure all three times
its HIM you are giving the scale to (always check the name before
hitting trade anyway)
