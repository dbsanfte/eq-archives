Do cleric in these situations cast CH as fast
as they can?  Or do they count off a delay
before doing it?  Ixi and rage are the biggest
mobs I've been in on, and we did those with
a 3 cleric chain.

The thing is, they still benefit the spells I most
want a boost in speed on - my 6 second Shock and
my 7 second bolt, 5 second gate.  I use the long 
cast time spells (summon pet, shielding) so infrequently
during a play session, and never in an emergency,
that it doesn't affect play for me that they're not
accelerated.  Not affectign scars is a small blow.

This isn't the first time I've seen vitriol
laden rants from their members, so I didn't
even bother to go to the main thread.  Furor
and his lieutenant Kruegen (sp?) were very
vocal in their dislike for DAoC.
