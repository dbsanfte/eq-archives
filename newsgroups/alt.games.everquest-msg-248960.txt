Riwwi arena, though I'm not sure how easy it is to solo for a wizard.
Mobs spawn, walk into the arena, kill some yunjo slaves, then walk out and
despawn. Every once in a while a named spawn who can drop excellent droppable
gear. The nice thing is that since they despawn you can camp it while reading
a book or whatever and just wait until a named spawns.

It's easy for bards and necros, not sure how well a wizard will fare. Some of
the nameds spawn those short duration Ukun pets, not sure if you can outrun
them without a selo speed horse.

Ask Ketaboo how it's done :)
