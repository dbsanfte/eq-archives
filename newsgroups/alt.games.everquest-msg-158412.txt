i thought about this.  and i kinda like the idea, but i think that a
dialog box should pop up for binds (similar to xlocs).  in fact, does
anybody know why a box _doesn't_ pop up?  getting bound in a bad spot
seems to be about as bad a thing as can happen to a character,
especially one that can't re-bind themselves in a more sane spot (this
coming from a half-elf ranger who saw a non-KoS soulbinder in the OT
outpost and decided to grab a bind there, subsequently losing a full lvl
and a half in a death loop, and an enchanter with fewer hp than ran
flamespinner AE's goblins for and lost a full yellow bubble of xp when
it took him two AEs to clear the train that was brought up there;
nothing like loading again before you even knew you were alive again
;) ).

i was also thinking it should be an AA thing, but i have no idea why :P
