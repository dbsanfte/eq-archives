While in Chardok with no mage this week, we killed people with my animation
pet (chanter, non-kos) and I drug them down to be rezzed.  The theory we
were operating on was that pet kills give us the 3 hour rez timer as opposed
to the much shorter duel rez timer.

I forgot to check to see if that was true, but I know some of the rezzes
took more than 5 minutes (some as long as half an hour or more due to a few
issues) and noone complained about xp loss...
