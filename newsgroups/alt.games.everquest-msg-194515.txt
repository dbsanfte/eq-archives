Lich is 20 mana per tick and KEI is 14 so that's 30% better.

Since you life tap while you hunt the hit point loss is trivial to
offset.

Lich is your spell so you can use it whenever you want and don't
have to make trips to nexus or pok and pay a chanter bot 100pp for it.

Sorry I'll take Lich over KEI all day long.
