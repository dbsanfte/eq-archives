Hey all, this happened to me today and I was wondering if anyone else has
had this experience:
Beware there is a spolier here.

I was at the West Gate in FP, a lower level pally comes up to me and asks if
I am interested in trading anything. Me being a pally myself, I am always
trying to help those in need and this guy actually had something to trade,
not your typical beggar "Do you have anything you can give me?" type.

Well we start the trade and we have to cancel it and then my stuff is gone.
I missed the message that it had dropped due to my inventory being full. I
had to scroll up the chat window to actually see it. Well the pally and I
spend a few minutes checking the ground for my stuff. No dice. So I start
asking around very politely if anyone happened to have picked up the items.
I do need them back as they are my only set of that type. Nada, nothing. A
couple of other kind souls try looking around as well. Still nothing. At
this point, I get the usual "Bummer d00d" and "Sucks to be you" type of
things. I do a quick check to see if there are any GM's avail to tell me
what my options are. Zippo also. Then I ask how to find any Guides online
and I get some feedback on how to do that. Again zippo. Finally, I am about
to write the items off and try and go buy/hunt for replacements, when
someone says "I know where your stuff is!" I say GREAT and he leads me to a
hidden tunnel just outside of town. There is a NPC in there that is RTM and
is dubious to me. But lo and behold, there is my stuff!!! No I'm not going
to say how to get there, the fact that there is one should be enuff for some
people. But anyway....
I get my stuff and thank the person profusely. I give him what plat I have,
he was a very low level char, and give him a couple of other items that
might help him as well. I gave him everything I could afford to.
So my question is this. Has anyone else had this happen to them? Drop stuff
and find it somewhere else? Did the NPC really cart it off? Did some other
PC take it and decide that they couldn't use it?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
