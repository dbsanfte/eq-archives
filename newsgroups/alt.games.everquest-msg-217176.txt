i hate death when i am on duty also, but i have also realized that 
sometimes the deaths are ok, in context...even my own

i have been in situations where i came within 5% of dying, and had tanks 
abjectly apologizing to me because i caught agro while healing and they 
couldnt taunt it off me, so i got doubled a couple of times...and they 
said i should have let them die rather than pop that remedy that kept 
them alive <boggle>

alt/rant....if a mob has wicked good HP [in the 55-60 LDoN adventures] 
and agro is supposed to be based on among other things how much damage 
somebody does to the mob....if that tank has done 6k damage, how come 1 
tiny remedy can pull agro and not let them get it back<boggle>
