I'm thinking that she was probably either moved or removed from the game.

But consider this.  Rubies cost 130pp, best price.  I've heard people say
that they've given her 40 or 50 rubies with no earring.  I've also heard
from people that got it on the fourth or fifth one.  Twenty or so seems to
be the average.

So figure on spending 2600pp on it.

Back in the old days, pre-Kunark, the hoop was a truly uber item, and well
worth the money you'd have to spend to get it.  This is why all the guides
for this quest drool over it.  But now?

Go to the bazaar and see what kind of earring you can get for 2600pp.
