You might like the giant fort in Warsliks Woods.  You could also camp the
Bracer of scavenging in the same zone (AC9 and a couple of stats)
Though that zone is pretty empty, once you can swarm kite giants, you'll
be taking down giants left and right

Another good place is echo caverns.. for a little while anyway.  There are some
relatively easy static spawns there

Have fun
