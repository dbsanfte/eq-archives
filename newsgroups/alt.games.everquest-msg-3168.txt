We were in Chardok and had just pulled the Herbalist room.  Mob gated
back, we all /q out, nobody can get back in for 30 minutes, come back
in one at a time to fully spawned room.  Took about 90 minutes to get
everyone back, rezzed, and out.  Oh well, at least we're set up well
for another try tomorrow.
