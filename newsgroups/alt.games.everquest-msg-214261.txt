You want Dark Age of Camelot then.

very death friendly. Actually I've heard an argument death is worse than eq
(because of low effect of rezzes on death xp), but I find that hard to
swallow:
die.
Lose X xp. (can't drop a level though, no deficits. Leads to zerging once
someone dings 50)
alternative 1: Get rezzed. Gives back 1/2 X xp.
alternative 2:/release from corpse (forced after a limited time based on
level), end up at bind point with all gear.
Optional after alternative 2: Go back to gravestone, /pray, get back 1/2 X
xp.

Or Star Wars Galaxies, where you can insure your critical gear, and only
have to go back for carried money and other stuff. Actually, it looks like
they don't even do that anymore (I'm not insured, never left a corpse behind
since they had a corpse looting bug and made everyone 'newbies' for about a
month... no penalty whatsoever for death). They may be planning to replace
it with something else. Downside is limited bind points (cities only, in
cloning centers). If you are not 'bound' on the planet you die on, you get a
lot of wounds (damage you have to see a doctor to fix, doesn't regenerate)
and battle fatigue (makes you harder to heal, have to go sit in a cantina
for a while).
