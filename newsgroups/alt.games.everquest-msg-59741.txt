    DAoC is somewhat unique in that what YOU do isn't as important as what
your REALM does. Again, consider the Merlin server. One realm had a
disproportionate number of powergamers, who got themselves and their realm
as high as possible, as fast as possible. They then went and conquered both
the other realms before those realms had the levels to defend themselves.
Even if you had been as motivated as possible to defend against the
powergamers, you HAD to have the same level of dedication from the other
players in your realm to make it possible.

    I imagine the original poster was talking more about what happened to
the first high levels on Merlin who weren't in Conquest's realm: come over
the hill, see a horde of enemies. Run, or die. Repeat until you re-roll on
Conquest's side.
