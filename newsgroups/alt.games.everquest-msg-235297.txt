>>> WTF was the the 'beta' for?<<<

Judging by the amount of complaints in beta PoK, quite a few people thought
it was to /betabuff characters to 65 then go into the planes. I cannot tell
you the amount of times people said "this sux" when others told them they
had to go into the new zones to fight.

Personally, I am interested to see how the 10- 64 levels bersekers are gonna
fair out. At any given time there were only a handful of folks playing
newbie berserkers and I never saw one over 12 or so.

I screwed around with the Tribute thing a bit, but never got the numbers
others are seeing. _________________________________
