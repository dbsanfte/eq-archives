I have a level 18 Necro and I went to Befallen on my own.  Everything
on the first level was green to me and I still got pasted because
there were so many of them and they just kept re-spawning before I had
cleared enough of them to progress to the next level.  What are the
lower levels like?  Is it even worth going in a group to wade past the
greens to get lower down?
