Its worse than that . Many times monks and rogues will pull off a warrior as
well just from sheer dammage. Taunt only puts a warrior one point above the
person with the highest aggro (when it suceeds in the first place which is
about half the time).Warriors do not effectively group well with anyone at
65.

warior one engages does 400 dammage has aggro (400)
mobs smacks warior
monk engages does 500 dammage has agro (500)
rogue engages does 1800 dammage has aggro (1800)
mob smacks rogue
all aggro reduced on tick by half
warrior smacks mob for 400 (aggro 600)
warrior taunts mob for up to aggro (901) 'rogue previous aggro plus one '
monk smacks mob for 700 dammage (aggro 950)
rogue smacks mob for 1100 dammage then evades (aggro 0)
mob smacks monk
