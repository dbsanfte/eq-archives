Necro and Shaman is a nice combo.  The shaman's ability to cast regen
means the necro can lich much faster.  The pet could kill without
needing fear once the shaman slows the mob and hastens the pet.
You'll have quite a few Dots -- the necro fear would likely be used
only to get the mob away since pets are not that good at taunting to
keep heavily DoT'd mobs occupied.

Considered a Shaman and Magician?  The magician pet is very strong and
even better with shaman buffs, haste, heals and slowing of mobs.  The
magician can summon focus items to increase the power and speed of DD
spells and the duration of buffs.  With Sow and Root (not to mention
Gate), your characters can get away while the 2 pets keep the mobs
occupied if things start to go wrong.
