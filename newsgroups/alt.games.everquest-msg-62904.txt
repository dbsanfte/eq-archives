  I was able to solo up to 42 with only mariginal wisdom (started with a
base of 100).  I didn't get any really nice wisdom buffing stuff until
around 30.  At 42 I was able to solo just fine with ~160 wisdom.

  The difference at level 30 between a druid with 121 wisdom and a druid
with 160 is about 185 mana.  That's not even two nukes.  Sure, it can be the
difference between being able to finish off the mob with a full tank of
mana, and having to finish it off with meditating... but at level 30, even a
low wisdom druid should be able to solo pretty effectively.  As you advance
into the mid-40's, your tactics probably move more towards root-DoTing which
lowers the importance of the size of your mana tank, since you are
meditating for most of the fight.  I've never run entirely out of mana
root-DoTing, but having a larger mana tank does give you the option of
ending the fight a bit earlier with a few end nukes.

  So the only place where I see wisdom as being truly crucial is if you plan
on quad kiting.  That's still a healthy several levels away, and before a
druid has to worry about that, they're going to have the option of soloing
giants for heavy cash, so they SHOULD have enough money to buy wisdom gear
by the time it becomes important.

  I'm not saying wisdom isn't important... it is hands down the most
important stat for a soloing druid... but even naked, a druid can do okay
solo.  Having more wisdom may mean ending your fights a bit earlier and
easier (with perhaps a little bit more downtime after the fight), but as
someone who stressed and fretted over my wisdom at my lower levels, I can
pretty safely say it's nothing to get yourself too tied up over.

  At 29 the gnolls should pretty easily soloable. :)  It would probably be
more time-efficient to just find a group that has a spare pair of gloves and
buy them for 5pp or so, though.

  Even nicer is if you can get together a group to hunt that ogre shaman in
East Karana, or the indentical one in the Timorous Deep who drops chipped
bone bracers.  Decent experience at 29, too.  In a few more levels, a few
camps become viable for a druid... goblin alchemist at 29 in Permafrost is
probably already doable for the mammoth hide cloak... at 35 or so the
ancient croc is a pretty safe bet for his gatorscale leggings... Thistle
Underbrush can be killed for his braided ivory cords... the other Permafrost
mob that drops wolf skin slippers (I forget it's name... I believe the
slippers are +20 mana... pre-Velious there were no good +mana/+wisdom boots
for druids that were affordable and easily obtainable... not sure whether or
not that's changed).  Jewelery wise, gold jasper earrings and silver jasper
rings should be pretty affordable.  Platinum jasper rings if you've got a
bit more money to drop, and a silver ruby veil.

  Also, do not totally ignore +mana items.  +Mana is just as good as +wisdom
in many cases.  At higher levels, +wis does give you a larger boost in mana,
but at lower levels, oftentimes straight mana buffing items increase your
mana pool moreso than wisdom buffing items.  At level 30, 1 point of wisdom
equals 6 points of mana.  So that's something to keep in mind.
