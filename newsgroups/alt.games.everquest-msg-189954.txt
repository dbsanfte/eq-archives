They're actually a franchise where the names I've seen are "Joey's Seafood",
"Boyd's Seafood", et cetera.  They use the same sign structure and colours,
so I assume they're all related.

Never tried fake chicken.  I just use semi-fake (processed chicken patties
for burgers).

Any caesar salad dressing worthy of the name will have anchovy paste.
Reason is, the standard recipe for the dressing calls for it.

Hmm.  Hard choice.  Depends on what the girlfriend looks like.

If there's a Harvey's anywhere around where you live (I don't know if
they're only a Canadian restaurant or if they can be found in the Excited
States), go try their veggieburgers.  They're excellent.  Quite a bit better
than the BK veggieburgers, and far, far better than the McVeggie.
