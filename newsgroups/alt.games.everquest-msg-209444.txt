Faned, I'm starting to think you're going out of your way to avoid the
point.  Monks, rogues, and SKs don't have AOEs; at best you need one of the
above as a puller.  The concept you're so carefully dodging is that anyone
with a usable AOE spell can function in an AOE group. The ingredients are -
an enchanter for PBAOE stuns, someone to heal, and four AOE DPS classes,
possibly losing 1 AOEr for a puller (I think a wizard pulls just fine, but
others differ).  If the healer and one of the DPS folks switch roles on
occasion, so long as they can fulfill their role, it's all good.

Oh, and here's a GOOD reason to have a cleric or druid in a PBAOE group
doing AOE.  Wizards have one AOE with significant push, and it sucks in
terms of damage.  Priests have several AOEs with serious knockback, and a
couple of them do good damage as well.  I recently did an AOE group
(executioner trial, actually) with a warrior, cleric, druid, two wizards,
and an enchanter.  Chanter, cleric, and the two wizards huddled in the
corner; as each group spawned, warrior did a quick run-out and brought them
all in, and as the AOE burn started the druid ran out, faced the corner,
fired a knockback AOE - and dragged all mobs on the edge neatly into the
stunweb/firefield.  We had the druid do it since the druid was 60 and the
cleric was 57.  We flagged the cleric, the druid, the enchanter and one of
the wizards on the second try - only the warrior and I were already flagged.
Not bad, considering it was the first time those four had even tried the
trials.

So yes - having one person with knockback AOEs moving around to position
mobs is a good thing, so long as everyone knows what their doing.
