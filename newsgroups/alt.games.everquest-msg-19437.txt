So you're the one who's been killing all the fish!  and I need those piranha
teeth to fix my Deeppockets faction ( I killed Gunrich one or two.... dozen
times )

perhaps send me a tell sometime and we can come to an, ah, mutually
beneficial agreement?

BTW, if anyone comes out to High Keep, bring me some booze, will pay well
for it, preferably something strong, and not Ol'Tujum's, that stuff is too
watery for me ( My personal favorite is Innoruuk's kiss of death sold at the
FP dock, lore so I can only have 1 stack at a time on me, will pay 10pp for
somebody to bring me a stack)
