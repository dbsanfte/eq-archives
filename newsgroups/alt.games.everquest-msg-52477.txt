Yes, there is a detailed option you can turn on in Agent/FAgent. I don't
fancy myself anything. Thats a can of worms that gets opened
periodically.  He asked a question that was potentially region specific
so that info was important.  I'm really not a bad guy.  Just trying to
be helpful, and hanging out,  Talking about EQ and anything else that
comes up.

There doesn't seem to be a method to the local server names.  I could be
mistaken, haven't had a need to dig deeper.

I haven't gotten pissed off about anything in this NG for quite some
time.  Quite frankly, I don't have the spare energy to be pissed.  I
don't advertise IP adresses anyway, @home does.  and that in itself is
worth the $7.95 investment for giga or super, etc.
