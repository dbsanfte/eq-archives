Actually the problem people were having is *with* the latest firmware. The 
solution that has worked in the postings I've seen is to actually 
downgrade the firmware to a previous version. I too have had no problems 
with mine, but I don't know what version of firmware is on mine. I've 
never upgraded it, so for all I know I'm already using the version people 
must downgrade to.

How do I check what version it is?
