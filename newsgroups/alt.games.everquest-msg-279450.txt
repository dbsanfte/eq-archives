I agree entirely. 

As the OP said:-

Thus, the *cover story*, from an *engineer's point of view*, is
regarded as the best such piece the OP's tech-savvy friends have seen.
Quite why Vladesch describes this as "hype" and wants us to look at
WoW I really don't know. It was just a technical article called
"Engineering Everquest" and no aspersions or comparisons were made
about or with any other game.
