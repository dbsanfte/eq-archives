I'm by no means a SoE basher. I never have been (well, there was that 
nasty period I went through as a suffering Master Droid Engineer in SWG, 
but we won't talk about that). I never subscribed to any of the wacky 
conspiracy theories that would be floated about everything from their 
vendetta against a particular class to their evil nature and 
manipulation of the customer base. I generally detest that attitude in 
the forums I frequent, as people tend to jump to it far too quickly and 
easily. I always tried to give SoE the benefit of the doubt, and they 
deserved it more times than not. I've always seen them as an 
establishment that has my best interests (and thereby their own as well) 
at heart.

That said, I do see their recent actions as short-sighted, blatantly and 
grossly hypocritical and greed-driven and that any subsequent actions 
against the IGE's of the world would just be more of the same. 

Suffice it to say, I now view them in a whole different (read: negative) 
light.
