There has recently been in this newsgroup some comprehensive Velious Faction
guides, which were extremely helpful and thanks to the guys who took the
time to write them.

But, as its so complicated and I'm not too bright, I'm still a bit confused.
So, I will put it to you guys to do the thinking for me. Which faction
should I be friends with?

I'm a 49 dark elf necro, rarely group, usually solo, in a guild but not an
Uber one. I want to go to Velious but scared incase I kill the wrong mob.

I want to go there for the quest armour but bear in mind that I will only be
questing for armour that can be achieved solo.

Is there anything else you need to know before I form my allegiance? (Oh, if
choosing 1 particular faction makes shopping / banking less convienient,
well, I'm not too bothered.)

I also want to go there for new solo opportunities. Any good places to solo
in Velious from 49-60 please (theres nothing in the hunting guides with
regard to Velious on the web)? I'm killing Seafuries in Ocean Of  Tears at
the mo. Will probably stay there till 52 as I'm trying to max my defence.

TIA
