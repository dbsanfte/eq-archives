i stopped playing this game for about six months, and when i can back and
started checking out my favorite eq website, eqprices and alakazzams, i
notice that they both only give very limited info and require cash for more.
what has happened to these great site,  know th need the money, and deserve
it, but what about us poor folk?
can anyone help me out with the PWs to get into these great sites again, or
direct me to a comperable website that will give me prices to loot and tell
me what drops what, especially in Lucilin where i have just begun to fight.
thanks
