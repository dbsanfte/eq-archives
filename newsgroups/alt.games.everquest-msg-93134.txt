I would have to disagree with this one...  Yes, Magicians are masters of
summoning - out of nothing at all...  They conjure food, elementals, water,
weapons, various magical items, etc...  but they don't conjure one item that
is already in another location (physically, on the map of Norrath) to their
location.  However, player corpses are dead...  This falls into the realm of
a Necromancer...  Necro's are masters of all things dead... :)

Now, before I get flamed, no I don't play a Necro...  Never could get into
it... :)
