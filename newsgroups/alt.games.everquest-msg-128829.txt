I'll be honest and say I don't know the "religious" aspect of things.
(Don't get me started on religion..  :^) ..).

I simply maintain that, regardless of what happened 50 years ago, 500
years ago or 5000 years ago....  Regardless of what happened in the
past, it does not justify terrorism.  It does not justify the specific
targeting and subsequent murder of innocent women and children who
were not even ALIVE at the time of the real or imagined transgression.

I am amazed that there are those who cannot understand such a simple
concept.

Going by their reasoning, 9/11 is "understandable and justified.  

How sad is THAT!!??

This isn't an issue about who belongs in what land or who oppresses
who. 

This is simply an issue of is terrorism EVER justified.  Is the
specific targeting and murder of innocent women and children EVER a
legitimate action of war??

The answer is obviously 'no'...
