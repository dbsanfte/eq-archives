further info:
There are different chat channels - you can chat privately using /tell
<character name> and /r to reply to a 'tell'.

You can /Shout for help  then if you get a response, take the ensuing
conversation to /tells.

You can also /ooc a question (out of character) but on the rathe server, the
diff between what is appropriate to /shout or /ooc is awfully grey...

There is also a chat channel when you're in a group /group that keeps the
groups chat private from non-members...

I'd suggest you start a basic character, maybe a barbarian warrior - they
have a nice newbie area and is still busy enough to get assistance for an
'old world' city - and dink around with him/her to get a basic feel of the
interface, basic controls, etc.

While you're playing the character, chat up other newbies (they are often
seasoned players starting a new character).  And holler you questions once
in awhile.  Most folk, when they find out you are truly new, will be
exceedingly helpful - even to the point of occasionally offering gifts of
basic weapons, armor or money...

As you gain levels and start to get the itch to travel, you'll find
www.eqatlas.com to be your friend...  from there, you can link to
everquest.allakhazam.com (sp?) which is laden with links and information....
many "how do I, what do I, where do I" questions can be answered here...

four last suggestions:

1. Always respect someone elses monster - don't run in to attack it (or
assist) without asking if they need help.

2. Always say thank you when someone gives you a gift of a spell, money, or
items.  Often common courtesy is forgotten, and their are players who EXPECT
assistance...  they really turn people off from offering again in the
future.

3.  Do unto others and pay it forward:  When you start to grow in level -
help other newbies and pass your old toys to them once awhile, instead of
always trying to sell old stuff...  Believe in EQ Karma...

4.  Start saving you real-life cash - you're gonna want to upgrade your
memory and video card really soon!
