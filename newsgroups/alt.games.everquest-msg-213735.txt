There are 5 spots with adventure givers and adventure merchants
near them, one for each theme.  The guy who gives out adventures
in Rujarkian Hills is in the EC tunnel next to shady.

Get a group of at least 4 people formed, and the leaderr goes
up to the adventure giver and right clicks him.  He chooses an
adventure type and normal or hard difficulty.

As soon as he accepts the adventure a new zone is created that
only the members of the party can get into.  You have a time
limit to get to the zone and enter.  This isn't a problem because
they tell you what zone your zone entrance is in (not very far
away) and a blue line is put on your compass pointing to the
entrance.

After you enter, you have a time limit to accomplish the objectives
of the adventure.  If you fail you have a little time left to 
look around the dungeon, if you succeed you havve about 20 minutes
left to look around.  When that time is up the dungeon disappears
and all bodies and living people are ejected to the zone entrance.

If, for any reason, you leave the dungeon you can go back anytime
until the dungeon disappears.  They have enough hardware in place
to handle 11,000 simultaneous dungeons, or about half of the peak
EQ population in groups of 4, or 2/3rds in groups of 6.
