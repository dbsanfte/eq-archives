Quick update. I'm off to buy the PCI card now, but first I tried EQ in
the current configuration with the textures setting changed to "low". I
was able to move about with no difficulty, even with the current crap
card, in a crowded EC tunnel and NFP bank. I think I'm back, even if
this new card tonight doesn't work out. Ok, so I won't see any of the
new textures, etc. that Verant gifted us with. Point is... I can tank
again and got invited on a PoA raid tomorrow. he he.
MUA HA HA
JAKUGG IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WOOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm going to the MOON, Alice........ to the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
