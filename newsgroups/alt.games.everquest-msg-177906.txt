Hmm, they must have just left trying to CS me at DL.  Those guys never say
anything, either, as the single handedly clear out the hut.  "Oh, sorry, I
didn't see you there."  ON THE PYRAMID, I'M SITTING ON THE TUNARE-DAMNED
PYRAMID AND YOU CAN'T SEE ME?  Sorry, where was I?

Heh, sheer brilliance, there.  I hope that was enough warning for you guys
to be on guard.

I've never had a problem with the bards, it's always the druids on the
Raithe who get things out of control.  Granted, I've only occasionally
witnessed swarm-kiting.  Never had a problem with wizards, either.
Sometimes it's fascinating to watch the precision with which they kill their
mobs (at least the good ones).  I still hate them for taking my undead
camps, but I've got to appriciate their skill.

BTW, why is it everyone wants to camp the undead, even knowing us poor
paladins are dependant on them?  Yeah, I know they have a right, it's just
frustrating to watch classes who could solo just about anywhere
(exaggeration noted) stick to the few places I can survive.
