You will not evade me, ryouseika <haha@ha.ha>:

>Actually... no. :) I did what you mention below.  Including the spellbook 
>(why use sit? hitting /book makes you sit automatically)

I'm big. I like to watch my surroundings while I med :)

I don't have problems with casting the wrong spells, since most of
them pretty much have their assigned slots when they're used. I'm more
worried about accidentally taunting an NPC when I play my tanks and
press the hotkey number that makes my casters sit down :)

I don't think I have EVER gone without my heal spell memmed. (It's
sometimes gone for 30 seconds while I mem and cast a cure or regen,
but that's all)
Try to figure out a spell setup you'd want to use in combat and
variations of it (mine swaps out nukes and dots after how fast the
kills are, for instance), and try to keep it memmed most of the time.
Sow and heal should definitely be parts of it - they're the spells
that might get you killed if you have to sit down to memorize on the
run. In dungeons, you might want gate instead of sow :)
You seem a little too fond of levitate - make the slot you have that
in a general buff slot for swapping in less vital buffs. 
As a 45 druid, 5 of my 8 slots are virtually always the same spells,
and I have maybe 4 configurations for the remaining 3 slots. Buffs and
port spells are swapped into whatever slot is convenient at the time,
and I very rarely have to even check what spells I have memorized
where.
