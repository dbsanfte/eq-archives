Depends on your stamina, if it's relatively high, go with a Centi longsword
(2k), if not, then you can grab a short sword (800-1k on the Raithe).  Those
will keep you going for quite a while (dual wield them); Splitarrow, our
resident ranger is using his Centi well into the 50's, so they're cheaper in
the long run, since you won't be upgrading at a loss... until the next
expansion.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
