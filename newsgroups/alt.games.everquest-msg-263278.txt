Kromriff blood is easy enough to solo at your level. I had my druid in there 
solo'ing from 58. Come in invis all the way to the front door of the manor.. 
then pop invis kill wanderer first, then work your way in, you can single 
pull em all day if you just go slow and hang to the right wall when you 
enter the manor.
they root/rot well (it really helps if you have your warden symbol of tunare 
of course)
Ulthork tusks are actually really easy, charm a pet, buff em, and let em 
eat..
As for the swordfish, I actually don't know and haven't tried, but being as 
I'm on the 4th shawl, I would love any input about how to solo that 
encounter.
as for the molkor, get a mage friend to help you, he can malo so your dots 
and debuffs will stick, while you keep his pet CHed so he can be nuking. 
just remember to use the air pet (for stuns) because they CH themselves.. a 
lot.
