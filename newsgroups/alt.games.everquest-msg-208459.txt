I hadn't heard this item based level based haste effect rumor that you are
talking about (and seem to have observed), but I did hear that the cap to haste
is based on your level, instead of the 100 haste that many people assume is the
target of their item haste plus spell haste combination.  If that cap is very
low at very low levels, then you might see no difference between a 10% haste
item and a 20% haste item... if this theory is correct, then the small hastes
that shaman and enchanters get at low levels might still be useless on twinks,
who already have their haste at the cap from some kind of 22% or 41% haste item.

Since keeping melee hasted is a big chunk of mana, those people might want to
know about this effect.  Since its a big reason they get invited into groups,
they might be better off if noone else finds out about it.

Of course if you are correct and its the items themselves that give different
effects based on your level (possibly level and class) then thats a whole other
ball game.

Llyric, 57 bard, haste song and "over the cap" haste song
Paax, 51 shaman haste caster
Matte, 30 enchanter haste caster

(to demonstrate a vested interest in not finding out)
