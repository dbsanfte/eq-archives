Yes you can.

I've reinstalled my pc several times now. I keep EQ on my data disk
(together with a load of MP3's and other crap) which hasn't been reformatted
or re-installed for quite some time.
After every OS re-install I just made a shortcut to everquest.exe on my
desktop and started playing. No fuss, no worry.
