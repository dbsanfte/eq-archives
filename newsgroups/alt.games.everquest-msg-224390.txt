Well, my main is a melee who's had root and used it often since L22
(more often than stun until I was 50 or so).  If regular melee damage
breaks root the chance is very near zero, less than that of a 5hp DD.
Many (most? all?) Necro pets have a lifetap proc, lifetaps are DD+Heal,
DD gives a chance to break root that appears to be increased by the
damage the spell does (not sure if potential or actual).  Sean says in
his post that he thinks Bash breaks root, I doubt that is true, but
I'll admit the possibility as I have rarely melee'd a rooted mob with
a shield equipped.  AFAICT, regular melee, projectiles, and DoT per
tick damage don't break root.  Any DD damage, including DD damage from
Shaman (and Necro?) DoTs, gives a shot at breaking root.

Take care to use same level mobs and root caster for each test run
(identical mobs, for that matter), as relative levels of caster/mob
and MR of mob affect every resist check, both initial and break.
