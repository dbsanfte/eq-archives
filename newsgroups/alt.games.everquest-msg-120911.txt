Hi,

They offerered me a free trial, i did the 450meg download, entered my key
but it said i was not subscribed to anything so i emailed on the 3rd of
June, still nothing so i emailed them

Hello,

I am so exited that you answered my email (NOT). As a possible customer I
emailed on the 3rd of June to help with the free trial offer you gave me, it
is now the 6th and not has been heard except an automated confirmation
email. I really hope that the people that pay for this service do not have
this type of service.

The world of everquest is rumoured to offer so much but I am yet to see what
they are all talking about.

Disapointed

Regards,


Darren
