OOPS, I misread your post.  I thought you had tried setting cards gamma, not
game's.  Sorry.

Also, I checked.  Frogloks have "ultravision".  Don't know if there is a
difference between this and other races "infravision".  I haven't played one
yet.

Looking at the system requirements, you have the memory, but your "Rage"
card may not support all the lighting modes of the newer "Radeon" cards,
which are fully supported.  Maybe someone else has better information.

Cheers,
Eric
