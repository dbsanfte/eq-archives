I'm with you on this 100%.  Umbriel probably doesn't have the best set of
powers for a Defender.  I just keep choosing the powers that seem fun.  =)
I've had people tell me I need to get the Teleport series of powers because
teleporting someone in danger of dying to your side so you can heal them
will be important.  But I don't wanna... I want to get Super-Jump!  I want
to literally be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.  Bouncy!  =)
