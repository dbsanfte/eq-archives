Main reason 90% of my playing time since 34 with Shammy has been solo and
I'm now 55.  I'll level the shammy until I can't solo any longer.  Couldn't
get my Wiz past 40 or Mage past 38 because it was so difficult to solo
without huge amounts of down time.... pre-KEI... and occassional deaths due
to adds.  Now with KEI I'll go back to the Wiz after I stop leveling the
shammy and probably get him up into the lower 50's...  with the shammys help
of course (2 seperate accounts on 2 different machines).  With my shammy,
wiz and wifes druid I'll never be lfg again!  TG!!!
