a lot of the early ones only had 64K (or even less) What happened was
they put the operating system memory way up near 1meg  ( 768K to 1M or
something like that.  Or there was 1k at address 0 that was for the
boot program.  The area between 640 and 768 was used for expanded
memory where pages of memory were moved in and out from a bank of
memory.  
Bank of America defines chintzy IMHO.  
Email for details.
