  I've always viewed rangers simply as rugged outdoorsy types, in another
RPG I play (where roleplaying is a "bigger deal" and more expected than it
is in EQ) I choose to make my ranger character a hunter who had no qualms
whosever about killing animals and actually took great pride in his hunting
skills.  With that character I always preferred hunting wild animals in
pristine outdoor environments instead of crawling my way through dungeons
and haunted mansions.

  But anyway, there are no faction hits for killing animals around Freeport,
nor are there faction hits for killing animals around Qeynos/Surefall.  You
will get bad faction hits with the Surefall factions if you kill the bears
inside Surefall Glade itself, but that's it.
