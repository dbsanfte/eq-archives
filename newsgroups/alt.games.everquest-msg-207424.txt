There are at least 3 posts of folks saying they got their drop this way,
so I'm hopeful. :)

OK, I have a dumb question.  I actually HATE pulling..my husband loves
it...but I have the harmony and track, so I succumb to necessity.  But it
does mean I haven't learned all the nuances of pulling.  WHen you say
"very very hard", that implies that there are factors that effect one's
chances.  Is it where I stand?  What I use (spell vs arrow)? Or just
sheer, dumb luck?  I know vaguely that there are two kinds of aggro...the
mob aggroing because you are in it's range, and because you harmed it's
friend.  These mobs have both kinds, I take it?

*nod slowly* Thanks for the detailed info...I'm starting to get an
"idea" based on this, actually.  We'd need to get a strong feel for the
mobs/zone with the other wings, so we'd know if we were able to ramp up
the challenge...but if we can find a way to safely pull/hunt those 4,
that's all we need to get his skull(s).

The door after the first two spawns isn't one way, is it?  THe map I have
doesn't indicate a one-way door there, just further in there is the one
from south, and the one that goes deeper into east.  If it isn't one way,
I could fight near those two spawns, rather than near the one-way wall
with a golem behind it.

I think it would have been my favorite if one of us had been an evaccer,
or we had a regular evaccing friend. :)  Part of why I want to go now is
just so I can see it for once, in case the revamp is something horrible.

OK...fair enough...that wouldn't be a screw up...just damned inconvenient.
:P Still, if folks wanted to XP here again, then getting a group to go
with is that much easier.
