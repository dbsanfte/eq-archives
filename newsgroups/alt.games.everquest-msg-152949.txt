I'd like to add a modifier to that...

Only add the top 5 or so from the hate list to the boot list.

Why? Well... if your guild's tanks are drawing the agro, and a rival guild
sends in their manaburn crew to KS you, your tanks and/or clerics are now
precluded from your 2nd attempt while they wait out their banishment time...
without even getting the benefit of the drops.

Doing it this way would also allow the larger guilds who have no competition
on their own server to 'semi' monopolise a particular mob by rotating their
Puller, MA, SA, CH-chain amongst the different members...
