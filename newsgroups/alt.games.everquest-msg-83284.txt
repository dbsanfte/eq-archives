I have a P3 *00, 128MB of RAM, and a 64MB GeForce. I'll be upgrtading my
memory soon to get better performance out of SoL, and I was wondering if
anyone had teh reccommended 512MB. If so, how does thew game perform? Are
you able to view all the new character models?

Thnaks in advance for any help.
