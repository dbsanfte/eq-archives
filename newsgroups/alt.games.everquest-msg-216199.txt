It's not always that cut and dry though. There's often times (after a
buff cycle or serious overpull) when a cleric at 30% is fine. You
tell the puller to make sure he pulls singles until you build up your
mana buffer again. Only works with a good puller of course. Also, what
if you have a backup healer in the group? I'll often take over main
heal duties from a druid or cleric for a few pulls when they get LoM. 

It really depends on how good your puller is. If it's someone I know
and trust I'll tell them "30m, no complicated pulls for a few", not
"30m, med break!". 

Rgds, Frank
