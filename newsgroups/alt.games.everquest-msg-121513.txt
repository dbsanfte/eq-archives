I've seen jokes about this patch claiming Verant really meant NPC
caster balancing when they talked about caster balancing :)

Problems with the focus items: There is a slew of them for lower end
effects, but as soon as people start using 49+ spells, there's almost
nothing. All three of my casting alts, even my hapless enchiemule with
a total of 3 non-cloth items, had several focus items (granted, my
mage has a necro pet robe and two dot enhancing items, and will have
to get summoning haste gloves off enchiemule, but she'll have mana
preservation 2 as soon as my druid hands back the former extended
affliction 3 item). My main character has range 3 and extended
affliction 2, both on her resist gear. And unlike Rastus, I use almost
exclusively 49+ spells, except when I am porting.
The items are strange, and while some of the ridiculous items like
testament of vanear and sarnak arcane fetish have been rectified,
other items are just as whacked or have been changed to whacked.
A no drop aviak charm off a 25+ mob has a level 1 effect, as does a
mammoth hide cloak and medicine totem. The kael dropped book of
tactics and silver dragon tattoo have level 2 effects, as do DN
dropped flayed paebala gloves, necklace of superiority, the di'zok
begirding from Chardok, and the shadel bandit ring. Not only are none
of these effects level appropriate, but it's not even always on the
kind of stuff people of those levels will want (few casters have high
enough int/wis to prefer a shadel ring till their 50s).
Circlet of Summer, a 10 wis NToV hat, has summoning efficiency 3.
Priestly pet owners, rejoice! Kobold Jester Crown, a - 30 int item,
has summoning haste 3. (Mages, don't worry about the mana chunk you'll
lose when you swap in that hat, because your pet will cast so much
faster!) Crown of resiliance, one of the best all/all resist items I
know of, has a necro pet effect. And Neverdaria's left eye, primarily
a melee range item (right eye is more caster stats) and hence pretty
much only on melees, has mana preservation 3.  Mask of fall, with 7
int and no wis, has improved healing 3 (makes even less sense than
idol of underking, a Yael drop with some str and 20hp/mana and nothing
else, having the same effect. Oh, and the third known improved healing
item is shroud of Veeshan, from VP). And WHY would anyone even *dream*
of putting a focus on Frakadar's talisman?

Overall, I give them a B on level 1 items, B- on level 2 items, and a
D- on level 3 items. If the intention was to introduce focus items in
a way that wouldn't make people rush to exchange or downgrade the gear
they already have, they failed, at least for many of the level 3 items
which in many cases are a slap in the face put on an item a benefiting
class would never normally roll for.
And personally, I'll just wait and see if they manage to sort out the
level 3 effects more satisfactory before I even think about getting
something with a focus effect.
