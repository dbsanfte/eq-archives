Do you perhaps have the Damage Shields message off?  Because many
people do, since they will constantly be spammed by their group mates'
DS otherwise.

Go to Chardok with your DS message on and you'll find it hard to read
the rest of the battle DS will spam by so fast, easily half the mobs have
one.  Sebelis too is packed with DS casting mobs, and remember that
NPCs will cast buffs on each other.

I had DS on for a while recently (after hitting 56 for MOK) and eventually

decided to turn it off... so very many  mobs have DS that its easier just
to MoK them all

DS won't prevent you from killing most mobs, what it will do is get
all the tanks injured, instead of just the MA, and add substantially to
the damage rate on the MA.  Need to heal the MA more often, and
need to heal anyone else -at all- and you get an unhappy healer, who
really really wants to heal as little as possible; periodic Cheal on
the main tank, as far apart as is possible, thats what _I_ want to see
