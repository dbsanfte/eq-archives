You can easily reach 26 in paladul caverns, after that I'd
suggest Marus Seru, where the Rockhoppers should be decent prey
at first, and the slightly harder other mobs in the zone in a
level or two will carry you to 30.  South Karana is an
alternative, but the distances are annoying, even with a port to
NK and SOW.  At 30, most people seem to go to either Overthere or
Dawnshroud Peaks, both are easy to get to (OT in particular is
reachable directly via POK stone).  Personally, DSP is too laggy
to play in, so I have more limited choices if I want to find a
group.

Another nice option recently introduced are the LDoN dungeons; at
"normal" these seem to be pretty reliably doable by any full
group, nice experience and loot... but not really good for duos.

Splendid
