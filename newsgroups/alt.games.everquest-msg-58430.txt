I am fully aware of the difference in how easy it is to raise the skill.  I
am currently working on tailoring myself.  My point was that the reason I
took up any trade skills had very little to do with the gear I could produce
by doing so, but rather was in order to enhance my game experience.  Yes, I
know that I am likely going to be very sick of trying to raise tailoring.
