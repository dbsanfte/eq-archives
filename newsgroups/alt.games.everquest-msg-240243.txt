I'm not sure how you missed it. The first attempt was discussed
here, the second attempt seemed to have announcers everywhere I
went with play by play provided in ooc, shout, and guild chat. :)

I, myself, got mega-entertainment out of the screen shots that
were up on one of the guilds' website. I'm not sure why, but
screenshots of lots of corpses lying around a rampaging dragon
hits my funny bones. :P
