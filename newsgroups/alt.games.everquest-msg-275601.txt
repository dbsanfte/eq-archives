>So what is the most capable character to solo?

A Beastlord might be easy one.  You can heal yourself in downtime and
if you're in a tight spot, you can leavce your summoned pet behind to
tank while you run for the zone.  Although other classes have pets,
Beastlord have the advantage of pet only buffs that makes their pet a
whole lot more powerful than comparable level pet.

Shadowknight is another possibility, they tank well and can heal if
needed plus pet summons (useless as they are, it has saved my brother
a few times)

Most of EQ gameplay is not really about soloing but about socializing
and working in a teamwork to accomplish a task.  Try it, put lfg up
and get grouped.
