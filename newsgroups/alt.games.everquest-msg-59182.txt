*snort* Uh, because this is RvR warfare, not football? Football has
rules and such - so does warfare if you want a snowballs chance of
victory. You may want to play warfare in a game to your own rules, me I
like to win, so I'll use several thousand years of teaching and not be so
foolish as to treat simulated warfare any differently than real
warfare. You think attacking from ambush and with overwhelming numbers
isn't fun? It's WAR you fucking imbecile. Me I want to win...

1: If our forces are ten to the enemy's one, surround him.
2: If five to one, attack him.
3: If twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.
4: If equally matched, we can offer battle.
5: If slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy.
6: If quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.

All of this can be summed up with "He will win who, prepared himself,
waits to take the enemy unprepared."

From "The Art of War", Sun Tzu, 2,400+ years ago. The rules apply both
then and now - to both real warfare or simulated (game). Ignore them and
lose. Losing sucks. I play to win.
