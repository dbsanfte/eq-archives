I love KEI. The most ive made selling it was just over 10k in an
hour. Then I just turn around and buy it with my alts (all of whom have
a horse) when I play them. Its a free market. Love it or leave it.
If you boot a cleric from a group because they take 2 minutes to go
buy some C (instead of spending 5 minutes medding) then youre group is
gonna be standing there ooc'ing "Group seeking healer without KEI" while
the cleric is busy getting some xp.
