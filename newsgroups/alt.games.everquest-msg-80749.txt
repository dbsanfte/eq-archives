The emptiness of MM is certainly in some ways bad, but it is also good (less
people to bring trains :-) ).  But yes the main difference in population is
the lack of decent loot in MM.

First of all I see a lot of people saying you should be 45 before you start
on frenzy, and certainly the higher you are the better, but I was often in
there with higher levels before 40.  If your group at 40 had a couple of
extra tanks that were 45+ then you could take it OK, once again dependent
upon the way you do things :-).  As for the Crested Spaulder they drop from
the Avenging Caitiff in the secret stairway behind the jail.  Random? but
not overly rare spawn I believe.

Not even a chanter likes the job of having to stop a mob in its tracks -
that's why you taunt before breaking mez.  :-)  Sure, f you can get a
chanter/bard then do so, but if one isn't available don't let that stop you
from having an effective group.  That is why I say learn to adapt.

Maybe, AoE might be jsut as effective a crowd control for where you are
currently.  But sure, try new things out and take the best.
