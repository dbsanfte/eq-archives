Enchanter pets only attack when the enchanter is attacked. No /pet attack
command. If the enchanter pet is working a lot, it means the chanter is
geting hit a lot, which is probably not what a low level chanter will be
trying to do. Ive had no troubles soloing at 52 tho, as the level 49
animation totally kicks ass (with SLTW and a second weapon). I expect ill be
able to make faster xp soloing than doing my normal chanter bit...mezzing,
hasting and claritying.
