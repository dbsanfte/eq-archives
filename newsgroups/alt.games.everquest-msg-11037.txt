But not long enough to notice that contrary to your implication
that double attack and disarm are something that set a Warrior
apart from a Paladin, in fact Paladins actually do get those
skills as well.  That was my only point -- that you hadn't played
your Paladin long enough to discover that Paladins get those
skills also.  Nor had you played her long enough (IMNSHO) to
fully appreciate how much of an advantage Paladin spells give
to the class, because the low-level Paladin spells are not nearly
as useful or powerful as the ones that are acquired at higher
levels.

Nothing wrong with that.

I have no problem with you having a personal view point.  Enjoy.


>And i will dismiss my pallys spells.

And I will express my own "personal view point", which is to
disagree that they are worth dismissing.  The higher a Paladin
gets, the more versatile and powerful his spells, to the point
where they make a very significant difference in the effectiveness
of a Paladin.  I admit that the lower-level Paladin spells are,
for the most part, "shrug-worthy".

Of course.  A Paladin's healing, especially at lower levels, is
one of the least reasons to appreciate them.

Why not?  It has always worked great for me.

More power to you.  Everyone has their own preferences.
That's why not everyone plays the same one class and leaves the
other 13 unused.

>attack on my warrior.

That's fine, but don't expect it to go uncorrected when you imply that
"double attack" and "disarm" are reasons to choose a Warrior over a
Paladin, when in fact Paladins do get those skills as well.


>Don't get so defesive.

I'm not defensive in the least.  I was correcting one mischaracterization
about Paladins, lest someone mistakenly choose one class over the
other based on a misconception, and I was additionally stating my
own "personal view point" about the value of a Paladin's spells,
which happens to disagree with your view of those spells.

You had a chance to state your view, and then I chose to express
mine since it offered a differing viewpoint.  Nothing defensive about
it.
