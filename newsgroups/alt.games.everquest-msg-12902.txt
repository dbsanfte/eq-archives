	According to some quasi-inside info, they were accused of
exploiting because the GM who witnessed the incident felt that the
Clerics involved were positioned in such a way as to make themselves
completely untouchable by the 4th Warder.  This is despite the fact
that the 4th Warder can summon anyone he feels like pummelling if he
can't actually reach them.

	According to the same quasi-inside info, one of the EQ
developers has seen logs of the fight, and discovered that the 4th
Warder was engaged in melee the entire fight.  He wasn't meleeing the
*clerics*, but that's not because he *couldn't*.  He was, apparently,
more interested in other folks.
