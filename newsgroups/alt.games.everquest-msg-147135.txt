My god, you really are pathetic. YOu really do get off on playing
schoolyard bully, don't you? You go to any desperate means to start an
argument. Biz, you're a fucking troll. You're a coward who'd never
pull half the bullshit you do here because you'd have to deal with the
real consequences.

Grow up. This isn't preschool anymore.

Goodbye.
