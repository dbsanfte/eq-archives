This is hard to show with a logfile, since it won't show DoTs and all, but 
it's pretty well accepted that on mobs with a lot of hitpoints, it's only 
the final 10-20% that are counted.  This made necros with good timing and 
splurt really good at killstealing for a while.  
Remember, originally it was the killshot that determined who got the 
experience; then they changed it to whomever did the most damage, so a 
single wizard, mage, rogue, etc could KS an entire group; then finally 
they started awarding it to the unit (single person or group) who did the 
most damage.  I am sure that there is a good technical reason why it can't 
keep the entire stack, probably something having to do with the fact that 
at 100pt per attack, the stack would have to be at least 1000 entries deep 
for a <foo>bane mob.  Probably closer to 2-3000 entries deep on the bigger 
mobs.  That's a HUGE stack.
