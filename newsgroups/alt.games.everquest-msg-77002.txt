I would have thought that would be easy to solve. Create a new item, a bank
note, make it 1k 10k and 100k values, buys and sells for same rate has no
weight, is stackable and can be traded with merchants as well transferrable
to players, although spending the 100k note on a Stack of rations could
cause some problems.
Of course this would take a bit more work than just making a zone with no
falling damage and speed penalties for encumberance. On top of this it would
likely get a no Rent Tag and a lot of plat would vanish into the ether...ok,
maybe not such a good idea for Verant to do but I think it would be a far
better solution.
EQ is the only game of the top 3 (EQ, AC, DAoC) that has encumberance for
money (AC had to remove it eventually as it was possible to die thru
encumberance and you were once able to dump money on another player without
consent) I know that DAoC has a vault/bank system and I believe that AC
introduced one as well (to try and get rid of the heavy use of Mules) so
their system of storage isn't far from EQ's. I don't think that money should
be weightless but I do believe there should be some solution to it.
My trading mule with Storm str and SoW carrying 8k moves at a slower than
walking pace so what 50k is like I cannot imagine (would like to find out
tho ;ï¿½))
