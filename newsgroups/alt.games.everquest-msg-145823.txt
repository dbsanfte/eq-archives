This is a massive change to the cleric pet, long a laughingstock of the
pet world.  Chopping its cast cost more than in half makes it far less
likely you'll be sorry you bothered casting it.  In a short test someone
ran in another thread, pet did between 2000 and 2700 points of
damage over a two and a half minute fight, at 250 mana (180 mana more
or less with an enshrouded veil on) this is one nice little DOT.
The cast time of 2.5 seconds makes it much more practical, too,
now you can probably channel one while being beat on, or reliably
get one cast and locked on target if target is being kited or fear kited...
previously it took some planning or a partner to get pet out and not
dead.

As an experienced UHOF user, I'll suggest getting a pair of Donals
Vambraces, and slapping Valor up on your pet once its out.  The
biggest liability to the hammer is its incredibly low hp total.  Valor
for free means that if your pet gets aggro for a blow or two, it probably
lives.  On the other hand, this free advice is worth about what its
costing you; with the lower cost you won't care as much when your
pet does happen to die.

I'm also looking into the feasibility of casting Heroism and Marzin
on the little guy, so I can back out of melee, heal myself, and
dive back in, like a beastlord (only with real heals) relying on
pet to tank long enough to get the heal cast cleanly.

Oh, also note, new graphic on the pet, much more visible now,
looks like Righteousness in there swinging instead of that slim
little bit of nothing they used to see.
