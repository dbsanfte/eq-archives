OK, I'll admit,I haven't been paying attention when this game was brought
up.  If you know Foxeye you know she doesn't like ugly character models,
and I always found DAOC kinda blah.

But, oh my, they are redoing their models. And what I've seen looks
*good*.  Like...Lineage2 without the skank.  Properly shaped people with
pleasing faces, though not especially cutting edge technology...fine by
me!

Anyhow, like I said, I haven't been paying attention.  So I have a basic
question about this game...is it friendly to:

1. duos
2. fashion monkeys
3. people who want an in-game community more
like what EQ has, as opposed to CoH or Lineage 2 (strangers passing in the
night)

Obviously the game has staying power and content, and a LOT of race
choices.  And stuff decays...I think...but I don't care about that.
