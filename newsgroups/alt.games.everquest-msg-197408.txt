Years ago, when I was a young tabletop RPG playing geek (as opposed to now, when
I'm an old MMRPG playing frood) I spent  quite some time drawing up an elaborate
deck plan and external view of a starship for a Travellor campaign.

The ship's name was blazoned on every page, and on the folder itself in  inch
high lettering.

Rouge Star.

I just about got laughed out of the school when I pulled that out and started
setting up the adventure I'd written.

To this day, however, I can remember how to spell Rogue properly.
