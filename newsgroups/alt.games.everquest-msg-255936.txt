Lots of speculation here but no definitive answers because no one who has
answered really knows the answer. It's obviously the most critical piece of
information relating to the security of your account and how exactly it's
managed is not common or public knowledge, and that's the way it should
remain.

There are ways to manage authentication without storing a password at all so
it's not guaranteed to be stored on the servers. But I can tell you one
thing for certain: it's *not* stored anywhere on the client.
