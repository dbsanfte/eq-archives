Yup, Absolutely.  Same with the borrowing of armor and other trade
scams.  Ditto for /auc /shouting for someone to help you transfer items
to another character.  Now, someone walks up to you and hands you
something.  You are under no obligation.  But if they shout for
asssistance, and you consent.  you are bound to return the items.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
