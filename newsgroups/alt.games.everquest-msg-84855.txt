Split is massively broken. Casters and healers do not get "their share" 
from splitting, because split does not make change. Example:

We have a group of 4 people. We slay Mob X and it drops 3 plat 7 gold 5 
silver and 8 copper. You loot the corpse and you get 3p4g2s2c while 
everyone else gets 0p1g1s2c.

FFFA (Friendly Free For All) is a better way to do it... I loot 1/x mobs, 
where X = number of p[eople in group.

Not to mention split is VERY unpopular with monks.
