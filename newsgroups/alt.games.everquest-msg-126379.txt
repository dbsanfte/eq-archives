    Guildmate was testing Extended Affliction out, casting Funeral Pyre on
both himself and later on NPCs. He could not discern a difference in total
damage done. Apparently some discussion of this is going on at the
necromancer boards, but for now it looks broken. (Necromancers were very
interested in Extended, not only because of all the DoTs they have but
because of what one DoT, Splurt, was theorized to do if Extension worked.)
