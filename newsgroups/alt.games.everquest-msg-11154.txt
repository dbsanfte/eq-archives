My sister has a P200 with 64 megs of RAM and a TNT card. She is satisfied,
although she has not used a great PC yet.

When I started, I used a P2/333 with a voodoo2 and 64 mb of RAM. It worked
great.

My wife is now using a P3/550 with the same old voodoo2, and I am STILL
satisfied with it(the voodoo2 that is).

We do not have any expansions, though.

Log in! have fun! upgrade later!
