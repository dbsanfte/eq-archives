SK is a good class.  I've never played one myself, but I've partnered
and grouped with them quite a few times.  Depending on how and where
you like to play... I had a lot of fun partnerring a Warrior with an
Iksar SK in late teens thru mid twenties in LOIO.  The down-time was
manageable because the Warrior was well enough geared to solo so
after bandaging to half (when hurt) the SK would use his HP transfer
pseudo-heal to get me a few more HP and then rest while I pulled.  The
SK added good damage in the fights and could grab agro if I was being
beat upon too much when we had adds, and even the cheesy 'tap he had
allowed him to heal himself some while dropping the mobs faster
(unlike "real" casters hybrids do not have their melee timer reset on
a successful cast, so fast casting spells are very nice).

Until they added the BL the SK was the best all-around soloer amongst
the hybrids (Rangers can do some nice work in outdoor zones with
animals, but when you see a Ranger solo in a dungeon it's pretty
liekly that he's pharming greens).

Good Luck!  :)
