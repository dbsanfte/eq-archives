the gobs in HK should start being mostly blu to ya in the WR....but
still red in the RR; since HK is mostly overlookd by ppl who wanna be
on Luclin hunting in DSP at that lvl....U can usually have both rooms
to yurself (I remem being 4th on the waiting list to get into a
WR-grp......./sigh).

that being said U could also try getting a grp in RM killing cyclopes
& giant skellies near the RM-LR zone ent.  its also concievable that U
can get a giant-grp their...but dont count on it.

the BR or ass/sup in Lguk.....'Nuff Said.

spectres in Oasis if U got a snarer.......

if U can get a grp together....go for Runnyeye.

btw- chant-kiting at yur lvl would take TOO damnd long....I dont
recommend it.
