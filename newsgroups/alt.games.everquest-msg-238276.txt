I have a 59 Iksar SK who has been dubious in OT since level 45 or so
from killing about 400+ Sarnaks Berserkers in OT and turning the
braids in. He has the gate hammer, and has no problem banking in OT,
but selling he cant yet (still dubious). Of course this means avoiding
KC at all costs (he actually can go there and stand next to the
Drolvargs there (dubious), but the Spectrals are KoS still. It can be
done just takes time and either a chanter or a lot of illusion potions
for the turn ins. Of course my Sarnak faction needs work and have been
in Droga a lot to repair (and also hand in salts and skins at
Chardock).
