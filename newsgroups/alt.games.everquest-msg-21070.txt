No more than a month ago I went to the Swamp of No Hope to help a druid,
shaman, cleric, and 3 monks take down Ulump (epic guy).

Now, I can't swear to it, but I ASSUME that the cleric gave them all the
buffs he could, including Symbol (of Marzin, probably...the cleric was level
59).

Two dead monks down, I was chain casting Rune V on the remaining monk while
the shaman, druid, and cleric (all LOM, especially the cleric since she
rezzed the 2 other monks during the fight) were also doing their best to
keep him alive.   I didn't get the "does not take hold" message and I
SERIOUSLY doubt if my level 52 Rune spell OVERWROTE a cleric's 54 spell.

But no, I can't swear to it.  I haven't done any tests...I just think I'd've
heard by now some complaining if that were the case. :)  I also can't swear
to it, but if anyone gets Rune, it's usually ME, and I THINK I'd notice and
remember if I get the message that the cleric had just wasted a peridot on
me. *shrug*   And I'm too broke to test it for sure...21p is a lot of money
to me at 52 just to verify that I'm right. :)
