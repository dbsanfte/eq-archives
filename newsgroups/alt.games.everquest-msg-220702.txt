 >So how do you roleplay?

My ranger cringes when forced to kill natural animals. Any
of them. While she finds it required at times, she doesn't
enjoy it. She agonizes when forced to watch a friend get
injured or killed by an animal she feels absolutely pro-
hibited from killing, but her friends all know this is a
possibility when with her. OTOH, she gleefully slaughters
the unnatural evils that are hiding in animallike bodies.
Recently, she was able to get her surname changed to reflect
her purpose so far on Norrath and now gladly wears the
moniker of 'Griffonbane'. She spends lots of time in NK
getting her revenge against those twin terrors, GrimFeather
and the Silver Griffon and will one day have evened the
score with those two. She uses her foraging skills to keep
her friends supplied with items they can't easily find for
themselves and has extended her feelings of stewardship to
her Norrath family. (She is also extremely ashamed of the
fact that she must share a campsite with her necromancer
son and can't quite figure out how a dark elf necro could
spring from her half elf loins, but figures it will one day
be explained to her.)
