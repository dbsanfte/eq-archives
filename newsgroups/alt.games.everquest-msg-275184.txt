I wouldn't call the penalty 'pretty high'.  It is fairly common to be
able to get rid of your debt, even after a wipe, fairly quickly.  If
all penalties from the 'pretty high price for making a mistake in
grouping' are erased within 30 minutes of the penalty being incurred
(barring catastrophe), I don't think it qualifies as being a pretty
high price.  Heck, it even erodes over time when you are logged off.
