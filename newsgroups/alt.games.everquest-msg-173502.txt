Level in a week?  Shit.  If I level in 3 weeks, I'm lucky.  I do too much 
exploring, helping, raiding ( recently ), alt'ing, tradeskilling, etc. to 
level in a week.

I'm going to be working in Seb for some gem drops and in velks for the 
shawl 5 parts and in The Hole so that our guild gets to know the zone 
better.  If I get EXP, great!  If the bar barely moves, then that's the way 
it goes.  Thanks for the replies.
