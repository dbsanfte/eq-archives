|Bull#$%^....10s OF THOUSANDS of people will play SWG. How many

	Technically speaking: they could generate a specific combination of skill
levels that will activate force sensitivity for each character.  IE, if you
have 59 Blaster, 90 Pilot and 21 Basket-Weaving, you suddenly become force
sensitive, but your friend needs 89 Tracking, 46 Electronics and 59 Singing.

	Since there will probably be a large number of skills, this could generate
more combinations than the expected number of PCs, and the vast majority of
players would never hit their Magic Numbers.  However, it would also mean that
force sensitivity would effectively be random, which would make Jedi accounts
a commodity (remember, one 'toon per account).  In that case the best thing
you could do if you suddenly found your character was force sensitive would be
to sell it -- and anyone you see in game playing a Jedi almost certainly will
have bought the character.

	Exacerbating the situation: reports I've heard say that SOE has no
intention of even TRYING to balance Jedi against other professions.

	It is a catch-22.  If the process for becoming a Jedi is at all
deterministic, it will be found and exploited at will.  If becoming a Jedi is
arbitrary, they become a commodity and will be sold -- and all hardass
blathering aside, SOE will never, never stop the accounts from being traded.
As Castrovalva pointed out, they are "fighting a war of trade restrictions no
government has ever won".  If they had stuck to the original plan and not
allowed Jedi as PCs they'd have disappointed a lot of people and probably lost
sales, which is probably why they changed their minds.  If they had made the
Jedi profession elective and balanced it against the other professions they'd
likely have disappointed nearly as many people, even though we just saw Jango
Fett battle Kenobi to a draw and kill another unnamed Jedi in single combat in
Episode 2.

	Basically, they're screwed.
