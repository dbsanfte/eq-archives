I accept both your positions, but still do not feel satisfied. It's mostly a
personal matter, you can say - in my student days (I'm 50) challenging rules
and authorities used to be considered a good thing - even if it took a
personal experience to begin to do so, and if it went with a dose of
whining.

And I do not see any reason to think the situation has much changed, you
know.
