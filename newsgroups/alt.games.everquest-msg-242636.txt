Ok a couple things first. 
- I wrote this at the end of a bad day at work. That is not an
apology, but just to let you know I was aggravated anyway.
- This was probably the most hostile post I have ever written.
- I was responding to the original poster (ie not you as in "Ben"), i
figured it was an easy target. I went back and reread my post and I
can see how it seems I replied to you. You may or may not believe me..
I didn't even know you played an enchanter. I doubt there is a way to
prove what I'm saying - I don't really care, but I wanted to let you
know I was not attacking you.

It certainly struck a nerve. I hate people that bitch about the game
so much that it takes away from playing and having fun. Don't get me
wrong I love a good group that works well together, but I don't want
to play the subordinate in a dictatorship either. I know how to work
well in group with others and sometimes that means not doing things
the way T think they are done best. But this guy was over the top, I
would not stay in a group with someone like that.

They'd still somehow have to get to level 60, but I suppose you could
PL someone to that point... either way it set me off because of the
attitude.

Yeah, but I think that's an invalid deduction. Why wouldn't a good
enchanter occasionally spend a half hour buffing in PoK and have hot
keys for it?

Yeah but it's way cocky. EVERY player is expected to do that. Unless
I'm missing something and enchanters are the gods of EQ, this is a
rude comment at best.

Ok enchanters may be the most common victim of bad players messing up
in a group (although i'm not sure about that). But I'm saying that if
he instead explained what he wanted, and didn't want, in a few short
concise hotkeys (as opposed to being a hostile dictator), I'd give him
a lot more credit.

Again, it's the default assumption that everybody is that bad that is
really making the whole point of his argument moot. He assumes
everybody else is a newbie and doesn't know what they are doing, while
at the same time expecting everybody to believe and trust he's a god
and always knows what to do.

Then why is he still playing with pickup groups? If he's such a master
player why is he not in and elemntal guild raiding with the same
expirienced people every day?

Ok I agree with you on that one - you should be using the assist key.
The issue I have is that the enchanter is not even willing to consider
the possibility of teamwork on crowd control. If 4+ mobs come running
back to camp and 3 of them go for the casters/healers that say, were
sitting, is it that unreasonable for me to try and root one, possibly
mitigating 1000s of hp damage by the time the enchanter would get to
that one?

Granted that scenario may be a stretch, but again, it's the play style
of basically "the-other-5-members-of-the-group-are-bots-for-the-enchanter"
attitude that just makes me cringe.

I was just taking a cheap shot at the bad writing style of this
paragraph. Yes, I know my writing style is also not always that great.

Not really sure where you take that from. Because I disagree with his
methods you infer that I can't conform or learn?

Maybe. You know this is not a certainty, if it was then half the
people in EQ would play enchanters and there would be no challenge to
the game anymore.

Again, where do you get that from? I have broken very few mezzes on
accident in my time, and most of those when I was first learning about
enchanters. All I'm asking is that you (enchanters in general) let us
know in group tell which mobs you mez.

Really the issue I have with the author again is that attitude of the
all powerful unfallible enchanter. But my disagreement with him/her(?)
can hardly be evidence for my inability to follow such play styles
successfully.

So again the author is basically excusing himself from accidentally
targeting the wrong mob, while telling everybody else that they suck
if they do.

Not at all. he may have been meaning to click on a hot button and
because of the lag clicked somewhere else on the screen. That's
happened to me. Sure you should be using the number keys on your
keyboard, but sometimes it is faster and more convenient to click on a
spell gem or button.

I understand what he's saying and I agree with lots of it (I've
pointed that out as well), but I object strongly with his attitude.

Believe it or not, the same is true for me. Except I guess my message

Well, I really don't know enough about this, so I'll take your word.

I'm not at that high end of the game yet. And neither are 90%+ of
people playing, so the examples you post are the exception, not the
rule. Most of the time what the author described will not be the case.

Hmm. I don't think my reading comprehension is that bad, but I really

As I've already pointed out, I wasn't talking directly to you, but the
author of the post. Therefore, it's quite inconsequential to me what
you think about my judgement regarding this matter.
