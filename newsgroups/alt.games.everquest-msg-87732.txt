I don't know about that mask, but you do get regen as an enchanter in troll 
or iksar form - I frequently use trollform (better regen) to heal up when 
soloing since enchanters don't get heals.

Maybe the mask does give you regen but by the time you can get it/use it 
the regen is pretty insignificant (extra 3hp/tick or something?)
