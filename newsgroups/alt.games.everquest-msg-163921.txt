 And that's a problem how? You still can't play it other than zone
exploring it or wandering around with an emulator. 

 But I'll still agree with the first point. If guildies are buying it
local for the person and sending the code, and the person is looking to
get the software to use with that code, why not just get it from said
guild members since you'd have to get it from somewhere anyway.

 Personally I'd have no problem letting someone use my CDs to install
because it wont do them much good without a code and having to pay their
monthly fee just like everyone else. So in that regard this request does
sound a little fishy.
