That may have happened when he failed the first time ( I wasn't there, 
can't pass judgement ) but it can't be what happened here - unless they 
radically changed the time before he despawns.  We've done the battle 5? 
times when I was present and the force we had this time was more of a DPS 
machine than normal.  Several 51+ Rangers, a 62 ranger, 54 Ice Cometing 
Wiz, 2 Nuking 50+ Druids, a 55 Rogue, 57 Paladin and probably a couple more 
I can't think of.

Waaaaay overkill for this guy and we don't waste time when he pops - we 
just mow him down.  Well, except for me, I play with the 2 adds =)

I bet it =was= an issue with a timer, but a bugged issue since his life 
expectancy after spawning is maybe 30 seconds.
