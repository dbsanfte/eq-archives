Before if you went to Najena for jboots you would find people there 24/7 and
with a long list of people "in line" to get next camp.  And who knew if the
list was real or just some guild hogging the spawn or even selling jboot
looting rights?  I know I was never able to get in there.  Nro is 1000%
better.  No-one is going to make a list there because it's FREE for all.  In
fact lots of times there's not even anyone there camping it.
