I wouldn't care about a 27 hour down time, I played EQ1 for years, and 
long since did the math; paying 1.8 cents per hour is by far the 
cheapest entertainment I've ever purchased, and every now and then 
problems which mean I have to spend a couple days doing something else 
(a couple days, because a big patch usually gets followed by patches for 
the patch, and patches for those patches) just isn't that big a deal.

The WOW behavior sounds more objectionable, not in that they also had 
down time and problems, but that their communication systems are screwy; 
on the other hand, the math ends up the same, a couple days off doing 
something else just isn't that big a deal.

I'm very confused about your mention of what seems to be one of the 
biggest success stories of the internet as "dead wrong".  Yes, I'm one 
of the thousands of anti AOL snobs... but for every "experienced user" 
who refused to have anything to do with a company that wouldn't let us 
control our own front end, they got a dozen people who'd never been on 
the web at all hooked up and running.  For a while, it was the training 
wheels of the web, at this point I think its more the volvo station 
wagon; a little clunky, but you can drive it safely for the rest of your 
life.

Class benefits, well, again, lets say they are down for two days, 
instead of the 27 hours you mentioned.  You are entitled to roughly 87 
cents compensation.  If you want to keep paying 13 bucks a month in 
order to eventually get your 87 cent slice of the pie, I doubt SOE is 
going to be upset.  OH by the way, the lawyers are going to end up 
getting 44 cents of your 87... and that means they go home with a couple 
million bucks in their pockets, so they are the real winners.

Lance

ps well, it was the cheapest form of entertainment... now I'm playing 
Anarchy Online, which is charging $0 for the basic game and $0 a month 
to play for the first year.  If they get two days of down time, I'm 
looking at a whole $0 in compensation, your 43 cent share of the SOE pie 
looks like a fortune!
