If you are gonna do it, do it right.  Your post is a little humorous, but,
once you delete the first three-five x's it becomes appearant.  Instead, I
would recommend making an email account (those free ones out there) with
email forwarding like yahoo provides (or atleast used to), then just have it
automatically forward to any or all of the Verant email accounts.
