Two tactics you can use on Eldrig as a 56 bard: fear kite,
melee/mez/heal.

It won't take you very long using either tactic.  I'd guess 15 minutes
using mez/heal, and probably 10 minutes using fear kiting.  Depending
on your weapons and AA's (if any), of course.

One thing, though, Eldrig is large, and fear song range is short, so
you'll need to be practically in his belly for fear to stick.

Good luck
