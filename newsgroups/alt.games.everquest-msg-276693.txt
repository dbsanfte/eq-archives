This is the tier 2 task right before the Emoush task. My first try on
this did not go well Today. The mobs here seem much harder than the
rest of the DON tasks I've been on. Also, based on the tasks steps
listed at Casters Realm, this looks like it might take a few hours to
get done.

Can anyone tell me about how long it takes to complete all of the
steps? How hard are the named in this task? And lastly, do the mobs
here respawn. We were clearing the courtyard and we did not see repops
after at least 20 minutes, maybe 30. We only have a 69 druid as healer
and we ran her low on mana a few times before we finally had two
deaths. With no rezzer and a few too many close calls we hung up our
swords until we could get a better mix for the task.

Any hints on time needed, force (group) needed, shortcuts and the like
would be greatly appreciated.

Ken
