When playing my druid and grouped with a necro or shadowknight I usually
ask if they want to darkness or me to snare.  Esp if they are a little
higher level than me.  I was with a 50+ necro while on a raid last night
and they said for me to snare, as it was 300 mana for their darkness
line, i said no problem and if got resists, would say so.  Was in Dalnir
so most stuff was blue anyways to my 31 druid, so not too many resists. 
Once the full raid force showed up, stuff didn't live long enough to
bother with snare and I mostly was acting as a wizard, with a few backup
heals.
