Last year someone was kind enough to put the demo of EQ2 from E3 online as
a movie...really really hoping they do that again this year.  

I'm surprised that they are holding to the same "winter 2003" release date
that they initially said.  If a software company hasn't changed their
release date at least once, then my instincts (as a QA Engineer) tell me
they might release an inferior product.
