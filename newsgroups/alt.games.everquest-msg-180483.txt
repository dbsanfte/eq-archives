No, not the dreadful TV show, heh. I would like some ideas of what
would be an ideal group of 5. I have a couple of buddies who are
planning to invade the FV server soon (all of us are dediated RP-ers)
and we're currently working out what is the best way to go in terms of
self-sufficiency. They all have to be different classes. I'm thinking
we need at least a main tank. One to slow. One to debuff, or do crowd
control. Maybe one to track and snare as well. One to pull with feign
death. Maybe one to port/evac.
