You don't "need" to cannidance, but the mount does actually cost you some HP
regen, you are "standing" for HP regen even though you are "sitting" for mana
regen.  Cannidance is better than mounted chain canni because of this.  On
the other hand, the mount means you are also getting mana at meditation rate
while casting other spells (which might not cycle as well with the "sit
during med tics" plan), and best of all, relieves about half the effort
needed to generate mana with canni; now instead of watching for the med tic,
you just spam canni so it casts the instant it comes up and watch your HP bar
and keep an eye on Stoicism/Torpor/Quinessence.  Gee, its soooo easy being a
powershaman, lol, I hadn't really thought about how many things we have to do
all at the same time.  Good thing I played a bard before shaman, so doing 5
things at once was a rest!
