You are assuming I was slurring you.  I don't have to make an 'excuse' on
assumption on YOUR part.

Now who is being childish in their responses.

*shrug*  Of the *3* people responding to the post, 2 people misread it as
an accusation.  Of course, Bizbee, being the more fun posters here didn't
see it as an accusation or found it worth going up and down like a mad dog.
But I keep forgetting, this is Usenet, where people flame other people over
the silliest reasons.

Nope...  When a person goes out of his way to demand an apology for
something that One, was never committed, two, takes a person's post as if
it was going around saying "Oh Look!  Dan Day is scamming the people at
large here!  Watch out, he is lulling you into complete stupidity to rape
you of your money.", then by all earnesty, please, put me on your damn Kill
file so I don't have your nitpicking, egotistical mind go off like a powder
keg over how one can misread, misinterpret and otherwise feel like he is
getting his ass reamed by words.  Since you can't seem to get it into your
head that I stated it was not my intention to slur you, and you felt it
necessary to state the following into your reply:

"So that I can know how to address you more appropriately in
the future, please let me know whether you made this accusation
because you are a) a moron, b) an asshole, or c) all of the above".

Taking into account that your considered my statement as a 'slur' towards
you, obviously, the insult x3 here is calling me either a moron, an asshole
or all of the above...  Never taking in regards it could be just a mistake
in how it is stated, then follow up by saying now that I am not being
honorable or have integrity because I am now making 'excuses' and 'taking
the cowards way to distance' myself from the 'slurring' of your name.  Of
course, even in JEST, I would bet you would take such statements with
enough venom here that you would think I was pissing on your mother or
something instead of it being a statement.

Dan, your idea of 'blunt' is just as much of an undeserved 'slur' you
perceived you have received.  Your reasoning to expect, let alone DEMAND an
apology here has begun to sound like Homer Simpson pitching a fit when he
can't have his way.

Be that as it may...  You seem to be as free to throw around slurs in
public without getting all the facts, demanding 'satisfaction' from people
like Homer Simpson.  Be so kind to add me to your kill file, cause you seem
to be as foolish to believe you can have a double standard of expecting
people not to do things, yet do it yourself and making wild ass
assumptions.
