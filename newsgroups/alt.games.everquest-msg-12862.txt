You got it - there are some situations when our pets will just not behave.  For
instance, if you pet is engaged after assisting the tank, hitting the right mob,
and another mob hits you and is then mezzed, your pet will remember that hit and
go after the mob after the current one falls.  This can cause problems if you
main tank has another target in mind.  I've also seen a mob wake up from mez and
smack my pet because they were right on top of each other, even though you would
expect him to go after the chanter.  Not really sure why that one happened,
maybe the mob was rooted prior?  Anyway, all you can do as the handler is mash
your /pet back off hotkey and look ashamed of your disobediant pet.  This is why
I say enchanters are afraid, well this and those mages who just don't have a
clue about pet handling after 15-20 levels...

Exactly :)
