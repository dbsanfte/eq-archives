Why buy?  Do you prefer to buy stuff rather than kill the stuff that drops
it?

Crown of the Frogluk King, 20 FR/CR.  King in LGuk
Some +7 (I think) FR earrings sell at the gypsy camp in Lavastorm for about
35p each.  I don't know of a similar NPC CR earring dealer near Vox. :(

Some goblins in SolA drop a Fire Gob Totem (so I'm thinking fire gobs drop
'em <g> ).  Classes are restricted here, but I think your bard & ranger at
least can use it.  I think that's 10 FR.

The main idea is to start looking at ALL loot that drops.  Even if it has
pretty crappy stats, take it and add it to your RESIST COLLECTION in the
bank.

I think my enchanter is up to 3 pairs of footwear,  3 cloaks, 3 pairs of
rings and earrings plus at least one replacement for almost every slot on my
body.  I lately hit 194 FR with gear, a FR illusion (one of the skellies)
and a druid buff.  It's not as high as I want to go, but I'm danged proud of
myself considering I started collecting WAY too late in life.
