Yeah, but if Joe's activity doesn't become public, odds are nobody's going
to jump Joe and beat him to a pulp because he "looks" like a sleazy
salesperson.  And odds are he won't be denied housing either.  Many a gay
person has been attacked for "looking" gay (hell, some straights were
attacked for "looking" gay) which to me indicates there is  need for hate
laws.
