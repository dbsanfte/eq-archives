/shrug

Seeing as you've largely invented what you think I am I expect that to 
be pretty easy.

Pretty slick Sherlock. "42" is my age alias. You could have spared 
yourself the trip to google and just asked. I'd have told you that.

I don't post with the same alias, or even via the same isp/ip address, 
news account, or software in several other groups.

Why all this "deception"?

Primarily to prevent asshats from stalking me from group to group, as 
has happened on occasion. And since I frequent groups of both more 
repute and professional relevance than age (which is remarkably civil 
for a video game related group), and groups of notably less, I like 
those boundaries.

Or you can believe I'm lying. Your choice. But I have no need to prove 
anything to you and am disinclined to carry this debate further as 
you've really chosen to argue about nothing; and appear to have posted 
merely to try to belittle me with your l33t skillz at google.

There is little more that needs saying.

Plonk.
