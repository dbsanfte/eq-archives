deathtrap like every other dungeon in the game, and newbies don't need that.

	They have HAD the chance to "show their stuff", and over the last 2.5
years they have shown that they are absolute chimps.  They just put in another
quest (in Stonebrunt) that is totally borked up due to TCC.  

|and experiencing ALL aspects of a new expansion. The truth is,

|that lowbie quest item or lore magic gizmo but truthfully: why
|would you want to? 

	It is not for you to say why I would want to.  People want or don't want
things for their own reasons, and telling people in general and CUSTOMERS in
particular what they "should" want isn't an effective way of dealing with
people.

|If there's a problem with this whole discussion it's that it's focussing

|getting.

	They have already told us that Luclin is not going to offer much to the
endgame crowd.

|Does a 55-60 level character really need to get into a level 20
|and below dungeon? If you really want to experience such a dungeon,
|why not do it the way it was meant to be experienced, with a
|low-level character? 

	Because *I DID THAT ALREADY*, and I DON'T want to look at my spellbook for
another 35 levels.

|As a final thought, I'll lay out the opinion that at least part of
|the reason for the Trivial Loot Code is to try to stimulate the
|economy from the bottom up. 

	Bogus.  One of the big driving points of EQ is that you can achieve your
goals.  If you are willing to put in the work, you can get to any item or any
zone in the game.  The TCC screws that over.

|However, there's one way to find out: Visit Stonebrunt
|Mountains. As surely as the Warrens was an experiment to
|test the viability of the Trivial Loot Code, Stonebrunt is a
|preview of what it will be like to have an entire region
|of zones that have the Trivial Loot Code enabled. Check it
|out and use that experience to gauge how you would feel
|about an expansion with 3/4 of the new zones behaving in
|a similar manner.

	The Warrens was a complete and unmitigated FAILURE.  It doesn't have 10%
of the population a zone of its size should have; much of the time during my
recent visits I was absolutely alone.  In normal business practices when a new
idea craters like this you DON'T use it again, but Verant is marching on;
Stonebrunt has TCC and so will all of Luclin.  This tells us that we're
dealing with ideology, not reason.  TCC exists because Brad McQuaid wants it,
period, full stop, opposing arguments to /dev/null, STFU.

	That ain't good.

|In other words, make an informed decision and then
|vote with your wallet. 

	We have already been informed.  What are we supposed to wait for, an
appointment with the burning bush?
