Thanks for reply, let me add a couple things I might not have specified
properly...

2 times this happened was after zone in, once in PoJ, once in KC, without
having attacked anything.  I also *never* use any form of ae, just group or
targettable songs.  I've also learned to not buff the puller until he/she/it
gets back with pissy mob.  Puller in PoJ each time is 61 monk and I don't
recall him having to fd on anything.  If he's not buffed by me until he gets
back to camp then adds shouldn't be caused by him or myself.  I do have one
question about this buffing adding to aggro though...Even if I *do* manage
to have, say, group haste up, shouldn't the mob be more pissed off at the
druid that has us buffed with every spell she has?  I could be wrong but I
am curious if buffs in general might get mobs as wrinkled as bard buffs.

Sean...
