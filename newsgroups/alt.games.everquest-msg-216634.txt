I've heard two different descriptions on how collection missions are set up.

One, a set number of items are distributed randomly amoung the mobs in the dungeon, so that if you clear every single mob you will
definately win, but you might be able to win sooner if you get lucky and the mobs you kill first happen to be the ones having the items

Two, each mob may or may not have an item, randomly, like with most loot in most of the rest of the game.  Depending on the number of items
you were sent to find, the chance of item per mob varies.  But its possible with bad luck to kill every single mob in the dungeon and still
come up short on items.  Or its possible to be sent for say 23 items and get them in the first 23 mobs.

Either way, it seems to me if you have a group which is capable but finds the dungeon challenging enough that they can't clear it all in
the time limit set, that they are entirely at the mercy of the RNG; will clearing 50% be enough?  70%?  90%?   Impossible to say.

With most missions, it seems that its quite possible to say what will be enough to get the job done, and then leave the remainder of the
dungeon to clear out in the 30 minute "post success" period if the party wants more experience and loot now that the time pressure is off.
But Collection, by its nature, is a crap shoot unless you can always clear 100% within the time limit... and even then its a crap shoot if
the system used for distribution is the second one I mentioned.
