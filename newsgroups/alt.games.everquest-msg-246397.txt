Aw... they always say that.

And.. you think you'll get more money that way? Not likely.

Sounds like you're a character farmer.

So the druid and enchanter have that useless as shit AA Dire Charm. Do
they have the real charm spells? The enchanter have Command of
Druzzil? What of the charm control AA has he gotten?

>If you know anything about this game you know that is a deadly combo

Yes they are.. but only using Command of Druzzil with the druid
birddogging the snare for it, sometimes with the druid having his own
charmed animal. 

>I solo stuff that groups of 6 wipe out on.

Not with a DC pet you don't. Unless we want to talk about groups in
their 30's.. and in your case.. say OS. Anything near your level, in
say BoT would have your DC pet for dinner and ask for seconds.

>It is a dual box dream, there is NO combo that beats dru & enc with dc.

I can name at least one.. a druid and enchanter with charm and no DC.

Well.. being that your characters are basically fixer-uppers and
crippled as is... they'll need work to get them into two-boxing shape
for anything you would want to kill with them... basically BoT rares.
As such, you're not likely to get top dollar. Get them both a couple
hundred more AA, with the chanter getting all of his charm control AA
and them both full defensive and what not... and you might make some
decent change.

But.. what it really sounds like to me is you are a character farmer
pumping out 65's/100AA and you want to bring them to market.
