Start your Burning Rapier quest.  Solo, group, and roguish skills
all rolled into one.  A 7/20 piercer with stats and a fire proc aren't
bad, either.  A 7/20 piercer, while not "uber," will chew through most
old world content like butter...content designed for a 6/23 piercer
being standard.

Burning Rapier is a _fun_ quest, too.  All except for Blackburrow.
But it sounds like what you're looking for all in one neat package.
