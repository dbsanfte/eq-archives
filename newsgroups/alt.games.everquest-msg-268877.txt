Yes, it stops that too.  The good goes out with the bad.
But, at least to some, playing a druid and not having
*anyone* ask for SoW or "Heal Plz!" or "Buffs Plz!"
or "PL me Plz!" means it's worth it.  It's still possible
to heal people after fights -- so they aren't sitting ducks
for the next aggro mob to wander through -- or watch
a fight and heal the tank just after they /yell and start
to run, etc.   But you don't hear ANY "xx for Donations"
or any "Donating for xx" and the like.

It's still possible to be *nice* -- but all the crap that came
with the unlimited ability to buff other players disappeared
and, IMO, that was more than worth it.
