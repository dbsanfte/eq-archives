My apologies, but I must take exception to the above.  Druids are
great.  Our group tactics call for the clerics present to chain heal our
main assist, while secondary healers (shammies & druids) do pick up
heals on the remainder of our melees.  Generally works like a charm. 
The main assist goes in, runed, and slugs it out with the mob until such
time as he has a major amount of aggro.  Then the rest of the melees are
called in, and when the mob is slightly under half health, the nukers
get called in.  Our secondary healers are the primary reason that we can
get away clean with NO deaths on some pretty major mobs.  And end game
druid buffs rule.  I think we've taken down Trak three times with only
two or three deaths, usually by someone who gets a little overanxious
and starts nuking too soon, and busts agg.  End game tactics utilize
just about every class, and it takes a good deal of pre-planning and
coordination, especially when you're going in with 40 plus people.
