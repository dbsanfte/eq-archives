Still even goofing up pretty badly with molten metal isn't -likely- to 
kill you outright. (At least not from daydreaming or using the wrong 
ingredients)

Theres a Warhammer 40k game called necramunda involving squad combat 
between rival gangs. During a battle characters who's hits are reduced 
to 0, are 'down'. They are removed from play, and are out of the battle. 
But they aren't 'dead'. At the end of the battle you roll a dice and 
more than likely most will recover fully for use in the next battle, 
some might have reduced stats, and the odd one will actually die from 
his injury.

That's much how 'death' in EQ2 really works, even if that's not whats 
its called. (except in EQ there isn't even the chance for actual 
permadeath)

You are just 'injured and down for a while', not 'dead'.
