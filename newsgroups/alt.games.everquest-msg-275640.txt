There are two reasons that I can think of:

He may be the wrong guy - there are four per zone (I think) and only
one of them will let you in so try all of them that you can  find in
the Temple Street.  The others in the zone are only available when you
get to 10th level and choose your profession and then only one of the
others will become available.

You may have, inadvertantly, already joined one.  It's only a short
conversation and you could have joined thinking that you were starting
a quest.  Bring up the societies window - it should be easy to see if
you are a member of one of them.  Just select it and leave the society
- there is a button to do that.
