EQ will begin to die as soon as the subscribers believe there
will be no more expansions.  If SOE wants to keep milking this
cash cow they need to announce a planned expansion fairly soon.
I hope they do.  There's a guild waiting for me in EQ2, but I
can't afford the hardware upgrade atm, and besides I've got 10
months or so left on my EQ subscription anda number of things
I still want to do in game.

The player population has taken a visible hit on the server I
play on, but not a huge one.  It reminds me a lot of the DAoC
release (which followed the debacle known as Luclin, quite an
amusing parallel to the more recent Dx9 + GoD mess).  I think
there's a fair bit of life left in EQ, but it is well within
SOE's power to kill it fairly quickly via neglect.
