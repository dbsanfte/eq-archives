I heard a story about some teenage kid who was waiting to leave a
baseball game. He got tired of waiting for the crowds to get out of
his way, so he got the bright idea that he could leave the stadium
faster if he just jumped down from the upper deck to the lower deck. A
drop of some 40-50 feet. He figured he wouldn't be hurt because he had
seen people do jumps like that on TV.

I think he got lucky and only shattered his spine. Hopefully that
impaired his ability to breed.
