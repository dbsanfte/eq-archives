More power to you. If you really enjoy it, you might want to consider
offering your services for a percentage of the take - there are people
(like me!) who find the sales gig exhausting and will go to great
lengths to avoid it. Someone like you who enjoys it might well be able
to pull a win for both parties.

Aside... I know a guy who also enjoys the sales gig, and is very good
at it. He's never traded down. I'm reasonably sure he could start with
a rusty dagger and, given a bit of time, make enough trades up to turn
it into a Kedge Totem :)
