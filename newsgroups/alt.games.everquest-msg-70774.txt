Ah to get back to the subject of the thread like this post:

Vah shir get racial safe fall, probably of about 50.
They get racial sneak, probably of about 50. It works very well
for my shaman (only race of shaman which gets sneak.. HAR HAR) for
selling or buying from vendors who diss it otherwise.

They get infravison, no, not ultravision but only infra. I can tell
the difference because I have a wood elf druid(infra)  in wolf form
(ultra) and a dark elf cleric (ultra) Ultra for me always has a bright
bluish hue to the vision while the way the vah shir sees is exactly
the same as my wood elf when not in wolf form (so infra)

Vah shir also get pretty much the exact same faction as barbarians of
their same class, only without a minus for having a god (tribunal) In
fact it seems like the barb shaman faction was copied over when my vah
shir was amiable to the barb shaman guild, indiff to everyone else and
glower duboius to some druid factions in surefall glade. These are the
EXACT factions a starting barb shaman of the tribunal has in halas.

The bonus is that some other factions such as the East freep sewer are
higher I guess since godless. My shaman kitty vah shir was
apprehensive to xelha and the dismal rage people and indiff actually
to opal darkbriar (evil one) and only glower dubious with the dark elf
cleric of innoruuk down there. After checking that con I went to
nektulous but she is indeed scowl with dark elf guards = /

For my money vah shir makes a great shaman due to having safe fall and
sneak. The safe fall is probably going to be of the most use in areas
like stonebrunt where my chars seem to take constant damage just
runing along and falling like the equivilent of 2 inches in real life.
The sneak is going to have a very good benefit with various vendors
and quests (plus once level 9 can sneak with sow on for decreased
aggro in possibly dangerous places)

It might not be as easy a shaman as a troll or an iksar (regen for
even more cannabalise) but it is sure to be fun.
