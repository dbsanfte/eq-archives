I can't find any boots exactly like you describe, but a
pretty close match is Wolf Fur Slippers, although they have
Mana+20 (not +25) and come from Permafrost, which isn't in Velious.
They do have an AGI+7 boost, and AC 2, and sell for around 5-600+pp,
so a "fire sale" price of 300p sounds reasonable.
