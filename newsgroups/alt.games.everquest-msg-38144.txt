I'm betting the journalist was confused.  There's no way a wholly new gigantic
project called EQ 2 is going to be released next year.

Maybe it was Luclin stuff, or an unannounced expansion.  *shrug*  But not EQ 2
(or if it *was* EQ 2, it's sure as hell not coming out next year).

Still, the fact that their security was so compromised bugs the *hell* out of
me.  It didn't mention credit card numbers in the article, but if they had
names and addresses... uh, damn.  And if station names/passwords were in
there, Verant best be changing their "You're hacked?  Your fault!" policy
ASAP.

I know most companies would fire your ass if you had work files on a home PC
that then had its security compromised.  Nice going McQuaid, this is going to
be a PR nightmare, and for once, I think it *should* be.

Idiots.  Pure and simple.  They deserve all the shit they catch for this.  And
I am a long time defender of their policies and practices (for the most part).
Sigh.
