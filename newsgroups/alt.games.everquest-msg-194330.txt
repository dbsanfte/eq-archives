Bite the bullet and skill up in baking to 191.  Make patty melts.  I have no
problem selling for 20pp a stack in the bazaar.  Of course, cheese is only
available in Jaggedpine, so fill up when you go there.  (cost to make a
stack is about 3pp).

With skills of 163 in Pottery and 151 in Brewing (both with the geerlocks,
also), I get a 12 to 15% fail rate on the Prismatic Dyes as it's a 3-step
combine (fire the vial, brew the dye, bottle it).  At ~29pp a failure, it's
not cheap and theres always somone selling at 40-45pp, so profit is not
great.

Other than that, padding and silk threads sell real well.
