No, but you did say, "The puller should always be the toughest tank in
the group," with which I disagree.

I suppose that might be true if you are interested first and foremost in
always keeping things as safe as possible. Like I said, however, IMO that
pretty much reduces it to boring button mashing. 

I'd much rather push the envelope a bit, thereby improving my own tactics 
and abilities while keeping it interesting.

To each their own, I suppose.
