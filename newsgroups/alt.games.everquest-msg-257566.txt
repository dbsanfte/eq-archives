Well, I'll agree with you on the most part there.  I have seen rangers with
a lot of AAs do a fine job of tanking in later PoP.  Of course, it's a
difficult path to get elementally geared. :)

Well, PoP has regulated rogues to a second rate class as well, as rogue
skills have been rendered their skills to unnecessary.  So DPS is all rogues
have as well.  LDoN has proven disappointing with no more than 3 traps to be
sensed and disarmed per adventure, most of which can either be avoided or
are not painful.

About the only enjoyment out of the game that I've been getting as of late
is the rare /tell from enchanters, rangers, and shammies to get a door open
in CoM.

I still don't understand the reservation of having to melee like other
classes.
