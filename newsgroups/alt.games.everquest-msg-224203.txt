I don't honestly know what we have in the way of AE heals, it has not 
been an issue in the encounters that we have.

As far as AAs go, it varies anywhere from under 10 AAs to over 200.  
Average is probably 40ish at a wild guess.

Our plan was to save the MGBs for rebuffing after the dispell.

Strategy for TT sounds like exactly what we had planned.  Our biggest 
concern is just having enough people there to actually take on TT.
