    Several minis in Fire and Water had their difficulty increased.
Elemental gods are now on a strict timer in that they don't re-pop with
patches or server outages. The rings in Earth A were initially enhanced to
drop two loots per clear versus one, but they are currently bugged and you
can only get loot from them from the first kill after a patch. Some of the
rings in Air are the same way. The toughest ring in Air was made
significantly easier by the pathing changes patch. Fennin and Xegony were
beefed up, but Xegony was made easier by the pathing patch and Fennin is
currently bugged and easier than most of the other mobs in Fire. Warlord G
in Earth B was made harder, the Rathe Council encounter was made
significantly more difficult then reduced in difficulty to what it is now.
Drop frequencies of the non-mold loot haven't changed since the zones first
came out. Players just hate getting the common-drop molds versus the
uncommon-drop alternative loots, as molds drop in several different places
and thus are much more common. Arbitor in Earth was made easier. The ability
to bind in the elemental planes was removed. The entry requirements to Earth
B were made more difficult. The "slows hasting bosses" feature was removed
from the elemental gods.

    I think that pretty much sums up all the changes to the elemental planes
since players first entered them. I leave it up to the reader to decide if
these zones had been playtested and tuned adequately.

    Yes, because initially she was a complete pushover.

    That changes, at least initially, when you get to the elemental planes.
The loot there beats VT loot with ease. Apparently they're re-tuning the
lower tier drops to be more rewarding. We'll see if that helps. Ideally,
when PoP came out guilds should have had to be in VT gear to beat the Tier I
bosses and the Tier II bosses. As it was, guilds without any VT gear were
able to get all the way to Tier III within a few weeks of release (BoT, HoH
on my server). That messed up the idea of "progression" big time.

    ToSR will keep you busy one day out of every three (five trials,
eventually Solusek Ro). BoT plus HoH should be able to keep you busy one day
out of every three (two loot dropping trials in HoH, Mith Marr, Agnarr, the
BoT minis if the loot problem is fixed). Tactics should be able to keep you
busy the final day of the three day cycle, especially as you learn RZ (VZ,
TZ, Glykus, the two mini nameds on the way to VZ/TZ, the RZ script). As long
as others aren't killing stuff on you, Tier III should keep you quite
occupied and swimming in VT quality loot.
