If the mobs were not soloable, then they could drop valuable loot
commonly. 

Not _good_ loot, valuable loot. Put a 12/15 30 AC sword with 50% haste
on a fast spawning soloable mob and it would sell for 500pp within a
week or so, and probably bottom out at 100pp.

Without valuable loot, there are no raids. Raids are, for some people,
fun. Fun, well, if I need to explain why fun is good, then I guess I am
talking to the wrong person.

You will hear a lot of complaint from high level characters who like
raiding, but end up playing a class that is not to their tastes in the
raid game. But they don't want to restart, because they will have to get
through at least 45 levels of sitting and exping before they can join
the lowest level raids. So they stick to their existing class, and whine
asking for the class balance to tweaked for the 400th time, as if that
had something to do their problem.
