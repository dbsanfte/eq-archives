Yes there is, it is horribly slow. Low speed = lots of damage bonus.

Ye gods...I would simply not allow a 57 warrior with a wurmslayer in my
group. Not elitism, but I would just rather not group with anyone that
amazingly stupid.

A lamentation is trivial to get at 57, on my server (which isn't terribly
old) the price on them has dropped to 6k and lower. It out-damages the wurm
by a good 30%.
