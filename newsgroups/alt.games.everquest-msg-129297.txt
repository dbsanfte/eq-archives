MMORP = "Massively MULTI-PLAYER..."

Doubt heads will be "pulled out" of anything, since the game was not
inteded to be solo friendly, and in fact, most design elements seem to
indicate that they have gone out of their way to limit it. Not saying it
doesn't still happen, particularly with necros, druids, and wizards, but
even then the high end content will never be available to soloists.
Probaly the "bait" they put in to tempt them to come out and group up.
