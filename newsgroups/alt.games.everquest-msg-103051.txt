    Quite low. It might very well be a "can't miss" combine, like spider
silks, but people who aren't rogues have reported failing it. (Yes, you can
attempt it even if you aren't a rogue. I think the last reports I saw at
EQTraders had non-rogues running a one third to 50% success rate on it.)

    Each ingredient is about 1 pp.
