Val,
    LoIO is a great place to be for a long, long time.  Better than South
Karana ever was (IMHO).  Think carefully about leaving there for such a far
away place.

    That said, CC is a cool place to be.  It has a town with a bank in it
(although, you may have to do some work before you can sell at the vendors
there), tons and tons of mobs that yield good exp, plenty of loot that is
still on the "hotlist" of stuff to sell (as a 30 druid, you taking jaunts
back to EC to auction for the 2 of you can make you both quite wealthy if
you work at being a p.c. merchant) and there is the occasional "brass ring"
to aim for whenever the 2 of you meet some other friends to go take down the
queen.
    Now the downsides: The way IS treacherous.  Keep invis up.  The entrance
is in the very middle of a tough zone, within a fort full of high-level,
invis-seeing, constantly-sowed orcs that hit as hard as some planar mobs
that I have encountered.  The best place for you to bind (IMHO) is at the
orb within the fort that takes you into the caverns (not your friend, of
course, he'll bind in Thurg.)  That in itself is really rough because if you
die/zone you have to constantly watch for someone training that orb.  Sit
behind it with your mouse pointer steady at the orb to click your way back
in.  Wait a few, and then zone back in to med/heal within the caverns.  The
fort surrounding the entrance is more dangerous than the caverns themselves.

    Trains are real bad in CC and the place is a maze.  Fight at the
zoneline for a lion's share of time to learn it.  Then move to the dwarven
fort and hunt that side to learn there.  (There's a shortcut down that you,
as a levitating/invising Druid can take you two to.)  Then learn the other
side of the dwarves.  Then (with experienced group nearby) find the zones
beyond the other side of the dwarves.  Last, (and only when you get a good,
full group) chart the maze.  Once you are the masters of it, you'll be one
of the happiest people around.

    If you're willing to take the time to do the set up, print this, and
other's instructions and fight conservatively, you can both make out like
bandits.

Good luck,

-"Grim"
