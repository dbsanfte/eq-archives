From my point of view, I'm hacing a pretty good time, even though I'm
mostly soloing or in duo's.  I'm fairly time limited myself, but have
made it to the mid-teens in a week of play, and have probably spent
4-5hours tradeskilling during that time too.

The quest system isn't quite as user friendly as WoW, but there is a
lot of it, and I ended up getting to the max # (50) pretty quick.  YOu
really need to be picky about some of what you take.  Some can be a
challenge however, especially when it comes to finiding a certain
person to speak too.

The tradeskilling is a mini-game in its own right, and I sometimes log
on for and just do that if  don't have a lot of time to spend.

Looks good, except the video card.  I'm using a ATI9600 and it looks
fine, so you shouldn't have to break the bank.  I think those are
sub$100 cards now.  Of course, you can always spend more if you want.
