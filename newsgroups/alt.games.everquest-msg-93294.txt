Furthermore, nobody owes you to fix your fuck-ups.

I would *never* expect a rez for free and don't understand why anyone else
would. It doesn't matter how much mana it takes, how much time it takes for
the rezzer to recoup their mana, if it is only mana, if it is only a game,
if the rezzer is using their mana at the time or not, etc. The bottom line
is THEY ARE DOING YOU A FAVOR. Show some appreciation.

...

If I am not using my mana, you don't say "plz" or "u", you actually ASK for
[buff/heal] instead of demanding it "[Buff/heal] please" is a demand in my
book. The please looks more like an afterthought than it does genuine.), I
am more than happy to buff/heal.

If someone is in immediate danger and didn't train to some place stupid
(like the dock in Oasis or the mill in LoIO), I'll heal them/buff them/whack
the mob irregardless if I am using my mana or not.

If I am using my mana and you are not in immediate danger, I expect
something in return.

...

The other day, my anon druid was minding its own business, medding in the
mill in LoIO.

A player comes up to me asking for a SoW.

Me: "What's in it for me?"

A_Beggar: "The satisfaction of helping another player as I'm sure someone
has helped you."

(If someone helped me, I owe THEM, not you.)

Me: "I don't expect [I didn't empasize it but I should have emphasized
expect] people to help me [without something in return]. I offer them
something in return. Then it is a trade. There ain't no such thing as a free
lunch."

A_Beggar: "What about [A_Beggar's other character] who breezed you the other
day."

(I should help you in the name of helping you while you help people
expecting help, the exact same thing I expect.)

Me: "And didn't I SoW [A_Beggar's other character]?"

(A_Beggar breezed me and my partner right after stealing our kill so I
thought A_Beggar did so as an apology. I thought I SoWed A_Beggar as if to
say "No worries.".)

Them: [The typical reposnse of I've made a note of your name. See if I help
you ever again.]

(As if. (We are the only two people playing the game.))

Few days pass.

A_Beggar shouts "Breezing at mill for donations."

I send a tell. "Oh, so you expect a free lunch but aren't willing to give
one? *shock*"

Part of it was my own fault, thinking I could med in the mill without being
bothered. So now I med atop the walls.
