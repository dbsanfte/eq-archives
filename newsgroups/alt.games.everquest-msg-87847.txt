I know my friend have had this following from time to time, but I have NEVER
encountered it... untill today, AFTER THE PATCH, may I add..

Anyway, what happens is than after logging in, and playing for a few
minutes, I CRASH right back to my Windows desktop. No sight of EQ. Not in my
taskbar, not ANYWHERE?! It's been 5 (FIVE) times so far today, and now I'm
just giving up. Died 2 times because of it.
Last attempt was new record : was on for less than 1 minute before crashing.

So, has anyone ever tried this? Any suggestions?
And again : I have NEVER had this problem, untill after yesterdays patch...

Morten
