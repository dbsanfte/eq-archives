"Grief:
This factor measures the desire to objectify and use other players for 
one's own gains. Their means may be both outward or subtle. On the 
outward side, they may enjoy dominating other players by killing them on 
the battlefield, or by taunting and annoying them. On the more subtle 
side, they may enjoy manipulating other players for their own gains, 
such as deceiving other players through clever scams, or begging for 
money and items."

I scored a 55 here. And I couldn't care less about manipulating other 
players, deceiving them, scamming them, begging from them.

The only area I was even slightly positive was related to getting 
revenge. And I'm not even 'vengeful', but I do make a point of 'not 
helping' someone whos gone out of their way to KS and train me.

I was pretty neutral on most of the questions. The relative amounts on 
the rest of the stuff is bang on... achievement being more important 
then immersion / group affiliation and those being more important then 
relationships. But greif at 55% is just way off, and should be below 
relationships, imho.

1. 4 (pretty neutral)
2. 6 (immersion is good)
3. 1 (i don't 'taunt')
4. 2 (optimize xp... i prefer to explore and to challenge... but I try 
to ensure I'm always moving forward)
5. 4 (pretty neutral. I like grouping... i don't have to have it)
6. 1 (not applicable)
7. 3 (i play my character when i bump into an rper, but its not a big 
deal to me)
8. 1 (i don't like to 'dominate' other players)
9. 6 (i prefer not feeling like useless deadweight :)
10. 6 (i prefer being guilded, but am not at the moment, and am not 
concerned by that)
11. 2 (i play mostly with people I already know)
12. 5 (i'd like to feel like part of a story, but thats not an eq strong 
point)
13. 2 (not beyond suggesting places to hunt with relevant drops for me)
14. 5 (i like improving my gear, i don't go nuts about 'best gear 
available')
15. 6 (im loyal, but not rabidly so)
16. 1 (im playing a game not looking for help)
17. 4 (i don't really get 'in character', but I don't talk about the 
hockey game either...)
18, 1 (never)
19. 6 (sure I want to accomplish my game goals, but I'm not stressed 
over it)
20. 6 (i respect good ones, but there is no shortage of putzes)
21. 1 (not applicable, unless munchies is an RL crisis)
22. 2 (not my thing, but I don't think its a bad idea)
23. 6 (i make a point of not helping the asses in the future, that's 
about the extent of my revenge.)
24. 1 (its not my top priority... moving forward is important to me, but 
the speed at which im moving is a non-issue)
25. 3 (I enjoy being part of something 'bigger' like a raid but I have 
the most fun when I don't feel like a cog in the wheel.
