For those of you who don't know, this looks like a GREAT quest for a +10 wis
+10 mana testament of vanear.  I have read on allakhazam's that you can just
give Moodoro Finharn 2 gold and he'll give you a two slot container testament
of vanear that you put the to missing pages (30 and 34) in and get the real
testament.  This sounds a lot easier.  Will this work?  Thanks very much in
advance!
