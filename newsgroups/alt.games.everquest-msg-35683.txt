I'm terribly, dreadfully sorry Bizbee that I made such a horrible, glaring
error.  What your feeble mind fails to grasp is that I wasn't attempting to
be any sort of Usenet authority, unlike Stan Mann.

This whole 'usenet elitism' is amusing to the point of absurdity.

"OMG, he called it a board!"
"hehe"
"what a loser"
"newb"
"lets flame him"
"get him girls"
"lol"

I can only hope I can find the strength to carry on.
