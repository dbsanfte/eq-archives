that's why we get sentinel...(/cry indeed)

i seem to remember them getting rid of the spellbook as a patch, not
as part of an expansion - could be wrong ... it feels related to the
fact that the velious interface (which was awesome!) was hindered by
the spellbook view forcing your resolution to change, something like
that... it's kind of fuzzy in the ol' memory

escaping sony shutting it down)
