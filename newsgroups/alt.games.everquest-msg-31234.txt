If you want to be the cornerstone of a group at later levels, play an
enchanter. Along with the other heros of grouping, the cleric and
arguably the warrior, you form the core of a truly great group.

Some skill is required to play an enchanter susscessfully.If you go
down this track find a twink who plays an enchanter and grill him
good.

Enchnaters almost never lack for a group after the initial horror of
getting to 16 (when they get breeze). After that its a group cakewalk,
enchanters are snapped up in seconds on my server.

And yes, they CAN solo, but you might need to work on charisma gear a
little for this to work effectively.
