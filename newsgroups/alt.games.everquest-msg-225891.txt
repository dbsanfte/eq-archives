You gotta love a game with this much subtlety and a newsgroup with this much
maturity and understanding of the game.

You're saying that increasing the risk to more fragile players enriches the
game because of the requirement it introduces that all players must play
more carefully or else suffer the consequences. So you favor compromising
the ability of the Warrior to control aggro in order to create the tension
that comes from other players having to carefully manage their aggro.  A lot
of wiped out parties might disagree, but I have to agree it's pretty
thematic for a game that enforces so much player interdependence. This is,
ultimately, one of the primary strengths of the game. Very good point.
