  Then I guess it should be easy for Verant to anticipate these
changes and give their customers some prior notification.

  I personally still find it unacceptable that, even without upgrading
to Luclin, to enjoy the same level of gameplay as I was prior to the
patch, that I'd essentially have to do in excess of $200 worth of
upgrades to my system, with little or no warning from Verant that this
would be the case.  $90 for Windows 98 (or XP), $70 on a new graphics
card (some of my favorite dungeons and towns I can barely walk through
due to now terrible frame rates... before the patch, performance was
good/playable) and $20 on memory.

  I don't think that people should have to expect to do upgrades that
cost 5 to 10 times more than the software itself unless they are
actively choosing to upgrade the software that they should expect has
more demanding requirements (e.g. Luclin).  And if such system
upgrades are necessary, I think we deserve at least 2 weeks to a month
warning in advance.

  I personally never expected this magnitude of upgrades would be
necessary to continue decent gameplay.  Maybe I'm stupid, ignorant, or
whatever... but there are a hell of a lot of people out there who are
a lot more stupid/ignorant than me about computers and technology.  To
me, this is as much a customer service issue as it is a technology
issue, though.  Verant, if they want to please their customers, has a
responsibility to INFORM their customers when something like this is
about to happen and then deal with it gracefully when it does.  So
far, in my opinion, they have roundly failed to do so.
