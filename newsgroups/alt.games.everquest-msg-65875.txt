Hopefully this is my last update in this thread. The proposed solution
which was arrived at with the help of all of you, worked like a champ.
Throughout this long, painful, and at times expensive process of
upgrading my machines to be Luclin compatible, this group has been an
unending source of information, support, inspiration, and most of all,
patience with my unending stupid questions, guiding me through the
process. I'm very grateful to all of you, and I just wanted to say
thanks.
  The nVidia GF2 MX 400 is now safely in my top PCI slot (thanks again
for the tip to try the top slot first and save myself some time) the
drivers are installed, the machine is running like an Olympic sprinter,
and the "New EQ", with SoL installed, textures on high and most of the
character models turned on, is running as well, if not better, than the
old configuration ever did with the pre-SoL EQ.
  So, for those still struggling with hardware upgrades and questions,
dont' give up! And listen to the nice people in this group. They know
what the fuck they're talking about. And if you can't decide what system
configuration your'e shooting for, I don't know what the exact *minimum*
is to run SoL at full bore, but I can tell you that the following works
like magic for me:

P3-600
512 MB RDRAM
nVidia GF2 MX 400 video card (64 MB RAM)
Windows 98 SE
DirectX 8.1

Hrmmm....... sounds suspicously like the exact specs VI called for as
the "reccomended".
