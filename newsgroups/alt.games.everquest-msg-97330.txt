Actually, I find that a more encouraging sign than I would have
if they had done only one or two "oh wow" changes per patch for
several weeks running.

If they dribbled them in, I'd be thinking, "where will this stop??"

But the way they're all being dumped on us at once, it gives
me the impression they've had long meetings over a long
time period, asked what *all* do we think needs tweaked (and
how do the changes interact with each other), and
then just did them all together.

I'd be surprised if there were as many more "game altering" changes
after this big batch.

They've taken a lot of long-standing issues (and problems)
concerning the mechanics of the game and knocked them off
the list all at once.  How many more can there be, really?
