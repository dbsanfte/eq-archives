Terrorists who were shielded by, given acquiescence to, sheltered by,
*funded* by, that government.  They were practically an official arm of
the government.  Stop dreaming.

Because you know that if you did pay attention to actual, real, numbers
and simple facts your emotional arguments deflate like a week old party
balloon.  Can't let logic stand in your way, now can you?

Don't be ridiculous.  As "callous" as it sounds, the costs were *NOT*
"equally as high."  And as much as you want to "just one child" it, that
won't change.  If the "costs [were] equally as high" we'd have gone
after B.L. after one of his earlier attacks on us.  9-11 wasn't the
*first* time he'd killed Americans.  But the "costs" were *MUCH*
higher.  He knew that or he wouldn't have done it.  If the "costs [were]
equally as high" B.L. would have kept killing Americans a half-dozen at
a time instead of flying planes into buildings.  So, in other words,
both the Terrorist and the Target says that you're full of crap.  The
"costs" are *FAR* different.
