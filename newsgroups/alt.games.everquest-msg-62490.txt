I have experienced this twice... once after 29 and once after 31 (Dinging)
I came back in and it seemed to be fine.  kind of annoying though.... Maybe
we should all report it after we get it...(Like at the same time making a
huge issue out of it.) So that it is a known issue later on....  None the
less how many of us have reported it?
