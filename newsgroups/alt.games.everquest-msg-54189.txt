Not to be too harsh, but that's a load of crap. Haste for warriors is
*always* a good thing. Yes, your primary function is to take the
beating, but faster hitting equals more taunt, so that's a plus right
there. Also, there won't *always* be a chanter or shammy or bard around
to haste you. Much better to be self sufficient in that area. And the
"macho" thing is total bullshit. Even given the fact that your primary
job is to take damage, the more damage you can dish out to help the real
damage dealers in the group, the faster the mobs go down the and the xp
bars go up. As to your cleric comment, "it also gets you smacked around
more so the Cleric has to end up healing you." I don't even know what to
say to that. In an ideal situation, you'll be the *only* person the
cleric is healing. Getting the mobs even more angry at you isn't going
to increase the amount of damage you take of the mana spent to heal you.
Haste is never a waste. (Hey! I'm a poet!)
