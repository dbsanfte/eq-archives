I did not use the root and nuke/dot tactic, just kited them around the fort
area.  I kept away from others, sometimes got an add, but was usually able
to kill the original one by just continuing to run far enough to avoid the
add, and nuke the original to death.  I did have to zone at times.  This was
at level 29/30 with my Shaman.  At 27/28 I didn't have any luck killing one
if I had an add.  I did always choose blue giants.
