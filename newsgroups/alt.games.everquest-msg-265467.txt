Lance my friend, most people are Christians here in the USA. Most people 
don't have a problem with voting at a Church. John Kerry has been in a Black 
Christian church 4 weeks in a row trying to get their votes. I am white and 
at my church a few years ago we had voter registration cards on had and the 
ACLU came after us. We no longer have the cards on hand.  Christian Churches 
are used for a lot of things to help the people. When we have  Earthquakes 
or high water or what ever kind of disaster they are there shelter to help. 
Just my 2 cents worth ). I got to get back to work, take care.
