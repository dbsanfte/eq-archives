This also happens as a result of using autofollow.  In AF, you will cycle run/walk
back and forth in order to keep up with the person you are following (who may
pause or just be running slower than you are) and when you break AF, you end up in
whatever state you were in at that point.  This can easily be walk instead of run,
and its very easy to miss this, since you know for a fact that you never turned
walk on.

My bard died due to this just the other day, got to Siren's Grottoe on Selos, took
that off and put TBoots on, zoned in and started across.  Couldn't seem to lose
the mobs at all, like I didn't have Tboots on at all.  I got all the way to the WW
line and died just shy of the line.  As I stared at the load please wait screen
wondering how I'd failed such a simple run which I'd made half a dozen times, and
my cleric a hundred times easily, I realized Walk was on... last time I'd followed
someone was at least a half hour earlier, but with Selos, walking just isn't all
that slow, I'd never noticed!
