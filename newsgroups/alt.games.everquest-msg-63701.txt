FYI I ran EQ with DX8 in the ini file and all looked good to start
with. However after running from one side of OT to the other the frame
rate dropped badly and spell effects were surrounded by black boxes.
Then windows on the screen started greying out for a few seconds at a
time. When I reached Rottgrimme in the outpost he seemed to have
learned how to levitate.

New Matrox drivers and turning off TnL didn't solve the problem. Only
switching back to DX7.

As I live in UK I won't see my shiny new copy of Luclin until around
the 10th anyway. I am just hoping the "old world" continues to run
until I get a new card.

BTW what card are you buying?

I am scared too :o/
