Fire pet...usless?  Played one mage up thru 60..quit..came back to
game and now have a 59th mage again.  Which pet did I solo with
wickedly fast both times..you got it..fire pet....only this time it
was much easier since I can now give my pets summoned armor and can
heal it.  Before pet heals I simply chain casted fire pets.  Learn the
skill...it's invaluable.

Plus I couldn't bear hitting a level and not having all 4 of my
pets...while I didn't use them all sometime...as a mage I felt I just
had to have them.

Rain spells..not real great at lower levels, but I use Scirocco
extensivley once I got it....debuff mob..toss on a few
Sciroccos...watch the hit points of the mob fall...still I used even
the lower level ones efficiently

Either a) pay attention to battle spam to see when mobs aren't getting
hit by a DS....or b) add a timer to your UI.

Rare occassions?  Once I got ring I was almost always lev'd in groups.
Amazing how much easier it is to land bolts while lev'd.  Also....ever
run from a mob?  It runs a path down a hill while you continue to go
straight...letting you put more distance between you and said
mob...again...rare occassions?  Since I had to give up my peggy cloak
to get epic, I'm back to making a few of these rings everytime I log
in at night.  I really should go back to SK to get me another.

Dagger of Symbols was good for the time it was created...back before
pets took the resists of thier masters if they were greater than their
own innate resists.  Like alot of things in EQ, their value has
deminished as the game has progressed.

Phantom Plate makes a big difference when pet is wearing it.  Wait til
mobs really start to hit hard and you'll see it.  If you aren't giving
plate to pets and still using chain you are cheating yourself.

Never cared for expell summoned line of spells.  Less mana efficient
than normal spells, as you said.  Was like this 4 years ago..still the
same today.

Another spell that was FANTASTIC for when it was made.  Since changes
to pet aggro...not so useful...but I still use it daily on one of the
farm camps I do. :D
