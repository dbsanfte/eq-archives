My Necro has mostly given up on causing damage to mobs in dungeons, 
other than using the pet, and instead makes sure the the cleric and 
enchanter are always moving with more mana, that he pre-mezzes stuff 
which aggro's the enchanter, slows if the chanter gets a couple of 
resists or if there are lots of adds, etc.

Mobs are lasting 40-60 seconds, and the mana cost of even the nukes 
doesn't make it worth causing damage.  If my necro runs out of mana, no 
real big deal, but if the enchanter or cleric do, it's downtime we don't 
need.  So he dedicates himself to keeping the group moving.
