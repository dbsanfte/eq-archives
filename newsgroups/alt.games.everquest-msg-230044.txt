I think 1 to 5 is too easy but 6 to 10 is reasonable enough.

What is a "newbie" city?  Are there "non-newbie" cities?

Perhaps SOE could have solved that problem another way.  Maybe there is
something SOE could have put in the cities to make them a more desirable
place to be.  The cities can be an awful lonely place.  Which is weird!

That being said I like the soulbinders and would not remove them.

Ouch.  :(

I always wondered if this would work: Perhaps equipment you can buy/sell
(trade) should slowly but surely decay and stuff that is NO DROP should
not decay.  I wonder how well that would solve the "mudflation" problem.

Well said.
