Has nothing to do with being lazy.  It requires no effort to press
auto-run and wait for West Karana to go by.  It requires no effort
to sit around and wait 20 minutes for a boat to show at the EFP
docks, and then wait another 20 minutes for it to arrive in BBM.
It is, however, boring as hell after the first time or two and
therefore decidedly not fun.

No. What he said.

If that's so then they missed the mark by a country mile.

Yes, and reward the tiny fraction of enthusiastic tradeskillers
(along with the much more numerous tradeskill mules) by making it
harder to skill up for newcomers.  Of course, they also take the
occasional opportunity to kick some of the tradeskillers in the
teeth (HalfElf Blacksmiths, non-WoodElf Fletchers, etc), thereby
increasing the already large disparity in numbers between main
character tradeskillers (you know, the folks who are actually
playing the game somewhat in line with TheVision) and the ever
more numerous twinked out tradeskill mules.

That statement is only true if you assume that every player defines
his or her "fun" solely in terms of xp and loot.  That, of course,
is patently false.  If RL events keep you out of game for a time and
you become separated from your friends, you'll want to rejoin them
now, not after an hour of tedium that has nothing to do with "fun".

In RL you can take a nap or immerse yourself in a book while you
travel.  That's not an option in EQ.

It was insufficiently limited.  If group ports had a 15 minute refresh
people would not have gotten in the habit of expecting instant travel.
If, along with that, EQ travel was actually interesting (piracy on the
high seas, roving bands of bandits to avoid, robber barons demanding
tolls to cross mountain passes, rare beneficial encounters that could
not be spotted by tracking and only occurred on remote stretches of
highway, & etc.) it would be interesting to travel.
