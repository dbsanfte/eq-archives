It's a well-known fact among vegetarians that meat eaters smell 
differently.  Even after they've stopped eating meat for up to a month they 
still smell different.  When you eat something (meat in particular), it 
stays in your system for a long time, and your sweat and oils will contain 
traces of it, enough for a sensitive nose to pick up.  Same with your 
saliva.  I was even munching on tic tacs the night I picked her up.

The clothes I was referring to were clothes that I very seldom wear.  And 
yes, it is reasonable that I won't wear something for a year.
