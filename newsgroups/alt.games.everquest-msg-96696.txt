Wasn't it always ? I mean 1-6 takes about what 2 hours (untwinked) for
an experienced player. How much difference is this going to make ?
Do you come back with full HP and Mana ?

How ?
Is the xp required spread across all levels or just "removed" ?
Have the just "Leveled the slope" or removed the "speed bumps" totaly ?

Good. It was always bloody stupid.
I pay for a high grafix game (and upgrade my PC so I can see them) and
then can't look at them 90% of the time (till 35 level). Damn stupid.

What the hell are you talking about Jazz ?
I have yet to see anythink that says that these changes will make it
much easier to get to 60. 
The no body before 10 will make about what an hour or twos difference
max.
The no spell book will likely make no difference.
The changes to hell levels I have seen nothing that tells me how they
are doing it yet, so can't comment. Can you fill me in ?

What kind of crack are you smoking this morning Jazz ?
Or do you have some evidence that shows that it will be easier to get to
60 after these changes ?

Cheers,

Jim
