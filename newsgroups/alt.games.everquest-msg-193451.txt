I think the extra bank slots is a fundamental change to the game.
As a new chr, you are serverely  limited by wht you can store for quest
items, bazzar or other sales. This eases as you can afford bags, boxes,
back packs. If you do trade skills, then you are effectively limited in
the number of trades you can pursue at one time.

I actually like the bank system, but think the number of extra slots
should have been given to everyone.
