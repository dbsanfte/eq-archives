There's a moron on UK RA3 servers who goes under a few aliases (latest is
Ezi) and is a good player but when he meets his match and more he will call
that person a geek, question the amount of socialising away from the PC they
do and other such lame comments, what you have said stinks of the same
jealousy and bitterness.
To be able to play this game at this you cannot have any sort of social life
and probably never have had, really? I have to admit that I don't play at
this level (don't play much at all atm) but I certainly do not feel that FoH
or anyone else are a bunch "lifeless losers and/or teenagers" because of
what they are capable of in EQ but I do think something similar of them
because they brag about it in such a way that shows little maturity or
intelligence.
