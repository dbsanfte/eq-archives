Goto:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html
Then type 'undead froglok tongue' into the 'named' box, and click 'search'.

Or if you are using firefox, and want to setup a keyword like i did, you 
just type: 'eqitem undead froglok tongue' directly in the browser 
location bar and press enter.
