Yup, only if the quest is an alternate path to getting flagged is it
possible to flag a group with one turn-in. At least that's the way it
was explained to me, so take it as 2nd hand info.  It would explain
why a friend of mine was able to get HoH flagged in a group but not
BoT flagged. 

I've spent a bit of time trying to get the pieces for the CoD quest so
I could try to flag a group but the Harrion Larva eludes us. Can't
find a nice safe spot where the 3 PHs (or what I think are the PHs
<g>) path through, and given the underwater mobs, some of which see
invis, it takes a pretty suicidal puller to grab em. 

Rgds, Frank
