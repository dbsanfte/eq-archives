Okay, shoot me.  I have no idea why, but when I read the first post, my 
eyes saw "Basra", no matter how much I looked.  :)  

If I say I'm sorry, and I screwed up, will ya forgive me?

And I retried al the searches I did before thatpost, and can't find the 
connection that was there (to me) the first time.

For the record, I stand corrected, and withdraw my argument.
