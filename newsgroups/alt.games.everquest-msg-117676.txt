First choice: Field of Bone
Second: Innothule Swamp

The reasons are legion, and mostly the same for both areas. Tons of
mobs. Not as many other newbies to fight with. Convenient merchants,
etc. and not a long run to other spots where you can do your next
levels, and to notch beginner dungeons.  FoB has the added advantage of
some seriously good newbie quests to do, which the old world zones don't
benefit from. (Assuming you're a lizard of course. But even if not, it's
still a great starting zone except that you need to bring a ton of food
and water, and selling loot will be a problem.)
