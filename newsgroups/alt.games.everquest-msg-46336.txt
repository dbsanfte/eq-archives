hehe, the 'safety zone' isn't a zone, it's having enough exp to be
relatively safe in L60. You never know when an emergency patch will
respawn everything, and the last thing you want is to lose L60 in the
middle of a raid. L59 warrior is useless at MT because they can't taunt
L60+ mobs

Lord Koi is a giant fish in north ToV, and his rare drop orb is a high
AC range item. Jaelen's Katana and Neverida's Horn are from Vuulak'Aeer
and Lady Neverida respectively in ToV and the Sceptre of Destruction is
from a warder in Sleepers Tomb. All very fast, high damage with a high
agro proc - perfect for taunting

Information is sketchy on what actually happens. It's rumoured that some
primal still drops from the other mobs in sleepers (it's just the
warders that disappear) along with changes in the mob there. There is
also a quest to 're-awaken' the sleeper I believe. But you're right, it
was inflammatory to arrange a quest like this to further increase the
tension between competing guilds on a server
