There's probably folks who have been playing for years who still don't 
know what that gauge is for.  Personally, I only about half understand it.

You probably hit F11 at some point.  Hit F11 again, and it should come 
back. :)  I mapped F11 to autoattack before I knew it did that, so now I 
can't tell that I'm going LD during every other combat.  Well, when I play 
a melee. :)
