Most of the time, the way you would do this is:

1. Change your drivers to standard VGA.
2. Disable onboard video (jumpers, bios, however it's done)
3. Install new video card
4. Install drivers for new video card.

I went to the HP website, and found that they do not appear to suggest any
means of performing step 2, and indeed seem to claim it is unnecessary.
What can I say, good luck.
