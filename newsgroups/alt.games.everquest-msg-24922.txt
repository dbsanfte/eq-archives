You read this and thought it was good?

To start with you cannot group items like that, ignoring the fact he/she
missed out Rangers and (as said above) Bards, any Item that would benefit a
tank class (I mean the real Tank class, the ones that, normally, wear plate)
should go to the tank classes to roll for. Just because it doesn't have int
or wis (really a secondary consideration for Paladins and SK's) doesn't mean
the SK or Paladin should not get to roll on it (if it's Warrior only or part
of a warrior quest then obviously) the same goes for items that give, say
25ac to a wrist location and also offer 5str and 3 wis, a warrior or SK
wouldn't want that or benefit from it? Of course they would.

Than this? Than what, Karnors? Does that mean all other melee? the bards and
rangers, missed earlier, shouldn't be in there? Or, all melee? I mean, why
would a warrior want to be in there anyway, Cobalt Greaves and Boots are
crap items. No one gets to 50 let alone past it without knowing what they
are meant to be doing.

Well, thankyou for quoting that little titbit of literary genius. Anyone
here that knows the zones he/she is referring to is prolly thinking, "Duh!
Really?"
Anyone that it would have helped is likely still in groups that don't
require a cleric to survive and the whole party melee's.

CF
It sounds like he has accomplished a lot in EQ which goes to show, you don't
need a high IQ to get on in this game, lucky for me :ï¿½)
