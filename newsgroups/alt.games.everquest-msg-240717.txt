A guildie necro typically would die so his corpse could hold his gear
in a summoned bag.  He was called to active duty unexpectedly and it
was over a week later that he sent back.  He lost more than what was
in the bag.  After some explanation to Sony about the reason for not
getting to his corpse, he got his stuff back.  Sony had to manually
restore him from a back up. It is dumbing down -- Sony won't have to
have someone trained on how to restore characters from the backups.
