Jesus, what a lot of hogwash, Sony really pulled the wool over this
interviewers eyes.

"Sony employs 120 expert gamers who sit in long rows of small computer
stations here, working around the clock in shifts of 50 to support one Sony
game, the medieval adventure EverQuest. "

That would mean a GM being on all the time. I not seen a GM in months. Twice
we killed mith marr with the projection bugged and not giving flags and
twice we had to wait for an hour for a "GUIDE" to turn up and tell us to
fuck off and quit whining. Today, diffferent guild killed mith marr and got
the same.
