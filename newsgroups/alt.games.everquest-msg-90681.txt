Sorry to reply to my own post, but I thought I'd pass along more info as I
found it. As of last Thursday (2/21/2002), Nvidia has delayed the release of
the GeForce4 Ti 4200 because they don't want it to compete with the GeForce3
Ti 200 and Ti 500 line of cards which were just introduced last quarter. So,
I was debating with myself, "Do I go with the GeForce4 4400 for $279, the
GeForce3 Ti 500 for $249, or stay slightly behind the curve and go with the
GeForce3 Ti 200 for $129?"

I'm thinking I may go with the GeForce3 Ti 200 and use the "extra" cash to
upgrade my RAM from 384MB to 512MB.
