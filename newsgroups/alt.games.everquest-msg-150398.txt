   Wow... all this time I've seen you posting on this group, and I've
never known that you had a death wish!  Interesting.  Well, ok, maybe
"dense" isn't the word that would win you a round of hot lead.  But if
you had picked "mule-stubborn and willing to quibble to the point of
insanity...", wait, that's not really a word.  Hmmmmm.
