Well, for a long time now I've been saying to myself, "If they ever put up a
new, non-transfer server, I would jump on it right away." This weekend it
happened. What a great new world to explore. Dispite the over 200 players in
every newbee zone it was a lot of fun. Two of my RL friends and I started
new characters. We decided to play characters we had never played before. I
chose a Mage, and they picked Druid and Monk. I'm not sure how this group
will play out in the long run, but we had a great time and made level 5.
(WOOT!)

Some interesting events I remember:

*Guilds starting up and recruiting level 3+
*Auctioning in East Commons like in the "good old days", but with links. Saw
a link for Stein of Mogook. (UBER!!!)
*People auctioning to buy Banded and Tattered armor, Silver enchanted
jewelry, and other low level crafted items.
*Someone asking for KEI every five minutes or so, and thinking they were
being funny/original.
*Somone offering Breeze at the tunnel, and getting a round of
congratulations on the accompleshment.
*35 traders in the Bazaar, and no lag there.
*I don't recall hearing anyone begging.
*Saturday night, just a little over 24 hours after the server goes live, a
guild member recruiting on a horse at the Freeport gates. People were sure
it had to be a GM twink, until it was pointed out that it was the "one shot"
horse from Befallen. (I wasn't even aware that there was such an item.)

Well, I know that starting over is not for everyone, but for me this seems
like a whole new adventure. Naggy and Vox are up. Seb is undisturbed and
waiting the first break in. The sleeper still sleeps. So much to do. I plan
on staying for a while at least.
