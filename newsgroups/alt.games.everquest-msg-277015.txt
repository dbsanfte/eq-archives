Your mileage may vary, but I'm fond of The Druids Grove. 
http://www.thedruidsgrove.org

  Used to read EQ Druids, but lost interest there a while back when it 
ended up being more of a place for the kewl d00dz to share tips on being 
asses. Haven't been there lately, so that may have changed. <shrug> The 
Grove has its share of whiners and gits, but there are some genuinely 
helpful people there also, and a lot of information.
