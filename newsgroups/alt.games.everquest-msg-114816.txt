    Go Invis. At your level you should be safe from the skeletons aggroing
out front. Once you're past the skeletons and one ogre guard, you go past
some elementals, then through a room with a few tentacle things and a mage.
Once past that mage, run to the pit trap and fall down it. It puts you right
in Linara's cell and safely out of aggro range of the things near that cell.
