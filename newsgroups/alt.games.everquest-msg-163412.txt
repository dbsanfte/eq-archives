Oh is THAT what this is about, more quests?

ST quests, though?  My guild is just now building up a serious ST presence,
and at the same time (having finally cracked Aary) probably going over to
Giants faction instead of COV.  If the ST quests require good COV faction,
then this is going to be really funny.

Personally, I refuse to switch factions, I won't kill the Dain, I won't
kill Lord Yeli, and while I'll go along on some other big target dragon
slaying, I'm really not going to chuck it all; every time my faction dips
below Ally, I go fix it... if that becomes too tiresome a chore, I'll stop
doing the dragonslaying, frankly.

I wonder if this means I'll be LFGuild in a month or so... but if ST quests
require CoV faction, maybe I'm rescued from this eventuality!
