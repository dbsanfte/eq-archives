26, going on 83 (assuming that you're only as old as you feel).  Not "old,"
by any stretch of the imagination, but not exactly "young" anymore.

Fascinating.  And, tell me, how did you come to that conclusion?  Is your
life so "hard" that you're old before your time?

I'd love to live in Isreal.  Of course, there are a few things stopping me.
I've spent my time learning Japanese, not Hebrew, so I'd have to start from
scratch.  Oh... and then there's my employer.  I work for my Uncle.  You may
know him, his name's Sam.... skinny guy, wears a beard and a top hat, and
stripped pants.  See, he's got me by a contract, and breaching that
contract, under current geo-political conditions can result in my death (all
nice and legal like, the UCMJ ensures that).  So, until I get out, I just
have to wish we could hit Isreal as a port.  We were supposed to be in Haifa
for X-mas of 2000, but then that whole U.S.S. Cole thing happend, and we got
Crete instead.

> gee i didn't know you have to be an amriecan to like George Clooney.
> or was that another one of your rules?

No, but your hotmail account pretty much ended any attempt at seeing if you
were truely from Isreal, or just full of crap.

> oh and sweety, kiss my ass.

I'm afraid you'll have to extract your cranium first.

> thank you god and have a nice life.

Oh I will.  Thank you very much.
