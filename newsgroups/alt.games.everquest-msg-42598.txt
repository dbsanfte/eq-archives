Here's another non-wise ass answer (and non top post too) You'll be lucky,
The amount of people who are selling accounts now (DAoC, anyone?) has gone
thru the roof and depriciation is so fast that it makes a Runic Carver look
like a good buy.

My guess you'll get $300 at the most (assuming you have more than just the
SK and that he is still wearing his "uber" gear)

I'll add a Darth Maul mug (clean as well) and a BT Easy Reach Pager to my
offer, come on man, I really NEED it.
