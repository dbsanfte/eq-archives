Iv seen lots of sites with discussion on what the stats of weapons mean.
Its not good enough.  First there is alot of diffference of opinion about
such things.  Second there are many other variables such as the class and
stats of the toon using it.  Further these sites are not always easy to find
and greater perponderance of people in eq dont know about them.  But what If
Sony every time it came up with a new weapon tested it in a number of
settings and posted the actual dps and hits and casters or kazam
posted the information.  I mean more information than just the states of the
weapons and what they mean.  Acutal parsed logs of mele showing us the thing
in action.  And further that players could do the same.  If it was more
formalized so you could be viewing a weapon on casters or kazham then click
on alink to the performance page where all this stuff was posted I think it
would change alot.  Then everyone would get a better feal for the weapon and
could start classifying them in their own way.  I think it would help even
out the price inflation.  Once the general population knows more the less
over priced items would sell over priced.
