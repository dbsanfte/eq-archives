This is the sort of activity I -like- a guild for; a constant supply of group
mates, a willingness to go do moderately difficult things to help each other
out, a chat channel where we can share with our buddies while not all doing
the same things.

The guild I was in used to be that way, but gradually turned into cliques who
did those things together but not with other guildmates, to botters who
basically solo with multiple characters, and to raiders focussed only on the
progression course for the guild, rather than going off on interesting
tangents.  This change all took place post POP, whether thats a cause for the
change or not I can't say.
