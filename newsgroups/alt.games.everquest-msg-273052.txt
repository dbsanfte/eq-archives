That does not make it legal.

Actually, it was not legal at the time, but it was done, and yes, by 
executive order.  The order itself did not specifically call for 
internment of Japanese Americans, rather it merely allowed for the 
internment of anyone deemed a threat.

The fact that a law exists does not make it a valid law.  If it is 
unconstitutional, then, it is not a valid law, no matter how many times 
it was used.

I am not debating the morality here.  I believe we are in full agreement 
on that part.

I am well aware of that, I know far to many people who are bigots in one 
way or another.
