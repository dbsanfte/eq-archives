Does anyone know what level of hardware it takes to play EQ at 1600 x 1200
with a full clip plane, and all graphic effects turned on?

I have a decent machine (P4 1.5Ghz, 1GB RAM, Geforce 4 Ti 4600) and my frame
rate drops down to the low teens when in Luclin. I belive I am processor
limited. What level of hardware do I need to get my frame rate up to (or
near) 30 frames per second in Luclin? Is this even possible?

Another way of asking the question is: "What is the most powerfull machine
you could buy, that buying a more powerfull machine would not give you any
additional benifit when running EQ?"
