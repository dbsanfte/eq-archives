I agree.  There are a bunch of Good druids (my guild has a lot of them).
But I have an explanation of why there are a bunch of immature druids too.
Consider this.  There are a set number of immatures that are going to start
EQ.  Lets say we get an even distribution among the classes.  Well, all the
enchanter and cleric ims find themselves groupless and thus stuck at very
low levels.  The melee types do ok, but can't solo and eventually the
reputation gets them out of groups.  So, they try other classes.  Eventually
they hit upon Druid (or necro) and see that even if they can't get grouped,
they can still do what they want.  So, you see the Druid class attracts the
ims over time.

I can only hope that as I get higher level the number of idiots decreases.
