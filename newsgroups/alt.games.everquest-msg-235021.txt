The guts of this suit hinge on the fact that you were conducting your
business on their property, evidently without permission.

Where does IGE conduct its business? Connected to EQs servers? To be
sure the actual plat exchange involves them, but the IGE guy who
actually intitiated the transfer could be in HK, and the purchaser
could be in Britain. Where is business being conducted? What
jurisdiction nevermind what computer? The legal community hasn't
pinned that one down quite so neatly as the situation in your analagy.

No. If Coca-Cola stops selling Coke, companies that relied on
transporting, bottling, and advertising coke will have to find new
business models. Coke clearly has no obligation to other companies
that profitted or lost  from its business operations or lack thereof.
