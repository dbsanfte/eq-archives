Naturally we Mac users are disappointed by the news, but not completely
surprised given how deserted our server is. 

But what makes us furious is that for 8 months SOE has been lying about
the amount of support offered for our server. Any posts even hinting at
a lack of support from SOE (including the very letter quoted in the
media articles above) would be vanish without a trace. And repeat
posters have received suspensions of their EQ accounts. Meanwhile, if a
clueless poster brought up a known bug, the ever-so-professional Sony
CSR would apologise for the inconvenience, assure the newbie that the
problem was being investigated, and that at least some of the issues
were scheduled to be fixed "in the next patch". Any sarcastic comments
on the likelihood of the "next patch" would lead to
deletions/suspensions described above.

It is not that Sony has decided it is not economical to fix the bugs on
the Mac server. It is that Sony has lied for 8 months, while punishing
anyone who tried to provide fair warning.

By the way, eqmac.com has an active forum area with over 30,000 posts,
including screenshots of threads which were deleted from Sony's
official boards.
