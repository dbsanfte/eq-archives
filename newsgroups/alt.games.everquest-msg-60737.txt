Verant attempted to do just this awhile back.  They changed the EULA in such
a way that it stated, we (the customer) give Verant the right to use the
eqclient.exe program to search our files and computer configuration and send
this info to Verant.  Without Verant having put this into the EULA, Verant
would have been in some deep dodo due to the Cyber Terrorist Act of 2000.
(Or was it 1999?)  Sony's own layers conviced John Smedely to take it out.
There was no way a video game software company could justify before a court
why downloading infomation about their customer's computers would be a
rational and legitimate need by the company.
