I haven't played in months.  When I logged on this week to Tunare it seems
several hundred light from what I recall from earlier this year (high
population servers getting up past 2500-2700).

Perhaps this move is an attempt to conceal an already existing trend in
declining users?

Their stated reasons are pretty sound, I mean there is more competition in the
field now and information is power.  I was surprised when I learned they were
going to make server population numbers available when the game launched.  No
other game does.
