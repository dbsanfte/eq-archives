What level were you at the time?  He was dark blue to my level 33
beastlord and he still kicked my fully buffed ass (and that of my
fully buffed warder).  This guy is #2 on my list of mobs to kill when
I can.  #1 being the @#!$!@# kill stealing misty thicket fatling
guards at the wall - god i hate them.  I fully blame the lack of
newbie armor item drops on them.  If they didn't run all over that
half of the zone killing everything they see and half the time it's
one of the mobs that drops a bone or something needed for the newbie
armors.  Have I mentioned how much I hate those fatling guards?
