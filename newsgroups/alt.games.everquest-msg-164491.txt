Some quests I used to PL a char up.

In Kaladim there is a chap at Paladin guild (Gunlock) who gives exp and
minor item for 4 bone chips, starting a new char I would use my main to buy
off vednors or famr stacks of chips and give them to new char  to hand in,
ding ding ding ding, then would give him back packs full of CB belts and
Pads, Ding Ding Ding, then back packs full of Aviak Talons from OOT aviak
island Ding ding Ding. Then would work on skills of the lvl 20 newbie )

This has since been nerfed. Shark Meat quest to Felwithe was great cos you
could buy it in Thurgadin until Verant stopped it.

Quests that give lots of exp are therefore a little unbalancing.
