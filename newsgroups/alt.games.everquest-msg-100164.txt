Do what I did when I didn't know my way around...  sit down, camp, pull up
a map, figure out from there...  Or better yet, print it out if you can.

were planning on going to Dagnor, Kedge Keep, or Unrest.

But Steamfont is a zone close to a 30s section, and also one zone from
LFay, as Gfay is...  Also 2 zones away from Mistmoore, which Gfay is as
well.
