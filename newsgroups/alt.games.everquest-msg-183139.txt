To be fair, scuttlebutt has it that many people in the uberguild were
appalled by the behavior of these two in this instance, and private
apologies were made.  While I think that's a good first step, they forgot
the second step... /guildremove those two.

Thanks. =)  I happen to think my guild is pretty decent too, which is why
I'm still here.  Our guild leaders go out of their way to work well with
others, at one point calling off an AoW raid even though we were ready to go
because another guild had started assembling forces before we got there.
Even though they didn't yet have the numbers and we did, our officers yanked
us out and we moved on to other mobs.  Classy move, which I really like to
see.

Well... all throughout my narratives I've been keeping them generic.  I
haven't used names of players or guilds at all, just so I don't let other
people form opinions of people and guilds they haven't yet met themselves.
Now, of course it would be easy to look up the name of Drinal's "resident
uberguild" - a lot of people who read my journals already know who I mean -
so perhaps it's not much ado about anything.  Still, I don't want to poison
a casual reader's mind against the uberguild - I'd rather they form their
own opinions.

I know that doesn't make much sense - I have trouble expressing the idea
myself.  Mostly it's based on the idea that if someone writes something bad
about me, I'd feel slightly better reading "some stupid cleric in pink armor
let our whole group die" rather than "Monual let our whole group die."
