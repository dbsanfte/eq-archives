No you aren't at risk from Battle Clerics as some call them.

You ARE at risk when the cleric clearly states OOM or low on mana
and HOLD PULLS while I med, and then the friggin puller goes off
and pulls 2-3 mobs anyways!

I see that happening way too often for my liking and I quickly leave those
groups that can't rein in their pullers that keep pulling even when the
mages and clerics
tell them they are low on mana.

Truth there, all right!  Just remember it's NOT soloing Clerics starting
most
of those friggin trains.  Clerics love to group!  We solo if forced to.

I was in a group for a SHORT time with a rude warrior who kept telling me
what to do on every pull!  He started screaming at me for heals and Envigors
as soon as he got back with the mob, and BEFORE he was down even a half
bub of damage.   He was a complete idiot!

I do NOT start healing the puller until he is down maybe 1-2 bubs health and
has
raised good aggro so the mob won't aggro on me for the heals.
Basic Cleric 101 stuff.

However, on the 4-5 pull of this treatment, I did make up some macros with
his
name in them shouting "swing, parry, dodge, riposte, dual wield, double
attack,
taunt" and so on si i could offer HIM advice on how to tank his warrior and
he
finally clued in that I knew how to run my chosen class quite well and was
NOT
putting up with his back seat "clericing" and trying to tell me how to play
my class
WRONG!

He appolgized, I decided to heal him after all (he was down to 1 bub by
then),
and we carried on.  The group was great and I've been teaming with him
on/off
for a long time now.  One of my favourite tanks!  :-)

although occasionally we both start ROFLMAO when one of us "tells" the other
one what to do on a pull.   lol
confuses the groups we are with though.
