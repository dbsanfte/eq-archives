and examples followed...

I joined a group of noobs in HHK, my ranger [ untweaked and my first, lower
than most people my level on HP, AC and ATK ] was the tank, and THEY just
kept pulling  ... I was trying to get them to stop, rooting to protect the
casters, then I got rooted and all five ran out...

Wait, it gets better!

They rez'd me right in front of the resulting train, yep, second death.

Later said they had cleared the train and offered rez again.  No thank you.
I know a trap when I see one.

Oh, kinda not relevant I guess - I WANT to find these guys again ...
