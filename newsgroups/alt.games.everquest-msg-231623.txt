In our guild?

We guild people, not toons.  Therefore, no matter how many or few toons come
to the raid, one person gets the DKP.  Before the raid starts, twoboxers are
required to say which toon they're going to roll with/loot for; if I bring
both wizard and enchanter, and say that my enchanter is main for this raid,
then if a cool wizard-only item drops it belongs to any other wizard - I'll
only get it if it's going to rot.
