Is there a way to raise faction with the merchants in Kelethin or 
Faydwer without using spells or wolf form?  Have a DE necro that's KOS 
to banker but warmly to guards.  I've been told there are no mobs that 
you can kill, and that the slaver and warrior guild quests actually give 
you zzero faction, despite telling you that you have raised faction. 
 Can anyone confirm a DE necro that's been able to bank in GF?
