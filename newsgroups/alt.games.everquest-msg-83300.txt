I have the 512 MB and also a 64 MB GeForce. I'm guessing you have a P3
800 processor and that's a typo. If so, your processor is faster than
mine. I currently have all the new models turned on, and have the
density set at medium. Luclin runs fine. I get a little framerate drop
in a couple zones, particularly Dawnshroud, for reasons I can't guess.
But none of it's unplayable for me.  Last night we were in Grieg's doing
an emergency CR for some guildies who took a TPW, and it was running
smooth as water.
