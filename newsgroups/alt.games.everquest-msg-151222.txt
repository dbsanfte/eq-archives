You say that to a female bard, and you will have her first born child within
9 months :)

Every bard would be floored.  It's not every day that people see us for more
than just a mana song.  My buff songs are really nice, but until people see
them in action, they don't see us as decent shaman substitutes.  Now, there
is no way that a bard is going to be better than a good shaman or enchanter,
but at least a bard can do some of what they do, and do it effectively.

Last night I had 4 songs going non-stop in DL.  (Doing some grinding....
*shudder*).  There was a chanter in the group, and yet she wanted me to mez.
The thing with mez is that while it's good in a bind, a bard shouldn't be
pulled in a group because they can mez.  Root is better than my mez right
now, and probably more effective for a group.

> Mana song just ain't everything, you know.

I've sent your application in to the God/Goddess Approval Board.  While we
can't offer you a full Goddom, we will be more than happy to give you a spot
as a minor diety at first. :)
