Root does suck at 29.  I noticed a lot better improvement once I got into my
40s.  I think that MOST of the time (over 50%) it lasts the entire time if
I'm not nuking.

Stop using Snare.  Use Ensnare instead.  It costs I think 15 more mana but
lasts 8 minutes longer.  If you think the fight will last more than a couple
minutes Ensnare is THE way to go.  It also casts faster.

Yeah, the fire dot is less than totally useful.  It's resisted way too
often, even by cold-based critters (or what SHOULD be cold-based...like
anything in Dreadlands) and the mana cost is rather prohibitive when it's
resisted as often as it is.

As to fleeing critters, a lower level dot + medding is the best way to go.

I'm not sure what you mean by Frenzy Adds...this isn't DAOC, critters don't
call out for help. :)
