Yeah it's as tedious as any prior system, no doubt about that. Perhaps even 
more so because of all the time consumed with each step of the process. 
Maybe too tedious, it seems to be having the effect of weeding out lots of 
players who had intended to become crafters but gave up after a while 
because of the complexity and harshness of the system. I'm having trouble 
finding high level crafters to make me the kind of armor that I can afford 
now. There is only one Armorer that I know of on Beta2, 1 Sage, no Jewelers 
and no Alchemists. No Weaponsmiths.  I'm not sure how they're going to deal 
with this issue. As it stands now it's probably weeding out more people than 
they intended and the system has a very mixed rep within the game.

As for it being stupid, that's probably the conclusion reached by most of 
the people who try it so you're not alone. Many, many don't like it. As far 
as I can tell after listening to all the complaints, it usually comes down 
to not liking it because it's not what people are used to in a crafting 
system and it doesn't fit the traditional role of letting players wind down 
after a hard day of adventuring. It's not "relaxing" and it doesn't promote 
social interchange and chatting, etc. And believe it or not, some players 
still actually complain that they can't watch TV while crafting anymore. All 
of this is true. It was designed to be an analog to combat and adventure, 
not a social activity. Whether or not this is a good thing for the market 
they are targeting remains to be seen. If the players were given a vote 
today, I think you'd find it something on the order of 70/30 against the 
system with a majority preference to return to crafting while TV watching.

In my opinion, the real upside to the EQ2 approach is that it really is a 
"Crafting" system rewarding craftsmanship. You can achieve distinction by 
becoming a true artisan, not just someone who sits and makes the same metal 
bits that everyone else makes. In EQ1 your final combines are exactly 
identical to anyone else's final combines of equivalent skill, there isn't 
as much achievement related to your skill and resourcefulness other than 
your getting to the point of being able to make the combine in the first 
place. That is of course a significant achievement (as is being in a raiding 
guild like Monual and getting awarded Hammer of the Ironfrost, which itself 
is a noteworthy accomplishment) and reflects your wilingness to apply 
yourself to the mind numbing tedium of farming ingredients and slogging your 
way to GM. I absolutely do not diminish such accomplishments at all, I 
respect everyone who has made that commitment and achieved that distinction, 
just as I respect everyone who has done everything necessary to get keyed 
for VT. But I dont view this as "craftsmanship". The EQ2 system  attempts to 
address this by rewarding those players who strive for perfection in their 
work, who go through all the steps necessary to achieve that rare and 
precious state of an item that is "pristine" and then save up their pristine 
components to be used in other combines so as to produce the finest final 
goods in the realm. These rewards will only come to those who go the extra 
mile to achieve the highest quality in their products. In other words, the 
real craftsmen. I think that's pretty neat and I like the shift in focus, 
even if it is a complex, and funky looking system that kills inattentive 
players.

Like I said in the original post at the top of this thread:  Wow, what a 
difference. People love it, people hate it,  but there's no question about 
it, this is something different.
