Lets just say I wouldn't have paid it.

Glowing Black Sword is a twink weapon.   It couldn't have been designed for it
more.   It has a decent damage delay ratio, but you can only use it up until
level 44.  It is a cursed blade, or as close as items come in EQ.   At level
45 it will begin to proc Neutralize Magic on the wielder, stripping all of
your buffs.
