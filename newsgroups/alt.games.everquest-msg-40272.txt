I believe the locate corpse song for Bards is level 4.

Get that 'mule' Bard up to 5th level, buy him a hand drum, (secondary hand
slot, can't equip until you've trained in Percussion Instruments), and you
and your friend can zip while grouped together across Norrath using Selo's
Accelerado (sp?).  With the drum, it's faster than SoW.
