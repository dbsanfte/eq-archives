another thought on this system for people who aren't familiar with DAOC, is
that doing these takes away from your over ability to even run from an
encounter, if things get ugly.  You can only do so many of your special
attacks before you run out of endurance, and thus cannot sprint away.  The
grahics are fun to watch even for spectators, and my blademaster used his
specials alot.  many newbs don't use specials at all in DAOC.
