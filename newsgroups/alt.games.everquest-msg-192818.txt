You'll probably get lots of good advice here, but I'll add mine too just in 
case it adds something the others don't mention.

The only way to find out in game is to try it out. The color of the icon in 
your spell book will tell you if it's an offensive (red) spell or a 
group/helpful spell or other. 

The best way to find out about spells is to visit the "known" web site for 
your class as well as Lucy 
(http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?classes=BST&source=Live for your 
spells). A site for Beastlords is http://www.eqbeastlord.com/ I'm not sure 
if it's good because I'm a bard, but it seems to be current and helpful. 
You can probably find more links there as well and I'm sure the forums will 
provide you with a lot of useful advice and I imagine there is a serverwide 
chat channel you can join while in game that will provide you with 
assistance as well (see that site listed above for that info).

This, unfortunately, is an issue in EQ. The only way to deal with it is to 
either group with people that keep the same leveling schedule as you, solo 
to level up faster or just bite the bullet and group with new people. It's 
really up to you to decide how you will handle it. Just do what you enjoy 
the most. If you like soloing, then by all means solo.

Lake of Ill Omen is a good spot to solo at your level, Paludal Caverns 
would be a place to get a group. North Ro, East/West Commons, West Karana, 
North Karana are all good places to go at that level. You will probably get 
a list of a lot more places. Try them out and go where you have fun.

Http://www.eqatlas.com has printable maps of most zones. The LoY maps 
(download better ones from http://maps.eq-toolbox.com ) are really very 
good, so if you want to spend the money it's not wasted. 

As for getting lost, that is part of the EQ experience. EVERYONE prior to 
LoY had to just wander around and learn to navigate by landmarks. It makes 
the game both memorable and frustrating, so the LoY maps are a definite 
trade-off.

Hope that helps some.
