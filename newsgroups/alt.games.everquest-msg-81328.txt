Ah, Biz, it was in response to another thread (can't recall which one now)
where someone started flaming you. I didn't want to go OT in the thread, so
I started another one (and now I'm glad I did, I got some laughs out of this
one ;) ) Yeah, it was another dumbass, and I've seen so many of them lately
flaming you (and a few others here whom I also like -- they will get their's
later :> ) that I wanted to throw in my 2cp.
