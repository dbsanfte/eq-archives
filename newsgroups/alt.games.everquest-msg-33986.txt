Oh, I have taste.  I demand an *expensive* cocktail lounge theme!  
Sheesh.

Actually, no :D I just GOT the heals first.  I'd see the guy getting beat 
on go down to half health, suddenly it'd turn on me, I'd go down like, 
half a bubble - FWOOSH, the little blue lights started surrounding me.  
I'd feel guilty if I weren't evil.

> And look who's the lightskin mule now...

I said I'm not MARRYING a light-skin mule.  Sheesh.  And I'm not marrying 
a light-skin healer, either.  Why marry her when I can get the heals for 
free?

Eh.  *Everybody* does that.

One downside to being a male I've found is that I shouted out something 
meant as a joke and it got taken as a 'wiseass comment' instead.  Ouch.

Bah. They only liked me when I was looking for a fletching kit the other 
night.  What the hell happened to them, anyway?  *Supposedly* the guy in 
East Commons beside the inn between the two orc camps sells em, or at 
least that's what everybody kept shouting, but he doesn't anymore.  
Somebody ended up giving me one for free.  I'm okay with that, except 
that my pride is wounded.

I'd like to play in a guildwar.  Well, eventually.  Like say, when I have 
half a chance of surviving :)

That I haven't done either.  On ANY of my characters.  I usually go with 
whatever their epic weapon and stick with that.  Otherwise, what's the 
point of levelling them ALL up (except for personal satisfaction of 
course, but that's what tradeskills are for, for me :) ) - I mean some 
people say "in case you get a really great weapon later on" but I'd just 
trade it for "a really great weapon" in the class I'm trained in.  Or 
sell it and deal with the weapon I was doing fine with before.  Either 
way *g*

And two days later I'm STILL laughing at actually seeing one.

Oh, you're just jealous.
