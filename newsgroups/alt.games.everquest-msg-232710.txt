Innoruuk (Inny to his friends and enemies alike(!) is not any more
only mob that can drop the SEoC.  Any of the minis can drop it now. 
Check out this thread:

wrap).

I've gone up there with a single group (I was tanking hehe) - two
rangers, shaman, druid, chanter and wizzie.  We ripped the place up,
but we were all level 65 though.  You might want to leave it a few
levels :).  Three hours, 4 minis and no SEoC :(  I've more or less
given up the idea of getting an SEoC to drop, I have 3 weapons that
are better than Earthcaller (in terms of dam/delay stats, not the slow
proc) so am not in a big rush to complete it (but it *would* be nice).

Swiftwind is still a great weapon, with its haste effect.  I've yet to
replace it, even after a year.  A nice haste item from PoE and I'll
retire it hehe.

Good luck on your endeavours to complete your epic.  By all means get
Swifty, don't be too bothered if you can't get the Earthcaller any
time soon, there are better weapons out there.
