I have no idea why, but i have the 1700 and I have the same problem and I
know it isn't my internet connection because my wife running my old 650
athlon doesn't crash, and we share the same internet connection...I thought
it might be my modem drivers so i downloaded an update for that and it
helped a little but i still get sudden drops to desktop occasionally
(followed of course by the 1018 error).
