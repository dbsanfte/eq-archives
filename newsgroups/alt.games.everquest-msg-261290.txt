Final Fantasy has unlock quests for every 5 levels above 50. I thought 
it was an interesting idea myself...
iirc from my casual reading of various sites.:
One's a collection of rare drops. They are supposed to be good xp and 
you can start fighting the mobs that drop them around the low 40s.
One's a series of small raids or at least full group of people already 
past the cap. (mind you an aliance (raid) can only be a max of 18 
people, so it's not like 'get 72 peeps together to attempt to level one 
of you to 56')
One is a series of instanced fights which will allow a max of 1 party (6 
people)
One's a trivia challenge (go find these 4 randomly selected people 
identified by stuff you learn by talking around the game and doing the 
little 'worthless' quests.. who was the guy looking for a new job that 
doesn't involve lifting again? There's a spoiler list that lists about 
50 possible clues you can get. I looked at a half dozen or so and could 
identify each person, at least with a general idea where they were.)
Final one (which unlocks 71-75) involves basically soloing yourself with 
about 50% more hp and a few wierd moves tossed in, to account for the 
fact that it's just an AI. With a few twists. Thiefs can win just by 
successfully stealing from him. Against a White mage, he will eventually 
  just give up if you can keep yourself alive several min. Etc.
