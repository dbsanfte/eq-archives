I don't think so.  Maybe at the lower levels, but certainly they have
expanded the exp range at the upper levels.  Talk to a tracker, they
know when zones are mostly green and all green.  EJ was all green to
me at 55, yet there is a good deal of light-blue there at 58, so it's
gotten at least a little bigger.  I'm also seeing a lot of exp giving
mobs in Lower Guk helping guildies farm twinkgear.
Any serious solo tracker (probably a druid) who can say exactly how
big the light-blue range is at 60?
