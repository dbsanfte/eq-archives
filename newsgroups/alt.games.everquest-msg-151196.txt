Well, at higher level, equipment can make a big difference.  When you are a
60 Cleric, instead of a 33 Cleric, and the success or failure of the raid
comes down to whether you can tank that big mob long enough for the
Enchanter to get it under control, so you can stay alive and get the
Complete Heal off on the real tank...an extra 200 AC from having obsessed
over equipment can make a difference.
