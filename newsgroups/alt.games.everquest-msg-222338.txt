A lot quicker

only thing I can think of is that #2 may not be able to use item #2.. 

hence its often 

heres item x, those who can use roll.. then the highest for that wins.
However, I can see pro's and cons for both ways

Your way saves a lot of time and faffing.

However, if you get a crap roll you might as well go to bed, the other
way just coz you roll crap for item 1, you may still get #2 or 3..

I wouldnt say mutant, but Id say its no more unreasonable .. everyones
always bitter if they dont get something and someone got something
they wanted..
