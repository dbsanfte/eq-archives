I got my lil' gnome wizard a dragoon dirk for melee and a pair of TBoots
when she was level 6 (we cleared the goblins for her on the way to the
gnomes) as an experiment.

She's level 39 now and doesn't have a stitch on.  Sometimes more mana
would be nice, but then again, she hasn't died one time in all the levels
between 6 and 39.

It's just an experiment, and she stays away from zones where critters
like rhinos and that crystal-meth loaded Gryphon in NK are around...
:-)
