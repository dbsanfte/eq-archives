It may well be that way on CT only.  I don't have a character high enough on
any other server to be able to compare.

I have a very low level character on FV, a shammy and a necro on Prexus, and
a low 20's BST on Karana.  I can't speak to camps on FV, because the
character is still newbie garden fodder.  Same with Prexus ... this was the
spot for my sample Vah Shir when Luclin came out (I was out of slots on CT
at the time), then the necro came about one morning when I was bored.  But
I've been a little further down the road on Karana.

I remember being somewhat suprised on Karana when I went to SK and found
that camps on the spires seem to be run by a simple rule ... if you can hold
it, it's a camp.  Can you hold just South?  There you go, have South.  Can
your group hold all three and the hill?  The whole place is yours.

The day the spire camp check went out and "Spires and Hill" was replied, I
was kind of taken aback.  I sat back, waiting for a huge arguement to ensue
... and nothing happened.  Got into a conversation with the one who replied
to the camp check, and it was laid out for me ... around here, if you can
hold it, it's a camp.  But as soon as you die or your group gets wiped, the
spires are open ... you've proven that you can't hold it.

I haven't been back to Karana since that day, so that could just be
propaganda put forth buy a spire hog.  But given the fact that there was no
discussion, it made enough sense that I took it as "The way things are done
in these parts".

As an aside, I find it very interesting how different the economies and
environments are on the various servers.  I can buy some stuff on CT for a
better price than on Karana, and vice versa.  It's just the way the
economies evolved, I suppose.  Every shill for KEI on Karana I remember
seeing included the line "Always Free for CRs".  You rarely or ever see that
on CT ... I guess the line of thought in the chanter community there is that
if you're in the Nexus or PoK you're close to the bank, naked or not.
