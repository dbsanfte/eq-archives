I, for one am happy to pay 50 plat. After all, at level 49, with a
KEI, I could expext to make about 300 plat during the time the KEI is
up. That's 250 profit, of which at least 1/2 came from the KEI being
cast. Also, I want those chanters who are casting to feel that it's
more worth their time to sit up in the Nexus bored outta their skulls
than to go out and have some fun. I have about 3 or 4 I regularly go
see for my crack, and always try to say something funny or
entertaining to them while the buffing is going on. I also always
offer whoever's in the buff circle free sows, and will usually tl for
them if needed. (Druid) Remember, it's not about clicking a button or
even how much time it's taken for the chanty to get there (even though
I've seen c3 scrolls selling for 35K in the bazaar). It's about the
fact that the chanter could easily be getting a group up on the planes
or in Sleeper's or some other Uber zone and could be making double the
cash. They are doing us a service, and we should pay appropriately.
