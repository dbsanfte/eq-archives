Well my lvl 26 cleric alt is in a large number of bits of his newbie
armour still. About 5 or 6 pieces IIRC. Its reasonably good stuff and the
advantage for thos as wish to shop etc is that it is easy enough to start
filling in the gaps of pieces not covered with bought stuff.

For gnome cleric then bronze though heavy was a good upgrade and lootable.
Too be honest though there is so much acrylia studded and reinforced on
the market in the BAzaar the prices are ludicrous for certain pieces
(obviously the skilling up ones) that you might as well buy those first
off. Looking for bargains on the bazaar netted me decaying chain links for
120pp and a bracelet of the spiritcharmers for another 135pp. Looking
around thre can get you some outgraeous kit at ludicrously low prices.
That tends to outclass anything you could quest or buy.

You can quest for crafted armour - think thats centaurs in SK that hand
out that quest set...allakhazam will tell you.

You could get into making armour, then you need cash and a time outlay but
you can make ornate chain which isnt too shabby compared to newbie armour.
You''l start on toolboxes and stuff and then make banded which are vendor
fodder really. Do this where you have the best faction to sell back at the
least loss. If you get good enough then plate becomes a makeable option.
Then you'd look at cultural. Again the main problemhere is that being good
enough to get the stuff or rich enough to buy tradeskill items which seel
expensive (many are foraged) generally means that you have enough cash to
get far far better kit than you would make.
