But that is the point to why I use the rat ear quest. I twink over the bags
full of stacks of ears and then the new character does not have to kill
anything or risk any death to level up. There are no wandering mobs at the
lake. To get there from Qeynos, run along the NW wall until you zone and
then continue along wall of mountains until the lake. Swim a few feet and
then commence to clicking your mouse button a few hundred times and in less
than an hour you are level 5ish closer to 6. Take any loot you get from
Raphas and sell at merchant in that zone but be careful of mobs...or just go
to Surefall real fast and use those merchants.
Easy, easy, easy.
