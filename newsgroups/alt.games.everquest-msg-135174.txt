I can't do it this way because I don't use my router in a normal manner, 
I'm not a networking person so I don't know what all of it's called or 
anything. I don't use the internal firewall and stuff, or dynamic IP 
stuff. I have multiple static IP addresses, so I use it merely as a hub 
(or whatever) to connect my DSL modem to more than one computer (each with 
their own IP to the outside world).
