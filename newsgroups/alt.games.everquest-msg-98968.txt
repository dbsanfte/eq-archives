Fighting some critter or other late last night (post-patch) I had one
occasion where my chat buffer was completely cleared - there was no
scrollback data in it at all. It had just about 10 or so lines from
the end of the combat I had just finished, nothing more.

I had not issued any of the commands regarding how combat messages are
displayed (heck, I don't even know what they are - will have to look
at the docfile eventually).

I haven't reported this in-game as a bug yet, as I figure it could
have been just a simple one-time glitch. Has anyone else seen this
since the patch?
