Well, I'm not an extremely LT player. Just about a year and a half
now. In that year and a half, I've leveled one char to 55. Most of
it (I would estimate 80% or more) solo due to RL constraints. Having
been around a few 65 chars who have been playing for 6 months or even
less, IMO, the LDoN route does not seem to generate players who know
very much. What I've noticed lacking:

1. Knowledge of any zones that aren't directly linked to LDoN.
Having to explain to people how to get somewhere every time
gets very old very quickly.

2. Basic knowledge of the game is sadly lacking. As in, having to
help do a CR for someone who wanted to check out the merchants
in the fort by the PoK book in OT when they weren't the right
alignment. And then spending a half hour convincing them that
taking their 65 level char in there to 'get revenge' was a stupid
idea, too.

3. Most people, when doing LDoNs, seem to make sure they are
buffed to the hilt before going in. Mana conservation, assisting,
aggro control, etc., are, IMO, also lacking in a lot of the
'65 in 60 days' crowd, too.

4. So many of the groups in LDoN are 'perfect' groups or even
'close to perfect' groups that there seems to be little knowledge
of how to work with a 'less than perfect' or 'not even 1% perfect'
group. The '65 in 60' seem to be, IMO, very inflexible. They know
one tactic and that's it.

5. (This one isn't a huge problem, but it's been enough of a prob-
lem that I'm going to mention it anyway.) People who have spent the
majority of their time in LDoNs just aren't as 'time conscious' or
'afk conscious' as those that haven't. Numerous times I've been on
raids with people who have done the majority of their levelling in
LDoNs who have to leave the raid just when we reach or are very
close to the objective. Or they go afk numerous times. For fairly
short periods, but they're used to the 'no repops' and don't seem
to quite get that afks will double the amount of time to get through 
certain areas because, by the time they're back, the repopping has
started and we have to clear it all again. (Yes, I know this is 
unavoidable in some instances, but the trend I've seen is that
the LDoN levellers are more apt to do this than the ones who aren't.)

AFAIC, the main problem is that the LDoN adventures are extremely
well-known now. Someone who started 6 months or so after it's release
has ended up grouping with other people who have been doing the
adventures so long that they know the layouts of all of instanced
dungeons, they've been through them enough times that they know
where the trouble spots are and how to deal with them and they
can tell the new ones just exactly what they need to do. That's
not a problem in and of itself in small doses. But when that's
*all* that you've been doing, when it comes down to it, you're
not able to think when things don't go as planned or nobody has
told you what to expect and what to do to counter if it all starts
to go down the tubes.

Most of the people I know and group with that are 60+ have made
those 60+ levels over the course of 2 years or, in some cases,
more and, while they're not perfect and will occasionally make
a boo-boo, whenever I've grouped with the ones that have made
60+ in way shorter periods, there has *always* been at least
one major (and usually very costly to the group) mistake that
has been made by them.

I think that's the thing. There is no one place to point to and say
'There's where you need to go.' IMO, it's variety that makes for
better preparation.

A while back, for my epic, we were in The Hole. Right before the
'main event', two of our four clerics left. So, here we were,
with two or three of the metal guys and two or three of the other
ones (sorry, can't recall what exactly they are) between us and our
goal and we have two clerics and one 50+ Druid left to heal four
groups. No way to consolidate down to three groups. We made it,
I got my epic piece and only had two deaths. I'm totally certain
that if we had been made up of LDoN levelled folks, we would have
wiped and wiped badly.
