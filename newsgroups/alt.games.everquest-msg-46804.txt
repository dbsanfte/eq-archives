>> is there a possibilty of buying EQ including all the add ons ( also the
newest one) together with one of those game cards just to save some money?
<<

VI just released a "Trilogy" set, which includes the main game and all
expansions to date. The Shadows of Luclin expansion mentioned does not come
out until December time frame.

As for the game cards, I've heard they can be bought at Babbages, so
probably at any other computer software store. I haven't been able to get to
the mall lately, so I can't personally verify this.
