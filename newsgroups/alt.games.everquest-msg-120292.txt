Hmm, could have sworn that the exploits were spelled out.  I don't know one
way or the other if they are exploits.

1.  have a guard almost kill a mob, root the guard when the mob runs, follow
the mob, mem blur/Atone mob, kill mob, get xp.
2.  have a guard almost kill a mob, charm mob, move away from guard, kill
mob after charm breaks.

I might have missed some, but those are two of the ones in question.

Running to the guards to have them finish off a mob that you cannot handle
is not an exploit, and th was not claiming that it was an exploit.  That is
what the manual talks about doing.
