I tried making a dwarf rogue first, but when I went to look at my
starting skills, abilities, I only had one of the two... forget which
one. Basically, I was looking for hide and sneak and the ability to
worship Brell. I dont' think the other rogue races can, can they? (Aside
from Dorf and Halfling, that is.) I mean, remember, this character is
never going to level or even get a single point of xp if I can help it.
He's just going to camp is short little ass in The Hole and wait for the
biggun's to drop dead. (Biggun's from our group or our guildmates that
is...... I'm not going to "play him" and try to make money off of it or
anything.)
