If you are under the mistaken impression that you are in some kind of 
slump and things will get better once someone helps you get to a higher 
level, allow me to disabuse you. Things get *harder* and *more tedious* 
with level, so even if you believe that paying for one game and then 
paying someone else to play it is perfectly reasonable behaviour, you 
may find that the actual results don't meet your expectations.
