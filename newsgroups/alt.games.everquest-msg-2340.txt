I always give my pet 2H weapon, like 2H rusty sword or something, during low
levels. Since all I'm doing is let the pet root the mob, or taunt the mob
away from me if it's a water one, and I'll nuke, I want my pet to look good.
I don't care if my pet fights slower or faster. He will never be able to out
damage my nuke anyway. A pet without a weapon is just a bubble or water or
mud, or whatever. It never seems right to me not to give my pet some thing.
By the way, when I loot a flute from a bard's corpse, I will give it to my
pet. And my pet will look like it's dual wielding weapons, hehe...
