Sony seems to be promoting EQ quite a bit more.  They've got a deal
with Intel and Gateway where you will be able to be preconfigured
Pentium 4 Everquest systems from Gateway.  I don't see any such
systems at www.gateway.com yet, but the press release is on the
Everquest site, and there was a store on Yahoo news.

They've also got a pretty bad ad in theaters.  I finally got around to
seeing Lord of the Rings today.  I don't get around to seeing movies
in theaters very often...here's the complete list of things I've
managed to catch in theaters since 1992, to give an idea of how
infrequently I manage to do this:

	Star Trek: Generations
	Wild Wild West (by accident...meant to see
		Phantom Menace, but went into the
		wrong theater, and decided not to
		switch because we might have missed
		the opening of TPM)
	Phantom Menace
	X-Men
	Gladiator
	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
	American Beauty
	Lord of the Rings

Anyway, I was rather shocked to discover that before the previews,
they now have *ads* in theaters.  *Ads*!!!  Anyway, one of the ads was
for Everquest.

It basically had a bunch of sequences produced with the EQ engine.  It
wasn't clear if they were from actual game play or were scripted
things merely rendered with the EQ engine.  Some shots that I remember
included shots of cities, and a shot of a bunch of Iksar standing in
formation.  They had some forgetable slogan in the voice over
(something like "Live the adventure", or something lame like that, but
like I said, forgettable, so I don't remember it!), and it closed with
a black screen with the Everquest logo on it, and a voice saying
"Everquest", but saying it in an odd way.

For people that have not played Everquest, I think this was a pretty
bad ad.  There was nothing in the voice over that said it was a game.
It could easily be mistaken for a movie preview, or an ad for a
fantasy book.  Even if one realized it was for a game, they didn't say
anything about platform.  Since console games are advertised a lot
more than PC games, I'd expect that most people who figured out it was
a game would guess it was a console game.
