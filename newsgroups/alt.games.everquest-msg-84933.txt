My druid is confortably sitting at 204 WIS, and a respectable, if not 
earth-shattering 99 INT. I've noticed, though, that he has a horrible 
time getting skills to go up, compared with my INT caster characters. In 
fact, things like foraging can't keep up with my leveling, and I'm a very 
slow leveller indeed.

Would it help to bring INT to 100 or over? I guess it would at least help 
one percentage point, but is there some kind of soft cap at 100 for skill 
learning, as there is for STA?

Thanks,
