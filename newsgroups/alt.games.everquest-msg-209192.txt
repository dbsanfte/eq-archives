Finally broke thru the Trial of Flame last night and we managed to
get three people access to 7th Hammer.  Was quite a rush beating
Flame the first time, that trial is just really really unpleasant.
Group that beat it was CLR, WAR, DRU, BRD, RNG, and ENC. 
We had to do some weird agro kiting until mobs got rooted (Imps) or
mezzed (Elementals).  Kiting is a touchy thing in this trial because if
you get like 1mm outside of melee range the mob runs to the pole in
the center which is a BadThing(tm).  Once a mob gets there they regen
at a really insane rate, cause a room wide AE DoT to go off, and if 
you let them sit there for ~90sec the trial is failed.  Failed in the
sense that no new waves spawn but some mobs get left that were already
up although some do despawn.  Key to winning I think is a) having a bard
, b) killing the imps first and fast, fast to the point of even having the
cleric nuke, and c) being even more on your toes targetting and engaging
fast than in any of the other trials.  Having 2 healers also seems to
help quite a bit, especially 2 healers with Radiant Cure.  RC can
abolish the roomwide DoT and while the dot isn't unpleasant all on it's
own it does add up and low hp agro will get you failed.

Now, the 7th Hammer room looks just like the main Trial staging area with
6 Tribunals standing around the edges.  The backgroud however is a really
nifty swirling blood red, and the Hammer (who looks just like a Tribune)
is standing in the middle.  Oh, heh, forgot to mention.  Once you finish
all the trials you can hail any Tribune in the main Trial area and tell
him "I seek knowledge" and he'll give you a flag and a Mark of Justice.
You use, i.e. hold the medallion in hand and smack the 'u' button, near
a blue doughnut to get teleported to the Hammers area.  After getting
over the "ohh neat looking place" stage we decide to test out the
Hammers damage dealing capacity.  To get the event started you hail him
and tell him you are ready to be tested or somesuch.  Immediatly after
that he just uncorks smackdown.  I lived thru 1 cheal and a fast heal of
some other kind before getting killed.  Hammer seems to have the potential
to quad for 1240 w/o defensive up and has an 800dmg proc.  Also, when
you start the event the Tribunals on the edges start doing a kinda nifty
synchronized dance involving swinging their huge hammers about like a 
baton twirler then at the end of this they grunt and one of two area wide
AEs go off, one's an earthquake type 800dd and the other is some kinda
sta drain + something else.  

All in all was quite a fun evening last night for us and I'd like to
thank the serverwide.age folks for giving gratz!  And even more thanks
go to those few, well one really Tea, who recognized Busby Berklee when
describing the Tribunals dance. :)

I think we are going to get the rest of the guild and associated raid team 
pushed through all the trials and make the Hammer another raid target for
us.  Should be even more fun.
