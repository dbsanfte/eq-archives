Actually it turns out I did own several, tucked away on alts or forgotten,
happily I have among those a range III item.

I was dissapointed to find that the damage I item my bard is sporting does
nothing for him, even though the only DD song he knows is well within
the level I range (12 to be precise)  apparantly songs don't count as spells.
I suppose this makes sense as improved duration, even a single tic worth,
would be a -massive- upgrade to a bard, increasing his power by a third,
same for improved casting time, where even a second shaved off would
turn a 3 song twister into a 4 song twister.  The improved damage or heals
wouldn't be all that major, range would help significantly but again not
be such a massive upgrade, and of course the mana or reagent conservation
ones would be nearly useless (there is the mana eating DD that would
benefit from that one, but again this would be proportional with the
effects we see with other casters)
