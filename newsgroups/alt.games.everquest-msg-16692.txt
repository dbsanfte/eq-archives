On the Prexus server, the player who goes by the name Strikingbeast
Razorclaws, of the guild Unity of Chaos, should not be trusted to pay
for services after they are rendered. If performing any for-pay
services for him, I strongly encourage you to get payment *up front*.

Specifics...

Morning of 6/21, my druid character was in North Karana. I was about
to log, when Strikingbeast broadcast that he would pay 200 plat for a
TP to West Commons.

Now, 200 plat is obviously a huge amount, but this isn't the first
time I've seen high level characters offer large sums for simple
services. So, I accepted his offer, went to meet him, cast SoW on him,
and took him to WC.

Upon arrival there, he went link dead. Of course, I've gone link dead
myself several times upon zoning, so I gave him the benefit of the
doubt. I waited in the area, hunting HQ bear pelts, for about 20
minutes. He didn't return.

Later in the day, I found that he was online. I sent him a polite
message alerting him that I was available to come pick up my payment.
Naturally, I received no response from him on that or several other
tells. I spoke to another member of his guild, who sent him a tell on
my behalf - no response, and Strikingbeast immediately logged out
again.

Now, certainly I'd like to have the 200 plat, but this isn't really
about the money - it's about the principle of the thing. A person who
can't be trusted to keep his word for 200 plat can't be trusted for
any amount, large or small.

So, if you find yourself doing anything for this person, get the money
in advance.

Fore warned is fore armed.
