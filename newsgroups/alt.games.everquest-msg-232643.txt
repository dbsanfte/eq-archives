Well, I don't claim to have been around since Beta, but, since I started 
playing certainly, which was back just before Velious came out.  Breeze, 
Clarity, C2, KEI, Tranq, VoQ all enhance your mana regen rate, regardless 
of what you are doing at the time.  Sitting, standing, attacking, 
running, doesn't matter at all, and, to the best of my knowledge, never 
has mattered.
