Why are all the servers based in the US? Surely Verant realise that not all
of their players work to EST?

Bringing all of the servers down at 3am EST for 10 hours is probably fine in
the US, but that means that no servers are avaiable to players in the UK
from 11am.

Would it not make more sense to have servers based on other continents since
the game is on sale world wide?

That would also have a pssitive impact I am sure, on Link Dead problems, as
it would reduce loading on US servers, and allow players to connect to a
more local server.

If Origin can cater for a world wide market with Ultima Online, I am sure
Sony and Verant could manage it.
