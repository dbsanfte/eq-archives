I already quit EQ, so what do I have to lose? *shrug* I'll try out both
EQ2 and Wow and go with the one I like better.  Or neither.

The person who said EQ2 is targetting for a different audience is correct.
How successful they will be in that, or how it will manifest itself is
hard to say.  WE do know that raid size is limited to 24 at the absolute
max, but raid size is not everything that makes a difference between
casual player and hardcore.
