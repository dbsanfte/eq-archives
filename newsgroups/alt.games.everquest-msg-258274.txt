It seems to me that you -are- advocating sheer stupitidy, if you want 
people going into an intersection to look only at the color of the 
light, and not to look for someone to illegally and stupidly make a 
right on red in front of them instead of yeilding.

I don't actually think you would do that, but I think for the purposes 
of this argument you simplified your position to such an extent that it 
appeared you were.

I'm trying to call attention to the difference between legal and moral 
behavior, to put things another way; I thought that the contrast between 
A) or B) and C) put the difference nicely, although I learned the 
concept in boating school many years before I could drive.

Someone quoted a (probably nonexistant) tombstone reading

Here lies the body of Michael O'Day,
who died maintaining the right of way.
He was right, dead right, as he sailed along,
but he's just as dead as if he'd been wrong.

In PA they recently passed a similar law, where the left lane is for 
passing only.  I've never heard of anyone actually getting a ticket for 
this, though, and I doubt that a cop would ticket me for slowing down 
when being tailgated regardless of the fact that I'd technically be in 
violation... or perhaps not, if there's someone going 45 in the right 
lane, and I slow from 65 to 60 in the left lane, I'm still not in 
violation.  This situation actually occurs fairly often on some of the 
long steep climbs along the Turnpike, where heavy trucks lose velocity 
and just trudge up the hill while people sail pass them at normal 
highway speeds in the left lane.

Not the same thing as what?  I'm pretty sure I agreed with you here in 
terms of legality.  Which concepts are you talking about?

No, in my opinion it won't be eased one bit.  I don't care how much the 
guy suffers, thats why I didn't mention him.  I care about me and my 
wife and kids and heck, my brand new truck, not one of which I want in 
an accident of any sort, no matter how legally right I was.  I don't 
want a broken fingernail, a scratch on the paint job, the stink of an 
air bag going off in the car, none of it.

The horrific accident is, however, a typical result in such cases, when 
vehicles collide people are often severely injured or killed, whether 
they are at fault or not.

Actually I do care a bit, I also wouldn't feel good about this if I 
forced him off the road, not scratching my vehicle in the least, but he 
smacked into a fire hydrant and died, just because I wasn't watching or 
decided not to slow down and let him get away with his illegal turn. 
I'd feel worse if me-and-mine were injured by that decision, but even 
without that factor, well, I'm not cold blooded enough to simply applaud 
the raising of the average IQ in the gene pool and move on.

Nope, there's a clear difference between presenting a hypothetical case 
which consists of elements that are happening every day, heck every 
minute, in this country, and one that has never happened.  Further, none 
of your hypothetical elements is in any way contingent on the behavior 
of either driver, so they aren't helpful in determining which behavior 
set is superior.

Attacking the concept of hypothetical arguments -is- a valid approach to 
avoiding the unpleasant conclusions that someone following the argument 
might reach, but its not a very good way, because hypothetical argements 
have been used in debate for a very long time and have generally 
withstood such attacks.

One element of such arguements is that they are also not terribly 
vulnerable to attacks on specifics; as you see above, when you question 
the severity of the results, I can quite easily cooperate with you in 
stretching the terms to find something you won't object to, bringing you 
back to face the actual issue itself.  -This- is where "we're just 
making this all up" comes in; if you want to play the same game, you 
have to show a case where I'd be happier to have been in the accident 
rather than yield the right of way even though it was legally mine.

I suspect you'll have a very hard time doing that, though.
