     I don't know where all the details you included that I snipped 
were gotten from.  I do know, however, that the Freeport newspaper,
the edition available since the last patch, talks about the coming
war.  Haven't read any papers from other cities, but I'd be surprised
if they didn't make any mention of it either.
