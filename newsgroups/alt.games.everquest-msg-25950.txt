Dex, hmm? I have a +9 dex veil, but don't really want to sacrifice 7
wis for that. I'll have to buff beg from shamans, I guess :)

And I shouldn't have tried to get point 81 from the quivers... my bank
was running over (still is, from sabertooth) and I didn't have any
silk at the time. I've gotten quite a bit of silk now and have 5
stacks of veggies to turn into ginesh (40 combines to get point 150
was the other reason I wanted to up my wis before more tradeskilling).
I'll probably go brew up some kiola when I burn the veggies, get point
82 from cured masks and then go with crystalline silk for a while.

Don't ask me about my smithing :)
