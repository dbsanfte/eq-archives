You're right about that.  *I* only did it once in 30 minutes, and that's 
when the bitching came in (well, once, then 30 min later)...but there 
were some that were doing it every few seconds.  Guess I just took it 
personally when it wasn't meant that way.

the shitty RL part has do to with having to go to the in-laws for the 
weekend...and finances...but over all it isn't..just venting, I guess

doesn't seem that way on E'Ci.  I have yet to come CLOSE to getting a 
group or finding appropriate level people with it...and I HAVE been using 
it.  Just seems that only a handful ever use it on my server.

Well, a nights sleep and not having to work today and logging on, finding 
two mobs beating on some guy (or girl, I don't know), who was having 
problems with ONE of them (20hp damage every few seconds) then my 
throwing a nuke and killing it in one shot...that kinda eased my rant 
fever.

And I'm not gonna quit the game, I'll keep trying for LDoN adventre 
groups, I'll keep working on getting plat, etc.  I will be taking a break 
(till early next week) from EQ...not my choice but may be a good idea.

And forgive my ranting.  Normally I take the game as it comes andjust 
have fun, but something about last night pissed me off.

Thanks for a dose of reality, Rumble.  I think I needed it.
