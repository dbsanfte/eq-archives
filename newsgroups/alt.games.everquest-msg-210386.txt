I assume you mean you'll get that much more damage on average, right? That
is, literally what you'll get above is 36% more _swings_ at the monster in a
given period of time. Actual damage done in each fight is somewhat
randomized, but given a decent sample size the actual damage done will
average out to about the same ratios as with the number of swings taken.
