Greetings all!
    Have been hunting Geonids in CC for a few days now.  XP is very good for
my partner (36th Lvl Druid) and the weapons-training opportunites for me are
quite good.  The monies to be made from the chipped gems also helps =).
Though it seems some gems (chipped blue diamond, chipped diamond) sell to
vendors for 120-150pp, and others (chipped bloodstone ?  I believe) sell for
only a few Gold.  Do any of these chipped gems have any use other than
vendor-fodder?  They all seem to have stats on the gems themselves, but I
see no way to equip them.  I've tried placing a gem in the first inventory
slot - both with a container and without - and I see no change in the
mentioned stats.
    We'll probably stick around CC until he reaches 37th and I hit 46th,
then move on to find 'Bluer' pastures.  What would you folks recommend for
this duo;  for XP?  for cash and/or loot?

Thanks for reading.
