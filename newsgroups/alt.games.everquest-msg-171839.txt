As I understand it, since the changes made to DoT stacking, all the DoTs
stack, unless they have fixed it.  They were not intended to stack, unless
they are seperate lines.  The intended change was to allow one DoT of the
same type to stick from each player that casts one, however, my
understanding is they basically made it so all DoTs stack.  I have not
tested this, so, none of this is from personal experience.
