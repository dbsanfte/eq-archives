Not the same rush involved I can tell you with great confidence.  I get
a kick out of FPS games, not very good at them, but the adrenaline is
intense.  Too intense in fact for my poor old heart, I can't play for

different, based not so much on flurries of activity, but on tactics,
patience and stealth.  Single player games with saves at any point are
completely lacking in this thrill at all since even the most complicated
manuevers can be done with enough attempts.  I think you may be at least
a bit wrong in saying that he is wrong, though the fact that I think he
is a bit right may color my perspective.
