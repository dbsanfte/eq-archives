From what I have seen, they have lowered it across the board.  I was about
to head to EK to see if they lowered it there, too, but it looks like they
did =(

I killed 10 ( count-em, 10 ) Giant Spiders in EC last night before one
dropped a silk.  That was easily a new personal record.  I bitched about it
in /ooc after 9, so, of course the 10th one would drop a silk.  I should try
that after the first one doesn't have one next time. =)

I was in Everfrost 3 days ago with the explicit intention of killing Woolys
for silk and was averaging a little below 1 / Wooly, I believe.

A gentleman was going to make Wu's pieces for me, so I was -really- wanting
the silks.  Of course, right before I met the guy, I wasted about 12
swatches on Cured ( for my own tailoring skill ).

On the way to Ogguk yesterday, I killed 1 random Desert Tarantula, and it
had 2 silks on it.  I'm sure that was just luck, or they would be farmed a
lot right now.

It ain't just you.
