It is my understanding that wizards didn't even have their aoe snare
at the initial release.  This may contribute to why it was not 'the
rage' initially.

I believe Verant fully intended for certain classes to make use of
quadding for exp gains.  It's relatively simple to see why:

* Wizard's snare is an AE snare, and can snare the wizard if they get
too close.  In a group setting, why would you want to AE snare mobs? 
It seems like a waste of mana for the most part, since most groups
usually pull one and mez/root park/offtank the rest.  Furthermore, the
wizard would have to get a good distance away from the mobs, and hope
they are all packed tightly together for it to work.  And if you
happen to get them all snared, what did that accomplish?  A 2 minute
window in which the group must get all the mobs down into low
health/run away mode?  AE snare just doesn't make sense unless
quadding.

* Druid's 'ensnare' can last > 9 minutes.  In a traditional group
setting, what need would you have to snare a mob for this long?  The
only non-quadding use for this, that I can see, is when you are trying
to get away from a mob.  For one on one kiting, the regular snare
should be sufficient in duration.  That 9 minute thing only makes
sense if one is trying to quad.

* Why would you give these non-tank classes AE nukes?  They are
obviously mega taunts and will break mez.  These classes will end up
having to kite mobs around the group to avoid getting hit.  Most
people stop using AE nukes in groups after level 10.

As far as sucking up all the mobs from a traditional group?  There are
only certain types of mobs that can be quadded.  A quadder poses no
such threat to a group.  Take dungeons, for example.  You won't see a
quadding there.  TM is another good example, where you have a
backstabbing mob that runs as fast as sow.  Not a good quadding
target.

I believe these classes were granted the tools to quad to make up for
their group deficiencies.  In particular, wizards.  Wizards just don't
get groups.  How can you compensate for something like that?
