I like decay, and I don't. It should be reparable.. and that sort of 
removes the point here.

I prefer level limits for items. Same net effect. If you simply are too 
'inexperienced' to attune to and make effective use of the 'item' then 
you get no benefit from wearing it... and you'll wear something else.

Scaling items doesn't work as good... because most scaling items are as 
good on lowbies as level appropriate armour, with the benefit that they 
don't have to be upgraded or replaced later on.

Trivial loot code is particularly tricky. Too many good usable items are 
  either dropped directly or are the result of tradeskill/quest items. 
It will reduce farming but not eliminate it.

I disagree. The aggro system doesn't need to be adjusted.

See 2.

I disagree. Some zones are dangerous... I like that. It kind of bothers 
me that at 25th level I can walk into Blackburrow kill the named mobs, 
and leave. If I had to fight my way in and out, against hordes of 
worthless greens... that would actually be some good anti-farming code 
right there. Sure at 50th I could still solo the entire zone... but at 
25th the combined might of BB might be able to take me out... or at 
least put up a fight.

The reason some players farm is for cash/bazaar fodder (vs twinking) and 
the problem is precisely the risk/reward issue. Its unbalanced... often 
the player gets greater rewards doing something far below his level, 
particularly since single pulling often becomes a non-issue once they 
green out. A better solution is to address that directly and ensure 
there are lots of worthwhile things to do at ones own level.
