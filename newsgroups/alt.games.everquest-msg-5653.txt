Welcome Matt!  welcome to school.... princess will b ur teacher today =]

first thing to learn is, i know just what i am aiming for but have neglected
to share that with u... so all u can do is ASSume u know what i meant....

second thing to learn is the definition of the word irony... the definition
below was taken verbatim from dictionary.com, so u can check the reference
darling =]

now, when u read the definition try very hard to relate it back to the post
i made about OMG Princes has another "s" in it... and SEE if u can RELATE
Princes/Princess to the definition of irony... i think u can without me
outlining it for ya... i do have that much faith in ya !

now... had i wanted to use sarcasm, i would have, but i specifically meant
irony  ;)

u r dismissed... dont let the bullies sully ur clothing on the race home !

peaceout, princessa
