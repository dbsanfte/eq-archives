That would be highly countered to what the spirit of the game is though.
It is supposed to be by its nature an MMORPG where you work with others
for goals and it is YOUR choice as to whether the goal is killing an npc
or helping it in the manner of a quest or such.

Players need that freedom of choice otherwise such events would have no
purpose if everyone had to act a certain way. If you HAVE to act a
certain way then how can you be rewarded for just doing what everyone
else is? The responsibility lies with verant to set up the event so that
they and their characters control whether or not they can be killed and
if they can be then there should both be a reward for doing the quest or
a reward for killing them.

Neither kiling them nor doing the quest should be a "wrong" choice. To do
so would be taking away a player's freedom and ruining the entire point
of the game. The GMS should know this and do events accordingly or not do
them at all. I don't want to play an MMORPG where everyone has to behave
a certain way and all be like me and all be nice and sweet and always do
what I or a quest giver wants, what the hell would be the point?

I think just having the game on a regular server not pvp and having rules
that you can't kill steal is more than enough without also legislating
how you have to behave in regard to whether you choose to quest with or
kill an npc, which is more or less what a gm in such an event is. All the
gm should do is kill the player if he can in the normal npc killing
fashion.

Disruption and interferring with the play of others is clearly defined on
the verant site and this does not come under it, nor should it.
