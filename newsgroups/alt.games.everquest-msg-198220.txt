Ah.   We had some difficulties getting flagged, to say the least, so we
ended up spending a lot of time in the harder sections of Nightmare.   Went
all the way to 65 there.

Mephits are actually the best source of Spectral parchments in the first two
tiers.  You just have to understand how the caves work.

1) Only the four rare mobs will drop Spectrals, (Agony Mephit, Painwrack
Hobgoblin, Fearsome Hobgoblin, xxxxxx (I forget, heh) bat.)

2) Rare mobs can spawn from any of their type.   (Any mephit can pop as an
Agony, any Harrowing can pop as a Painwrack, any Reaper can be Fearsome,
etc..)

3) Only one of each rare mob can be up at one time.   If an agony mephit is
alive anywhere in the zone, a second one will not spawn.   Bring a tracker
and hunt down each rare, if you're just camping the entrance, you're not
going to get a damn thing.

Other than that, the worst part of being down there is getting into the cave
complex.   Even when you know the trick, you still end up losing people to
mobs that attack through the entrance ceiling way too often.

Mephits were the fastest to farm for spectrals, since they die much easier.
64 and 65 you lose the exp bonus on them though, while the goblins still
give it, making goblins better experience.


The consorts were always permacamped.  And the ambush traps in the area
sucked.   Even if the little spiders don't have a lot of hit points, the
fact that all 4 of them can be harm touching SK's makes them dangerous.
