After I got double riposte I realized just how seldom I actually riposte,
and how even more seldom my riposte actually results in an extra hit
connecting.

Once you know those percentages, take 5% of *that*...  that's your chance
for a double riposte to add to your damage.

It's not something I'd get again if I found the points spendable again
tomorrow.
