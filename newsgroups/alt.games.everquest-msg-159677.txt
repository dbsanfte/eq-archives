Yep, 140ish people in WC, with the 50+ crowd KSing anything that twitched.
I didn't even bother to go, got the blow by blow from some poor melees in my
guild that did attend.  They had zero chance at killing anything once the
swam of high level players moved in.  Prior to that, on the day before
Halloween, a couple of guildies did get some drops, including a warrior.
