Yes, you can bypass giant faction entirely.  For some classes, the giant 
armor is better than the SS armor I believe, and there are some nice 
quests to be done that require giant faction.  The guild I am in went 
directly from Thurgadin to SS faction, and is now in the process of 
hosing CoV, albeit slowly, as there are so many juicier targets that we 
can do that are not in Velious at all.

Anyone with a way to invis, potion, gnomish vanishing device, invis 
spell, or friend to cast invis can run through Kael even when KOS to the 
giants.  There are no see invis giants on the direct path from one side 
to the other.

Ornate, and LDoN armor is generally better.  Cultural armor is better I 
believe as well, in general.  I still have one piece of Thurgadin armor 
that I wear, just have not managed to get an upgrade yet for it.
