Been thinking about this a bit more.  The combo I had listed
(stun/enstill/wrath) is something I use during solo'ing, so your
suggestions have been implemented for gropuing.

That being said...

Although I very rarely solo, sometimes I just can't get a group or (to
be honest) am quite picky about pick up groups and find myself
solo'ing.  To that end, I do the 

1) Stun it (Force).  74dd and short term parks it
2) Park it (Enstill).  Root
3) Wrath it (err. Wrath).  210dd

and then re-Enstill when that breaks and lather, rinse repeat.  When
it gets weak I just run along and bash on it a bit.

Is there a better way to solo a 35 cleric?  I know I could be doing
some perverse form of Fear Kiting (with no snare?) but I get enough of
that as a bard and am wondering if I'm missing better, more efficient
options.
