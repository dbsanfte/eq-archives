No, same AC as they have now, higher hate per hit.  More powerful bows could
have a knockback or stun component.

Not even close to the same thing.  Or maybe casters should have to go buy
their mana at 1pp per bub.  Mana costs casters nothing but down time.
Arrows cost rangers money, or are you suggesting that it's a good idea to
have rangers have to dump a few plat into killing each mob?  Maybe if we
make Summon Arrow a level fifteen Ranger spell...

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
