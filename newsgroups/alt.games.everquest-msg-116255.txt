For the vast majority of users, Win2k is extremely stable. With the
sheer amount of differing hardware and software out there, it isn't
possible to make an OS that works perfectly on every combination.

Why would I? WP sucked the last time I used it, and so I bought MS
Word. WP lost market share, and it was their own fault. Now I'm
familiar with Word, I own a copy, and it does everything I need, quite
well. I see no reason to switch back to a product that already failed
me.
