Hate to rant...but, is it me or is Vallon Zek no longer a PvP server? A tad
sarcastic, but I logged in tonight after a brief time away to find most of
my "buddies" cross-teaming openly. They say "The game has changed bro since
you've played". What the heck does this mean....change. Apparently PvP does
not mean Player versus player anymore there, team helps other team. There
are the odd exceptions however, but most of the larger guilds are now
cross-teamers.

I could be completely wrong, and if I am I apologize, but I'm curious to see
how many others are sick of this x-team bullcrap.

Before you tell me to take a leap of a cliff and join a blue server, I've
considered it and for the 75-150 bucks american, it ain't worth it.

The majority of the players I have met rock mind you and will miss em :)

Thanks for your time Eq'ers

Mak
