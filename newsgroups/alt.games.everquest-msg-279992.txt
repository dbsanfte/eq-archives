Thought the non-Aegolism line was mostly for dispelling mobs.  That
way they didn't lose all their benefits in one dispell of Conviction
or the like.

Some do.  I've been in groups where there was a druid as well and I
can tell you that when the druid healed and I went into battle, well,
I had some decent DPS.  At 67, with the latest summoned hammer (even
against non-undead), haste, and Reproach, I was out damaging the tank
by a ways.  

Of course if I have no backup healer then yea, I rarely nuke.  But
it's still nice, especially when solo'ing.

Their strength lies in keeping others alive to do what they do best.
But I think clerics are more versatile than most think.  If you've
ever read some of Monual's tales you'll hear about some non-cleric
like things being done.
