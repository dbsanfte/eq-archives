And then last night I pop down to S Ro out of boredom and discover an
event under way. The first indication I had was upon zoning in and
being pounded like a tent spike by a sand giant who was checking the
druid ring for snacks.

Once I escaped him, and looked around, I realized there were giants
everywhere. 

And the zone *wasn't* loaded with idiot messages. Aside from a "Holy
Crap!" (which echoed my own feelings rather well), the people in SRo
had almost nothing to say, and what little they said didn't paint them
all as pinheads.

Once the giants were trounced (I did my part and killed a whopping
one), I wandered north to the Oasis, and upon zoning in was again
assailed by trumpeting morons.

Weird how different zones attract differing qualities of players.
