Either bring five really good (and hopefully higher level) friends, or
wait a while. The AC hits fairly hard. Two places you can get him. One
is in S. Ro. Sadly, it's become "accepted" that KSing the AC is within
the rights of everyone in S. Ro.  At 32, you could likely not even take
him, say nothing of being able to do enough damage to get the kill and
the ring when a pack of higher level people will start pelting him as
soon as you get the first nuke in.

Second choice is the one in Ocean of Tears. For some reason that evolved
differently, and people take turns there and respect camps, have a
waiting list for the camp, etc. But he's higher level than the S. Ro
variety, so again, bring a lot of friends.

Third tip.... brew LOT'S of coffee or other stimulant of your choice.
Odds are, you'll be there for an extremely long time killing a variety
of "A Cyclops" and various green mobs (named ogres, pirates, aqua gobs,
etc.) until you see his ancient ass. If you're not the very, very, very,
patient type. Don't go.  I've got a pair. I'm nearly bald from the
experience.
