Stupid me..."I'll just kill ONE MORE centaur before logging...."  Why don't
I learn??  This is usually when I die.
Anyway,in SK, I decided to take out a blue Centaur Sheltie.  NP usually.
Dumped a ton of mana on it because I wanted it dead and I was going to log
on after.  Almost dead, skips pet and aggros on me.  NP.  Then a Centaur
Foal (green) jumps in.  Pet in bad shape, but still np.  Halfway through
that, another foal and sheltie jump in.  I have no mana, pet almost dead.
This is most certainly a bad thing.  Pet dies, they are on my pathetically
running butt.  Why run?  You can't escape a centaur without sow and I didn't
have enough mana to FD.
Here's the wierd part.  Suddenly I'm not getting hit.  I look back and they
are engaged in combat with a centaur.  No tag like sheltie, archer, foal,
etc.  Just centaur.  I sat down to med quickly so I could FD, but they kept
jumping on me, and then Centaur would pull them off.  This happened 3 times.
Then I ran like a French soldier so I could med enough to get off a FD, but
they had taken care of the Centaur and were all over me.
I died...again...
While I was trying to med I shouted asking if anyone had charmed a centaur
to help me.  I didn't see anyone around, so I figured the answer was no, and
no-one owned up to it anyhow.
Still...I died...
Anyone ever seen an NPC attack like that?  Why didn't that helper Centaur
have a moniker like Sheltie, Foal, etc?  I haven't seen one without it.  At
least not in SK.

Thanks in advance for any explanation.
