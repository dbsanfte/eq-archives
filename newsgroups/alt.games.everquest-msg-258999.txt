I've got a question about guild boards (not public section forums)

I've been wondering how many guilds have all sections of their boards open
to all members of allied guilds and pretty much anyone who wants to view
them?

The guild I am in allows anyone to sign up for membership and then allows
them to post and vote in guild sections. In other words, there is no such
thing as a guild only section. Is this a trend of what's to come? Votes from
allies measure up more than votes from within the guild too.

I've been around for about 5 years or so and this is the first guild I've
been in that insists upon having every post by their members open free for
all.

I'm curious as to how other guilds handle their boards.

thanks
