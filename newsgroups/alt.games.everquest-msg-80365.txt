J.Fred, it is only a game, after all. I have one that will make you feel
better though. My sister-in-law decided she wanted to play, after watching
me play for some time, so we created a Barbarian for her. Nice sturdy class,
right? Well, she's wandering around Halas, checking things out when a higher
level gave her some nice armor, 100pp and a good weapon. She thanks him
profusely, wanders a bit more, then I hear a scream issuing from the next
room. Her barb, it seems, was inspecting the well in the center of Halas and
*fell in*!! Let me tell you, that thing is DEEP. She drowned, of course,
being a newbie at game and at barb. I tried to swim her out myself, no luck.
She drowned about 5 times in that well in Halas, lost all that stuff, then
the guy who donated it wouldn't speak to her! (not that I blame him much.. I
mean, how do you even FALL down that well??)
