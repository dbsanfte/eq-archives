    The regen on it is pretty small. By higher levels, you won't even notice
if it's running.

    No, you're right. It was introduced before the big sitting regen patch,
and was the "first attempt" at reducing downtime for melees.

    Ever had a druid with Scale of Wolf? Breaks the same as that. So no
attacking, no spell casting, if you're a monk no Feigning, etc. The Feign
one is a pain in the butt, as this would be a fair discipline if you could
use it while Feigned.
