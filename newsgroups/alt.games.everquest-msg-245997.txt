BTW, I noticed your reference to "augmenting" ;-) and thought I'd post part
of a message I left on the rpg forum (where most of the CoH usenet
discussion is currently taking place) on the topic of Enhancements, for the
benefit of anyone interested. Someone had asked the question whether there
would be much diversity among Heroes, given the fixed power sets.
Enhancements provide part of the answer and are a cool element of the game
in any case. Herewith, my response.

************************
Yep, glad you mentioned that. Enhancements are the "loot" in this game and
how they're used is a big factor in distinguishing Hero effectiveness. I've
found that they make a HUGE difference in the effectiveness of my various
powers.

Every power starts off automatically with one empty "slot" for an
enhancement. Every odd level you attain (3, 5, 7, etc) you are awarded TWO
additional slots to place on any power, to a maximum of five on any one
power. This increases exponentially the variability among players because
everyone is free to enhance wildely varying combinations of powers, even if
they have the same power sets.

The generic kind of Enhancements available for sale at the beginning of the
game are called "Training" enhancements and will be used for the first 15
levels. These are really an interesting idea. They are level-based and
somewhat power specific. For example, you can buy an Enhancement that will
reduce the Endurance cost of any power. It can only be used with certain
powers, but will reduce the endurance cost of any power that you put it
into. And they are all cumulative and stack, so if you put 5 Damage
Enhancers into your primary damage power, you'll generate that much more
damage.

Then there are the Dual Origin (DO) and Single Origin (SO) Enhancements.
Unlike Training Enhancements which can be used by players of any Origin, the
DO's and SO's are limited to players of specific Origins. So, as a Magic
Defender, I can only use those DO's and SO's that are specific to Magic
(e.g., Mutation/Magic DO's or Magic SO's). All of these are highly sought
out and provide major bonuses to powers. I've never seen an SO, but I've got
a lot DO's in my main powers now. And let me tell you, they make a HUGE
difference in both damage and healing output. DO's become available at shops
when you get to the higher levels and I'm told that SO's will become
available via quests later in the game (I'm nowhere near that level yet).

Enhancements are level based too and can only be used -3 and +3 levels
relative to your current level. This means that if you're level 10, you can
only use Enhancements that are level 7 through 13. The effectiveness of the
given Enhancement will scale according to how it relates to your level. That
is, you'll get baseline value from a level 10 Enhancement if you are level
10. A level 7 Enhancement will provide that much less value to you at level
10, and a level 13 Enhancement will provide optimal value to you. This means
that you'll be constantly upgrading Enhancements, a guaranteed money sink
and a great idea to keep you always in search of new Enhancement
opportunities.

Another thing, you can also combine Enhancements, but only to a point. Let's
say you're a level 10 and you find a level 10 Damage Enhancement that you
put on your primary damage dealing power. Then you find another Enhancement
but you don't have a slot for it. Well, you can attempt to "combine" it with
the existing Enhancement and if you succeed, you'll wind up eating the new
Enhancement but with the Enhancement in your power slot upgraded a notch. So
it will show now as a 10+. You can do this twice, and result in a 10++. The
+ just raises the value one, so you could have a level 10 Enhancement that
winds up acting as a level 12. Note that if you are level 10 and you find a
level 13 Enhancement, you couldn't combine it because you can't create an
Enhancement that would result in a power being boosted beyond 3 levels from
you current level.

If all this sounds confusing, it's not in practice. But it's one indication
of the depth this game has and one of the cool sub games that is being
played behind the scenes, one that really does distinguish Hero types from
each other.
