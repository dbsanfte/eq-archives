Does anyone know where (or if) Lucy shows the lowest level a PC
must be before a spell can be cast on him or her?

Someone was saying the minimum level for Boon of the Garou is 42,
but I can't find this listed anywhere on Lucy's Raw Data page at
http://lucy.allakhazam.com./spellraw.html?id=3D1474&source=3DLive

It'd be helpful to be able to look up this info for other spells
like KEI and Bot9.

TIA
