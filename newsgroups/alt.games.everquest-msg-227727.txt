There is one valid reason for doing this which I detailed elsewhere in 
this thread.  Basically, if he wants to form a new guild, he first must 
disband the old guild as a single person can only be the founder of one 
existing guild.  That being said, there are ways to go about it with a GM 
that will allow the old guild to continue to exist (recreated actually).
