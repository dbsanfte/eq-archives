Plus, I don't think some of the "opposed" factions he mentions are
really "opposed." For example, you can't lead giants to woushi and
have them fight each other. They don't aggro on each other anyway. The
coldain and giants in great divide do, but the ones in wakening don't
on woushi. My guess is they did that on purpose so you could not train
some giants to woushi then stand back while they softened him up.

I could be wrong on that, but as far as I remember it works that way
and always has. 

The stupid dragoons in overthere just blindly attack every creature in
the zone. They KS everything from my evil friendly party there, taking
my xp away even if the thing was at 5 percent health. They'll run over
and kill a cactus, rhino, sarnak, whatever. Its not just 'cause I'm
fighting them either, since they will merrily run around killing all
the other ones in the area too.
