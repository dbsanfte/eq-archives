>>The easiest way to tell if your group has one is when they insist on
rollin
 for items they cant use when another group member can...<<

Had this happen to me the other day. Was in Cazic Thule, killing leezards
when rogue only gloves dropped
(forgot the name, don't play a rogue)

We had one rogue in the group, so he asked if he could have them.
(Considering he was the ML, I thought this was a good gesture). One of the
group members said: "roll for it".

So, we rolled for it. The monk won. He told the rogue to take the gloves.

Later found out that everyone of us (except the one who said roll) was
planning on telling the rogue to take the gloves if we won the roll.
