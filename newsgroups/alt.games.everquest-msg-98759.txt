Ummm........ good luck, I guess. Only played melees sub 35 and suddenly
at the controls of a 55 necromancer? That's the Norrath equivalent of
handing an Uzi to a chimp.

I like the sensible approach, though. If you're going to be *safe* about
it and spend the (very likely) weeks or months it will take to figure
out how to play that character to it's potential and not get everyone
else killed, that's at least a hopeful sign.

I'd go with seafuries. Easy meat. Just keep them down near the shore to
avoid adds for now, and keep FD memmed at all times.
