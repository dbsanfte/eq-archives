I'd like to point something out.  No, the Koran does not necessarily
advocate genocide.  Even if it did this would not justify perpetrating
genocide against Muslims.  But Al Qaeda interprets the Koran as allowing
them to do anything and everything they want, no matter how reprehensible,
to acheive their aims, and, worse, they go ahead and do it.  So whatever
you're trying to prove by quoting the Koran does not remove the necessity of
eliminating terrorists.
