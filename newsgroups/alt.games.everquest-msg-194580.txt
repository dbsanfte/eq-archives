It's a known bug with the Bazaar.  All the traders in zone will
occasionally get a free teleport to their bind point which can be
fatal if you're horribly encumbered (falling damage from a few feet
can be huge when you're carrying a large amount of heavy bags, goods
and pp) which I imagine was the case here.  Splat!
