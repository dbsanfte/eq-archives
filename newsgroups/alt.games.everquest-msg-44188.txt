Aye, and that is a different issue I raised in this thread; you
can camp that cavalier all day and all night and he'll never drop
a druid item for you.  Camps shouldn't so frequently be
class specific, there should be at least a hope of getting
something for any class.

Take Fear for example; odds of getting anything useful for half
the classes out there are vanishingly small.  Given a zone where a
large group of people is necessary and a good mix of classes is
optimal, why should there only be drops for half of them?

I point back at Kael Drakkar (and likewise Temple of Veeshan)
where any given drop might be useable by any of four sorts of
people, and whoever gets the drop will fine tune that to get something
for their class alone.  There's no whining that there's no loot for
(class X) that can drop in Kael.  Further, that loot can drop off
of (nowadays) any mob (used to be any mob in specific areas,
still not "camp Mob X for this sort of drop" even back then) in the
zone, so you can go in and find a good steady exp camp you
can handle, and not worry about Mob X being "camped already,
we might as well go home"
