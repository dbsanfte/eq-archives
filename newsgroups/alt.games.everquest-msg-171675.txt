Hi,

I am pretty new to EQ. I only have one character a Human Warrior currently
in West Freeport at level 4.

Another player just approached me and said they were leaving the game and
gave me 166 plat !!!

My question is what should I buy and where is the best place to buy it. I
dont want to spoil the RPG element of the game for myself by over equiping a
low level player, but I would like to make some use of the money. Any
suggestions.

Cheers

John
