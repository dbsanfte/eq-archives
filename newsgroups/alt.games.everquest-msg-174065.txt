Gah I dont know why I responded to a completelty tangential issue. Must be I
just love arguing with you.

The main point I am trying to make is that anti-americans , some of the left
in this country, and others et all are trying to claim our actions are the
ones of dangerous lunatics way out of normal behaviour. They are trying to
say we are the irrational extreme. I am trying to show exactly where the
irrational extreme really is to illustrate that our actions are both mild
and moderate.

A secondary point would be that 80% of Americans support action in Iraq and
some fraction of that does not think we are doing enough. The mild and
moderate approach does not sit well with everyone who has a semi-direct say
in how we guard ourself.
