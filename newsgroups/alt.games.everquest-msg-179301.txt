1) You can't generalise like this. Some onboard soundcards are great, as are
some onboard GFX cards. The only difference is that onboard sound/GFX
usually is the cheapest solution for GFX/Sound and therefor not high
standard or quality. These days however, onboard equipment has become quite
good and has alot higher standard than before. It is wrong to say EQ doesnt
like onboard sound, as EQ doesn't know what is onboard or not, it only
interacts with the OS and drivers. If you do get in trouble with onboard
equipment, I would say these problems are generally driver problems, either
buggy code or lack of compatibility. You should always check for DirectX
compatible GFX/SOUND equipment.

2) and yes, all motherboards i have seen and tested has an option to disable
onboard equipment easy. Infact, even my old 286 had the option to disable
onboard VGA.
