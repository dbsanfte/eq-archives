You quote something that I posted 3 years ago and expect me to remember
that?  I own both UT and Q3A.  I
wanted to try both before buying to decide which one to get because I was
a college student that was strapped for cash.  I decided that both
have their benefits.  If you think you can learn everything about someone
from two posts, then you are wrong.  I could send you a scanned pic of my
receipt if you want, it is dated 2 months after I posted both of those
messages.  I wasn't trying to "steal someone's copyrighted material".  I
was trying to be able to make an informed decision as to which game I
wanted to get.  I don't use demos for that purpose because demos are
intended to sell the game.  They don't fully allow you to see the full
capabilities of the game before playing.  In fact, I had played the demos
for both and was still undecided.
