Hello,

     Can anyone explain to me what the different types of PvP 
servers are all about? I've noticed a PvP Deity Alliance (Sullon Zek)
and a PvP Teams (Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek). How, exactly, does 
this work? For instance: On a teams server, can you only kill people
on a team? What constitutes a team: simply forming a group, or 
actually joining a guild? On the Deity Alliance Server: Muh? Does
everyone kill the agnostics? Any info you can provide would be
appreciated.
