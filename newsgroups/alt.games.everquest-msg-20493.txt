No, I am not.  I am listing motives that some name
petitioners have specifically admitted to in the past.

Those aren't the *only* motives, certainly, but I did
not claim the list was exhaustive, only some of the
more specious ones that have been used.

He asked what made my own criteria for petitioning names
any different from anyone else's.  I listed some of the
differences between my own criteria, and some other people's
criteria, to highlight the distinction for him.

Where did I ever claim to "know everyone else's motives"?

If you're misreading the phrase "other people" to mean
"all other people", then I invite you work on your reading
comprehension.
