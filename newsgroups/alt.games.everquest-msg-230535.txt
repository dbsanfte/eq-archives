Can I just throw in at this stage (vaguely off-topic, I know, and most 
folk prob'ly know already) a reminder that some online banking customers 
are being targeted with fraudulent emails claiming to be from the bank 
asking for passwords, account numbers and other access info.  These're 
usually very convincing and contain links to what looks like your bank's 
URL, but actually route to the scumbag's own site (also convincing) where 
they collect all your confidential info.  I've had three of these so far 
(two from banks I don't uise, which semt oddly pointless), but luckily I 
knew about it in advance so din't get caught.

Like I said, just thought I'd mention it cos it's almost on the same 
lines.  don't ever take any email at face value, and never take chances 
with your security.  If you're not 100% sure, don' open it, or d/l it, 
click it, don't even reply to it.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
