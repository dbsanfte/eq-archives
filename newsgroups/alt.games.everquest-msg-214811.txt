   Lots of people have done that.  Lots of people have also shared
needles.  Just because alot of people have done something, doesn't make
it a good idea.

   Granted, it's probably alot riskier for the buyer of the accounts
than the seller, but alot of people think they are both equally
slimey.   When you sell an account with a high level character, you are
turning that character over to someone who in all probablity doesn't
know how to play that character effectively.  Alot of people have been
killed, alot of groups wiped, because they unwittedly took an "ebayed"
toon into their ranks.
