When I beta-ed it, I bought a disk for 5 bucks from EB that contained a link
to their site.  That was where I downloaded the client.  So yes, the client
was available for download once you had the key from the preorder.

Sadly, they never reconciled the ATI card issue I was having, so I stopped
playing when beta ended.  I used the 5 bucks spent on the preorder to get
the expansion pack for Age of Mythology instead.
