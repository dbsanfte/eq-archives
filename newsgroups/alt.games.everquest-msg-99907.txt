Alot of places get overlooked cuz newbies don't know about the dungeons and
low level alts are sheep that just wanna get to same level as thier main.
How about Befallen? Unrest for teens (watch out for trains)?  Stonebrunt for
20s?   I got sick of getting killed in LOIO at 21, went to Stonebrunt and
solo'd from 21 to 25 or so. Only way to group in stonebrunt is if you bring
them, not usually any other people in zone but easy to make xp on kobolds or
run to zone if you need to.  Once I convinced people to come they were
impressed with the way the zone looked and always came back.
You could also try Paludal caverns in 20s, the bandit camp near shadowhaven
zone. Just,for Tunare's sake, do NOT pull to the tunnel.  You can easily get
overwhelmed by adds from the houses.  Not to mention, it can get very
difficult to get past a full group bashing on 4 or 5 bandits in the tunnel.
Best way is to go to the shore and figure out what you can pull solo or in
small quantities like i did.
You could stay on luclin for a very long time, currently I'm soloing in
Dawnshroud, I'm a 34 ranger.  You can also find groups in Dawnshroud easily.
I may go back to stonebrunt and fear kite some more gorillas and pandas for
variety.
I personally prefer outdoor zones but sheesh, you don't need to stay with
the cycle that so many people advocate.  There's also Blackburrow for low
levels.  Splitpaw for mid 20s-need group to go in tho.  Anybody else have
suggestions?
