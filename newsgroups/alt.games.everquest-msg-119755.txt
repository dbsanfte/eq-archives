Quotes from Conquest members:

"we're useing [sic] massive amounts of exploits and u send a gm down
here?"

"Any lead GM shows up, this show is over."

"yeah, this is the most impressive Itz-guyversploit [sic] to date"

"every guild exploits these"

and, of course:
===========
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:21 2001] Guildmember #2 told the guild, 'they plan
on nerfing 3rd?'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:25 2001] Guildmember #3 told the guild, 'yes
tommorow syc'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:36 2001] Guildmember #2 told the guild, 'so no snare
sploit?'
[Mon Jun 04 20:28:49 2001] Guildmember #5 told the guild, 'LoS! Rez!
Pathing! Agro! With our powers combine, we summon forth ITZLEGEND!'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:22 2001] Guildmember #8 told the guild, 'how would
3rd warder die then? zerg?'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:29 2001] Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'it wouldnt'
[Mon Jun 04 20:29:39 2001] Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'not without
60 people anyways'

This certainly makes any later claims of not knowing they were
cheating seem rather disingenuous.
