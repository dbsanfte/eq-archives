Hi,

Well i guess it is most for being able to say that i did it :)

But it shure is a good advice to leave all valuables behind, dying
half ways would not be nice if i can't cast bind affinity at every new
zone, but that is not before lvl 12.

I have a wizard human that i play in Qeynos and he was killed way out
in the western plains of karana, i had a rather tense moment getting
him back, lots of nasty animals out there and plenty of bandits as
well, and they where shutting the servers down for emergency patching
as well *sigh*

Have yoy crossed the lake rathetear? the eqatlas says that you can
swim i you have high swimming skills, any idea how high that should
be? i have 43 i think.

Thanks 

/Regards Berth
