Fair point.

Even with a 60 cleric, id still call myself "a monk" really... I've taken
the cleric on several raids (most recent being Lord Yeli on Tuesday).. but
thats always just as a group healer.

I don't join the raid healer channel, and Im never asked to be in the cheal
rotation etc (I've only ever had to do it once, for a Vindi run a while
back).. I'll toss the MA a elixiar or divine light/remedy if needs be.. but
thats as far as it goes
