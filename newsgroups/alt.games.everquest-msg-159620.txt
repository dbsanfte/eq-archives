I have found that quadding 4 yellow/red rhinos in Eastern Wastes gives even
more experience. I've started doing that at 38 with kei. I should have
started earlier. I can do it without kei, but why take the risk?

By the way, the mastodons in EW are no good for quads because they run when
they go below 20% health.
