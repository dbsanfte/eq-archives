That's debatable, but why don't we take a minute to examine the record
of one of the most worshipped presidents in U.S. history: Ronald
Reagan, champion of supply-side economics, just like George W. Bush.

                                  Debt as a percentage
Year    Deficit     Debt          of that year's GDP

Well, well, well, it looks like Ronald Reagan TRIPLED the debt during
his term.  Very impressive!  And if you prefer to look at it in terms
of percentage of GDP, well, there you go.  (It's left as an exercise
to the reader to look up George W. Bush's results, which are actually
WORSE.)

This is from a President who said this:

"A trillion dollars would be a stack of $1,000 bills 67 miles high."
--President Reagan warning in February 1981 that the national debt,
accumulated over the United States' 200 year history, is approaching
$1 trillion.  (Under Reagan, the national debt would nearly triple to
$2.9 trillion.)

Even people who worked for Ronald Regan later learned the error of
their ways and now regret the part they played in championing
supply-side economics, like George W. Bush is doing now:

"[A] lapse into fiscal indiscipline on a scale never before
experienced in peacetime."
--David Stockman (Reagan's budget director) describing the 1980's

"In the Reagan years, more federal debt was added than in the entire
prior history of the United States."
--Richard Darman (Reagan advisor)

But maybe they're just disgruntled ex-employees.  It may be worth
taking the time to see what some respected economics have to say about
the Reagan years:

"When Ronald Reagan became President, the United States was the
largest creditor nation.  When he left the presidency, we were the
world's largest debtor nation."
--Lester Thurow, MIT professor of economics

"Reagan's theory was really 'trickle down' economics borrowed from the
Republican 1920s (Harding-Coolidge-Hoover) and renamed 'supply side.'
Cut tax rates for the wealthy; everyone else will benefit.  As
Reagan's budget director David Stockman confided to me at the time,
the supply-side rhetoric 'was always a Trojan horse to bring down the
top rate.'  Many middle-class and poor citizens figured it out, even
if reporters did not."
--William Greider

Well, maybe they're just all wrong, wrong, wrong.  Let's look at what
Reagan himself predicted:

"[A] drastic reduction in the deficit...will take place in the fiscal
year '82."
--President Reagan, news conference, quoted in The New York Times,
March 6, 1981.  (In fiscal 1982, the first full year of Reagan's
presidency, the government ran up a record budget deficit of $128
billion.)

Well, ouch.  It looks like he predicted the results of supply-side
economics all wrong...

Early in his presidency, Reagan chose as his economic advisors a group
that espoused a radical economic theory called "supply-side."  The
supply-siders told Reagan that if he gave tax cuts to the top brackets
(the wealthiest individuals) the positive effects would "trickle down"
to everyone else.  Tax cuts, they argued, would produce so much growth
in the economy that America could simply outgrow its deficits.  Reagan
bought into supply-side theory, which is why in 1981 he predicted that
there would be a "drastic reduction in the deficit."

However, Reagan soon discovered that his supply-side advisors were
wrong.  Tax cuts, instead of reducing the deficit, had increased the
deficit, drastically.  After 1981, Reagan made no more rosy
predictions regarding the deficit.  

At this point, Reagan would change strategy.  He would blame the U.S.
Congress for the record deficits that accrued during his years in
office.  Reagan would say that Congress was responsible, because
Congress had not slashed spending enough--meaning domestic spending,
since Reagan always championed increased military spending.

Reagan chose to ignore the fact that his own Republican Party was in
control of the Senate from January 1981 to January 1987, and that
Congress actually spent LESS than what he originally had asked for.

Federal deficits would continue unabated until the presidency of Bill
Clinton when fiscal responsibility would finally be restored.
President Clinton would achieve a balanced budget (and even record
surpluses) in large measure by restoring higher taxes on the wealthy.

And people wonder why Democrats accuse President George W. Bush of
being the butt-boy to millionaires and billionaires....  It might be
because....IT'S TRUE.

The United States is once again suffering under a "supply-side
economics" president.  Even George W. Bush's own father called it
"voodoo economics" and didn't believe in it!

The gap between the rich and the poor continues to accelerate and the
United States heads farther and farther down the path of having a
third world-like economic.  Just great.

Don't worry, Faned.  George W. Bush is going to win again, easily, in
a landslide election this time.  Congratulations, you win, and we all
lose.  (Oh, don't worry, I'm sure Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy will
benefit all of us any day now!  ...any...day...now...)
