Ok, so we got the new puters, we got the second account, put it under same
name...  No problem right?  Well, when we signed on with second account, we
put it on same card and went for 6 month billing as opposed to monthly.  We
also decided to change the main account billing to 6 months.  Didn't cancel
the account and resubscribe, just went in and changed billing.  Everything
appeared to be fine...  Until today.

Today I log on with second account no problem.  However, when trying to log
onto main account the error message of "You are not currently subscribed"
came up.  Reentered Credit Card info and so forth...  Now the error is that
the bank declined but did not give a reason.  (That is being taken care of
at the moment.  There is no reason for the bank to have declined it seeing
as we are not behind and blah blah..) ANYWAY...  LOL

I noticed, after looking over the previous few bills to the credit card that
Everquest bills our card on the 6th of every month.  Today is the 6th.  Is
that what the problem is?

Also, can we put each account on a seperate Credit card or do both the
primary and secondary account need to be on the same Credit card as well as
in the same name?

Sigh...  Out of breath and waiting for your advice...  hehe
