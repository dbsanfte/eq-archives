Actually, I'd place the wurmys performance a bit later than that; but yeah,
I think they're pretty good for most classes who know how to build aggro
and hold it when they're mean to. Just hitting auto attack and sitting back
isnt *ever* going to cut it.

Well, I wouldnt say superb post 50. Adequate, perhaps. I say this as a 55
ranger ;) But yeah, definitely adequate with a whole heap of side benefits
beyond the tankage too.

I dont think this is true; taunt gained by combat (as opposed to proximity or
health, etc) seemed to be solely generated by *number* of attacks, not
damage last time I checked. It was a while ago though.

Lol My earthcaller will get me killed if I ever get it cause I'll be busy
going "WHEEEE LOOK AT ME! TWO SPARKLEY SWORDS! TWO! 
NOT ONE! TWO! TWOooaoaAAGGGGH

'ghghhhhhh



hhhhhh

*SPLAT!*"

as I run off the edge of the kael canyon admiring myself in third person ;)
