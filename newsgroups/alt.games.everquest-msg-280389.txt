Good point. And that's definately an overriding consideration for 
soloing. I was mostly refuting the previous posts argument that medding 
while casting was the "whole benefit"; your quite right that being able 
tank while medding is at least as important as beign able to avoid aggro 
in the first place while medding.

Another very minor pet bonus: You can also forage while medding. ;)
