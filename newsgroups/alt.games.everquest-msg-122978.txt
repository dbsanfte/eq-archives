Dark Elf Necro:
Nektulos Forrest (Solo)
East Commonlands (Solo/Group)
West Commonlands / Befallen (Solo/Group)
Lavastorm Mountains (Group)
Oasis of Marr (Solo/Group)
(gets a bit hazy here, there was some stuffing around then I found a good
spot)
(Tried Lake Rathe, The Overthere, Lake Of Ill Omen and others)
Ratraz in Neriak 3rd Quarter (Solo) <--- SO good for the level, slow spawn
but 5pp min per kill is nice
Lake Rathe (Solo)
North Karana (Solo/Group)
Warsliks Woods (Solo)
Dalnir (Solo/Group)
Ocean Of Tears (Solo)

This has taken me too 34. I have been to HEAPS of other places but often
dont really get into it and go elsewhere looking for action. I may have some
of the orders wrong but thats more or less correct.
