   I have an important update!

   The link we were provide is to a hacked version of the game.  It was doctored
so that you could smack the holy bejebus out of the bird.  Here is the original
version if you want to play it the way it was intended to be played.

   I sorta like this one better.  The little distance markers actually make
sense.
