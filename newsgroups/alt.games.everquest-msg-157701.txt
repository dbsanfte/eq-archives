Note that neither of them have felt the need to respond to my post, or
the post of someone else, saying "uh... I don't always get exp, and
they're not about exp..."  In my experience, those who say "it's
always the ones who get exp on every raid who say 'it's not about the
exp'" are the ones who are constantly bitching about not getting the
exp.  Well, now you got it.  So shut up and raid, and don't bitch when
you find out that your exp bar only moved two ticks of a blue while
raiding.

Or I'll have to get mean.

Well of course it's *nice*.  Which I pointed out when I said "Taellaar
got exp at that one raid, that was a REALLY nice change of pace".
Note the 'change of pace'.  Those who don't get exp are the ones who
have time to run away before the shit hits the fan.  I play both
sides, and trust me, it all evens out in the end.
