My guess is you are either part of a large, active guild, have a regular
group of playing friends, or are under level 50 and you are not aware of the
"can't find a group" problem. I like these new summonings but I imagine
people will just ask mages to summon them but not invite them into their
group.

Secondly, I bet this is just part of the caster balance and not really part
of mage balacing and shouldn't be thought of as a perk for mages.
