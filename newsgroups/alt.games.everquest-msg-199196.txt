Been there, done that, except I managed to gate out while drowning and 
being eaten by whatever was in the water there.

Snipping will really help to make your postings more likely to be read.

I've had probably most all of my various characters killed in CB.  If there 
was no risk during your character development, it would be pretty boring.

The way to learn is to do.  If you don't try it, you will never know if you 
can do it or not.  Sure, sometimes you will die, that's part of the game.  
I have done a fair mix of soloing and grouping from level 1 to level 61 so 
far.  I still go out and solo now on dark blue nice xp mobs.  Sometimes, I 
try out harder mobs.  Usually, I plan for it, and manage to make my escape 
if that becomes necessary.  Sometimes I die.
