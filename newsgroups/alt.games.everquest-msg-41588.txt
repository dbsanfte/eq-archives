*comforts*
I'm sorry to hear of your experience with idiots.   Emotions are high
and that sometimes causes ones brain to phase out to the plane of
nincompoops.  Of course there are always the maladjusted,
emotionally bankrupt, mentally unstable folks who need to take
advantage of any situation just to get attention.  Then they can feel
powerful in that they controlled so many people.
