I would suggest that a paladin at that level who has never been there 
before should NOT solo in Kaesora unless he's got a gate item and a 
corpse recovery solution of some sort. Because if he dies at the bottom 
a paladin is not going to be able to get his corpse back.

Much better to do the entrance of CoM.

Another place to go is Gunthak (lots of undead, decent coin)
