Aye! For the record, these are the ToFS key, whose set I just happened to
complete last night:

1st Floor Mirror - Crystal Key
2nd Floor Mirror - 3 Toothed Key
3rd Floor Mirror - Frosty Key
4th Floor Mirror - Small Rusty Key
5th Floor Mirror - Bone Finger Key
6th Floor Claw - Large Metal Key
Final Key - Tserrina's Key (I belive this one is a quick jump to the 5th or
7th floor but i have yet to try it out).

Hope this helps,
Raven
