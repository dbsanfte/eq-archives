Congratulations big guy!

I hope this leads to many exciting experiences as "Main Tank vrs
Uber_MOB_02".

May the Cheals come timely!

PS  I am adding a minor "dickwave" of my own.  Today marks 1 full month
since I quit EQ.  The twitches are all gone (for the most part) but I still
find myself checking these boards occasionally.  No regrets so far except
for missing the few close friends I have made over the past year.  Take care
