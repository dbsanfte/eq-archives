Here is what you do. Before or during the patch process, double-click on
ZoneAlarm so it shows up on your desktop and have it on the PROGRAMS tab.
Once your patch is done and you go into everquest, you will get to your User
Name and Password screen. As soon as you hit connect, ZoneAlarm will come
through EQ and you will be able to select 'Allow Connect' and 'Block
Server'. If you do NOT have ZoneAlarm up on your desktop on programs prior
to getting into EQ, it will try to bleed through, but you will not be able
to click on 'Allow Connect' and 'Block Server'. ZoneAlarm recognizes that
the patch program changes each time there is a new patch, that is why you
are having this problem. It considers it a 'NEW' program trying to access
the internet.

This is how I resolved the problem, hope it works for everyone else. Would
hate to have people turn off their firewall for any period of time. Oh, and
just in case your wondering. ZoneAlarm does NOT come up in the game later,
it will not interfere with your gameplay in anyway.
