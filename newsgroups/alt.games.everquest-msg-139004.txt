Its not me doing it on purpose, its my news server.

I really can't do much about it but frantically keep cancelling the
duplicates, which I have been doing but it seems that for some cancelled
messages still show up :)

Its to do with the news server for my ISP its free for me. I refuse to use
third party news services as they add to my billing. I am on a volume based
cable plan and its the only way broadband is supplied to residential clients
in Australia. If your wondering  how much my qouta is its 3000 megs
upload/download, 10 megabit downstream 128kilobit upstream.
