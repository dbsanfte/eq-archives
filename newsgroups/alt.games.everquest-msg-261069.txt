The average casual gamer is playing a character between 30 and 50.  In 
fact, apparantly the majority of players are in this range.

This is what is so befuddling about SOE's approach to fixing classes by 
adding AA (which you can't even buy till at least 56, since none of the 
"class fixing" ones are in the General category... and even then thats 
56 + 6 AA, or in other words, sort of 62) or high level itemization.

That's whats so befuddling about their coming out with expansions which 
expand the high end of the game while doing little for their average player.

If you are level 65, you were at the top level of the game, I didn't 
even need to know that you had 170 AA on top of that to declare you a 
God; there's nothing the average EQ player faces that is even light blue 
to you.  Sure there are people with more AA and better equipment than 
you, but there are heirarchies in the pantheons of most religions which 
have more than one god, too.

Now that there are 5 more levels in the game, I'm willing to demote you 
to Demigod status till you cap out again.

Grage, 56 Berzerker
LLyric, 57 Bard
Splendid One, 65 Mage
Bergh, 65 Cleric

in case you thought I might have overblown impressions of what 65 means
