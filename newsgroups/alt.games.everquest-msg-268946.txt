Each player was allowed to have X vassals. (can't recall the exact 
number... 6 or 8 or so.) XP those vassals generated was bonused to their 
patron. (It didn't cost the vassals anything.)

The intention was to reward good patrons (ie those who spent time with 
their vassals helping, teaching, working with them). And it made the 
patron-vassal relationship 2-way... you didn't want to swear a never-on 
alt vassal to you because you would be much farther ahead with an xp 
generating vassal with vassals of his own. And similiarly someone 
looking for a patron would seek a patron who would help them, teach, 
them, take an interest in, and patronize them, if you will, etc etc and 
if their patron wasn't doing that, they could just sever the tie and 
swear to a better patron.

In practice what happened is that instead of the vassal-patron 
relationships being determined on this intended individual basis of 
mutual benefit guild leadership intervened and dictated the 'structure' 
of the trees to maximize their own personal/alt advancement, and/or the 
advancement of their friends/alts.

Imagine joining a large guild and being the GLs good friend, so he 
reorgs the guild, and puts a tree of fifty heavy players under you, 
effectively generating for you 1,000,000 xp per day, at no effort to 
yourself... while if you aren't the GLs butt buddy you got sworn in at 
the bottom somewhere and got to help generate that xp for your patron 
who you've never seen except to swear to, his patron that you've never 
seen, and so forth.

It was Amway Online. Just get a few keeners below you to recruit you a 
deep tree and do all the work, and sit back and reap the benefits. 

Unlike Amway, in theory the keeners below you don't need you... and 
could split or find someone better, the 'loyalty to the guild' and 
'guild pride' and other BS tended to keep people in line.

There were some interesting politics and guild splits as high ups 
severed and took an entire branch of the guild with them... but overall 
it was fairly stable, and by and large, not what the dev's intended to 
happen. At the end of the day, it was primarily used as a PL tool by GLs 
and their friends.
