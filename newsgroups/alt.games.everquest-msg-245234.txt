Which then encourages everyone to walk around in rags. And a loot
council tends to reward those the closest to the LC the most.. i.e. IC
:>. Loot councils are typically put in place by guild leaders and
their friends that want to control the loot to their liking. While
this works at a lower level where the loot isn't high.. people usually
ditch it as they get higher due to outcry's of IC hoarding. Trust me..
if you don't want to brownnose a Loot Council.. don't get in a guild
with one or you won't get drops anytime soon.
