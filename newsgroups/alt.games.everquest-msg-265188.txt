It occurred to me that, given that there are counterexample threads
currently going on (e.g., one about Weapons, I think?), I should add
something to the above answer to say that EQ II posts should make it
clear from the subject that they are discussing EQ II; the best way
is to include EQ2 or EQII in the subject.
