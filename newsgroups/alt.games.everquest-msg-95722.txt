As mentioned earlier, I would also recommend doing ulthorks and walruses in 
EW rather than OT although OT is quite convenient for a bard if you have 
the DE illusion mask (Mask of Deception from ghoul assassin in lower guk) 
what with being able to use the bank and merchants in the outpost as well 
as doing the sarnak braid quest. Make sure you wear the illusion all the 
time while in zone (ie. cast illusion as soon as you zone in and refresh 
every so often). You can even cast the illusion while running (just make 
sure to stop any songs then cast the illusion). Worshipping Bristlebane 
shouldn't be a problem as long as you have the illusion up. As an example, 
I know of Bristlebane worshipping gnome rogues who are not KOS to the 
outpost without the illusion. As mentioned earlier, you will draw aggro if 
you are buffing group mates that are kos even if you have the illusion up 
(personal experience as a bard) so I usually solo charm kite near the 
western zone wall halfway between skyfire entrance and the outpost. Good 
luck to you.
