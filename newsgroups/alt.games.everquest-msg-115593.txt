If you want to buy a port, have the cash ready to give to the taxi driver.
If you can't afford it, don't ask.  You can get EVERYWHERE a druid can
WITHOUT a port.

Don't insult the rest of the druids into thinking that druid=taxi.  I'll
port you if I feel like it.  I will not accept payment, but chances are also
pretty damned good I'll tell you no.
