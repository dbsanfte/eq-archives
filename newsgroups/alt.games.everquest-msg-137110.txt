No, soloing is the main focus for certain players, and it's those players
for which druids, necros, and beastlords were created.  Everyone gets to
decide what is most important to them in the game, and then choose their
characters appropriately.  The fact that a druid is not appropriate for
someone who wants to raid does not make a druid underpowered.  The fact that
a warrior is not the appropriate character for someone who wants to solo
does not make a warrior underpowered.  If you want to play a raiding healer,
play a cleric.  That's what they're there for.

My paladin has gained two yellows in a single day, while trying to find a
group.  It happens to everyone.

And I'll take solace that my five year old neice is more mature than you've
shown yourself to be with that statment.
