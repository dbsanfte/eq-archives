Ever played a cleric? We get to pay for expensive spells, armor
AND reagents. Oh yeah, and we have to pay those "greedy, stingy
bastard" druids for ports too... And if we get off our medding
asses to loot, we'll get yelled at for sure. Damned if we do,
damned if we don't...

I can understand Scott's desire to make money off rezzes, when
I was in my 30s, I was really HURTING for money. I was constantly
broke (no joke, empty bank account), and every plat I got usually
went to cover the aforementioned costs pretty much instantly...

I had 1000 plat in the bank for the first time in my life when I
hit 44, IIRC...

In article <8r9potgas7339jv3uaio6f5bp0p8ne80mn@4ax.com>, he went
on to say:

Yeah! Who does the cleric think he is, deciding how much his own
time is worth? Moneygrubber! Capitalist! He'll be first against
the wall when the revolution comes, Tovarich!
