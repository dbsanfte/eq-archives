PoP changed the game so much.. the levels, spells and skills closed the gap
between every other tier so much, that progression that was once vital in
the previous expansions can now be totally skipped.

E.g before you had a realistic chance versus mob z, you had to learn the
strat on x and y, and get sufficient gear...   DA positioning on Doze,
Knockback positioning on CT etc were once all vital to progress through ST,
Sleepers, nToV and high end luclin..

But now guilds can totally skip them, because they don't need those items
for progression.. just level 65 did more than learning mob a and b.. loot
from mob c and d.

They can start in PoP and just levels will carry them a decent way (a long
way, with the zergability of PoP), or totally overwhelm the mobs that once
required precise tactics/execution.. thus lessons not being learnt.

(General observations and ramblings, not an attack on Richards guild)
