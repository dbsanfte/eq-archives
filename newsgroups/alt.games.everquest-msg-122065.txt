I recently encountered the blind spell for the first time.  I was fighting
in a dungeon with deep drops around me.
What a helpless feeling, I would have died if not for good groupmates.
The question is this:  I am a monk, is there a keyboard command that could
have allowed me to feign death until the
blindness passed?
