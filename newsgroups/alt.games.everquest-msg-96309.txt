I guess that I generally agree. And I freely admit that the numbers that
I pulled out were at least some what dodgy. (Hence the log line about
what they actually represent). 

If you are saying that removing hell levels pre-50 will not
significantly change the speed to 60 then I agree.

If you are saying that removing all hell levels bar 54 and 59 will not
significantly change speed to 60 then I dissagree.

51,52 and 53 are not much worse than 45, but 55 is actually worse than
54, so are 56 57 and 58. 59 is just plain worse than anything.

I hope that that clears things up.

Jim
