I think that giving the double dmg bonus for stationary unrooted targets 
from a lower level makes a lot of sense.  It's obviously easier to hit a 
non-moving target regardless of your skill with a bow.  But on the other 
hand most people using a bow in the real world are lucky to hit their 
target at all if they don't have much skill with it.  I'd say a novice 
sword user would be able to inflict a lot more damage on something than a 
novice bow user.

I'm not exactly sure what the point of raising bow damage at lower levels 
would be.  Maybe these people just want to wear out the range attack hotkey 
on their keyboards earlier?
