Your example puts one line per auction command, I don't see how this makes a
multiline auction.  The only way to do what the original poster wants is to
type out a long auction by hand, and shift-up to repeat.  He doesn't want to
send a seperate /auc for each item.  If that's not clear enough:

/auc WTS item one for 900pp
/pause 10
/auc WTS item two for 800pp
/pause 10
/auc WTS item three for 700pp

comes out as:

Fred auctions: "WTS item one for 900pp"
Fred auctions: "WTS item two for 800pp"
Fred auctions:"WTS item three for 700pp"

But what fred really wants to do is:
Fred auctions "WTS item one for 900pp, item two for 800pp, item three
                        for 700pp"
