My room mate just got a new PC and I have networked it to mine so he can
share my cable modem and have net access. No problems with file/printer
sharing so far, but when I play EQ on his newer faster PC I get dropped to
the char select screen about 25% of the time. A few times it has even froze
EQ completely at the loading please wat.... when im zonint. EQ never shows
this behavior on my older slower PC. I would really like to stop this as
before I NEVER lost my connection in the 7 months since I got my cable
modem!

Here is some more detailed info on the PCs

Micron Millennia XKU (this is mine)
P-II 300
192 MB RAM
25 GB (2 Hard Drives)
Nvidia TNT2 M64
SBLive!
12x10x32 CDRW
Win98 SE

I have 2 network cards in mine, a PCI NIC connects me to me cable modem and
I have ISA NIC that my friend had that he was not using that connects me to
my room mates PC.

Dell Dimension 4100 (this is my room mates)
P-III 1Ghz
128 MB RAM
40 GB HD
Nvidia GeForce 2 MX
SBLive Value
WinME

I'm sure you can see why I would rather play on my room mates PC(no more
laggin in the trees, or anywhere for that mater). So can anyone give me any
hints as to help stop the disconnects while zoning on the PC that is not
directly attached to the modem?
