Probably true.  I am in less than uber gear, and short of finding a really
good group, I find I can still xp faster soloing at 52 with my shaman.  I
usually group with friends, almost never do pickups, not all of my friends
are necessarily a good fit for the xp group, or necessarily the best at
playing their class, but it's still fun, which is the point in the end after
all.
