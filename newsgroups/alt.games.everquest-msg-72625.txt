Most of the giants in Kael at the entry, etc. not only give you positive
hits for CoV (which we desperately need) and negative hits for the
giants (I've bottomed out Krom finally) but they give you plus hits for
the dorfs. However, I noticed yesterday that inside the arena, you don't
get the dorf hits. WTF?

I'd think that the stupid dorfs would appreciate you killing the
biggest, baddest giants far more than the gimp ones near the entrance,
at the bank, etc. I'd ask Verant, but I'm fairly sure I'd get the
"working as intended" answer. Is there some rationale for this?
