I second (or third) the Abandoned Orc Shovel recommendation.  Besides the 
good stats for your purpose, beating things to death with a shovel is just 
good, plain fun!

Also, my warrior recently acquired a Truncheon of DOOOOM!  And has been 
having an absolute blast with it, despite it not being the world's most 
efficient weapon.  But the point is, all that effort I put into whacking 
things with a shovel back in my late 30's paid off. :)

I suspect you may be out of luck on finding a good 2HP, since 2HP 
basically didn't exist before Luclin, and most of the ones I've found were 
unfortunately (for your purposes) fairly good weapons.  Berzerkers can't 
use 1hp, can they?
