As for your assertion that VI has missed their self-imposed deadline, and
that they often do, no argument can reasonably made to the contrary; it is
simple statement of fact.  I do agree with that much, as I did from the
beginning (although I did not mention it before).

Whatever you think of me or I of you, my point was not whether you were
right about the quality of VI's CS work or its Sys Admins.  I sounded off
only because you called someone you do not know a stock boy.  Whatever went
before, I think we can agree we don't care for each other, and I'm sure
neither of us will lose sleep over that fact.

This will be my last post on the matter.  If you want to post again, I will
read it.  Beyond that, I'll let it rest.
