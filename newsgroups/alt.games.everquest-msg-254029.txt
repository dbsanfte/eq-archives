Surprising I have followed the same strategy with my level 17 human paladin.
The magic skills have incrfeased as I used them. You should also work on your
archery skill. Once you gain lull at level 15 you can make creatures less
agressive and then use your bow to pull them one by one - Also get a long bow
rather than the hunting bow - twice the range. Work the armor quests and most
of the low level quests inFreeport and the commonlands for Pals and some of the
fighters ones as well. Find a group to work the orc camps and after lvl 15 do
the dervish camps in WC or Ro

This is what I did and I am starting to venture further out into the Oasis, SO
Ro and Befallen.
