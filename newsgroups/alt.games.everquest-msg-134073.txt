This is a great patch all the way around, but the two things I liked
best from the description were the /veiwport command, and the changes to
group structure so you could make a new group leader before leaving, and
supposedly eliminate those pesky group bug situations when somebody LD'd
or gated, or quit.

Pet changes, very nice.

New bazaar code? I'll wait and see.

New zone? Doubt I'll visit for a while, but heck. I may check it out if
I'm bored.
