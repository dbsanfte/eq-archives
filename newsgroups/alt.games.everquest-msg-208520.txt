That, or SoE decided that getting good xp off of guards was not what was 
intended for cities.  I know I spent a fair amount of time deep in 
Neriak, good xp, and good cash and cash loot.  I also spent time getting 
ally with the Paladins in Freeport, mostly because after a Lucan kill or 
two I was KOS to the militia anyway.  Again, it was decent xp, and good 
cash and cash loot.
