I had the exact same problem when I upgraded from a GF2 to a GF4. It seems
there is a Nvidia driver issue with DX8.1 and since Luclin requires you to
have DX8.1 installed, it really messes things up. A simple check on Google
with something like "GeForce 4 crash problems" should give you some links to
forums discussing the issue. I am still searching for a solution.

Good luck.
