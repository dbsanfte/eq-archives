Waste my time?  Sheesh... when you get to my level, a chanter spends a 
fair amount of time really, really bored in a group.  For some reason, the 
puller never manages to bring back more than 5 or 6 mobs, you only need to 
refresh c2 and haste every 20 minutes or so...  So may as well hit things 
to pass the time.  It's not like you have to med when you can just suck 
mana out of any caster mobs you have mezzed nearby.

And if there should happen to be two chanters on the raid, I can melee, 
mez the ones the other guy misses, and read a book at the same time.  The 
only realy annoying part is when -you- screw up, and just like you've been 
telling everyone else not to for levels and levels, you get the wrong mob 
targetted and break your own mez... Sigh. :)
