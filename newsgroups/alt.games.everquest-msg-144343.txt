    Yes.

    Oasis, yes. North Ro, no. Kunark was originally going to be included in
Everquest, so a lot of the features relating to it were still in the basic
game at release.

    In general, tunnel zone-ins ended in a dead end prior to being opened.
After the zone is opened, a "zone" area is placed before the dead end. Let
me use an example: when you zone into The Warrens, you still see an open
corridor in front of you when you hit the zone on the Paineel side. If you
could keep going without zoning into The Warrens, you'd go around the corner
and see a dead end. Before The Warrens was opened up, you COULD go around
the corner and see the dead end. Same with Paineel, Temple of Solusek Ro,
and the future zones they're supposedly building off of Stonebrunt.

    Most of the guildmasters were packed in wherever they'd fit. Some cities
have empty buildings already, like Freeport still does. Some places, like
Grobb, had no empty areas. That's why the Grobb BST trainers/spell vendors
are packed into the open room with all the SHM spell vendors - there was no
other space for them.

    Some were, some were not. Hate, Fear, and Air weren't connected to a
given expansion, for example.

    I don't think the portal structure itself was in Feerrott when the game
went live, so yes, that zone would have to have been re-loaded. Since that's
the only plane with a portal to it that wasn't shipped as part of an
expansion, that would be the only time they needed to alter zone files.

    Yes, it was added after initial release (so was Paineel, BTW). It used
to be that when you jumped off the cliff into that big hole, you zoned out
into Tox. When The Hole went live, that changed, to much whining and
complaining in the newsgroup months after the fact. ;-) They had events on
Odus, and for a while there were big, nasty wandering elementals in Tox.

    No *known* quests went from the old world into an unreleased expansion.
There were indications that some quests, like the one that leads to the
strippers in Neriak, may have been clipped off when Kunark wasn't shipped
with the basic game, but nothing concrete. Quests that are introduced in a
new expansion have been known to alter the old world, in some cases quite a
bit. New text, new NPCs, new drops, new ground spawns - all have shown up
when new quests go live.
