Here are some things that you can do that i have picked up. I have had
similar problems myself.

1. Always use the most recent drivers for your graphics card.
2. Use Directx 7.0a
3. Disable 3D sound if you use that.
4. If you run on cable check that no new electrical equipment is close to
the cable modem
5. run tracert luclin.everquest.com from the start/run bar to check your ISP
status. You do not want any * in that run becaus that indicates a server
timeout between you and Sonys gameservers. The luclin server is just an
example. You can run that whatever server you are on, the gameservers are
all at the same site, or so Veran tech says
6. remove directx, remove graphics drivers, reinstall directx 7.0a and
reinstall graphics card with newsets drivers.


Thats just some stuff you can do to fix your problem
Good luck..hope you can play EQ smoothly soon
