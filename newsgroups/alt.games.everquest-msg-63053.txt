I remember doing that in an older Zone alarm, specifically for Anarchy
online. Now that I only play EQ and kicked AO to the curb(amazing pile
of crap), I can't find how to do that at all in newer zone alarms
specifically in 2.6.357. I think it was "frequently changes" but I
have no such ability to mark that now in zone alarm.

There is "a remember this answer next time I use this program" thing
that I check on the pop up but that does not cut it with EQ, the next
time everquest.exe is patched I STILL have to reaccept.

AH ok:

file://C:\net_utils\zonealarm\Help\ZoneAlarmHelp60_Options.htm

Now look, there IS a thing that says "changes frequently" in that pic.
I DON'T HAVE THAT. I'm thinking zone alarm removed it and its now only
availible in zone alarm pro.
