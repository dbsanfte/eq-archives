Umm I hate to tell you this but ALL classes exp comes to a grinding
halt when you hit the 20 range. Then it gets worse in the 30s and
then again in the 40s. etc. etc. etc. If that is the reason you stopped
playing a character then quit EQ now and save the agravation.

Being evil and KoS goes with the territory of that class. Its much
less of a problem when you go up in levels and you get to learn
who hates you and who doesn't and you head to remote
areas like shadowhaven that don't have a problem with necros.

Basically I see you as giving up too easily. If you are looking for the
'easy' class or the most 'powerful' one give up now. All classes in
EQ have both their strengths and weaknesses. None of them are
'best' in every situation, but all of them are viable and valuable in
their own right.

For tips on how to play a class there are plenty of web resources
to choose from to help you.
