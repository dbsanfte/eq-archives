Hi All

I have immensely enjoyed Everquest however I have now played Neocron and 
money is getting tight as we approach Christmas so I am thinking of 
selling Everquest on. Neocron rocks for me but that's another thing.

What I have is:

Everquest Trilogy
Everquest Luciln
Everquest Planes of Power (effectively meaning all expansions)
Characters are not major Level 15 Palaedin, Level 10 Shaman
Everquest Atlas Maps of Myrist

As i'm based in the UK sale would be restricted to UK unless purchaser 
was prepared to cover postage of items to them.

Anyway onto my questions:

If I sell Everquest how do I transfer my account to the purchaser, 
bearing in mind he may be an absolute newbie and not have game already.

Plan to sell them all as a package unless feeling was that EQ Atlas 
(which is lovely and in perfect condition) is better sold separately.

Anyway appretiate thoughts etc, I apologise for the advertising nature 
of this post as well.

Miles
