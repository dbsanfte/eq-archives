*shrug* I got to thinking about it later and decided it probably didn't
violate so I didn't bother quoting any of that.  But figured I'd might as
well touch on this part.

He did come back and replied to someone who disputed his claim.  The way I
read it he more or less admitted to knowing that it was probably violating
the naming convention but he didn't care since 3 of his other characters are
already violating it.  Your analogy was stupid.
