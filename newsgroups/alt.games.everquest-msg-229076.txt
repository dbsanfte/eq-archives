** Shadowhaven Casino goes on vacation **

We're sorry to have to say this, but the new casino has become too 
popular.  The huge number of players gambling at the casino is causing 
issues with the servers, and has been responsible for a few zone 
crashes.  Unfortunately, this means that we have had to remove the 
casino NPCs until after the New Year arrives.


* Other Changes *

- Cancel magic will no longer remove disciplines or melee abilities.

- Fixed a bug that was causing the party to be unable to see hit point 
updates for the last person to join their group.

- Healing Will and Focused Will now stack with most other hit point 
regeneration effects.

- Corrected a bug that was causing AAs to increase the duration of 
combat abilities.

- We have reorganized the context menu for Disciplines to make it a bit 
more logical.

Headlines!

Melee Enhancements Part 1
New Spell Effects Live
Casino Now Open In Shadowhaven
HEAR YE! HEAR YE!  Check with your Town Crier for new editions of your 
hometown paper!



***  AA REFUND  ***

- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded (More 
details below).  If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA 
points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or 
less unspent AA points before you zone.  All AA points over 30 are 
removed when you zone.

- Improved Reclaim Energy has been refunded to magicians due to changes 
with the amount of energy received when cannibalizing their pets. If you 
have this Magician AA and were close to 30 AA points stored, make 
certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA 
points before you zone.  All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone.



** Melee enhancements **

We have been building an enhancement to the melee system, and the first 
part of it is now Live.

The yellow bar now represents endurance rather than stamina.

All Disciplines now require an expenditure of endurance to use.  They 
still have a re-use timer, and they can't be used more often than the 
timer allows.

Disciplines have now been divided into a few different timers.

We have also added a few of the new melee skills to the game.  These are 
the skills that do not use the new "opening" system, but can be used 
without an opening present.  The "reactionary" skills and the opening 
system will remain on Test for further tuning.

Warriors have been given a mitigation boost.  This affects all warriors 
at all levels.

Monks have been given the ability to dodge blows from attackers behind 
them.  This affects all monks with the Dodge ability.

All existing disciplines can be purchased as tomes in either East 
Commons or the Plane of Knowledge.  To learn a discipline, the Tome must 
be turned into your guildmaster.

Several new disciplines have been added for warriors, monks and rogues 
who are above level 60.



** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! **

Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven now houses a game of chance.  To play 
you will need to buy a King's Court Token.  You then take this token and 
turn it in to any of the dealers.  Based on what your hand turns out to 
be, you will be awarded a prize.  The highest hands will return a gold 
ticket as the prize.  This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as 
a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder 
Beads. Good luck to all that play!



** Items **

- Purchased augments, that have not been bound to an item yet, can be 
sold back to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro.

- Caerlyna in the Bazaar will trade your containers for tokens and will 
trade tokens for containers.  This will allow player characters to sell 
those tokens in the Bazaar.  Folks that buy the tokens can then take 
them to the Caerlyna and trade them in for the appropriate container. 
You can exchange most weight reducing tradeable containers for a token.

- We've changed the +12 Wis on the Copper Medal of Rapture to +12 Int. 
Really, we have!

- We have lowered the minimum duration to 5 ticks on Affliction 
Efficiency I-IV and Affliction Haste I-IV foci.

- Timeless Coral Greatsword will no longer claim to be out of charges 
when it procs.  If you own one of these swords, you will need to 
petition a GM and ask them to replace your current Coral Greatsword with 
a new one.

- Phylactery is no longer useable by all classes, only MAG NEC ENC WIZ 
CLR SHA DRU.

- The Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic now only procs for characters 
level 35 and above.

- The following items that had the Invigor effect now have Serpent Sight 
or Ultravision: Orb of the Crimson Bull, Abram's Axe of the Stoic, 
Tolan's Darkwood Boots, Mrylokar's Greaves, Singing Steel Vambraces, 
Crown of Rile, 5 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 5 Dose Potion of Fleeting 
Languor, 10 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 10 Dose Potion of Fleeting 
Languor, Potion of Wolves Blood, Potion of Fleeting Languor, Spiroc 
Wingblade, Spirit Caller's Boots, Spirit Weaver's Boots, Frozen Efreeti 
Boots, Ring of the Crimson Bull, Rune Crafter's Boots, Wolf Caller's 
Boots and Camii's Bracer of Vigor.

- The effects on Abram's Axe of the Stoic and Spiroc Wingblade are now 
Worn to activate, not procs.



** Spells/Songs **

- New spell effects!  Just about every spell in the game has been given 
a new spell effect.  If you have your spell effects turned off, you may 
want to turn them back on.

- Fixed the bard AA Channeling Focus.  It was allowing 100% recovery 
from missed notes in most instances.  We have restored it to the 
5%/10%/15% values as documented in the AA window.

- Fixed a problem with short-duration pets (Rage of Zomm, cleric 
hammers, wizard flaming swords and such) so that they will no longer 
dissipate before engaging the target NPC.

- Reclaim Energy will now return 75 percent of the mana used to summon 
the pet, 95 percent if the caster has Improved Reclaim Energy.

- Lull spells with duration less than 5 should no longer be lasting as 
if they had duration 5.  This will reduce the duration of some lull-type 
spells to their proper duration.

- Fixed a problem that caused Protection of the Nine to block Blessing 
of the Nine.

- We corrected an issue where the same druid damage over-time spell cast 
on an NPC by two different druids would not stack.

- Bulwark of Vie was reducing spell damage as well as melee damage.  It 
now only reduces melee damage.

- Eye of Zomm will no longer cause players summoned pets to suicide if 
commanded to kill the eye.

- Improved the melee damage on pets focused by Ritual Summoning.

- The magician epic pet can now Enrage when focused by Minion of Darkness.

- Increased the offensive capabilities of most pets when focused by 
Summoner's Boon.

- We have removed the Stamina effects from many spells.

- Fixed a bug that would cause issues with pet hit points, and could 
cause them to be unable to move if their hit points got too low.  This 
may also address other issues with pets using hit-point boosting items.



** Alternate Advancement **

- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded.  If you 
had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain 
that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before 
you zone.  All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone.  You may, of 
course, repurchase these AAs.

- Extended Notes and Sionachie's Cresendo no longer affects harmful 
area-of-effect spells.

- Jamfest has been fixed.  It will now affect the bard's group, not just 
the bard.

- The Archetype AA ability Spell Casting Deftness was not reducing the 
casting time for the wizard spell Harvest.  It does now.



** Tradeskills **

- Merchants will not pay more for a tradeskill product than the cost of 
the components needed to make it.  However, they will still sell those 
products for the same amount.



** Zones and Quests **

- Maelin will now respond as though you have the Quintessence, as long 
as you are flagged for time.  It is also now possible to receive any of 
the earlier progression flags, even if you have already earned access to 
the Plane of Time.



** User Interface **

- Tell windows now log the name of the person sending tells in the chat log.

- Tell windows now blink when a tell is received, even when the window 
is not minimized.

- Fixed a problem that caused users some ATI cards to be unable to see 
the /find path or the targeting ring.

- We have added a new combat ability windown which allows you to make up 
to eight hot keys for disciplines and other new melee abilities and 
displays any current melee effects.  The window can be opened by 
pressing Alt+C.  The keys are accessible using either the mouse or Ctrl+1-8.



** Miscellaneous **

- Added some explanation text to the targetindicator.ini file that help 
explain how to modify the targeting ring.
