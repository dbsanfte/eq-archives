The numbers by themselves look good, but they ignore a very important
thing...

A well-balanced group is greater than the sum of its parts.

And you sit down and med and heal for, say five minutes.

And the group can kill *more* than 6 similar monsters in the same five
minutes. Meaning that in those five minutes, your share of the
experience would be greater than what you would have earned soloing.

The impact of medding and healing in a good group is minimized, such
that the group as an entity rarely experiences any downtime - a fight
can be going on almost continuously.

I think the experience of most long-time players will show this to be
false, in general.
