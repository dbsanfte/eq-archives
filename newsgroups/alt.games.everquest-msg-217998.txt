Hmmm... I'm beginning to wonder if they changed that... I didn't get a 
skill up in SH in over 1 hour of pressing it continually. (I was 
practicing up my Brass & Wind which were lagging a bit), and my SH is 
around 165. I also got only 2 skill ups in Brass and Wind in that 
time... (both in their 170s).
I ended up leaving the bard on overnight in PoK... fluting one night, 
and screeching the next to get them to max out (for a mere 15 points in 
each skill, one night I checked in after 4 hours, to ensure I hadn't 
missed a note (I hadn't) and I'd only pickedup about 8 points)...

Bloody irritating... what sort of 'game' requires you to sit your ass 
online and go to sleep for hours at a time in order to play it. Between 
BS like this and having to be online to use sell in the Bazaar... it 
boggles the mind... why not cut down on bandwidth and just let players 
set up npc vendors.
