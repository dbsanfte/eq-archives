Yeah it runs okay in XP, better than 2000 or ME possibly. 

I'd buy kunark frankly. The thing is that kunark includes old EQ, so
if you buy old EQ (even that 10 dollar one) and LIKE it you will still
have to buy kunark to use kunark and kunark comes with old EQ so its
like you are buying it again. The thing is kunark is around 27 bucks,
so if you bought old eq for 10 bucks then its like you paid 37 bucks. 

Really if you see the trilogy on sale, its the best bang for your buck
especially since many people seem to say its hard to find velious all
by itself in stores now in case you want that. However, velious is
level 35 and up approximately so it would be some time before you
could get there. 

You don't need anything more than old EQ to get Luclin so you may even
buy that before velious if you just get old EQ or Kunark (which
includes old EQ) Luclin, like kunark, has low level areas since the
kitty race starts there. 

If you get computer gaming world anyway, with the CD, you can try EQ
for free. Problem is its only on a server for that purpose so you
don't keep the characters and no one on the server is very high level
and besides that they are all newbs like you. So its not a very fair
trial of the game. It might be enough to tell if you absolutely hate
it though.
