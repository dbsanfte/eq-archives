I am glad to see that you posted Don so that I can personally thank you 
very much for your efforts in maintaining that excellent faq. Even as an 
experienced player I found some interesting tidbits in there for myself. 
I also greatly appreciate the handy links to the class specific sites 
and some of the other sites as I am planning to play some other classes 
and I enjoy visiting such places. It's a very nice service you do for 
the EQ community and I am sure that like myself, many appreciate it very 
much.

By the way, I got my best friend of many years the EverQuest Platinum 
package for Christmas this year so as to rope him into Norrath, take 
away all of his once free time, end his marriage, etc. LOL!! So, I am 
sending him a link to the very nice Web version of the faq. It is just 
perfect for someone new to the game. Although I still think its very 
nice for everyone else as well.

So thanks very much and keep up the great work! :-)
