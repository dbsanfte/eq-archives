Heh. Any time we do HoT, if five or six MObs go by who drop nothing,
people start joking about adjusting the loot dial. We pull between
fifteen and twenty MObs in between pit spawns and they are usually
good for 2 or 3 drops on average.

I haven't seen plate dropping more often than other types of armor,
but it should. There are five plate classes versus 3 chain, 3 leather
(really 2 for most practical purposes,) and 4 silk.At the rate we're
going, we'll be selling MQs of everything else when we're still only
60% done with plate. (The next leather BP that drops will probably be
sold.)
