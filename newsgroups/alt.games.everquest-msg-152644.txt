Your best bet for good fps, GeForce4 ti4200 or better with 64MB+ DDRam,
1GHz+ processor of most any type, 512MB+ RDRam or DDRam.  Do not use a
windmodem, always use a hardware modem, or better yet, broadband of some
type.  Your current system likely does not have an AGP slot, so wait on a
new system before shelling out on a video card.  I ran EQ acceptably, pre
SoL with a 200MHz Pentium MMX, 64MB of SDRam, and a Voodoo3 with 16MB on a
24k winmodem connection.  I had major fps issues in forest areas in Kunark,
and in places like the EC tunnel (The old hangout for auctioners).
