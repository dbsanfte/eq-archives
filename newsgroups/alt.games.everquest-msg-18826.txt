so after being exposed to everquest, i began to believe it really did have
an ecomony . . .

BUT

where's the middle class?

i'll shut my damn mouth if its just that playing on an older server like
fennin (it is older, right?) has skewed me, but i'd love to know the answer
to "where's the middle class?" - even if the answer is crappy in my case as
only an answer relating to fennin will help . . .

i feel like everyone's well on their way to being hella uber *OR* a twink to
gasp at . . . where are the regular people?

i've got a few chars, and they're all in their teens - none have more than
200pp except one with a velium etched stone mace (which i'm told is worth a
few hundred plat)

where the bloodly hell are the other people who can't afford cool stuff?
c'mon, everyone's got a few kpp laying around for fancy +[a gabillion] [the
stat i really want] and +[15] [the stat i *yawn* might use]

some guy tried to sell me a +5 ac, int, sta, sv poi/dis for 3kp - wtf? okay,
it was range slot, but come on!? is supposed to be like that [and am i going
to be shouted at for not believing you?] . . . i don't know what a hero
bracer is, but people buy one everyday ! and it costs a lot! i'd settle for
a swatch on my char's wrist


i doubt its my place to start bitching on a newgroup, but i just want to
know why there aren't other wizards who ONLY own a gossamer robe and some
raw silk armor . . . ranger in banded? druid in that cheap heavy metal?
naked monks? dammit, i want rygorr and dragon or gator and god's loincloth
stuff -- or i really want to see other people like myself


so if anyone has a moment to help me out, can somebody explain the
following? i suppose its the question i'd ask after i hear what you people
think about a middle class . . .

if i have cheap armor, it's roughly 1pp per AC . . . so if the armor is
lighter, its a bunch more per AC  . . .  OKAY makes sense . . .

crapple in my snapple 1 = so if i'm buying a +5 STR earring, its worth X
plat (no big deal) . . .
    if i'm buying a +5 STR on a weapon that's about a weapon i should be
fighting with, the sum is hella high . . .
        slots are that important? what are their ranks? what slots should i
use for what stats? what's the efficient way to do this?

segment 2 = if i buy TWO +6wis earrings, they're not worth as much as ONE
+12 wis earring . . . that does make sense, but how do the numbers run for
this case?

part 3= why aren't stats roughly equal? why isn't a +3dex ring worth as much
as a +3agi ring? sure int = wis . . . +cha is dirt, and +ac is splendid?
okay, but what about everything else? why so much variation (why is it
harder to buy stats for one char than it is for another?) just explain this
. . . anyone got some ideas on what ranks highest?

finally (4) = what i consider the most important question , what is the
closest approximation for COMBINING stats? DONT say there isn't one, because
somebody has to be working these things out --> if +stat1 item and +stat2
item both cost +/- 10-15% of each other, then why is +stat1 &+stat2 item
worth SOOO much more( 30-40%)? do +str +dex combos jack the price up by more
than +sta +dex or something like that? what combos can i afford for my pure
caster, and ditto for my monk? and, moving right along, what happens when we
get 3 stats in the mix? what's usual to expect when you've got 3 related
stats? what's the "formula" for 3 unrelated stats? this is that whole slot
thing, isn't it?

thanks in advance

i'm willing to pay money in real life for some kpp on fennin,
adam diero
