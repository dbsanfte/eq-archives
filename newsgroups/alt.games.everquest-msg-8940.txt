As it is, the guild I was in(same server different character), folded,
reasons unknown, I was taking time of for RL, come back and no tag,  ask
around on the server board, guild folded, but I can get into another
guild that absorbed a good percentage of the member just by asking....
I'm thinking I just might.   I miss that pale green chatter.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
