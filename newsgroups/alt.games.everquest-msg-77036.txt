Hmmm, any druids want to test it out?  Wish I had known this 10 levels ago 
when running through SG was actually a risky venture.  Can't believe how 
many times I died to those damn seahorses from 49-56ish.  
I have fostered a healthy hatred of those bastards, but I learned to love 
SG.  I think my best EQ pickup day ever was killing seahorses, and 
everything else we could find, in SG.  (Had camped outside SG after DN 
raid, logged on to see a shammy I sort of knew, we started as a duo, 
eventually grew to 5 people, dropped I think 8 cloaks (had to log on 
twinks to loot them), several bracers, and enough fishing poles that we 
were running really, really low level twinks out to loot them.
