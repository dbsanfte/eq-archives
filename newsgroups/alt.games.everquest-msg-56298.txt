having horrible luck with my newsserver today.  Wish I could currently
afford to switch to web based newsserver.  If anyone knows of a FREE
server that carries alt groups like this one in particular, EMAIL me
with it as i am losing posts like crazy.  That said I would recommend
for your level a Flayed skin cap.  It has a dark pink/Maroonish leather
graphic on my erudite necro.

AC8 4 str, 4int -2 charisma Human/Erudite Necro/SK only.
