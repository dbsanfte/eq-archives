The baseline agreement states that each individual user needs their own
account and that individuals must not share an account. Lookig around
forums and newsgroups its pretty obvious that some people do share an
account though I have no idea how efficient Verant are at noticing.....
as a single household user of the game I've never had cause to find out.

The account isnt held on the computer but at Sony...once created you can
access the specific player account from any machine. Each machine can have 
the software installed, and access any of the accounts (though hotkey
settings need to be generated on each machine). Indeed you could set up on
one machine all of the accounts and then send the others of to their
machine to install software and then plug into their particular account.
Only one character from any and all the servers can be online at any time
so you canno for instance use 2 machines to play 2 of your characters
alongside each other at one time (IIRC)

No, the core EQ is required whatever, each of the individual expansions
can be added singly or together. Our guidl has a spread of people with
different sets of expansions.
