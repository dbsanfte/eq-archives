I mentioned this (and /bugged it several times) a couple of weeks ago.  Very
similiar situation, save that I'm a 28 necro attempting to fearkite Gnolls
in South Karana.  First or second time Fear hits, mobs vanish.  Damnably
annoying.  A ranger fearkiting in EW says that she used tracking to find her
poofed mobs; they were most of the way across the zone, in random places,
with the hate list cleared.
