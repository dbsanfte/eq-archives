All of the existing content, you can still get to with boats and/or
druid/wizard ports (well, not so much the boats, and yes I DO agree
they need to fix them) if you feel that PoP is a waste of money.  PoP
however, *is* new content.  Massive amounts of new content.  New
spells, new quests, new items, new planes.

And no, I'm not a Verant/Sony ass-kisser, I hate their decision to
make /raid a PoP only feature.  But again, you have boats, and feet.
If you don't want to pay for PoP, use them (and get Sony to fix the
!#@$# boats)
