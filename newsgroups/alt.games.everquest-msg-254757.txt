What death penalty  ? theres no exp loss, and, as I understand it, the item
loot penalty is leaving, or in the case of Tallon and Vallon, has been gone
for a long time.

The real problem with starting a newb on a Zek is dealing with the massive
twinks, while trying to level yourself up. And then, once you DO get
levelled up contending with the Ubers that have equipment from Time/GoD, and
100's of AA's.

No... PvP in EQ as its now implemented is far from a "Fun" thing.
