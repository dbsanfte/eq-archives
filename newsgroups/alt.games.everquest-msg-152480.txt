Its not a good idea to play haste just because you have it.  Until
very high levels, bard haste doesn't stack with cast haste.  Any
buff cast by a group member is probably better than anything you
can sing, not because it does more, but because the buff lasts
quite a while and doesn't take much maintainance, while you
are limited to about three songs at any given time.

If you don't have a haster in your group, and do have some
melee damage production, bard haste is great.   Even if
you do have a haste caster, bard haste can be a good option
if you have a melee heavy group and the haste caster is
having to struggle to keep haste on all the melee's, since
bard haste stays on the whole melee group.

The key to bard song choice for a group is to think
carefully about who is in your group and what they
are doing, and what you are fighting.  Bards can fill
almost any slot in a group, and boost the performance
of almost any group... but they have to do so
intelligently to get the most out of the rest of the group
members.

That said, the song combination I find most useful
in a group is snare/slow, haste, heal (juggling in
a primary hand strings instrument just on the
instant the heal song finishes casting) while meleeing
myself during fights, mana song or soothing between
fights (NOT working like a dog doing the optimal
soothing amp mana soothing mana mana soothing
mana mana cycle.. yes thats better but its very
wearing to stay that busy in between pulls)

When multiple pulls come in, I charm and/or
mez, and concentrate entirely on that, not
meleeing or hasting or anything of the sort.  I'm
sure better bards than I can keep up part of
the rest of their boosting, but I'm better doing
either boosting or crowd control and not trying
to mix the two. Luckily, my charmed pet is
contributing to the fight so this usually doesn't
slow things down too drastically... still, we
are better off with single pulls
