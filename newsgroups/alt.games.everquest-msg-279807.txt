/raises hand.

56th and 70AAs and going strong. 100% of my gear was looted from the 
mobs corpse after I helped killed it. 90% of my gear is no-drop.

So far in the bazaar the character has purchased: an essence emerald for 
the VT key quest, some imbued/enchanted items (e.g. imbued black 
pearls), and some foraged items. Oh and I hired a high level necro to 
convert meat to bone chips because I needed some 8000 of them for 
Greenmist faction.

While I've been hit by a few mgbs and a the very occasional random buff 
I've never solicited them.

/shrug That might be fun for someone to try. But if that's your plan you 
can forget about playing with *anybody* else. I don't care for that 
idea.
