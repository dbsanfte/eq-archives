While I'm here, does anybody know if they've reduced the frequency of
character saves?  As in 'Sebet saved'?  'Cos I set a few things last night,
client settings and such, and about half an hour later I got murdered (by a
BLUE, can you believe it - bloody bandit casters), when I turned up back in
Qeynos I had to redo the settings all over again.

I got curious, scrolled back through the message list and found one 'Sebet
saved' in the entire viewable bit of the log.  Seemed odd.

Ooo, and can you save manually?
