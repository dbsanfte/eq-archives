The person does not learn how to play their character.  They might have 
one weapon skill at a reasonable level, their defensive skills may be in 
decent shape, a lot really depends ont he PLing method in particular.  
Their taunt is probably not in good shape, the liklihood of a taunt 
working on a red mob is not all that high, and thus, probably not 
bothered with.  Taunting the mobs is not even all that important during 
PLing, it doesn't matter if the mobs are hitting the PLer, just that the 
PLee does his point of damage, and a DS does the rest, if that is the 
PLing method being used.  Another way is to almost kill a mob, then make 
it forget, and let the PLee finish it off.  Another method is to root a 
mob, stand next to it, and have the PLee kill it while the mob is vainly 
beating on you.  Another method is to group with someone who is at the 
maximum level that can group with you, and have him do all the work, and 
you soak up the xp from the red to you mobs.
