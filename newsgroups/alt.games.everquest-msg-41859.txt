Also, if it's only that particular user that's having issues, it most likely
is closer to their ISP, and therefore their ISP may be able to track it down.
Even if it isn't their fault.  On the other hand, when a large percent of
people are affected, even if it isn't Verant's direct problem they can
potentially track down the problem and notify the correct people.  Which I've
also seen them do.

I think people are taking comments like "Check with your ISP" as meaning "It's
your ISP!"  Just like they take statements from Absor or Abashi such as "We
don't have plans for rideable horses" as meaning "We swear on a stack of
bibles that we will NEVER EVER EVER have horses, and we mean it!!"
