In my short rogue life I have come to love the class and wish it to be LEFT
ALONE. Orlun has described the class beautifully and if there are any
changes done to the class, I think most of us only want poisons to become
more useful. Anything else is just silly. We are a well rounded class that
can exist quite hardily when left to our own devices.

We are in great demand and are generally a great "Swiss army knife" with
quite a few little gadgets that make some trivial task easier. The main
blade however is a big can of whoop-ass.

Twink rogues feel jilted; true rogues realize their potential. There is no
other class I'd rather be: we our powerful in our stealth, deadly with
deception.

Cheers

| I have been playing a rogue since a while now and although it is a
| great class, I find that many of his skills are totally useless.
| Mainly disarm traps and pick locks. They really should add more locked
| doors in the game.

| The skill I am missing most of all however is the tracking skill. The
| way I see the rogue, especially in PvP servers, is as a bounty
| hunter/assisin. It would be great if they could track down their
| victims with the tracking skill. I personally still don't understand
| why a bard would get the tracking skill, he is a musician! I would
| find it much more making sense if the rogue would get that skill.
|
| Verant has been massively upgrading the casters. With the new pet
| rules I surprise that not everyone is a necro or mage yet. But it
| seems to me that Verant is forgetting to balance the non-magic classes
| as they are "balancing" the casters upwards.
|
| Are there any Verant-officials in this group, I would like to hear
| their responce.
