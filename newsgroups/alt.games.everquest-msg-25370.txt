Your claims, unlike mine, are solely based on conjecture.  The beef I
had, I wrote about from the heart, and from my own experience.  I
accused those who spend the majority of the day playing everquest
pathetic. I feel bad about that, mainly because some of you responded
as though offended.  I apologize.  But really, look at the nitty
gritty... how good is playing Everquest 10 hrs a day?
 I'm not about to get into an argument about the type of person I
am... as I stated several times in this thread, I regret some of the
comments I made, but that doesn't make my experience any less correct
or real(within my own sphere of experience).  If you honestly think
that the best way to spend your life is by doing what you're doing,
best wishes, enjoy.  I think The Simpsons quoted it best:  Comic book
store guy: "oh my god I've wasted my life."

Jesus christ!!!! I think I hit a nerve with you... are you perhaps
self-conscious about something?
