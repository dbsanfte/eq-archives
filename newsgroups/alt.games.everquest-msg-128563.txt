<If I have for example 2 polished bone bracelets with affliction efficiency
I on them, when the effect is used is it twice as powerful or something?
Also
<if I replace one of the bracelets with a chipped bone bracelet with
affliction efficiency II would both effects work together or only the higher
one?

If you have 2 focus items of the same type only one will activate. If you
have one with afflicion efficiency II it will work on higher lvl dots. While
the Afflicion efficiency will work on the lower dots. I just figured this
out with my cleric who had 2 improved healing I and one Improved Healing II.
The IH I only worked on heals up to the spell heal, but the IH II only
worked on Gheal and Sup heal. Hope this helps 8 )
