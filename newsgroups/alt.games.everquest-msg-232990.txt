> *** THE LIST OF NAMES IS AT THE END OF THIS ARTICLE. ***

> OK, Read this carefully. Get a printout of this information,
> if you like, so you can easily refer to it as often as needed.
>
> INSTRUCTIONS:
>
> 1. Take a sheet of paper and write on it the following:
> "Please add my name to your list". This creates a service out
> of this money making system and thus making it completely legal.
> You are not just randomly sending a dollar to someone, you are
> paying one dollar for a legitimate service. Make sure you
> include your name and address. I assure you that, again, this
> is completely legal! For a neat little twist, also write what
> slot their name was in: "You were in slot 3", Just to add a
> little fun! This is all about having fun and making money at
> the same time!
>
> 2. Now fold this sheet of paper around a dollar bill ,(no
> checks or money orders), and put them into an envelope and send
> it on its way to the five people listed. The folding of the
> paper around the bill will insure its arrival to its recipient.
> THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT!!
>
> 3. Now listen carefully, here's where you get YOUR MONEY COMING
> TO YOUR MAILBOX. Look at the list of five people; remove the
> first name from position one and move everyone on the list up
> slot one on the list. Position 2 name will now move to the
> position 1 slot , position 3 will now become position 2, 4 will
> be be 3, 5 wil be 4. Now put your name, address, zipcode AND
> COUNTRY in position 5, the bottom position on the list.
>
> 4. Now upload this updated file to as many newsgroups and local
> bulletin boards' message areas & file section as possible. Give
> a catchy description of the file so it gets noticed!! Such as:
> "NEED FAST CASH?, HERE IT IS!" or "NEED CASH TO PAY OFF
> YOUR DEBTS??", etc. And the more uploads, the more money you
> will make, and of course, the more money the others on the list will
> make too. LET'S ALL TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER BY BEING
> HONEST AND BY PUTTING FORTH 120 PERCENT INTO THIS PROFITABLE & AMAZING
> SYSTEM!!! You'll reap the benefits, believe me!!!
> Set a goal for the number of total uploads you'll post, such as
> 15-20 postings or more! Always have a goal in mind!!! If you can UUE
> encode the file when uploading, that will make it easier for the
> people to receive it and have it downloaded to their hard drive.
> That way they get a copy of the article right on their computer
> without hassles of viewing and then saving the article from the File menu.
> Don't alter the file type, leave it as an MS-DOS Text file. The
> best test is to be able to view this file using Microsoft's
> Notepad for Windows 3.x or WordPad for Windows '95. If the margins
> look right without making the screen slide left or right when at
> the ends of the sentences, you're in business!
>
> 5. If you need help uploading, simply ask the sysop of the BBS,
> or "POST" a message on a newsgroup asking how to post a file,
> tell them who your Internet provider is and PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS BE
> GLAD TO HELP. I would try to describe how to do it but there are
> simply too many internet software packages with slightly different
> yet relatively simple ways to post or upload a file. Just ask for
> help or look in the help section for 'posting'. I do know that for
> GNN, you simply select 'POST' then enter a catchy description
> under the subject box, choose 'ATTACH', selecting 'UUE' and NOT
> 'TXT', then choose 'Browse' to go look for the file. Find your
> text file CASH.TXT and click on it and choose 'OK'. Place a one
> line statement in the main body section of the message post
> screen. Something like "Download this to read how to get cash
> arriving in your mailbox with no paybacks!" or whatever. Just make
> sure it represents its true feasibility, NOT something like...
> "Get one million dollars flooding in your mailbox in two days!"
> You'll never get ANY responses!
>
> 6. And this is the step I like. JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY LIFE
> BECAUSE CASH IS ON ITS THE WAY!! Expect to see a little money
> start to trickle in around 2 weeks, but AT ABOUT WEEKS 3 & 4, THE
> MONEY STORM WILL HIT YOUR MAILBOX!! All you have to do is take it
> out of the mailbox and try not to scream too loud (outside anyway)
> when you realize YOU HIT THE BIG TIME AT LAST!!
>
> 7. So go PAY OFF YOUR BILLS AND DEBTS and then get that something
> special you always wanted or buy that special person in your life
> (or the one you want in your life) a gift they'll never forget.
> ENJOY LIFE!
>
> 8. Now when you get low on this money supply, simply re-activate
> this file again; Reposting it in the old places where you
> originally posted and possibly some new places you now know of.
> Don't ever lose this file, always keep a copy at your reach for
> when you ever need cash. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TOOL THAT YOU
> CAN ALWAYS RE-USE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN CASH IS
> NEEDED!
>
> 9. (This step added by Ender). Hello, This is exciting
> isn't it?! While I'm on the list, just add a note saying "Please
> include extra money tips" with your name & E-MAIL address, and I
> will (FOR FREE) send you some neat methods to increase the money
> you will receive with this plan. Why?... Why not? I'm not a selfish
> jerk...I like helping out others. E-mail just makes it a touch
> easier and cheaper, too! After I drop off the list, I can no
> longer offer you this advice, obviously, but maybe someone else
> who gets my tips will offer and simply replace my name on this step
> number 9. Good luck and give this plan your all, it will definitely
> pay off! Like Mike said, HAVE FUN WITH IT!!!
