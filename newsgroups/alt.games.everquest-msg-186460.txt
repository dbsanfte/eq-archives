Look at the sentence structure.  The 'everyone else' is all those who would
choose not to worship at the monolith.  My beliefs are not mentioned
anywhere, unless you assume that I wouldn't be doing much worshipping at
your monolith.

That's what happens when us po' ol' dumb casual players pay the same amount
to play as you really smart whiz-bang players do.

Then set up a hardcore gamer tier where you pay a higher monthly fee to
accomodate your increased usage, strip everything down to the way it was in
beta, and go back to looking at your spellbook, Snare and Root not stacking,
and dots not taking full effect if the mob is moving.  You see, for your
'dumbing down' argument to work, everything that's not a straight bug fix is
dumbing down the game.  You can't afford yourself the luxary of picking and
choosing what's dumbing down and what's not.  Any change that makes the game
easier than it was before is, in essence, a dumbing down of the game by that
standard.

No PoK.  No Soulbinders.  Old UI.  No improvements other than new zones.

Have fun!  Should be lots of great hunting spots open on that server .....

Battle?  When did it become a battle?  Crimony .. it's a game.  Get over
yourself.

I'm just going to have to agree to disagree with you here.  All this
genuflecting to your hardcore-gamer attitude is making my pants baggy in the
seat.
