Sort of.  Each time, your chances of spawning the AC _that time_ are the
same, but your cumulative odds are better.  If your chance of spawing the AC
in that spot are 1 in 10 (easy numbers to work with), then if you wait two
spawn cycles, your cumulative odds are 1-(.9^2), or 19%.  For three cycles,
it becomes 27%, and so on.  While your odds of spawning the AC on each
particular roll are still 10%.  By the seventh spawn cycle, your odds are
about 50/50.

I think it's more of the fact that you've broken the "camp" into smaller
parts which are less likely to have burned you out.  You were able to get
J-boots because you could tolerate to camp.

Which would be better, since only those who could use the J-boots would camp
them (well, them and their army, since I'm sure many would be twinks, still,
no MQ farmers).
