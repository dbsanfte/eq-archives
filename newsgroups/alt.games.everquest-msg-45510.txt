my understanding is that if you have like 3 items and then a bag, the 3
items will fill up first, then the bag will fill the 4th slot, if there is
one.  if not, it drops to the ground.
if you put items in a trade window and then put a bag, same thing could
happen even with trading I believe.  probably should test it to see if this
is the case.

I often times have someone give the plat to my main char and sell off on a
secondary char.  of course if they don't wanna do it, I often will let the
plat sit on the secondary char until i can find a good time and place to
transfer the PP to my main char.

problem is that this thing of my other char has the item but I want the plat
first is an old scammer trick, as is trying to move plat or items and person
who is helping do the transfer just walks off with it.

most likely you'll get caught scamming and get banned.  One instance I know
of the GM's didn't replace the scammed items off of someone.  They did ban
the people who did the scamming though.
