Personally I hadn't read anything at all about GoD, (although I don't like the
acronym now that I've seen it a few hundred times).  I had been downloading it
right along though, and my ranger had been to the Nedaria's Landing to scout
out the *lay of the land*.  I'm embarassed to say she also got quite dead in
the *other* new high level zone within minutes of going in - everything on
track was dark blue to me at 57 and there were a lot of dead bodies laying
around, guess I should have figured it out. (I was running to help someone who
was in trouble when I got agro, fwiw.  Luckily a cleric in the zone rezzed me
right away).
So I'm very confused about the *nerf* to the tribute system, (that was only in
effect for one day), because I don't know anything about it.  From what I'm
reading, it appears you could get mega *something* for doing almost nothing, am
I right?  
Everyone's already said you could turn in snake fangs and get mega *points* but
exactly what kind of points were they and what were they good for?
