It sounds like you don't have your card set up right for your res in
windows that you are running EQ in, specifically 640 x480 in some of
those initial screens while later on when the world is loading its the
640 x 480 screen inside your res you have EQ set at (with the black
border) if you have screen same size on (in your eq display once in
game)

So the first thing you should do is go to settings on your desktop and
switch to 640 x 480 and make sure your screen does not black then, if
it does wait a few seconds and it reverts. Then you need to go and
make your current res Adapter Default. After you make your resses
adapter default instead of the optimum you have them set for, the 640
x 480 will also be at adapter default when you try it again. 

I had this same problem on my TNT 16 meg agp card with the nvidia
drivers, which for some reason can have 800 x600 at 100 hz (which it
will be in EQ also) but needs 640 x 480 set at adapter default which
is like 60 hz (settings higher than that seem to black the screen..
odd) I don't really care because of course I'm usually playing in full
screen mode at the 800 x 600 100 hz.

Once you cycle through all possible resses at adapter default, THEN
you can change (one by one) the 800 x 600, 1024 x 768 or whatever res
you use your desktop at and EQ at to the hz you want and it will
remember that the problem ones which are blacking you (like perhaps
the 640 x480 ) are still set at adatper default.

The problem is that in installing the new card it reset the settings
or something, or they are left over from your old one. As the other
poster suggested the best thing to do might be to go to adapter and
select standard VGA, soft reboot, uninstall your current nvidia
drivers, get new ones you want from www.nvidia.com or wherever, THEN
install them and soft reboot, then nvidia drivers will freshly set up
your settings, THEN cycle through the resses making sure none black
out on your DESKTOP, and set some possibly to adapter default like 640
x480 if you having a problem. 

Yeah, it sounds like a lot to do but eventually it gets old had and
you get fast at it when you find you don't have to boot into safe mode
or even reboot, but can change the adapter to regular pci vga then
just soft reboot, uninstall nvid drivers, install nvid drivers, soft
reboot, go through possible resolutions, etc. Then get in EQ. 

See, whatever your desktop hz is set at for a particular res is also
what it will be at in EQ. This is at least what I think will fix your
blacking out problem, the squiggly thing I'm not sure about. You
should dl several driver sets at the same time.. I do and then put
them all in a folder called "nvidia drivers" then I can switch around
in the way I've detailed here. I found with my tnt 16 meg that the
newest ones now work the best for me and have Umbra working in EQ
which removes a lot of my graphics lag (especially when in hall ways
or rooms , or turned away from other players(especially during guild
raids) )
