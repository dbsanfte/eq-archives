I don't think its completely healer centric; I was thinking of it
originally in terms of healer mana, but it seems to apply just as
much for non healer casters; nukes and the wide array of
CC/buff/debuff spells all depend on mana regen rates. I do agree
that its caster centric though; there are groups and soloers who
don't rely on mana to do much of anything, and for them this
doesn't really apply as written.

But I think it does apply in a wildly distorted way, even then.

HP regen generally matters very little compared to mana regen,
but in groups which don't have access to effective mana based
healing or mana based damage or mana based slow/haste/DS etc,
then it leaps to the forefront... and I think takes on the same
role as the more general mana regen in my earlier thesis.

Solo Warrior, the most extreme case, will kill a mob and then
bind wounds up to 50%, repeat.  How many mobs can he chew thru in
an hour?  Only as many as he can bind back up from.  So how fast
he can bind his wounds becomes a key factor for him; its his
"regen" so to speak.

With a bard handy, HP regen potentially gets much better.  But
its still the deciding factor.  So rather than heal to full, and
fight there, its probably better to fight in the same range as
that soloing warrior; keep the warrior's HP under 50% so that in
between fights you can both healsong and bind wounds; with the
two of you binding this should be twice as fast, faster still
because of the constantly running song.

Was the ranger using heals in between fights?  Was the rate at
which she'd get your HP back up to where you wanted it faster
than the rate at which it would go there just using natural plus
song regen?  If you were relying on her heals even in between
fights, then you are back to at least partially mana regen
limited kill rate.

Aye, I tried to address that to some extent in discussing how
melee damage isn't regen based; basically its either turned on or
turned off, as though the melee were casters who are constantly
at FM; when not fighting their resource is going to waste.  So
its important to balance the best mana regen plan against one
that utilizes the non mana based resources as well as possible. 
But I was still looking at it from a mana based view there, not
taking into account that in some groups there's no mana regen to
worry about at all.

Again, I think HP regen ends up taking the place of mana regen
there.

Bards are often the exception to any rule you can come up with...
but there's a way to look at bards that comes at this from a
different angle.  We were talking in a different thread recently
about an idea to run semipermanent buffs that cost a chunk of
your mana pool as long as they are up.  Well, I brought up bards
as an example; while there's no mana use at all per se, each song
has a short duration and yet tend to be the sort that need to be
run constantly; its as though each song is 20% of your mana
"pool" (or 25% or 33%, depending on how good a twister you may
be)  committed to being gone as long as you need that effect.

This still doesn't seem to translate to anything resembling mana
or even HP regen, though, for a soloing bard; you can run 5 DOTs
and keep it up all day, killing mobs per hour without anything
resembling resource management, as long as you are perfect at not
getting hit at all.
