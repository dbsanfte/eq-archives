I counter your bs and call a full fledged Bullshit.

I think I said it last time we had this little discussion, but I'll
say it again:  If the druid was harder to level than any of the
characters (particularly the wizard, a class that suffers some of the
same preconceptions as druids and doesn't really come into their own
till almost the end game), then you are doing something ridiculously
wrong.

>The druid was by far the hardest to get a good group with. 

I say this is because of preconceptions about druids and has nothing
to do with their actual utility.

Monks are good soloers, and enchanters aren't bad, but druids can
trounce both for exp soloing.

Don't forget enchanters.  Granted, these are classes that specialize
in one thing, and thusly can't do others.  Druids specialize in
nothing and can do damned near ANYTHING, spell-wise.

And doesn't really lose any power from that point on.  I can still
kill shit exactly the same way I do now, at 52, that I did at 29.

Well, that's not even true, because at that time druid root was shit
that tended to break itself so Root&Rot wasn't even an option.  And
hey, I was still using a shitty 3 minute snare because Ensnare broke
randomly like root.  So it's now EASIER for me to kill exp mobs.

Of course, the whole thing here couldn't be that you formed your
opinion of what the Druid class should be early on, and now you're
just pissy because it's not what you want?
