The reason warriors are justifiably pissed is that we have encroached on
the -only- area they can operate in.  While paladins and SK's can solo (yes,
it may not be the best, but my Paladin has soloed 90% of her life, and that
includes the shitty LoIO years - and even then, I soloed half the time I was
there), warriors can tank in a group... and that's about it.  Now, they may
be the absolute best at taking damage, but it's not by much, anymore.  The
knight classes have been steadily growing in our tanking ability so that the
difference isn't quite as much as it should be anymore.

Does that mean we should nerf the knights?  Absolutely not, we're still far
behind the casters, but let's give the warriors some love.  There is really
only one thing they can do, so they deserve to do it significantly better
than anyone else.  And since a main tank that can't hold aggro is pretty
much useless, I'd say getting aggro is part of their job.  If they're not
the best at holding aggro, they're not the best tanks.
