Yes, I read that thread (thus the reference to 60 warrior and katta
guards).  And if you want to substitute "I believe what so-and-so
guesses" for "I made my best guess" go right ahead.  Even if you accept
the speculation posted there on the rather small dataset presented (and
there are arguments within that thread) the so-called "soft-cap" was
tested for a L60 Warrior with a couple of particular buffs fighting a
particular mob.  Since we don't have any direct information on how
"avoidance" (Defense skill, AGI, and perhaps other factors) and
"mitigation" (armor) affect actual combat resolution it would be quite
a leap to apply that claimed "soft-cap" to a Ranger (lower Defense
skill-cap), or a Monk (higher displayed ac boost from same Defense
skill), or to a named mob or a mob of substantially different level.
I suppose it's possible that a Katta guard has an attack equivalent to
a L65 boss mob, but I haven't seen any claim to that effect.
(Note, I chose "a bat" to provide an easily grasped example of the
level sensitivity of the "soft-cap", I've seen no difference between
the damage "a bat" does vs. ac300 or ac1000).
Finally, the folks asking about the cap seem to often be lo-fifties who
have not yet reached their final skill-cap, so it's relevant to point
out the level for which you are claiming the cap is valid.


So in the end, you are either guessing or choosing to believe somebody
else's guess.  In the case of the steel warriors thread you're accepting
the tester's three guesses that:  1) the Katta guards are a good test
mob, 2) his testing methods are sufficiently controlled, and 3) his
dataset is sufficiently large.  His conclusion may be correct, but as
far as I can see he hasn't actually proved it to be so.
