Unless you're me.  I was 54 for about a month, I've been 55 for about the
same, but I'd probably have made 56 by now if my modem hadn't developed
random disconnect issues about 2 yellow into 55 that only got fixed last
friday (and I was busy IRL all weekend), so I should make 56 this weekend or
next week (2 yellow to go).

Everyone says that 54 is bad, but I really didn't see that big of a problem
with it, everyone moans and gnashes their teeth about it because of the
numbers being so much higher, but the way I looked at it (which definitely
helped me through it) is that it was only going back through level 53 twice.

And just a note, I did maybe 3 quads in all of level 54, and they were
mostly insanity (bulthar have the agro list of a dry bone skelly, wtg noobs
that sit in the middle of my kiting area while I'm kiting and then complain
that they die) or seeing if I could do Othmir (I can, but pulling them blows
since I have to abuse harmony)
