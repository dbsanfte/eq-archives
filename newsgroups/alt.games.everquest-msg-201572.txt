Very. Wow. Very. I wish, in retrospect, that I hadn't made my first character a
ranger. Not that she wasn't fun, but I got really spoiled by tracking. It took
some effort on my part to adapt to other chars that don't have tracking.

Significantly, yes, but I think other tracking classes make up for it in other
ways. It's very nice, but not something I could live without.

Not very useful at those levels. Nice for pulling, but with the equipment you
list I don't think you'll be kiting. Pays to keep the skill up for later levels,
though.

I've only gotten my ranger into the low 30s IIRC (she was mostly abandoned), but
I haven't had much trouble at all soloing her. In fact, during the time post
monk nerf and pre monk semi-fix (not that I want to get started on that debate
again) she was better at soloing than my human monk, IMHO.
