What issue?...Some people with too much money or too little sense buying
something that doesn't exist from other people with too much spare time.

The only real issue is for SOE to do something about it if they are really
concerned about players using their game as a means of RL income.

Bigboy was just trolling, if you ask me. Either that or he was under the
impression he was competing with other players in EQ.

I have seen no adverse effects on the economy from plat sales outside of
game. The items you expect to be 100k+ are. Those that are no longer
consider "uber" fall in price. Cobby BP's no longer sell for 100k and
neither do CoF's (althose these have held their price better then the
Cobalt) economy is changing in the same way it always has, last months
models are always less than they were a month ago.
