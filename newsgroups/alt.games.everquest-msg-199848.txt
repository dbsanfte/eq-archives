	More in answer to the post's title:

	A PvP mud includes too many "distractions".

	I don't mind strict PvP games like Planetside, any more than I would
object to, say, an RTS.  (I play Warcraft III and Age of Mythology online
sometimes.  I suck, but I play them.)  You're there to shoot the other guys.
Nothing else.  I do mind having to deal with LoRd K3wLi0 PKing me when I'm out
farming trade skill supplies, or trying to build a city, or earn experience.
RPGs of any stripe are poor forums for competitive play.
