I was doing the two tailoring combines needed for the Froglok Shaman shield quest and hit
a possible bug.  By all accounts I have heard, a skinning knife is not supposed to
disappear on a successful combine (or unsuccessful for that matter).  However, on each of
these two, it totally vanished.  No trace in my inventory at all of the skinning knife.
First knife I got free, but the second one cost me to skill up enough to make one.  Kind
of annoying to have it go bye bye.  I do not know if this is a bug with just these two
combines seeing that it is a new quest, or if it happens on others as well.  I reported it
as a bug anyway.
