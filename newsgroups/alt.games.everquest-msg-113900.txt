Well, the fact you were in a human town, talking to a human guildmaster
should have been your first clue.

And you honestly should have been seeing a pattern .... new lowbie quests
appear in Neriak that are Dark Elf only and NO DROP. Then, new lowbie quests
appear in Rivervale that are Halfling only and NO DROP. Then, new lowbie
quests appear in Freeport .............

Given time, I'm sure these will appear in every starting town. I just wonder
why they weren't added to Qeynos and Surefall Glade at the same time.
