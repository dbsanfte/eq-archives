[I've missed the original post]

My group and I were camping the throne room in Crushbone, and I (being an
Enchanter) was in the back. Well, I backed up a little and fell out the
window, landed in the water, and had to swim to the nearest ladder, climb
out and run all the way back. Good thing my group was still alive, but all
the mez had broken. It was pretty comical though.
