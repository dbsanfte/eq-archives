... in EQ? None of my girls have a lot of cash. My main is a lvl 18 druid,
who *gives* away SOWs and buffs. She never asks for cash, and usually, no
one offers to compensate her. She kills wisps for the lightstones to get
cash when she needs it. My 2nd (alt) is a 13 mage, and she's always broke
too. (hmm, maybe this is a function of lvl), as is my 13 enchanter. I was
just curious as to whether there was a class that was more broke than
others, generally speaking.
