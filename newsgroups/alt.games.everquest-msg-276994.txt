Seems a lot of people were fooled by this hoax.  I heard almost 9,000
accounts were cancelled in just one hour. ><  That and the false
merger info has resulted in cancellation of almost 32,000 accounts
before 10 pm yesterday. (seriously?  Dunno but a GM said this in the
GM channel)

Because this joke was very costly to SoE, Allakhazam could be sued.

It is sad when people don't realize yesterday was April's Fools and
they don't read the entire damn info just to see it was a joke.  I
mean the merger was way too weird to be for real especially
considering SoE and Blizzard would never share the same state, let
alone the same game server.  The fee increase was also odd and
confusing and couldn't be for real either.  Even a phone bill were
easier to figure out than the alleged price increase. =P
