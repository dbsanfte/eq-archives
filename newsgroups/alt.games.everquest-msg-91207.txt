I play in the UK too, and switched from Drinal to Antonius Bayle when
it went on line.

Not everyone in the UK is of the same opinion as our original poster.

Here are a few thing I noticed about the first non-US Server:-

Actually, it tends to be about the busiest server (with the occational
exception of Karenas, I think). There are more US players, but there
are a much higher conentration of players on the one server. Regularly
there are 200 to 300 players in East Commonlands. I am sure its just a
matter of time before more servers appear.

I have actually noticed that unless Verant is doing a major patch,
this isn't necessarily the case anymore.

I have also noticed that there are a lot more very high level
characters in AB than Drinal.

I have also noticed that there are a lot less players willing to give
help and advice in AB, and groups are harder to find (good ones
anyway).

When I first started playing EQ I was fustrated by the fact that
servers would be brought down during what would be normal playing
hours in the UK, but the game isn't so adictive that I can not do
without a fix everyday.
