You think you worked hard for that equipment but at level 4 you have no
idea.  The way I (and those warriors) see it is at level 4 you don't have
enough stuff to worry about.  Just go back to killing your rats and bats and
by the time you hit level 5 you will have it all back.  There will be even
tougher lessons.  It's probably too late by now but what you could have done
is make a hotkey command /corpse and run through the camp hitting it over
and over.  You will die again but at least you will probably move the corpse
away from the camp far enough to come back and loot it.  But as I said, its
probably too late because low level corpses decay quickly because they don't
usually have enough loot to worry about.
