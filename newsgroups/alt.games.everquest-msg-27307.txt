Weird.  Shield on a monk?  The high level that twinked my first monk never
mentioned anything about a shield.  I remember being all beside himself
trying to round me up 2 fighting batons.  Heh, we got a steal on them for
800pp each - I think.

This might be a way to work up a one handed skill, or if you put the weapon
in the off hand...ugh, monks confuse me can ya tell?

This is solid advice I'm pretty sure.  I thought it was 16.

*looks puzzled*

At 10, and non-twinked, not a hell of a lot.  I didn't hear you mention
armor.  I know my high level buddy was adamant about getting me into a full
suit of raw silk armor - and got me some Wu's fighting gauntlets.  Once
again, twink gear.  In your case I'd imagine some good lightweight armor is
really important.

Mend.  Even if you don't need it, use it.  I think my friend had my putting
almost *every* practice point each level - into mend.  Did I mention work
mend?

> I currently use tiger claw besides my weapons.

The Tiger Claw ability?  Sweet isn't it?  I think at 10 I still used round
kick a bit, been awhile.

Now I'll shut up and see what a *real* monk says =)
