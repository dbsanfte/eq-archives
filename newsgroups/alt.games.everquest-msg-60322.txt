Not really. I tried one of the window EQ thingies once and on my
system I got about 1 frame per second. Putting it in a window slows
you down a ton. There is pretty much no way even on a very good top of
the market consumer pc that you could run TWO eqs in a window on the
same computer. 

Even if its possible the frame rate would be intolerable, about the
only thing you might be able to use that setup for would be emergency
safe switching of items or money to a twink without having to use a
third party. As far as regular playing though forget it.

One of them was called DX windows and is on the showeq site.
