Personally, I'm doing it for three reasons:

(1) I need to collect a LOT of trade supplies to get my fletching from
209 to 250. The process is ungodly tedious and I don't see any reason
to inflict it on others.

(2) The breakup of my guild has left me with a desire for some "me
time" with the game.

(3) I hate grouping pre-50. There are just too many stupid people who
know NOTHING about the game, but proclaim their prejudices loudly and
can usually get a half dozen morons to agree with them.
