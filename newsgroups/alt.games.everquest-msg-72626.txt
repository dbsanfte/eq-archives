Ok ..recently had a bit a look on what is there and who gets what
in Luclin. I've stumbled over Druids and Shamen. A simple example:

Druids get the Spirit of Eagle spell in luclin, a powerful buff
that gives you 4 things: See invis, Ultravision, levitation
and SoW. Now let's look at who gets what and at which level:

Druid		Shaman		
14		9		See Invis
14		14		Levitation
14		9		SoW
N/A		29		Ultravision

So, druids get a combo spell of spells, that they don't even
have (Ultravision) or the shaman gets earleir or as soon
as a druid. Pretty idiotic IMHO. Spirit of Eagle should
clearly be a shaman spell. This kind of sillyness can be
found quite often. IMHO Verant should really get a clue :)
Same goes for stuff like the Regen line: A druid gets a
powerful direct heal in the end (800+ something) and
a scarily powerful DD (Moonlight .. or similar .. 1000+
DD). Shamen get Torpor, which ehals more, but is in
general inferior (slows and is over time). They also don't
get the direct heal. Now druids are a bit of their own class,
while Shamen are more often referred to as a priest class.
So, either Shamen or Druids get the powerful direct heals
or Regen spells. Since regen is more of a Shaman thing (they
seem to get more over time spells .. like torpor etc), IMHO
they should take the last regen line (Regrowth and especially
group Rewgrowth) away from Druids ... or the other way round,
but which seems less logical to me. Am I the only one thinking
Shamen got majorly screwed?
