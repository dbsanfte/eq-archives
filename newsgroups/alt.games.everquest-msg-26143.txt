Maybe I'm missing something here, but ... so?  So he comes back with his 
level 60, and what?  Challenges me to a duel?  No thanks.  Refuses to let 
me into his guild?  I've got one already, thanks.  Doesn't group with me 
with his other chars?  Not a problem.

I actually near-assume lowbies have a high-level alt.  True newbies seem 
very few and far in between.  My usual test is to give the naked ones a 
piece of low-level armor.  If they equip it immediately, they're lowbies.  
If not, I've just given a twink/beggar a free piece of merchandise. :)  

Anyway, in his defense (well, sort of) he wasn't so much being a jerk as 
being... rather a numbskull, really.
