A DOT which can't be dispelled, but which can be killed with melee 
damage?  A DOT that will move to a new target if that target has 
attacked the caster while its alive?  A DOT that stops working if its 
target is mezzed?  A DOT which can be buffed?  (or did they stop that part?)

Its a pet.  A really really bad one in many ways, and a suicidal one, 
but its still a pet.
