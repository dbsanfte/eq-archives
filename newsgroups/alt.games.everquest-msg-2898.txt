One day I was hunting in Crushbone and when it finally came time for me to log
for the night, I put myself in that corner just in front of the zone line. I
got called away at the 5 second mark figured it was safe enough... When I came
back to my PC I was at the orc lift. There must have been a train just around
the corner when I left. No prob, I'll just go get my corpse. It wasn't there. I
got a bard to lead me and it turned out it was right in front of the castle.
Some safe point. :)
