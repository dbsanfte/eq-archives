When the vision insists on going with night blindness when clearly they
technology they use can't support it like EQ did, the vision is broken.
Same with the spell book. Insisting on retaining it because it was
unfeasible to program the fading away spell book they wanted, when they
admitted the spell book as implemented was a mistake is also a broken
vision. Same with boats. Nice idea in the vision, buggy as hell in
practice for over 4 years. Hopefully they will have learned when to
throw out things that don't work rather than forcing broken
implementations on people.
