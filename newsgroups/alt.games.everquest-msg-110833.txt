I tend to ignore the "on me" and "bags of stuff" auctions as you may get a
decent item every now and again, but it's just not worth the hassle and
running around. My pet peeve is people who try to sell who won't specify a
price.

Auctioneer:    "WTS Charred Guardian Sheild"

Moi:    "How much are you looking for"

Auctioneer:    "Make an offer"

Moi:    "I have no idea on prices"

Auctioneer:    "Just name a price"

Moi:    "Bye - have a nice day"

*2 minutes later*

Auctioneer:    "????"

*5minutes later*

Auctioneer:    "Well???"

Moi:    /ignore Auctioneer
