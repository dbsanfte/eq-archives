OK, I bought the only "research only" spell for level 16, but at 20 
there were two.  One was available in the bazaar at 25pp so I bought it, 
the other was not, but the pages for it were (three of one side, one of 
another... so not a lot of copies, considering its a common drop off 
level 20 to 25 mobs)

Paid 20pp each for the pages, thats for a -chance- at making the 
spell.   Then I went to freeport and had some fun finding the right 
book; the guy inside labled enchanter supplies was selling the magician 
book!  Finally managed to find a vendor outside the guild that was also 
labled enchanter supplies, who had the proper book.

Went back in, to the guildmaster, to dump training points into 
research.  First point got me to skill level 20, 5 more to 25, which is 
the cap for the skill.  So I still have 83 skill points to burn on 
whatever, since I get 5 points every level and the skill cap goes up 5 
points every level.

Put both halves of the page into the book, hit combine, and succeded, so 
now I have Color Shift, which is actually a fairly important spell, 
second PB AE Stun, one more and I have lock down capability.  Heck, even 
now with some discipline and a second chanter a group could lock down 
for AE slaughter, I'd love to get together a group and clear all of 
Crushbone or something for the fun of it.

Looking ahead,  it seems there are three or four researchable spells per 
level.  Level 24 has one spell that I think I can buy elsewhere and two 
that I'll have to buy or research(strip enchantment, tepid deeds), 29 
has three spells that should all be buyable and one that isn't 
(feedback), 34 all three seem to be research only (insipid weakness, 
radiant visage, mana sieve), 39 has four, either two or three research 
only (mind wipe for sure, Gravity Flux someone else has but might be 
research for them too), 44 has four, three of which will be research 
only (color skew, shiftless deeds, pillage enchantment) and 49 also has 
4 with 3 research only (Reoccurring amnesia, allure, Blanket of 
forgetfulness)

Bazaar availability and pricing on pages seems to be completely 
unpredictable, as befits a product that few will need, fewer will need 
more than one of, and most sell to vendors if they bother looting at 
all.  Certainly the fact that you can't tell a page for a rare and 
highly usable level 49 spell from a page for a level 16 spell you could 
easily buy off a vendor unless you have a chart in front of you might 
have something to do with the problem.  (actually, chanter pages have 
-some- information, the lower level spells come from Tasarins, 24-29 
spells from Velishouls, 34-39 from Salis, and 44-49 from Nitilims... but 
how many people know that?)
