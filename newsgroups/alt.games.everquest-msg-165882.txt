Whats wrong with a lil extra damage, even if the fight isn't close?

I mean its not like using a charge of something.

You innerflame in the last 1-20% and you get agro?   If i start a fight with
it then I can expect some unwanted agro, but that late in a fight it takes
something pretty special to steal agro, like say, 10 ensnares in a row

I even use my disc on stuff like vindi, I mean hey any chance at increasing
my ks percentage is surely a good thing
