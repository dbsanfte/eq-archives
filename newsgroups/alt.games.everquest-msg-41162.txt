Absolutely. I was unaware of how extensive it was and only queried its
relevance on this basis. Since then I've just sat through an hours's news and I
feel bad about being so flippant and as someone else commented 'insensitive'.
I apologise to anybody who was offended by my remark.
This is horrible, just horrible and my thoughts are with everybody directly
affected, by which I mean all citizens of the US who have to face having their
country attacked like this.
