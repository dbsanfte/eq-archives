I think, after having about over 20 thousand people reporting messed up
faction reporting, having it investigated by a server gm and then having an
MOTD posted within 2 days of people reporting it, officially stating the
fact they are aware of it at this time should be more than compensate the
paranoia factor, unless you completely lost it.

But wait... I forget...  We are dealing with a 90% consumer base that
doesn't RTFM, read the MOTD, or take the time to piece together the big
sign in front of them that says "Tickets sold at the Gym" when they come up
to the gate and ask, "Is this where we buy the tickets?"
