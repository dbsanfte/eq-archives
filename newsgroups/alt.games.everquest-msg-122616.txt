Hail,

I'm a level 20 Barbarian Beastlord (about 150 plats in bank) who plays on
Antonius Bayler server.

My best friend in EQ, a female monk level 22 will have her birthday on june
23 and I'd like to give her a present but I have absolutely no idea.

Any suggestion or anyone with good enough tradeskills to help me make a
great present for her ?
