And the difference in "facilitating" trade between two independent
parties and "facilitating" a trade between SOE and one independent
party is? 

Less sacasticly, I ask again, if there is any cost to facilitate the
trade, how will Sony pay for that cost? The only answers I can come up
with are:
1) make every subscriber's payment to play also cover the cost to
facilitate trades
2) charge a profitable price for facilitating trades, which
immediately makes them want to facilitate as many trades as possible
for max profits, and also tempts them to be one of the parties in the
trade or to manipulate drop rates so folks are more tempted to buy an
item than to camp for it.
