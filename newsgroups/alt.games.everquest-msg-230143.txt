At 30 I spent some time in HighHold Keep grouped, and did some soloing
in Timorous Deep with my Beastlord. Golra Island in TD is a great spot
up to level 34. Also Echo caverns (entering from the Shadowhaven
secret door) is a good spot. Needlites, and Boglings are good exp up
to 34. Once I hit 34 I spent the next 5 levels in Dawnshroud Peaks
(mushrooms) and Jagged Pine forest (cave basilisks). At 39 you get a
great pet and a pet haste spell.
