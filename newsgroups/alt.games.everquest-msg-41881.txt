You can forget the alchemy, and if you can solo a Rathe HG, then you're
damn good at 39 with no snare.  That said, your question number three
holds the most promise. There are some zones where good stuff drops on
occasion if you're willing to be patient, and since you said
"occasionally" I assume you are.
  First of all, are you a group oriented shammy or one of the solo ones.
If solo, can't help you. If you group regularly and have some similarly
leveled friends, I was recently in and area that might be of interest.
City of Mist, deep in the Emerald jungle. With a group at your level you
could work the entry courtyard and balconies. You'll see a variety of
mobs on random spawns, most all of which a good group of your level
could take. The nice thing about this zone is that most all of the loot
has been "randomized". In other words, the various "nice" items that can
drop there (not all, but many) can drop off *any* of the mobs in the
"easier" part of the zone. Of course, you won't get the epic drops from
the reavers, etc. off a plaguebone at the front lamp post, but lots of
other stuff will randomly drop on somewhat rare occasions.
  The most common ones are wraithbone hammers which can sell for up to a
couple hundred plat. I got a Kunjar there, which is supposed to be
fairly valuable. A few Master Wu's Trance Sticks dropped, one of which
we sold for 4500 plat and I heard that was a bargain. We didn't get a
green jade broadsword, sadly, but I hear they are highly sought after
and expensive. So, you may want to give that a try. Some nice loot falls
there.
  Another dungeon where you'd likely need far less help is Dalnir. I
still woulnd't try to solo it at your level, but with a little help you
could probably take and hold the goo rooms. When the lumpy goos spawn
they will eventually drop some very high priced monk weapons.
