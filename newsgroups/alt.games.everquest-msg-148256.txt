I'm not too sure but I hear you don't have to do the endless exp grind
thing to advance and have fun. Maybe you need to for level raising but
I hear you can stay in towns and do trade skills and other things that
don't require fighting over and over like everything in EQ does. I
myself am going to try this game for like a month after I get my new
p4 2.4ghz. The main reason being because I can since my new computer
will rock :p but there are a lot of MMORPGs coming out and I want to
get in on one that will actually be very very fun and entertaining
instead of endless hours of exp gaining, and group searching if you're
a wizard. Still verant says they're making gameplay changes to not
make exp so damn long and boring with PoP so maybe they will win out
in the end. I know they rarely do what they say they will but will all
the nifty new changes they gave wizards and casters after they said
they were going to I've given them the benefit of the doubt on this
one.
