It's always been my understanding that corporations like Sony like to
keep their various divisions self sufficient unless there was a
compelling economic reason to do otherwise.  Thus, they're not going
to take money away from their digital camera operation and pour it
into their Online Entertainment operation.

I'd be willing to bet that Sony Online Entertainment has a pretty
strict budget that prevents them from funding some operations as much
as they'd like to, like the money and manpower to enforce this rule. 
That's only going to change if Everquest itself starts making more
money, since it's likely that they're not even intermingling funds
from their other online entertainment ventures.

It's a pretty standard practice among corporations, otherwise someone
like Sony could lose a staggering amount each year to inefficiency.
