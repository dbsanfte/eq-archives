Ok.  Thanks for the minor correction.  The point in the post was to give a
suggestion for the best two person team in the game.  A Shaman and Warrior
team can easily go all the way to the low 50s without ever having to group
with anyone else.  A Ranger/Druid team will start having problems in their
mid 30s and up due to the Druid's lack of big heal spells.  Like a Druid a
Shaman does not get too big of heal spells but that Canabalize Spell that
they get to trade their Health for Mana is really sweet.  It makes up for
the heal spells' shortcomings.

A Shaman friend of mine teamed up with me one night in OverThere.  He was
level 40 and I was level 38.  I pulled stuff for a solid 45 minutes without
having to have any down time for the Shaman to med back up.  And that was
done without any Enchanter buffs on him.  Then after about two minutes wait
we were at it again.
