You don't need an iceland key to port to iceland. But you need a GD/WL/CS key to
be ported to the GD/WL/CS rings. However, once you got the CS ring key (not the
key that helps you enter Cobal Scar, but the ring port key), you don't need the
GD/WL port key any more. 

BTW, for porting to CS, you better have invis on. There are some drakes casting
nasty AE ice DD surronding the ring. They don't see invis tho. For WL, well,
that's Wuoshi's spawn point. Better make sure it's not up if you need a ride to
there, unless of course, you are on dragon faction. )
