*shrug*  Maybe we were just unlucky with the procs, but it seemed like he did
it more than once every 30 seconds.    As for having another warrior ready to
step up, remember we're talking about Kunark here.  The days of AE taunt,
bellow and throwing on your hate augmented BoC weren't even a dream.   With
the weapons available then, aggro control isn't nearly as easy as today.

52 raiding Vox and Naggy may or may not be a good guide, but level 65 - 70 vs
Kunark dragons definitely isn't.    Just the levels alone would severely limit
the effectiveness of fear.    Also, back in the Kunark days, fear worked a bit
differently. Nowadays, once you're over level 55, it's just a long duration
stun.   It doesn't send you running across half the zone anymore, which could
easily drive you out of healing range.

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
