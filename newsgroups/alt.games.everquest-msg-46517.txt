I've had several characters go hunt snow bunnies from 3rd to 5th
(well, in one case to 6th, but thats just pig headed) and would
think that with a group you could take one down at 2nd.  I know,
you are thinking TWINK which would be difficult to do at this point
in FV history, but quite the contrary, those characters have never
had anything valuable on them since I know full well that gear
will be unrecoverable, don't give em stuff till they hit 6th.
