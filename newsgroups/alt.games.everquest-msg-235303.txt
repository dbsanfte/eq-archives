It's possible.  But It could just mean he's rather intense all the time.  
Like the opposite of acute.  If his last name was Blunt, I'd ding him, 
sure.  But just Blunt or Chronic, I'd have to leave alone.  And Marijane 
is my aunt's name...  You can imagine how tired she gets of people trying 
to smoke her. :)  

I don't know for sure what the most common usage of 'chronic' among -all- 
gamers these days is.  If you're right, and that -is- what the character 
intended, odds are high enough that they'll do something else asinine and 
petitionable, so ya might as well wait 10 minutes and ding them for that 
instead. :)  But a character named -just- Chronic, or possibly say, an 
ogre named 'Chronic Halitosis', I'd be inclined to leave alone.  Despite 
the phrase rule. :)
