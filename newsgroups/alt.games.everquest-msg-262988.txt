The puller naturally has an advantage on the hate list; he's there first 
and seems to get a bump up for being the original thing to be annoying.

All things being equal, if you pull a mob and bring it in to fight, and 
someone joins you killing it, you should assume you are going to keep 
aggro unless something is done to change that situation.

One obvious thing a monk can do to shed this aggro is to FD; if you 
reset your aggro to zero then the other guy has a good chance to get on 
top of things.  Sadly, this stops working so well when you get mobs that 
don't reset aggro till they get back to their spawn spots.  Still, 
letting the MT beat on the mob a bit and activate his various aggro 
getting tricks should help; its just that doing so costs the group some 
of your DPS.

Thats a pretty twinky weapon at your level, and if the SK isn't equally 
well geared then he's going to have to work to overcome your lead

This is a really telling point.  Your only change was to switch to 
relatively crappy weapons, and he started getting aggro.  But he's only 
getting aggro midway thru the fight.  Once he has it, he holds it.

So... he's not using high aggro spells, or he'd be grabbing aggro early 
on and holding it.  And he's not using taunt, because if he was he'd get 
aggro for brief amounts of time and then lose it again due to your 
higher aggro output.  Its just weapons accumulating aggro over time and 
eventually overcoming your small lead due to having pulled.

Another possibility would be that he's using a proccing weapon to get 
aggro, and thus it often takes a while before the thing goes off.  But 
then it wouldn't be so consistantly the middle of a fight before this 
happens, sometimes it would be at the beginning, sometimes at the end.

Yeah, thats a lot of aggro compared to someone with a level appropriate 
weapon and no haste at all (which is likely the case)

On the other hand, the SK should have been able to overcome this by use 
of low mana high aggro spells; using his own snare instead of the 
druid's would have helped some but shouldn't have been crucial.  If it 
was a warrior you'd been working with I'd have more sympathy for him. 
Sadly his best aggro spell won't be available till over 55 on most mobs; 
fear, when the mobs are immune to it, is an insanely good aggro 
producer.  When they aren't immune, it can create bigger messes than it 
solves, of course.

On the gripping hand, if you didn't want aggro you should have shed it 
with FD, or at least tried doing so; the DPS classes mostly get tools to 
help them not get hit when they don't want to, and its part of your job 
to use them as appropriate.
