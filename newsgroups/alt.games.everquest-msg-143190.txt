/agree

I would not be at all surprised if every epic had some final bits at the
end with a level requirement, but the early ones are often doable at
lower levels. (As they should be, IMHO, if these are truly "epic" quests
designed to be done over the span of the character's "life".) For the
warrior epic, I did quite a few of the low level steps (e.g. one of the
hilts, and some other NPC intereaction and trades) when I was still in
the low forties. I didnt' start the wizard epic until 51 for unrelated
reasons, so I don't know about that one.
