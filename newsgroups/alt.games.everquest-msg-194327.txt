I haven't checked the numbers, but let's say you're right.  How does this 
mess up the game design?  Was the game designed such that the one with the 
highest single nuke ... wins?

Last I checked, Druids don't have a concussion type spell.  How are they 
going to keep up DPS without getting whacked?

What if a wizard crits?  Does that not count as the "biggest" nuke?

What about the wizard line of nukes that lowers resist checks?
