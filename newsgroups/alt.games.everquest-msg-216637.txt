Well, if you get them I would put them in this order:
- Detect Trap
- Remove Trap
- Unlock
since unlocking is useless if the trap is still there (the trap triggers
and the container remains locked) and you don't want to cast the Remove
Trap spell if you're unsure that the trap type matches what you can manage
(presumable cursed or magic).

However, the high-end component for the remove trap spell costs 17 plat
and a lot of chests will only yield one item worth eleven plat. Sometimes
you will get better (occasionally a gem or an aug) but you can bet a
pickup group won't be paying you for the component.

Personally I did buy the spells but sort of regret having done so. If they
could be used for *any* chest I'd be more optimistic but since they're
good for about one in three chests at most I'd suggest you not bother.

However, in general - do not try to open chests until you have finished
your mission objective. Failing your mission because a chest trap went
off and netted you an item worth less than what you paid to get it is...
not smart.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
