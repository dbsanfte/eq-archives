That's the thing, it seems to be real hit and miss now.  So far, the 
mages I have talked to that have tried it and failed have all said they 
did everything the way they are supposed to do it.  One had the 58 fire 
pet, and it was affected, one had the 49 pet, it was affected, one had 
epic pet, and it was affected, but, we actually would have won that one, 
but for poor positioning.  In all cases, the mage had his FR well below 
100 before summoning the pet.
