No, it of course bother me if anyone KS me or destroy a quest for me, or 
course happened with americans too. What bothers me are that some people 
lie to me and use the language as an excuse to KS or destroy quest for 
others.
Im danish myself, my primary language isnt english. That dont mean i can 
go KS everyone and claim i dont understand.
For example theres a guild on my sever composed of primary swedish 
people (would be great for me, play in same time zone, but dont wanna be 
a part of it, too bad reputation), have seen them do a lot of KSing, 
ninja looting and so on, but i have NEVER seen anyone from them claim 
that they cant speak english, and try to use that to get out of trouble.
