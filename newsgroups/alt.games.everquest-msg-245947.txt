You cant use HQ CATpelts for making handmade backpacks.

The cats in Stonebrunt commonly drop even 2 pelts and never
a ruined,you can forage bamboo shoots while hunting there,
some very rewarding quests too and the scenery is beautiful.
I took most of my alts through the levels 30 to 40 there.

All nice and that,problem is to get the spiderling silks for the 
paddings,drop rate on spiderling silk is awful in Feerott,FoB,
Gfay etc,especially since the newbie quests were introduced
in Feerott.
Point about Shadeweaver is that *BOTH* components for
paddings drop there in abundance,not to speak of the
swirling shadows.

Note thats from the viewpoint of a 65 Hunter,I simply stand
in the middle of the zone and press key 1(nearest target) and
2(Ranged attack),99% of the mobs die after one shot,no
fumbling with track.Doing this I sometimes see only lesser
shades and all kinds of hoppers on track,no annoying
placeholders.  :)
Uhh yeah ,I am a bad powergaming Farmer.  ;)
