I agree.  Not everything, but never a downer.  :)

Being stupid and careless has nothing to do with the pace of fights.  Oh
sure, it can affect the pace of fights, but I know plenty of people who will
be stupid and careless on a single pull (and then complain that the pace is
too fast to boot).

I sound like a monk that causes wipeouts?  Hardly, I'm just a monk that
doesn't have any desire to sit around and wait for you to be full mana when
I know that 20% mana is perfectly adequate for the next 4 or 5 mobs I'll be
bringing in quick succession.

Some people never want to play without a net.  Some people realize that's
the only way to play.  :)  Don't make mistakes and you won't be so worried
about having a reserve of mana to handle mistakes.

Monks don't pull because they can get smaller pulls than everyone else. 
Please...  ever hear of pacify?

Monks pull because they get a second chance if they don't get it right on
the first try.
