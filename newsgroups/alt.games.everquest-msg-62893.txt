I have had pretty fortunate luck.  I am running a PoS system i cannot
afford to upgrade (seriously cash strapped).

AMD K6-2 266
192 mb of ram
Voodoo Banshee video card, using a User Created DX8 driver
DX8.0a

Log in to Test server and got a black screen no buttons nothing, had to
reboot.
found a tip here about the UseTnL=FALSE line for the defaults section of
the eqclient.ini file.  Add that, and i get buttons etc.  Log in, and
seem to be doing okay, actually improved performance in Kunark.  I was
able to turn on the sky and the clipping plane up for the first time
since Kunark came out, at the FV bank with no slow down.  Granted there
were only about 20 others there at the time, but i have been 1 of 3
people at a fpm type of video hit in the past.

I am happy so far with the dx8.dll, not sure about others, but if it's
an improvement like this, i will be happy.  I don't like the new models
anyways, so being subspec and unable to display them is no skin off my
teeth.
