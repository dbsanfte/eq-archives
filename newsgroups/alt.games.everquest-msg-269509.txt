I don't think anything would change. I'm a pretty gregarious person by 
nature and always gravitate toward people. Over the years I've learned what 
to look for in other gamers to find that kindred spirit, and I've never had 
trouble finding groups. If your question is whether EQ2 makes it more 
difficult than other games, I don't think so. In fact, I believe the 
archetype system promotes greater opportunities for grouping than anything 
SOE's ever done before.
