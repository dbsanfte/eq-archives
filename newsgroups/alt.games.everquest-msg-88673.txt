Try to see if you can get a high level char in there, or in WC to help 
you get the corpse.

Your corpse are in the lowest level of befallen, and you WILL need all 3 
keys to get it. The first key are obtained from the DE in the top floor, 
the next ones are from the 3nd floor.
If you can get a high level to help, it shouldnt be a problem at all. If 
all keymobs are up, it take 5 min to get to the corpse, and a few min to 
drag it back up again.
High level people can walk freely around in Befallen, my 52 druid have 
been able to for some time. Only attacking mobs are the Willowhisps, and 
only if you sit down near them.
So find a high level player (if a high level rogue, its even better, he 
can pick the locks, no need for keys) in WC or befallen, and ask 
politely for help, and youll most likely get it.
