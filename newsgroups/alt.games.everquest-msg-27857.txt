Christ, you're dense.

Active subscribers means nothing to your argument.

All that matters to your argument are the people playing right *now*.
As of this moment, there are more high end (50-60) players than any
other level range... and by a wide margin.  This tells us that there
are a great many people, possibly a sizable majority, who have seen
the high level content.  Remember, your argument was that there were
not a lot of "uber" players compared to lower level, "casual" players.

And keep in mind, a great big chunk of those 1-50 players are alts of
people who have allready seen the endgame.

Hell, it's entirely possible that the majority of the active
subscribers have seen the post 50 game in some fashion.  I know I
have, with my own 49 wizard.  And at most every raid I've been to,
there have been quite a few mid to lower 40's players present.  Either
they are friends along for the ride, people learning the ropes of raid
content, or are needed classes even at such low level. (it should be
noted that at the high level content, even a low-40's cleric with CH
will be a more effective healer than level 60 shamans and Druids
against Magic Resitant mobs).

Offhand, I'd say your argument that most "casual"players will never
see the high-level post50 content holds about as much water as a
swiss-cheese sieve.
