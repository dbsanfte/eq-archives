Buy lots of HP gear for the cleric.

Get a KEI for yourself and a Temperance for the cleric.

Now go find mobs that are roughly yellow to the cleric  which don't 
run.  Cast COE on him.  Then he hits a mob until it does damage, then 
ignores it and goes to find another to pull.  Each time he manages to do 
a point of damage to a mob he then stops worrying about it and moves to 
the next.  Mobs will kill themselves on his DS.  All you have to do is 
keep him healed... and with roughly 100 times the HP on him he's 
"supposed" to have  you wont' have to worry much about missing timing on 
a heal.  Gheal (you don't have Sheal do you?) should be a very workable 
heal  for quite some time, and with KEI you shouldn't run into trouble 
keeping up mana to keep him alive.

The key elements of this strategy are 1) Cleric must do at least one 
point damage to get credit for the kill.  2) DS does the real killing, 
cleric's damage output (except for that one point) is largly 
irrelevant.  3) Mobs that don't run are better because they will 
completely kill themselves on the DS.  4) You can't do any damage at all 
using this plan.. because the damage done by the DS is "unattributed" 
which means you have to avoid outdamaging the paltry damage the cleric 
is actually doing; it will be appallingly easy to do this by mistake.

IF you have any other DS that stacks with COE use that too.  COE is 
great because it lasts forever, but if you are actively PLing, you 
should be able to keep up short duration DS pretty easy.  The more DS, 
the faster the mobs die, and thus the faster your cleric levels up.

If you have any decent duration regen you may be able to get thru the 
first 20 levels or so using this plan without having to heal at all, 
just keep the regen on.

An alternative is for you to pull mobs via a no damage method and then 
let them damage themselves nibbling away at you, and the cleric can pick 
off the nearly dead ones by hitting them... the danger here is that its 
easier to lose mobs this way as they kill themselves on your DS without 
the cleric ever having managed to put his point of damage in.  On the 
other hand, if you have self only DS and regen spells it may be faster 
killing.... only trouble is that with your AC the mobs may have a hard 
time landing blows and so end up taking less DS damage per minute than 
they would hitting a merely COE'd cleric near their level.  Also, as a 
hybrid (melee have the same trouble) you'll end up doing damage to mobs 
via Riposte unless you take care to equip a pair of opal encrusted 
stiens or something like that.

Another option is to =almost= kill a mob, then zone out, leaving the 
cleric to finish off the mortally wounded mob and get all the exp.  This 
isn't as good as it sounds because there's a limit as to how much exp 
you can get from a mob, meaning you end up still killing low reds or 
wasting effort, and even finishing off a low red can take a while with 
cleric melee output.  Later the cleric will get Atone... and still, 
having him cast this plus finishing off the mob will often be more 
trouble than its worth.  Killing easier mobs means having to zone out 
(or cast atone) more often and ends up being sort of the same problem.

Yet another good option is to get him in a nice group (or just a 
partner)  thats chewing up mobs with abandon, and cast your buffs and do 
some ranger healing on the MT for that group, with this plan you can 
also do some damage to the mobs if you are careful not to outdamage the 
attributed damage the group is doing (remember you are still looking at 
DS, possibly more than before if they have a DS caster in the group).  
The idea here is to take a group that works and just make it work better 
and with less down time.   This last option will work up thru much 
higher levels than the porcupine plan, althought at low levels it won't 
work nearly as fast.

By and large, a druid, even a much lower level druid, would be better 
suited to this task, I can't think of anything specific that a ranger 
can do for the purpose, you'll essentially be in the "and a low level 
druid" part of your hybridness.  The areas where a ranger shines, vastly 
superior tracking and melee output, are really not particularly useful 
for PLing purposes, and while your lower AC makes you a little better 
for the job of DS dummy than say a paladin, its still going to be waaaay 
too high to really take a beating, while a druid can manage to get hit 
easily enough and never has to worry about riposting.
