Simply put there is nothing illegal about it. At the VERY WORST you are 
in breach of contract with SOE by transfering the account to a new user 
without their express consent.

Fortunately it is not a crimal offence to breach this contract. There 
*are* repercussions however, that SOE can exersise at their option, but 
they don't really have much teeth.

1) They can ban you. This can and does happen, although not nearly as 
often as accounts are bought and sold. They have essentially total 
control over the game, and can more or less at will choose to cease 
service. You pay a subscription to a game service, you do not own 
electronic assets. Even for joe average who hasn't broken any 
rules...they can wipe your account, and as long you can still play (ie 
they are providing service) they haven't 'stolen' anything from you. 
(They would however likely lose a customer, and probably several over 
such an event)

2) They can sue you. Trouble is theirs not much point. The breach of 
contract lawsuit typically seeks damages to compensate for losses 
incurred as a result of the breach. Selling an account, it can be 
argued, actually preserves a revenue stream that would otherwise be lost 
so selling the account may actually profit them... and at worst all they 
can argue the new player didn't purchase the retail boxes... currently 
at best a 50.00 dollar value (for evolutions + ldon). Plus the PR 
nightmare of suing a customer is something most business want to avoid.
