I decided to go back and review the EULA in this context, and I'll
admit that it starts out saying it "describes the terms on which SOE
offers you access to an account to play [their] game".  Those terms,
which you agree to when you click "I Accept" to start up the patcher,
include things like "a non-transferable license to use the Software
solely in connection with playing the Game" (which is defined earlier
to refer exclusively to SOE's game).

So by using the software to access a private server, you're definitely
violating the EULA, but the EULA itself seems to say it's laying out
the terms by which they offer you access to an account.  So if you use
the software to access a private server, and they find out, they are
within their rights to cancel any EQ account you have with them.  That
is true not just for whoever's running the private server, but anyone
who uses SOE's software to play on it.  Of course, if you're looking to
play on a private server you might not care if your Sony EQ account were
to be wiped out.

Anyway, I'll grant that using the game to access the server might not
carry any penalty more severe than that.  At least, I don't see any
place where previously agreeing to the EULA means I've entered into a
contract limiting my actions.  It's the continued access to my account
that requires continued adherence to the EULA.

Totally separate from that, is the question of copyright on the game
content.  If you reuse any of the art or text dialogs, I'd expect you
could get nailed on that.
