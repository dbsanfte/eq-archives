I feel your pain. I once escorted 2 50+ Iksar players from WC to SolB.
They had auctioned "Paying Well for port and Guide to Lavastorm/SolB".
The average port on my old server was 10PP, so I would have been happy
to get 20pp for the two of them. "Paying Well" turned out to be 5pp. 

My own fault as well, but from that point on I never pay-ported for
less than 10pp a head (I would port anyone for free to any zone I was
headed to for personal reasons.), and demanded payment upfront.

Druids are the most loved/hated class in EQ :-P
