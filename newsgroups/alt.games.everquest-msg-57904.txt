  If by "fench" you mean "French", one recommendation I'd make is that you
play on the Antonius Bayle server.  It's based somewhere in Europe and thus
has a higher concentration of European players so you're probably more
likely to find somebody who can speak your language there.  Overall, though,
I'm thinking EverQuest is going to be pretty difficult to get in to if you
can't speak English somewhat fluently... but if you can find a group (or
maybe a guild) of French speaking players, you ought to be alright.
Especially once you learn all the acronyms, abbreviations and other EQ
lingo.

  Good luck.
