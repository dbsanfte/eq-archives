Thanks for sharing =)  It seems that few things can really take the place of
those first unknown encounters.  The nice thing is that feeling can happen
many times as you progress, and new lands open to you for experience and
treasure.  The first time I looted a whole platinum piece off a monster I
was beside myself.  The first few runs up the river in Firiona Vie to reach
the Lake of Ill Omen were lessons in nail-biting tension.

OH, BTW in case no one else has pointed this out yet:  finding bats and
goblins and skeletons in Kaladim is pretty rare;  the city guard usually
keep their populations at zero.  But that's Okay, we all knew you meant
Butcherblock ;-)

Keep up the fine work, and congratulations on not fleeing the skeleton.
