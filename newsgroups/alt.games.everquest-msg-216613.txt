An even  better way to describe it:

Healing the 2k tank gets you 5hp/mana.
Healing the 7k tank gets you 17.5hp/mana.

An even better reason there was that, with better mitigation, regen becomes 
more effective (and, due to avoidance, DS becomes *less* effective)

On top of that, any class without a % based heal(IE any non-cleric in the 
Days of Yore) could heal a monk nearly equally well.
