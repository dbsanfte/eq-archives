Scenario : He promised a Cobalt BP or a high-end weapon in a few days or a week.


Question : Is he going to solo Trakky?? 
Answer: Don't think so, coz Trakky as far as I know is not soloable (or is it?)

Question : Since he can't solo Trakky, he must need help and where can he get
help from?? (BTW, what makes him so sure that Trakky will drop warrior bp
anyway?)
Answer : Friends/guild

Question : Why his friends and guild don't support him with low end armors, like
some crafted?
Answer : His guild is so uber that all his guild warriors has deleted their
crafted or what ever dropable bp they used to use before they got their no
drops. 

Question : If his guild is so uber, why not his guild help him to camp some
armor?? A decent group can camp the spider bp in DN. 
Answer : dunno 

I just hope that he will return to you with a high-end weapon. BTW, what's the
defination of high-end? If lammy, probably he can do it......but my definiation
will be a frostbringer. 

Anyway, wish you good luck
