if your complaining about thats all and enchanter does,  get used to it,
untill your 50+ that is ALL you  will be doing clarity, haste rinse repeat
as needed, and mesmerising of course. i did OT  till 35 then headed to DL,
its hard for a group there but i got it  and got 45 pretty fast. then head
into KC,  then moved around a bit to seb, and velks. i didnt like KC alot.
but in a group thats all you do, is mezz, clarity,haste. and a few other
things here and there for the majority though, thats it.
