Ya the mana drain hurt us.  I know about lucy and ingame lucy bots and such,
but the first part of the fight was just so hectic. Slow wouldn't land, spam
heals (aka very mana intensive) were being needed, I was having to dodge in
and out of battle when ramp took me low, as well as healing the other monk
on ramp dmg.

By the time it was finally slowed (at like 90 percent!! it took a while) the
dot had been on everybody, and everybody was <20mana. I tried radient cure,
and low and behold 6x cured messages. When slowed cheal could be used too,
so the next 30 minutes peoples mana actually went up as we fought :p  So a
very dodgy start, almost disasterous few minutes, followed by like 35 of an
"assured" victory walk home heh.
