He's there for the ranger newbie weapon quest. Talk to the newbie ranger
quest guy in the ranger guild in Surefall Glade. Don't remember the exact
details, but you turn in the head to get an unsharpened sword; sharpen the
sword; hand in sharpened sword with a Giant King Snake Skin (or something)
and get the cool Pinedude Sword of Newbie Uberness. Don't remember the
stats.
