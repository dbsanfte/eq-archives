Damn, I loooove people who feel a need to leave the tracking wolves up
when they do their 8th shawl. I had to wait till REALLY late at night
to do mine because we had to clear out a bunch of them (we did it with
5 people, cos we rock and all that; they gave 2 groups a hard time
when the same thing happenend to one of us another night) to see if
maybe my dorf general would repop after they were gone.
Anyway, whoever managed to train them to bridge was more than likely
acting on pure survival instinct and not necessarily stupid enough to
try to kite them.
