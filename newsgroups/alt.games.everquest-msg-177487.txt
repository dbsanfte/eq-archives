How much you earning an hour?  With a good drum you should be able to do
the shopping quest in PoP fairly quick.  I was making a level in about 3
hours and about 100 pp an hour doing it with my cleric - a week later I
was lv 39 and 1.2k in the bank even after paying for kei and sow potions
which you wouldn't need.  Of course there go your mele skills even
more...
