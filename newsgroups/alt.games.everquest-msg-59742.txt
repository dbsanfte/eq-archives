No, it means like he said the green or light blue is just giving less
xp. You are not receiving a penalty, but since you are say level 35
and its light blue to you its not going to give as much XP as a blue
since of course a blue gives more XP. It takes more to move your xp
the higher level you get so of course anything green (or now light
blue) is going to move it a lot less than a full blue.
