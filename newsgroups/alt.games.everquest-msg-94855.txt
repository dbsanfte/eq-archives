Let me clarify, I was pulling a quad, and had to swim under the platform
where the mage was sitting, his pet was under there killing the spawns as
they came, I got stunned by one goblin that was not snared, which gave time
for the other goblins to come start hitting me, but one of the goblins
attacked the pet because I had the maximum number of melee things on me and
it wanted something to do.  At this point I couldn't run because I was too
low on health anyways, so I tried to gate, and failed, woke up at my bind
point and saw the mage getting swarmed.

Also, I got a rez, however the mage wasn't responding to any stimuli, so the
cleric who would've rezzed the mage (90%er) had he been there, went off and
did other things.
