No, but the at least they have something worthwhile to look forward
to.  They are worthless PvP classes for 3 levels (6, 7, 8).  Warriors
suck at PvP for 65 levels.

How can you call that on top?  Sure.  Of all the pure melee classes,
which hybrids are until level 9, Warriors could arguably be among the
best PvP classes for that one single reason: hitpoints.  (Though even
that is arguable.)  But the only reason to play a hybrid is to get to
level 9 and to get a snare, a pet, or a DoT.  A level 8 sucks sucks at
PvP.  But at least he will see a snare at level 9.  A warrior will
just continue to suck.
