Stop putting things in perspective! Don't be so darn reasonable!
This is Usenet, we don't tolerate reasonable bastards here!

$3? That's a drink at a bar (If you live in a country run by humans;
where I'm from it's more like half a drink, no tip). Those bastards!
I have to get by with one fewer drinks every two months because of
them! Screw'em, I'm cancelling! Who wants my gear?

Add in the fact that this is the first rate hike in 3 years,
and (as others have mentioned) all the expansions mean many
more physical machines per world, I really can't find a way to
get upset over this. Betcha someone will, though.
