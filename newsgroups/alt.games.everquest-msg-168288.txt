    It will get to that point. But let's take the last crash we had, in a
trial in HoH. We've just finished a quick, intense encounter. A mob is
spawned that you have to hail to get flagged for the event. It will despawn
in five minutes from when it popped, which was when the last mob died.
Plenty of people are dead. There's very good loot, four pieces, that the
officers need to assign. And we're racing another guild to get to another
encounter.

    My timeline: I hail the mob, then run around casting resses on whatever
bodies have yet to be clicked. Heal up my group, get a CotH to the next
trial we're racing to get, camp to clear out of the old raid (another raid
of people had to join up with us), zone crashes.

    Someone else's timeline: they die. They finally get a res, run to hail
the flag mob, run back to loot their corpse before it gets poofed to the
graveyard (10 minute timer). One of the loot items would be an upgrade for
them, they send a tell and wait around the bodies. The normal mobs that
would be in this area start to respawn, they defend themselves without part
of the raid force (which has CotH'ed to the next room to hold it). Just as
loot is being called, the zone crashes.

    I had time to camp, they did not.

    They can get the items they loot back if they remember to do a /report
of the line showing them looting it, though. So that's what they're about to
start doing.

    James
