Buy you *could* use it to solo Hill Giants all day long in Rathe Mountains
and have very little downtime (if any) at all .. which was the point I'm
trying to make. My 60 Wizard, even though he has some impressive nukes
cannot solo (even greens) for very long without having to sit on his ass
meditating for *long* periods. To *me* at least, this should be balanced
out, as the only *pet* (laughable) we get is the Flaming Sword and this
can't be used unless the mob is being engaged is a tank, and even when the
mob dies the *Sword* poofs ..

To throw something else into the mixing pot here too is the new travel
system within the PoP expansion, whilst I can only speculate I'm pretty sure
that we'll find that travel will be made much easier for the non-porting
classes, thus taking even more away from the Wizard. We'll see soon enough
..

Stevie.
