On my server, there's a female human monk who
ended up training my group countless times back
in my "teens" when we were hunting around the Minotaur
caves in Steamfont.  We could never quite figure
out if she was malicious or just stupid (not that
it mattered much...)

I did not encounter her at all until about a year
later, when in the mid 40's I was in a King room
group in Sol B and she wandered in asking if
we could let her know if what's-his-name spawned
(the NPC for a monk quest).  We said "sure", and
a few minutes later she runs into the room
asking for help with the two Kobolds that were
trailing her.  We zap them and get the exp, no
big deal.  But then I started recalling my
experiences with her in Steamfont, and the next
time she came barrelling into the room, I
didn't waste time, I just called "TRAIN!" to
my group, and sure enough, 4-5 Kobolds came
roaring in after her and aggroed on us, and
we had to zone.

I just have one question -- HOW IN THE HELL
DOES A HIGH LEVEL MONK *EVER* CAUSE A TRAIN?


>No... my asshole list is written in pen.

Wise decision.
