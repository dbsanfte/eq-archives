Ok with a pair, you could try the Mushroom Temple area in Dawnshroud Peaks,
it's pretty easy to solo at 30 so a pair should be fine.  Netherbian Lair or
Marus Seru are also good at that level range.  There are a few areas of Echo
Caverns that are good as well, but you need to do a little homework because
the level range varies from low twenties all the way to low fifties.

With a pair, you could also try the wolves in Great Divide.  Cougars in Ice
Clad, or in Eastern Wastes there are areas you can hunt from low 30's all
the way to low 50's.

In Timorous Deep there is an island with Golras that's good at around 30th
level.

I think Hollowshade is around the 25-30 range also, but do some homework
I've farmed there a bit, but never levelled there.
