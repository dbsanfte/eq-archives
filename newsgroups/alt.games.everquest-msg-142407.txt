1)  Because the populus insists on remaining too ignorant to guide the
markets, especially when the mass media is bought and paid for by certain
parties.

2)  Because many things can be hidden from the market's awareness, even in
an educated society.

3)  The state should only curb the worst of abuses, and even then, only when
the public is unknowingly put in jeopard, when the public is unwillingly put
in jeopardy, or when fraud comes into play.
