Find the Caster's Guild (if you zone into Neriak Commons and turn right and
run past the doorway to Neriak Underground or whatever it's called, you'll
see a ramp leading up to a small gate).  After you enter the gate, the first
guy on your right sells Gate, Bind Affinity, Shielding, etc.  Basically a
bunch of the "generic" cast spells are sold there.
