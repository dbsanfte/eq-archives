I have done some reading on the Quest to reset your specialization skills to
49. The websites that I have visited all state the quest is for Mag, Enc,
Nec, and Wiz. Just FYI it will also work with Clerics and Druids for those
of you that Screwed up and let the wrong skill reach 50 first. Ostorm in the
Temple of Ro (Lavastorm) will reset your specializations skills back to 49
for a Ruby (Vendor purchased)
