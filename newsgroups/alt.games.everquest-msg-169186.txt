Well if your warrior was low INT and you were *truly* roleplaying (for most
people roleplaying is done within limits, i.e., you may make your character
appear to be a certain way but you don't necessarily act that way when I
comes to critical game strategies), you would most definitely *not* be
leading the group through the dungeon, you would be following along
slack-jawed like the dumb ape you're roleplaying :)  And if you wanted to
play a character like that, if someone asked you to lead off, you'd just
kind of stare at them and say something like, "S'dark in there, me no
wanna..."  And you would certainly never offer unless your role was to be so
enimently moronic as to not only be unable to successfully lead but to
consistently *think* you can...  In which case people who were willing to
take you along for your dismemberment skills alone (which would have to be
quite impressive to outweight your neanderthal, or should I say bacterial,
intelligence) would soon learn to tactfully suggest that someone else lead.
