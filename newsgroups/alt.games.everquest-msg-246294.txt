I find guk to be *much* harder to target in lately, making it impossible 
to finesse pulls. If your just going to pull a room, slaughter it, and 
pull the next no problem... which makes a much harder theme overall.

Takish is about equal with Guk, IMO, but that opinion

I'm to the point where I try to lull past the charmers the unless im 
with a full group or have no choice. I've experienced more downtime and 
death due to charmers than anything in ldon.

Last night the sk in the group got charmed by a wandering chanter, he 
proceeds to mow down the cleric and monk while the rest of the group 
gets enthralled... and then then the wanderer heads back into the 
dungeon... DEEP in, drops charm and then a room or two lays into him. 
He's then out of the fight for the next 20 minutes. Not fun.
