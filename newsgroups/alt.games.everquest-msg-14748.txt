When you have a pack or two full, making the run is great.  CB Belts are
also an easy way to PL someone so you will see a lot of peeps buying them to
give to their PL target.  Selling just a couple belts at 1pp each is not
much cash in the grad scheme, but 4pp will buy a heck of a lot of spells low
level, or one OK (for a low level) piece of basic gear for a warrior type,
like a better weapon than the free one you start with.  So you may want to
sell a few to the peeps that are buying, but I sure would turn in most of
what I got.

The belts' XP begin to fall off at around level 8 or 9.  You need a good
deal of them at that point.  However, Lego Pads, which are turned in in
pairs, still make it worth the trip.  So keep a hold of the belts you get
later, and wait till you have 2 or 4 lego pads to make the run.  The large
chunk of Lego Pad XP will be complimented by the smaller belt XP.  Once you
hit 12, you might think about hunting elsewhere, but it depends on your
goals.  By 15 there definitely are better places to be XP wise.  Also, at 15
the XP from pads is dwindling.  I don't remember exactly when Lego Pad XP is
not worth the time it takes to get them.  It has been a while since I turned
any in.

The Bank in Kaladim is not that far from the warrior guild where they are
turned in, so it is easy to use the bank to make your trip lighter.  That
will help a lot if you are a caster and don't have the ability to heft all
your junk, and a few packs of belts or pads.  Also, if you are young and
turning in, there is a good chance you can beg a SoW for the trip, or tag
along with a Bard.  A lot of druids and bards of sufficient levels pass
through Kelethin all the time for spells, etc.
