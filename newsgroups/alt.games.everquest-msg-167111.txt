}>}Ah, so now you are calling spelling mistakes intentional?
}>No, he's saying that misspellings are not necessarily unintentional.  Typo, 
}>sure, unintentional by definition.  Spelling mistake, again, yes, 
}>unintentional.  Misspelling?  Not so.  Consider "Pleeeeeeease?"  Is it 
}>properly spelled?  Do you think I put too many e's in it by accident?
}Not necessarily? That's not the same thing as he said. He just said
}"misspellings", not just ones done deliberately, and most people don't
}see the word misspellings and think they mean intentional.

No, however, in the context, unintentional misspellings, as you so wisely 
pointed out, would not have made any sense, so he must therefore have meant 
intentional ones.  Capiche?

}Anyways yes, you have a point, and much of the argument was fallout
}from him going into a towering rage at his writing skills being
}questioned.

I hardly see 'a towering rage' here.  He's sworn what, once?  Twice?  Looks 
more like he wants to lead you around in pointless little circles, then 
crow proudly about having done it, while you do the same.  Even though you 
were both going to go around in pointless little circles anyway, so it 
isn't really much of an accomplishment.

}I found that highly entertaining. I knew he could never
}leave off of it, he's had a vendetta against me for over a year. :-)

Oh, come now, who -doesn't- have a vendetta against you? :)

}So I pushed his buttons.

Surely he has more interesting buttons than that?  Come on, I want 
fireworks here!

}I don't disagree with much else of what he
}said; I myself might have said exactly the same thing about eight
}years ago before I learned better, learned that emoticons were just a
}new way, not an inferior way, of expressing things.

Yuh.

}Some are really ugly though. Simple is better. Cutesy ones draw the
}wrong kind of reaction, in my experience.

Yuh, I'd consider the ones with noses too cutesy.  But then, my stepmom 
uses some really off the wall ones rather effectively.
