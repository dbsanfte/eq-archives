Errr HUH?

Carnage is discounted because it doesn't stack with avatar.. both are shaman
spells so only the highest can be counted.

FoN stacks with SoP/SoT.. heck if you want to include bih'li, I'll say wolf
form instead of FoN - just as situational, more ATK.
Ok, greater wolf form = 54ATk after modifiers

Its not just the dot cost, its the friggin hassle of reapplying a spell on
you every 5 minutes.
1) Im sure they are a bit busy on a raid anyway
2) Why should they pick YOU of *ANYBODY* when its a 5min+ recast on a 6min
duration spell?

So its hardly a spell the whole raid can benefit from.. when 1 person is
tied down just keeping it up on one person.

For 6 mins, ferocity at a peridot cost.  Were talking a raid here, LOTS of
melees, thats not a friggin solution for everybody like SoP and SoT is

Ferine is nice, I don't have it tho.. infact 1 single shaman has it in my
whole guild.
Were at a pretty high end and get a lot of runes...  maybe we just have bad
luck hey?  Or maybe its a rare as hell spell, I dunno.

The only time I take brells (assuming a ranger is present) is when pulling
VT.  I know of nobody but certain warriors and occasional pulling monks who
take Brells over SoT/SoP.

In my guild at least, you will find that many prefer SOP and SoT
