One of them on each server will generally make a comment on some board
implying that they are doing fairly well at some encounter. Then the
rest of them who ever killed anything bigger than Phinny will chime in
saying what a bunch of n00bz they are and informing them that
such-and-such is the top guild. This goes on for months and billions of
Gigs of server storage space in messages until the one who can hold
their breath the longest is declared the uberguild for that server.
