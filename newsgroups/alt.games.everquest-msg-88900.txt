    Iksar also have a special feature to their Forage: they can get the
special odd forages that one normally requires 100 skill to acquire.

    Nope. The only thing that can change what you forage is how you're
feeling - if you're hungry or thirsty, the next successful forage will be of
a type to eliminate the problem.

    The problem is, in a lot of Kunark zones there's so many questish
forages that you can go a while without getting food or drink.

    You should be self-sufficient. My monk is always ahead of the game for
water (never drinks into his one stack, I force-feed any water I forage),
and usually ahead on food (I force-feed, which halves the duration of what I
forage, to keep his Dragon Steak from being eaten). If you want a quality
food, check the vendors in Cabilis in the tent area close to the Court of
Pain. One of them carries Fish Head Soup, which is one of those 0.1 weight
Hearty meal deals. That'll last you a while, until you can build up enough
foraging stock to never run out.
