Really?  I didn't get that impression, I thought he was saying it was a 
beauty contest, judge's whim.

Course he could be covering up the fact that he's using a RNG to pick 
winners (if any) out of a hat, but I don't see where "we'll pick what we 
like" would be any harder, in fact it strikes me as easier.

While I'm generally paranoid, I also tend to favor the "lazy people will 
do things the simplest way" assumption.
