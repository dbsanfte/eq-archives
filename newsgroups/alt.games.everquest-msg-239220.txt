	Well, gee...  Maybe the only time he can play is during those
hours.  Maybe he was camping one of those annoying timed spawns that
would have popped at 6-10am...  Maybe he just expects the service to be

	Last summer I was working a contract job involving a looonnnnggg
commute.  I'd get up 2 hours early so I could get some EQ in before work,
and I'd get pretty annoyed to find yet another unscheduled downtime.
