Not really.  I know plenty of people above 50 who always have to have it
on.  

There's two issues with it:  

1) It lets casters below the approved lv (46 I think) gain xp assininely
fast - which "ruins" the game because they don't know how to play
non-kei'd, and there aren't many casters that lv anymore (especially
healers), and those that are want to solo,  which makes it hard for
group required classes such as rogue and warrior to level.

I'd dissagree with it ruining the lower end game, but it has some
serious issues.

2) Enchanters of any level aren't wanted (or needed) in groups as much.

I haven't found any problems with getting groups with my 55 enchanter
recently, and infact have had to ward them off with a sick.  And there's
several times at the 40 lv with my cleric I've been desperate for an
enchanter and been unable to find any.
