Ok, here's the list as posted on http://www.magecompendium.com/  I was
wrong about the all-or-nothing resists, but they are Magic or Fire based
and if I'm reading it right, they have an additional penalty of 25 points
plus whatever the mob has naturally.  Since the pet casting these spells
will be somewhere around level 45, try to imagine the effectiveness of a
level 45 wizard casting the same spells against any of the Vellious
super-mobs.  Or against any level 35 Kunark or Velious mob, actuall.  Also,
I've heard that the fire pets still have a nasty tendancy to run in and
melee, rather than casting spells from long range.  They're one of the few
pets whose damage output actually *improves* if something Roots them. 
Also, I've heard of these pets using Cancel Magic and some kind of AoE
spell, though neither is listed on the website.  So it's possible they cast
spells besides these.  I'll have to wait until I own one to know for sure,
probably.  Oh, and please note, that the post 50 Fire pets do *not* get
Fire Elemental Aura, the awesomely powerful Fire pet damage shield.  They
get the laughable O'Kiel's Radiation instead.  Dyzil's Decoy gets Fire
Elemental Aura II, and is the only post-50 pet that can use it.

Shock of Lightning
Level 12 Wizard spell
Max 83 damage
Resistance check:  Magic + 25

Force Shock
Level 20 Wizard spell
Max 179 damage
Resistance check:  Magic + 25

Flame Shock
Level 16 Wizard spell
Max 110 damage
Resistance check: Fire + 25

O'Kiel's Radiation
Level 4 Wizard spell
minor damage shield, max 2 points of damage per blow

Shieldskin
Level 16 Wizard spell
Absorbs 55 points of damage max, self only for PCs.

Not exactly a fearsome lineup.  And since the best spell in the lot still
only hits for 179 damage, I'd rather have a water pet.  Their Elemental
blast hits for almost as much, and they've got a ton more hitpoints.  And
the level 54 Water pet can backstab.
