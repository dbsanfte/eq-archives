Sorry to hear you choose the wrong class.  :(

Clearly with your bank account a Ranger would be much more useful
for the intent of being a tradeskill-ingredients-collector,give him an
enchanted sah of wonder (31 % haste),Iksar BP for the 5 point regen,
some kind of 1 hand weapon without recommened level like Jade mace
(9/18),Defiance or Lamentation (both 9/19) and he will fly through the
levels 1 to 45 without the need for 2boxing.
 Later he can farm greenies more efficient than a Druid,because of his
*MUCH* higher dps,and maybe you find him more entertaining to play
 than *another* priest class.
Made my WOODELF Ranger GM-Smith,although it makes not much 
sense,because farming for shadowscream in Hollowshade and Twilight
is laughable easy with him.
For example,I skipped the Plate phase up to 162,cause it was so much
easier and cheaper to make humming orbs.

Btw,easiest way to GM baking is with Griffon meat,so much easier now,
since there is the new zone Nedarias Landing,nice,cute level 20
Griffons there,while at the same time you can forage plant shoots,
which also will lead to 248 baking.
