MORE IGNORANCE.

Bin Laden is not representative on the Palestinians.  He's a mad man who
attacked capitalist America.
Isreal comes in the picture becuase the U.S. has sold to them military
weapons that they use against the Palestinians.
Just one of Bin Laden's many motives for being rash and killing 4,000+
people.

true... but Bin Laden is mad/rash as well as stupid.. and its HIS money.
he'd rather attack capitalist america...

unreasonable and ignorant posts by someone who probably considers himself a
patriot is much worse.
that's not true patriotism.. that's just being senseless.
