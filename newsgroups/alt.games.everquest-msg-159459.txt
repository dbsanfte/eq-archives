You are aware that Karnor's (you know, the zone inside the castle in DL)
has plenty of undead in it?  There's also Lower Guk on Antonica, you
can even solo effectively there once you learn the zone.  And for more
excitement the Vampires in Tenebrous Mountains on Luclin are undead,
but they'll take your lunch money and make you cry if you try them solo.
A trio of Druid, Paladin, Paladin works ok, Druid roots adds, spot
heals, and nukes while the Paladins keep the target stunned as they
kill it (they have a nasty lifetap-type proc).
