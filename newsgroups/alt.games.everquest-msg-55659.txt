Then don't participate in them. There are plenty of unaffected zones.

One of the common complaints about game events is that so many people
don't get to participate, because the event is over before they
arrive. The halloween events we're seeing now take care of that
complaint.

It's no more unrealistic than any other mob that respawns a short time
after it has been killed. Any role-player that feels slapped in the
face by this is playing the wrong game.

>No role-playing goes on in any zone of my server (Tunare),

Then the current events haven't harmed the role-playing on your
server, have they?

>Any good loot? No not really, not as far as I have heard or seen.

Then your definition of good is apparently using uber-planes loot as
the baseline. Some of the stuff dropped during this event has been
excellent. My 40 druid picked up three different items that were
better than what I'd been wearing, and that character wasn't exactly a
slouch in the equipment department.

>Is it really that usefull to have these? Its exciting once in awhile

I've enjoyed them, so for me, yes they've been useful. Judging from
the number of other folks hanging out champing at the bit for the next
round to start, I'm not alone.

In case you hadn't noticed, everything in this game repeats itself.
