Dragon Warrior was the first RPG? I don't think so. First console RPG?
nope.
First popular console RPG in the US? Yes..maybe.

The first Phantasy Star came to the US before Dragon Warrior. The only
problem was that it appeared on a not very popular Sega Master System.
I played both and loved both, but Phantasy Star has more depth. Both
have something in common though. Graphically, they can't compare to
RPGs of todays or many other games of other genre at their own time
either. In fact, many people didn't understand RPGs. You move an
iconic character around, very little animation, and menu driven
fights. What is that all about?

The big issue about "graphics" is that too many game developers give
to much emphasize on it while sacrificing other elements of the
game..ie gameplay, music, story, level design, and longevity. If a
game has all elements to make a good game, I have no problem with it.

Old school RPGs vs new school RPGs. The biggest difference is
definately graphics. New-schoolers may have a hard time understanding
why some old-schoolers play a game with archaic iconic characters. But
to old-schoolers the new games just leave a lot less imagination to
work with. When everything is rendered, there are less things for your
brain to interpret. In the old days, the lack in graphics permit your
imagination to do more work. Just like reading a good book, the way
you interpret and get involved with a story may be different from
someone elses experience with that same story.
