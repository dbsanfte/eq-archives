Correct. And that's exactly why the amount the level 60's xp bar moves
is lower. (Or non-existant if he's a 59. he he.) Take this as an
example. Let's say a decaying skeleton in W. Freeport newbie area is
worth 10 XP. And let's say your level 1 human warrior needs 100 XP to
ding to level 2. (I'm just pulling numbers out of my ass here, ok? But
the comparison is valid. Hang in there.)  If you kill that skeleton,
you've gotten 10% of the XP you need to ding, so you'll see a jump of
1/2 of a yellow, or two and a half blues of xp for the kill.

By the time you are level 20, you might be killing Gargoyles worth 1000
XP. But the problem is, it's going to take you 30,000 XP to ding 21.
(Because, as you say, the increase in the amount needed per level is not
linear. It takes larger and larger jumps each level.) Now, when you kill
that Gargoyle, you've not gotten 10% of the xp needed to ding, but
instead, only a little over 3%. So you get just under one blue bubble of
xp bar movement.

This disparity continues on all the way to the end of the game, with the
obvious exception of the hell levels at 54 and 59. So while the level 40
may only be getting 40% of the xp on the mob, the level 60 requires SO
much more xp to move their XP bar, the level 40's bar moves much faster.

A silly mistake. But come on... you knew we'd poke fun at you for it.
