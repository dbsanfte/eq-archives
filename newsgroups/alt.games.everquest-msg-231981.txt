   I play with my RL husband, our computers are a couple of feet from each
other.  I find that it has helped our teamwork, being able to speak directly. 
But OTOH, I _wouldn't_ want to hear all the chatter from the rest of group when
I am focusing on the health bars.  I can't see how actually _hearing_ the
frantic screams of the wizard "Oh no, Oh God heal me now  HEAL ME NOW DAMMIT!" 
would enhance my playing experience.
