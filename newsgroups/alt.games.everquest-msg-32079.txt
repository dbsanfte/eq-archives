5 months ago, I was maxxing out at 36 damage with my Axe of the
Ironback at level 20. Now, I'm maxxing out at 33 damage at the same
level. Does this have something to do with the 2H slashing patch,
where 2H slashing weapons with a delay above 39 received a damage
'bonus'? Based on the patch message, the damage output of a 16/37 2H
slashing weapon should have stayed exactly the same. Is this some sort
of stealth nerf (it can't be a bug because it would have been fixed by
now)? I know that according to the patch, 2H slashing weapons with
less than 30 delay do less damage now, but the damage output of a
16/37 weapon should not have changed.
