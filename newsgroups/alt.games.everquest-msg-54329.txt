You don't, obviously. But on the first floor of ToFS, to fight the
shadowbeasts, you would have to be travelling back and forth between the
entry hall and the rooms where they spawn. To get there, you need to run
right past a pit full of shadowbones. I'm just saying that those having
IVU would generally choose to keep it up for that portion of the run to
avoid dragging a drain of undead on their ass into the shadowbeast area.

However, since you have no IVU, and more importantly have informed us
that you dont' fight "indoors", then the whole point is moot.

So Lokari still hasn't started a character on M-T to petition your name?
