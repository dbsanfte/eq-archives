Getting that upset in the first place about a single giant seems like an
overreaction, better to just leave the zone if that happens, rathe basically
is a cash farming place, for good or ill.

The GM's behaviour was probably due to the zones rep, and also you dont know
what the other guy was telling him. (and did the GM even see him KS?),
sounds like you were trying to make him KS with the GM there...
