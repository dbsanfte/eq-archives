Well, it could, they could move Slansin to the main Erudin
city zone and out of the Palace zone, forcing you to zone
between each iteration, like the Janam-and-Rebby quests
in Freeport that give almost identical faction hits.

But people have been pulling Slansin for *forever*, and
that technique is described on tons of EQ websites.
I have yet to see anyone mention getting warned for it.

And it's not like it makes gaining faction trivial -- even
after pulling Slansin to make it faster, it still takes
HOURS of clicking to partially recover from, say, a Lucan
killing.
