Your arguing about what I have observed . I fail to understand how that can
ever help . Either im lying about my observation, mistaken , or correct.

A) It is fairly easy to get around the trivial loot code . This encourages
the people who are already farmers (makes the loot worth more ) and
encourages more people to become farmers .

B) It ruins the game for several reasons which have been renumerated
countless times now . The one that gets me is the destruction of a good part
of the role playing enviroment , and that there is no positives in doing so.

The two are not in the least bit muctually exclusive.
