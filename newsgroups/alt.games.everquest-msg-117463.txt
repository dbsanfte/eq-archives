Well, it shows he feels he's useless and think he's a liability to the 
expedition, which leads me to think that, if he doesn't give his life, 
they would all most likely die according to him , otherwise it wouldn't 
make much sense, if it wasn't to save the others in the expedition, and 
so wouldn't be rational. So in his mind, he had 2 choices, giving his 
life ot just wait to die slowly with the others due to him being a 
liability.. it's a desesparate case to me. Could be rational when you 
think he's doing it to save the others, but it ain't much rational 
still, and it's a completely different story than the poor EQ addict, 
and is also really extreme.

When a decision is obviously wrong, it's not a rational decision.
