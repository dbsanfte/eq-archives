In my experience there's little by way of groups for a mid 30s
character of any sort, best chance would be to hang out in
Overthere... but LDoN will be better exp and loot if you can find
or put together groups for it.  Fortunately, a 32 bard can easily
get huge gobs of experience soloing via charm swarm tactics, so
you don't have to be 32 forever if you can't find a group.

The monk will actually be harder, since the great monk nerf (I
hope you left after that happened or you are in for some sad
news) you won't be able to solo effectively, and only get into
groups as a DPS class; few groups rely on FD pulling these days
either.  I'd head for POJ or POD and look for groups who can use
more damage, and keep the LFG flag up with an LDoN message in the
LFG tool if you have the LOY expansion.
