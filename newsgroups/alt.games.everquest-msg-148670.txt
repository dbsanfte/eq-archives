On the other hand, the October issue of Computer Games included a freee
beta version of Asheron's Call 2.

Very interesting changes coming in the world and the fact it will be
released
a year before EQ2 (EQ released before original AC) might attract a few more
disgruntled EQ players to try it out.  I've been playing both for a while to
see
what the differeneces were like and liked EQ better over all.

AC2, on the other hand, looks really nice and I intend to lose lots of sleep
test driving it.

So, Stormrunners on Saryn will be missing their little Dwarf Cleric for a
while
as I explore AC2 for the next few weeks.
