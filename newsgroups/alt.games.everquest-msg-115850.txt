It's actually better to lace it to a left or right.  You HOLD the forward
key, but you push the left and right over and over again, so you will use
Sense heading much more often.  Forage is another nice one to put on the
other l/r key although it doesn't refresh as fast, but every now and again
you'll suddenly have food or an item on your cursor.  I tend to drop most of
these, but at least it raises the skill.
