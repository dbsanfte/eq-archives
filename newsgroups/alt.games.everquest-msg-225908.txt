Rule 3 doesn't come into it, "martyr" is not a name of a religious
person.

Rule 9 is a definite stretch, unless you accept that farmer, smith,
baker, policeman, et cetera are also "titles".  They aren't; they're
names of jobs.  Now admitted, nobody holds the job "martyr" for long
in the real world, but it's not a title.
