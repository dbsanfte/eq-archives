That used to be true. But at least on our server, the last few times 
we've been there (once hunting, a couple times heading for VP) we were 
the only people in the zone. If clerics aren't actively working on their 
final epic drops, it seems that Skyfire has fallen by the wayside in 
popularity since the later expansions came out. Skyfire has always been 
a fantastic zone for hunting in your fifties, but with such better xp 
available in PoP, it's sadly looking more and more abandoned.
