Damn, there you are insinuating that you have the right to a free rez.

Ya know what?  When I used to play my bro's cleric to make cash I charge a
minimum of 100p just to discourage those assholes who think that rezzes
should be free.

It's my time.  It's my mana.  *I* set the price.   No buyers, no problem.
My druid will totally ignore strangers asking for ports unless they offer
50p or more because MY time is VALUABLE to me.  And that's assuming the port
is CONVENIENT.  If I have to come to them I don't bother unless it's 100p.

If you feel the need to get an xp rez then you need to feel the need to pay
what it's worth if you can't find some bored cleric to rez your ungrateful
stingy bastard ass.
