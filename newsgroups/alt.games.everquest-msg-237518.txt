Judging from that post I think its a L"user" trying to get a kickback.
Normally it would be www.ige.com or something, so the fact they have
the "tracking" in there as well as some numbers shows that it is
someone posting a referral link.

So they can get advertising without ever doing anything naughty
themselves.

AH, yeah:

"Earn a 10% commission on all Dark Ages of Camelot (DAoC), EverQuest
(EQ), Final Fantasy XI (FFXI), Star Wars Galaxies (SWG), and Ultima
Online (UO) sales generated from your referrals. "

and finally:

"IGE highly discourages spamming and may choose to terminate an
affiliate account if a complaint is lodged. "

So there we go!
