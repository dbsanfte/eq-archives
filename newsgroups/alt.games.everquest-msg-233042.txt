Knoppix is GREAT for things like this.  I burned a copy of Knoppix
recently and was "jaw droppingly impressed".  And I've generally thought
of Linux as "not ready for the desktop".  Knoppix (finally) changed my
mind.

For those who don't know, Knoppix is Linux on a bootable CD.  It comes
up in full GUI beauty and has TONS of apps installed.  Including a few
web browsers, office suites, development tools (C, C++, Java, more),
games, the list just goes on and on.

It's amazing what they fit on a single CD.
