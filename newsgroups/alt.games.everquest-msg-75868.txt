Hey all,

I was told if I collected a stack of High Quality Cat Pelts I could sell
them to a tailor and make up to 100PP. I have some questions regarding this:

1. Really?
2. No ... really? =)
3. How many pelts would make a stack.
4. Are stacks of pelts purchased often?
5. Is there anything else I should be hanging onto to sell to other players?

Thanks
