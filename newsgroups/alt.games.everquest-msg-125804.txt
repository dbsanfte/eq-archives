As you've already discovered, you'd take a hit of 15 mana by wearing
the Ry'gorr. Now, exactly how much do you need that 15 mana? 
If you want to wear the Ry'gorr, wear it, and just think of the
difference as 15 less mana to med back. Whether it's 192 or 188, your
wis is still excellent for a low 40s character, and the Ry'gorr is a
damned sight better looking than the bloodstained :)
There is only one thing that would make me wear the bloodstained, and
that is if ditching it will make your dwarven AGI slip under 75.
