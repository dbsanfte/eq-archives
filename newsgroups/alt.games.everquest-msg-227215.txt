You vastly overestimate how much difference 10 AC and +3% parry make.
The extra DPS of a Windblade over the Shadowflame would save more mana
even in the shorterm.

Then why suggest using a weapon where you would take - at best - 1%
less damage (and that's being generous) and lose a chunk of DPS in
return?  If you hadn't mentioned the Windblade and were suggesting
using the Shadowflame over a 31 or 28 delay weapon or whatever when
tanking then, yes, fine.  Ripostes are teh suk, dual wield gets you
killed, news at 11.  

Stopping kicking when tanking saved me around 3% incoming damage.
Adding 50 raw AC saved me a little over 1%.

Err no, Windblade > WMBS for tanking (especially in PoP).  Windblades
on Warriors suck somewhat as it's hard work gaining aggro with one but
for everyone else they are far and away the best commonly available
option.  50/44 is a ludicrous ratio for how easy it is to obtain.
