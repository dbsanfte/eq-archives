I think she would get more experience without you mentoring.  I have a
really good friend that is level 38 (lowest you can group with a 50 and
get xp without them needing to mentor).  Mentoring down to her level is
a real pain... its been so long since I've been there I don't even
remember what arts to use.

I don't think the 5% bonus (up to 15% max I think) makes up for being
able to mow down stuff that cons bright red to her solo.  What I like
to do is get PF groups (she didn't do LS access yet) with one healer,
and then rip through the giants.  The 50s turn off combat xp (seems to
pick it up a bit for the non-50s) and we absolutely shred everything in
the way.  It ends up being awesome experience for her (we did the
similar when she was 37, but mentored down to 49) and we get to earn
some cash to support the raiding habit.

In my mind, mentoring is a great way to get mobs green for loot drops,
hanging out with friends you really out level, or finishing quests that
require a chest drop.  Other than that, if she gets xp when you don't
mentor, she is much better off with you shredding stuff in full force.

Of course, that is just my experience and I could be totally wrong :P
