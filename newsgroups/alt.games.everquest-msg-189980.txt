Hello,

I have just purchased the Everquest Gold package (I should have it by
Monday, woo-hoo!), and thought I would avail myself of the posters
here with a few questions.  I apologize in advance if these have been
done ad nauseum, I don't mean to annoy anyone.

I know there are many different servers, and that (from what I have
read) you cannot move characters from one server to another.  So,
which servers are good for new players to start at?  Which tend
towards role-playing in the way you talk with others, and which should
I avoid for player-versus-player killing (or is this something not
limited to servers)?

I've read a lot of posts about how a lot of people group together --
is it still possible to have an enjoyable time by oneself, or is
gameplay geared more towards grouping up?  I currently don't know
anyone else personally who has EQ, so I'd probably be be myself for
awhile.

Are there any rules of newbie/EQ etiquette that I should pay special
attention to?

I thank you all in advance for your time and trouble in answering me. 
I'm really looking forward to this game, even if I can't use all the
bells and whistles (PC has 128 MB RAM, PIII 700, 32 MB ATI3 card, not
great, but usable).

Thanks again!
