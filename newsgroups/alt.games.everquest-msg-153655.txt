Opinion (at lesat amongst those I know) is pretty split about this
one.  IMHO it's fantastic.  Loved it.  Loved the music, loved the
graphics, loved the story.  Others I've talked to have despised it,
saying it's all eye candy, no substance.

One bonus is it's like, 4 eps or so.  So, a lot cheaper to collect
than Bebop ;)  Have you checked your local gee-- errr comic book
stores? :) They often rent out anime on VHS/DVD.  Even the ones around
me do, although they refuse to carry anything else anime-ish.
