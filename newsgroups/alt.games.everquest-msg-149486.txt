While this is true, generally the area before the tower is regarded as
a medding area by people who aren't KOS to COV faction, and a kiting
area for people pulling wyverns.  Bulthar, who are KOS to everyone,
should probably not be kited up there since that behavior is quite rare and
thus unexpected.  I'd expect to find myself slaughtering several AFK
medders whenever I tried such a thing.  Certainly a wise medder would move
up into the tower or out somewhere further away, but every second spent
moving to a med spot is one thats not spent medding, and (barring someone
bringing up Bulthar or Sirens) the zone is totally safe for someone who's
not KOS to COV or Otters.
