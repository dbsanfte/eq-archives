I was thinking Eurdite, but the problems with the starting zone and
nightblindness.

When I used to play, getting a druid or a wizard to port you was quite an
ordeal.  I know they're busy and all, but some were just rude about it when
you'd ask.  Is it generally better now, or do people just have to walk all
over?  Id like to get the eurdite to the Crushbone area, which is a LONG way
away because thats the starting area Im familar with.

Also, when do magicians get the summon spell to make infravision items?  I
dont remember from when I used to play
