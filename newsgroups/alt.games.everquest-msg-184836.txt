 Not saying that anyone is doing anything on purpose but I have had a ton of
crashes to desktop lately on both home computers. My main is a Dell with
2.25ghz Pentium 4, 1gb of rd ram and 128 Nvidea card. It's very well capable
of handling EQ and don't know why it happens. It doesn't happen anywhere but
Bazaar and I've tried cutting back all setting to nothing when I set up
without success.
 Just letting you know there's another one having the same exact trouble out
here.  =)
 And yes before it's said, all drivers have been updated to check for this.
