Flags and keys are in place to prevent massive PLing.  How would you
feel if a guild took a level 1 toon to Kod'Taz or Plane of Time,
grinded the toon up and gave them high end gear all in one day?  Maybe
then sell the account on eBay or something.

keyed and flagged zones puts a damper on power leveling and loot
whoring.  It does inconvence causual player who otherwise would not
get to see such zones.
