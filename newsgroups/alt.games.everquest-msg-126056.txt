I bought EQ a long time ago. Played the free month I received. Quit. I
admit, I didn't really understand it at the time...

Recently I've gotten into DAoC. Bought it, been playing it, and love it. But
I hear that EQ is a lot more expansive and indepth than DAoC, maybe more
exciting? I can't really remember what EQ was like to be honest, and don't
know which of the two would be more enjoyable.

My question really is this: I have EQ and the first expansion pack. Would it
be enjoyable for me to sign up and start playing it again, or have I missed
too many expansions and now my game would be out-of-date?

Any feedback is appreciated.
