If your DSL was using PPPoE, then switching to cable should certainly 
improve latency (around 20-40ms). You should be able to get around 15ms 
round-trip to another subscriber of your ISP. Further, it will depend on 
the ISP infrastructure, their connection to the backbone etc... 

"dedicated DSL circuit" is a marketing gimmick, you're on public network, 
so the bottleneck can happen anywhere, in particular on your ISP's routers 
and servers. Your home to ISP hop is probably least likely place for the 
bottleneck to happen (unless there's a wiring or interference problem, 
which is a separate story). Many ISPs are using "throttling", because 
they're running out of their bandwidth quota, which illustrates where the 
problem often is.

Overall, the quality of ISP is much more important than your connection 
method (cable or DSL). Unfortunately, there's no way to tell what will work 
better in your area. You can try to search for forums where people discuss 
ISPs in your area, you may get some information there. If you can get a 
trial you can try to traceroute few sites (for example www.microsoft.com) 
and compare number of hops and latencies.

So, my advise is to compare ISP's rather than DSL vs cable, unless you 
absolutely need the lowest possible latency, which is unlikely, because if 
other player is 10000km away you're going to have latency in 0.1s (150ms+) 
anyway.

Alex.
