okay, okay... but have you tried the Crag Spiders in EK? Good kite practice,
and plentiful silk... (it's where I went for 20-22 as a Druid)
You could also try Oasis for a couple of hours... just to work on your
Tracking, picking out those 'blue' DW Crocs.
Other than those 2 I can only suggest HH as well... with maybe outside Paw
as an alternative to CT once you get to around 29-30
