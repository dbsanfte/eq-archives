Good; they've actually realized they've crossed that magical line where 
not fixing the existing problems and pumping out a new expansion is 
actually going to cost them in the long run.

If SOE is admitting it then it pretty much validates the playerbases 
'whining' as some of the less charitable people here would call it.

Will things get a lot better? Probably not, but they should return to 
where they once were at least. SOE has at least learned how far they can 
push it. Too bad it has to happen when players vote with their 
dollars... because if they had been listening these complaints have been 
going on for a long time.

Oh well... corporations are sociopaths... c'est la vie.
