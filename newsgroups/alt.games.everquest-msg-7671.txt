If you twink a warrior, do it right, it's so annoying to see 6th level
warriors carrying Wurmy's. Not because I am jealous (I have turned down the
offer of one already) but because it is so wasted, you won't get any benefit
from a wurmy until around 25th, same for all high delay high Dam weapons. If
you're gonna twink a warrior you want something like a pair of Lammy's (bit
extreme but you want the best, right) and a Naths Great Sword for weapons,
you want lowest delay possible, you're Dam cap will ruin anything that hits
hard.
My pet hate, not twinks, just poorly thought out twinks ;ï¿½)
