Bertoxxulous ...Christmas 2001 (GM Ogre Dressed in Red Passing out
various
 items)
 
On The Seventh Hammer, there was one last March (4th anniversary) - a
"Patrick's Day" battle royale in the Arena.  750pp to enter (free if
you were wearing all green).  The winner (a guildie of mine) got about
22K (all the entrance fees) and an amulet of Necropotence.  Second
place got a CoCW and third got something fairly decent as well.  Tzen
came 4th or 5th (gotta love that TS disc hehe) but was out of the
money.

The coolest thing was that the GM's made us all look like gnomes -
irregardless of race or class.  I have a screenshot of me, a gnomish
ranger :)

I play on GMT so I could have missed many others with my time zone
difference.
