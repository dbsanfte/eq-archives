Not if you go around the spiders, and most of them can't see invis so if you
have camo and just keep going you can make it 99% of the time.  You don't
have to go up the river, I swim across the lake by the shore where the
little dock looking things are straight across to the wall, if you stay on
that wall you won't meet any spiders.
