Had one last night in the Qeynos Newbie Zone shouting, yes *shouting* in all
capitals: "LEVEL 2 SHADOWKNIGHT NEEDS STUFF. PLS PLS HELP!!!". He had it
hotkeyed and was spamming every 30 seconds or so. He wasn't even chasing
down bats and snakes and stuff, just standing around spamming for help.

I ooc'd "It's better to work through the first 5 levels to find out if you
can play the character, and also you don't lose everything to a fast corpse
decay". His witty reply was to hit his spam hotkey three times in quick
succession.

I zoned in to Qeynos Hills and ooc'd "Hey folks, player XXX is begging in
shout spam mode back in Qeynos. Keep that in mind if he makes it out here
OK?" and then sent a tell to the begger "Congratulations Peckerhead, you
famous. Everyone out here in the Hills is dying to meet you... So, exactly
where were you planning on doing level's 4-8 again? LOL"

I passed through Qeynos ten minutes later and noticed he had logged out -
his attention span for that character had proberly expired...
