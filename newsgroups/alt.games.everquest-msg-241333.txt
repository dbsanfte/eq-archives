I found out the hard way though that you DO consume once you step OUT of trader
mode.  I bought a stack of Misty Thicket Picnics and a stack of Qeynos
Afternoon Tea for my cleric.  By the time I got to the bank to put them in the
"shared" bank slot I had already eaten one picnic and had one tea.  Very
expensive lunch for my trader-alt. :(
Now I always keep a stack of rations and water in the top 2 slots...
