Bah, now you're just being difficult. In the OP's example, what's the 
difference between getting a dot or the plat? If you run out, it's not 
like you felt them necessary there in the first place. Besides, what are 
you saving them for? I don't get it. You're the cleric. If group mates 
request buffs and offer payment for the dots, why the hell not?

Always commendable and appreciated. I don't know though. Demanding 
payment in dots instead of plat is kind of haughty for a class designed 
to act in a support capacity. If the buff recipients have dots, great. 
However, if anyone should be expected to have them, it would be the 
cleric.

Can't speak to that. I have never played on PvP. Sounds interesting 
though, and I'll admit I have considered it.
