  With me, it was Corporal Lancot. I'd just finished the Testament of 
Vanear quest, and was a little too tired to connect the faction hits I 
got with the location I was entering...
 "Hmm, Corporal Lancot is casting a spell. Wonder why I've never seen him 
cast anything befoAIIIIIIGHHHHH SWEET JESUS MY SPLEEN!"

  He's now on the "I am *so* going to stomp on you once I get high up 
enough" list.

"I'm sorry, did I offend you just now? Pardon me--I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Really, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
