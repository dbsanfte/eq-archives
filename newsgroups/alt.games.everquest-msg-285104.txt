Hm, I was actually going to ask about the "healer" part, but I'll
take issue with the pet DPS also.

Since "healer" tends to imply the ability to heal others besides
yourself, I'm assuming you don't mean lifetaps, in which case the
only healing I can think of is Dark Empathy, which heals a big big
30 hp while doing damage to you.  I've used it in emergencies (and
when I was helping my wife skill up her cleric's defense) but don't
usually keep it memmed.  Am I missing something?

As for the pet, its damage is helpful but nowhere near what I can
generate myself.  Granted I've got access to better gear than you
have on Combine, but still.  The last time I did a detailed analysis
of damage from a battle was when my group of SK/Bard/Cleric took out
Tserrina in Tower of Frozen Shadow.  We all downed DS potions before
starting, and we lost some of our DPS due to being charmed and being
forced to fight each other (which of course meant hitting the DS
ourselves, but oh well), and toward the end of the fight Tserrina
was backed into a corner and summoned both the bard and me on top of
her where we then got stuck and couldn't see our target, plus mana
was gone, so the DS and pet did the last 8% of her hits.  But even
with that and the charms, the damage breakdown still has me doing
much more than the pet:

The damage broke down as:
  3736 melee Bard
  2303 melee SK
  1247 SK DOTs
   746 other spells (lifetaps, cleric nuke, etc., often partly resisted)
   738 melee pet
  6020 from DS
(There might also have been damage from Bard songs that didn't show
up in my logs.)
