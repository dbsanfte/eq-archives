From a person who 'bots a 65 mage (my original main) with his 65 BL,
and plays with someone who 2 boxes a 65 cleric and wizard (used to
be a cleric/ranger, 2 boxing with the ranger was a LOT of work - 
puller, healer, tank) - I think Chris is pretty much spot on.

2 Boxing a cleric/mage is pretty decent until pop - at which time
the mage pet just soaks up too much damage.

2 boxing a Cleric/BL gives you the basic 3 components of any standard
group - Healer/Slower/Tank (a decently geared BL can tank PoV/HoH) and
allows you to add just about any class and be effective.
