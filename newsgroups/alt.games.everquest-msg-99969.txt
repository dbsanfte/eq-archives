Hi,
I am very surprised that no one has suggested what is arguably the best
caster class .. the Wizard.

You must be used to dying a lot at the lower lvls ... this can be
discouraging to start with but if you stick at it the Wiz is very rewarding.
The class is excellent at soloing at mid/high lvls and is in demand for
groups/raids.

This class has it's inherent disadvantages/advantages like all classes but
for pure casting it is truly the most enjoyable and that from some one who
has tried them all.  The only other that would come close for soloing is the
Necro but they are severely disadvantaged when it comes to groups/raids.

Give it a go.  I have a lvl 51 Wiz (Erudite) and like the hell out of him
... I only love my lady o)

Have fun.
