Hmm poison...  long regarded as a useless "trade"skill.  Now, all my
guildies are in a mad rush to GM poison.  Wtf?!

So Im thinking maybe its not so useless anymore, and it can't be that
expensive (not as much as fucking alchemy cost me to GM, thats for sure)

And my girlf likes doing all those wrist-killing tradeskill thingies...  So
Im wondering if its now a worthwhile thing for my rogue to work on?

I've seen the poison list.. nothing awe-inspiring from the descriptions, but
knowing them would probably give a clearer answer...

So.... is it worth it?   Is it expensive?  Any general tips on working it?

And poison in general... my (limited) understanding of it, is you cast a
potion, and then your BS(primary?) weapon now has the chance to proc a
poison?  And that proc lasts for 15 mins or so?
