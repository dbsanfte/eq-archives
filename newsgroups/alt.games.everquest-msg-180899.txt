I got a pile of axes to grind... sorry if this is a tad incoherent.
1. I find me a nice fairly clear spot back of the bazaar, near the arena.
Put my trader (a gnome) back against the stall  wall, go afk and set an afk
message to the effect that I'm gone, at such and such loc, and that I am
having a special on water, only 10k per flask. I come back and have 7 people
right on top of me, am carrying a stack of bread and an MT rod. As I move
out of where I was standing, I note that there is plenty of room. I'm not on
a corner, near a bank, or anything like that. But there's a stack of people
playing 'use the gnome as a seat cushion' with 30 feet of clear stall space
on either side. This should be treated like the men's bathroom... if
possible keep at least one stall between you and the next guy...

2. Who the hell BROWSES MERCHANTS in the bazaar? I have 40 lookers, 2 buyers
(which bought almost everything I had worth buying) in 4 hours.

I have one guy that browsed my wares 17 times in a row. Is he trying to spam
me LD or something?

3. Quit bitching at me about my prices in Tell... I don't care if a blue
diamond is only worth 225 to you, I'm right in the low end at 350pp, if you
want them farm em or pony up the plat. That's what the Bazaar is for. I put
my tell channel in another window for serious trade offers and so friends
can leave messages for me.

4. What is it with these morons. /auct wts neato doohicky of doom of which 7
are on the /bazaar list' and will
beat current price. PST for link and price.
    a) Where the hell is my link you fool. I might just check it out. I
don't want to send a tell over some mis named piece of gimp garbage I don't
recognize.
    b) Why can't you buy a trader satchel (and a clue) and list the item in
/bazaar???!
    c) Give me a freakin price when I ask. Don't go on about how nice it is.
I know how nice it is. Tell me how much you want me to pay. And when ask you
double the current bazaar price and I tell you to go kite the Avatar of War,
don't bitch at me for 10 min... my ignore list is full, and it takes a bit
for you to get high enough on the stupid meter to remove someone else.

5. The market is competitive. If I undercut you 4pp on the stein of moggok,
(mainly because I asked 325 and you wanted 329 because someone had them
listed at 330) don't scream at me. Neither of us is losing any money on
this. The price is twice what I used to be lucky to get in EC before the
bazaar came out.

6. At the same time, some of you are competitive jerks. WHY are you selling
jewelry for mere SILVER over what you can sell it to a merchant for? You'll
make money faster just grinding it onto a merchant somewhere. And don't get
me started on armor and food that you charge less than production cost for.
And screw you 1pp undercutters. I'll spend 5pp not to have to go to the
corners at the banks (where all you assholes live).

/rant off
