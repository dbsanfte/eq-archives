Normally I don't get into discussion of semantics, but this whole bug fix
vs. nerf argument interests me.

From a programming perspective, a "bug" is a mistake in the way the code is
written that manifests itself in an unexpected event within the program.
These events include things like output of incorrect data, failure to
respond to a command, giving an incorrect response to a command, or in the
worst case crashing the program. "Bugs" do not include the end user doing
things with the program that the designer or programmer did not intend. Bugs
are not caused by nor affected by the end user at all. Bugs are simply
coding errors.

There is no coding error in KEI. The code for KEI works *exactly* as it was
written with no errors. The fact that end users can cast the spell on lower
level group members was written into the code, for better or worse. If the
game designers intended for KEI only to be cast on 50+ level characters but
did not instruct the programmers to write code preventing it (or failed to
check that such code was written) it is still not a bug. It's a design flaw.

KEI is not bugged, therefore any change to KEI cannot be called a bug fix.

Changes to game design that lessen the effectiveness of a character, item,
or spell are called "balancing" by game engineers and "nerfs" by players
affected.
