Roughly 50% of your investment.

If you were on Firiona Vie, you could sell it to another player and reap 
as much as 90% of your investment... in fact there are some enterprising 
drogmar traders who buy em and resell em to people who don't have LOY 
for More than cost.  IF you don't mind the extremely crappy (instead of 
merely crappy, for a horse) movement of a drogmar, they allow much 
easier targetting and looting.
