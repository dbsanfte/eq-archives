Depends on the group and the people involved.  WIth decent gear, 
paladins and SK have nearly as many HP and as much AC, but grab aggro 
earlier and more solidly, which means the mob can be slowed earlier 
(less healing of the MT needed) and concentrates better on the MT (less 
healing of other group members needed).  After the current patch this 
may change, but currently, warrior tends to mean -more- healing, not 
less, is needed.  And paladins and SK bring lots to the table besides 
the ability to MT, while warriors... do not.

  Necros can do so much in a group

Debuffs are largely useless in grouping.  Steal mana is nice.  Mezz, 
yes, but only in small overpulls, which are generally not a problem, its 
massive overpulls that CC is really needed for.  Slow undead is nice... 
in the relatively rare group where you are fighting exclusively undead. 
  Snare, lots of other classes can do, and necro/SK do it in a less 
useful way than rangers and druids; the DOT component means more 
resists, the duration is short and the snare itself doesn't slow down 
the mobs as much.  DoTs are NOT desirable in groups, although the very 
short duration ones aren't as terrible as the long duration stuff.  Off 
tanking with pet... 90% of classes in the game can off tank, either 
themselves or with a pet... wizards are the only one that comes to mind 
that can't.  Spot heal, only 6 other classes that can do that.  Rez, 
sure, at 300pp a shot for a rez thats barely better than pally rez and 
worse than cleric rez... *(not that it matters much, the main objection 
is the 300pp cost)  Not that necroes are a bad class, thats a lot of 
utility in one package, and flexibility is its own reward in some cases, 
but its not the end all be all you seem to be describing.

Druids add DS, regen, HP buffs, heals, dots, snares

But mages offer better DS, shaman better regen, clerics better HP buffs, 
clerics better heals, shaman more heals in the long run, Dots... bad 
news, snares, nice but common, nukes, not as good as mage, wizard or 
even necro nukes.  Flexibility is nice as I noted, but this package 
doesn't put you at the 130 list point either.

  Shaman are much more desirable than BLs in my opinion with
> better buffs, heals, and amazing debuffs. 

Shaman often go searching for a role to play, other than slow bitch, in 
a full group their DPS is towards the low end, and their other abilities 
are often taken care of by other people in the group.  Beastlords, on 
the other hand, offer mana regen not offered by any other class in the 
game, and superlative DPS

  To put Rangers above Paladins,
> SKs and warriors is interesting, to say the least. 

This one is a bit of an oddity, but I assume its build around the high 
end of the game where rangers can pull in some very impressive DPS.  DPS 
means you can have more than one of a class and still get full benefit. 
  ANY class who works best as a MT has to suffer compared to DPS 
classes, which stack well.  But above warriors is a no brainer, 
practically any class can be put above warrior, since they serve best as 
tanks but are the worst of the three tank classes for that job.  Only 
class that might be less desirable would be post nerf monk, with no role 
at all to play.

  I still see monks

Being willing to take any class is one thing, but trying to claim they 
are all equally useful is another.  I can eat a burger or sushi or some 
beans, but there's certainly one I'd rather eat than the others, and one 
i'd least like to see as my evening meal.

Splendid
