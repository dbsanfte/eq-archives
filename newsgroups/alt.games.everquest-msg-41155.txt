Because THAT was a deliberate attack by one GOVERNMENT against another. 
In THIS case, it is a band of individuals NOT a government that has 
committed these attacks. I have no doubt that our government will 
retaliate. As a matter of fact I'm certain. I just hope and pray that it 
is handled better than before. Sending 75 missiles in HOPE of getting 
the right guy is completely wrong in my opinion. I'd like to see an 
operation to apprehend those responsible. If Afghanistan (who is most 
likely the guilty party in this case) does not hand over the guilty 
after we have the proof, I believe then we should declare war and force 
them from power.
