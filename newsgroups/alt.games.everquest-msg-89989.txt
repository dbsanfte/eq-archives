If you're fighting in an outdoor zone, make one person the
designated "OH SHIT" person.  If _that person only_ calls
"Run," then run.  It's not much good in dungeons, but
outdoors with SoW and such running away is almost as
good as an evac.

Except Maiden's Eye...screenshots of 15-20 level 53+ mobs
hanging out at the zone-in are scary...I almost poop every time
I zone in there with ANY character, no matter what time of
day/night :-).
