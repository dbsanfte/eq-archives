My lvl 32 Bard was in NK at the gypsy camp, calling out for a bind.  A nice
HE Mage said he'd come by and bind me.  While waiting, I decided to kill a
scarab that crossed my path, just to kill time while waiting.  During my
battle, the Mage ran up to me and said he'd wait for me to finish killing
the scarab before he bound me.  "Thank you", I said.

Next thing I know, I had lost total control over my keyboard and mouse.  My
Bard was running toward the Mage, striking at him and his pet.  After a
minute, the poor little Mage and his pet were both dead, at my hands.  My
Bard continued to run around wildly, killing another gypsy and then finally
settling on the ground near the gypsy camp.  After a couple more minutes I
get a message, "You begin to feel like yourself".  At that point I had
control over my mouse and keyboard again.  I asked the Mage, "What
happened"?  He replied, "You KILLED me!!!"

I apologized and tried to explain that I had no control over myself!

Here's my question;  Why did this happen?  Was the HE Magician kos to the
Enchanter Gypsy?  She obviously didn't want to harm ME, or I would have died
as well.  Did my battle with the scarab have anything to do with provoking
this?  I'm clueless.

Thanks,

Liat
32nd Bard
