Sarnak Toffee (battle) Hammer as I think I said in this thread, dunno...it's
old any that's 30/40 2hb <1k

Yesterday I bought my friend Felhammer 34/46 2hs proc smite.
I have one myself, had it for about 6months cost me about 7.5k...which was
good at the time. Yesterday I payed 700pp!!! ...this isn't the norm, I
admit...2 - 3k is closer to it on BB but still
700pp for what was (and still is) my Warriors Pride and Joy, nothing quite
like the feeling, at 51st, of stealing aggro off a 58th Warrior wielding 2
lammy's when Felhammer goes on a proc spree...of course such an event could
get you killed in the wrong place, still...
