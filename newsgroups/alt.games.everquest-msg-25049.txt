}> Well, golly gee willakers... (however that last word is supposed to be
}> spelled)
}1 L, 2 I's and a C, I think.  That's why I prefer "Golly, Beav" instead.
}Easier to spell.

I could find no listing for it with any spelling at m-w.com.  So I ran an 
experiment.  Go to Altavista, and do a search for +gee +whillikers.  The 
numbers of pages returned for various spellings follows:

Wilakers: 1
Willakers: 18
Whillakers: 8
Whilikers: 29
Whillikers: 107
Whilicers: 0
Wilicers: 0
Whillicers: 0
Willicers: 0
Whilacers: 0
Wilacers: 0
Whillacers: 0
Willacers: 0

I conclude that Whillikers is probably the most right.  

Damn.  I could have spent that time playing EQ.  Ah well. :)
