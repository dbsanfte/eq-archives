Pretty sure the BP is his common drop. 

BTW, there's one more named in range of that camp, PH a massive (?)
golem that spawns outside the door. Not doable with a duo but pretty
easy to clear the building and 2 golems if you have 4 or 5 people.

I've seen 2 belts drop in maybe 12 hours there, and probably twice as
many shields. Agreed though that it's not a great money camp, if
you're in that far, there's better spots for cash loot in veksar <g>.

Did you have better luck camping Fellspine? In close to 10 hours at
that camp, I've never seen him spawn.
