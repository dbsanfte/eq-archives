In general I've heard necros do better solo than others.  

I've heard Magician mentioned as a possible solo class too, but the
downtime at the start of each session to summon all the junk you need
can be bad if you only have a short time to play each session.  

Shamans can solo somewhat.  Enchanters can solo in some places if they
use the right techniques.  I even heard of a warrior once that soloed to
above 50, though it must have been painful because of the downtime.  

My wife soloed her wizard through most of the last 5 levels and I was
surprised how well it worked for her.  She just found locations where
she could camp single spawns, then went afk during the med time between
spawns.  

It all comes down to what you will enjoy.  If you want to see a lot of
the world or port others you might want to consider a druid.  If you
want solo efficiency go with a necro.  If you're hooked on some other
class, most can solo to one extent or another, especially at lower
levels.
