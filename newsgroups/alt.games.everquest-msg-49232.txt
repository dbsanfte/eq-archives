Combat skills (your weapon skill, offense, defense, and at 15 Dodge) will
all go up reasonably well while power leveling.   You are correct in that
your spell casting skills will not... but incorrect in thinking that you'll have

to fight blues to raise those skills later.  Spell casting skills go up strictly

from casting spells, no target needed.  So you can sit somewhere in
complete safety and raise those skills by a little drudgery... I prefer the
docks
while waiting on a boat for this, as I'll get my mana back during the
boat ride.

A level 22 druid is, by the way, not going to be able to work miracles
on you...yes, you'll level up a little faster than you would alone, perhaps,
but he's not -that- far ahead.  In fact when you hit 15 you'll be able
to group with him and both get exp.

This is certainly true, and its a serious danger.  You just hit 14... got a new
stack of spells you could be figuring out.  Play porcupine and you need
only figure out how to do that... try, at level 60, finding a level 90 to PL
you!

yep, in moderation, PLing can give you a leg up to be able to group with
friends who've left you behind... but overused, its more of a curse
