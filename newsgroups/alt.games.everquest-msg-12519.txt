I am going on for my 4th time ever tonite, (writing from work), and I am
*addicted*! Last night, by the west gate of Freeport, I hooked up with a kind
bard who was extremely helpful! A few people have given me a bit or two of
armor, some PP etc. It is a very kind, very cool community and I am already
enjoying my self immensely! Thanks! (Any help etc. appreciated. Look for Jenda
by the west gate or south gate in Freeport after 7 PM EST tonite!!!) Though I am
meeting with my Bardic compatriot at 9pm...

Thanks all!

Jeff (Jenda)
