I have killed several, actually, but its a cherry picking operation, there's
only one in each village that's an appropriate level, and spawn times are
pretty low, so I kill em when I'm passing thru and then move on.  I was
thinking of going in to Halas to hunt on the theory that there would be
a lot more Barbies in any given level range.

Hmm, Millers farm, what are the levels there?  I know eventually the
miller siblings in QH will open up, see them hunted quite frequently.

Now see one zone I really dislike hunting in is TD: in order to nerf the
firepots
they made the entire zone unbindable, which means every time you die you need
to wait average of 15 minutes for a raft, then swim halfway across a fairly huge

zone to get to your body.  Sure, melee classes are all playing the world's
tiniest
violin over this, but I mostly play bind capable characters and part of the
reason
is that I don't find spending half an hour running across various zones naked
all that amusing, been there done that.

MMMM, positive CB faction, didn't know that was possible.  Orcs

hehe, the cuter the better.  At very low levels, I hunted snow bunnies
