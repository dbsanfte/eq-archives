Quoted from an internal memo:

"Despite your well thought out request, we decided against hiring
testers to put the EverQuest patches through their paces, however we
heard about this piece of software we thought you might like.  It's
something called a 'spell checker.'  We thought it might help with these
stacking problems that you keep having.  Let us know what you think.

-Management"
