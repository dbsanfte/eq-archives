I only have one account, so running two copies has never been an issue.
ALT-ENTER, and ALT-TAB were both working flawlessly for me after the patch.
I would guess that there are either issues with some versions of windows, or
with some drivers.  Did not run into any other problems post patch either,
overall, quite happy with it.  All that being said, I can't disagree that
they should have considered EQW as an option, rather than reimplement the
wheel.
