   Which items don't go poof! when you give them to mobs?

   I know that money goes poof?  At least it did the last time I gave a
few coppers to a spiderling.  
   (Would the money have still been there if it had been a skeleton?)

   I also know that the last time I gave a spider a weapon or a skeleton
a bag, they still had it when I killed them. 

   If bags don't go poof! and there contents don't go poof!, do the
contents remain in the bag or are they displayed as separate items when
looting?

   (I'm thinking of setting up some kind of quests for newbies to get
some nice things for there level but don't want a Bronze Weapon, or
Flowing Black Robe, or a bag full of bone chips, or a bag full of bat
wings to go poof! when I give them to a YK or Giant Spider.)

   I know I can test this myself, but it would be a less expensive
lesson to learn it from others experiences.
