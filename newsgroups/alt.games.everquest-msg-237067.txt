Forget the "Sewers are for Elemental geared people" BS.

A group of players that have never even gotten to the
Tower of What's-his-name Ro can XP in the Purifying
plant sewer with ease.  They can also beat the boss mob
and get flagged for the next trial.

The other trials had lackluster XP, but we were getting
~2.5% of an AA per mob in the front room of PP.  There
are 11 mobs on a ~20minute timer on the top ledge, 2
roamers in the water, and a couple in the center.  More
than enough to keep you busy (with only 2 during our
pull cycle that needed pacify to split).

Considering you can get this zone to yourself by simply
walking up to Gamesh and saying "Plant", it's my new
favorite AA grinding spot I think.
