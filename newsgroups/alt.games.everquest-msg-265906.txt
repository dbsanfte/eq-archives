A summoner has the ability to animate and control
something, whether that is elemental matter or the
dead.   The "good" path is to use elements; the
"evil" path is to use the dead.   It's not so much
that using elements means you're "good" as it is
that you're not using the dead...

The alignment makes one assumption -- the "evil"
summoner would choose to use that "animate and
control" ability with the dead rather than be only
"partly evil."  *shrug*
