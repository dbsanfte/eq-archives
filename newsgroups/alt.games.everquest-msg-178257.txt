Well, there are a few new developments worth reporting in the saga of my 
crap computer...

The purchase of a heatsink and fan combo the size of a VW Camper, and 
some breathtakingly expensive thermal goop (this time scientifically 
applied according to the instructions) conspicuously failed to address 
the locking-up problem. The CPU temperature remains a resolute 51 
degrees, with seems a bit high with such amounts of cooling firepower 
available, but hey... BTW, the CPU is correctly identified by the BIOS, 
and fed the customary 1.73 Volts.

So I tried a small experiment. I clocked down the CPU to 100Mhz and kept 
the memory bus at 133. The computer obligingly locked up. I removed one 
of the memory sticks, fired up a 3D-intensive game and got playing for a 
while. No lockups. BINGO! I thought... Dodgy memory stick. So I set the 
CPU back to 133Mhz and tried the experiment again...

And yes, lockup. Although this time it took about ten minutes of 
intensive gameplay for it to happen. >:-(

So, what conclusions can I reach from this new available info, besides 
"this fucking sucks"?
