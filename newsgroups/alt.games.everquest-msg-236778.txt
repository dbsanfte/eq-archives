Well, that's why we invented the expression "put up or shut up" :)

And that's why Sherlock Holmes said that once you have discarded the 
impossible, what's left, however improbable, must be the truth. If you 
saw a giant stick coming from the sky and slowly homing in on your 
eyeball, I recommend checking the bottom of your glass for telltale 
residue.

I think the issue has been turned around... the issue is not disbelief 
in the presence of proof, but belief despite the absence of such. As far 
as I'm concerned "do not multiply entities unnecessarily" -the venerable 
Occam's Razor- are words to live by.

You do have a penchant for playing Devil's Advocate. :)
