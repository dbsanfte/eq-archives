I used to find Velks boring, sit in one place and someone brings you the 
mobs, gets real old since the mobs are all basically the same.

Then I started playing there with my bard, roaming around and learning 
the place, a lot more fun, although not well suited to a bard's strengths.

Then I took my mage there, at first with a shaman partner or any small 
group I could find, and then later solo, and loved it.  Key was, we 
didn't sit in one place, even though it might have been better to do so, 
instead we roamed around picking fights where we found them.  Its a 
weird three dimensional maze with lots of tricky footing, slippery 
spots, mobs hiding around corners... great sport.

Also, made a small fortune looting all the velium bricks and blocks into 
summoned bags, they retail for 25pp very fast (probably because most 
people seem to sell them at 50pp) and quite a few will drop in an 
evenings' wandering.

Kobolds in Velks is a fun camp too, with some drops, and then there are 
the golems, but I'm not familiar with that part, only done them in raid 
mode taking out Velks himself or... whoever that other guy is  in there.
