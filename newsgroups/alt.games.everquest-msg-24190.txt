That may be true but if I'm grouped with a warrior with his taunt maxed out,
and he is using it like he should, if he can't taunt the mob off me while he
is swinging his heart out with his wormslayer or what ever, then you can be
damn sure I'm doing more dam than he is.

On a side note, I know that I'm not the only one that doesn't like to group
with rogues, simply cause they frequently steal loot before the mob is dead,
practicing their pickpocket skill. And as far as I'm concerned that's
stealing from me. I wish verant would make a successful pickpocket attempt
give the group a message like a successful attempt at baking or sewing or
what ever.

Now, before I get flamed , let me just say I know some rogues don't steal
from their groups, but a lot do. So if your a "good" rogue don't whine to me
about how you never steal from your group members.
