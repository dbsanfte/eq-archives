Hey Freeman, and others, great post(s).
   To explain the whole healing / warrior thing:
The cleric I grouped with used Xylobot.  I had hotkeys set up to chat into a
channel that would trigger a heal or any other spell he had memorized.  He
never watched his own screen.  I was the tank and I had to heal myself by
calling the heals to the chat with my hotkeys- not that this is Not cool, it
is VERY cool, but after a long time of doing it, it gets seriously old, and
boring like I said. keep in mind I had no other access to this cleric, so
wherever he sat down was where he sat for the duration, and you couldn't
make him move or anything without a follow command and such.

   The person I was grouped with was a long time acquaintence/friend, but
every time I grouped with him I would realize more and more how much his
groups sucked, compared to any other group I was in, and I was only
tolerating such sh*t because he was an old friend.  I couldn't take it any
more after he kept trying to explain stuff as I was doing it right already
and tease me constantly (he's a strange type of person for that, nothing he
ever said was uplifting, ever, even before we grouped).  We used teamspeak
(www.teamspeak.org) to communicate and he was really annoying in that over
the voice communications with his nagging and such.

  Anyway, thanks for your posts - it helps me understand boxers a lot
better, but still no 4-boxers have posted, heh.
I love grouping with the occasional two-boxer, they can handle their jobs
well enough - only notice a minor difference from a normal player, that
could be discounted as a distracted player, which is exactly what they are
anyway hehe.
