Yeah, because nobody bother to stick with the game before.  In the
last THREE YEARS!

One of the things that makes EQ addictive is the fact that it's
difficult.  That it takes work to advance.  The only thing that making
the first 10 levels easier is going to do is make make people quit
when the hard, cold reality that the game takes some serious effort to
play hits home with a vengance at level 11.  My money says that breaks
more people than corpse runs would have.
