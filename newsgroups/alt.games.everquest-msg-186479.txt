I don't know about the arguments, but definitely I disagree about the XP. 
I think that the insane XP in PoP saved me from quitting the game at 57... 
500+ blue kills per level is just not on.

Then again, it looks like it's back to about that much for levels 61-65, 
which is why I'm in no hurry at all to log back in until I polish off my 
backlog of single-player games. :/
