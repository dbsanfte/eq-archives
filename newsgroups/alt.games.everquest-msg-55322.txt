    It's nice to hear that some players will take the time to make a
sale/trade a pleasant experience, rather than a "can u trade me ur weapon
PLZ?"

    On my server, the 150 plat would buy a Bloodclaw outright. So you are
getting the better of the deal.

    The Bloodclaw starts to proc at 18, by which point you'll likely be
looking for a main hand item with some INT/MANA on it. Given you can always
range-slot the Dragoon for the MR until you find a better range slot item
once you get that better main hand item, you're coming out way ahead from a
"personal use" perspective. Since the Dragoon Dirk is used for a quest, it
should hold value better than the Bloodclaw, too. It can also be used by
more classes.

    So you have a weapon that's slightly better (for you) than what you had,
and all the goodness of a Stein, and spell money for next spell level.
Jakugg, you did quite well. The reason you don't see a Bloodclaw sell in EC
often is because it's a very limited-audience weapon, with damage/delay the
same as a cheap, plentiful item (Dragoon). The proc doesn't go off until
level 18, so it isn't a hot twink item, and it drops off a PITA mob in an
out-of-the-way dungeon. So nobody farms it. I remember my rogue and how much
fun she had with hers (our group of friends called out procs, so we'd all
/gsay BLOODCLAW! a lot), but with every rogue twink pretty much issued a
Walrus Tooth at birth?
