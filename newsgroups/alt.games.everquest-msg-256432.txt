Find a caster with the pet hold AA and go to town. The held pet won't attack
and you can poke at it all dsy with the caster throwing a heal now and then.

I'll be honest, at 54 my mage has a piercing of oh about 20. As the levels
get higher there is no reason for a dress wearer to worry about their melee
skills. If you can't take it out with spells you WON'T take it out melee and
will probably be dead anyway if gate fails.
