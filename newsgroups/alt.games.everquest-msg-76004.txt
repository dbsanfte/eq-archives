apples and oranges in levels, but 45 took 2 days, 4 hours each day,
and 46 and 47 both went down in less than 3 hours each... quad kiting
is nice, and sometimes is a skill I wish I could do, but it is hard to
beat a JBB and root combo for exp... total mana expendature of no more
than 300 per kill, with a mana pool of well over 2k...  and that is
factoring in taking blue, even and yellow cons.... I still refuse to
mess with red cons at this point solo..... too much risk, too little
reward.


but in comparison, still better than a mage or necro, which were the
topic of conversation
