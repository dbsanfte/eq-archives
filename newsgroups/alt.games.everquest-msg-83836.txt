Shrug.  I think Tim has made enough of a contribution to the AGE community 
that he's entitled to post about how Mythic handled a bad situation.  Had 
he said "Mythic pwns, Verant suxx0rs" I would have slammed him too.  
Had he not made it very clear that he was contrasting the way that Mythic 
handled a problem with the way that Verant handled similar problems, I 
would have slammed him.  
Why is it that when someone asked how EQ compares to Diablo2 nobody flies 
off the handle, but when a respected poster, with a long history here 
posts something that may indicate that a competitor handled a situation in 
a different manner, it's open season on him?  What if he had said that 
Mythic's rollout of DAoC was the smoothest roll-out of an MMORPG to date, 
and that Verant could have learned something from them, especially after 
the problems with SoL?  Would that be a true statement, would that invite 
flames and profanity?
