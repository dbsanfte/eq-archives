    Very sorry to see that one fixed, since it also fixed the massively
bugged bows with throwing ammo issue. Bows were able to fire throwing stuff,
with damage and delay figured by adding the damages and delays of the two

so both times by exploiting this with their rangers. Heck, even our rogues
were getting Deadly Strikes in the 600 damage range.
