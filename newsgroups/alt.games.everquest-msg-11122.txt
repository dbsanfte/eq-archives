5 of our 12 warriors already have there lightsabre . All of the other 7 have
the green scale . Wuoshi also drops it btw . we have 3 missing  spiroc lord
blade due to absence at sky raid for them . None of the seven missing epic
have queen blade (all of us hate chardok with a passion so this is the
holdup ) . we are still missing a fair number of golem balls - we pretty
much have abandoned hate and fear . Spend alot of time in tov, kael , growth
and killing the uber mobs in the spawn spots, other than that just straight
exps for slacker mains or twinks . What probably makes it hard for you to
get green scale is that the poison dragons are the easiest to kill :p
