Heh.  We got three silk robes on our last trip to ToV.  We're on
Kael faction, however, and don't do HoT.  I think the next one that
drops goes to the guild bank for one of our CoV-faction mages
since all the regular casters have ToV and/or better.

Drop rates in HoT are horrible, from what I've heard.
