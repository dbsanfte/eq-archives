I too wanted to build the ultimate Everquest box but my budget was a
bit higher.

One point, whether we like it or not it appears that Verant is going
to be optimizing for P4 chips.  You may consider getting one of those
rather than the Athalon.

The other philosophy I had was getting the most stable system I can. 
Who cares if you get 60fps at 1600x1200 if you crash during a Naggy
raid.

Here is my system:

Intel 845D mobo
P4 1.9ghz processor
2x512 DDR Ram
Verto GeForce3 Ti 500
80gb Western Digital hard drive
CD-RW drive (generic)
Sony G520 21" monitor
Liam Li case (the fancy one from Sharky)
350 watt power supply
Turtle Beach Santa Cruz audio
3.5" floppy
some other stuff I forget

The total price was in the $2500 range but you can cut the price
significantly with a drop in the monitor and the case.  Probably next
cut would be the video card.  I imagine you can build a very
respectible P4 system for under 1k.

Just a thought.
