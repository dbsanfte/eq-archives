Been Running with a standard layout on my current shammy. This is my second
time trying the class (played one to 35 on brell about a year and a half
ago ). Sgok Kokoro just hit 30 about 2 days ago and for the bulk of my
levels I have run solo with the following line-up.

DD
Poision Dot
Disease Dot
Debuff
Root
Regen/Quickness- (I swap these two since they seem to fade about the same
time)
Heal
Canni


I have used this pattern for quite a while and it seems to allow me enough
to keep alive!
