The other day in the Oasis I had formed up a full group and we were on
the orc highway.  Our tank, lvl 14 fighter, was simply not tanking.
He was standing by us, and occasionally he would attack a mob but
mainly he was sending out /oocs and chatting with his friends.
Another group tried pulling too close to our group and we quickly had
a large amount of orcs on top of us, and he was still doing his /ooc
and not paying attention to the fight.  I tried to tank (15 beastlord)
but without taunt I really can't pull aggro.  We were doing okay and
would have been fine if except the orcs went aggro on the cleric and I
couldn't pull them off (even with flash of light) and neither could
our backstabbing rogue.  Led to a total party wipeout, with the non
tanking warrior dying last (he actually had full health until everyone
else died).  Even if he wasn't able to pull off the aggro just him
fighting should have helped enough to stand up to it.  When everyone
made it back (minus him) I /sent to everyone saying vote to kick
blahblah.  Everyone said yes, and one person actually said if he
wasn't good and was trying then I'd want to keep him but he just stood
there and watched us die...so we ended up just kicking him and
replaceing him with someone who actually wanted a group to play with.
Didn't hear anything from him until a little later we hear him asking
for help leveling, sitll naked since he hadn't got his corpse.  Like 2
days later I found him in Freeport begging for equiptment, but it
looked like he found his corpse
