Interesting.  I wonder if there's a legal precedent for 'has control over' 
being distinct from 'ownership'.

*Shrug* It might not be, if, for example, you left a note.  Or if the 
person rifling through the till were an employee handling his own refund 
in accordance with store policy.  But that's largely irrelevant, since 
there is no register, and the person involved didn't take the money out, 
Paypal did.

That would depend on whether the credit card company recognized 
transactions involving virtual property as legitimate, now, wouldn't it?  
Of course, they wouldn't allow a theft to be committed, but they may have 
their own ideas about whether this is, in fact, a theft.  They may have 
their own ideas about whether a service was, in fact, performed, and 
whether the items exchanged do have value, and whether that value is the 
property of the person selling to legitimately exchange.  Until a court 
actually sets a precedent, they'll probably act in accordance with their 
own ideas, too.  GoM entered into an agreement with Paypal, having full 
access to reviewing their policies in these matters, and probably was even 
required to agree with those policies.  It's a bit late to complain that 
these policies didn't work out for them the way they'd hoped.

You expect to find worthy opponents on USENET? :)
