Hi just started 2 boxing now that I have repaired an old computer. Use a Pally
and a Druid.
Not so much worried aboput class combo's as that has been argued over many
times. More interested in practical tips for getting the best out of the
system, et up, etc.
Finding life a liitle more difficult with two keybpards and two mice .
