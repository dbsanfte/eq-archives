I am thinking of getting into the EverQuest thing, but I have a few
questions that maybe one (or more) of you can answer...

Do I have to buy a set of software for every player in the family if we have
multiple computers (4) in the house?

If I can install the software on every computer in the house, can I create
different accounts on each computer?  Can I create multiple accounts on the
same computer?

Do I have to install all the expansion packs (I think it comes in a trilogy)
in order to install 'Shadows of Luclin'?

Thanks for the advise in advance....hope to see you all online...
 - Jon
