I am getting a lot of great information here.  Thank you all.  The reason I
would like to downgrade is because I have found there are many programs out
there that are NOT winME compatible.  That is why I want to downgrade to
win98.  The other computer is a 633 i dont remember if its p2 or p3.  Maybe
its just not worth the time and effort to reformat.  It would be an awesome
and frustrating experience and then I would know all my programs would work.
Anyways, if Im wrong please let me know.  Which im sure you all will.  :)

Sheri  :)
