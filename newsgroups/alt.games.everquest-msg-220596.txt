Which are (well, were back when people did the cycle) there
because a tracker ran out and pulled them to the slaughter
group.  Did you think those bodies just spawned on their own?

Just because the tracker responsible for those mobs being found
isn't grouped with you doesn't mean he wasn't important in
bringing them in and getting them killed.

That said, I think my bard could get a seb key without using his
track skill, just invis and high speed selo around the zone till
he stumbles across a hunter, kill that, then a forager, kill
that.  It would however take about 10 times as long and be quite
annoying, since there are soooo many frogloks there and the
terrain is hilly and full of trees, making "mark one eyeball"
tracking particularly tiresome.
