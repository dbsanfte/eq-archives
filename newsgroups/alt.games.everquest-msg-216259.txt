Unless a necro has a mid-high level enchanter, he likely REALLY sucks doing
crowd control due to lack of exposure.  Just because you get a mezz doesn't
mean you know what to do with it (heaven forbid they ask me for advice :p ).
The three high level necros I've grouped with died a LOT more than my
enchanter.

Good druids (non-dr00ds) are great at ghetto mezz (root) and there's almost
always enough room to do this in LDON.  Typically this does require the
puller to pull into the previous large-ish room, but there's lots of those.
Good wizards are great at CC too but of course they aren't nearly as
well-rounded as druids.

Casters haven't been much of an issue, except the healers.  Caster nukes are
pretty weak, even when it gets past your resist check.

Bard tracking in LDON is almost always good enough...in fact, probably
better than druid since it only gets the very closest critters.  I think
that the caps are quite different though.  I know that druid is at 125...I
THINK bard is at 50ish.
