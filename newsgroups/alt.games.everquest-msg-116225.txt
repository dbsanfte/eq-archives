I do have DA, but didn't until 60, seahorses see invis, and I'm not 
planning on sticking around long enough for slow or snare to matter.  I've 
got speed and that's all that matters.  Back before the long-lasting Selos 
I learned to carry SoW potions.  And to distract the seahorses if 
possible.  I was crossing SG at 49, and hunting there with my guild at 51, 
before it was nerfed.  It was tough to cross it solo, but there really 
wasn't much need to do so, and when there was, I figured out how to move 
the two seahorses.

Clerics die in SG waaaayy do much for a class with 2 invunerable spells.

If you're a 54 mage, what in the hell are you trying to cross SG alone for 
anyway?  You planning on soloing wurms in WW or something?  Hell, you 
aren't even a CoH whore at this point, so you've almost got to either be 
part of a raid or a crafty mage who could probably figure out a way to 
sacrifice a pet to get the seahorses out of the way for the 3 seconds it 
takes to swim past them.
