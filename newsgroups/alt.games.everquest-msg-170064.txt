}Tash is a poison spell.  I'd expect it to fall under affliction.  I

}(at least mine don't) same with the other debuffs.

Well... I couldn't find a group tonight, so I took the hint.  I grabbed 
some kobold-hide boots (Ext.Aff.II) and a polished bone bracelet 
(Aff.Eff.I) from my necro and went up to netherbian to play around a bit.  

Conclusion:  Tash, slow, weaken line, and cripple line are afflictions. 
Oh, and charm and root worked for me too.  Mez and stuns are not  
afflictions.  I just may have to look into some nice affliction focus 
items after all. :)

Then, since I saw some other folks discussing it somewhere, I gave my 
mage's summoning efficiency item (Embroidered Black Sleeves) to my necro.  
It does -not- work with necro pets, so that new item in PoN that's nec 
only really is totally useless.  Damn.

My lovely page has been updated accordingly, and I added some of the items 
from PoK quests.  I'll have to get to the rest of PoP later. :)
