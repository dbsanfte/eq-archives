Just for kicks I tried searching for 'ati problem everquest'
rather than 'radeon'. After all, your terms of search were
for Nvidia the company, not a particular product or brand
of theirs.

ati problem everquest: 1,210 results.

Thanks.

Searching solely in alt.games.everquest:

ATI: 873
Nvidia: 917

So. It seems about even to me. 

I wonder how many hits I'd get if I searched for 'idiotic stalkers
of dark tyger problem'.
