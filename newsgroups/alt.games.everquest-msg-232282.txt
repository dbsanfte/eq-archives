Ahh... I thought it was about the 'cyberphobe' bit.  Gibson has actually 
said that he was one back then, which made the comparison a bit odd.  
Eventually, after he had a few books out, his fans convinced him to get a 
mac.  A friend of mine actually ended up exchanging email for a bit with 
him a couple years ago.  Apparently he was hooked on eBay. :)
