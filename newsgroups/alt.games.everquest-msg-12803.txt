Go smash pretty much any beetle about ;) Fire beetles drop
them most frequently but you'll find scarabs, and so forth on faydwer
sometimes do too. Bizzare, but true ;)

You'll still have that eye at 52, too. One of your longest lasting
pieces of equipment.

It gets a bit... icky... .grubby by then though. Sort of... squishy.
