I have used it recently and can confirm the above - the slam (not bash)
button has to be set up every time you logon, and isn't even available
to set up until you acquire the skill by casting your illusion. Once set
up, the button will remain even when your illusion fades, although it
will cease to be a pushable button - doesn't grey out or anything, just
stops working. When you reapply your illusion your button starts working
again. Its gone completely the next time you logon.
