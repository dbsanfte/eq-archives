Don't know if it's true, but someone said that you also lose zone 
bonuses.

If the classes present would allow for it, the best bet would be to split 
into two partial groups, you can still fight in the same area, and help 
each other out when needed.  Also, keep in mind that the group bonus is 
actually larger than 80% for a full group, it's 116% as I recall.  The 
6th person added to a group is free, in effect adding another 36% xp 
bonus.

That makes it 100/216 = 46.2%

So, even ignoring the possible zone bonus loss.

Given 14 mobs that yields 1000xp each, and 7 people.

The raid gets 14000xp total, divided among the 7 people.

Raid = 14*1000/7 = 2000xp per person.

With the rotation, each person participates in killing only 12 of the 14 
mobs, but the total xp is only divided among 5 of the 6 members of the 
group, and is multiplied by the full group bonus of 1.8.

Rotating = (14-2)*1000/5*1.8 = 4320xp per person.

So, works out to the 6 person group bonus, of 116% more xp, which by an 
amazing coincidence is the full group bonus...

Basically, you'd get less than half the xp from the exact same mobs doing 
it as a 7 person raid vs rotating the group.

In other words, SoE highly encourages you to get a full 6 person group, 
no more, no less, for maximum xp.  If you have more, you are SOL xp-wise.
