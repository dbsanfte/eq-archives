Had someone come up to my then 4th level Dwarf Paladin, offer me some pp,
and some nifty items in return for holding all his stuff, and transferring
the stuff his other character could use back to him.  I am not in a guild,
had not been playing long, had no rep good or bad.  I did give him back
everything he wanted, and ended up with a boatload of decent armor, and some
extra pp.
