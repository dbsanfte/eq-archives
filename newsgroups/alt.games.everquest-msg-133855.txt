Yeah, that's me, and I still haven't figured out what I want to do in
the game! ;-) Heck, most of my alts aren't even level 20! It seems
like each class has something that I enjoy about it (don't really have
much experience with paladins, rogues, magicians or SKs, though) so
it's still hard for me to decide.

I have a number of different characters sprawled out over several
different servers.  My highest level character is a 31 Iksar monk
which I think is real fun to play.  However, I've exclusively soloed
with her, and I know I will probably have to start grouping eventually
(maybe not, but that seems to be the impression I get, that the higher
level you get, the harder it is to solo).  And it seems like monks are
usually the designated pullers, and frankly I think I suck at pulling
because I'm a real slowpoke who likes to take my time and the group
would probably get really impatient waiting for me to pull something.
I know the few times I've pulled for groups, on other characters
beside the monk, I would take forever!  So I haven't played my monk
for a while.  

Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but it also seems like when you get to
the high levels, you seem to have to spend more time playing, like if
you're doing things like raids and stuff, you can't just log in for an
hour and quit.  I have no idea how long an average raid lasts, but
just from what I've read here and other places, when you include
travel time, it sounds like it's usually at least several hours at a
time, probably more, and I don't have much time to play EQ nowadays.  

I recently started a DE necro which I also enjoy playing, and I almost
think that would be the ideal character for me to play given my
limited playing time.  (plus I would still be able to have FD with my
necro like I do with my monk, which is really nice).  And since necros
are such great soloers, I could then just log on for an hour and solo,
then quit.  I really don't like the idea of getting into a group and
then telling the group I can only stay on for so long, it wouldn't be
fair to the group.  Plus I personally enjoy soloing more than
grouping, partly because if I solo and screw up, then it's only me
that dies, but if I screw up in a group, the whole group might die and
I would feel really bad having that happen (of course, the opposite is
also true; I wouldn't be thrilled about my dying because another group
member screws up).

(I know druids are also good soloers and get cool things like SOW and
ports, but I think it would drive me nuts to get to a higher level and
be bugged for ports and stuff all the time.  It doesn't sound like
necros get swamped with tells asking them to summon corpses! :-) )

Speaking of which, I have a question for you folks who play
druids--does it seem like other players tend to treat druids like
dirt?  I've read this complaint by druids on message boards about how
since druids are supposed to be the most popular class to play because
they get the cool stuff like SOW and ports and because it's pretty
easy (especially a Halfling druid), they also have a larger share of
idiot players than other classes, and so some people fall for the
stereotype of the druid being a money-grubbing idiot drood looking for
phat loot who goes around pulling their quad kites on top of players
and getting people killed, and so it's almost like there's a stigma
attached to being a druid.  Am I correct in thinking this way? 

Anyway, sorry for rambling!
