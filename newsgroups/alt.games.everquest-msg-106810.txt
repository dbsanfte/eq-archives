Well any kind of soloing, Bard or not, gets more difficult
as you progress. However, fear kiting only requires 2 songs,
so you could get by with this on low blue non-MR mobs for
quite some time. If you get JBoots or TBoots, you can also
do DoT kiting outdoors using some combination of Fufil's
Curtailing Chant (30), Tuyen's Chant of Flame (38), and
Tuyen's Chant of Frost (46). Twisting 2 of these DoTs will
obviously be slower than using 3, but the mob should still
die eventually.

If you're willing to drop your grouping restriction, you can
probably get exp indefinitely since most groups just want
their Bard to play clarity song all the time anyway and
don't notice if you're not twisting anything else.
