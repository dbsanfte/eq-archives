Hmm I never had that trouble, crossed the bridge lots of times in Nek. I
guess if the Piranha had already aggro'd they would then ignore the bridge
like other mobs ignore buildings.
I just remember actually getting killed with DMF at 3rd lvl as I ran onto
the bridge for safety :ï¿½(
Took 3 attempts to get my corpse back. Nektolus seemed a dangerous place
when I was 3rd level.
It's happened a few times after that as well but at least then I was a
little higher and it wasn't so fatal.

Given that mobs can aggro thru buildings (Which can be really frustrating,
at low level, in places like NK) then I guess a bridge is no different, just
never had it without levitate.
