Hi everybody. 
  You don't know me but I know you guys. I have been playing EQ and
lurking here since release. Now I need some help with this mornings
problem. By the way, Played yesterday and a bit last night with no
problem. Went to bed and woke up with this one so I don't think it was
me  :)  
   I log on this morning with my druid, just hit 29 and was excited. I
camped in OT last night. I go to zone into FM and I get kicked back to
server select screen. No biggie, weird things happen sometimes in EQ.
So I try to go back to MT, (my server, after having switched from
prexus), and I get the annoying "you have an active character" message
and wait for the sync. When I do get back I go to my druid and launch
and behold, back to the server screen. I can no longer get to my
druid.
  So I go to my necro who was in EC. I go right to the FP zone line
and as I zone, once again, I get kicked back to server screen. Now I
can't play my necro either. I haven't tried any of my other characters
from fear of not being able to play them. End result is I can't zone!
  I ran the file checks on the patch screen for the regular start up
patch and the kunark patch. That didn't work. I sent a mail to VI
similar to this one but don't expect much help from them and god knows
I won't get anybody with a petition this early. I also recently
defragged my HD, about 10 days ago. It ran fine after so I don't think
it was that.
  System specs:
  P2 450   128 meg of ram  Sound Blaster PCI 128
  2 V2's running in SLI  20 gig HD with lots of free space
  DX 7a or whatever it was that they wanted us to upgrade to.

I'm sure that I am forgetting something but it's early  :)
Thanks in advance for any help I receive.
                           EQ Player  <--------  Goes back to lurking.

   53 Necro
   46 Rogue
   29 Druid
   Many more lvl 25 or less
