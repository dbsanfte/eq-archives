Specialization goes up slowly and it doesn't give you much benefit anyway.
The only time you really need to worry about it is if you've already put a
practice point in all 4 specializations (required before any can go over a
skill of 50) and you're worried that something will beat Evoc to 51.

Easiest to do in that case is to put practice points in, but if your wizzie
is like mine all the PPs are gone, spent on all the other skills that
wizards don't use that often (like, ALL of the others :) ).
