An update. Bengh, the tradeskill designer, took the time today to leave 
several responses in the thread I started on this topic. He's cleared up 
some of the confusion and speculation -- which is a very good thing -- and 
testers are now better able to move forward. I'll report on how I feel about 
the changes in a follow up post.
