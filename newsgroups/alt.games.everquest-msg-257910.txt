I have a method for making 20000 - 50000 plat an hour...

Step 1: Go get job at pizza delivery place or steak out or other 'group 
take out' delivering pizzas friday/sat, covering as much of 5-10 pm as 
you can
In wages tips in decent sized city you should average more than $20 an 
hour on a slow weekend.
Step 2: visit ige.com. order plat.
Much more reliable.

(When I was delivering pizza, Friday and Saturday night it was not 
uncommon for me to make $200-$300 in tips each night. Course I was 
within delivery distance of 2 colleges. Before EQ , but it paid for my 
books in college though. I showed a total lack of aptitude for the oven 
though, so they never put me on cooking. ^.^ )

(Yes I too dispise plat buyers, but I'd rather they buy plat than set 
their 65th level mage/necro/druid/whatever in my 50th level character's 
favorite hunting area and farm the entire zone.)
