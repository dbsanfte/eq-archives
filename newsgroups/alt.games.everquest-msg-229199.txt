The Lake of Ill Omen is pretty good. True, the ZEM was nerfed, but 
most of the baddies will be blue and white to you at twenty-five, 
gradually becoming cyan at twenty-eight or so. The loot can only be 
beat by Frontier Mountains, where the hill giants and other large 
monsters will con blue or yellow around twenty-eight to mid/late 
thirties (though you've got to be careful of adds, and some will con 
red to you for quite some time).

If you've got access to Luclin, head on over to Marus Seru until your 
low to mid-thirties. The low-quality rockhopper hides, greyhopper 
hides, and various words that drop sell for a pretty penny, and while 
the XP isn't great, it's a nice place for casual leveling (and 
occasional pick-up groups).

If you're in the mood for more of a dungeon, there are various places 
to go. Estate of Unrest is usually good for a group or two; Echo 
Caverns is a nice place to pick a fight (with a faction hit, but only 
in that zone). Guk is *possible*, but not suggested. Highpass is 
pretty good, but it's main detraction is that it's a long walk from 
just about anywhere; PoK portals are at least three or four zones 
away, which helps make it a slightly unpopular hunting zone.

South Karana's not bad, but not great; there seems to be a small 
disparity of when some mobs (like elephants) con green, and when 
others (like gnolls) con yellow. Wandering too close to the Splitpaw 
caves could mean a quick and messy death.

If you're in the mood for a (row)boat ride, try the Ocean of Tears. 
It takes a long time to get to the various isles without levitation, 
but in the level range you're talking about there are at least two 
islands that will con blue and yellow to you.

And, finally, if you can get a transport to Stonebrunt -- rather than 
going through the Warrens, which can be a PITA, not to mention (IIRC) 
out of your league -- you can get decent XP there while looking for 
the entrance to Broken Skull rock.
