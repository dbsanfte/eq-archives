First of all let me say this up front... I am not an ebay'er... That being
said, here's my problem.  My son and I shared an account. He started a Necro
and I started a Wizzy. I played my toon up to level 40 or so and then due to
work and other life issues I had to stop playing for about a year. My son
continued to play his toon and muct to my surprise he played mine too... he
leveled me all the way to 60, and got me some VERY nice gear. That's the
good part... now for the bad part... as you all know the game REALLY changes
after the mid 40's.  I want to get back in to the game but I'm in way over
my head and I don't want to cause a wipeout because I do something stupid.

So, what I'm looking for is a good Guild with members around my level that
is willing to help me scrape off the rust and show me the ropes. I play
regularly, and am in the Pacific timezone. I am looking to level, raid,
whatever, not in it for the loot, am willing take direction and play my role
until I can truely contibute.

I'm on the Rodcet Nife server.  Let me know by posting here, or send a tell
to Eros in game...
