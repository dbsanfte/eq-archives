When you guys cry about Verant not adding new zones, you can only
point the finger at yourselves. Its YOUR fault. When they do add new
zones, noone goes to them. And its not because they suck, I think its
because most folks like the no risk, easy xp of Ill Omen, and the
convience of Commons, oasis and all that.

Paineel- Place is a ghost town, lot of confusion on faction here too.
Folks don't realize that unlike other cities there is only ONE faction
in Paineel. They are ALL Heretics. No need worry about running into
some SK guild member and getting axed.

Warrens- Hardly ever see anyone in here, and I pass thru a lot. Maybe
a necro dying at zone and a lost druid on way to Stonebrunt. Perhaps a
monk attempting to solo the cave bat lord for whatever reason, but
empty otherwise.

Stonebrunt-  very very rarely is there more than 2 groups going at
once, and this zone is HUGE. All major camps empty (except for me
soloing one). Sure its pretty scarce, and there are some mid 30's
stuff roaming thru the 20ish section.  I took a mage from 22 to 29
here in a week just playing a few hours at a pop, but still uber
dangerous and by no means risk free.   Only reason I left was to buy
compenents for new mage pets.  But I can freely walk around Paineel
which makes Stonebrunt that much better.

Bottom line is, you can bet your ass that Verant is paying attention
to what the activity is in the new free zones they put out. So next
time you make that twink, don't hunt in Oasis in the teens, you've
done that already, goto Warrens. You've gone thru 20's in south
karana, how much more can you stand?  How many characters have to kill
sarnaks in Ill Omen before you teach them a lesson? Go some place new
for Brell's sake. sheesh.  Who knows, might even have an adventure.

Of course the main advantage of Stonebrunt will eventually be
compromised, as is now only experienced players are there, hardly ever
get a non-twink first timer up there, and that is good because its not
your ordinary old world zone, you actually have to think. And need to
know your class.
