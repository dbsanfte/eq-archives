Wizards, DT, Wizards.

The lad did commit the unforgiveable sin of top posting, but if you'd
scrolled down a bit you'd have seen that he did at least snip out
all but the MB nerf portion.

Do wizards have the lowest DPS of the game?  I don't think they
do, I think they may have the lowest sustained DPS, but taking out
manaburn doesn't hurt that at all, in fact MB was the worst
sustained DPS ability in the game.  Wizards have a high Burst
DPS, I suspect even without MB they have the highest Burst
in the game.

I know that it takes me quite a while to cycle thru all my mana
throwing out 925 point Judgements, for example, how long
does it take a wizard using regular spells to empty his  mana
bar, and how much more damage for the same mana total
has he layed out in that time?

Too, wizards have a lot of options as to the flavor of nuke
to use, which should mean if they have accurate information,
they get a lot less resists on average.  Of course on low MR
mobs I don't get many resists, on low FR or CR mobs
a druid gets few resists... but wizards should be more
flexible.
