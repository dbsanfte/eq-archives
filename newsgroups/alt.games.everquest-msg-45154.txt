Uh, that would suck. Who would decide what zones are appropriate and which
aren't for what level? Droga is not a high level zones, but the earring of
essence is one of the best earrings in the game, and so you find high
levels camping there. Should they be excluded from top-end equipment just
because they leveled too high? How about runneye? A common transit
zone...should people be thrown out of there when they zone in?
