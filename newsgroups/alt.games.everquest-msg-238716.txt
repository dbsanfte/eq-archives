First - 65/Normal mobs are easily tanked by a ranger.  My BL, with 
1170AC/6200+ HP group buffed tanks them just fine.  

Second - You're actually *complaining* that they grabbed a mission the
moment the group was full?  *boggle*  I get pissed when a group sits on
it's ass for too long, I'd relish a group that intends to PLAY, not
sit.  If someone insisted on wasting 30minutes of my time by waiting
for someone to come back, I'd leave and put *him* on my never group
again list.

Hell, most of my most recent LDoN's have been over in just over 30 minutes,
you could have gotten a win and just put the 'chanter on your "never group
again list" pretty easily in the same amount of time.

Third - WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT STANDINGS?  The only thing I worry about
in terms of win/loss is whether I'm going to waste 90minutes getting
lackluster XP and not get my points out of it.

BTW - I've played for hours through storms - the chances of a power/phone
out in one of our storms is pretty dang low.
