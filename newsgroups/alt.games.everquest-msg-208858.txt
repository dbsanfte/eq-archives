I don't know about perma-rooted mobs but no other summoning mob I've
run across works that way. It's especially noticeable while soloing.
Engage a summoning mob, activate Spirit Call when it gets to half,
root it, back out and heal/cannibalize/whatever while it beats on the
summoned doggies. I'll never get summoned unless root breaks and will
always get summoned immediately if root breaks. 

The same goes in a group if I root a mob and let my pet tank it. The
only time I'll ever get summoned is when root breaks. At least through
tier 3 in PoP I've never seen a summoning mob that reacts differently.
