I came up with this the other day while at work and thought you all
might enjoy.

To the tune of Imagine by John Lennon.

Imagine you're in SK,
It's easy if you try,
Splitpaw below us,
Above us moving sky,
Imagine all the people
grinding for xp...

You may say I'm a gamer,
but I'm not the only one,
I hope some day you'll join us,
And Norrath will live as one. 

Imagine there's no 'chanter,
It isn't hard to do,
No one to mez or clarity,
No cleric too,
Imagine all the people
medding OOM...

You may say I'm a gamer,
but I'm not the only one,
I hope some day you'll join us,
And Norrath will live as one. 

Imagine there's no phat lewt,
I wonder if you can,
No need for greed or killsteals,
A brotherhood of man,
Imagine all the people
Zerging all the world...

You may say I'm a gamer,
but I'm not the only one,
I hope some day you'll join us,
And Norrath will live as one.


Wayland
