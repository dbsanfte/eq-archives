Class-specific?  I don't see anything terribly exciting for my enchanter.
The thing I would most like to see at level 60 is Gather Mana, which will
bring you from OOM to FM in a moment.  Trouble is, I heard the recast time
is about 2.5 hours.

Not that I have to worry about it...my enchanter has been level 55 for a
couple months now, and with 90% going to AA it's going to be a LONG time
before he reaches a point where he can get that option.

As for AA in general...not very exciting at all.  My next 3 points will go
into innate running speed, after that the others will go into INT.  Once I
get those 6 AA points needed to start sticking some in my level 55 skills
(Advanced) I suppose I'll stick 'em all in the prerequisite for Gather Mana.
