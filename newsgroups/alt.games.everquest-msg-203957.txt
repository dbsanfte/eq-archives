If you had started out with an evil race character, and were now trying,
say, a High Elf Paladin, you'd have the same problem: you'd not be welcome
in the places you normally frequent.

You don't.  You deal with bankers and merchants where you aren't KOS...just
like the good races do.  You probably haven't seen many High Elves banking
in Neriak, right?

There are generally four kinds of places in Norrath, as far as banks and
merchants go:

    * Places the hate pretty much everyone except the locals.  Cabilis is
    like this.  With a lot of annoying faction work, non-Iksar can get in.

    * Places that like pretty much everyone.  The Bazaar is like this.
    Shadowhaven, too, although individual merchants might dislike you.

    * Places that like good, and dislike evil.  Kelethin, for example.

    * Places that like evil, and dislike good.  Neriak, for example.

You also have to consider more than just race.  There are places that have
no problem in general with Dark Elves, but that might take objection to you
because of your class, or what god you follow.

Bottom line: Norrath is big...there are plenty of places for any
race/class/diety combination.  You only have a problem if you want to stick
to the same places your other characters have been.
