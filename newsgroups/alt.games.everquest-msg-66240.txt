    When I first ran things last night, I was horrified to see that SoL had
given Delores and Rosy a shave. I've since restored them to bearded status,
but right now the only option is a grey, short beard. That works with
Delores, but Rosy looks like a grumpy old man. At least my gnome mage's new
flaming red hair and green eyes look awesome.
