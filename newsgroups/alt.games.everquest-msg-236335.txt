Upgrade with Evolution. It has all the expansions other than Lost
Dungons of Everquest and the latest one called Gates of Doom. It's
still the cheapest way to go to get most of the expansions. When you
input the CD key it will open up all but the last two expansions for
your use. No need to load the CDs.
