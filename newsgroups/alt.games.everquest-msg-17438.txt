I have been having the same problems.  It was easy to install and 
configure, but I am constantly getting timeouts.  The timeouts magically 
disappear when i connect my PC directly to the cable modem, so I know its 
not my ISP.

I am going to call support but looks like I will be returning it and going 
with a Linksys.
