Druid + Necro = Insane ability to kill shit.

Once you get Lich and you're druid buddy gets Cholorplast the Necro
will never, ever run out of mana.

Druids 10 minute snare makes fear kiting with your pet fantastically
simple.  SoW for pulling.  Ports for finding someplace to kill
quickly.

Both contribute a metric assload of DoT's with which to torment your
targets.

The druid/nerco combo is simply the most powerful duo in the game,
IMHO.
