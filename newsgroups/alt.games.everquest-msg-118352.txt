Apparently the code that controls vendors prohibits them
buying any No Drop item.  They would have had to have made a
special exception to allow bridles to be sold.

Instead, they just used existing "quest NPC" code to get
the job done instead.  That way it only needed a database
change (defining new NPCs, and what they'll give in
return for receiving item X) and no code changes at all.

The new quest NPCs will accept a bridle, and as a
"quest completion reward" give you a "big honkin' bag of
platinum", a droppable item that any vendor will give you
a wad of cash for (roughly 60% of the bridle's original
purchase price).

What I don't understand is why they had to add *four*
new NPCs, and make players figure out the appropriate
NPC for the particular bridle they want to turn in.
Maybe the quest database can only handle so many
"different" quests per NPC, thus no one NPC could
handle all 16 bridle types.

What I really wish they'd do, however, is make the
"turn in your horse" quest NPCs give you *some* hint
as to how much they'll give you for each grade of horse.
Right now, it's like a used car dealer saying, "sign
your used car title over to me, and *then* I'll hand
you an unspecified amount of cash for it..."  Yeah, right.
