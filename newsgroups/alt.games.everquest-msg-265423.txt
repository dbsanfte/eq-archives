How do you figure? It's there to *separate* the two. Separation is not
a one-way street. You betcha I'd be majorly upset (and am, because it
is happening) if a church supports a particular government function.

Why? Say the government saves $100k by having a church provide for the
polling. Now imagine this happens at 100 places. so we're talking $10M
by now. Now assume that church gets into a minor feud with the local
government over assigned parking in front of the church for example.
The church makes it known that if it looses the parking space in
question it will no longer provide polling places. The local
government now has to decide on spending $10M or making a minor
concession to the church.

This is just a random example (the scale is probably way off), but the
point is, you don't want this situation to even have the possiblity of
being created. Sure when it's parking spots it may be trivial, but
what if it's say about the church being unhappy about a government
endorsement of a Judge? I can think of a hundred conflicts of interest
arising. Once any amount of money or support enters the equation,
objectiveness goes out the window for a lot of people.

Secondly, I am not christian, nor a member of any religion for that
matter (not sure why not believing in anything isn't considered a
religion). I have a serious dislike for many religions, and want to
stay away from them.

Thirdly, do you feel some people will be influenced by say, having to
vote on an abortion issue if they have to cast that vote in a church
building? You can't think of some people who would be influenced by
that?

The separation of church and state is there for a very good reason.
And currently no one cares anymore.
- Presidents openly get involved in religious institutions such as
marriage, voicing opinion and using white house staff/lawyers to try
and affect the related laws and public opinion
- The federal government sponsors Faith Based Help/Assistance programs
- The words "under god" get inserted into the Pledge of Allegiance by
congress
- ... just read the news.

If you're an immigrated hardcore Jew from Israel, having to go to a
Christian Church to cast your vote is bordering an insult that the
government could probably be sued over. I'm sure there are many more
combinations of religions that this setup doesn't work well for. But
even if not, I am annoyed and angry and upset about it. I object. The
constitution clearly prohibits this mingling. There isn't really any
room for interpretation.

I'm not so sure what costs the church is taking on aside from
electricity for lighting (negligible). The people organizing and
overseeing the voting better not be church related people (i don't
think they are), many of whom are volunteers, others who are on a
government payroll anyway.  And even then I'm not so sure they're not
getting reimbursed for whatever costs they do incurr. Without some
research I wouldn't just assume that. It is however free advertising
for the church. People walk through halls of pictures and filled show
cases and schedules of the church. THIS is my main objection.

Scientology churches are readily found all over the US. I'm not sure
the fact that they are there alone should make them eligible voting
places.

A lot of really smart people have spent a long time thinking about
this, and at least I'm not familiar with any convincing arguments in
favor or decreasing the separation of church and state. If you can
make one, let's hear it.

Don't forget it's one of the founding principles of this nation.
