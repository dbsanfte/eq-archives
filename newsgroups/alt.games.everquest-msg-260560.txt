So you can learn the cutting edge tricks and tips from 2000?  I look
at the welcome page for these sites from time to time.  One thing I
always notice is that they have not been updated for 4 years or so. 
Mentioning the "uber" mobs such as Lord Negafen, bragging about
"exploits" that were fixed long ago, bragging about how you can level
to 50 (wow!) in a short amount of time, (not even discussing higher
levels than that), etc...

If these morons weren't complete lazy bastards, they would at least
update the list of exploits they supposedly know about to something
post-PoP.
