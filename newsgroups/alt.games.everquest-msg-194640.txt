First,

I got some Lizardman scales off of the Tae Ew lizards in Feerrott.
I can't find any use for them anywhere.
Anyone have an idea ?
I'm not sure if they are no drop as I'm on FV, but they Identify as :
Trophies used by Guja Commandos

So I was thinking that they could be something to do with a later Guja 
Token quest (Only number 1 and 2 on Alzakaz)


Secondly While poiking around at magelo I found a series of ear items 
called xxx Adventurer's loop (Grand, Mighty, Supreme) They are +INT +WIS 
+MANA ears With everlasting breath (either cast or worn). Any one know 
where they come from ?

Cheers,

Jim Monk
