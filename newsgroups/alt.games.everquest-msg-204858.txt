    The mobs at the very front of the zone are 45+. These items drop further
in, where the mobs are blue under the old /con system (so 55+). The walls
don't shield from aggro, so everything can social off a low-level puller.
And since the place is built like a maze, the mobs will take a long time to
arrive. Considering level 60+ players have caused huge trains just by
standing against a wall, I can't imagine a low-level raid having any success
here.
