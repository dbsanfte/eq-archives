That would not work because there are items in game that never reach the 
optimum buy and sell prices like gems do.  The example give was FS 
weapons, they sell to merchants for a maximum of 10ish pp, or is it 
around 5?  They are sold by merchants for quite a bit more than that.  
Gems on the other hand seem to have a best buy/sell price difference of 
around 10%.  Peridots for example are 9.5 to sell to a vendor, 10.5 to 
buy from a vendor at their best prices.  In order for the current system 
to work, FS weapons must have a different best buy/sell pricing 
mechanism.

Again, looking at Peridots.  They probably have an ideal price of 10pp, 
and a difference of 5% from that ideal price is the best buy/sell price.  
For FS weapons, it's more like 25pp is the ideal, and 60% to 80% is the 
difference from that ideal to the best buy/sell price.  Alternatively, 
they have two number stored, one for sell price, one for buy price.  It 
doesn't really matter which is the way it is actually done, both of them 
could be set such that the buy and sell are the same.  In addition to all 
of that, there are the faction and charisma modifiers.
