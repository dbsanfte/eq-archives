I use my melees for wolf and bear pharming; they don't have issues :)
I did kill a few with my druid when they gave exp, but the majority of
my pelts come from cats.
Heck, on the matter of roleplaying, my shadow knight is growing out of
her 'raw flesh is good eatin' stage and selling stacks of chunks of
meat to vendors instead of eating them. She's learning to make steaks
instead. No character of mine is ever going to have to resort to
_rations_...
