I play a druid and a monk, and I've noticed that, since the resistance rules
patch, I've been struggling whenever dealing with any form of caster; I had
one blue guy take me from full health to 20% with 1 spell (cold based and my
druid's resistance was 54) and so I've been happilly levelling by hitting
dire wolves and craig li.

Anyway, I've been thinking about going on a vox or nagafen raid while i
still can, but again and again i hear that your resists having to be over a
hundred unbuffed to be able to go on such a raid. I could toss away all my
wisdom gear and get that if i spend the next few months saving for it, or i
can forget all about it and go straight to level 60. Is that what everyone
else does? is that 100+ unbuffed a myth?

I noticed that high resists are easy for warrior types but seem impossible
to a monk without having gone raiding already; to raid you must have already
raided before the patch? And do i really have to lose 100 wisdom to wear the
resist gear verant seems to believe everyone should have? Or was that the
idea? By nerfing resistances, it's harder to level, and only uber looters in
uberguilds can have the resists and the wisdom/int/ac to go on raids?
