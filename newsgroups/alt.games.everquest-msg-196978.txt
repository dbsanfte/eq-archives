Why should they be expected to do so? The game changed. You don't deserve 
anything special because of it. How about this. I want the opportunity 
for the same reward you get even though the requirement was removed. Why 
should you have had the chance at the item(s) and not me? Maybe *I* 
thought the trials were worth that kind of reward after the fact. I can't 
believe the level of pettiness expressed by your whining on this.

So you want it both ways? Reward you for going through the trials, but 
keep limitations in place for others? I take it they would *not* receive 
any such reward? That's elitist bs.

It was definitely that.

This whole entitlement movement in this day and age just disgusts me.
