Yes, but now unfortunately, people such as myself won't be creating twinks
(granted, others will I know, though a good majority won't) as I simply
refuse to go through the LEARNING levels (1-40 imo) the "old school way."
Amazing they can literally change ones game play so dramatically by changing
something that has been available to us since I've started playing.

Was KEI too powerful?  Yes.  Though, its ashame that all the crying made
every other buff un-castable on low level twinks.
