I'll check into it, but last I heard those winkey killers don't work in
Win2000.  I removed my windows keys from my keyboard, works great, works in
all OSes.  Unfortunately, my cat decided one of the keys was a toy, and
knocked it on the floor, then one of my Golden Retrievers decided that it
looked tasty, now it's just a flat chewed up piece of useless plastic.
