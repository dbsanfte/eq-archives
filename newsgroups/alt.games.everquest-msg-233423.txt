You might have more fun in a smaller, more active group instead of a full
group.  For example, I really enjoy playing my enchanter in a duo with a
druid.  Tash, ensnare, charm.  Buff and/or haste the pet if you plan on
keeping the same one for a while.  Druid then plays damage dealer / puller /
healer (but you won't have to heal much since your targets will be slowed).

Of course, in the right places a druid can do almost all of this without the
enchanter, but enchanters get a more powerful charm line and can slow.  Exp
gained while using charmed pets was nerfed a while back, but in my
experience it is still quite good and with a druid to "keep a leash" on my
pets, it's also quite safe.  You'll certainly be more active in this kind of
situation than in a full group, and that's what it seems like you're looking
for.
