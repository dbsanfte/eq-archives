While the former might beleive anything at all. If I happen to beleive 
that the rest of the world is just a figment of my imagination, existing 
entirely for my amusement ... well ... I wouldn't be someone I would 
trust :)

So you beleive doing the 'right thing' for the wrong reasons is an 
immoral act?

The premise here is that God had a reason, and that God's reasons though 
they be unbeknownst to us, will be "VERY GOOD". Another example, the 
Jesus incident...where the premise is that he sets up his own son to be 
executed is similiar, he's deliberately gone out his way to have his own 
kid executed this time. However, in this case the motivation was to 
bring salvation to mankind... and spare us, each one, from eternal 
damnation.

In my example he actually went through with it, in yours he apparently 
had no intention of having the boy killed. But Abraham was operating 
under the beleif that his God had a very good reason for it...
