I've been playing on Morden Rasp recently because on my main server 
all my slots are filled and I wanted to make a berzerker. My take on 
it is there are lots and lots of lowbies in the newbie gardens. This 
will make it so much easier on people brand new to the game to find 
people to help them out.  For example: I was sitting in Shar Vahl 
waiting on Chialle so I could do the turn-in for the 'uber' +5 HP 
ring and someone came up to me and hailed me and told me they were 
new.  I was like wow, a real newbie.  I ended up spending the next 2 
hours with him. I took him around and showed him how to do the 
citizen quest, told him some of the major websites we use.  I had to 
tell him how to do many things I don't even think about how to do any 
more.  He didn't know how to shout, he didn't know how to give items 
to NPCs, he had trouble with figuring out how to get a bag off his 
cursor when his slots were full.  With my help, he learned a few 
things and he killed a few beasts.  He even had his first death, I 
told him, death happens alot, get used to it.  He ended up telling me 
that he had been frustrated because EQ is way more complicated than 
Diablo and if it wasn't for me he would have quit.  The best 
compliment I've ever gotten ingame.  What have you done for newbies 
lately?
