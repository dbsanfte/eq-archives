As i remember its more of a prequel style book, focus is mainly on the very
beginnings and the mythology of middle earth, read it ages ago and to be
honest dont recommend it for any but the keenest fans.

Yep :)...and imho Faramir is a seriously cool fella

Now, I am struggling with my memory too, I think I will have to dig out a
copy and have another read through, I think as someone else has mentioned,
you will find out more about Arwen and Aragorn later, the more detailed
information is actually not in the main story but is given at the end on the
form of appendices. If i remember correctly, the scene does exist, but not
mentioned in the main book.

Pity about your map, it is a bit large to be squeezed down onto a single
page :)...ooh which was a nice touch in the film, i noticed they used the
original syle map in the beginning scenes. - the book I have has a big fold
out one - which to my shame also reminds me that i pinched it from the scool
library when i was a kid :o ...ahh!  generations of kids denied because of
my greed :)


Nee....greedy little hafling hands even at a young age
