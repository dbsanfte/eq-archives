Being a shaman, I am not plagued by this as much as some other classes, but
I do get tired of people sending me tells telling they need some buffs.  I
generally just ignore direct tells, unless I am not busy.  If someone says
it in ooc and I am nearby, I will generally sow them.  I hate it when I just
get a tell out of the blue from someone who does a /who shaman.  I never ask
someone for something in a tell unless they are someone I know already.  I
find it just as rude as some hustler on the street coming up to me and
asking for money.
