Just a heads up to those that are playing Iksar Beastlords. I was
wondering around East Cabilis and saw Prime Hierophant Vuzx in the
Warrior guild area and not where he should be on the second floor
above the shaman guild area. I have sent a few feedbacks, and bug
reports over the last few days, but nothing has changed as of this
posting. I have helped a few people find him that were not aware of
this.
