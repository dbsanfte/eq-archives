What about the prospect of six Shamans? Not only can they "tank" the best
out of every caster (except BL maybe?), but they can heal, debuff, root,
DoT, DD, buff, send in six different pets with decent haste, and still most
of the group could keep Cannibalizing to full mana. Now this, this could be
a blast...
