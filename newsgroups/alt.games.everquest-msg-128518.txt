pretty straightforward question with two parts:

1) what's a good place for a lvl 34 ranger and lvl 34 druid to duo for
exp?
2) what's a good place for a lvl 34 ranger and lvl 34 druid to duo for
plat/loot?  (the druid pitties the poor ranger who cannot do ports for
plat.)

keep in mind the druid really doesn't like dying, while the ranger has
been on enough corpse runs they're really not that upset about it
(hooray for being bound in iceclad while the corpse is in runnyeye!
then later the same night, being bound in rivervale while the corpse was
in iceclad!).

thanks in advance,

devon
