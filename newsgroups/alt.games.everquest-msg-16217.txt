This is why I say 5 necros maybe sub the with a mage pet that will
stun.  Plus a tracker Bard or Druid.  

The pets never miss a target due to stuns, pattern changes mobs going
over obstacles.  Plus a stunned mob does not go to far out of range. 

There is no need for any other character the necro is a machine that
can fight all day, never needs clarity and SOW is a big luxary.

The biggest problem with necros is that most of them have no concept
of what most of there spells do.
