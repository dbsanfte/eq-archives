Haven't seen any problems with the first two.  The last one is just a bit
over-eager.  Still, I think it's a good class-race combo.  Only the three
large races (which oddly doesn't inclued those huge frikken Vah Shir) can
bash.  Of those three, two are "butt scratchers" (or used to be).  In other
words, many people probably don't like playing Trolls and Ogres.  That
leaves me with one large race class, Barbarians.  Haven't actually played a
warrior yet, though.  Too many other alts.

Many of my fellow paladins should be playing shadow knights, I suspect.
It's not a difficult class to roleplay right, unless you're looking for max
efficiency, or to get things you have no right to (ie, KSing).  I sometimes
wish there was a non-role playing penalty on this class.

I think it's more the fact that a bad Bard can be ten times more destructive
than another class.

Still not too fond of halfling druids... or Dwarven Paladins (only known
two, one was a complete arse, and the other one kept trying to get inside my
greaves).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
