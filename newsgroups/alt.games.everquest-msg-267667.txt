Its amazing how much main memory can speed things up.  (Not graphics
card memory)

I have a P4 1.6GHz with 512Mb of RAM and an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro with
128Mb.  EQ2 was very close to unplayable with this system.  I had to
change to extreme performance on the lowest resolution just to get it
anywhere near close to playable.

Last night I put extra memory in to make it 1Gb and the change is
amazing.  I put the setting up to balanced, turned down a few options
that I consider aren't worth the extra CPU power and changed the screen
res to be 1280x1024.  The game has been transformed!

I was very worried that I would have to upgrade my whole system at an
extra cost of =A3300 but that won't be needed now.  :-)
