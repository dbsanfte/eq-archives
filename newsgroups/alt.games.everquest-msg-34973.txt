Normal ranged AE spells can hit a maximum of 4 targets. Al'Kabor spells
(wizard ranged AEs with a terrible mana/damage ratio) can hit 5 I believe.

Point-blank AEs can hit any number of targets. My personal best is 11 orcs
at once in CB (while I was paying DVinn a visit for old times sake) but I'm
sure other people have done many more.
