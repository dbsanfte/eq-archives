In my opinion I think twinking or being twinked is getting items or
equipment that you would never have a shot at earning if you were
soloing or grouping (within experience level range) for it.  This is
how I personally define twinking.  I'm not saying I'm right or wrong. 
I've done it, and most people that play have either been twinked or
twinked other people.
