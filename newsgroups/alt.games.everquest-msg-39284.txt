I admit, I have used a Cracked darkwood shield on my SK from level 6 to
level 40. I just never got around to replacing it with anything. It's
decent for low to mid levels at 12 ac, +9 str; goes for about 150-250pp
on my server, or you can get it yourself in HighHold at late teens/
early 20's.

Other good ones, from low to high:
low: shiny brass shield - ac 10, +10 MR, cheap, maybe 20-40 pp
mid: cracked darkwood, that chitin one from UGuk off the heart spider,
Mistmoore battle shield, maybe crustacean shield?

35+: shield of shadows in Tower of Frozen Shadow, Atremonious Shield in
City of Mist

higher: Clay guardian shield, sarnak battle shield, whatever (not at
this level myself so don't really know).
