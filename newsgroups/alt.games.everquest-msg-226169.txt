That "fact" remains?  Please, use direct quotes and try to piece together my
words to make them say that.  Please.  You don't even have to keep them in
the sentences they are in, feel free to mix and match.  You're missing some
pretty important words in my quote to ever be able to convey that "fact",
but I'm giving you free reign to twist them around however you can to try
and make them say what you want.

So disorganized that they don't have someone assigned specifically to
such important things as malo and slow?

Do you just charge at mobs and wait for a tank to say he's getting hit to
start healing him too?

You'll notice, I mentioned the raid channel.  :P

So, are all your wizards in the debuff channel?  They might want to know
when malo lands.  Druids?  Rangers?  Snare and other debuffs often depend on
malo being in.  Bards in the debuff channel too, I guess, for occ.  Add
magicians to the debuff channel, they'll be wanting to nuke right after the
wizards.  Of course the tanks will want to know when the mob is slowed.  And
the clerics, so they can adjust accordingly...  why, looks like you've got
90% of your raid in the debuff channel.  So much simpler to have the less
important debuffs in a separate channel, but the ones the full raid needs to
know about called in...  wait for it...   the channel everybody in the raid
is in (that's raid chat for most people, i.e., debuff channel for you).  :P

But then I suspect a quick look at the website for your guild would probably
show that you're just talking out of your ass.
