Halflings can make a similar bag by tailoring, not sure what they go for
though.  Also think a GM Trophy might be a way to go for a monk, you get
1 regular 10 slot giant size bag with 100% weight reduction, IIRC no
weight, and you can summon as many no rent versions of this bag as you
want as well.  Cost you around 1-5k to master one of the easier
tradeskills like jewelcraft or possibly pottery if you use a geerlok, &
kei's depending upon luck, int or wiz, gear, if you have an enchanter
slave to enchant bars or clay etc. The trophy itself costs about 4k in
components, but it has about a 40% (SWAG) failure rate at capped skill
levels.
