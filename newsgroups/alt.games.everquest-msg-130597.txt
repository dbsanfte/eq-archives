Do not press character delete.

What you want to do, is post to your guild board: Here's the cut off. After
the raid starts, I ain't yer port-bitch. And I ain't leaving until I'm good
and ready to. This guild either needs to recruit a wizard to TL folks out,
or everyone is staying for the duration of the raid from here on in. Period.
I don't care if you're the guildleader, or offering me better than my Jade
Reaver. And if it doesn't work like that, I'm finding a new guild that
doesn't treat me like a port-bitch.

Of course, feel free to alter the language to suit yourself. But you want to
be that firm and straightforward. Treat me right, or I'm out of here. And
you ALWAYS have the right to say NO. No matter who it is. Even if it was me
for a nekkid CR and you really really liked me.

/guildremove is a MUCH better option.
