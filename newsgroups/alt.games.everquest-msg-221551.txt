Hmm, well no, I too touch type, but I don't have any trouble
moving to my arrow keys, which are right to the right of the
typewriter section of my keyboard.  Of course I've been doing it
forever this way, so turning out the lights wouldn't slow me down
at all, I know perfectly well where those keys are, and they have
a very distinctive feel anyway, sitting overthere isolated in
their diamond shape.  I -do- have to move off the keyboard to use
the mouse, which I also use a lot, for selecting targets and
clicking on spell icons and so forth.  But I don't "talk" (type
communications) while I'm doing that, so its not too disruptive
for me.

I'm sure there's an advantage to the asdf plan or the awdx
plan... I just never was comfortable with letters as function
keys, I like things nice and simple, left arrow for turn left, up
arrow to move forward, like that.

Everyone has their own preferences, though, which is why being
able to assign keys is such a great function.
