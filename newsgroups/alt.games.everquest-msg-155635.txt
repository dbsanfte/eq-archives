I do a lot of RP in-game, in a guild that does a lot of RP. I have
about 4 female characters (Where the hell did the term "shim" come
from, anyway?). I've never actually been "hassled" about it, though. I
roleplay. If someone's roleplaying with me and can't grasp the concept
that IC and OOC are completely seperate things, that's their problem,
not mine.

I've seen some pretty thick-headed BS being said about guys who play
female characters, though. We're all faggots, we're intentionally
trying to deceive them, it's a horrible thing to do, we're lying
scumbags.... Really, geez. I'm playing a game. I never say anything to
imply that I, the player, am female. If asked, I will say straight out
that I am a guy. If there's even a hint of "affection" being shown
toward me, the player, I will stop things and inform them that I am a
guy. I don't lead anyone on. Even if IC things get to where the
"characters" might get close, I will inform the player that I am a
guy. (My druidess was married IC for a while. I made sure that the
other player knew I was a guy, that IC is IC and has no bearing on
OOC, and that I would not cyber with the character specificly because
she was a she and I was a he. >< (and he was a he) Things were cool,
it was a fun storyline to roleplay while it lasted)
