And they ARE addressing the issue, as Sui mentioned - 
and she also mentioned what happened when they addressed 
it hastily, and the consequences of doing that.  You 
think you might want to pay attention to history?

Remember what the Germans said about Jews?  What are you 
guys saying about Afghanistanis (or whoever certain 
ranting people tend to suspect, there seem to be several 
groups) right now?  "Eradicate em all to get the bad 
ones".  I've seen propaganda tapes from after the war 
with Germany and they were NOT pretty.  They told 
soldiers that Germans were not to be talked with, not to 
be associated with, basically, not to be treated as 
human beings.  WHY is it alright from your side, but not 
from the enemy's side?  Why is it that it's NEVER 
alright to have such an idea?

Who waited until after THEY were attacked to get 
involved in a world war?  Who waited until after THEY 
were attacked to get involved in the war against 
terrorism?  My whole problem was that certain statements 
made on the radio are trying to make the US sound like 
they're doing this for the glory of the world.  You guys 
have a tendency to come off sounding like the reborn 
saviour when all you're doing is defending your own.  
Which I don't have a problem with.

This IS a tragedy.  However, do you think that the one 
hundred people who lost someone in a car bombing feel 
any less worse than the people who lost someone in this?  
It's rather unfair to claim a right to all the pain in 
the world - you have your share, trust me - we are all 
upset, all scared, all hurt that anybody could do such a 
horrible thing.  My mom had nightmares most of the night 
last night - I couldn't sleep and wandered back and 
forth imagining what it must have been like to be on one 
of those planes, or to be in the building when it 
started coming down, or to be looking out the window 
when the plane came at you... trust me, I won't be 
sleeping well for a long, long time.
