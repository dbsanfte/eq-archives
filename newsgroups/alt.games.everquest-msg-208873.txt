Is it just me, or have the guilds that are now in the elemental planes been
plundering mid-level guilds for members so they can get the numbers they
need to get into Time?

In the past few weeks, about nine level 65's in my guild have 'felt the need
to move on' and a day or so later, I see them in one of the elemental planes
tagged for whatever guild is working to get into Time, skipping a lot of
content and just jumping to the current 'high end game'.

I don't know, but I prefer the journey to the destination.
