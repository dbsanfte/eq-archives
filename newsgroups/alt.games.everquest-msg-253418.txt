You really ought to read the *whole thing* before you post.

If the child is using the account the parent may not use it. Thus 
'sharing your account with your child' (Remington's exact words) is in 
violation of the EULA. A parent must assume billinging and legal 
responsibility for their minors accounts, but they can't share them with 
those children. See the last bit in parenthesis.
