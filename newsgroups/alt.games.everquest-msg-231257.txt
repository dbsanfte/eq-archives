The only time I give anything away is when I choose to give something away,
and then I will hit a newbie zone and watch awhile before I ask a particular
character if they need equipment.  I never OOC.  When a beggar hits me up, I
graciously decline to give them any plat or equip, but offer to buff.  Most
of the time the beggar is happy with my offer, but a few times I've gotten
"Bah" or some other comment and then I know what kind of player they are.
