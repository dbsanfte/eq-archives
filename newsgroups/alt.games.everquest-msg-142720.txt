Which was not your stated point.

Which is capitalism, which works with both perfect, and imperfect people.

I doubt that.  The U.S. has always been a place where a bit of ingenuity and
effort would pay off.  Modern times are even more that way.

How about "economic classes"?  The poor were hardly pariah.

That large middle class was built out of the upward mobility from the
industrial revolution (minus the upheval of the thirties).

Sorry, alarms go off in my head whenever someone uses fiction as evidence.

My intend was to get rid of the silly notiong that socialism would be ideal
with a perfect people.  Capitalism is the best system over the entire
spectrum of personalities.

I see little good that has come from the socialist aspects of government.
Remember that watchdogging isn't unique to socialism.

Keep raising taxes on the rich, and raising the threshold on taxation, and
you'll soon see large voter turnout... those voters who no longer pay taxes,
and want to ensure the rich continue to pay everyone else's way.
