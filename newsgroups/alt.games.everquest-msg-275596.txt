It is almost impossible in this period of the game to solo as far as you can 
go

the game is not cut out for it

also even when you do level, the odds of having enough people to help you 
get the keys and flags you need are slim to none since the majority of the 
player base has already passed that stage and are raiding

your best bet would be to move straight into EQ2
