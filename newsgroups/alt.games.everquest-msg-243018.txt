There's a lot more server-side code, and they also don't have the
financial resources of, say, an ISP's servers dedicated to the server.
Of the $13 per month you pay, most of that goes to the salaries of
GMs, live dev teams, and so forth. They also have much more
complicated code to maintain and even heavier traffic than a web
server.

You started playing at a bad time. A problem like this, especially
running this long, is highly unusual.

Actually, by making the statement, you were doing just that. Sorry,
too late for backtracking.
