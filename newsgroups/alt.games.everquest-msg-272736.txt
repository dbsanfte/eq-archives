You know... I find this conversation extremely amusing.

Two months ago, it was Sony, those bloodsucking bastards, they've stolen all
the development money from EQ1 and used it for EQ2.   They're going to let us
EQ1 players wither and die with no further expansions because the evil bean
counters say EQ2 is a better use of their time.

Now, it's instead Sony, those bloodsucking bastards.  How dare they release
another expansion for EQ1?  Look at them try to squeeze every last penny out
of us players. Etc, etc, etc.

I guess when people make up their minds that they are going to hate you, it
doesn't really matter what you do at that point.
