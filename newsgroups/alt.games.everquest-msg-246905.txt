The greater real issue is the 10% of the people who *had* security up 
but who *won't* for whatever reason or other remember to turn the 
security settings back on -- or who will do so improperly. These people 
will then have those holes open indefinately.

You must understand that if you've got IE properly locked down its more 
than just a single checkbox. If this were cars we're swapping the 
engine, not changing the oil. There's a lot of room to forget something, 
and its difficult to validate at the end, especially without established 
procedures... at least with a car you can turn it on and listen to it... 
with security you've got to run a battery of simulations against it, or 
follow an established process that's had a battery of simulations run 
against it. You don't just go willy-nilly flipping checkboxes in the 
advanced settings if you want real security. :)
