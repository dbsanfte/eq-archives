This is what the dev's have actually said,

"This appears to be a global problem, not just limited to these zones or 
items.

This is what I found out from code. We're looking into it but so far we 
have been unable to reproduce the issue on our test or bets servers. I 
changed the respawn on the wizard epic item you mentioned on beta to 
almost instant and it repopped over and over and over as I picked it up 
with no issues.

We are still trying really hard to reproduce the issue but it might be 
that the problem has already been resolved via other code changes on 
Test/Beta that aren't on Live yet. We'll be keeping a close eye on this 
after the patch on Wed. and if it's still happening after that we'll 
continue looking into the problem.
