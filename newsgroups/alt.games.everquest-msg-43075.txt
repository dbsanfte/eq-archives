ive seen a few iskars fighting in HHP and later on  inside the castle. kill
gnolls and orcs till your not kos to guards and merchants head inside go to
basement to Ear quest to get more faction with the good people. basement can
keep u busy till mid 30's. and its the best spot ive ever hunted for monks.
in the basement there are the mobs from 25-35 and there is a staircase going
right up to a bunch of guards 2 merchants and right around the corner is the
bank. all without zoning. warning guards are WEAK 2 or more goblins can kill
a guard. also if u are beating a goblin IT will run to guards they will KS
you and you lose out on exp.
