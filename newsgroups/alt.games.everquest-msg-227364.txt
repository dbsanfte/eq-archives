Sounds like there was a mutiny and your old officer was on the wrong end.


It appears that your old leader is fairly considerate, after all he did let
everyone know he wouldn't be able to log on for a while, arranged for
someone to take over the leadership and run things in his absence.  His
attitude towards not wanting to inflame the situation is also commendable,
and from what you have written l don't think he would have destroyed his own
website either.
I would always choose a guild which has good ethics/morals over anythign
else - at least you can be assured you'll be given a fair go and not screwed
over.
