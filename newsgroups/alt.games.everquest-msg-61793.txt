I just replaced my Voodoo3 with a GeForce2 MX400 64MB card. Paid more
than I should have, but where I am it's either Circuit City or mailorder,
and I wanted it *now*. After reading the message boards I had little 
hope of EQ working properly with the Voodoo3 from here on.

TestEverquest with DX8.1 looks great at first glance.
