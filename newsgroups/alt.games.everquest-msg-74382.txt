Oh, I hear the siren song that it's singin' to you, and I -know- the
feeling!

Ok, that gotten out of the way, I have a sister-in-law who is -really- dumb
(IQ 72, as I ranted about not too long ago), and she somehow ended up
getting disconnected in Nektulous last night, her body being in the water,
close to the bridge. She was nowhere -near- the bridge when she died, so I'm
gonna assume that she ran about (while she was disconnected) irrationally
until she actually fell into the water, or her unconscious self, while not
being connected, ran into the water of its own volition. It wasn't that big
a deal -- she lost all of about 1pp that I had given her (since her corpse
disappeared before she could get to it/not drown) I guess my reply might be
that -her- corpse was gone within about an hour or so (she was lvl 3) I know
that the decay time has changed, but not sure what it is at the moment...

Uhhh... what IS the coin quest? Never done that one!
thanks

Darklet, druid of *almost* 18 seasons




Thanks for playing.
