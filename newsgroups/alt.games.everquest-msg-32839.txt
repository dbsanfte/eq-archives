Well we had a good group going in OT the day before yesterday. The tank was
also the puller and for the rest we had a cleric, a shaman and me, a mage.
The tank/puller would pull 2 mobs at the same time and when both were down
he pulled another double. The point was that the tank/puller almost always
was down to 2 bubs of health when he pulled. As soon as the pull hit the
group the cleric would complete heal the tank.
For some reason (I think the damshields, but not sure) the cleric never got
aggroed and the 1 complete heal was usually enough for the rest of the
battle. With the occasional heal on my pet when it got aggro.

Now the timing should be way off here, as soon as the CHeal hit the cleric
should have been aggroed by the mob which wasn't beat on. But it didn't.
So an advice for every cleric out there: make sure you have a good
damshielder in the group and you're homefree :)
