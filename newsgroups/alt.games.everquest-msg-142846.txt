And, of course, I suspect a druid would be of LESS use in a group
using this to heal instead of cblast and NT. Instead of throwing out
fast, reasonable sized heals and keeping an eye on everyone including
robes, you get to sit like a CH cleric, staring at the tanks and
deciding when they're 10 seconds from 75 percent health being better
than a simple 1k-ish heal. At raids, it'd be used to make up for slips
in CH rotations and I suspect NT is adequate/better for it anyway.
Basically, this is just a toy for a druid/warrior duo or similar.

We need this like a fish needs a bicycle. (Tweak NT a little instead!)
