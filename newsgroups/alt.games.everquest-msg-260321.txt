You know, I've read your posts for a long time (DAoC at the
very least) and have respect for your opinions.  I was 
saddened to hear about the way things seemed to work in the
stress test.  However - I've also heard people just raving
about it, and it has a lot of things to like.  Will Blizzard
adequately stop hacking?  Will the community be worth being
a part of?  (go go RP server, PLEASE!)  Will a bit of time
elapsing ameliorate the crowding issues?  Those things are
yet to be determined.  Is everything I've heard (including
your posts) enough to decide to spend a measly $50 and 
a month of game time to find out?  Absolutely.  I'm buying
WoW at release.

As for EQ2 - The same company who shoved a non-game out
the door like SWG, the same company that has destroyed EQ
(IMO) and likes to shove imcomplete and buggy code out the
door is releasing it.  That one I won't be buying unless I
see a vast number of people who's opinions I respect absolutely
raving about it.
