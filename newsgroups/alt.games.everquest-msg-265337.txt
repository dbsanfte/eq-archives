What class do you play? On my first Mystic on Beta1 I had Skeleton Mastery 
and the Skeleton Mastery Smite that I got was very nice, did like twice the 
damage or my ordinary smite. But I haven't been back there since I started 
my current main on Beta2 and haven't yet attained any of the Masteries. 
However, in the spell revamp, Shamans lost Smite so I'm wondering if they 
took my Mastery spell away ...
