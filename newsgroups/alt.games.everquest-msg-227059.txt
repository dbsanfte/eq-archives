	True.  Getting everyone into groups is an ideal, and ideals are never
realized.

	No.  I'm a Ranger, I can solo if I want.  On the few occasions when I have
wanted to group (mostly to get into LDoN groups), if I don't get a group in 15
minutes or so, I write it off and do something else.

	Not so.  Grouping bonuses have always been there -- it's just that up
until fairly recently, they have been inadequate.
