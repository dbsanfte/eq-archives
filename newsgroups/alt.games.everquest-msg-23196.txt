I like this I am having problems logging on to Prexus err 1017 lost
connection with patch server. I tried 3 other servers Brell Brisbane and
Sullon Zek with no problem. I go into the Chat room and ask the GM if there
is a problem with Prexus explaining I am able to get onto these other
servers. GMs reply this is a connection problem check with your ISP. This
really makes sense being in their Chat Room able to log onto their other
servers and my ISP is having problems.
