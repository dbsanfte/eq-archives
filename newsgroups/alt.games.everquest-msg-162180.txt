Oh, ok now I get it.  Thanks for clearing this up for me:
I spend 50+ levels playing a class that, lets face it, is not exactly a
"necessity" to a group.   I can live with that, I like to solo.  But because at
level 60 + a ranger in a group can outdamage a warrior or caster they are
thinking of nerfing them. 
Of course we'll still be able to *melee*, so long as we aren't being beaten
senseless since we don't have the hitpoints or AC of a warrior, or the melee
damage output.
Oh YEAH, smacking forhead, that's because we are RANGERS.
