From the shadows, the mysterious Tracey <rbrancher2@aol.com> (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

One of the longest running myths. It takes one day to get even the two
handers maxed from nothing even at high levels, and mere hours to get
the 1h maxed. Also, only the melee classes need to worry about it at
all and the OP wanted a caster.

Definately keep casting maxed though (can let Div slide a bit).
