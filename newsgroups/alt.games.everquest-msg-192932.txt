Exactly. Im willing to help someone who isnt begging as opposed to
someone who begs. I couldnt belive that guy on the lizard. When he
realized that he got no sympathy mounted - he promptly dismounted, and
took off all of his armor and continued to beg. There are those that
want it all immediately. They miss out on how rewarding it is to earn
your own stuff. Heck, if that person went out and earned his stuff,
hed probably get rich faster than begging. With the bazaar these days
- its not hard at all to earn your way through. Dont these people have
any dignity????
