Execute them? :) Ok. I'm kidding

Seriously though,  The purpose of government isn't to keep idiots from
killing themselves.  Its to keep them from hurting others.  If you are a
bad parent, and refuse to work.  We shouldn't reward you for breeding. 
If you are a good parent having a bad year or 3  then a leg up is
appropriate.  But the Public teat must be closed eventually.  It must
not be a perpetual feed.  An occasional sip from the public teat is good
for society.  But a perpetual sucking sound causes harm to the drinker
and to the source.  IMHO it should be a psuedo-loan against future taxes
paid.  If I attend public school.  I accrue a psuedo-debt.  If I go on
to a public college my psuedo debt grows.  Once my obligation reaches a
certain point with no taxes(income)  Then I must work until it is paid
down.  As I pay taxes I accrue credit against future or past public aid.
I pay taxes of approx 3K a year for 5 years then my obligation/available
public credit is paid down/credited with 15K.  Perhaps a cap of +/- 100K
as a limit to total available credit/debt, to prevent abuse.
