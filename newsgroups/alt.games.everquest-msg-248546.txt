Well now, my theory got blown to hell last night in PoJ; I hadn't been on
the test server since early Sunday, and last night in PoJ, the rats were the
giant new model...for me. For my buddy, they were still the tiny ones. Which
I discovered caused a bit of a problem. I'm the cleric, he's the warrior, so
of course I depend upon him for keeping aggro, which normally he does very,
very well. However, at one point, we had 2 rats aggro on us. And he couldn't
keep them off me because, well, he had the old models, which are tiny...and
had other things goin' on at his home which were distracting him...and
because of the small size of the rodents, he couldn't see that one was
aggroing on me. I guess he didn't notice my life meter going down, down,
down. :) Anyway, if the models were consistently the larger ones, and he
could actually see the new models, this would make life a little easier in
many ways.

And of course, once I died, he died as well, although he did run...but shot
past the exit from PoJ, decided it would be suicide to turn around, tried
making the block, but didn't quite make it...
