I'm pretty sure everyone was indifferent/amiable to me, I have probably
lowered my C Q G faction a little, but not a huge amount....and no one
attacked me as I was walking around...but when I was 1 damn second from
camping (it was like 5....am so just gave me the hump :D, I dont mind dying
if its my fault...but that was just....pathetic).
