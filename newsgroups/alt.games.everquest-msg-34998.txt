I did level 26-31 (31 right now) in South Karana near the middle, and now i
started to go inside Splitpaw around level 28, if you get a group of 6, (2
tanks, one strong healer, and 3 others) u can get mad exp. I got through level
30 in about 2 days, and im almost past 31. would be out of it if i didnt get
killed but that wasnt my fault. Someone trained us with deeper gnolls

So Splitpaw is a good place
