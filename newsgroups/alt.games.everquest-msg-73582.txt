I finally got to see LotR last night too.   I enjoyed it a great deal.  Like
many others, I suffered many "Everquest flashbacks" during some of the
scenes.   When the leader orc was shooting arrows into the good guy (name
escapes me) I couldn't help thinking " Named ORC!, On him!".   When they
were in the mines running from the Balrog(sp),  "Boss mob is aggroed, EVAC!"
and "Train to ZONE!".


Since I play a dwarf, I am even more proud of my race now.  "No one tosses a
Dwarf!"

one question I have... What is the AC of a mithril chestguard?  That was
some pierce the thing deflected, hehe.

one real question.  Is there any reference to mithril before LotR?  I don't
see it in my old dictionary.
