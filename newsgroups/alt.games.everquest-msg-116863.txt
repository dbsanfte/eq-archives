Because it's in the manual.
My manual, which comes with Everquest special edition (EQ + Kunark +
Velious) bought in July 2001, contains a player field guide stating that
it's a tradition to shout "Ding xx" thru the zone, and another tradition to
answer "Congratulations", or even "Gratz" to show you're a seasoned player.
