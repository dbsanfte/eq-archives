The average cycle time between planned patches is seven days. In a
corporate environment, seven days isn't enough for the planning phase
of an upgrade to a complex system like EQ. Whatever change caused
people to crash on zoning clearly never made it to test or did not
cause problems on test because it is load-based. If it has to do with
the "no pause when new people enter zone" fix, it may well be that it
works fine with 500 people on a server, but doesn't scale well with
3,000 concurrent users.

If you'd like to be in an environment where these things never happen,
I suggest you find one that patches annually. And, when you do, CIHYS?
