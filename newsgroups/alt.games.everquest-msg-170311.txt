Duh?

Run is the "Duh" AA, the only real question is what to do with the
OTHER 3 points!

Of course you may be able to argue differently, but thus far I've yet
to see anyone not come around when you point out that Run means "faster
than mobs" and works indoors, outdoors, despite dispells... always
works.

Do you really ever sit around waiting for HP to come back up without
bandages or a healer casting on you?  I suppose a soloing wizard is
more likely than anyone else to actually do so, but its hard for me to
imagine.  Stop getting hit!  Perhaps Run 3 would help there.
