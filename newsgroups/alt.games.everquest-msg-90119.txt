For future reference...  The Nexus counts as Outdoor...  I get through
Paludal with no problems when going from Shadowhaven to elsewhere by casting
SoW and then Camo just before the zone in to Shadowhaven...

Then, I book it through Shadowhaven and into Paludal and I don't stop til
I've reached my destination...

Yes, sometimes the Camo wears off, but I'm well past the Pharty guys by then
and I don't have to deal with that stupid disease that lasts for an hour
crap...

Good luck and Happy Hunting!
