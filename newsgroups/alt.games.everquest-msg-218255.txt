If you find one, please tell me.

Best bet is try changing viewpoints, that's what I often do, and tilt the 
camera angle so I am looking from above.  Still, when 2 mobs are in the 
same spot, with the same name, if neither is below 100% health, it becomes 
nearly impossible to make sure you have hit both with slow.
