Then you didn't read it right before you got on your tired free speech high
horse.  Read it again.

Now, one of two things has motivated you to take offence here.

1)  You take offence at me personally because you think I'm advocating the
restriction and regulation of expression.  In this case, you're wrong.  I'm
doing precisely the opposite.

2)  You're simply taking offence at any use of the word 'enforcement', in
which case your beef is with the English language and not with me
personally.

And since you mention free speech, I'll say this:  I strongly believe in
free speech.  I also strongly believe in personal responsibility.  And I
believe it is an inexcusable abuse of the one to use it to avoid the other.
