Since no one has answered yet I will give what advice I can(all Ive done was
helped out on the war-havent done the quest myself).So sorry I dont really
know much-I hope something here helps.

1) The dwarven army is kept in place outside Thurg en masse by one player
spamming the Dwarf NPC with the trigger phrase that makes him call the
Dwarves to him.
2) I think there are 3 waves of giants to deal with-the encounters get
progressively worse with a pause of some minutes in between each.After the
three waves the named giant spawns-I went ld half way through this due to
the overload of spell spam and sprites on my screen:( -anti lag measures a
must!)
3)Each wave seems to be split into attacks from 2-3 diff giant spawn
locations-sorry dont know locs.
4) If any of the giants hit Thurg its over-there will be runners that must
be intercepted-The Dwarven army held outside Thurg can help with this but
runners need to be chased down-Just getting aggro on the runner is not
really enough as the aggro toward Thurg itself seemed to be very high on the
list-you have to really upset a runner to make him stop and fight you.
5) When I saw it done there were 20 or so dedicated people there for the
quest who were mid 50s-60. The entire thing seemed to take about an hour.

Things I saw that seemed to help- Everyone was sowed,there were lots of
Tanks available.Disease was liberally used to combat regens,heavy nukage was
used.Slows and hastes were also available.
I would suggest that due to the length of the encounter-KEI is needed for
the casters otherwise by the time the named guy spawns you will have little
left.Although I do recall a Druid saying he was kiting him to buy time.

Bullet points are; precamp the spawnpoints; control the dwarf army; be ready
to be mobile fast to intercept new spawns and runners(Your forces will be
split initially). Sort out comms as usual-the whole raid may need to know
where to go at a moments notice-hard to do if yr channel is blocked by
irrelevant chat. If you are lucky enough to be able to spare a few people or
people realise whats happening and ask if they can help- a last reserve near
Thurg to catch any runners that slip through would probably help.

This stuff just comes from my own personal observations of the one time I
saw it done-I am no expert.I'm sure someone out there knows much better than
me!
