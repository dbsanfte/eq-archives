Yeah, but nude is SO much more fun in a group... especially with comely Half
Elven Druids.

As for Equipment at 30...

Hmm... JBoots are really handy, though unless you have a guild or a tight
group of friedns, the AC camp is just out of your reach.

I'd suggest you start with our website... look at equipment, what drops it,
cross reference with alakazam, and everlore, see what you can take.  Quests
page is handy too.

I waited until 31 (just wanted to be out of a hell level before questing)
but if you don't have a Staff of the Wheel, yet... with a lot of courage, a
maxed swim and divination skill, an enduring breath for lake rathe, and an
invis vs undead for LGuk, and you should be able to pick up +10 int, no
drop, lore primary hand 1hb.

FBR in Najena if you don't have it, can be done with a good group... though
it's handy if you can get into her room without having to do all the key
stuff.

hmmm... obviously if you don't have band of rodcet nife or better, go to
Qeynos, and make nice with the piests of life.  While you're there go kill
Cubert in the aqueducts a couple million times, and get your +3 int
earings...

A lot of my recomendations depend on what you have already, and what you can
muster for help...
