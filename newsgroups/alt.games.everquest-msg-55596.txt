I wouldn't reccomend kunark at 14.  You just got your new spells and they
suck up your mana right now.  What is you conjure at?  I would wait at least
until 16 or 17 and then hunt in the area leading to Cabilis, not by the
windmill.  With SOW, you can make it to the FV zone line if you have too,
and you won't have many high level baddies taking you out on the way.

You can hunt iksar bandits, ice bones (I think that's what they're called)
and tiger(ettes or whatever is blue/even).  As someone else said, up to 20
is pretty much solo time in LOIO.

Personally, I would say that if you have a good video card, go to Warsilks
woods and hunt.  A lot less people and at 17 lots of blues and evens near
the zone line.  If you don't have a good video card, you either have to set
it so you can't see 10 feet in front of you or you get sea sick.  Lot's of
leaves shaking in the breeze.

If kunark isn't a must, go to EK and hunt from the bridge.  Nice xp and pp.
