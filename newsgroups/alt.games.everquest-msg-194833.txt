I started off always running clockwise, now I do counter-clockwise.  As
Lance mentions below, I also do figure eights if I'm feeling really crazy.
I find if I put the auto run on (numlock) and just drive with my cursers it
helps somewhat.

My wrist has been getting sore lately from twisting so I've taken a week off
for now.  I try using different techniques to mix up the muscle usage but I
may just have to turn to a tensor bandage :)
