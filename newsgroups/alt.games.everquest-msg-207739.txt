Hmmm...never thought of that method.  That might actually work with a
Wizard, at least for PLing at the lower levels.  I can DS myself, and I've
got a way to pull without damage (Staff of Temperate Flux), and even though
Wizards aren't known for AC and HP, for mobs 40 levels lower or so, we've
got enough.  If I ever try two-boxing again, I think I'll try that.
