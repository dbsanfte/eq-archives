I never considered what race a person is in the Bazaar either. Maybe it 
would help picking them out in the must-get-my-ass-as-close-to-the-bank-
as-possible crowd of merchants. Do those people just not understand that 
there is no encumberance in the Bazaar and therefore, no need to set up 
shop right next to the bank? Or do some customers really make a habit of 
just wandering along "window shopping" by clicking on each merchant 
nearby?
