   Can be stored in Medium and larger containers                 

Be warned: I killed Gorehorn with my level 54 Shaman. Was of course easy, but
I still was astonished, how much resist the guy gave me. Gorehorn is a
*massive* undercon. He dualhits for 66 consistently, he has a very high MR
(I could not get normal slow or malosi to stick, disease based level 54 slow
however stuck), he will backstab you badly if you run and he's fast. Don't
try this guy solo if you have its level.
