Certainly pay or donate is better than a buff beggar. But if you intend to
pay I am glad you state it.
When I offer a donation its what I intend.
If I am getting a SoW from a level 9 shaman an do my inspection shows a non
twink.
I will donate spare loot such as FS or armor.
From a high teens low 20's character plat for spells is often best.
A DMF stacks of bone chips and words. Higher Levels dropped spells.
I have gotten more rezzes with peridots than plat.
Hmmm actually I say I am trading peridots for res.
I guess I see donate pay and trade as quite interchangeable.
Both parties get something they want.
With buff and item beggars the game world is all about them.
