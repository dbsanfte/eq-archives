I always seem to get them after having my trader for
long periods of time. Like, overnight. If I try to
camp and bring another character up, more likely than
not, it will crash pretty quickly after I enter the
game. But, that's been easily taken care of by peri-
odically exiting from the game completely and shutting
the computer down entirely. Don't know if the shutting
down of the computer is required, but I do it anyway.
