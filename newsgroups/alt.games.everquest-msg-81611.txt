OK, maybe it's just me, but I am getting SOOO damn tired of trying to 
travel places in Norrath and Luclin with people who don't know how to 
travel.  
First, sense heading, use it, practice, keep it maxxed.  Use it every time 
it is available, learn the zones, know that Kelethin is north of the 
spires, that Paineel is south of the ports, etc.  
Second, LOC, it's fucking simple!  OK, so E/W has positive numbers to the 
west, which was confusing the first day I got the game, but I can't 
believe how many level 60 characters can't find a damn LOC.  Compare your 
LOC with the LOC you want to reach, if the first number is higher at your 
destination, you need to go north, if it's lower, you need to go south.  
Now compare the second numbers, if you need to be at a higher number, go 
west, if you need to be at a lower number, go east.  (Remember, 0 is 
higher than neg10,000, and neg5000 is higher than neg10,000.)  For 
advanced students, learn that you don't have to go north then west, you 
can actually head northwest and get there faster!
Third, auto-follow is your friend, but learn to use it.  If you lag a lot, 
learn to look at the ground, or switch out to 3rd person view.  Pay 
attention to who you are supposed to be following.  Unless SPECIFICALLY 
told to do so, NEVER /FOLLOW THE BARD!  If someone says to click off SOW, 
please click it off.  Yes, this includes jboots and your stupid little 
pony too.
Finally, if you are the person that people are /following, pay attention, 
don't go AFK while running, and if you don't know the way, ask or look it 
up.  If you are being directed from someone who is following (i.e. the 
bard), learn what left and right mean.  Assume that if someone says turn 
left, they mean 90 degrees, not 10 degrees, not 180 degrees, but 90 
degrees.  If you don't know what half-left means, ask!  Don't assume it 
means spin in a circle.
Follow these simple rules and you'll get to your destination faster, with 
less stress, and a lot less chance of some bard snapping and going postal 
because of all those levels spent running mail back and forth to the wrong 
damn person.  
Now what would cause me to rant like this?  Trying to do an MQ with a 
guildmate in Timerous Deep.  I logged on to do the MQ, and was located in 
Great Divide.  Yes, I'm a bard, and yes, I am an experienced land 
traveler, but why did it take me 25 minutes to go from Velks to GD to 
Nexes, to DL, to FV, to TD, and it took my guildmate who started in Kael 
90 minutes more?  OK, he only has jboots, but that will maybe add 20 
minutes in run time.  Good thing I like these people.
