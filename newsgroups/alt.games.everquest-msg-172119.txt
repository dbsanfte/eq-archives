I have an IBM Thinkpad with a S3 Super Savage graphics card.  EQ will
run and actually runs quite nicely, the problem is the gamma (I assume
it's the gamma, maybe not).

I can't see squat in a dungeon nor outdoors at night.  Outdoors
daytime is ok.  I've tried adjusting the monitor (brightness and
contrast), tried adjusting the card settings for those as well.  I
tried adjusting the gamma in EQ and in the cards settings, nothing is
helping.

Anyone have a fix?
