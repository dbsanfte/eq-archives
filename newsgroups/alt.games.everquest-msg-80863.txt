Hmmhmmm. Now Tormax ain't easy at all .. yet you deliberatly brag :) AoW
is *real* hard, yet you say it dropped on first attempt. Now I don't know
the Zeb server or your guild, but I'm open to hear your strategy. Tormax
is new to us and with about 60 people (20 of them level 60), we were able
to bring him down to about 55%. The MA's wear mostly SS armour, and I think
we had about 6 clerics there with CH chains. We fought at a nice spot in
a perfect halfcircle and never lost aggro or anything. 

What is it that gets you through so easily? Do you raid him (or the AoW
for that matter) with 100 people? Or you got 15 clerics on the place?
Or 12 wizards with GB spells, a million rogues? 

I'm a bit puzzled by the coolness you put into those statements, as those 
mobs are real hard .. to about any guild I know.
