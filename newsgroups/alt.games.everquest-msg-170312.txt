Yes, it can be done.  I've done it many times, following and being followed.

Trick is for the person in the lead to toggle Walk on (and you thought that was
just an utterly useless button)

In complicated areas, everyone must pilot themselves, stick as close as possible
to the leader at all times

In easy areas, such as outdoor crossings, Autofollow can be used.  With leader
walking and everyone else running, this STILL fails a lot, because max
autofollow distance is outside the incredibly short invis range.  So you must
use a second trick: hold down the forward key.  This makes you continue to move
forward until you are on top of the leader (assuming you are faster than him)
but not past him, and does not break autofollow.

Either way, the effect is a dog pile on the leader, and if noone lags out, you
get the safest group invis in the game.

If you aren't using bard invis as your invis method, then a bard in your group
using it on himself is going to screw your invis up royally, so disband his
asterisk before moving.  The bard may very well want to use his invis song
though for himself, because its  FAR more reliable than any invis anyone can
cast on him.  There is a very tiny chance that he'll miss three notes in a row
and lose the invis... but I've never seen it happen, and you do get a warning on
miss one and miss two.. two in a row and you have 6 seconds to find  a safe spot
in case you eat the magic bullet on that third pulse.
