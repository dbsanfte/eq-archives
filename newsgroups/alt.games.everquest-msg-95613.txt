pet damage has been known for quite a while.  The simple rule is

Solo with a pet:
pet does <= 50% damage, it takes 0 exp
pet does > 50% damage, it gets half exp

Group with pet:
if any persons pet can do > 50% damage, it takes exp as if it were
a member of the group
if no pet gets > 50% than no pet recieves any experience.

This is why some pet classes find it more beneficial to duo rather
than solo.  With 2 people + pet(s), it is harder for a single pet to
do more than half the total damage to the mob, and it takes no exp.

and when i say a pet "takes experience as a member of the group", what i
mean is say you have a 4 person group, all level 20, and one person has a
level 16 pet.  Everyone sits down while the pet kills something, so it gets
more than 50% damage.  When experience is split up, it is split like you
were
a 5 person group of 4 20's and a 16, and the split that goes to the 16 just
dissapears.  So say this group killed a lvl 23 mob in some outdoor zone,
if the pet does not get 50% total damage, the group gets the following exp:

4 person group, Nec, SK, War and Wiz.  nec has pet up.
10 % group bonus for 4 players

lvl 23 mob gives 39,675 exp
Nec : 12001 exp (1.1 class modifier)
SK:  15275 exp (1.4 class modifier)
War: 10911 exp (1.0 class mod (for exp awards, .9 modifier for level reqs)
Wiz: 12001 exp (1.1 class modifier)
( you may note that the exp does add up to toal mob exp, this is because VI
makes up exp for any class that has a penalty so each class gets the same %
of thier levels exp requirement.  ie, everones exp bar moves the same)

now take that same group, but the pet did do 51% damage
lvl 23 mob gives 39,675 exp     43642.5
Nec : 9918 exp
SK:  10279 exp
War: 9017 exp
Wiz:  9918 exp
Pet: 7574 exp

if anyone would like clarification of how i arrived at these values, feel
free to ask, i have a length file i could post that explains most of the
formulas and how to apply them.
