Hi,

I've just bought Everquest and I'm having real problems trying to get into
the game. I've installed the game, ran through the tutorial and downloaded
all the patches and files before I get started.

I've then gone to the part where I have to set up my account but I can't get
past it because my account key isn't accepted and I keep on getting an error
0035 or something like that message appearing asking me if I've typed it in
properly.

I've e-mailed the help desk and I'm waiting to hear from then but can
someone give me a little help?

I don't have anything to say what my account key is. There is a white label
stuck to the inside of the DVD case that the game came in on the top tight
hand corner, where the CD is housed. It reads EVERQUEST KUNARK and
underneath it is an 11 character code which contains letters and numbers. Is
this the account key the site talks about?

If it is then I've tried all the combinations I know of as I read that
sometimes 0's are confused with O's and I's and 1's.

Any help would be appreciated as looking at the tutorial it looks a great
game and I can't wait to start playing it.

Thanks,

Derek
