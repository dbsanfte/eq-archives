I've done trade skills "for fun" before. And I'm sure I will again.
However, this is my first character on a new server who can't tap in to
the 10K PP or so my troll has over on Xev. I need better armor before I
can move into Kurns tower with any confidence. I haven't saved up enough
yet to get my smithing up and make a suit, but if I negotiate well, I
may be able to buy a set.

So...... if you're on Innoruuk, have a master smithing skill and are
bored....
/em looks like a hopeful puppy dog... errr... lizard dog.
Shoot a tell to Jazix. I'll give you my stash of spare change and
wash/wax your horse for you.
