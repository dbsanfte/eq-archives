Hey I'm down with that. No feign pulling, no lulling, nothing wrong
with that especially if the game is designed for it.

What gets me is that it TELLS you BEFOREHAND what will come. It tells
you beforehand if you're up against an undercon. It tells you
beforehand so you don't have to learn the hard way!

That's where the skill is being lost.

That's exactly the point. If enchanters are the sole form of crowd
control but make encounters so much easier (as CC tends to do), then
enchanters become almost "required", from certain points of view.

You say that mezzing is as useful as ever but then now say that its
just useful but not required. These statements are not jiving. Is it
balanced with the idea that the players will be able to fight them one
by one? If so, what is the penalty for not using CC? If not, how much
easier does the fight get when you do?

Once again just to make sure this is clear, it is the foreknowledge
that is dumbing down the game, not the execution.
