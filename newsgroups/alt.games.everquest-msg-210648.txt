Thurgadin faction is race/class/religion independant.  You start out Dubious and
get better (or worse, depending on what you do) via quests or killing.  Kael
Drakkar faction is also race independant, everyone starts KOS and improves (or
worsens) via quest or killing... with one exception, Rallos Zek worshippers start
out dubious with at least the two "normal" giant factions there.  Skyshrine is the
same story, nothing matters, except I'm told that Veeshan worshippers start non
KOS (only bards can worship Veeshan AFAIK)

This means that thurg potions are good right up until you move to giant faction...
and I've known people to go to the trouble of repairing their thurg faction after
their guild was done with giants quests simply for the ease of an easily replaced
emergency gate system.

Personally, I'd think it better to get a OT hammer so you don't have to screw
around with replacing a one shot lore item every time you use it; instead of
emergency use, people who have that OT hammer use it as casually as my cleric uses
his faithstone and my shaman uses his spiritstone.

With some method of gating out the OP can move his bind spot to Gunthak (there's a
soulbinder there) and leave a gate method in the bank...
