Multi-questing is pretty simple -
- -  Person A (who has object and doesn't want or need the final item)
hands in first part to NPC (if his/her faction is good enough)
- - Person B (who wants the final product/item) hands in the other
component(s) and if their faction is good enough will complete the
quest and recieve the final item.

NOTE: there can be more than 1 person A, if there is more than 2 parts
to be handed in, only the final person handing in will recieve item
and faction (if there is any faction to be gained).
