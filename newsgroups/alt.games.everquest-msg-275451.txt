I can't even remember the last time I paid for a port to anywhere.  What 
was the point when I could run there just as fast as actually finding 
someone to port me?  The only times I actually get a port are when the 
guild is porting as a whole for a raid, so now, instead of our guild 
porters having to figure out how to most efficiently do this, we can just 
use the portal.  I have given up on worrying about the fact that they are 
just making the game easier and easier.  I mostly only play to raid 
anymore, and for that purpose, the changes are handy.

You left out the augement birdbaths that are in the guild hall, damned 
handy I think.
