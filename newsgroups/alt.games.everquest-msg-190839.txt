Once upon a time, I was splitting the siren house in SG.  A building of 8?
high level enchanters and clerics, and a level 60 princess.

This place was as rough as exp groups got!  The splitting was difficult,
deaths were easy to come by (so many chain casters with insanely high melee
damage)

On a particular pull it went something like-

Agro
Press Fd
"You have been hit for 900 points non melee, you are no longer feigning"
Press Fd
"You have been hit for 1200 points non melee, you are no longer feigning"
Press Fd
"You have been hit for 900 points non melee, you are no longer feigning"
Meleed for.. <a lot>
200hp left.. oh shit im dead...
Argh it charmed me, now I've lost all control.. im dead for sure!
"You have been completely healed!"
