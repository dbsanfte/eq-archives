I meant making the beast lord, not the pet. Bad humour, sorry :)

Heres an example, when im running my monk (and duel boxing the cleric) in
Velk (50-60 dungeon) I can pull 4 mobs at once kill them all (with cheals)
and the cleric is still at 95m or more.

maybe its just a 50+ thing, I forget when it changed, but you don't use all
of your mana for just 1 fight.  Excluding buffing and wipeouts, there should
be very little downtime in groups, for consistant, never ending *managable*
sized pulls

My cleric uses less mana just with my monk, than if Im grouped with any
other melee (even a rogue).  When im "solo" all agro is on me, nobody else
to waste mana on healing, no multiple people getting hurt (so having to use
fast heals, heals over time) I just cast cheal at the right point

I remember one time in Sebilis (early 50's pickup group).. I chose a warrior
for MA, and a SK for snares.

The SK decided he wanted to tank though, so with the warrior taunting and
the SK using spells, the mobs pingponged between them. Net result, both of
them needed cheals after each fight (or fast heal 1, cheal the other, then
cheal the first)

Crappy exp, constantly having to rest for the cleric to med.. finally the SK
was kicked out when he repeatedly refused to stop tanking. Less people, but
boy did we do soo much better
