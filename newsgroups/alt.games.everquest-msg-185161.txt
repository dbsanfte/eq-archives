Whether or not I am sending position updates, I am sending data.  If I
were not, the server would have no way to know I wasn't linkdead.  In
other words, if a person stopped moving, chatting, casting, or
attacking, they would start to go linkdead.  The server has to be told
that you are still online and the only way to do that is for my client
to send it information.
