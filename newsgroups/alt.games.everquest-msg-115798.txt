    Wrong. It took a while, but at
http://everquest.station.sony.com/library/atlas/antonica.jsp there's a nice
map of Antonica. Rivervale borders Kithicor Forest, which borders Nektulos
Forest directly. Not a human in sight, unless you count a few rangers in log
cabins. That map may not look the way the zones are situated in game (look
at the area near Oggok to see how messed up it is), but it is canon.

    Wow, that sounds like... High Elves and Sal'Varae's Robe! The exact
piece of equipment I mentioned! I HAVE seen this happen, and I DID NOT whine
about it because that accomplishes nothing. Nor did I moan about High Elves
getting all the PoG gear while my deity has no equivalent gear. When the
Plane of Underfoot is added, then I'll have my quests, and that's more than
fine.

    So there is a downside.

    You can also use Karana-restricted items if you're a ranger of Karana.
At present, that's a limited number of items. After Karana's plane is
introduced in PoP I imagine you'll see more, similar to the quests in PoG
for Tunare followers.

    Poor thing. Would you like a cookie?

    So you created your character just because you thought he'd get an XP
bonus over other rangers? You regard all of human cultural smithing as "no
racial skills"? You think GFAY (dark even with Infravision, almost no
landmarks) is better to start in than the Qeynos Hills area? You're really
starting to make me wonder here!
