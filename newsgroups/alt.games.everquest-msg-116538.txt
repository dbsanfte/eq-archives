Actually that is true in non-full screen mode (normal windowed mode where
you've got the other stuff around the window).  Hit the F10 key to go into
full screen mode where the chat and other windows you see there
(non-inventory stuff) is transparent.  Hit F10 again to go into full screen
mode where all windows are gone (screenshot mode is more like it, good for
taking screenshots since nothing is on the screen, just what your character
is seeing, or your camera angle is seeing).  Then hit F10 again to return to
the first screen.
    Also your question of adjusting the monitor to prevent the black space.
Yes, there is a setting that can be done.  I believe it was either in the
INI file with other settings, or in display.  But you have an option to make
that windowed mode be same resolution as everything else.  Default is yes,
which causes black space (as the window is only 640x480).  Setting it to no
causes your monitor to switch to 640x480 when viewing that screen.
Naturally this will cause a slight delay when you go into your spellbook, as
your computer will have to change from it's screen resolution back to
640x480 (same delay you see when toggling screen resolutions), and then the
delay again as you return to higher resolution mode, when leaving that view.
    Also there is a setting in the INI file that can cause you to log into
EQ in the full screen mode, rather than starting in the windowed mode
(basicly avoid's you from having to hit F10 after logging on).  Thats more
of a permanent change, where you have to exit EQ and change it in the INI
file again for it to take effect (not like any of the other in-game changes,
you won't see it until you restart EQ).
    And off topic, but related to last comment, another setting allows you
to START EQ in RUN mode (I believe it's something like RUN=0 and you just
change it to RUN=1).  That avoids you having to hit your RUN button/hotkey
when you enter EQ.
