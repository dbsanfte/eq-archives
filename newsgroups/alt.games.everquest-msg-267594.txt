And that isn't what is happening. So what's the panic.

There simply isn't -that- much traffic. We haven't picked up 5000 eq2 
newbies posting all sorts of questins. 

There are likely more posts made by you, advocating a new group, then 
there are -threads- started by -non-regulars- on EQ2. We aren't being 
swamped by eq2 noobs.

And we don't know if the traffic is going to die off soon anyways. Most 
EQ2 players, especially the newbies are going to end up on the various 
web boards.
