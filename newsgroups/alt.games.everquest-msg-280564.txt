Personally if I was 2-boxing on one machine I would just install macroquest, 
yes I know it is "cheating" but you don't need to use any of the things that 
give you an advantage other than the spell casting.
Just make a macro that runs on the second machine that when it gets a tell 
from you, to heal you. Or buf you etc. I two box on 2 machines so it is real 
easy I use the n52 (great addition) hooked up to the second machine and 
almost never look at the screen.
