I was making an example of how to simplify the group/solo content problem. 
The more in your party the higher mobs can be fought and the tougher quest 
can be started sooner.

Most previous mmog I played it was not a case of no group no game but we now 
have a grp what higher challenges shall we attempt.

Why not? Though as I said it was only an example of the fact that a grp can 
now up a bit in the challenge stakes.
