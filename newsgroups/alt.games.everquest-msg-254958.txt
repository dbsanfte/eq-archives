Far more imporant than the progressions are the caps: Wiz casters cap 
melee at 110 (around 32nd) and do not increase that cap ever. Melee 
classes blow by 110 around 22nd level, and tend to cap in their 40s, 
until they reach 50 and then cap shortly thereafter again in the mid 200s.

You essentially lag behind true melee classes by some 10-20 levels, with 
poor melee stats, and no melee abilities. You tend to be less effective 
at pure melee than a shadowknight pet...
