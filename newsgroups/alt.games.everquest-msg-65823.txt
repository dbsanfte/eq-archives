And they've gotten it. You're receiving no special treatment here,
trust me. A few people whining, I wouldn't have said anything. But
when this newsgroup is flooded with a barrage of threads whining about
the SAME FUCKING THING and NOTHING is being accomplished in these
threads besides a bunch of mudslinging, it gets old fast. Your
contribution to the bullshit was totally unecissary and unwanted.
