Hey all,

I'm currently working on an MMORPG design, and things are coming along
great. Graphics engine basics are nearly done, and I'm going to be
moving to the rudementary game logic fairly soon, set up all the
foundations.

Now, what I'd truly love however beyond my own & my artists ideas, are
inputs from everyone else. So, if there are people who'd like to
contribute, please let me know, and I will be happy to post more
information and questions that I have to this community.

If you all however consider this spam and just wanna torch me, kill
me, and torture me over it...well then I won't. :)

So...let me know ;) I'd truly love some input from everyone here to
help get things done right. If you've wanted a chance to influence a
mmorpg design from nearly day 1, well, here is your chance.
