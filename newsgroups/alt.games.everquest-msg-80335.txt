Yes necros can locate corpse too but its a spell and they have to keep
casting it every so often to get lined up to the direction corpse is
in. Bards locate corpse is much better by far!! 
They just play song and it automatically turns him/her to keep facing
direction of the corpse and keeps doing that till he stops playing it
or song ends due to a missed note. ;-)
