Which would that be?

I have "put a spare pet in my pocket" (suspend minion II).  Its handy, I 
suppose, but since the suspended pet vanishes if I zone or even get 
evaced, its not really as handy as all that; once upon a time it would 
have been great to stash a ready pet so as to pet canni.  Now, the best 
use I've had for it so far is to stash a pet so I can use Eye of Tallon, 
or to preserve buffs when moving back and forth between two distant 
camps in POJ.

There's Pet Hold.  Definately should NOT be an AA in my opinion, thats 
just stupid.  But even so, is it exciting?  To a non raider?  Getting a 
pet to not attack something I don't want it to is a slight help, but 
since he also won't attack what I -do- want him to, not much.  And guess 
what, its not cheap, its a class AA so there's 12 archetype AAs to buy 
before I can even think about it, and then its what, 6 more to buy it?

Outside GOD (which I don't own at the moment and may never own) those 
are the most exciting mage AA's I see.  In GOD there's one where group 
buffs and bard songs will hit my pet.  Again, should be that way for 
everyone, not having it work that way hurts bards desirability in 
groups, or pet classes desirability in bard groups.  Anyway, this one 
costs 20 aa!  20!  Imagine that.  Irritating.

Am I missing something really good?  The rest all seem either worthless, 
or no more than incremental improvements.

Its the "via raiding" part that really turns me off.  I've been a raider 
with previous characters, enough to get sick of the bickering, the 
delays, but worst of all, the endless repetition; you can't just do 
something a couple times, get it down, and then move on to something 
new, you need to do it again and again and again in order to gear up the 
whole guild before moving to the next step.  POP raiding might be more 
the ticket for me, if I'm not getting involved in endless backflagging, 
just going thru the progression up and up; I'm not against raids on 
principle, its the gritty reality of a raiding guild that gets me.

Coldain ring seems silly for a class that specializes in not getting 
hit, the shawl involves tons and tons of trade skills (oddly, I did the 
shawl up to silk with a friend.. but thats because on FV things were no 
drop, so I could gather the items and have a trade skiller do the 
combines.)  Epic, for a mage, is an incredible series of rare drop off 
rare spawn mobs, and on FV with the TLC in place, I'd need someone in 
raid mode with me for much of it.

Aye, pretty much the picks as I see em; keep on going, start over, or quit.

Splendid One, your pet keeps telling you to buy gear from me
