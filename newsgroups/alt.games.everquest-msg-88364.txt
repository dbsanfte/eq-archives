Send a tell to any of these characters in-game.  I know Pheilmi has one, 
and uses it, but you could borrow it.  I think Zymyool has one in the bank 
that you could use.  Pheilmi went to Kunark last night, though.  Zym is in 
the Gorge.  I'll log the different toons in and see else may have one.  I 
think Deus has one in the bank, also, unless I gave it away, and he is at 
the FP bank.
