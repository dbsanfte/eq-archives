Your are not beating your head against a tree. I have a 14th level
human Warrior with 75int, 79wis, 90str and 75cha. My smithing skill is
134. High stats are NOT a necessity for skilling up. Hight stats may
make it a little cheaper, or a little faster, but I've compared my
experiences to others with much higher stats and I've got no
complaints.

Another poster indicated that Wis determined success and Int
determined skill up (or something like that). That is not true. Your
current skill and the difficulty of an item determine success. The
highest of your Int or Wis determine skill up. Str above 140 (or was
it 160?) may help with skill up.

With a smithy skill of 80, stay in Freeport and make skewers till they
trivial at 115. There's a bit of zoning, but not much. Make a million
metal bits in N Freeport, then goto E Freeport for skewer molds (I
think that's where they are). After 115, you can move right into
banded or make sewing kits to 135. I found Erudin to be the best zone
for sewing kits. All the ingredients are in one zone. Making sewing
kits is a bit of a pain, as they are containers. You have to sell at
every 1 or 2 successes. I just started dropping them on the ground and
eventually got tired of making them (that's why my skill is 134, not
135 :)

Anyways, from Erudin, you are in excellent position to start making
money selling banded. Goto the house in Qeynos hills - they sell metal
sheets and medium banded molds - then to Halas to forge them into
armour. Halas and Everfrost are excellent zones for selling banded.
Barbs can wear medium and Shammies can wear banded. Lots of barbarian
Shammans around to sell to.

The last piece of banded (cloaks, i think) trivial at 175. Not sure
what to do after that. I've heard that HHP is the place to go for
further skill ups, but I'm not there yet, so I can't speak from
experience.

Regarding Tailoring. This one is a real bear to increase. The main
reason being that much of the ingredients have to be looted from
monsters. And the stuff you can make at lower skills is not good
enough to use or to sell. My skill is 37 and I make studded armour
whenever I get a MQ pelt and usually just give it to some newbie. If
they've got eggs or pelts or something, I'll take it in trade, but
don't demand it. I also make raw silk armour whenever I get the silks.
I've got almost a complete set I keep meaning to give to my Enchanter,
but he's in Felwithe, my Warrior's in Halas. hmm...

A good source of information on trade skills is www.eqtraders.com.
They have message boards for each trade skill with lots of people
willing to answer questions.

Hope that helps,
