With my spell list complete and one little tiny blue tick into 20, I 
logged in today and made my way to Paladul.  Zoned in, /ooc 20 chanter 
LFG will mez for food, got a B1 invite immediately.

Spent the next 5 hours at that camp, with a moveable feast of group 
mates coming in and replacing each other, varying from 4 to 6 of us at 
any given time.  When I hit 24 I said I'd leave as soon as we could find 
a haste caster for a replacement.  Two levels later I finally begged off 
and left them with no haster, because the mobs were half green by then.

I became intimately familiar with my group and single target mezzes.  I 
was afraid at one point I'd put Divination specialization over the 50 
line before anything else due to heavy use of my two PB AE stuns.  Whirl 
Till you Hurl sucks, I really want a single target stun that works like 
my cleric ones, although the AE stuns are useful and cheap.  In melee 
heavy groups there were points where I literally didn't get all the mana 
back from casting a round of hastes before haste wore off again... and 
thats with Quickness, I shudder to think whats going to happen with 
Alacrity!  I'd like my money back on my extended enhancement item, 
because I can hardly imagine that that is -extended- haste!

I did not use slow much at all; mobs died too fast.  I did not use lull 
pulling, mobs were welcome to come in as large a cluster as they wanted.

I did heavily rely on targetable AE mez, once people were trained to 
keep the mobs in close formation, this meant I could mez them all and 
they could freely pick whichever target or targets they wanted, one at a 
time or one per tank, I didn't care.

I died only once, when someone trained all of B2 on us early on and the 
group didn't have the "get the mobs together" plan down; I couldn't get 
them all mezed at once or stunned at once and the damage I was taking 
from all the angry uncontrolleds got too high for the cleric to keep up 
with (she made a valiant effort, I went from around 5% hp to full HP 
three distinct times in a row)

I mezed myself quite a few times, sometimes by mistake, sometimes 
because "get in there, AE stun, then AE mez and hope I resist" was the 
only plan that seemed like it might work.

My pet didn't get a great workout, but he did do yeoman work when the 
group was small and light on tanks, or when I got aggro from the odd 
uncontrolled; didn't have to have a "taunter" tank assigned to me since 
the pet could almost always get the mobs off me when necessary.  If I 
was FM and mobs were dying slowly I could root, close in tight to get 
hit, and back off to add pet DPS... but I rarely bothered hasting him 
because this didn't happen all that much.

Lets see, I nuked rarely (and with a small nuke, they are expensive 
enough and my skill is low so I fizzle more than I'd like to think with 
larger ones) DOTed less (Choke is still my best DOT, and while it was 
impressive earlier, its pretty inconsequential now) and used melee stat 
or resist debuffs not at all.

I played with Berserker Strength a little, 50 point damage absorbtion 
seems like a joke, I wasn't getting hit lightly enough for this to mean 
much of anything, and recast time and mana cost made chain casting it as 
an emergency "heal" (absorb damage the tank is taking is like heals in 
advance I figured) pretty worthless too.

What else.   Hmm, that seems to be about it really.

Oh, after I left and got my 24 spells finally, I went to Marus Seru 
where I made about a yellow in an hour, and then to CC where I got the 
rest of 27 in another hour (different group).  In the meantime, a friend 
who'd been in the PC group got 27 and 28 and 29 all in Marus Seru 
(includes the time I spent getting spells)... so group composition does 
matter.
