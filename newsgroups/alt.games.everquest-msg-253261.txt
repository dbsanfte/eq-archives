	I know more than one person who acts (and dresses etc.) in
public society as a member of the other gender.  (They're not all men
"pretending" to be women, either.)  Are they lying, or role playing,
or sick fucks, or what?  Personally, I don't care.  When she's Roberta
I treat her as a woman, and when he's Robert I treat him as a man.  What's
the problem?

	Now, yes, if we had an intimate relationship we might have to make 
some decisions, but ordinary daily interactions seem to work out fine. And
since EQ interaction is even _less_ intimate than a lunch date you can
imagine that I don't see why the real actual gender of the person driving
matters much at all.
