>Well, I can get into my old account with no trouble. I just can't go to
Kunark because the expansion isn't on -this- computer. I also have the
original, of course, and SoL, and the new textures. I was mostly just
wondering about the hunting grounds. Since I have an up and coming Druid, I
thought it might be a good idea to have other places for her to go besides
Luclin and Norrath :)
