I'm a 22 Druid ,and a friend of mine said I should go "Overthere".Now on the
map I got from EQ atlas the docks are on the far left side,where as I'm told
they are guarded and I would be kos before I even got off the boat.My
question is..does the boat come from the right hand side(east side it looks
like).If so I'm guessing to jump of the boat and swim to shore.And is it
worth it for a 22 Druid to risk the dangerous journey there?
