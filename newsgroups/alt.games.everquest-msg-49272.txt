Well, there's no difference in how quickly someone gains experience based on
race AND zone. Err what I mean is, a wood elf in everfrost would do as well
as a barbarian in gfay.  My brain isn't wrapping around the answer to
whether or not there's a racial penalty, but I think so.  But that racial
penalty applies whether they're in their newbie zone or someone else's.

If it's time for a change of scenery then go.  You don't need to come up
with excuses. <g>
