That's three references to your belief that wizard ports are obsolete.
I totally disagree. It's a *whole* lot better to venture deep into a
dungeon with the knowledge that there is an evac available to save
your butt and a port available to keep you from having to fight your
way right back out again when the night's festivities are over.

So there is a class that can solo better than the wizard. So what?!
See if you can find a warrior, rogue or monk willing to offer you a
shoulder to cry on.

Yes it is. So a mage comes pretty close at 44. Big deal. As I
understand it, the higher level wizard nuke crits are pretty darned
impressive. I "prolly" won't see many fixes or new abilities for the
wizard "prolly" because they aren't warranted. They already do some
pretty awesome damage as it is.

Ok. Enough. You've crossed the line into neurotic ranting here. I have
*never* seen *any* class community demonstrate a concensus by just
sitting back and ignoring changes that were a percieved by the
majority to be detrimental to their class. Never. If anything is
damaging the wizard class here, it is the Chicken Littles running
around ignoring what may be best for the game as a whole.

Mages were improved because they needed it, plain and simple.
