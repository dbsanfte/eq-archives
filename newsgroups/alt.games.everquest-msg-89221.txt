From the 2/18/2002 San Diego "Union-Tribune":

====================

BIOBYTES:  KELLY FLOCK, PRESIDENT/CEO OF SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT

Flock has been head of the San Diego-based online gaming division of
Sony since May 2000, and oversees The Station, Sony's Web site for
online gameplaying.  Flock helped to create EverQuest, the online
role-playing game that has been phenomenally successful.

FAVORITE WEB SITES

The Onion
http://www.theonion.com

"People have suggested that I'm occasionally cynical.  The Onion has
well-written satire that covers the gambit of politics, video games
and culture.  I get a good laugh when I go there."  The site's news
archives cover everything from computers to music to sports.

eBay
http://www.ebay.com

The auction site sells just about anything and Flock checks here to
"make sure people aren't selling their EverQuest characters."  A
recent look at eBay showed nearly 300 EverQuest-related items.

NHL.com
http://www.nhl.com

This is the official site for the National Hockey League and its
teams, including the Los Angeles Kings.  "Hockey is truly the sport of
Kings--Kings with a few missing teeth," Flock says.

The Station
http://www.station.com

"I like to play our free games--when I'm not busy, of course."
