    Remember the damage shield these guys have. Melees, especially ones dual
wielding, tend to get banged up a lot by mobs with damage shields, even 2
point ones. I don't know if their AC is buggy or not, or if they're just
buffed with HP buffs by the other bandits, but the "lower health" thing
isn't a good way to tell.
