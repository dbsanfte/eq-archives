Anyone suggest where I can p-level my cleric with a 51 Beastlord? So
far I've done:

1-25 Paludal Caverns

26 and up I haven't figured a place yet. I tried Upper Guk (ZEM bonus
was great) but place was too compact and runners were a problem. Any
other suggestions?

I've provided the Cleric with the weap from Stronghorn (18/30 and no
rec levels which was a big plus) and a 41% haste item loaned from
Beastlord.

Thanks.
