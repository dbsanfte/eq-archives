So, The Serpent's Spire has been released, and Sony delivers another set of
single group warrior armour for consideration. It should come as no
surprise that this armour outclasses the OoW single group armour which is
now a couple of years old.

The armour comes in several tiers, for use at several levels, but the two
I'll focus on are what people are referring to as tier1 and tier2. These
are the level 71+ quested armours (tier1) and their subsequent upgrades
(tier2). There are lower level armours, and there are better raid-acquired
quest armours, but I'll just look at the single group version, Marred Plate
something, and their upgrade, Battle-Marred Plate something.

First, our ever present totals,

                            AC     HP      Minimum Required Level
First Order                 347    910     70
Grandmaster's Stormguard    452    1040    65
Armsmaster's                395    975     60
Raex's                      492    1335    65
Blessed Champion            442    1160    68
Marred                      482    1795    71
Battle-Marred               482    1795    71


Three things jump out from that. Firstly, no single group armour to date,
beats even the PoP Raid armour for raw AC. The Raex's armour still has
higher AC, overall, than the TSS Armour. Secondly, in terms of raw
hitpoints, the improvement is huge with TSS. More than 600hp increase over
PoR and an impressive 460hp increase over the PoP raid armour.

The last thing, is that the Marred and Battle-Marred have identical AC and
HP values. This is because the 'only' effect of upgrading from Marred to
Battle-Marred is the inclusion of additional effects. By default, the
Marred armour has no shielding, avoidance, combat effects, dodge mods,
parry mods, damage shield, regen, etc., etc., etc. It is purely AC, HP,
Stats and Resists.

Even when you include DoN type 9/12 augs,

                            AC    HP      Minimum Required Level
First Order                 347   1200    70
Grandmaster's Stormguard    452   1330    70
Armsmaster's                395   975     60
Raex's                      492   1335    65
Blessed Champion            442   1160    68
Marred                      482   1795    71
Battle-Marred               482   1795    71


the new TSS armour is still ahead in hitpoints and AC over all of the
previous single group armours.

Additionally, since the Grandmaster's and First Order armour are required
70 when auged, the level 71 requirement on the Marred / Battle-Marred isn't
such an issue. However, the recommended level on Battle-Marred and Marred
armour is 75, so until then there will be some degredation in worn stats.

By slot, this is how it breaks down,

              Slot               chest legs wrist head hands feet arms
Armour set
First Order                ac    72    51   32    41   39    39   41
                           hp    125   125  115   110  105   110  105

Grandmaster's Stormguard   ac    99    81   32    59   45    45   59
                           hp    145   145  115   135  135   115  135

Armsmaster's               ac    78    57   38    47   45    45   47
                           hp    140   130  115   120  120   115  120

Blessed Champion           ac    87    63   42    54   50    50   54
                           hp    160   150  135   140  140   135  140

Marred                     ac    99    71   45    57   54    54   57
                           hp    240   235  215   225  225   220  220

Battle-Marred              ac    99    71   45    57   54    54   57
                           hp    240   235  215   225  225   220  220


A couple of the Grandmaster pieces beat the Marred in terms of AC, but this
is compensated by other slots. Nothing comes close for HP.

Not only is the Marred armour superior in raw stats to every other single
group armour set, the upgrade, Battle-Marred is leaps and bounds above the
other single group armour due to the additional mods.

Haste 40%, Spell Shielding 3%, DoT Shielding 3%, Attack 110, Combat Effects
8, Shielding 6%, Regen 13, Damage Shield 13, Avoidance 20, Strikethrough
5%, Accuracy 7, Cleave III, Truesight, Improved Dodge III

You can't easily obtain stats like that as a non-raiding warrior.

If your warrior is approaching level 71, you would be best spending all
your time killing TSS Tier 1 mold droppers, hunting the power sources to
upgrade them to Tier 2, and revelling in your new found AC and Hitpoints.
