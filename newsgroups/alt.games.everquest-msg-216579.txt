   I've read this whole thread, tedious as it has gotten, because I've
always been interested in what is going on in the mind of the puller I
sometimes have the misfortune to group with who insists on keeping me
continually lom.  I know that this thread is specific to LDoN, but I
thought that maybe it would provide insight to situations as well. 
Seeing Faned argue his points reminds of my own group experiences with
pullers who seem to operate the same way.  

   No amount of reasoning will work.  They pull they way they do because
it is fun for them, and they don't perceive it as being particularly
risky.  If something goes wrong and there is a TPW, then it is either
the cleric's fault for not managing their mana better or whatever, or
the wipe would have happened no matter how much mana the cleric would
have had, it was just one of those things.

   I am glad, Faned, that you have found a group of friends to hunt with
with whom your style of pulling is acceptable.  I would not be in my
group, or that of many other clerics out there.
