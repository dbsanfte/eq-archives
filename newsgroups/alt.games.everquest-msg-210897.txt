All good advice, and I've been reading the EQDiva EZboard regularly.  I 
actually tried a little bit of newbie kiting in the Shar Vahl pit 
around, um, level 8 or so, twisting Selo's and Chords of Dissonance. 
Worked up quite a sizeable little train for myself, too, but didn't get 
anything killed.  I'm guessing that CoD just doesn't have enough range, 
and I didn't do very well at timing the "drive-by."

Charming, lessee... won't be able to do that until 27 and Solon's Song 
of the Sirens.  It'll be a personal record if I get a character that 
high.  :)  My pet experiences so far have been with summoned pets, 
beastlords and necromancers, so I'm curious to experience the charmed 
pet side of things.  And, yeah, I know about swarming; read the guide to 
it several times.  I think I've got the theory, but whether I'll be able 
to put it into practice, well, only time will tell.  :)

I do like the bard, though.  Metal armor, swords, a song for every 
occasion, lots to do when fighting... and something to look forward to 
(a new song) every level!

I even finally managed to make that damned Jharin bowl (with a 52 skill 
at pottery) and got my upgraded cloak, plus buckler and drum -- both of 
which are secondary-slot items.  Hmm.  Well, the drum's better than the 
store-bought version, and the buckler'll help when I'm not using an 
instrument.

Now to start on the next stage and get the lute.  Mmm, lute.
