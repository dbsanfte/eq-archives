HAHAHAHA

if you're going to impose a bunch of details onto the characters, well . . .

why do most of the casters have the same mug ?


sure, in eq, that +10 int is good, but COME ON its a freaking mug of ale

they've got the hudspa to draw people casting 2 spells at once, wearing
armor that doesn't exist, and there's a shot of a guy dressed like robin
hood

why would you bother putting in a detail like the stein of moggok ? and on
several characters?


just organize an adobe slide show of your best screenshots, its FREE and
more valuable

hoping no one actually gives these people money

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
shot 1: first time you killed a kodiak
shot 2: first time you saw someone emote "moons you" while doing the /bow
animation
shot 3: that cool group from long ago where you fought 5 orcs at once and
all lived
shot 4: pic of yourself wearing your first GOOD piece of armor
shot 5: first time you ever saw a deity/giant/guard getting killed/dragon
shot 6: 60 necro scaring the HELL out of everyone with spec illusion (first
time it happens, its a doozy)
shot 7: that guy with the funny name
shot 8: deleting the 578 screenshots that take up something like 1.5 GB
