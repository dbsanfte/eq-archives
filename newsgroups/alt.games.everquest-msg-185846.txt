Was wondering of you can make a hotkey with your Range attack in it.  Just
wondering cause last night I was doing a bit of soloing with my Ranger doing
Root & Shoot, and was thinking about it, I asked a few Ranger Friends of
mine, but none of the tried it before. I want it so I can Sit, Shoot, Sit
cause that very little mana gain may help out in the long run.
