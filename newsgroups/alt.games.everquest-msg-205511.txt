as a ranger, you must be level 17 to equip two weapons at once...hit a
ranger guild trainer at level 17 and spend a training point, and you will be
able to equip (in secondary) any weapon you can normally equip (swords,
clubs, daggers etc)

the bow is a ranged weapon and fits in the ranged weapon slot...you can go
get a bow and equip it, then fire it with the ranged attack key, from your
hotkey bank...and arrows go in the ammo slot, next to it

  Still have lots to learn about hp and ac I

there is nothing to "know" really....get as much as you possibly can
