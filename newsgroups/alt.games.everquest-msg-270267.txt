Been playing since Feb '04 - not exactly what you would call a "uber 
gamer" - Don't get to play for hours on end, so Raiding is out of the 
question.  (or is it?)  I've only had one bad raid experience trying to 
get flagged for CoD. Don't have a mountain of plat etc.  Work 9-5 have a 
fiance' well.. I guess you get the point =) Casual gamer bascially.

I'm just looking for some good ideas as far as how to get better geared, 
find some fun high-end game stuff, and related.  My current guild kinda 
lacks the high-end game.  However I like the guild, and like the people 
in them.. leaving them for a uberguild would kinda suck.  (Don't want to 
cause hard feelings).  I'm running a pally and and when fully buffed I'm 
maxing around  5.3k hp.  Starting to feel some pain especially when I'm 
being called on to MT due to the crapy HPage (or is it crappy?) AC fully 
buffed averages 1.1k

Anywho, just wondering what A.G.E has to say about the situation, and 
their thoughts. Flame on if I sound like a total retard =p

Thanks in advance!
