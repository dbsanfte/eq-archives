He he he. Hoping we get some screenshots shortly of something from this
weekend. If so, I'll post a link here. One of our guilds mid fifties
bards logged into Cobalt Scar *very* early Sunday morning, and by some
act of the gods, she was the only person in the zone. (that's rare
enough to warrant a web page of it's own right there.)

Apparently, mischievousness overtook her, and she set herself a task to
start (and get a screenie of) the biggest train ever in CS. She was
somehow chatting to the couple of us online in guildchat (though poorly
and in short bursts) as she twisted songs and ran all over the zone. She
claimed to have every single wyvern and drake, including Yvolcarn and
Azzeurwhoever, all the otters exept the ones at the merchant camp, and
all the Bulthor following her in a merry train before she zoned. (Now
that I think about it, I forgot to ask whether she went for SS or SG.
hrmm.)

And before you comment, yes, I know it was a stupid thing to do and if
anybody ported in just after she zoned out they could have gotten a
nasty surprise, but it was still funny as hell.

Anyway, that must have been something to see. Bards. Pft. Go figure. :-)

RUN FORREST, RUN!
