No, I did some testing this week and found out that the level 44 spell, 
Color Skew, lasts less than 8 seconds, contrary to what Lucy says.  It 
seems to be around 6 seconds, maybe a bit more.  If anyone has better 
information, I'd be interested in hearing it.  Frankly I was surprised, 
because (apart from Lucy being wrong) it seems the level 20 Color Shift 
and the level 44 Color Skew do nearly the same thing.

And no, they don't overwrite mez since they don't do damage, though they 
do generate agro.

The AE stuns have a 12 second recast time and seem to get resisted 
enough that I always tash before stunning.
