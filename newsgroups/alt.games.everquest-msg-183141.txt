If using charm, have pet get agro and kill, keeping pet alive and hoping
charm doesn't break.

For non-charm soloing summoners, an easy mob to cut your teeth on is the
Corrupted Seafury Cyclops in OOT, so this guide will be to him.

Put up maximum regen (Nature's Recovery is your friend here), slap on DS for
a little extra damage.
Pull to shore with snare.
Root.  56 root can land once (maybe twice) before he'll start to summon.
Debuff (Hand of Ro/Ro's Illumination for me; RFS/fixation/RSD in your case)
Helps reduce mob dps, not worth worrying about refreshing midfight.
DoT overload; Winged Death, Fury of Ro, Breath of ro, etc.  Start with epic
dot though, it's cast time is long enough that you may have difficulty
refreshing it if you're getting summoned.
Once you're starting to get summoned, just back off out of melee range
immediately after summon, you should have enough time to cast one heal or
dot (2 chloroblasts if you're good) before next summon, after casting just
keep backing away (keep your front to the mob to reduce stun chance).
Throw in a nuke if you feel like it, but be prepared for root to break as a
result.

Using these tactics, I've soloed the corrupted elysian elder (being rooted
then summoned sux), entry lizards in CT (very high fire resist, skip the
debuff stage), PoI mininameds (the big buzzsaw hand guys that are semi rare
spawns and summon), some big golem in Sebilis near bugs, and of course our
gimpy friend, the corrupted seafury.
