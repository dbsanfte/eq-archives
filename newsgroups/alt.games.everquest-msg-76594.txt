Thanx for al, the advice.  These will be helpful.  I've been used to
playing Ultima Online and have had tons of fun with it, but EQ is
different (obviously) and I need to relearn a new game.  I just bought
the trilogy and the SoL expansion.  I created a human paladin and
can't wait to get started.  Is there any diff in each of the servers?
Is there a way to get a player count or ping time on them?
