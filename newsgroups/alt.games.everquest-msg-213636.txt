Consider it? Sure. I've got nothing against it. But most of the people I 
hang with are people I already knew. For what its worth, I find it 
exceedingly difficult to 'bond' with someone via toons and aliases. I 
could never pen&paper rp with someone who I only knew as Axxor the 
Necromancer... (and yeah I did encounter an rp group like that once) and 
likewise I rarely feel a connection to the people behind the toons, and 
would probably require an out of character interaction (at least real 
names and an email address... or something) before I would elevate 
anyone I encountered in EQ to a 'friend'. Its amazing (sad really) how 
uncomfortable people are about their real identities in EQ though so its 
a difficult step to take.

No.

Never been to a fan fair, and have no intention of ever going to one. 
SoE makes enough off me without me spending more money to satisfy their 
collective egos. I don't think EQ is a great game. I enjoy playing it 
for the social aspects, and for setting objectives for ourselves and 
then accomplishing them... almost 'in spite of Sony'.

Obviously not. :)
