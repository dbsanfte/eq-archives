   I don't, because I doubt that I could do so
convincingly.  
    My husband, however, does a great accent, if
you consider "troll stupid" to be an accent.  He's
mildly dislexic, and doesn't type well.  He reponds
to most questions and comments with phrases like
"Me Lenny troll."  "Me kill, humans, humans tastse 
good?" and of course, "Ogre taste good?", said
repeatedly to an ogre groupmate who was also
 trying to roleplay an accent, until said groupmate
lost his cooland told him shut the fuck up, he did
 not taste good and if Lenny tried anything, he would
be one dead troll.
   Ok, I know "stupid" may not count as an accent, 
but really, how else should a troll sound?
