I would post to some of the web trade boards saying something like
'trading equipment and plat on Luclin for stuff on <insert chosen server
here>'. Someone who is looking to switch servers *to* Luclin may be able
to work something out with you.

Also, you may want to look on everquest.station.sony.com for details of
character transfers. For $50 you could move your Paladin to another
server (except new servers or ones with different rulesets like the Zek
servers). He'd be transferred naked, so you'd still have to work out an
equipment/plat trade beforehand, but that may be preferable to starting
over.
