    How did that chap get in the position to be in a CHeal chain? Did
everyone /autofollow one person, who took them past all the mobs in the zone
to the one mob they needed that CH chain for? Is this person a chronic
AFK'er who somehow isn't punished for it by their guild because of their
non-existent contribution to the guild? How stupid do you think our leaders
are, anyways? I see the contributions of all our healers, as we have a
channel in which all heals are called. If anyone slacked off and wasn't
sharp, they'd hear about it from me - and I'm not an officer. As much as
you'd like to think we're all lemmings, we aren't.

    Funny story about weaning out the crap during recruiting - when running
from the zone-in of Kod'Taz to Ikkinz raid four, I noticed one recruit (a
caster) got auto-ducked when they ran too high on the wall. When we got to
the first pull point, still auto-ducked. So I mentioned it in guild chat, so
recruiters could keep an eye on them, and started to watch myself. Never
straightened up (and consequently never did a thing) in the 6 to 10 minutes
of fighting it took to clear to the zone into the raid instance. Wasn't on
auto-follow - was moving independently. As one person said, "Quality is job
one!" - the person got bounced from recruitment after double checking that
they didn't complain about suddenly being unable to cast in group.
