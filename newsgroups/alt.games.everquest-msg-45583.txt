Hi,

Any one else having problem staying in the game? was killed because of
lag in OT then logged back on cast my pet, get a green one , kill him
and cast another, good one sit down to med up, nice black screen comes
up again saying i have been disconnected *sigh* then i tried to play
on firiona vie, well got out in nektulos but when trying to get back
inside to sell some loot, got kicked out, and failed to get back in :(

If this keeps up i shure will burn my bonechips in a rapid pace :(

Now i go play AO for a while

/Regards Berth (Thotamon 6th circle DE necro luclin)
