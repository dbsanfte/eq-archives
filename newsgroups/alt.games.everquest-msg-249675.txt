Probably very few.   I can imagine there are quite a few who don't care or
support it, but don't post due to fear of getting bashed... but arguing for
a specific viewpoint while voting against it?   Why?  What on earth would
they gain out of that?   They enjoy arguing, but are afraid of being in the
minority viewpoint?   Doesn't make sense to me.

Very doubtful.  If I'm remembering correctly, this wouldn't be the first
time they posted a poll on a question where they had already made up thier
minds, then ignored the result.
