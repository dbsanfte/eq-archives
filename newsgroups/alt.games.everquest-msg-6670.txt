I've done it oh, 25 times, gotten about 15 ears.  other return is
hematite.  its about a 30 second spawn if you pop the Placeholders Giant
rat isn't a placeholder, the Mangy rat is.  basically if you are in the
area, anything that walks the path from that corner by the frogs all the
way to the other end and back is a PH.  Best place to stand is either on
the spawn, or on the corner where if you click the wall you target a
pet.  If you stand by the "pet" when the PH flees let them, they will
suicide on the zone line.
