Fact 1.  I stated I twinked my own characters.  I don't deny the fact that
I have done that with my low level characters.  Fact 2.  Throughout most of
the discussion, it was a discussion about discouraging newbie beggars.  Had
you followed some other discussions going on in the newsgroup, one message
did state some players actually made a lower level character to harass/beg
off other players, to scam them out of some nice items to turn around and
sell them to other players somewhere else.  Fact 3.  The issue at hand is
also to discourage beggars in general, the sense that seeing a Level 3
player wearing Full Plate with named weapons normally not bought through
the store...  Last thing you want, is someone on that same level, seeing a
twink and going, "Hey...  Can I have some of that?  How can I get it?"
First thing that comes out of most new generation players, especially ones
who have played RPGs before, is "Where do I get the money to get the better
stuff?"  Because one of the constants in most of the RPG games is that not
only are you outfited with some low level gear, you are outfitted with some
money to decide on where to focus on better gear.  My first experience with
EQ was just that, wondering what I needed to do inorder to get better
stuff.  While I did not 'beg' for stuff from players, others may feel the
need to do so by using ooc or shout to get said loot.  Fact 4.  There are
many people, like me for instance, who don't hassle people for SoWs, Buffs
or such, not unless it was offered or I had something to trade for it,
because I know people are not Pez Dispensers, they are not there for my own
personal support system.

I'm sorry, but you are deluding yourself if you really think Low Level True
Newbies don't know what 'Heck of a lot of damage' is.  When I compare my
cleric, the one who has a summoned 6/38 hammer from the first time I
played, back when I didn't have much knowledge, with a similar level, Dark
Ember 12/29 hammer, similar strength and compare the damage...  Hmmm... So,
I would hit, at most 13, with my piddly cleric back then...  Versus the 24
to 26 pts my new Cleric can do, same level...  The damage I could HARDLY do
with a 1HB, and barely do with a 2HB.  So, I wouldn't notice that, at the
same level, same skill, same STR and so on...  the 'heck of a lot of
damage'.  You don't need a log or parsing a log, with hitsmode off, which
is default off for a true newbie, to see a person, you can see plain as
day, looking at, conning even or even Blue, doing more damage than you
could with a similar type weapon.

Have you seen the prices for Full Plate or Chain from vendors?  At least
200+ plat per piece.  With about 10 slots to fill for armor, that is well
over 2-3k in plat.  The cost of a vendor wearpon, about 7 to 10 plat.  So
you are telling me...  a Level 2 or 3 newbie... Seeing a similar conned
twink won't wonder how to get the money to get enough plat to purchase one
item, when the mobs barely put out a GP to buy a stinkin backpack to carry
stuff, let alone feed yourself after the complimentary food and water is
gone.  Had you read the rest of my post, I have no major qualms about
twinking in general, but I see the point of where it can create problems
and where putting limits on some of the items to make it seem like Twinking
isn't going to make a person uber either.

No...  I know some true newbies who aren't intimidated.  I seen some who
flat out are POS idiots who spam the zone because no one will help them.
Beggars are not limited to experienced players because remember, some of
these people are also some who come from RPG backgrounds, ones who have
played the desktop or computer versions of D&D or similar games.  You seem
to ignore this fact, and believe it is purely an EQ Experience.

Actually, the reason I did not beg was cause someone told me to...  A
person who was my friend who introduced me to the game.  Furthermore, when
I made MY alts, as an EXPERIENCED player, I didn't beg people, nor bug them
for higher level things.  I inquired about the items, but never bothered
them for it.  I have seen other players who were new do it, not just
experienced players with alts.  In fact, I know several experienced players
with alts who flat out don't try because they know how much of a hassle it
is.

Easily doable quests versus quests that are long and tedious to the point
people cannot do them in a fair state of mind.  Hmmm...  Let me share
something with you.  I have heard a fair amount of bitching from people
towards verant for how things are with some of the items.  Hell, I am
trying to get my own Kromriff Military Leggings for my druid.  The problem
is, I can't.  Why?  I need to harness the Broodmother.  But I can't... Why?
Because she spawns once every 12 hours and requires Fergul to be up for it
to work.  Why is that a problem?  Well, I can't sit there for 12 hours
waiting to see her pop, then try to harness her without support of friends,
cause I sure as hell don't want to go through CC again to try and get the
Acid or the sceptre to get the control gem and going around kiting drakkel
wolves to get their blood wolf to spawn to get the damn harness to make the
control harness to wait again for the broodmother and fergul to get back
up.

So this is where...  People do like the idea of getting rid of no-drops...
Some of us are not friggin die hard, spend every waking hour of our lives
playing Everquest.  Why do you think some of the Ebayer assholes seem to
pop up.  They do want to play with some ease in things, at a different
expense.  Personally, some of the no-drop things, just to go through the
hell of hunting down the snow griffin to make that stupid snow griffin
soufle, other people can do without.  And let's not get started on the
issues of trying to get tradeskills up to do some of the quests.  There are
a bunch of people who are a bit annoyed to work up their trade skills,
especially tailoring, to a level to do some of the quests to get the nice
items.

At the end of the day, some people do want to spend the money instead of
the hassle for some items.  The real issue is...  Should some of the good
items be put on a way lower level to make them breeze through like every
hit was a pin-prick?  No.
