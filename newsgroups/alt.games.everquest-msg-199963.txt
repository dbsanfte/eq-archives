I posted this question several months back and this is the answer i
received.  The Dark Masters Chant for 1-3 hours ever 3 days.  You must kill
the Dark Masters within 15 minutes of the first one being slain.  I have
heard of people being able to spawn him more then once in a day but because
of the quick respawn of the the DA's, our guild never was able to.
