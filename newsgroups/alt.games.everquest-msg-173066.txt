There is also the constant problem of perception.  If enough
people tell you the game  is no fun at lower levels then that is
what you expect and that is, then, what you get.  However, to me
the game is fun from the instant I hit the ENTER WORLD button
with a newly created character.  In fact, I have stopped playing
my main altogether because I don't want to devote the time
required to play him -- staying up all night to go raiding --
waiting for two hours to get in a group at the camp where an item
I want drops -- and all that.  To me it's more fun to go try a
different race or different class.  It's my opinion that there
are so many uberplayers /shouting their opinions that the rest of
the players get drowned out.

There is plenty of fun to be had at level one -- if you will just
stop worrying about what happens at level 30, 40, 50, and above.
