What race did you start and were are you hunting?  All you had to do was ask
people here on the board for advice and they would have told you where you
should go and what to hunt.  Really though, the first 20 levels for the most
part are the easiest to level and you don't need to be level 10+ to group,
just make since that usually you level quicker from 1 to 10 solo if you know
where to go.
