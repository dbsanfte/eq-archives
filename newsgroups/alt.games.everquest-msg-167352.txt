*DING*  We have a winner!  I had to make a run to an optical shop
today because when I tried to replace the nosepiece on my son's
glasses the stupid ultra-miniaturized screw was effectively
invisible to me (much smaller than the screws in my glasses, very
irritating) and it proceeded to bounce once and vaporize when
my fingers slipped the tiniest bit on the screwdriver.
