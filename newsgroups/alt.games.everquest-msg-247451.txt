Uh, Bet not. To sell Sony will either have to, 
a) Totally devalue the market by undercutting PlayerAuctions to the
point that far-east farming labour & macrobots are economically
unviable (i.e, damn near free), or 
b) Sell no drop items and items otherwise unobtainable.

Which do you think they'll do?

Theres a BIG difference between Sony doing it and playerauctions.

Playerauctions only have access to a miniscule subset of gear. The
only possible upside I can see is that if Sony start to view it as
part of *their* revenue stream they'll be hardcore about shutting down
'unauthorised vendors'.
