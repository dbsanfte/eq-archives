I think my druid at 30 has used the self port to DL once since i got it,
it was the most nerve wracking scarey run i have ever done through a
zone, and have taken the boat to FV any other time.  I don't even like
running through with my 41 rogue.  Actually most times I go to Kunark i
prefer to go through OT even though any character i have taken is KOS to
the Outpost.  I just think the boat ride is shorter than the one to FV,
and I rarely need to bank while there, can sell to the iksar in the
mudpits, etc.
