    Naw.  I've spent oodles of time in Lfay.  It's pretty
safe if you just stick to the zone walls, and of course,
avoid getting lost.  I have been brutally slain by that
horrible corrupted horse from time to time, but the brownies
scouts haven't gotten me  pretty much since the first day
that I found out what nasty little works of business they
are.
  Maybe I'll kill a Bandit sister or two just for old
times.
