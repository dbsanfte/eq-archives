Well one thing I always did/do with a mage.
Cast the pet, nuke with most damaging nuke once, maybe twice, then step in
and take some damage while the pet finish up the mob. While I am doing this
I cast a low level, low mana, low damage spell. (This still does more than
my melee most of the time).
Using this I have been able to take whites up into the 40's. (Usually chain
cast pets as needed if I am in trouble)

One thing others have noted, if you are playing a human to role play one
great. If you are playing a human because you like the starting location,
well the other races have more int and can usually get to the human starting
cities easily.
