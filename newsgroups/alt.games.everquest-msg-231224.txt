Actually, they left after Luclin's release, I believe. Maybe shortly
before. Either way, they were a big part of Luclin's development.

Wow, way to exaggerate things. But, given your previous comparison to
drug dealers, I'm not surprised by it. By your logic, running
McDonalds ads on TV every hour is unethical...

The game's been highly active longer than most others. It's only
natural that they'd keep cranking out new content as long as the game
remains popular. The only reason the expansion thing has been "taken
to a new level" is because it's stayed so strong for so long.

So, what the fuck are you still doing here if you don't play anymore?

The same can be said for any number of industries. (No, I'm not
talking tobacco, alcohol, etc)

Oh, gee, I guess comparing any food manufacturers to drug dealers is
just as legitimate, then. You're being absurd.

Making money=profit. If the money that comes in doesn't cover
expenses, they haven't "made money".

Why's it getting dirty? Are you a Republican? <sarcastic mocking> Oh,
sorry, that's getting dirty</sarcastic mocking> All that wisecrack did
was prove you're a closed-minded moron.

Tons out there. Don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out.
Honestly, I find EQ is still fun. Why the hell would I need to leave
it for a new game as long as this one continues to entertain me?

Well, damn, I guess the TV networks need to stop producing new shows.
And all those bands need to stop putting out new songs. Diminishing
returns. After so many decades, it must not be worthwhile to keep
adding new "content" to our entertainment... News flash, sparky:
Diminishing returns isn't a universal law.
