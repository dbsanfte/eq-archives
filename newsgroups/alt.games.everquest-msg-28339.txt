Hmmm.  It's like you didn't read my initial post at all.

All "/who all count xxx" does is give you a snapshot of who is online AT
THAT MOMENT.  At different moments in time, a different set of people will
be online.

With me so far? Nothing that shouldn't be obvious there.

My contention, based on my experiences and knowledge of the dynamics of the
game, is that the people in the 50-60 range are far more likely to be online
for long stretches of time.  Makes sense, right?  How else would you get
into that range? Plus the fact that a number of those characters are
guild-shared and thus almost always online (see Kang's own post for a
reference to wondering who leveled on of his clerics).

And the people in the 20-30 range, for example, are likely to be playing for
shorter periods.  Still following?

So given those two assumptions (well founded, I believe), it's easy to see
how a snapshot count could be misleading.

Yes, there are 600 50-60 online at the moment, and only 150 20-30.  But
those same 600 50-60 will be online for long periods, while there's a
regular turnover in the 20-30.  Because, remember, 50-60 online long,  20-30
online short.

Let's say 50-60 are on for 8 hour stretches, and 20-30 for 4 hour stretches.
Is that a somehow unreasonable assumption?  That would mean in any given 24
hour stretch, we'd have a total set of 900 20-30 players and 1800 50-60
players (I'm sure you cna veryify this with your own calculations).
Suddenly the proportions arent what they were, are they?  And if you do this
and add up all the level ranges, you'll see that it's likely  that the 50-60
range is actually a fairly small proportion of all players on the server.

So it really is simple.  A large proportion of high end players online at
any given moment does NOT mean that that's the overall proportion of players
overall.

My theory rests on the assumption that high end players play longer.  Yours
is based on the assumption that all level players play for equal amounts of
time.  You tell me which is more likely?

And yes, it's all theory.  We have no tools to answer the real question.
Only a method to sample and infer.  Give me 10 minutes with a SQL client and
access to the EQ database server and I'll answer all sorts of questions.
Give me /who all count and all we can do is guess.
