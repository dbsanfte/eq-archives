Nah.  Just the type of people that would do thing to mess with anonymous
minds.  Things like.:

Push your car into a gas station making sure the attendant sees you.
Fill your tires with air.
Get in and drive off.

While driving in your car, wait till the last possible moment and then
honk and wave to a car just passing you.  Or a pedestrian you are passing.
If you do it just right, they have just enough time to wave back out of reflex,
then you're past them and gone.  Sit back and know that the person you just
did that to will spend some amount of time thinking, "Who was that? They
looked familiar."    And sometimes, that person will know someone with a
car just like yours.
-"Hey.  I saw you the other day by the mall."
-"Not me. haven't been there in weeks"
-It had to be you.  You waved at me, remember."
-etc
-etc
