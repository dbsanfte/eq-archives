How are those mobs being pulled?  If you have a shammy pulling with malo, 
that'd pretty much confirm the low-aggro view.  But if a pally is 
paci-stun pulling, it doesn't tell us much one way or another, does it?

I never had much problem tash/slow/crippling without getting aggro in PoT.  
You just wait two seconds and stand a bit further away. :)
