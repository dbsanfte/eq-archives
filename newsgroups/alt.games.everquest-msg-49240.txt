Whee, get to refute.

>Every review of DAoC  has been quite favorable. 

My review of DAoC says that it is the most boring fucking game ever made.

Granted I am not an english professor, so some of the subtleties of my own
statement may be lost on me, but that does not strike me as favorable.

Yes, quite shocking that the people who are beta-playing the game for free
would have a favorable opinion of it.

DAoC = exactly the same, except the assholes can affect your game in so
many more numerous and profound ways. Sad you don't realize this, but then
you have so clearly demonstrated your brain power to be inferior to toe
jam, that it isn't much of a surprise.

> Let's face it, PvP
>is a joke in EQ, even on the Zek servers

Same with DAoC, just for entirely different reasons.

>most quests are nothing more than NPC guided hack-n-slash,
>fuck-it-didn't-drop, wait, hack-n-slash some more. 

DAoC is far, FAR worse for this. Their quests are so simplistic that it is
a sick twisted joke. "Epic" quest in DAoC: Run to one place (half hour),
deliver note. Return to starting point (another half hour), deliver another
note. Go back to the first destination again (up to an hour and a half
now), deliver note. Kill a really feeble monster, take head back to first
npc (2 hours of running), get "epic" item. WHOOOHOOO!!!!!! Oh yea, "epic"
item is grey and on the verge of uselessness 5 levels later.

Plus, the DAoC quest system is fundamentally flawed. All quests can only be
done one time. That isn't so bad by itself, but taken in combination with 2
other things, and it becomes really, REALLY bad:
1) Items in DAoC wear out and eventually are outright destroyed
2) Quest items in DAoC are twice as good as an equivalent level
drop/tradeskill item.

So, that means that once you complete the very finite list of quests, and
get the items, once those items wear out, YOU CAN NEVER WEAR TOP END
EQUIPMENT EVER AGAIN!!!! The only way to get the good stuff again is to:
a) Find someone who is really, really, REALLY stupid and is willing to sell
you the quest item
b) Make a mule whose sole purpose in life is to level up and re-do all the
quests again so you can reverse-twink yourself with the drops. Downside:
all quests in DAoC are level based (can only complete them within a certain
level frame), so your "twink" will need to be roughly the same level as
your main in order to get the items.

Most games reward players for being around a long  time, DAoC has managed
to do the exact opposite. Unbeleivable stupidity that the Devs think this
is a workable system

>all of you, just the smart ones) in DAoC.

Let the guillotine chop off your head on the way out.
