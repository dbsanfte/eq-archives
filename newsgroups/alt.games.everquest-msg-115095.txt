There is a command to target by name.  I think it is, appropriately enough,
/target <name>.

So make a social key with the following.

/target <whatever your char name is>
/doability <whatever ability number has your LoH on it>

Then just move it to your hotkeys, and you're in business.

I don't play a Pally, so I'm only guessing that LoH is on your abilities
panel.  But I felt like taking a stab at it for you.  Give this a try.  I'll
bet it will work.
