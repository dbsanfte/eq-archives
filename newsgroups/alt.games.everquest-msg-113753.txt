I've learned to lament what the planet likes, as 90% of people have no
taste.  Of course, there's also the fact that I just plain don't like
soccer, and it's fun to egg on european types who somehow think it's
superior to real football.

for those of you who are mad that I'm poking fun at soccer, deal with it)
