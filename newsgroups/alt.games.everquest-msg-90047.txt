Your druid is only level 16 when you can start to Quad fight you will
see your exp start to move a lot faster.  Plus your druid will be able
to run from a fight quicker, get to another spot faster and stand up
and take damage better when trying to make the snare stick.

A 4 blue quad is worth more than one yellow.  Yet a necro can recover
quicker after a fight.
