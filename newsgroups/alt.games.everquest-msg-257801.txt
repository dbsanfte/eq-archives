I remember it doing that every once and a while. Usually after major 
mojo on the client end, for example: adding charms.

I don't know of another automated management tool out there myself... I 
use Allakhazam for most things I've played (SWG, FF) and I used magelo 
for Tyas, but did everything manually.

I do remember it had more than what seemed it's normal share of time 
when the server was down, but I can't give recent evidence.
