What kinds of channels can you connect to with EQIM?  Serverwide channels?
Guild channels, or just single-server player-made channels?  I tried
connecting to a serverwide channel but it wouldn't work, but I don't know if
I did it right.

I tried finding this info on the Sony site, but there isn't much there.
