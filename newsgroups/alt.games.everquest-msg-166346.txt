Simple answer: bazaar.

If you want the money, that's where it is. I can make more money there
turning shit in one night then you can in pretty much any zone. And
any real loot you are going to get has to be sold through the bazaar
to get anywhere near market value.

For straight killing plat, Rathe Mountains. Kick Hill Giant butt and
get like 1000pp for a couple of hours work while i kick my trader on,
go to sleep, and find 3500pp on me in the morning.

Undercutters that place shit up for below market value are my friend.
I love um like family.
