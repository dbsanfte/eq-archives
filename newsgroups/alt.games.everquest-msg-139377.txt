Ahhh...I bet I know what is happening.  Here are the five lines of my first
macro:

Command 1:  (blank)
Command 2:  (blank)
Command 3:  /time
Command 4:  /loc
Command 5:  /doability 1

I bet that when the client loads, it just checks the first command, sees it
is blank, and so puts the default (/duel) in.  (My first two lines are blank
because at one time I had commands there, but deleted them).  Guess I'll
just move my /time up to the first line, and that should fix this.
