Aye - but I strongly suspect an interview with the Gimp would include
language not suitable for any minors that may read the newsgroup... : )

Plus, I would have to track him down again, last time I caught him just in
time as he was trying to climb the Qeynos clocktower with a high powered
rifle strapped to his back. After I sat him down, he just kept repeating
"Cazel...Pet attack...Yes Master...Cazel...Pet attack...Yes Master" with a
rather disturbing nervous tic in his left eye socket.
