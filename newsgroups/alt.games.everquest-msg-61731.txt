Overall, my experience on E Marr has been good.  There is one level 60
shaman whose name I don't recall that I avoid like the plague.  I was in CoM
with a group, and got trained by this idiot several times.  We did petition
him, don't know if anything actually came of it in the end.  The icing on
the cake there was that I got 5 of the 6 drops that I need for the shaman
epic, he got none of them.  I did send him a tell when one he was looking
for dropped, and I didn't need it anymore.  He, unfortunately, got killed
making his way over, and by the time he got back, the corpse had decayed.
My whole group was sorely disappointed.  The only reason I sent him a tell
was to get him out of the zone ASAP.  LoIO is bad, if I do play there, I do
so with shout and OOC filtered out.  That is the only zone that I have been
in where I always have to do that.  GFay has never been a problem for me.

As for topposters, well let's just say that some of us do care, but not
enough to have a fit about it.
