It's not that big, if you're a good class.  After finally finding the bank
the first time it's not difficult to find again.  It's a shame the stupid
clockwork guides won't guide you there like they'll guide you pretty much
everywhere else.

Hell, it's not even a big town if you're a necro!  No zoning is required,
unlike Felwithe, Freeport or Qeynos (probably leaving other towns out).  Of
them all, assuming you're not clumsy Kelethin is probably THE most
convenient city.

But yeah, the ticking is annoying

I'm assuming you're not admitting to be a damned buff beggar, and simply
accidentally typed "with" instead of "without."
