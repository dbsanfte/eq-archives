Read this:

http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm

kite - (v.) (usually "kiting") To run around, deliberately training one or more
NPCs, killing them slowly with DoT spells or DD spells (which takes a little
better timing), while staying just out of their reach. e.g. "Dontcha just hate
when Bards are kiting, and they drag Lockjaw down on you?" cf. reverse kite.
