They are seldom used at high level, so dont expect lvl 60 chars to be loc
experts. The only time i use locs is when im dealing with people who dont
know the zone (usually newbies). I hate using locs.
About 50% of people suck when it comes to travelling, I dont know why. I
never have these sort of problems with my guild.
The time I remember is when I was hunting in bw, and everyone wanted to do a
"quick" bank run. I was a bard and they all had sow. I waited about 10 mins
at the zone to DL. I then waited another 10 mins at zone to FV. Another 15
mins waiting at the bank. By the time we got back to BW zone, it had been so
long all but 1 of the party had logged off... probably bored I guess. Pity
they didnt decide to log off earlier and save the rest of us a lot of time.
Round trip should have taken about 20 mins.
I wont even start with some of the stories of how ive been kept waiting to
do ports. These days I dont wait long for people. That makes me a very bad
and horrible person to some. Probably people who have had things done for
them all their life (ie kids)
