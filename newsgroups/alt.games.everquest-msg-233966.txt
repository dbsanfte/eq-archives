As others have stated "Root" won't work unless you're in a PvP
scenario...

However, Cancel Magic will as long as you're grouped together. 

Ranger buffs at lower levels tend to suck when compared to higer level
shammy/Cleric/Druid buffs...but on one occasion, I've had a lowbie do
something similar...

Lowbie A says "Buff me" in private tells...feeling like a nice guy, I
invite to a group and proceed to buff him with what I have available.
Once I blew about 3/4 of my mana bar, his response was "That's It?
D00d, you suxxor. I shoulda just gone to PoK for buffs"...

So I proceeded to remove the buffs I bestowed upon him...

Answer: Invite to group so you can "heal", "buff" etc...then start
spammng Cancel Magic and watch the fun begin. Chances are, he wouldn't
know to disband the group to prevent you from stripping his buffs
away, and by the time he figures that bit out, you'll be able to get
at least 2 or 3 casts off, more if he's previously engaged with
running for his life.
