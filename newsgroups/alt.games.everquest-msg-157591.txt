I have a question.  When killing a tough mob, I usually go with my close
friend, and I like to check up on him to make sure he isn't dying.  I don't
usually have time to look for him(depending on the mob) so I was wondering
if anyone knows how to make a hotkey to target someone.

I tried /hot /target name
but that just does something like who all the player..

thanks in advance=)
