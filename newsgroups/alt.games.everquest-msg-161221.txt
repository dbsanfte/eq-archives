Try City of Mist, lots of undead there and yet its outdoors (easy JBoot
refresh), this probably won't trivial out on you just yet,

But the zone I used most going 44 to 54 was Cobalt Scar.  Yes, druids and
wizards solo there and suck up the mobs... but really you are only killing one
at a time, and there's rarely a problem finding ONE, its 4 at a time thats
tricky.  They pop and stand patiently while you get ready for them.  If you are
non KOS, they will let you med quietly afk for hours if you happen to, its
downright peaceful 99% of the time.  Only problem is someone pulling bulthar,
seachest, or sirens over to where you are, since they are KOS to all, or Drakes
or Azureake hitting you with their AE while shooting for someone else.

You can also do the drakes if you are brave; they roam, and you have to figure
out a good "start" position to pull them from, but they move as slow as a snared
mob, so you can treat them like you used to do Spectres in Oasis (or Feerrot),
and fear them, then nuke to your heart's content.  I liked to combine nukes with
stuns, as the stuns keep the things from covering so much ground, and there's a
good chance when fear breaks that the mob will be stunned for part of the time
it takes you to reapply fear.  Watch out, though, they have a 500hp AE that
dispells your buffs, and they are not in the least afraid to use it (in fact,
they only don't use it when afraid!)... so be kind and watch your flight path,
or you'll end up having to do some apologizing and perhaps some rezzing.  On the
plus side, they are very very rarely hunted even during the busiest quadding
part of the day; only two up at a time, radically different run speed than the
other mobs, and quite nasty if you aren't fearing them or staying out of range.

The Haunted Sea  Chest is also fun, again there aren't four so they are quad
proof, one spawns in the shipwreck every 6 minutes like clockwork.  Early on,
I'd pull one, kill it, med to full and by then another would be up.  Later, I'd
pull one, then go do a wyvern or drake or two, and come back and chest again if
no birds were up.

All these mobs drop an assortment of vendor gems and armor quest gems, so its a
good money camp.  Plus the birds drop hides that sell well to people raising
tailoring skill, if you aren't working on that yourself.

I used my solo time the same way you do, play, then AFK while on my butt,
repeat.  But if you weren't afk, you could take up fishing, the cobalt cod are
also used by tailors and fetch a pretty penny themselves.
