Sorry, but this is not a case of asking you to "prove a negative".

You made a claim ("your high-tech horror show is rarely if ever
happening").  Presumably, you had evidence which supported your
claim or you would not have made it.  "Goddess" is asking you
to provide that evidence, or admit that you were just hazarding
a guess WITHOUT actual evidence.

(Ironically, if you *would* have to "prove a negative"
to support your claim, then you've just admitted that
your claim is unsupportable, and was made simply
as a statement of faith.  Are you sure you want to
stick your leg into that bear trap?)

"Prove Santa Claus does not exist" is a request to prove
a negative.

"Support your claim that Santa Claus is rarely, if ever,
the provider of Christmas presents" is not -- it can easily
be supported with Christmas-season retail shopping data,
surveys of people's gift-giving habits, tracing the
origins of random sample of received Christmas gifts,
etc.

So...  Where's your representative sample of actual
hacked EQ accounts, and what's the breakdown on what
percentage was obtained in which manner?

Or perhaps you could just admit that you were speaking
off-the-cuff based on what you *think* is the case,
without actual objective evidence.
