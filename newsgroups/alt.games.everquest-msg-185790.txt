One of the problems with it is just that the lfg tag ISN'T tied to the LFG
window..
If you only do a /lfg on you will NOT show up in the lfg window as LFG..
You must open LFG window and hit the LFG button there to show up in a
search.

I /bug'ed this hoping that a change might increase the usefulness of the
tool.
