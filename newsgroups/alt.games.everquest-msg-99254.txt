Here's the basic rundown of this patch *message*:
March 21st, 3:00 am
------------------------------
- Contact buffs disabled for bards
- Fixed a bug causing the "Soandso begins to cast a spell" message
- Fixed the bug with last hit message
- Added more info to the /hitsmode help
- Added another option to the /hitsmode command
- Changed it so hitsmode windows do NOT draw when in "normal" mode
- Fixed a bug that was giving bards an error message

Hello? McFly? Does *ANY* of this sound like the kind of thing that
normally inspires VI to shut down the fucking world for hours, only two
days after a patch and subsequent emergency patches?

I'm not saying that they are *not* doing the above things. I'm just
saying there's bigger fish to fry that got taken care of. These are just
the window dressing ones they threw on the message. In and of
themselves, these items would have been left to the next scheduled patch
day.

What did they change, enhance, de-bug, nerf? Hard to say yet. But it
occurs to me that (aside from screwing over the mages from their brief
focus item bounty) VI may have seen that they had dropped the challenge
bar a *bit* too far. I think the xp changes will still be there, but
might be toned down a bit.  I'll run some more lvl 19 dungeon activity
in Kurns tonight on Inny and see if the mega-xp festival has been cut
back a bit.
