For those advocating a Fungi for warriors not at the AC soft cap, I
still want to hear it... at what point did AC stop being God for
warriors?

The only argument I've heard that even had the *sound* of being valid
(until you look at it too closely, that is) is the "15 HP/tick means
less healing per hour" argument. However, stop and think... once you're
into your thirties, you're going to be grouping with clerics that either
have the totally rediculous CHeal, or at least a pretty damned big one.
They are going to cast it *roughly* when you get down to a certain
amount of health left, depending on the heal being used and the DPS of
the mob you are tanking.

By the time you are even in your mid twenties, the mobs you are fighting
are dishing out a hell of a lot more damage than 15HP every six seconds.
WAY more. By the time you've stood toe to toe with the mob long enough
to take a significant amount of damage, let's say three or four ticks go
by. Even ignoring the damage mitigation issue (which you really can't)
then with your Fungi you have 45 or 60 more HP than a tank without one.
(out of what? Nearly 2K HP by that point?) The healers casts a heal at
whatever point. Almost always, particularly with CHeal, that heal is
going to be overkill. It's going to top you off or take you damned near
to it.  The heal spell doesn't have some magic intelligence to stop and
say, "Whoa! Hold on! This ubah bastage has a fungi!! I better use a
little less mana and heal him for less HP or it would be a waste."

Nope. You get the same heal every which way.

Now, add into that the fact that the person with better damage
mitigation will have been taking less damage than the person with less
AC. Even the slight edge in hit points that our Fungi wearer enjoyed is
nibbled away by the fact that the Fungi Wearer is getting hit harder and
more often.

Nope... nope... I just don't see it.
