No reason to have pet and shielding permanently memmed, and siphon str is
crap (level 1 btw)
My loadout at 16 is

1) FD normally, but swapped out to rebuff deadeye, shielding and spirit
armor (and resist disease where I'm currently hunting)
2) Dark Pact, you'll have to cast it often enough to justify a permanent
slot for it, mana regen is good
3) Lifedraw (the level 12 lifetap)
4) Clinging Darkness, snare is good
5) Leech (the level 12 lifedot)
6) Heat Blood
7) Heart Flutter (level 12 dot + debuff, makes them melee a little weaker)
8) level 16 pet when petless, Focus Death (level 12 luclin pet buff) when
pet is out.

Lose siphon str and start casting Dark Pact to utilize the leech more,
possibly stack a couple dots, particularly Heart Flutter for the str/ac
debuff.

Definitely keep shielding line up at all times, extra hp and ac is very
nice, and the MR doesn't hurt, I keep deadeye up also, but I'm a blind
erudite. Shieldskin is good if you know you're going to take a little
damage, like breaking a camp or something, but the reagent cost is a little
prohibitive for normal use, still a good idea to keep a stack or two of cat
eyes on you, it's essentially a self only rune spell.

Don't leech more than one, the regen effect won't stack on you, and it can
cause more agro on you.  If anything, when grouped I usually spirit armor
everybody, keep the pet doing damage, darkness if we don't have a
druid/ranger for snare, and mostly lifetap for damage, since a group is
going to kill too fast for full dot efficiency, as well as have dark empathy
up for emergency heals and to keep me low enough on health that lifetaps
aren't wasting the hp they give me.  As well as keeping Dark Pact on me at
all times for the mana regen.

My necro's been soloing at the Hollowshade zone in Paludal Caverns since 12,
I did the beetles to 16, but they're greening out now, and I'm a bit farther
in on the fungus fiends, which are significantly harder, I hear you can go
all the way to 25 fairly easily in Paludal.  I'll probably move over to
Unrest at some point soon.
