But he will still not get away with it if you /report'ed and /petitioned
properly he will be punished.
Whether he gets banned on first offense or not i don't know the specific
policy but if he is a repeat offender or will become one
be sure VI has their previous names on file for just such a thing. So i am
pretty sure he will not "get away" with it just by paying 50 bucks.

As for us mortals recognising him, well that's a different matter. But i
seems to recall someone mentioning a public database might be set up for
checking previous names on.
