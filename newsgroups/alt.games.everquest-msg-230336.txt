Jazz,

You might want to pick up a Soulstripper:

Camping the Enraged Soulstealer (he's a medium tough level 50 mob,
your L61 duo would be more than adequate) could take anywhere from
30 minutes to several hours, but the Druid I played on Stromm server
over the summer absolutely loved that weapon.  The proc doesn't work
until L40, but even doing just LDoN in pickup groups you will level
very rapidly to 40.  Also, while you're in Dulak you could park the
Cleric nearby and get him the drops for the Temperance quest:

if you didn't mind killing green/baby-blue mobs with your L61s.
