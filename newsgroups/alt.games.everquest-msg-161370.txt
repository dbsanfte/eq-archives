1. Ok, I can see your point about the HTML thing. That makes sense that some
readers might not read HTML or whatever.
2. Again, I see your point. Not everyone has broadband.

3.Ummm... Outlook Express doesn't seem to show me any FAQ anywhere, I don't
know what you are talking about. And what the hell is a top-post?

Some of you people need to lay off the Jolt-and-cappuccino smoothies with
the Ephedrine chasers. CALM DOWN. I asked a simple question, but some of you
FREAK out as if we were discussing the merits of cloning humans or
something. Simple question needed a simple answer, which Remington Stone
gave pretty well. Thanks Remington. =)
