Yeah, it's a very rare drop.  Our last Hate raid we brought a guest
with us to see if we could get a drop for her - 5 days of clearing
revenants yielded zero essences.  (On the plus side, we got drops to
complete a ranger & mage epic, so was a good run in all :-)

Anyway, I know essences are still dropping.  Another guild there at the
same time as us had one drop - but (and this will make you sick) it was
accidentally looted by a paladin who didn't what it was for.  Ouch.
And yes, they do drop from female revenants.
