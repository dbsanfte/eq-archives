http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/g/Godwin_s_Law.html

"Godwin's Law     prov.     [Usenet] "As a Usenet discussion grows
longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler
approaches one." There is a tradition in many groups that, once this
occurs, that thread is over, and whoever mentioned the Nazis has
automatically lost whatever argument was in progress. Godwin's Law
thus practically guarantees the existence of an upper bound on thread
length in those groups. However there is also a widely- recognized
codicil that any intentional triggering of Godwin's Law in order to
invoke its thread-ending effects will be unsuccessful"


It sounds more to me like it is mentioning the nazi's, or hitler, at
all in any kind of comparison in a thread which really wan't about
nazi's or hitler.
