At one point I couldn't get the exit phrase to work either.  So I *accidently*
targeted the exit NPC while still killing the mob.  I hit her 3 times before
she sent me out.  And *that* was wierd because she hit me back and still sent
me!
We won't be going back until they do something to make it more...
interesting... and doable.
