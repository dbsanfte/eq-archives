I've thought Wizard/Enchanter might be very interesting.  As a Wizard, I
have some rain spells that are very mana-efficient on a single mob, *if* the
mob can be stopped from moving out from under the spell.  For example, I've
got a level 52 spell that does 3 waves of 600 points damage, for 380 mana.
If all waves hit the mob, that is 1800 damage for 380 mana.  That's as good
or better than many DOTs.

However, the waves are far enough apart that a snared mob will only be hit
by one.  I can root the mob first, but each wave has a chance of breaking
root.

Now, add an Enchanter.  I could snare the mob.  One of us could root it.
Then I could cast the rain spell, and as soon as the first wave hits, the
Enchanter could stun the mob.  That would give me time to cast root again if
the first wave breaks it.  Same for the second wave.

I think this could be a fun combination.
