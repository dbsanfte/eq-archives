My vote is for Shaman because that's what I play and I know they are a very
good soloing class and highly desirable in groups as well, especially in the
new POP zones where slowing is very important.  I think the other two best
soloing plus grouping classes would be Beastlord and Bard.  Druids are a
good class, but there is an abundance of them so sometimes it can be hard to
find a group for a Druid.  Necromancers have a lot to offer a group, but a
lot of people don't really understand that, so it can be hard for a Necro to
get into a group.
