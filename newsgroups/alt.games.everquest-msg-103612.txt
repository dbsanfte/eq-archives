Hmm, I found a merchant in SfG selling this druid spell. I was surprised to
see a lvl 18 spell. I have done a search for information on it and (ok,
obviously I hadn't read the news out of Verant, sorry about that) and found
a reference to it having been changed from lvl 14 to lvl 18 a couple of days
after it was introduced but I have given up searching for information on
what it does (ok, sue me, I'm lazy) can you help (not with the laziness
aspect, there's no cure for that, but with what the spell does)?
