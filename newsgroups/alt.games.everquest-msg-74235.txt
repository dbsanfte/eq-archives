Hmmm....something odd is going on.  This should only help on WinMe
when you have a lot of RAM *AND* you are not doing things that cause
the system to run out of RAM.  SoL tends to want all the RAM, so SoL
will cause everything else to be swapped out.  Without the above
tweak, much of the other things would already be swapped out.  With
the above tweak, there should be less already swapped out when SoL
starts, meaning there should be *more* paging activity at the start of
SoL.  That tweak must be affecting something else besides just the
decision about when to start using the paging file on WinMe.
