True.  When I got my JBoots (mid-40's, Paladin) I was hanging
around S.Ro killing spiders for silks and hoping to get lucky
on the AC.

I saw the AC over a few dunes, and ran towards it, but at
least two groups had already jumped on it.  So I sighed and
went back to spider-hunting.

Not more than FIVE MINUTES later, I'm by the western derv
camp, when ANOTHER AC pops right in front of me.  I not only
killed it, but for some reason nobody else even showed up
to check it out or try to KS it.

When it's your time, it's your time.
