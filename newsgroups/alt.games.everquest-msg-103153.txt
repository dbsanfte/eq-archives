  The problem is that a shadow knight isn't just standing there letting the
mana flow back in.  They're in melee, they're spellcasting, and quite often
they're pulling with few med breaks.  85 mana for a level 15 hybrid spell is
just silly... even a pet at this level doesn't require that much mana to
cast.  Put this spell up against Siphon Strength and it just looks silly...
Siphon Strength gives you strength, which translates directly into ATK, plus
strength, which helps with encumberance.  Scream of Hate is 1700% more mana
to cast an inferior spell.  Sure, they can stack (I think) so it's not
either-or, but I don't have 85 mana to spend on 8 ATK points... which isn't
what I think I'm most lacking as a SK... I'm a lot more worried about my AC,
HP and mana.  I'm a tank, dishing out marginally more damage isn't as
important as being able to take a hit, or cast a clutch spell.

  I think all of the new Luclin SK spells were put in without any sort of
serious review.  Scream of Pain (level 30, 6 point AC tap) is pretty bad
too, though not as bad as Scream of Pain.  It costs 100 mana... a lot, but
at least it's AC, something I can use.  I'm waiting for level 39 when I get
Shadow Vortex, which taps twice as much AC for less than half the mana (40).

  To more or less ensure these spells aren't used by any PCs, they appear to
only be sold by a semi-hidden Luclin merchant.  It isn't worth the trip.
