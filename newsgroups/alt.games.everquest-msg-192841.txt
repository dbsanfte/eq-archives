Problem with letting them both beat on the MT for a while is that once the
first heal lands, the ad will go for the cleric, since the MT isnt taunting
or damaging the add.
Maybe tash it immediately and run, root when you have enough distance(since
it casts fast) or someone else snares/roots, then mez.
I definitly wouldnt be attempting an untashed mez as you did. Whatever
happens tho, always run it around in preference to dying, unless you risk
training more to the camp.
It might just be easier on all if someone else can root the add.
