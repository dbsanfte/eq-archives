True.  But a 59 Druid also deals far more punishment than a 56
Paladin.  Surely you aren't going to suggest that a 59 Druid is
inferior in solo play to a 56 Paladin?  It really isn't so.  My
51 Druid is a stronger soloer, even in dungeons, than my Paladin
was at 56.

I agree it's always good to start out cautious, and yes the trains
are rare and small unless a group is deliberately pulling them for
more efficient killing.
