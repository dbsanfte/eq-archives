It's leather and not *that* much better than the elysian tunic, so the
drooling monks and beastlords (yes, we have one. He'll have his epic
real soon, too) can have it as far as I am concerned. 

(Fixated on appearances? Moi?)

I looked up Rumblecrush's drops today and if there's anything from him
I'd want, it's that shield - of course, we'd have to get our clerics
one each first :)
I think I am going to be camping Lodi in the near future. If I get
lucky, I'll pass down my SBS to a guildie, grab a crystalline eye for
resists, and then use the Lodi shield as a shield for regular hunting
and as a back item for raids until I get another SBS (I like chardok)
or other shield.
We killed Lodi last night (and Sev and Talendor) and got a shield for
the camping shaman as well as 2 rings, so lots of EB gear :)

Um, since when does NoS have resists?

Yeah, those shields are nice. I'm starting to look forward to the day
we start doing stuff in NToV. As a wood elf, AGI is one of those
things I have never had to worry about, but I guess you should avoid
stuff like the shields of the X dragon.
