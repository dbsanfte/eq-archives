And another key point that is missed all the time...... in no dictionary
except SoE's and the "ubertude" dictionary can I find a definition of MMORPG
to mean you must group.  MM = massively multi-player, multi-player doesn't
mean group it means what it says multi (many) players...

I thank SoE for the new xp boost, now when I 2 box I can really make out
soloing with my Rogue while the cleric is in the trailer being dragged
around in auto follow mode.....
