Just like being black, for instance? I seem to remember something about that
a few decades ago - but some Americans seem to be prone to forgetfulness.
Too much television watching?

It used to be called civil rights, you might know.

In my country at least - that I regard as civilized -  NO business can offer
a service to the general public and then refuse it to a specific person
unless there is a clear and defensible reason for it. It's ironic that we
learned it, in part just from Americans...

Probably there is a reason why Mr. Bush was elected, however. And if his
friend Mr. Berlusconi has it his way, Italy might follow suite too.

But I don't think he will. He shan't survive the next general election.
