From what I understand, all mana recovery is equal no matter what horse (It
just gives you your Meditation bonus as you're sitting)

The 9k horses are slow (slower than SoW) and the 100k horses are fast.
(quite a bit faster than SoW)  Same goes for the Drogmors.

Horses are pretty but you see their heads, Drogmors are ugly, but no head in
the road to obstruct your targetting view.
