Hello again,

After reading several of the posts is has become painfully clear that I have 
made several mistakes that I take full responsibility for.  Although I read 
this news group two to three times a week, I have rarely posted.  When I 
have posted, it was always a 'new' post, and never a reply to an existing 
one.  I did not know what 'top posting'  was.  I do know now, which is why I 
sent the "Testing" message to see if I would raise someones ire to make sure 
my assumption was correct.  I did. I'm truly sorry and it won't happen again 
and thank you for bringing it to my attention.

I have also noticed that, through my own fault, I have eroded my own 
credibility.  I reply to posts like a whiny child who has had his lollipop 
ripped from his hand.  No one wants to listen to the rantings of someone who 
only attacks and never has a valid or an alternative point.  I plan to 
remedy that.

I hope this apology is accepted in the spirit in which it is given.  Thank 
you for tolerating my ignorance and shortsightedness.

As for the game, I plan on three or four posts to explain why 'lag' to the 
degree it is in EQ II is a sign of poor planning.  What 'beta' really means 
from a programmer (me) with 20 plus years expreience and why what Sony is 
doing is so very dangerous and will ruin a project.  I will explain a melee 
class, and how Sony has said one thing but it just doesn't seem to be 
working out that way. Perhaps some explanation of 'artisan' and what Sony is 
presenting to the public, and what is real are two different things.

Lastly, I don't want anyone to misunderstand me in reference to EQ II.  At 
my house, we have looked forward to this for over a year.  Things that were 
presented to us from Sony made us all excited.  Even when we first started 
playing I was thrilled and had great fun.  It was so wonderful.  I even 
bought the domain 'baubbleshire.com'  because I was going to put up this 
wonderful web site with a real halfling feel.  You can check, I have it a 
godaddy.com.  However, as the days wore on, and then the move to Anotonica, 
well, lets just say it made us all very sad at what we were seeing in game, 
as well as how the develeopers, as well as Sony handled their 'beta' 
testers.

Thanx for listening, I hope we can have some lively discussion!

Dick...
