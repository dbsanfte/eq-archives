Yes, that marginalization is why I chose a Half Elf, but...

/HighlyOpinionatedRant ON

*sigh*
(1) The "cultural" difference between a Human Necromancer follower of
Innorruk (sp?) and a Human Paladin follower of Mithanial Marr is orders
of magnitude greater than the "cultural" difference between that same
Paladin and a Half-Elf Paladin of Mithanial Marr.  If it's racial
tradeskilling then call it *^%$^*%$*^ racial tradeskilling.
(2) The pathetic sop they tossed at Half-Elves, letting them wear damned
near any racial armor is utter baloney and makes no %$@$@^*%$ sense in
the context of the game.  It has always annoyed me that High Elves could
wear "small" armor and Half-Elves could not though they are smaller
(please tell me how it is that the same steel plate armor fits a Gnome,
a Dwarf, and a High Elf???).  But, that's the way the "laws of physics"
worked in the minds of EQ designers, so that's the way it went.  Now
they want me to believe that Brellium Plate (Dwarven "cultural") will
fit shorties and Half-ELves, but not Elves???.  Make up your *&^$^*%$*^
minds morons!  What they did was to make the d00ds happy by aranging
for them to be able to make pretty twinks, while anybody who played a
Half-Elven tradeskiller for two years and gets got told "tough shit,
we'd rather reward the people who will now create 5000 mules, who gives
a damn if it further erodes the immersive quality of the game".


<snip attempt at reasoned discussion>


The backstory's a load of mismatched and poorly thought out crap,
so filled with spelling, grammatical, and logical errors that it
obviously has the absolute bottom priority on the development
team's list.  But that doesn't stop them from trying to use it
to justify stupid decisions (like calling racial tradeskills
cultural), nor does it stop various players from parrotting the
party line without giving a moment to consider just how flawed
the whole *^%$^%$ mess is.

The game reserves its "greatest" rewards for those who care least
about the roleplay environment.  This has been true to some degree
from the beginning, and has been made more and more true with every
substantial patch and every new expansion.

/HighlyOpinionatedRant OFF

None of the above should be construed as indicating that I have a
poor opinion of EQ overall.  It's a great game, I play (too much)
because I (usually) have a lot of fun playing.  I cannot imagine
having such strong opinions about these matters if I didn't like
the game so much (for instance, I really don't give a damn about
the things I think are stupid in DAoC, I don't play DAoC).


Kaev <--- hopes he's finally done ranting on this topic
