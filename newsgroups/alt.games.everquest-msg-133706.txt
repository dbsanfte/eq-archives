Now, I don't know about the level difference, but I have definitely groped
with women who have had far less experience than myself. Even with the lack
of experience, I was able to grope her, and she me. Not sure what your
problem may be. Maybe your trying to apply that 2/3 rule, and are groping
the wrong 2/3 of the body?
