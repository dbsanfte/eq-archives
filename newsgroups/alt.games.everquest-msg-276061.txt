I have a friend who lives in England.  When he bought EQ, he ended up with 
the New Dawn version.  This has given him trouble with auto-buying 
expansions but so far we've been able to get around that by buying it for  
him and sending him the key code.  Until Dragons.  After working all day to 
figure out why he couldn't get in the guild hall, I finally had him send me 
a screenie of his patcher and it's different from mine.  It doesn't have a 
check box for Dragons at all.  So he can't get the files to update and he 
can't get in the new zones.

I think if I send him a patcher file that it'll fix it for him.  I just 
need to know what file he needs.  Can someone help me out with filenames 
please?
