That's apparently just gotten a good test on my server.  Two guilds, 
Deathrow and Final Destiny, were racing to the undead bard in Trak's lair.  
DR got there first, triggered the mob, then held it a bay somehow while 
they shouted throughout the zone and bazaar channel etc for more.  After 
about 90 minutes of that, FD got bored and killed it and spawned Trak in 
under two minutes.  Rumor has it the triggering bard doesn't lose anything 
in the triggering process.

So what's your call?  Evil or silly?
