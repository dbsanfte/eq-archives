I have a cleric that's 27th now and I stoped playing him for that reason .As
a cleric your job is to sit in a corner and watch heath bars, WooHoo!
Not to mention hardly ever getting loot and having to do symbols for
everybody ,which as we all know isn't cheap.
And don't you love those groups that expect you to keep them alive no matter
how retardedly they act .But if you die they hardly notice. Not a "hey Lomax
sorry bout' that couldn't keep them off you." or anything.

 Although I'd have to say the big benefit in being a cleric is you can
almost always get a group.
