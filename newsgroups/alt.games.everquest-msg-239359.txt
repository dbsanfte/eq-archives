Another case is when you know whether you are standing or sitting, but that
changes between the time your brain makes the decision to hit ctrl-s, and
your fingers actually carry out the command.

Example: you are sitting medding.  A mob runs over to attack you, so you hit
ctrl-s to stand.  However, just before you actually press the keys, the mob
hits you, causing you to automatically stand, and turning your ctrl-s into a
sit command.  So you hit ctrl-s again on the way down, but the mob swings
again, and that takes precedence, so that sends you up and your second
ctrl-s brings you back down.  You realize you've got a loop here, and back
off, giving the mob a free third hit to get you back up.
