I've gotta agree with Roger.  For most classes, who has aggro is irrelevent
soloing, because if you have one mob and one soloer you've got aggro on the
soloer.

Let's take an example from today's situations with LDON.  Bards are
currently considered *the* pulling class for most adventures.  But what if
your bard has charm or chant-kited up to 60?  More is better for a soloing
bard; does he have the timing down for a lull pull?  How many mobs does a
bard used to a high-speed kite know how to keep mezzed?  Even the pulling
song can get you in trouble; I used to pull with Brusco's bellow until the
first time I pulled a summoning mob... now I pull with Song of Dawn (Bard
Jolt).

I can make more examples - going back to wizards, a solo wizard has no need
to learn when to cast Concussion, or even to have it; a soloing ranger won't
know how to rootpark, or how to quickly build and shed aggro to get a mob
off a healer then pass it to a tank; as a solo enchanter I used to take care
of unwanted adds with a mezz and a Recurring Amnesia - use RA in a group and
the tanks will kill you only if the cleric doesn't get you first!
