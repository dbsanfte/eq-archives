I haven't checked, but its entirely possible that the stuff isn't no 
drop on the Firiona Vie server.  Precious little is.

Hmm, I wonder if there's a market for completed combines on the FV 
server.  I used this method to get tailoring and smithing up to 54 for 
my then baby and dead broke berserker, and found the outlandish number 
of trivial combines I had to make really annoying.  If I was wealthy and 
starting a trade skill, it would have been nice to be able to purchase 
the 80 or so per step I ended up having to combine at trivial levels. 
On the other hand, why buy finished combines when I could just as easily 
purchase the ingrediants to do other recipies where I also wouldn't have 
to do the trivial combines.

The NPC won't give you ingrediants until you have no more of the 
ingrediants you had -or- finished combines.  However, if you can drop 
finished combines on the ground (or hand them to a mule/confederate), it 
should be possible to manipulate him as suggested.

This depends on the skill.  Smithing can be raised fairly high just 
spending a little cash.  Tailoring, however, is just a pain unless you 
go blow the plat in the bazaar or something.

Most trade skills aren't limited by level, unlike combat skills.  There 
are a few exceptions, tinkering, and alchemy I think... but generally 
you can be a level one GM whatever if you like, and some do.

It is but an option, a handy one for some, but there are surely other 
ways, as people have found for 5 years before GoD release.
