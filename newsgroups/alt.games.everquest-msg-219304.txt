My experience has been the same, to the extent that after a tank and a 
Druid/Cleric healer I tend to look for 3 other DPS classes
when I am putting a group together.  People are generally surprised to be 
in a group with a Druid, Beastlord, Paladin, 2 Mages and a Necro but I 
think we completed a kill 59 in around 36 minutes.

We also found that we made more efficient time if the druid mainly
nuked instead of healed since the Paladin was chain stunning. You don't 
have to worry about adds if they're dead before they hit you :)
