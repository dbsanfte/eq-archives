Short answer? Yes.

He hit it first, his kill.
He crashed your camp... he's a dick... but still 'technically' within the
PnP.

Only way to deal with people like that is to let them die when they
over-pull... and then laugh at him when he comes back looking for his
corpse. Don't assist him, don't heal him, don't buff him... just /ooc to the
zone there's an EBayed trainmaker about.
