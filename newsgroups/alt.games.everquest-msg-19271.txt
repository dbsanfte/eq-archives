I play a level 14 SK, and have magic weapons, armour and about 80pp in the
bank. Everytning I learned about money making was from this news group.

Kill kodiaks, and collect high quality skins, I have found that the best way
to sell them is to go back to the bank (I pay in Freeport) and /auction if
anyone wants to buy them. They sell for about 20-30pp, Since I am not greedy
I generally ask for 20pp. This also has the advantage of ensuring a quick
sale. There's nothing stopping you /auction ing in other zones, but
personally, I have got a better response in town.

After you have sold a few you can spend your wealth on a magic weapon, and
go hunting wisps, that's what I did.
