In The Warrens I got my level 9 wizard taxi to 20 last weekend.  This past
week I got him to 25 in a different zone (I don't share my favorite PLing
zones publicly...I don't want to contribute to them getting crowded ;) ).
His /played is just shy of 2 days using a 51 druid as the power leveler.

Yeah, no skills to speak of beyond Evoc.  I had to spend some practice
points just so he could teleport. :)  I still can't get off the most recent
self-buffs without using half my mana in fizzles.

I suspect I'll be able to get him to 35 within another day /played.

Maybe if the guy said he could get him 10 levels in a couple days he meant
/played days?  Dunno.
