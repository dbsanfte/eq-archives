Get hurt to under 50% of your HP total, then use the skill on yourself.

Best way, find a friendly mage to summon you a couple backpacks full of the
things, then find a place where you can run down a hill taking damage or jump
off a small ledge with a quick way back up, ; this will work on your Safe Fall
skill while providing relatively controllable damage.  Then when you get down
to 5% HP or so, start binding till you hit 50%, then back to running circles on
your damage producer.

This should only be necessary once, getting your neglected skill up to its
current max.  After that, if you use it during play normally you should easily
get the extra 5 points of skill every level
