I wonder what Sony would do if the high level Trolls on some server took
back the city.  Say the trolls (and the Dark Elves, who want them out of
Neriak, and the Ogres, would might prefer having Trolls as neighbors)
invaded, and killed, and kept dead, the Froglok guards, merchants, bankers,
trainers, and quest NPCs?

On the one hand, I would guess Sony would be annoyed that this would disrupt
the zone for the newbie Frogloks.  On the other hand, it would be great role
playing, which I think Sony would like.
