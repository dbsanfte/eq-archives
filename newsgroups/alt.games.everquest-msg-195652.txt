<<<It's silly. If it's going to be such a part of the game environment, they 
just need to bump up everyone's mana regen rate. They don't though, 
because that would be a bad idea. If everyone regen'ing mana faster is a 
bad idea, then how is everyone running around with KEI not?

And as far as all of us "really talented guys" go, I don't claim to be 
all that talented, but I do aspire to be. I feel I have a much greater 
chance by not using training wheels.>>>

Unfortunately what all this comes down to is that you've made it to a higher
level than most,  and you want it to be at least as tough, if not impossible,
for others to make it as high as you and it bothers you that others are having
more fun and are catching up to you.  You're not going to be as "uber" when
more and more people are catching up to you because KEI makes it a faster and
easier.  Here's a suggestion, quit worrying about what everybody else is doing
and start focusing on your own game.  Have fun playing any way you want.  You
think game is too easy don't get KEI.  I'm enjoying myself a lot more with my
"training wheels" on.
