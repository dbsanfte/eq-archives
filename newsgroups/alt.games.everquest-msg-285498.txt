There were such addons, but most don't use them in raids - it's a good
way to have dead people and way too much overhealing.  The most commonly
used raid addon for healing AFAIK was "Emergency Monitor" - which 
displayed
the top most injured folks in a list, and you clicked them to target and
heal.  Even then, most healers in AQ40 and Naxx that I've talked to only
used it during trash clears - they said that riding the monitor was a good
way to wipe.

Not only can we still write addons to display that data - but that ability
has actually been enhanced in 2.0.  The new SPELLCAST_SENT event will 
allow a raid addon like CTRA to track not only the health of a unit, but
how soon (and how large) a heal is going to hit it.

Furthermore - they completely exposed the logic that allows spells to be
cast on units without having to change your target, as well as determine
if a given unit is within range of a given spell.  Cladhaire's old version
of Clique had to do some funky footwork to get the same effect, and it was
not 100%.  Now you can shade raid frames based soley on 
IsSpellInRange(spell, unit) and cast on them with either a macro of the
form /cast [target=unitcode] Holy Light, or with a secure action button
with its "unit" attribute set to that unit.

Really, looking past the lockdown on using logic to determine the spell or
target in combat (it can still be done OOC for buff addons), we are
gaining a HUGE amount in this patch - the SecureActionButton/
SecureStateHeader is just the slickest thing you've ever seen.
