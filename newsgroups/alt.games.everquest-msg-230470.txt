> Manasong.
If that is all a Bard was good for, I would have quit mine long ago.

> Other things, such as hasting and slowing are already accounted for 
In your late 40'/ early 50's your bard will recieve a haste song that
stacks with chanter, etc... haste and allow the haste cap to be
exceeded. So, NOT hasting is a no no.

>but in generaly, your job is as a mana battery).
I have been in 2 or 3 groups that thought this way. In all instances
"politely" disbanded pretty quickly. Bards can do quite a bit. Haste
(above cap), CC and back up CC, regen hp's (with a good lute, the hp
per tick is respectable), resists (what Dragon raid would be complete
with no Bard resists?), DS (though no where as good as a Druid /
Ranger). And so much more.

I think as your Bard gets a little higher you will see there is a
myriad of jobs to be done in any group. More than likely with your
other characters you havent noticed what bard have actually been doing
in your groups. Alot of folks dont.

An easy example would be my bard Bonam. In just about every LDON group
he has he is twisting a DS, Haste, and a damage absorption song
constantly (or some 3 or 4 song twist, depends on the group). Mana and
HP regens between pulls, pulls with lull and slow/snare, and is either
mezzing or back up mezzing. I keep busy ;)
