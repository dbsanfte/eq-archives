53, now. I traded Imbued Granite Spaulders for it and a lupine dagger
about 6 or 7 levels ago. I kind of regret trading now.

Ahh well ;)

A thread similar to this just started on the rangers glade -there is talk
there of level 1 ranger twinks in *full* Tolans (Kunark armour legs and
chest dropped from Venril Sathir and Trakanon respectively) with exsquisite
weapons and uber-haste to die for.

*cries*

Level 1's with gear that seriously outclasses me and my guildies who range
up to level 59.
