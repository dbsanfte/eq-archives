Have a new little bard on the FV server (which I'm really enjoying, bye the
way).  He just hit level 5, and I've been working on the Qeynos bard newbie
quest armor.  Since most everything on FV is droppable, I ran around to a
few vendors to see if, by chance, they had any of my rarer quest components
for sale.

So, I kick on Selo's, equip my drums, and I'm off towards the Barbarian
fishing village.  I zone into WK and run down the path, turning right at the
first guard tower.  About half way to the fishing village past the tower, on
the ground left of the path, something caught my eye.  It was a bag.  Not a
big bag, mind you, it was very small, the kind of bag that lies on the
ground when you drop fishing grubs or rabit meat.  Well, curiosity got the
best of me and I decide to pick it up.

YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED

I log back in and find myself at the Qeynos Hills zoneline.  "Hmmm.." I say
to myself, "Maybe it was bad timing.  Where's that bag?"

I run back to the bag.  I make sure I'm standing perfectly still so I won't
take off running linkdead.  I check my lag-o-meter which is at 0% and the
numbers are less than 150 on both sides.  I decide to pick up the bag.

YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED

/em scratches his head and looks *really* confused.

Anyone know what this was?  Were there a group of GM's standing there invis
laughing like madmen at the idiot that clicked on their little booby-trapped
bag twice? Bug in the game where you can't pick up foraged items anymore?
Any info you have would be appreciated.
