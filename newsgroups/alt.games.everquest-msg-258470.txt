As was mentioned in another thread...Uncle Al (Allakhazam) is your best
friend...

Take a look here... http://everquest.allakhazam.com  Also explore his links
section.  Much more information for your class...

As for where to find the weapons you will be shown by Uncle Al, if you have
access to the Bazaar on Luclin, that is where you will need to go.

I do hop that helps.
