I was thinking of upgrading soon (before SoL anyway heh) and was thinking of
a thunderbird 1.4Gig. My only problem is that I don't know what Motherboard
and, consequensive, what kind of RAM I should get. I'm a build-my-own person
so don't go for bundeled packs from dealers.

I currently have a intel 500 MHz with 384 ram. Ram is dirt cheap now so my
new system would probably have 2 512 dimms. But the problem here is what
kind of ram, DDR or SDR?

I'm keeping my video (Creative GF2 GTS32), network(10/100 Thrust) and
soundcard (SB Live!) plus monitor and other periferals, which all should be
sufficient for now.

Could anyone give me some suggestions for MoBo and Ram type/brand? Money is
not a real issue, but I'm not going for the ultimate top either :)

Many thanks in advance,
Kilmir
