A broad consensus means how many percent?  51%?  Does he stop being a god
when his consensus falls below the minimum?  So is godhood no more than an
arbitrary title?

I disagree.  Godhood should be a state of being that is supernatural above
all other beings.  That does not necessarily mean that there could be only
one.  But surely the gods should not be less powerful than a single dragon,
or 40 mortals.
