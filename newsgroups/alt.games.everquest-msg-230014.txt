    Some of those parts might still be above a level 49 with lower level
companions, but what you can do, do. The spell really is that good.

    Although it doesn't cure Malo, bad Monual. ;-) He meant to say Tash.

    When I want to annoy some of our guild warriors, I'll send them a tell
mid-CH: "Looks like you're going to one-tank this!" The funniest response
was the warrior who was so busy typing a nasty "don't say that!" tell back
that he ate Enrage and croaked.

    If the mob after you doesn't have ranged attacks, and you have five
seconds, there is another way. Use the GVD, then run for zone. Nothing along
the way will see you, and the mobs assisting the thing after you should be
far enough behind you that you don't get hit on the way out. But yeah, DB is
an always-up spell.

    I've always had sound on, and it's never been annoying since they
changed critter combat sounds to "only if you're hitting it". You should
turn it back on, there's some neat sounds in game. Like when Xegony casts
her AE, it sounds like a woman is speaking in tongues - very neat! Yes, I'll
do anything to make a Xegony fight bearable. Last one I turned on effects to
watch her light up with all the spells. Not a lot of lag with the new
effects, and the end of the fight when everyone starts nuking her was very
much like the end of a fireworks display. Highly recommended!
