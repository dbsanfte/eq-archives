In our early time days (first 3-4 months), TS rangers used to blow EVERYBODY
away on dps :)

It varied.. top 4 could be rogue, rogue, monk, ranger. or rogue, ranger,
rogue, monk.. or rogue, monk, rogue, ranger

Enough agro to totally lock the mob down, so that 3 heals later the cleric
doesnt' draw agro and get 1 rounded

Well im an officer, call it a perk of the job :D
My 2 trials didnt always have a ranger there.. just a way things were from
when we had more warrior/knights online. But rangers certainly could tank
them as well as me.

> You do know rangers actually lower their dps through casting?

With a 2hander, when its not resisted?
If thats the case, when when I talk to guildie rangers.. they talk about
their dps being a bit low that fight, because they were too lazy to nuke too
(wielding 1 handers)

Heals more, with a 6000x longer refresh time, and isn't targetable :D
Yes, theres been rare occasions where a ranger heal saved a tank, and
subsequently the raid

Man thats so far off base.
Stonewall (resisted spells not breaking FD) is a godsend, for sure. It
should of always been in regardless... resisted a spell, and it still breaks
FD?
But man, so many mobs cast malo, tash, or other unresistable AE's, and the
failure right on those is high.
As for FD, you bet it can fail!  FD fail rate is retarded, im all for
tougher pulls and higher chance of death, but the skill totally failing and
the message is sad.  When i fail 5 times in a row, and its happened plenty
of times, it makes me wonder wtf maxing it to the skill cap was for. If a
cleric fizzled spells 5 times in a row, including 1-3 more fizzles per hour,
even for just 1 day, i don't think they'd be impressed.

Also FD can be set zone by zone for a higher/lesser failure rate, as per
some quote many moons ago.  Yes FD is immensly powerful, but it by no means
makes you unkillable, and id be far happier with pulls successes based on
skill and approach, not on the RNG luck of the draw for an FD fail

Lull should just be taken out of the game

Would anybody but the main tank notice a difference if they didnt have
Symbol, Virtue, Focus etc?  Probably not.. but its a step to minimise risk
in raids.  Would the raid wipe if the dps groups werent with a bard?  Who
knows.. again its about efficiency and minimising risk.
ATK buffs boost dps, so what melee would turn them down?  We have SOP mgb'd,
i see people ask for CotR(not me, i have 10th dain ring), and all the top 10
dps typically ask for SoT on a regular basis.

In what scenarios wouldnt they have enough buff slots? I mean i raid the
same or higher mobs, requiring the same or more buffs, and i find a way to
juggle my buffs fairly well.

Our SK's parse far far below rangers on the parses i talked about last
fight.
