How do you define it as an exploit?  It's well known and well documented 
as a faction/minor item farming technique.  Is it only an exploit if 
you're using it on a named.  Is it only an exploit if you can't see the 
mob?  I would have to see a bit more clarification before I believe it's 
an exploit any more than /assist is.
