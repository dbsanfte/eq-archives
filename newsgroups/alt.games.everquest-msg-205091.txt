Excellent!  Ignore the point of the post to make a snide remark.
Ignore the annoying little detail that your post misses the mark
anyways (most of my fighting in LGuk was done in areas with room
to swing a big weapon, relatively open areas with high ceilings).
Congratulations!  You win absolutely nothing beyond the disrespect
of one or more anonymous usenet posters!  Carry on citizen!
