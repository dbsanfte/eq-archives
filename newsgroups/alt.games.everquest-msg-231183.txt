Just for shits and giggles, check out how pathetic dexterity is on
Ornate Ranger gear.  Some items have no dex all, one reason I
hesitated to get the gloves and sell the ones I have.  Several have 3
or 4 Dex.  Only a couple of them have meaningful dexterity on them, in
particular the greaves.

If interested, my gear is (mostly) shown on my next post.
