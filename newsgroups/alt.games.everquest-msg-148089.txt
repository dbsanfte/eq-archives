Hi.  I have a range of characters.  I certainly did not notice any sucking
at 30.  There are things that could effect your enjoyment.  For example- the
higher u get the harder it is to solo the not primarily solo charatcers.  Of
course with a 29 Rogue u must have noticed this already.  Certainly as you
get up there xp comes in slower.  All depenes what u want from the game.  My
Druid 51 is still doing fine as far as Xp goes.
