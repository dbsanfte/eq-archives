(from memory)
Fiery Avenger (the first particle weapon ever) final hand in is in Sky,
to a (spawned) Erudite Paladin named Inte Akera. He is on Deepwater
Knights faction (the paladin guild in Erudin). I imagine you need him
to like you quite a lot before he will give you a Fiery Avenger.

On a side note, being both an Erudite and a Paladin, he's *really*
snobbish about lesser races, classes, and alignments, so when you go to
do your FA hand in, make sure that everyone who isn't purer-than-pure
is *right over the other side of the island* before you have Inte
spawned :)
