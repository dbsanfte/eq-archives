RL.

I was playing (on Torvonnilous) almost 24/7, and it was killing me. Now I
play RL 24/7, and that's killing me too.

Go figure.

I think I've got 50 years left in me, give or take. I am stuck in
first-person and there's no tech support.  There is new content being added
every day, I know, but I always find myself doing the same quest over and
over... maybe it's just habit, or I'm just too lazy to change, but at least
I can use my tradeskill, and the plat isn't bad.

The one thing I really like about RL is that there is very little hunting,
at least in my part of the world. You don't gain any xp by killing, leveling
is simply a proportion of time, and that takes a lot of the pressure off.
As good as that sounds, of course there's a balance: if you die, you can't
get a rez. So far I haven't heard of anyone starting over. I've lost a few
friends along the way.

You do gain AA points by improving your tradeskills and by being better at
selling and trading than the other  uh... people. With the plat you
accumulate you of course buy rations (some of the merchants are great!), and
you buy better items, and, -get this-, your own building! You can hide your
things there, kind of like a bank, and log between quests when you get
tired.

Some of my neighbors even have their own little guilds. You can't join them,
you have to start your own.

Oh, and this was great...last night, I grouped with one of my neighbors and
we went to a tavern in Freep..  er..  well we had some ales and talked about
each others quests. It didn't cost me much and I had fun. I wore my leather
jacket and my denim leggings and my cowhide boots. We took -MY- car, and
yes, it cost me 9339, but at least it goes faster than I can run!

Well, even though I am dying, I know it's not going to be for another 50 or
60 years or so, and I can walk around just about anywhere I want knowing
that most everything is amiable. Kind of reminds me of the Plane of Growth.

RL is not so bad now that I think of it. Tomorrow I am going to fill a few
boxes with some of my old spell  uh... books and see what I can get for them
at the book merchant. Happy questing to you.
