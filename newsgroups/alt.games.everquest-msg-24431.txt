I don't have any specific advice on gear, but my 2cp worth on stats:

Enchanters may get beat on a lot, but except at very low levels you'll be so
far down the AC curve regardless of gear that it's not worth the effort.
Extra HP are nice, but fall mostly into the same situation as AC. As a pure
caster you are all about mana, everything else is secondary to that (except
probably CHA for an enchanter). At low-levels +mana items are better,
mid-levels +INT is better, and at high levels you want maxed INT (well, 200
as that's the soft cap) and as much +mana gear as possible without
sacrificing INT or CHA. You'll also need to be concerned about resists gear
at high-levels for raids and such.

INT makes a big difference to your mana pool, but it depends on your level
as to whether you should go for +INT or +mana. Mana for pure casters is
based on the formula (INT/5+2)*LEVEL, with the 'soft cap' on INT being 200
(after that, 1INT=1mana regardless of level). At L1  with 142 INT you'd have
30 mana, with 200 INT 42 mana. At L30 you'd have 912 or 1260, at L60 1824 or
2520. That may equate to only a few spells extra, but they can be vital and
will likely be a lot more use to you and your group than any extra AC or HP
you might be able to get.

Bottom line: Forget AC and HP unless you have maxed INT and CHA and have a
load of +mana gear too. Depending on how high you plan to get your chanter,
either buy a load of +mana and CHA gear, or get INT stuff instead of some of
the mana. AC and HP gear will only really help you sub level 20 (or lower).
