Ok , the main purpose of a cheal chain is to keep the tank always healed
(ie. not dead with everyone else dead right after). Mobs can only do so much
dammage in one round of combat. The idea is to overlap the cheals in such a
way that your tank cannot possibly die.

So with 2 good clerics an iffy cleric and a druid you might have all 4 in
the chain and each starts casting a cheal 4 seconds after the last started
casting. This will get the tank a cheal every 4 seconds against the uber
mob. It will be much cheaper than trying to do this with spammed quick heals
(it saves mana) .The amount of time before the next cleric starts varies
depending on the hideousness of the mob. (3k quadder with a 5k proc requires
a short time interval). As your lesser healers go oom drop them out of the
chain and catch up the slack with the more mana better ratio healers. Kill
the mob before it kills you.

Let the rangers heal anyone who catches aggro that wasnt supposed to ( they
killed fritz!, ie let them die). If the uber mob has an aoe (many do) have
one cleric , druid, beastlord , etc mgb a group heal to cover the aoes.
