Overall I like Magelo, especially the automatic update feature so
I dont have to constantly update the pages by hand. (You have to
pay for that though.) With just a little effort, you can make
really cool profile pages for your toons. An index to all my
toons is in the link at the bottom of all my messages so people
can check me out.

It will break right after an EQ patch, but other than that I
havent had any problems. This last patch took the whole website
out for about half a day, and he hasnt yet posted an update to
his scanner program... I expect that in a few days once SOE does
a bunch of fix-the-patch-patches....
