And just how many womens lives have been completely destroyed by 
overgrown boys who spend all their waking time playing golf, watching 
TV, watching football, watching superbowl, working 80 hours a day, and 
so on and so on, the list goes on.
EVERY possible thing a human being can do is a thing that too much time 
can be spend on. I think its time to start blaming the PERSON for 
spending all the time on XXXX interest, not the interest itself.

I know this i mainly a US problem, since your court system basically are 
build on the model that no person is to blame for his actions, so lets 
find another scapegoat, but its kinda getting ridiculous.
