I'm no expert, and things may have changed since the last time I melee'd 
(my current character is a mage who's never weilded a weapon in anger)

BUT

Here's how I think it works.

For most melee skills, the level of the mob does matter, the higher the 
level of the mob the more likely a skill up is... but there's another 
factor.  You get lots more skill ups on success than on failure (skill 
ups on failures do happen, but very rarely).  SO, although a successful 
attack on a mob 5 levels higher than you is more likely to raise skill 
than a successful attack on a mob 5 levels lower than you, you will be 
getting a lot more successful attacks on the lower level mob.

This means fighting red mobs is rarely a good way to raise your skill... 
and that fighting light blue mobs is rarely a good way to raise your 
skill (plenty successes, but few skill ups).  Blue, white, and yellow 
all seem to work out more or less the same.

Also helpful, if I'm correct, would be debuffing the target mob's AC so 
you hit him more often, and raising your attack for the same reason.

Then there's raising your INT or WIS, or perhaps its DEX... there's 
supposed to be some stat that influences your chance to raise each given 
skill, and I think that defaults to the higher of INT or WIS if those 
are higher than the key stat.  BUT I've heard a lot of other opinions 
about that part.

Another tactical thought that comes out of my observation above would be 
that if you are starting a new skill, you'll hit very rarely with it, 
and might really find that low blues or even light blues are therefore 
better than the yellow plan, and that when your skill is high and you 
have lots of attack buffs and AC debuffs that you hit about as often on 
the yellows as on the blues, but have a better chance of raises per hit, 
so they become better.

Some skills don't care what your target is.  Archery, I think, doesn't 
care.  Dual weild and double attack definately don't care.  Bash, Kick, 
I dunno.  Defense cares... but doesn't seem to care about whether you 
get hit or not, so getting a blindingly high AC and lowering the attack 
value of the thing swinging on you is a viable way of doing things. 
Offense?  I have no idea, it seems to go up quite randomly... but I 
think it does care because I've not seen it go up on greens.

Melee experts feel free to chime in to add to this.. or correct my 
obvious flaws, complete with derisive laughter.

After all, my idea of a melee character is my cleric, rather than my mage

Splendid One, 61 Gnomage, Firiona Vie, no melee skill over 40
Bergh Brelltender, 65 Cleric, Morell Thule, every last melee skill 
capped for the class
