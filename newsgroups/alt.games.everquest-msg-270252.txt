Wish looks to be interesting as well, fwiw, assuming they aren't the next
horizons (great ideas, bad execution). (For those who don't know about
WISH, it plans to be only ONE huge server, and content will not be
respawned...when something dies, it's GONE.  And NPC races will actually
conquer territory over time, so if you don't kill them...the land itself
could change.) Their beta starts Q12005, so I'm hoping we'll know more
about it's prospects soon.

The imp race just makes me laugh...they sound like the ferengies (sp?) of
a fantasy world.  And the dragonkin are pretty neat sounding too...iksar
with wings. ^_^
