Nice selling technic BTW ;)
Even if thats true that AGI is important for monks, this isnt THE more
important abiility....
Look, you said


Of particular interest is where one of the chief game
designers stated that, LIKE MONKS, Beastmasters will have
"better ac bonus for high agility", thus proving once and
for all that AGI is more important to monks than it is for
any other class by improving armor


Hmm that isnt because AGI will increase AC that it is THE most important
stat =)
And oh well i am not sure all the Verant guys know Norrath as well as some
players (or even a lot) IMHO........
