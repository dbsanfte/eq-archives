But not everyone playing a Halfling Druid is doing it because it's easy.
I'm about to start one, because I really like Misty Thicket, because I find
the new Halfling newbie quest armor a very entertaining way to get going
with a character, because I like Halflings, and because I've enjoyed working
with druids many times with my other characters.  Yes, there are plenty of
dr00ds out there, but when you run into a particularly nice Druid, they're
very fun to be around.
