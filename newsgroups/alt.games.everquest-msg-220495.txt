While those are all valid points, the question at hand was
whether the trick of assisting the mob to see who it hates most
before breaking mez is valid, not what method was used to get the
warrior up to the "hates most" point.

I think its been answered in other responses; yes the method does
work but just being at the top of the list might still not be
good enough to overcome things like sit aggro (and even prox
aggro... if you are right next to the mob and the warrior is way
over on the other side of the room it might go for you instead of
bothering to run across the room to him)
