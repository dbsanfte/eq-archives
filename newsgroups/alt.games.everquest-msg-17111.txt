Griffons are caster treats, and should be wearing a sign saying No Melees
Allowed.

They have low hit points for thier level (makes them vulnerable to root
nuke/dot or kiting, but thier offensive skills and defensive skills are
through the roof.

A warrior will not be able to take one until they are very green.   In a
group, you might be better off having the cleric root and nuke it than heal
you while it rips you a new one.
