 The original poster was implying that to get to Luclin you'd need to go
through Warrens and Stonebrunt. That's the part I was complaining about.
That's different than Kunark and Velious where you can get to with a
simple port from anywhere or a boat trip. But if you need to actually
get a port to Odus, then run through two zones just to get access to
Luclin... That's more annoying than missing the boat by 20 seconds and
I'm guessing you'd be hearing a lot of complaints. I just don't see it
happening that way.
