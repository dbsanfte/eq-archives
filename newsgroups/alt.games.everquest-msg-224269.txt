Yep, this makes little sennse.  I think I can see the reasoning, though, 
as convoluted as it is.  Assume its the cleric's duty to provide the HP 
buff for the group.  Keeping you all in Symbol is going to run lots of 
money, heck, even temperance with its long duration is going to cost you 
the same amount as a HOV would.  So instead of using up valuable peridot 
on a lesser buff, why not hand them over to a 65 vending machine and get 
far more HP and AC out of them?

80pp on DOTs?  Have some deaths there?  Or have you failed to get your 
charisma over 106?  There's no more worthwhile investment for a higher 
level cleric than some "shopping gear" to get your charisma up for 
buying things.  As a bonus, don that same gear when lulling and you'll 
get a lot fewer "attack on resist" reactions from fails.

The time to ask for reimbursement for Dots is before the run starts; 
make sure whoever the ML is knows you are keeping track of expenses and 
expect to be paid out of the take before the split.

While your demand is reasonable, your approach isn't; it doesn't matter how
few or many peridot you have on you, you either have enough to cast the 
buff
or you don't.  "Or a peridot" makes sense, but 10 plat doesn't, since the
spell won't run out and buy the gems for you.  And its your duty to 
carry enough peridot to do the buffing, although peopld -should- carry 
their own, most don't; this doesn't mean you want to get 30 minutes into 
the mission, have the MA die or just get dispelled, and not be able to 
replace his buff.

You can demand cash or peridot in advance of casting the buff, but you 
can't do it "because I only have three left" and have the cash part make 
sense.
