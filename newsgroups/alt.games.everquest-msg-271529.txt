If I planned to go to level 70, you might have a point. I figure
I'll top out at 20th maybe 25th for a 'toon. Keep it awhile, then
delete it and move another one up.

But I've already read in here how difficult it is to go solo beyond
about level 30. I think it was level 30. Anyway, I know I wont make
level 70 going solo. Its immaterial to me. I game to have fun and
relax. I don't log in to get xp all of the time I have logged in. A
few times I have paused to watch moon rise. Or had my 'toon look up
to look at the stars. A few months ago a player was casting
fireworks/sky rockets in pok. I stood there and watched. When it was
done I thanked the player. Most others there just seemed to ignore
it. They missed out on a great show.

For me, I find that learning a new game is easier starting out as a
warrior. No spells to track, no extra abilites. Just pick a sword,
bow, or mace, and have at.

The years I spent being a DM in ad&d taught me that players new to a
game have a longer learning curve if they start out playing spell
casters first thing.

No. I'm upset that no miminimum plat was being asked by that player
who scoffed at 2 plat donation for a temp. Other players /ooc their
plat requirements. Maybe the free buffs in the the tutorial sets up
a player to have 'free buffs' expectations. Just like the rat feet
in the tutorial stack, but not the rat feet outside Qeynos, which
are 'lore items'. If no free bufs are now the be al lend all of EQ
1. Then so be it. I'll just use them less often.
 
] And you haven't even begun to experience the game yet. Very shortly, 

We each experience the game differently. Even if I had a 70 'toon, I
would experience it differently than anyone else with a 70 'toon. So
while I understand the point you are making, its not that important
a point.

] most mobs that con blue to you will tear you in half. You'll be dead 

Yeah, I have read the stats. Tear my 'toon in half anyway.

] You will be the king of running away. You won't be able to survive adds, 

Or... I wont go to that zone.

I'm not playing for constant disappointment. I'm playing to relax.

Exactly.

6 months, but yeah new.

I know some folks who play EQ 1. But I decided that since they had
such high level characters, I wouldn't learn the game if I grouped
with them. It would be, in my opinion, power leveling in the worst
possible manner. I even avoided the servers they are on. So I can
learn at my pace and time available to play. I know my work and
sleep schedule is different than theirs, so I don't think it would
work for them and I to group anyway.

] 2) You like to solo and don't like to group

Yeah, I get enough from yammerheads where I work. I do know lots of
people are smarter than I am. But I get enough from people at work
who cannot spell, read, and write.

Getting away from groups lets me relax.

] 3) You feel you need temp in order to make any sort of reasonable 
] progress with your low level warriors.
] 
] The conclusion is inescapable: Don't play warrior. You won't enjoy it.

I've been playing warriors since June, 2004. Its gotten tedious for
the xp grind from time to time. I decided to create a berserker
recently. Seemed more interesting to play, except no taunt.

I did make a mistake on bind wounds, some of my 'toons have that
skill up in the 20s. And they are not even to 9th level yet.
