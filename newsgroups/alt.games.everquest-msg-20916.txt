Ok well then I'll concede that you learned about Tailoring or trade skills
in general a lot sooner than me. At 5th I was trying to max out 2hs with a
bronze 2hded sword I had no time to think about trade skills, they were for
high level characters to waste their time on, or so I though at the time.

At around 6 or 7th I started keeping bonechips instead of selling them to
merchants, I had seen the build up of a Hate raid for the first time,
players offering 5pp for stacks of Bone chips...there is no shortage of
skeletons in Nek. By the time I left Nek I prolly had 50pp, wielded a SBH
and had a bronze BP (that was medium and weighed to much)

CF
Those were the days...when everyone in the party melee'd :ï¿½)
