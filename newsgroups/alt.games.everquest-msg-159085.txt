A mob is in "summoning mode" when a set amount of damage is done.  It doesnt
matter if this is melee damage, DS damage or spell damage, once hes past his
summoning % he will summon whoever is on his agro list (and at the top)

So yes a mob thats been damaged by a DS can and will summon the monk, but
the monk is obviously on the agro list by agroing the mob in the first
place.

If you get too close, they will both agro you.

I used that tactic to solo in Ill Omen in my early days, pull a red sarnak
or goblin, fd it on the other, then mop up when 1 was dead
