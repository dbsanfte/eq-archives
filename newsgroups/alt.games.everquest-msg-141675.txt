In the past when I had a proc'ing wep it was noticible, but currently I just
have a damage dealer, and the proc from the WW form is noticibly frequent as
well as the critical hits from my weapon. I can get 1-2 crits in a whole
fight, with WW if get atleast double that and sometime very close in
succession.

Maybe the effect increases marginally over 200 much like INT does?
