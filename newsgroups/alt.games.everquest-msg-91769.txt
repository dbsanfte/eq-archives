Sounds like hitting Dalnir Level 2.  "Invis, Lev, Jump down, and get 
against the wall!  We'll pull to here."

As usual, I was in a hurry when I typed it and didn't fill in all pertinent 
data.  We could storm in with a 45 war, 50 Ran, 51 Wiz, 46 CLC, 46 DRD, but 
we are going to do it more as a fun raid for the lower chars ( 37 Enc, 36 
Drd, 25 Clc, 32 War ).  We'll probably have 1 or 2 higher level ones there 
because they don't have alts at 20+, but they will only jump in if needed.  
I imagine the level 40 Chancellor would eat the 4 of them alive, so a well-
timed Ice Comet may come in handy...

We'll probably fight our way in, either from the back door or the front, 
whichever inconveniences the EXP groups the least.  If it's busy, we may 
skip the fighting in part so as to not take away the kills from the regular 
groups and hop straight to the room.

About how many spawns are in his room?  Full house or just a couple?

What about the other "room" in there, the room with Weaponsmith Ko'Zirr and 
Imperial Escorts?  I don't know any Iksar SKs who need the quest drop, so 
are they worth messing with with our higher level chars?  Any drops?
