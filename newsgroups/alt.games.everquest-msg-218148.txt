Nah, a rogue and a mage.
Pet's can't hold aggro over PC's so a rogue is the tank with no healing
backup etc.
Only option for the rogue basically is throwing and we all know how
effective that is :P.

Any of the pure melee types wih a mage is rather crappy. On the other hand,
any class that can cast (or sing) is a formidable duo with a mage :).
