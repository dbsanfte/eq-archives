Somewhat twinked but not uber.  What we have going for us is a more
twinked SK with a Fungi Tunic and nothing but DPS.  SK, warrior,
beserker, wizard, bard (ok, so a bard isn't exactly DPS but those
haste/atk/mana songs sure do help).  Then we supplement with whatever
comes along.

The issue with getting the stone was time, as in we only ever logged
on when we got together and wanted to just 'hit it' immediately.
Never really needed it until we got things worked out and started the
sub-25 minute completions.  Also, I as a troll never got a message
about the "hushed message" or whatever it was.  Nothing in my home
city, nothing in BB camp, nada.  Talked to everyone in my home city,
Vual Stoutest in BB, some dude in EC, and then finally a druid came
along and told me about the frog in Rathe.  Went there and now I've
got the stone.

So next week I'll test the magus-wipe theory.
