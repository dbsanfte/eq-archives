I would've liked to see SOE extend the corpse decay a little longer,
like maybe 2 weeks.  I figure if you can't get on in that length of
time it doesn't matter to you.

Technically if they suspend their EQ service they lose their account
and characters so that's not a good argument.  ISP maybe but I would
think you could make a quick CR before you cancel it.

I mean really, all it takes is some plat at worst, some time at best.
And a GY is dumbing down the game no matter how you slice it.  If you
die in a spot, you don't magically appear somewhere else unless you
have a PC do it.  This is just giving in to the whiners, pure and
simple.

if you can't log in in 2 weeks you have other issues to attend to than
playing a game.
