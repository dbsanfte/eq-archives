This is exactly what certain Islamic scholars have
accused bin Laden of doing, although they get very
little air time.

There are more than a few critiques, by Islamic
scholars, of his Declaration of War on the United
States, that dissect his (inappropriate) use of
verses from the Koran to justify jihad.

The sad things are, that so many non-Muslims
believe bin Laden's version, and that those
particular soundbites get wheeled out, by the
media, to "prove" that Muslims exist only to kill
non-Muslims.
