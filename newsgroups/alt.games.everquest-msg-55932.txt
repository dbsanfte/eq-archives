As distasteful as I find your 'Get over it' phrase, you're quite right.
None of the EQ game boxes indicated Win2k or XP support so technically SOE
owes us jack shit for those of us running those OS's.

On a more 'human' side, sooner or later a company like SOE has to come to
the realization that a vast majority of the *nerds* playing their games, are
infact playing said games on those exact 'nerdy' OS's.

IMNSHO, the Right Thing(tm) is to make the game totally 2k/XP compatible
because thats simply where alot of people have moved/are moving for OS
choices.

The one shining truth is that as computer hardware/software consumers, we
tend to drop old stuff (read - old, outdated, un-supported
software/hardware) without a second thought and go after the next shiniest
bobble in the box, if nothing else just to be able to say, we're 'up to
date'.

Video games being no exception.
