Well, it goes like this.

Bryan said: "There have been no cases of smallpox in the last ten years
that cannot be traced to a known laboratory stock."
Falsa said: "Not entirely true. There have been no known cases, but
according to..."
Bryan said: "Okay, it's also not entirely true that there have been no
cases of pink pixies."
Falsa said: "You are so right, there have never been any cases of small
pox, it's a myth, it simply has never existed... Do you have any idea
how stupid you sound?"

Now, I apologise in advance to those who understood this already (Falsa
obviously didn't), but what Bryan was saying was this: Saying that it's
not entirely true that there have been no cases of smallpox in the last
ten years that cannot be traced to a known laboratory stock is
equivalent to saying it's not entirely true that there have been no
cases of pink pixies - i.e. There WERE no known cases that could not be
traced to lab stock.  He didn't say smallpox never existed.  Not once. 
Someone out of Falsa and Bryan sounds stupid, but it's not Bryan.

And then to top it all off, Falsa even said:

Hopefully I don't have to point out the irony there...

Aziraphale's eyes opened.  His right hand patted his chest.  He sat up.
"Paint?" he said.
Crowley nodded.
"What're they playing at?" asked Aziraphale.
"I don't know," said Crowley, "but I think it's called silly buggers." 
His tone suggested that he could play, too.  And do it better.
