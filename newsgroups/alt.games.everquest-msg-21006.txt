Well, let's compare Wizards against their two most comparable classes,
Druids and Mages.

Compared to the Wizard, the Mage looses:

Ports
Root


However, compared to the Mage, the Wizard looses:

Pets
Damage Shields
Bolts
Summoning spells


Take into account that Wizards also loose out to mages in the one
category wizards are supposed to be superior in.. fast damage.  In
between the damage the pet does and the Mage's nukes, the Mage can and
will outdamage the wizard in short periods of time.  And, thanks to
that pet, they are also far superior to wizards in terms of long-term
damage in exp grind groups.

Now, let's compare Wizards to Druids.

Compared to the Wizard, the Druid looses:

High powered nukes.

Compared to Druids, the wizard looses:

Dots
Buffs
Heals
tracking
foraging
regen
Earlier (and in many cases, better) port locations
fear
pets
sow
resistance debuffs
damage shields

And I'm probably overlooking a few other advantages the druid brings.
As you can see, the Wizard simply does not compare with the Druid in
terms of group utility.  And should the Druid not be needed as main
healer in the group, they can also come pretty close to Wizard damage
output, in between their own nukes, dots, and damage sheilds.
