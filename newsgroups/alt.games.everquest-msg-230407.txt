Yep, have killed him at a few stages of my career now....(alot more
recentley though, as it was barring on being completley trivial).

From needing a raid there in the early 50's and having only a CHANCE to
succeed, to being able to duo him with almost any pair of 60+. Dont get me
wrong, phinny is quite a monster if you are at the 'appropiate' levels.

Repeatedly taking a full raid down there is not really possible as people
want to do so many other things, so I (and the bard in question, I guess
:) ), were happy when it was possible to do him with little fuss. Mainly
because of the rarity of the bard epic drop (the bard epic being one of the
epics that is still very worth it).

Changing topic slightly, for me *most* of the epics are still worth doing
for most people.

Ones still worth it:

Cleric (free rez)
Bard (haste proc, 80% all instruments, weapon)
Rogue (40% worn haste, 40atk, 9ac, 15/25)
Monk (40% song haste, 40atk, 12ac, glove slot, nice stats)
Ranger  (40% worn haste, 30atk 13/21, 50% slow proc on earthcaller)
Wizard (800hp rune + 3m per tick)
Warrior (+500 hate proc)
Beastlord (40% worn haste / 55% slow proc)
Mage (manifest elements, summons epic pet)
Druid (55hp dot for 3mins)
Shaman (1.2k dot done in 90seconds (creeping dot))

Epics NOT worth the bother (in MY opinion):

Paladin (150dd + 1.5 sec stun, 35/40)
Necromancer (55dot + snare)
Enchanter (66% clicky haste)
Shadowknight (lifetap dot, 50hp a tick for 5 ticks)

Could possibly move the warrior to the not worth it list depending on there
resources, but would imagine it would be easier to farm the cash (and maybe
take less time) and buy an EB weapon of some sort than do the epic. For
non-high end uber people, most of the epics do still hold up against newer
items (I would always use swiftwind for archery if I had it, unless I can
get another 40% + 30atk weapon with better stats, that CANT be used in
primary (timespinner maybe? :) ).

Yes, I am bored hence the rambling :)  (currentley camping
stormfeather...SHOW YOUR FACE DAMN BIRD!!!)
