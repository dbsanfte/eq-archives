No the roguee will not always die , but then again no rogue is going to be
willing unless there is a setup procedure to res him if he needs it . That
set up cleric can be kos to giants since it is fairly easy for the non kos
rogue to drag his corpse himself if he produces one. I am not sure at all
about the FV server but it would seem to me very odd if only evil races went
pro giant. Pro giant has a number of advantages and on most servers
represents half of the population and almost all of the high end guilds.
