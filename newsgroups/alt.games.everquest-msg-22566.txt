    These people are Oasis level - most can't see when medding, and don't
have friends to tell them something bad is coming. It can also be difficult
to scatter when engaged with a level-appropriate mob on the beach.

    This is a new server. Cash for SoW? Especially when baking is nerfed,
and these people are fighting lootless Oasis gators for XP?

    New server. If anyone HAD been of level to kill SGs, Fansy wouldn't have
been able to train 20+ giants at once (as was done at one point, with Cazel
also part of the train).

>Or abandon the zone
>to the "goods",

    That was the bone of contention, and why Fansy was such a success. These
people didn't WANT to have to abandon their fat XP teat to go elsewhere. In
many cases I imagine they either didn't know WHERE else they could level at
that level, or the areas in question were controlled by the Newts.

    Another positive point for Fansy: on a one-character-per-server server,
Fansy went to SZ with the express purpose of causing maximum carnage.
Outside of guilds like Flowers of Happiness, you don't find many people
willing to use their only character slot for such things. Then, look at the
zone: most of the zone is non-aggro, and anyone of level to hunt the
low-level stuff there would die instantly if trained. When Fansy said "Corp
Por" when training, he wasn't kidding. ;-)

>There are many creative ways to handle this in the planned
>anarchy that is SZ.

    Some were tried. I loved the counter-train idea one high level bard had.
But in the end, you run into one simple fact: Fansy didn't care if he died,
he'd run back down in minutes and start training again.

>>Random giant train up the

    I see it as a feature, and I was sad to hear the GM had to make up rules
to stop it. "You have nullified this rule by being low level..." - WTF?

>All part of the fun of a free-for-all server like SZ, in
>my view.

    Yup, I just wish more things like that had happened to give the server
the "all-out war" feel it could have had instead of the slow, inevitable
crush.
