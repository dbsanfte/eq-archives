I cancelled my account about a year ago so I could focus on school.  After a
few months I regained my senses, quit school, and tried to reactivate my
account.  I had to call Verant to reinstate, and in order to use the numbers
again I had to give all sorts of personal information that I used to get on
the first time.
So...either your friend will have to buy his own copy -OR- if you really
trust them you could give them the info they will need -OR- be present
during the phonecall to Verant to hand out needed info.
This info is correct to the best of my knowledge, but then again I drink
quite a bit.

Good luck.
