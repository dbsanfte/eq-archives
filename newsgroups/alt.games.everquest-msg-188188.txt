To answer the question, if you're proud of being an ill-tempered,
rude, offensive, abusive bully, then you've got some serious problems.
What's "wrong" with it is it makes you a horrid excuse for a human
being. But, if you're proud of that, fine. Don't whine when you
realize that nobody respects you because of it. Don't whine when you
someday find you're alone.
