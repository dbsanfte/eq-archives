Nah, it's a little like acting.  The guy creates two morphs and one's fairly
polite and self-deprecating and the other's much nastier.  If he wants to be
nasty and profane to someone, he uses the latter morph.  If he wants to
remain polite, or even bait people without being confrontational, he uses
the former.  It's just a matter of dividing up your posts by styles and
assigning them to different morphs in order to be consistent.  He won't be
directly insulting and vulgar with Lonely Guy.  If he wants that, he'll use
Hotwizard instead.  (He is pretty insulting with Lonely Guy as well, but he
paints himself with those same insults)

Check out this thread that popped up years ago on a newsgroup I read back
then.

It'll give you an idea of morphing and how people do it.
