I can see you regard them as impertinent.

These issues are addressed in many pro-Wiccan, as
well as anti-Wiccan forums. They are neither
recent, nor uncommon.

You said you couldn't see the paradox... so
apparently part of it, IS news.

Says who?

The Word of God is the ultimate authority in
Christianity, who or what is the ultimate
authority in Wicca?

It was a bit of a trap, I'll admit, but you
weren't the one I was expecting to fall into it.

The "explanation or modifier" is in the source of
the quote.

The sentence has connotations. It is a quote from
the Book of the Law. The meaning cannot be
divorced from Crowley's words.

Of course, once you separate it from Crowley, and
dilute it with a cute, new-agey, fluffy bunny
caveat, it does tend to lose a lot.
