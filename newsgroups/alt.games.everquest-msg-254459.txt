I'm trying to complete the very last item in my newbie Paladin 
Truthbringer quest, the Greaves. It calls for a Coyote pelt. I've looked 
all over Ro and I've found a low quality coyote pelt and a ruined coyote 
pelt, but no "coyote pelt". I've tried to combine both of those but it 
fails so I guess it really is looking for a normal "coyote pelt". I have 
never seen one, I've never seen it on a vendor and, as I've said, all 
the hides I've found on coyotes have been either low-quality or ruined. 
Do I just need to keep killing the scant few Coyotes in Ro or is there a 
different type of coyote I need to be working on (like a higher level 
version)?
