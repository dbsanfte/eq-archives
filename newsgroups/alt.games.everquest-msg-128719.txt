On a side note, I am a mid-30s cleric and recently a 60 ench cast
C3 on me in exchange for my rezzing his friend. (We are talking
about the third-level clarity spell, right? has a longer name
which I forget). Whooaaaa....That was my first experience with
the real, true crack -- a casting class's pure, clean smack. Man
that is high-quality stuff! The mana just _flew_ back in, and for
a looong time. Talk about addictive -- that scruffy-looking dwarf
cleric going around Cazic Thule begging for a hit from the 60
enchanters will be me.
