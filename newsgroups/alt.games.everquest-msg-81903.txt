You can move over to the Crossroads--from the Kaladim entrance as you
face away from the entrance, hang a left; the road will eventually
start going south and you'll reach the Crossroads, where there's a
small building with two guards and Nyzil Bloodforge, another guard
type (there are two forks in the road; the one going east will take
you to the Greater Faydark zone and the one going south will
eventually lead to the Dagnor's Cauldron zone).  There are various
wandering mobs like giant bats, goblins, large snakes, dwarf
skeletons, etc., and guards are near by in case you get into trouble.
