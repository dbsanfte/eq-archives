I got it to over 100 while camping Gynok in Befallen, just begged from the
nearest rat. Only problem was the newbies killing my begging rat once in a while.

I also trained it in Kith when foraging for Oak Bark, pull bixies and keep
begging from them, they cant hurt me at all. Again only problem is that some
people seems to think they need to save my level 36 butt from a level 3 mob, so i
have to go pull new bixies to train.
Got it to 160 or around that now, best beg i made gave me 1 sp, so dont think ill
ever make money on it, just do it when camping stuff, and got a hotkey for
begging while in combat.
