Sup Wizzies, Inkies, and all other c00l EQ 4dventurers out there!
1337 Master here with a Q for an A from you!
(hehe sowwy for the bable, just having fun after I read that other thread..
you know if you know)

But yeah....! My question is: If a have KEI, and then I am rez'd... will my
KEI remain?
The other day I died in OT and poped back in SH. I went to the Nexus and
wanted to get KEI before I was rezed by a friend in OT. I asked the same
question and someone said "No.". Just wondering if this person was correct,
and that I made the right decision to not waste my money on the KEI because
I was going to be rez'd.

50 Y0! zupzupsup! What's the A of my Q? You wizzies and Inkies out there!

lol
