Because Verant employs too many idiots.    They are unable to distinguish
between information that the character has, and information that the player
has available, therefore they go on the assumption of "The character shouldn't
know this information, therefore we have to hide it from the player as well."

In reality, all it does is force any potential grouping situation between two
people with purple names to begin with an out of character discussion, ("Hi,
what class and level are you?") in order to get the required information to
know if it will be a workable group.
