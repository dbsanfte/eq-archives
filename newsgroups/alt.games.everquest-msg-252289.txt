Yes yes, I hear you.  I know it is, I just haven't bothered looking for 
it.  Even now I'm not sure I want to.  Its different, but its not 
necessarily a bad thing.  For example, a couple people have suggested a 
simple fix; add the habit of swiveling right/left before moving the eye 
forward: if I'm -not- in the eye, and am sitting (already have that 
habit ingrained) then I won't move.  Sitting facing a wall was also 
suggested, so that if I pop out of eye mode and stand up (which only 
happens moving forward) I'll just slam into a wall, instead of running 
into trouble.

My initial complaint, if you want to call it that, was that something 
was happening that was not the way I remembered it from when I last 
played, 5 months earlier, and that I'd figured out what it was at last. 
  Not knowing it was happening, just that something weird was going on, 
was definately an oddity.

I'm still wondering if there aren't times when it will be handy.

Those are always my favorites, the "we barely made it" ones.  Easy bores 
me, and failing outrageously makes me feel we were stupid to try. 
Failing or succeding by a hair's breadth, well, either way I love it 
(although given the choice I'll vote for success)

Splendid
