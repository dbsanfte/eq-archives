This doesn't work for bags and such but for Items it works great. Go to a
city use a public tradeskill device (Oven, potters wheel, loom, ect) place
items in the compartments. First off they are out of sight, second they will
not despwan ( left summond food and drink in there overnight). I personally
use Eudrian but most city potters wheels and ovens are hardly ever used I
have yet to lose an item even transfered a Fungi Tunic, of course no one was
in town at the time.
