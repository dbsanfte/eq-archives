    If people didn't care about loot because it was "just a game", then you
wouldn't have had the original post. For whatever psychological reason,
people want reward for time put in and the chance at reward isn't enough. It
has to be tangible.

    Min-max'ing and wanting reward for effort put in go hand in hand. I
imagine you would have lost those people anyways once they found out that no
matter how much time they put in they got the same number of Skinner pellets
as the next rat.
