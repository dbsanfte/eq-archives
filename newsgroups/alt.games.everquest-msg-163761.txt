}names.

I found out just how dangerous names like these can be last night.  I needed 
a new bazaar vendor, so I created a gnome and named him Micromerchant.  Ran 
him straight over to the gfay spires.  Fought a couple bats on the way.  
Then, at the spires, I decided I just couldn't bear the idea of being seen in 
public with a name like that, so I camped out, selected him from the 
character list, and hit delete, confirm.  Strangely, he was still on the 
character list, so I hit delete, confirm again.  Then he, and the 41 monk 
just below him on the list, vanished into the ether.  *Panic* *scream* 
*petition*...  Still hoping Mikaya can be returned from the void.  So just 
remember, make dang sure you want that name, because this deleting thing can 
be hazardous.  By the way, Micromerchant was the name listed in -both- 
confirm boxes, so this really is a bug, sort of.
