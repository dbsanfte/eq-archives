Since Tuesday I have been unable to play EQ due to packetloss in the
50-75% range.  It started not long after the World Trade Center
explosions, so I assumed it was due to network instability and
overloaded links (I live in NYC).  Shortly thereafter my ISP went down
due to power being cut to all of lower Manhattan.
On Wednesday I opened accounts with two other largish ISPs, and was
able to confirm that EQ exhibited the same problems with all of them. 
I then went to the EQ support pages, and saw something about IRQ
conflicts, and sure enough my network card and my video card were both
using IRQ11, which shouldn't cause trouble, but was worth
investigating.  I have since upgraded my video card, physically moved
my ethernet card, installed latest drivers for video and network,
futzed with BIOS, and have finally gotten video and network on their
own IRQs, and not conflicting with anything else (windows did not see
a conflict previously, but given the way that EQ takes over the
graphics subsystem, I figured better to be safe than sorry).
Everything else seems to run great, I'm able to download at
14kbytes/sec from just about anywhere, I can ping and traceroute to
the EQ servers without loss, and log into the Station without
problems.  It's when I start EQ that things break.
Generally when I start EQ now, it takes about 10 seconds after
entering my account info to have anything happen, then I may or may
not make it to character select screen after about 5 minutes.  If I
make character select screen it takes about 5 more minutes to log into
the game, if I don't crash back to login server again.  I crash to
login server almost every time I zone, and the packetloss is
constantly at 50% or greater.  Of course my pings are nice and low.
I have tried the following fixes:
switch ISPs--no joy
switch video card--no joy
update video drivers--no joy
update network drivers--no joy
reinstall Directx8--no joy
move IRQs on video/network--no joy
update and patch windows98--no joy
run testeq and then regular eq--no joy
completely remove EQ and reinstall from scratch--no joy

Any and all help would be appreciated.  I think I'm almost at the
limit of what I can do on this, and I have run virus checks and
ensured that no programs are running in the background while I play
EQ.  I've opened an email ticket with Sony, and tried calling them but
they closed early yesterday.  Thanks in advance.
