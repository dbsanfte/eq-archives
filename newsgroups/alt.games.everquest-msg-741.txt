My Druid just hit level 17.  I have soloed him just about the whole
time.  Now, I feel that I want to group.   My question is:  What do
other party members expect of a Druid in the group.  Is it just a
secondary healer and buffer?  Do I play him must like my Cleric and
sit, med and heal or what.  Any comments are appreciated.
