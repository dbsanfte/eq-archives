That was just my weight loss bags heh.  I have tinker bag, DRP, very large
coin purse, a small pouch (4 items 0.4 weight thing), a regular 8 slot bag
(ouch on the weight) my shuriken bag.. hmm theres 1 more i can't remember

Yelinak is a gimp.  Uber guilds exagerate most mobs, a) for better bragging
rights, and b) limit competition to 'their' mob.

We dropped him last night first pull, then sontalak right after.  His ae is
a joke (fungi is your healer for the fight)  Just get a CHA buff before your
kodiaks/c2 (the top 1 gets overwrote), and position him good.  If he goes in
the water its game over.

As for faction.. its easily fixed.  If you can kill Yeli, you can easily
stomp tormy and statue too.
