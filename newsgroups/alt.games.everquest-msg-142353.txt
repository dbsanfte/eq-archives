Hmmm, Dan stated that Paladins "actually *are* part Cleric" as part
of a complaint that Paladins were excluded from the gimp CHeal.
You replied that "[Shamans and Druids *ARE*] *FAR* closer to being
clerics than paladins" as justification for excluding the Paladin
from use of the spell.  I then replied "Relative closeness depends on
how you're viewing the classes...", and we were off.

Now, I never argued that Paladins should get the spell, nor addressed
the issue of whether the relative closeness of the classes should
determine who gets the spell.  In fact, I have mentioned at least
twice that I don't think Paladins should get the spell.  I think that
it would overpower the class substantially, and that outweighs the
RP/IC justification, IMO.  That does not, however, have anything to
do with the existence of a valid and meaningful point of view from
which Paladins are closer than Druids/Shamans to Clerics.

As to the focus of the thread drifting, well I'm sorry, I didn't know
that was prohibited on usenet.

Please address the misunderstanding.  I replied directly to your
assertion that "IC" is not relevant to game-mechanics.

         ^^^^
Here's your problem, which I commented on indirectly in another post.
You are clinging stubbornly to the notion that there is a unique
"TRUE" measure of the relative closeness of the classes.  That sort
of narrowminded oversimplification of an issue has led to unspeakable
horror in some RL contexts (and lots of really bad software systems
too), which is why I haven't let it go.  It really bothers me to see
an apparently intelligent person insist that any complex circumstance,
especially one involving people, is black-and-white.

Again, I am waiting for you to explain the misunderstanding.  My reply:

/quote
is direct and to the point.  I stand by it.  Making game-mechanics
choices in total isolation from the IC/RP point of view is plainly
stupid.  And don't try to tell me that you aren't advocating that
unless you have some private meaning for the word "irrelevant"
that is unknown to the rest of the world.
