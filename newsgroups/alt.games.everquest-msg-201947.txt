At level 19, and on up to about 24, I routinely solo in Paludal Caverns 
with any class that I play.  So far, Wizard, Enchanter, Ranger, Druid, 
Cleric, and Paladin.  I tend to start out in Paludal at about level 8.  I 
don't go out of my way for KEI, I have paid for it exactly twice for a 
twink, and once was just so I could enchant a few stacks of clay in a 
reasonable amount of time.  So, don't be so sure he would have been LFG.
