Pretty Dark Elves.  Hell, if I looked like the dark elves in that game, I
would stare at myself all day!

That aside, I found the game a bit dull and dreary.  The movements and the
keyboard configuration were all over the place.  Guess I was so used to
"aswd" for moving - not that point the mouse and click to have your char
run.

Overall, Lineage 2 was the one that made me come back to EQ and fully
appreciate the game - bugs and all.
