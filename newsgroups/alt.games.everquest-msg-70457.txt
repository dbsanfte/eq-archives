Twinkies join parties, thus it can effect people.

A large proportion of my in game deaths have been twink induced. Some
character with ridiculous gear is in such a hurry to level that they
do crazy things. A lot of these people also don't seem to bother actually
learning how to play their new class. After all, they're just doing it
for fun.

On the other hand getting to play beside a true EQ veteran can be
extremely interesting. Like all these things it balances out, but it
does have some effect on the game world.

I don't really care too much. A person who's fun to play with is good fun
whether twinked or not. And I imagine when i'm that level the temptation
to give a leg up to any other character I play would be hard to resist.

That said I have run through EC and Nro and seen all the hunting spots
within my level taken up either with twinks or power-levellers....And 
the hard core of both these species are not interested in working with
other gamers.
