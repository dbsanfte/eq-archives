   Well, just in the name of science, I ran some photos I'd printed out on
gloss paper under water a few times. The paper itself didn't hold up too
well, but the ink didn't show any signs of running. I wouldn't worry as much
about water (after all, I imagine the kit wouldn't sell very well if it
didn't make decent bumper stickers) as I would be about the ink fading from
exposure to UV.
