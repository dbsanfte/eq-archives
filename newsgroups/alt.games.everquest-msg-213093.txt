Thanks for the responses, everyone.  I'll definately be looking into
some of those suggestions.  Finding the right spots is definatly going
to be key, so I really appreciate the suggestions.

I'm also going to see about getting one of those Donal's valor things...
after I get my lizard.  I'm using Valor right now as a fast, cheap heal,
so am used to that already.  

Also, I should have mentioned that we will probably be grouping with
Splendid more as he rises in levels (a heck of a lot faster than we ever
did).  Having him along really does help with our rather small DPS.  It
would be even better if the shaman comes along for the ride too
(crossing fingers that the one is going to be okay!).
