I disagree with you're opinion that no evidence can be irrefutable,
that is why it is called evidence.  There are times when people
involved in the process plant or manufacture evidence but there are
many cases where it's just not reasonable to find other than guilty.
Maybe you are correct that nothing is ever 100%, but the odds are
better than 99.9999% in my opinion.  After all, Einstein did prove
that 1+1 does not equal 2, so even mathematics is not absolute.

To the second point you made, no I don't believe you did call it that.
I just am not on this group frequent enough to reply to each post so I
sometimes address multiple posts in one figuring most people involved
in the thread will read it and understand the point was addressed to
them.

In another example of this I will address David Navarro's claim of
"what is the difference?".  Simple, malice.  The state has no malice
when it puts people to death.  The population might, but the state
does not.
