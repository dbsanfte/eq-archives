Do you ever actually use your brain to do anything beside try to
draw attention to yourself?   Did I say druids doing the port circuit
were making more plat than they would by hunting?  No.  Did I say
that druids doing the port circuit were making tons of plat by doing
so?  No.

But you're an even bigger idiot than I thought, as doubtful as that
may be, if you don't believe that a druid doing the port circuit is
generating *some* cash flow.   If they weren't, they wouldn't do it.
Farming bandits in the Karanas is almost as low a risk and provides
a better cash flow in most circumstances, but any druid who ports
as much as one person for one copper in 3 days played has *a* cash
flow.  That cash flow may suck, but it's still a cash flow.

Now are you going to actually contribute by addressing how providing
NPC (or item) ports would "ruin" the porting classes?   Oh, and, yes,
I don't have a druid on my account.  The family druid is on my wife's
account.  My main's a cleric.  (Hers isn't the druid, either.)

BTW, I don't believe that providing item (or NPC) rez's would ruin that
class, either.   Neither do I believe that providing rez's for plat is the
best use of my time.   Being able to get drops on JB guants, ES guants,
two DW boots, and some Donal's boots in the time it would have taken
me to travel around and rez three or four people makes that no contest.
