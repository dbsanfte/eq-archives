The main thing to worry about with this is that if you do it on purpose (I
AOL Im my GF while playing keeps her happy and keeps me happy heh) EQ still
takes all keystrokes/Mouse movement/mouse clicks. So if you type 'a' well..
just hope you ain't clicked on any thing to big (Although when I autoattack
it now targets me... that something new or just me smokin?)

ESPECIALLY Annoying with respects to the 't' and 'r'... imagine *Cough*
Talking to your girlfriend/boyfriend and the message (Or part of it) being
sent in reply to someone you don't know on EQ? Gets annoying at times... I
personally have Auto Attack, tell, reply on F 1, 2, 3 respectively for this
reason heh...

Another thing... sometimes just hitting Ctrl, Alt, or shift (individually,
or one at a time) and then hitting F10 (Screen cycle) will fix monitor
problems that arrise from minimizing EQ...

Not sure how this works for other OS'es but I love being able to talk to my
GF while playing EQ (I'm in military so to poor so far to get second
computer up and running) For once I'm happy with a Windows OS woot Heh
