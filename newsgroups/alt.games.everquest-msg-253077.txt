I don't play anymore so I don't need the key, but thanks for the offer.
During the Star Wars Galaxies beta SOE gave "buddy keys" to many of the
participants and they were good for the full ride during beta, no
restrictions. I was just curious what kind of deal was being offered here. I
have an email registered with SOE for three different games and I'm
surprised I didn't hear about this.
