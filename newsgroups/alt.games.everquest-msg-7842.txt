I think the best advice I can offer is to buy stuff that you can wear for
long time, and not be tempted into buying 3 small upgrades instead of one
big one. Prices vary so much from server to server that it is hard to know
what to tell you specifically, but here are a couple of things to look out
for:

Azure Sleeves: AC=12 Wt. 0.6 - A staple for most monks in their 30's and
40's, they are tough to beat short of really high level stuff. On TP, they
go for 500 to 600 pp.

Velium Fire Wedding Rings: AC 6, 65 Hp. - Again, very common for melee
classes and player made, so if you have any high level enchanter friends,
you might want  give them a tell and see if you can get a deal. Best price I
have seen on TP is 950 a pair.
