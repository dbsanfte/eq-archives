I've seen one for The Nameless, that's it. Lots of Firiona Vies (which is 
understandable on Antoina Bayle).  No idea why.

Per account. You get the choice at the time you /claim and have server name, 
diety, and maybe something that I forget now, to choose from. Once you make 
your one permanent choice it gets added to your Suffix drop-down in the your 
Persona window so you can choose to display it or not.
