I agree, the few times I've actually been able to do that, it's much
more fun.  I remember a raid on splitpaw when it had just changed from
splitpawto infected paw we got 4 groups togeather (about 30 ish) and ran
through the dungeon, we lost about 3/4ths of the people in one room,
recovered and finished the dungeon.  It was a blast, poor loot and xp,
but fun.  

That's one of the (few) things I really like about AO.  You HAVE to do
that on a mission. Unfortunately the missions are booringly similar and
run togeather.  If there was some way to make missions like zones it'd
be way cool.  Imagine you could take a mission of say Sebilis.  You get
some people togeather, everything is up, you go in and there are no
repops, you kill something and it stays dead, there are no placeholders,
everything that is supposed to be there is there.  If you want something
to repop you leave and start over at the begining.  You aren't
intterupted by KSers, Campers, or Trains!

*sigh* if there were some way EQ could do that it'd be a much better
game. I'm hoping SWG will be like this, without the booring sameness of
AO, but I'm very sceptical.  AO just has too much work to be done to be
a decent game, but it's been a year since I played, and they were
working on it almost feverishly, maybe I'll check it out again..
