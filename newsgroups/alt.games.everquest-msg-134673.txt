All the things you mentioned are indeed accurate, but you can expect
the standard fanboy ' don't let the door hit you on the way out ' type
responses.

Sad to say the other games currently available all have some probs too. 
I've played 'em all and I begin to get bored a very short time after 
returning. Although if you haven't played any of them you might find
the differences from EQ refreshing.

I'm treading water with EQ at the moment while I wait for Star Wars 
Galaxies. Hopefully it will take the genre to the next level.
