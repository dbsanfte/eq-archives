well, the higher you get, the less you'll want to be in melee range ..
you'll be noticing this more and more as you get into your 20's ..

it is a VERY good idea to keep your Defense skill maxxed out though ..
Mine's at 195 and I still get hit quite often, and usually for max damage.
;) It does help though, trust me ..

Lady Vox claws YOU for 225 damage!
Lady Vox tries to claw YOU, but misses!
Lady Vox tries to bash YOU, but misses!
Lady Vox tries to claw YOU, but You dodge!
Lady Vox tries to claw YOU, but You dodge!
Lady Vox claws YOU for 65 damage!
Lady Vox tries to claw YOU, but misses!
Lady Vox bashes YOU for 75 damage!
Lady Vox claws YOU for 225 damage!
Lady Vox claws YOU for 225 damage!
You have been slain by Lady Vox!
