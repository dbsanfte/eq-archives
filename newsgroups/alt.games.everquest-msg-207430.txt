"Rogue/Wizard - Wizard stuns, snares, and drops a nice taunty nuke,
then runs
in slow circles while rogue backstabs.  Can you say aggro-kite?  This
duo
can take on some pretty tough mobs; stuff the wizard can't solo due to
too
many HP are cake, and healing should be almost never necessary since
the mob
will be chasing an out-of-reach wizard.  Wiz may have to resnare, but
that
just builds aggro.  I do a variation on this frequently in HoH, btw; I
build
up aggro and have the Guardians chase me around, while my ranger
friend
plinks or melees from behind."

I've seen this work incredibly well, actually. A friend of mine is a
61 wizard, and he can aggro kite anything. He can even take aggro away
from me (58 shaman) after I've slowed, dotted, and crippled.. and that
is no small feat. :)
