The problem is Arofat was *hardly* in a position to play "all or nothin"
He should have taken what was offered, even if it wasn't what he wanted.
At least then he would have had a base to work from, and would have had
a whole heck of a lot more respect from the rest of the world, and better
chance at getting more of what he wanted later on. Oh!, wait, that would
have been too much like a "statesman", not an option for a terrorist.

Yup, slim chance of that happening now eh? (he should have took
was was offered before). Arab gambled, got his bluff called, and
had no fall-back plan, and lost, straight up.  Of course, you 
ain't gonna hear *him* say that. Pali's should fire him and 
hire a *new* liberator.  Maybe Kadaffi.
