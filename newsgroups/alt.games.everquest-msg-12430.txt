That was precisely what I said in my original post - there is a section on
how to do that bit if you are a dark race in graffe's walkthrough, which
kind of implies that the NPC her/himself ISN'T KoS. But as I say, I don't
know for certain (although I'm pretty sure that Camin conned apprehensive to
me last time I saw him, as does the Ogre in Erud's Crossing who is also on
Truespirit, and Ogre's don't usually like me).
