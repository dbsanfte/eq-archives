Well I'm bored.... lets start a thread... I feel like bashing druid
bashers.... I've heard 7 billion threads of whiners saying "druids should be
nerfed" ... "all druids are a--holes"....  As a high lev druid I get fed up
once and a while and lash out with a response...

I'm here to tell you my enchanter kicks my druid's ass from Velious to
Qeynos and back.

My enchanter is 10 times more fun to play in groups & even in solo. When
grouped in a dangerous spot he becomes center of the universe. It's all
about me and the cleric. My friends cry when I say I have to logoff. They
offer me PPs to stay online longer.
The druid in my group is useless. Indoors we dont even need sow. He's a
useless creature. The cleric and the wizard make the druid look silly. He's
a wannabe. He sucks at everything except soloing. Snare? Nah other classes
can snare, sorry. Heals? LoL you druids that think your good healers are in
for a shock. Damage shield? LoL please. Evac? Not with good pulls and
mezzes - and then Mr Wiz handles evac. In many groups the druid the most
useless out of the six. THE DRUID IS A SPARE TIRE. If he leaves us or pisses
us off we can replace him with another "McDruid" in about 3 seconds flat.

Druids suck!
Enchanters rock!

I suspect that druid bashers are 95% ignorant newbies under level 30. Your
jealous because you don't have sow. Cry me a river. Open your little mind a
little bit. Try some other classes before you cry to me about "the grass is
greener" as druid. Really your not qualified to respond to this until you
have two characters over level 30 and one is a druid. Start dinging before
you attempt to comment on things you know nothing about.

You druid bashers that sterotype my wolfie are very annoying. It's a sure
sign of your inexperience.

Don't believe the hype! Slay the whiners!  The grass is not greener! Pass it
on.



ps - here's a pic of my 55 druid with his bear... he's awesome... but the
enchanter is better....
ps - someone please call in a bomb threat so I can get out of work & go play
