I used to duo with a necro in SF, as long as he kept the mob feared (and
re-feared it fast enough) we were ok without buffs/heals.. sometimes I did
have to drop agro onto the pet though (ie fd) and Jak wouldn't be able to do
that....

This means I can kill 2 of my accounts now, the only chars of any value on
either was a wizzy

Thats the biggest load of bullshit.  Do VI even play the fuckin' game?

If you have direcharm enchanters, NOBODY USES A PET ON A RAID.  Not even the
mighty (snicker) mage epic pet gets used on raids if a chanter pet is there.
Thats a fact.

You can't use your pet ANYWHERE that a mob might AE (which is a lot of
places), unless you have a retarded skill that comes with lots of AA points
(and should be given to every single pet class anyway)

The mage pets Burnout AA skill (Goner launches a FLURRY of attacks, Goner
goes on a RAMPAGE) is broken, and does zero extra damage (even the haste
from it is wasted)

From talking with several arch mages in my guild (all with epics), even when
they can use pets, the pet struggles to hit uber mobs (think of you at level
49 hitting the AoW and trying to penetrate his AC, let alone SoL ubers)

Mage nukes are "ok".  They aren't great, they'd most likely come third
(behind wizards and druids) for nuking.
They have BIG problems nuking high level mobs, resistant mobs (only having
fire and magic based spells hurts too)

That alone tells me they don't play their own characters in the game.   99%
of their summoned items range from useless to a complete joke

I had high hopes for my mage.  Sure they didnt have the most exciting job on
a raid, but damn were they needed and made an awesome difference, now?  wtf
is the point

This change pisses me off beyond-fucking-belief
