    Just when you thought you were out, it would pull you back in. 8) With
the ease of killing the spiders, the relative abundance of pulls, the ease
of finding hunting partners, and the closeness of banking/porting services
it's hard to not go there, especially as a melee. You're spot on about some
of the idiots, though - the ones that /auction the drops they just got, or
(my favourite) the cleric that had been there from level 50 or so through 58
and was shocked when I told him only one model of spider drops gems. Um,
hello, you NEVER noticed?

    That is the difficulties. 8) XP grinding only works if the XP is safe -
unsafe zones make for shitty grinds because of the chance of exactly what
you described. You aren't earning crap if you're running through a zone that
made you waste even more downtime in preparing for it (Invis potions in the
bank for PAL/WARs, say, for the run through CS to Siren's). All those little
problems are why zones like Siren's aren't used for XP grinds, but are used
for raids (and in the case of Siren's, guild gem farming).

>For exp grind groups, zones like Velks is a joke.

    No. For XP grind groups, Velks should be the norm. If all you want is
XP, in a pickup group, there SHOULD be more places like Velk's where you can
go get it. If you want loot that's useful, I agree - put it someplace you
have to work for it. But just finding someplace where you can play the game
in some meaningful way should not be a quest in and of itself.

    Until recently there wasn't really anyplace you needed a summon from,
either - just find a friendly bard or ENCH with some time to help.

    Yup, and for high-end mobs if you dig a little deeper you can find out
what they hit for, what AoE/special attacks they have, and even some
strategic information on how to beat them. Yet not everybody is out killing
these mobs as soon as they pop. I think that indicates there's still some
challenge in the game. There's also challenges that you're glossing over,
again - tell me when your guild killed the AoW, exactly? The big, vocal
guilds all seem to think it WILL fall, so it isn't a "you can't kill that"
problem like with Jaled'Dar's Shade.

>not getting back to your corpse for several hours, or even days.

    That had to be pre-/corpse. My buddy on The Rathe had a corpse mule
parked in Lower Guk that was only aggro to the Huge Water Elemental and that
bizarro basilisk, and that was pre-Kunark. (She also made a good loot mule
for King.) If you want to go back far enough and say "I remember when nobody
knew where medium bronze was", well, so do I - but it hardly changes what
the game needs now.

>Those days are long gone.

    Thank God. The old days were a piece of crap. Inadequate upper-level
hunting areas leading to insane guard-camping, exploits out the ass (Savant
firepots, the spot near AoF in CT, Cynthia's freaking pet), and class XP
penalties are just some of the things I'll gladly leave in the past. You
have to admit, today's EQ is a mighty fine game compared to pre-Kunark EQ.

>These days even zones like Fear/Hate where total wipe outs are
>probably as common as it was before, isn't too serious as Fear/Hate is
>so heavily farmed.

    Heh, funny story. Over the weekend there was well over 100 people in
Fear cheerfully doing whatever folks in Fear do, including three guild
raids. Then Cazic repopped. Until the top guild on the server came in and
helped with CR on their way to no Eyes/Brains/Halos dropping, it was
apparently just as much of a mess as it ever was in the past. It's always
been amazing to me to watch how so many guilds still can't get a handle on
Fear, while the upper echelon guilds AoE Amy Temple on their way to CT.

>You're trying to describe "dangers and difficulties"

    No, not dangers. I really key in on difficulties, because it's the
little things that keep people away from zones. And I'll restate my firm
belief yet again: there should be more places where people can go to get
pickup groups for XP all the way to 60. Especially with the new XP-driven
skills system, this gives both people who aren't organized enough to raid
and (this one here is important) people *who have nothing up to raid* places
where they can go and accomplish something that still improves their
character. VI will never make enough raid content for people, simply because
they still want to limit item entry into the world and there's a swelling
number of players capable of going on those raids. But by making XP *always
be meaningful* for people at all levels, they've given everyone something to
do at all times. Some of those skills are so much junk and fluff, but some
of them? Would you like your clerics to be able to cast spells at 25% less
mana cost, at 25% faster speed, and with less aggro? Would a challenge like
AoW fall if you could do THAT? That even means they can insert AoW-like
encounters, knowing that only guilds that have invested the time to gain
those skills could attempt the encounters and prevail. But now I'm rambling.
8)

>When was the last time you saw someone over level 40 who died and lost
>all his equipment because his corpse rotted?

    Bah, the new method to lose all your gear is to be betrayed by someone
you gave the pass, er, I mean to be hax0red. I've seen a fair number of
people get wiped out that way recently. I've already decided that any guild
that wants my userid and password so they can always have a cleric can go
stuff themselves.
