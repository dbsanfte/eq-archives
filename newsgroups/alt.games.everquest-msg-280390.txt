That seems low.  When I had the zone to myself as a low fifties monk,
I was making about 700-900 per hour, solo.  That includes all the fine
steel weapons and other vendor junk (but not stuff like bone chips or
lambent stones, which I later sold in the bazaar).  Just be sure to
have lots of WR bags (a tradeskill trophy is good for summoning those).

In any case, I agree it's not the largest contribution of plat to the
EQ economy, but it's certainly a good place for people who need plat
around level 50.

Still, I can see why SOE removed the giants, given that they've made
Rathe Mtns a newbie zone for the time being.  The froggie guards can
probably deal with the occasional giant skeleton or cyclops (which can
still be found in some parts of the zone), but a train of hill giants
to the froggie tent city could be a bit overwhelming for lowbies.
