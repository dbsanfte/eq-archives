If you're planning to spend most of your time duoing I'd suggest a
Ranger.  It would not take long at all to get a new character up even
with your friend's L12, and Ranger offers a lot of things a Cleric
does not:  Snare, decent damage, snare, tracking, snare, weak (but
useful) DoTs and DSs, snare, SoW (at L30), snare, & etc.  You would
be able to fear-kite (animals and undead for sure, and doesn't Cleric
get at least one "any target" fear as well?).  A Ranger can tank
within limits, as long as s/he gears for it (ac, ac, hp, and more ac).
I really don't think there's a better partner for a Cleric than a
Ranger, tho any pairing can be played effectively and so the key to
your choice should be what you think would be most fun.
