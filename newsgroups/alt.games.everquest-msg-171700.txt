	I get the impression that they were so embarassed by it (they had claimed
that Inner Acrylia would make people never want to go to ToV again) that
they've decided to pretend the whole thing never happened and have written it
off.  I believe the designer responsible move to the PS2 EQ team, and I've
noticed that if there is one constant about the EQ devs, it's that they
absolutely hate dealing with what they perceive as other peoples' mistakes.

	It's a shame.  The only worthwhile item in the whole place was an
excellent Ranger mask.
