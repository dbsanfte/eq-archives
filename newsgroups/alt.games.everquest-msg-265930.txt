Depends on the PC case.  I haven't seen the insides of the G5 tower cases, but
the Antec Sonata case of my Linux PC is better than the older Mac towers.  The
Macs have easier motherboard access, but the Antec has easier drive access
and easier drive mounting.  The Antec is also very well machined.  You know
how when you take the side panel off many cases, it is sometimes a struggle
to get it back on?  With the Antec, it just goes right into place.  All the
edges inside are smooth (I believe the metalworking term is "rolled", or
something like that), so there is no tearing up your hands.  They even have
a place inside the case for storage of drive rails for the empty 5.25"
slots.

The only annoyance with this case was hooking up the front panel Firewire
and USB ports.  Because there is no standard on motherboards for the
connectors for these things, the case has an individual connector for each
pin, and on my motherboard it was awkward to reach in and attach those
connectors.

Best part is this case isn't even that expensive...I think it was around
$90.

People on the WoW forums have had it work well on G4 Powerbooks.  Apparently
there was a horrible drop in performance just recently, but that was fixed.

I haven't seen anything about that.  I haven't read anything that mentioned
separate Mac beta servers, so I assume they have all been on the same
servers.

I think the main reason Sony segregated the Mac users was because Sony
outsourced the port.  If they had let Mac users on the same servers as
PC users, the first time they wanted to make a server change that would
require a client update, they'd either have to hold off until the porting
company could get the change ported to the Mac, or they would have to tell
Mac users on the main servers "tough...you'll just have to wait a few days
or weeks to play".  (They claimed the reason was to give Mac users a chance
to play on servers that were not full of experienced players and
twinks...but that could have been done by simply having an expansion server
that is Mac-only, while still allowing those Mac users who wanted to play on
the regular servers.  Even better would be have an expansion server that is
new-accounts only, and let both PC and Mac users on it...total EQ newbies on
the PC would have as much need/interest in a virgin server as Mac users
would).

I don't think Blizzard is doing WoW as a PC game with a Mac port, but rather
as a portable code base with system-specific add ons that let it be built
for PC or Mac.  If they are doing that right, all the parts of the client
that care about server stuff will be in the portable part, so if they make a
server change that requires a new client, they should have no trouble
releasing both Mac and PC clients at the same time, so there is probably no
good technical reason to have separate servers.
