   But I don't think that this is exactly what OP is asking about.  I'm sure
that if there was a way to get links to say "Ladies Panties" I would have seen
it in the market channel or something.  So is there a way to actually change the
text of a link?  Or maybe there are some odd "inactive" links in the database
that someone has mined?
