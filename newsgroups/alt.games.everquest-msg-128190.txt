Hi All,

    I have recently decide to try my hands at doing a Necro, and have
really reached a HUGE stumbling block. Hit level 26 and am still using
my level 20 pet. In fact I would say of the 13 or so Research Spells I
am missing more than half, and of course the half are my level 24
spells. I mean this would be like a warrior getting Dual Wield and
only having one sword. I have resorted to taking my level 52 Warrior
into areas to try and get these words, but after wiping the floor in
the backdoor area of the Sarnak fort in LOIO, the marauder/manslayer
cave in FoB, Forest Giants and Gobblins in Warslik Woods, and yet
after hours and hours of killing spawns I get barely 1 or 2 words
after a few hours. Then I mule them over and my Necro of course
proceeds to fail, even after raising Research skill as high as he can
by training. I have even tried buying them in these zone, with some
success, but then once again my Necro fails in making the spells. Very
frustrating.

     If anyone on Quellious server wants to make some nice plat I will
pay 5p for the words to make them. Please I am desperate. Send a tell
to :

Skelllizzy or Lizzyorden

Happy 4th all!!
