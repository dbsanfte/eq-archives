Bah.  I hate attitudes like that.  There's roleplaying, and there's being a
jerk to someone who's trying to be helpful.  The only worse thing is being
asked for a rez, agreeing, then being asked if you have a 96% rez, and being
told "never mind" when you don't.

Paladins are pretty much the group heal kings.  I mean yes, our group heals
will heal more and, at the highest level, take some disease, poison, and
curse counters off... but pally group heals are *fast*.  And, frankly, our
mana is better spent on individual heals anyway... if things go bad, it's
nice to have a good-sized pool of mana to burn on fast heals.

That's something that will always work for ya.  I don't regret the three
months I basically stopped XP-ing and became a GM smith.  It pays dividends
even now.

That's one nice thing about being a cleric... you can easily join groups
where everyone's several levels ahead of you.  No matter how tough the
dungeon, it's comforting to know that your heals are unresistable.  =)

That fact that you are active, not afk, and care immediately puts you in the
top twenty percent.  =)

> Last night, I ran Lenny to Dulak.

Just as an aside... do you have your Pure Blood spell yet?  If not, it might
be worth farming the places in LoY where you can get your Pure Blood
drops... the fort in Gunthak, the Luggalds in Nadox, etc.  Pure Blood is our
best disease cure and is handy for curing slows and malo's.  So if you're
gonna be leveling Lenny up, it might help to do it in a way that benefits
you, too.  =)

/wince

Do you *like* to wipe?  My goodness, may as well just use /shout to ask
everyone to immediately train you!  =)  Nothing the Wipe Gods like more than
to be invoked with such innocent phrases like "One more pull" or "This camp
is easy" or "About to ding".

Jeebus.  There's only one thing worse than an SK who doesn't have FD
memmed...

...and that's a cleric who doesn't have DA memmed!  =)

/shakes finger

*Always* have DA and DB memmed.  The only only time I don't have both up is
when I'm power-leveling my alt in some very easy place and I want to have an
extra spell gem for roots and MoR and stuff.  The rest of the time, DA and
DB are up.

It's not just a way to run away when a group wipes... I admit that DA's
seldom useful for that, especially since you'll not often find yourself
close to a zone line.  It's best used as an aggro management tool... when
you land a CH and the mob begins to pound on you, use DA to get aggro back
on the tank.  This may not be a big deal now, but as you start tackling mobs
that hit harder and harder, you'll find yourself less able to stand there
and take a few rounds of hits while the MT tries to draw aggro off.

So get in the habit, now, of having DB and DA up and using them to drop
yourself down the mob's hate list.  Oh, and also learn that DA and DB are
spells you can click off in case you need to land a heal quick.

Okay, done lecturing.  =)  Back to your exciting tale.

>And when I landed in the PoK, I realized that I was level 49.

Hehehe... you must do like I do, and play EQ without any sound.

Yay Teapray!  The level achieved during the heat of a tough battle is
sometimes the sweetest.

> This new group commented several times on

=)  That's always always nice to hear.  And should lay to rest any doubts
you had about your clericking skills, young miss.

Grats Tea.  ^_^
