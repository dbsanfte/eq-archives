Dual classing was an abysmal idea in 2ed and its no better in your EQ
translation, sorry to say.

Let me think of a L30 wizard / L30 warrior. Here we have a L60 hybrid
with the defense skill of about a L40 warrior, casting spells that do,
what, 250 damage or so?

Yeah I'd really want of THOSE in a L60 group. /sarcasm off

And any attempt to bring multiclassing up to strength invariably leads
to templates. You end up gimping at least one and maybe more regular
classes who's role gets compromised by the new uber template. Net loss
in diversity.

Multiclassing is a bad idea. Maybe in a game designed from the ground
up to take advantage of it it can be made to work. Not EQ.
