	Ok, so there's this pickup wos group, all 67+ cept me (66).  70 Warrior
main tank, mage, chanter, ranger pullin, and...68 paladin...  We were
easily taking the nameds near the nc zone while waiting to form up, so we
filled the last slot with the pally and moved over to that hill with the 
Pureshot and Noc whatchamacallit.

	Woops, overpull. No problem, chanter mezzes adds.  But wtf? Chanter
down to 20% and paladin mobbed?  A couple of big heals gets me heal aggro,
I DA, but have to click it off cause mobs are still chasing the chanter
who dies anyway because as soon as I do the mob the paladin was hitting
turns back to me (!) and I go down before the heal goes off.  We wipe, but
a passing cleric rezzes me and we reform.

	Chanter says "Why did you break the mezzes?" and paladin says "How
do I know they were mezzed?"  /sigh

	We buff up, there's still a named up so ranger pulls it and gets
an add.  No problem, chanter mezzes it.  So what do we see? "A noc
groupwiper has been awakened by Duke Ebayed!" Now-unmezzed mob takes off
after chanter who goes down in 2 hits, I can't keep both tanks alive 
against two unslowed mobs, paladin goes down, his mob kills me, and we
wipe.

	Paladin says "Sorry, I was off tanking".  Funny thing is I'm
sure I've played with this guy before, like maybe last year, and he
seemed to know what he was doing then...

	Should clerics carry essence emeralds?  There was a necro handy
but he didn't have any...
