bear with my point of view for a minute

i see two kinds of guilds

there are raid guilds, where attendence and login hours and gear are
important, raids are usually successful, player commitment is high, and the
only 2 evils are burnout and competition with other guilds

there are casual guilds, where leaders are generally nonexistent, the game
itself is irrelevant, tradeskills are cool, not knowing things is cool
("let's take those newbies under our wings!")

so, moving on from the idea of breaking eq players down into hardcore and
noobs, and not that i don't want to support that idea, but it's also true
that there are hybrid guilds, and that's what this thread is about...

i am in one

it was a family guild for 5 years, and still is ....however, in the last
year or so, they've been doing raids

-- btw, this is an empathy thread --

this guild i'm in tends to take between 50 and 90 minutes to mobilize for a
raid and  generally 20 minutes for buffs (at prep, wipe, etc)

i HATE IT ! SAVE ME! we're not talking about hard things either, i mean like
50 people for agnarr during primetime or 15 for rumblecrush during downtime,
or <whatever> for vt when the raid has been planned in advance

are all non-hardcore guilds like this?

i was once in a guild that was on-the-fly, very fast, no downtime
etc.....but it was too good to be true, and it disbanded when the leader
left eq .... best 3 months ever though.....

but otherwise, is this just how it is?

~TANGENT~

my guild is mostly players from the southern US

not to be a troll here, but is that the reason? are people from alabama
wasting my time? am i just in a rush? are all raids like this, and it was
only once that i found a guild where leadership worked raids in a way that
matched my ideal timetable?

i'm really frustrated and would like to hear such things as "oh, it's like
that on my server too!" and "yeah, unless you have 6+ hrs a day to devote to
EQ in order to get into a top guild, you're going to be stuck in that funk"
....i dont want to know that there is an efficient guild somewhere that
isn't a career, but at the same time, i kind of don't

rambling, appreciative, thankfully,
