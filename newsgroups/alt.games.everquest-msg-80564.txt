Come out the entrance from Qeynos, walk over to the edge of the
pit and slide a little to the left.  Look down and you'll see the
bridge and some gnolls -- try to cast on one -- if it doesn't
work move a little more to the left (be careful not to fall in
though).  Once you get a nuke off, go over and stand by the
entrance, or the little alcove with the tree in it.  A nice
greeting party will arrive shortly -- assuming you're not too
high for them to chase.

PD
