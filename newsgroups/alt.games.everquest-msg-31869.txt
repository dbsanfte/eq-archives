You know, I have the feeling that you are just arguing for its own sake,
because you can't possibly be so wrong without knowing it. I'll give it
another shot, though, because I'm bored.

When I'm at the cinema, the fact that the characters are flat and twenty
feet tall does not break my suspension of disbelief. Seeing the tip of
the boom mike hovering at the top of the frame, though, *does* break my
suspension of disbelief. Same thing in EverQuest. The names above the
heads are part of the *game interface", the same as using the mouse to
look around, and therefore do not impinge in my ability to enjoy the
game (whether I roleplay or not).
