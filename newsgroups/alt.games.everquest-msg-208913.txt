Sure, but as we've just been over either they have to have separate
buy/sell max/min (or base if you prefer), or separate buy/sell mods,
to produce the results we've seen in game.  So it would be trivial
to have items with identical max/min (or base, or mod) values that
would allow anybody to buy and sell them for the same price if they
had adequate cha/faction with the vendor.  Anyhow, the whole argument
is moot, as they won't be doing such a think just for the hell of it,
and the shared plat slot provides the same functionality with even
greater ease of use.  Still, if nothing else, you, James, and I had
a "discussion" without any obvious unpleasantness resulting.  Time to
start selling winter parkas door-to-door in hell I guess.
