I spent my late teens in highpass killing orcs, and am 'kindly considered'
to the inhabitants of the area, all except the bard lady you have to get
past to get to the bank and basement. She still hates me!
As far as the overthere, can i ride the boat all the way there, or do i have
to get off and swim like my guide had me do while trying to get to loio? Was
that just because she was a good race?
