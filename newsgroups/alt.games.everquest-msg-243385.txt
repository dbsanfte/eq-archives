Not sure about the "unknown spell" part, but looks like one of two 
things.  20K is typical damage for both.

Most likely cause: You went through a hole in the geometry and had an 
all too typical 20K (used to be 10K) header through the world. This is a 
bug, and if you haven't already been rezzed, if you petition, you can 
usually get a GM 100% rez for that. (Hard to believe you made it to that 
level and never saw that one before if that's what happened.)

Second possibility: I haven't been there or fought Velk in a couple 
years, so I don't recall, but does he have a DT? Pretty sure 20K is the 
damage you take from a death touching boss mob. At least the guy in the 
Hole used to DT for that much. Any chance you were near enough to aggro 
Velk?

If it's not those, not sure what it might have been.
