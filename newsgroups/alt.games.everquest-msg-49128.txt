I concur, Priest classes, at least, go up by 5 points per level.  My
level 15 druid currently has a 70 defense.  I suspect the limit
is level plus one times five for all classes, but its possible that
its level times five, with no "plus"

My cleric has a 200 defense, so the class cap is certainly not 175.

Ah, here's a chart:

Warrior , Monk, Rogue : 252
Paladin, Shadowknight: 230
Bard: 215
Cleric, Ranger, Druid, Shaman: 200
Necro, Wizard, Mage, Chanter: 145

I suppose its possible that along with the class cap, that
pure casters also have a lower level cap, never paid attention.
I'm quite certain that I've seen the priest classes' cap go
up by 5 points per level.
