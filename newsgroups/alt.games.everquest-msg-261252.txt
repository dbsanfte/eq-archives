Partly it is because it will make the content they are raiding easier.

Mostly I think it's because everyone else is doing it now.  No, seriously.
Raiding takes a tremendous amount of support by a *lot* of different people.
And right at the moment, a lot of that support just isn't there, unless your
guild / raid force has mandatory attendance requirements, or some such
thing.

Our raiding is all voluntary, so for us, we've got a good fraction of our
normal raiders who are just not interested in raiding right now.   For
several reasons.  The explorers want to see the new lands.  Questers want to
work on epic 2.0.    Exp freaks want to do exp groups (even more than
usual).  And the achievement driven are split between those who want to
raid, and those who want to improve thier character via levels.

All this adds up... and soon, even those that aren't too excited about
grinding to 70 start doing it anyways, because it's either that or nothing.
They know that it has to be done eventually, so they might as well do it now
and get it out of the way while we don't have the support to run our normal
raids.   Rather than having to skip out on raids later to try and catch up.

In the normal course of the game, heavy raiders do not tend to level much,
if at all.   Exp gained in raid mode is barely more than what is needed to
cover deaths during those raids.  And a lot of people don't want to hit a
multiple hour exp group after they've just spent multiple hours of playtime
in a raid.
