Sort of Ebay inside EQ...hmmm not bad idea, unfortunately Verant have
already got a solution for /auction but they are yet to implement it. It is
referred to as the "Bazaar Code" being that it will only be available in the
Bazaar zone on Luclin, it sets players up as merchants, so you click on a
player in the bazaar and if he has anything for sale it comes up in a window
with the asking price. Now this was apparently set up and working fine but
for one thing, it worked as required with the old/current UI but not with
the (now) soon to be release, new UI. Whether or not it is finally going to
go live I have no idea. To tell the truth I like your idea better, with the
items available offline and people able to put in a bid for them. Not sure
if bidding would work, though, to much of an oppotunity to grief.
