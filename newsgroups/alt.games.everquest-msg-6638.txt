Most servers, it seems that East Commons is the principle
player to player zone.  Oddly, on Morel Thule, I've made
far more sales in Kelethin, although I still see plenty
-offered- for sale in EC.  I think if I wanted to buy
something I'd go to EC and to sell, GFaymart.

On Luclin, GFay was definately the 'also ran' of sales
areas, EC Tunnel was hands down the best place to
buy or sell, with NFP at the bank coming in second.

Also deserving of mention: Lake of Ill Omen (lots
of twinks go and fight there from teens to 30, and
these are your best customers... not actual lowbies,
who can't afford your stuff, and not high levels, who
can generally just go get the stuff themselves, or already
have better) and Rivervale... lots of people use this as
a port area closest to the bank, especially if you are
looking to buy, here's the chance to get your item
before it goes into the bank or gets pawned off to
a vendor.

Speaking of buying, though, a good idea is to go
to the zone where the item dropps.  Particularly with
Lore common drop items, you should be able to
buy what you want for -far- less than the going rate,
or even loot it for free... just going to rot anyway!

Never set virtual foot on Xev, so can't speak in
