Oh the crime of it, following up to my own post.

Yes.  After some playing with stat food and kei I have just noticed that 
I have a wis limit of 255.  Doh!

Well, having examined my kit I see that both arms and legs are letting 
me down, but not to the tune of 4-6k to get them above +5 wis! Following 
the rules I have been taught all my kit gives wis as the primary stat, 
everything else is incidental and so far I have been OK. I see a need 
for magic resist kit soon, but I will worry about it when it happens!

Anyway, having persevered in Cobalt Scar and got to grips with it (and 
made a couple of passing acquaintances too!) I find myself with 10k in 
the bank.  Never, ever had more than 5k at any time and that was for 
earring kits.  So, what to buy?  I am almost at l52 and will need more 
spells and the researched ones are damned pricey, so I am being very 
choosy now.  Some will go here, but hopefully not a huge dent.

Hmmm, thinks Messi, can I afford a horse?  Loads up tankard, offloads 
Griffon eye and talks to stable boy.  Yes, I can and a choice of colours 
too :)   I am guessing they all 'operate' the same as the four I can 
afford are all effectively the same price.  Now, do I want one.  It 
would help with mana regen, but I will be moving slower during the hunt. 
How much mana is used to summon?

So knowledgeable Druids, shall I buy one or shall I keep collecting 
money and get something else?
