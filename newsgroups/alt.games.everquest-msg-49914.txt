Dear Learned Ones:

In reviewing my dbg.txt file in desperation because I cant seem to stay on
EQ, I noticed lines that said 3 files were not loaded successfully.  The
files were:
Gequip3.s3d
Global 4_chr.s3d
Global6_chr.s3d

Funny thing is that there was no listing for the first and third one in my
EQ directory.  I erased the second one and EQ automatically downloaded a new
copy that apparently loaded fine.  My problem, how do I get dowloads of the
two other ones?  Do I need them or am I making a mountain out of a
molehill--(i.e., they were erased with one of the patches???)

Thanks in advance,

Bob

BTW, what do those files do?
