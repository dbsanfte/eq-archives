If you were outrunning normal mobs like this without selos, JBoots, SOW 
or Run AA, I bet I can tell you what the change is.

Pathing.

Mobs don't run like players, they stay in little ruts; lots and lots of 
ruts, to be sure, and usually you won't be able to tell the 
difference... but in many places its been possible to "exploit" this 
difference in what route they take and what route you take to outrun 
mobs that are actually a bit faster than you.  And most mobs are a bit 
faster than you are.

Reports from all over the game tell us that part of this last patch was 
a change in mob pathing.

Say you move in a diagonal line from point A to point C, but the mobs 
used to take two steps forward from A to B, then one sideways to get to 
C.. but now the mobs are running from A to C like you did, and faster 
than you did it!

Running in a circle around a mob meant it had to make lots of decisions 
as to where to go, and it was never running towards where you were going 
to be, only to where you were when it made its choice, this meant 
frequent diagonals that it resolved by going around the corner, and that 
its straight line course wasn't headed for you anyway until its next 
check.  If its checking more often or handling diagonals differently 
now, then the fact that its running inside your circle would give it 
another edge... it doesn't have to run as far to get to you as you do to 
stay away from it, as its on a tighter radius circle, and there are no 
real world physics in place to cause a centrifugal effect.

At any rate, I may be wrong about the actual mechanics the game uses to 
resolve pathing (the diagonal thing was only an example of how you 
-could- go further to move the same distance in some cases and not in 
others) but I think the basic point is sound, if they changed pathing 
then you have to take a good look at how and where you do things that 
involve moving the mobs around.
