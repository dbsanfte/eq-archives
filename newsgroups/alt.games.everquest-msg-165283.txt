I find that situation rather humourous, actually. Although I am admittedly
biased against the Druid, I can also conceed that he is merely doing
something that the Humanity is based on: Capitalism - "Hooray for me, and
piss on you." That sort of attitude is something I'm sure mostly all of the
newsgroup's posters are 'guilty' of, yet they scrutinize Bod for it while
thinking they are better than he? Hah.

The problem stems from ideals. People are in love with the sound of their
own voice. People like to believe that their opinion and belief system
actually means something to other people... because of that, we have war and
conflict. Culture is the source of all misery.

'It's okay to have opinions and beliefs... as long as they match mine.'

I never said you had to care about staying. Although with further thought,
the longer you stay, the more you would spite your enemies.

Certainly. I can entertain much of what you've said, of course, that's
exactly why I'm not popular here. :b
