Tiptoeing through Kael would be a given for a first time check on
dragon faction, and to get the WL tooth :)
I think the giants in WL give larger faction increases with the
dragons than the giants in GD/EW do, so I'm hoping I can get on
friendly terms with them once I stroll through Kael myself. I'm warmly
to the Coldain but have no illlusions of Wuoshi liking me :)
