Most the groups I've been in have been pickup groups, and as such everybody 
usually rolls on everything regardless of whether they've already won 
something on that particular adventure.

My personal opinion is that there should be 2 different rotations.  
Augments seem to be more common, have to be rolled for on the spot and 
cannot be sold or traded.  Taken to the extreme, a single rotation for both 
augments and items means that nobody is going to roll on augments 
regardless of what they do as long as there's the chance of some better 
loot down the road.  It shouldn't be like that IMO.
