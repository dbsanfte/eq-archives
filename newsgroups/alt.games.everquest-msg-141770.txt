Sure.  I did.  Well, I didn't do it because my friends did.  I just wanted
to see if the DA jump was actually possible.  After you land, you have about
5 seconds or so to look around yet before it wears off.  Then, you die.

I had been told about it as a quick way to get to the epic mobs.  Group of
6, 60ish Pallys, and Cleric, DA, jump, clear area.  Shaman, or enchanter, or
whoever needs epic piece jumps in, dies, gets rezzed.  Go in, take care of
epic mob, gate or port out.
