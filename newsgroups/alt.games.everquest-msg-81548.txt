Actually, *this* rogue belongs to a "boutique guild," and is the
primary 51+ rogue for two other guilds that don't have their own. I've
been available and on time for more than a dozen raids (more than I
can sometimes say for the raid coordinators.) And, the one time I
*couldn't* make a raid I'd promised to be at, I lined up my own
replacement so that the raid could go off as scheduled.

Rogues seem like the "hot" alt right now. Fortunately, I seem to have
gotten in ahead of the curve.
