    A_Cleric_00: "Stop singing mana song and you're out on your ass. Can you
mez AND sing mana song? Didn't think so. Enchanter mezzes."

    That is my biggest complaint with bard mezzing: you lose mana song(s).
When an enchanter mezzes stuff, my Clarity-line buff stays up. So having a
bard as mezzer means slower mana regain for the one class that is the
weakest link in mana regain, the cleric. Bard slows also stink - it's
noticeable. Again, more load on the cleric. I've been in groups with a bard
as puller AND main crowd control, so I'm not worried for my life with a
bard - I'm worried about effiency.

    I've had bards hold down four things before - it's funny to watch them
"twitch" from place to place to do the targetting. ;-) Is that about their
limit, and if not how high can they go in a low-lag environment?

    I think a lot of folks confuse "need to survive" with "need to be most
efficient". I'm the first to leave if the efficiency goes too low - if
"things are too slow". EQ isn't exciting if things are really slow, I'd
rather play an alt or read a book. But having a bard vs. an enchanter is
hardly a massive hit.

    Depends what you're up to. Just looking at the "can't beat a warrior at
tanking":

    SKs are the best taunters going with their debuffs. If the mob so much
as dents an enchanter, and we have no group regen, I HAVE to waste mana
healing that, usually with a heal that's bigger than the damage - my
threshold of risk is low, and having a wounded ENCH on next pull is risky.
With an SK, then, what I lose in "healing main tank" efficiency I can regain
by not having to heal NON-main tank PCs. SK also has taps that can partially
offset damage taken.

    A paladin is also a better taunter than a WAR when breaking mez.
Paladins have roots to control mobs if they cannot be taunted, and stuns to
lower mob damage output - sometimes to a great extent. What I lose in
effiency healing a PAL over a WAR, I gain back with reduced damage output
from the MOB and from not having to heal non-main tanks.

    Both the SK and the PAL deal much less damage than a WAR, and that can
lead to problems keeping up with a spawn if the group is damage
source-deficient. The WAR is also the obvious choice when the method the
hybrids use to gain advantage, spells, is not useful (magic-resistant mobs).
Or where the overwhelming factor is damage taken and efficiency of healing
(ubermobs). But for the average XP grind none of those are factors, which is
why I'd gladly take a well-played member of ANY of those classes as a main
tank.

>People are sheep.

    You can understand why, though. If someone successful says they did it
way X, well, you're gonna stick to way X too.
