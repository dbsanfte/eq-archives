<snip whine>

So basically you had a huge row with some people over a rule that has no =
foundation..nice one.

Tell a GM your camp has been stolen...they will laugh at you.

You all died, they took the place....I dont see the prob, its like the =
money you pay to play EQ is more important than theres?

No such thing as a camp, if I wanna kill summat I kill it, reputation? =
Hmm isnt this a game?

 I wont kill steal and I wont kill named mobs people have been waiting =
for.  But I will laugh at the whiners who scream 'This is my camp!!!'=20

Bleh...friggin campers :P
