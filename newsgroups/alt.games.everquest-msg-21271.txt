The benefit of Vampiric Embrace over Life Spike is that it aggros the mob
less as it's dot spell ... so it keeps it away from you and on your pet
while you fear etc. and if you're using pact at the same time and you're
full health it keeps you at full health instead of the extra life you got
with life spike going to waste. Also the vampiric embrace spell will keep
giving you health for a short time even after the mob is dead.

They both give you the same amount of health, use the same amount of mana
and take the same time to cast ... after using both spells I see the life
spike spell as a waste of cash.
