I agree that many of the models are poor, although we differ on what ones.
I think the elves still look good, can't say improvement but nothing to be
ashamed of.
Humans look ridiculous, can't play my human SK now I think they look so
pathetic.
Erudites, imo the best looking race, look like a cheaply made up alien from
Star Trek, they definitely lost.
The female characters aren't unattractive but seem to be caricatures,
exaggerated facial features and huge chests.
The animation for combat is now definitely worse (ooh characters can now
thru a big right cross...great, all these trained martial artists look more
like John Wayne throwing a punch than Bruce Lee, not to mention what was
once a well animated flying side kick now looking more like a
(pro)wrestler's drop kick, meant to chamber that trailing leg) and My
warrior must have all of 4 frames to his 2HS attack.

Oh well, not something I'm going to be complaining to Verant to fix, just
think the new graphics aren't that well done at all. Armour and new Luclin
weapons look very good tho.
Doesn't ruin the game for me but I don't know what I'd think if my main was
a human warrior and not a Dark Elf :ï¿½)
