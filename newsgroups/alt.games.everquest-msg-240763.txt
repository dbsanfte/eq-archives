}So, they'd probably have to loot only one or two corpses (if they died
}on the CR with additional equipment from the bank).

This is one thing that I think might be an issue.  I wonder how long it's 
going to take for the graveyard zone to fill up with 63,000 corpses with 
just a fishing grub or an arrow on them?  I hope they have a way to detect 
'corpse of no real value' and have it poof, or I'm gonna need a necro just 
to find my corpse in the graveyard zone.  

Perhaps corpses with no no-drop items, with a combined vendor value of 
less than a plat could poof permanently?
