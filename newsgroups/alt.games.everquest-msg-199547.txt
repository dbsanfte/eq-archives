It's better than that actually.  With that particular AA the
Paladin sacrifices him/herself to heal somebody else (i.e. it's
sort of a very painful Lay Hands).  So your suggested shout calls
to mind the black sheriff in "Blazing Saddles" holding off a mob
by pointing his gun at his own head and saying "Nobody move or
the n----- gets it!".
