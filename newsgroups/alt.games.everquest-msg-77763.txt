Hi all...

I am new to Everquest, and enjoy playing the Iksar so far the best.
There is an area I frequent that is known as "The Pit" where most
chars between 5 and 20 congregate. While killing a Bonecrawler there
with my level 7 Beastlord the Bonecrawler ran as it was almost dead,
and it ran right into the rocks (mountain), and I was fighting it as
it embedded itself into the mountain. Now it was able to hit me, but I
was not able to hit it. So I ran toward the troopers/guards and all
during that time it was STILL hitting me, and I would turn around and
look every where and NOTHING was there. I zoned into East Cabilis, and
was safe (with about 20 hp left). Is this a known bug in the game? I
have notified the GM, because this has happened to me more than once,
and the first time I died.

Thanks....
