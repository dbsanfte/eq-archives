That is just flat out wrong for a plate tank.  AC is, was, and
probably always will be, king of the combat stats for a plate tank.

That is exactly backwards.  vs. low ATK mobs you reach diminishing
returns on AC much sooner.  (Again, from the perspective of a plate
tank, which the OP is.)

AC is less effective for classes other than WAR/SHD/PAL.  This is
probably why you think AC is more important vs. low ATK mobs, as
you would likely be below the point of substantial improvement
vs. high ATK mobs at your level.  i.e. for you as a high level
Ranger what you said may well be true, but it is not true for a
plate tank.
