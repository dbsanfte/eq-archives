This is somewhat cheating isn't it?  Saying "my Time-geared cleric can tank
normal 65 LDON" is about equivalent to me saying "my 45 beastlord can tank
Crushbone".  OK, maybe I should move it up to tanking Sol A or so, but the
point remains the same.  Your gear moves you way beyond the point where the
mobs are a challenge.  You may as well be level 70 with "average" gear for that
level.  Didn't someone from a Time guild mention a few months back a raid of
content WAY beneath them where they did silly things like having a robe tank
and cleric be DPS, pretty much just because they could?  

I don't have experience with the high end game (my main is 45), but the level
cap at 65 seems to make it a bit pathological.  A level 5 in good enough bazaar
gear can waltz through Crushbone, and so can a GoD geared 65, in content
designed for people who just hit 65.  If the level 65 challenges followed the
same progression as the other levels, I believe that the tiers of elemental
planes would show a level progression, and maybe Time would be level 70 and GoD
level 75 or so.  I'm just pulling numbers out of my hat here.  The problem is
that all of the high end advancement is compressed into a single level with
gear and AA's as the only factors.  However, the game only recognizes levels to
determine things like xp, con messages and LDON difficulty.  

Anyway, all I'm saying is that the kind of comparisons that make sense from
20-50 may not translate well to 65.
