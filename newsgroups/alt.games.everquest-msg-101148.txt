Get everyone levitating and invisible.  got to loc -357, 883 in OT.
Look down in the pit and you can see the temple.  

We usually rendezvous in the safe room, which is "enter the temple, go
to back wall, turn right, to to big room in end of the hall", and wait
in back right corner of that room.  One scorp will path close, but
nothing will agro there.

Once everyone is buffed and ready, invis up, exit that room, take the
first right and go all the way to the bottom.


Hail, a tomato.
