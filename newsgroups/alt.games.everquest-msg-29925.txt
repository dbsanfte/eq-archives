   Speaking of fletching (someone was, right?) I have
a question that I asked not too long ago another thread,
but got no answer. Is it cheaper to smith silver-tipped
arrowheads (given the appropiate smithing level to minimize
poofs) than it is to buy them from a merchant?  I already
know that fletching is going to be my main skill, but I
would get there quicker if I could get the silver-tips
cheaper.
    Also curious about smithed steel arrow arrow shafts.

Annie  <----  Really wants a fleeting quiver, too.  Please.
