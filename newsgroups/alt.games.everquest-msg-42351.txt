Ooops, forgot to answer the question!

Half elf rangers start at 85 dex and have 30 bonus points
available, for a max of 115 starting dex

Human rangers start at 75 dex with 30 bonus, for a max 105

Woodie rangers start at 80 dex, with 30 bonus, for max 110.

Half elves also have infravision, which makes a huge difference
in the playability of a race... you won't be able to give yourself IR
vision until I think level 30, which makes you either nightblind or
dependant upon others for quite a long time.

Oh, Dex also reportedly helps with archery, although I can't
say for sure.  Archery is an excellent skill for a ranger, though,
I can kill yellow con mobs without ever getting hit now that
I'm 9, snare em and keep shooting while backing away.  Bow
pulling, combined with a good long range bow and arrow and
the glimpse spell, can bring you stuff from so far away it can't
be seen with the naked eye, and by the time it finally gets near
you its had the benefit of several rounds of softening up with
repeated bow shots as it came in.
