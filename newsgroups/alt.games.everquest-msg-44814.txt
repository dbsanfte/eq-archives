You are correct, come to think of it Charasis and Chardok
are seperate zones, I'm confused enough when I see friends
that are saying they are  in HS but the /who all is telling me
Charasis.. now I'm getting that and Chardok mixed up too.

Doesn't help that HS requires an annoying key to get, either;
if they -want- us to spread out, why make it require more
effort to get into a zone?  OK, its not incredible effort by
any means, but I'd guess a good third of the people I've
seen groups ask to come along to HS or Sebelis say they
don't have their keys yet.

The key to CS, by contrast, is childs play to get once you
find out that the faction hit you take for killing the keyholder
is minimal, and you don't even -need- it, its just a convenience
if you want to use SS as a bind/bank zone and not have to
gate/port back to CS.
