I was assuming comparably equipped druid vs shaman.  With big differences 
in the level of equipment, either one can pull way ahead of the other.  I 
have not actually compared equipment closely, but, generally, at least in 
the past, comparable leather vs chain armor favored the chain for AC.

I would not be surprised to find that a druid can still porcupine the 
mushrooms in FG at level 60/61.  At 61 they are easy to single pull, some 
are dark blue, some are light blue.  I would get booboo for a bit of added 
damage, and DoT them, then try porcupining.  They don't hit that hard 
really.  The xp is sub par, but, it's great for letting out some 
frustration on actual xp giving mobs.
