East Commons till 5 - that should only take a few minutes.

Paludral from 6+ - enter from the Hollowshade Moor side.  Kill the diggers
and mushroom in the
tunnel till 10 or 11.  Invis past the fiends to the first tunnel to the
right with higher level diggers in the tunnel and some Fungi just outside of
it.  Do those for a couple of levels, then start marching down the corridors
killing the Shiznaks(?).  That will get you to 22/23 pretty quickly.

After that I would whack Golras in Timorous Deep till 29, then do Cave
Basilisks in JaggedPine till 39.  Those aren't the fastest places, but they
were places I was comfortable with.  After that I don't know.  A friend of
mine leveled a warrior in Sol A for awhile, then Kaesora, then Veksar.  I'm
sure other people know good PL routes.
