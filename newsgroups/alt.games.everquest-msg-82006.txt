The cleric keeps gems, and jewelcraft items (ruby crown etc), only the BD's
BS's Diamonds and Jacinths are used in the end of group randoms

Well I personally do NBG when im group leader, and i've NEVER benefited from
it (donals and SK gaunts in KC hands, BP in uzo, bard stuff in chef, etc
etc)
When an RBG dropped (a massive upgrade for me) I still had to roll for it
with some greedy ass people, only guildies in the group dropped out of the
random

Anyway, on a group like necro.. usually somebody leaves every 2 hours or so,
so when the new member comes, everything is randomed.. i've lost out on 4
lammies, 10 BD's, and some cobalt in ONE day, and the cleric walked off with
3 lammies and 6 BD's - thats just the way it goes.  (I hunted solely in seb,
24/7 and I've lost sooooooo many randoms heh.. thats the way it goes)

lol bs.  The cleric still makes money, because they take a split of the cash
they mlooted, and split the rest with the group.  Thats what happens in HS,
SF, BW etc  where gems don't drop.  Agreed in velk lower floors they don't
do so great, but generally they get to keep non-rare quest gems, and besides
they are still in profit from the last time i grouped with them in sebils!

lol i only found out recently that they sold for so much, even then cuz i

Heiro cloak would be an upgrade for my 60 monks cloak....

they still drop pp, and a cleric can win a roll on a fungi
