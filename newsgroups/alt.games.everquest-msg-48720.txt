Some of the old camps have changed, not so camped anymore. Dont know about
Dyllan, but i have been VERY frustrated to first see im alone in Guk, get both
Gator Legs and Arms, then camped Scryer for 2 bracelets and an orb.
Was there 2 days, and both days AC was free around 5-6 hours a day. Best time i
ever saw before was 10 sec, and i used to farm spider silk i Guk, so spend a LOT
of time in there.
