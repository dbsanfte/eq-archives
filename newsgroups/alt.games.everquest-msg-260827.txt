Yes, for most classes.   Bezerkers, monks, rogues and (non-tanking) warriors
are the only ones not currently hurting for buff slots, since they can skip
all of the mana related ones.

Even when not tanking and skipping mana buffs, I can still run into problems
if I need to leave 2 slots open for the mobs DoT's, and 2 slots open for AE
heal over times.

Thats strange.   What do they cap out at?

To be honest, I think thats got to be just an oversight.    I'd consider
/bug 'ing it a few times.
