Actually fungal on a shaman is a good thing. I know that people always have
KEI now, but if a shaman needs mana fast regrowth + fungal tunic makes
can'ing the mana not nearly as slow a recovery process.
So even post 50 a shaman could and does benefit from a fungal.
Also post 50 a shaman can't take the hits like they used to so he should not
be getting hit all that often.
