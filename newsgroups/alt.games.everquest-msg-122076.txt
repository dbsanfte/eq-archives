I had 17k at one point, then spent 15 on a Jade Reaver, then got up to 5k,
spent 4 on a cloak, now I'm back up to 9.5k after spending 3.3k on a Shadel
ring, 900 on Spirit of Eagle, 600 in Foliage Shield, and 400 on Blizzard.

Damn.  I have 21 Iron Oxides on my tradeskill crap mule.  I hadn't noticed
that the DCG needed them, or I would've said that was more of a bottleneck.
I had found a stack of iron oxide on a noam vendor back before the may 8
patch, hehe, then got one more off a newbie for 5pp last week (he said it
dropped from an earth elemental near the mino caves in Steamfont)

Guy that wants 4k for the Golden Idol of Tunare is selling the steins, 100
for opal and 300 for star ruby, the star ruby one is the PotC one, not opal.
Though I might pick up an opal or two for buy/sell gear.

Didn't mention tailoring, but ok.

Yes, it would help a whole lot if I COULD get a group there.  My group
experiences lately are like this:

You have entered an_level_appropriate_hunting_place_05
/lfg on
You shout "54 druid LFG"
An_annoying_gimp_melee_05 tells you "can i get a port to wc plz"
You reply "sorry, busy"
A_stupid_melee_group_leader_02 shouts "Group looking for
cleric/enchanter/rogue/shaman PST"
Alt_Twink_Rogue_038 shouts "51 rouge lfg"
Some_group shouts "Rogue to our camp site"
You shout "54 druid LFG"
A_mob_no_one_ever_kills_056291 tells you "boring isn't it?"
10 minutes later...
You begin casting Gate.
