Quick update on this here.  Turns out the kid wasn't my guild mate's RL 
son.  Just in game adopted type thing.  I did confront her about it and 
she got really defensive about it and started saying that the kid got 
banned for it.  She ended up removing herself from the guild and trying 
for a sympathy kick.  The way things turned out I am thinking that her 
and the other are the same person with 2 computers or they are RL 
friends.  I am pretty much removing myself from it.  I get enough of 
that soap opera stuff at work offline (working in a bar does that to ya) 
  so I don't need it in game.  I would really like to see the gal get 
her money back but there's nothing any of us can do I guess.  And like 
it was stated in another reply, she hit the trade button.


And to clear up why it happened.  The gal's guild mate needed her to 
bank the money since he was bound too far from a bank and neither of 
them could walk with that much money on them.  She thought she bound 
close enough to the teller to just gate in and deposit it.  My personal 
solution to that rather than give it to someone I don't know would have 
been to get myself killed and drag the corpse close enough.  I guess 
that is a little extreme but so is giving away 10k.  heh
