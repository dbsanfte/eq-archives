Can vouch that geforce 2mx 32mb (hercules prophet) cards working fine with
dx9.
     Anyone who wants to double check how their cards run with dx9 and eq
can jump onto the test server where it is already using dx9 and give it a
go. Thinking soon i should upgrade my card though as I bought this one only
last year out of desperation when I had a huge $30 in my pocket and my old
intel i740 8mb card choked playing eq LOL (Use 'em till they burn!!!)
