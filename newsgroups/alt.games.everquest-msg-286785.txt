It may boil down to who is allowed/has access to which web page.
edit, ftp, etc.

Corporate anal-retentativness at its worst.

It should be setup to allow one group, and someone logs in even from
Ren Faire to keep it updated, to change all pages that mention
server status.

But if they use the same corporate 'structure' as some companies I
have worked for, different workgroups have access to different web
pages. And no amount of 'but its better customer service to do it
this way' memos will sway the idiots who set it up.
