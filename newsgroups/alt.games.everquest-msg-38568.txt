99% sure Verant have nerfed the quest by permanently removing the
planking. I've had the wing for months, but been unable to find the
plank. Various boards have indicated that ShowEQ lists some placeholder
where the planks used to be found in Iceclad, and nothing at all in
Cobalt Scar (where the quest text says to look). Most people have simply
given up looking.

I suppose the fact that they could 'lose' Harla Dar for so long means
it's possible the quest is broken, but I'm more tempted to think someone
higher up finally saw the BFG (id: model 9000) and had a fit heh
