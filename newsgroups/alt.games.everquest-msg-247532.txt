I'm using an adsl router so i think it's another issue; my mail checker is
working in the background every minute anyhoo... Bigpond Broadband has never
had an idle timeout to my knowledge, in fact I've only ever heard of that
applied to dialup where they charge you by time rather than by usage.

I think this is a routing issue but I can't recall why the process of
pinging forces a higher priority to my traffic.
