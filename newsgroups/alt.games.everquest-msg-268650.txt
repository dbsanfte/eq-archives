What "too-controlled?"   Now you can't KS.  Or
power-level.  So what?

First, a low-level that needs help getting through the zone
shouldn't be there.  If you want to help, group with them
and escort them through.   This isn't EQ1 where you needed
to run through high-level zones to get to another low-level
hunting zone.

Second, yeah, you can't buff someone outside your group.
And if you group and they leave the group, they lose the
buff right away.   So no more KEI-queens or whatever.
And no more druid/wizard port-whores.   Long overdue,
IMO.

Seems to me -- IMO -- but it's still too early to see what
the mid-game will be like -- and the end-game is unknown.
One thing to remember -- EQ2 supposedly has *200*
levels and only 50 in the base game.   Even the level
50's won't have a clue what the mid-game will be like...

But they've done some things "right" IMO.  It seems
they addressed the biggest problems in EQ fairly well.
Of course, it IS a grouping game.  Solo players CAN
play, but the game is organized around groups.  A
player who groups will level faster, get more drops,
etc.   I don't have a problem with that *as long as I
can sign in for an hour or so and still do *something*
when I can't or don't want to LFG.*  And there's
more than enough solo content and soloing ability to
do that, at least.
