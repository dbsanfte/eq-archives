That might depend on how far EQ2 is in its development.  They do still
have a large land mass on the far side of Norrath waiting to be
"discovered" as evidenced by the globe in SF.  If they wanted to prolong
EQ's endgame for some reason they could do something along the lines of
creating lvl 60-100 content there and opening up a one way portal to 
the newly discovered land.  A little story line as to why they can't get
you back and they could soak the uberest of the uber for another
expansion and six months or a year of subscription fees.  Of course
using that portal will also require that you have purchased PoP <EG>. 
Just a little something to tide them over while they wait for the next
cash cow to come fresh.
