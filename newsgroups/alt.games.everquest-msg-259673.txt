Although it's possible to see a difference in the peak/off time numbers for
cable, in practice whatever difference there is unnoticeable for all intent,
at least in my location.  I've never been "bandwidth-deprived" at any time
for anything I've wanted to do.  I have a feeling that that's the way it is
for most people who aren't infatuated with continually running speed tests,
etc. :-)

Of course for you, you'll just have to see what happens where *you* are.
