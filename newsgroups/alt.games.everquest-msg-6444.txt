Read the note; it will say something like, "Welcome.  You have made
the decision to become a member of the mighty Troopers of Cabilis (or
whatever the name of your class guild is).  Hand in this note to
Trooper Zaxox (or whatever the guild leader's name is) and he will get
you started on your way to becoming an awe-inspiring warrior (or
whatever class you pick)."  Then give the note to the NPC named in the
note.  If you give it to a different NPC, you'll get that message
saying something like "Gee, thanks, I guess" and you won't get the
note back.
