I was under impression that Uber in EQ meant stuff that not everyone can 
get, even if they are high enough level, or some very high level stuff.
For a level 10 warrior a crafted BP is above his level, and Fungi tunic 
is. But usually crafted is not considered uber

But the same thing happens in EQ. You get upgrades to your skills, 
upgrades to your equipment, and you see upgrades in the monsters around 
you. There's not a lot of revolutionary new stuff, like you mentioned in 
your previous post

Hmm, I don't quite remember the list of spells my shaman (in EQ) got at 
level 44 or 49, but I'm almost positive they were all upgrades to 
existing stuff.

I think it's 10% or so, when successfull. I do remember that overall 
effect was 5% or less. 33% at level 50 would be wonderful, but even in 
this case, how much of a difference would it make at level 20?

Yes, they do. My level 51 monk used his pre-50 disciplines once or twice
