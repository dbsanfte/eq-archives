This isn't the 'what class is best powerleveler' question, because i'm
specifiacally looking for wizard/druid powerleveling. although I bet it will
be turned into that thread.  I have always wanted to be able to teleport,
just one of those things that have always interested me.  But I'll be damned
if I could get my wizard exp naturally.  Keep getting my ass kicked,
grouped, not grouped, whatever.  I know some people don't approve of
powerleveling, but I do NOT intend to use this character to group, so there
is no chance of me getting other people killed and such.  My biggest kick
out of playing EQ is making other people enjoy themselves more.  I play a
shaman and an enchanter for just that reason, clarity to all, shaman buffs
to everyone!  I finally got my cleric high enough level to be useful when
someone shouts 'looking for a rez!', 50 percent is better than nothing,
right?  Anyways, I would love to be able to spend an hour before I go off to
bed jumping around norrath porting people from place to place.  My wizard is
16, my druid is 18.  Besides monk slaughter/feign, what would be the best
way to powerlevel them?  I have access to post 50's of each class, so if you
have a suggestion, please throw it out there.

The chars I could use most easily for this is on my first account, 53
shaman, 16 wizard, on my second account, 48 enchanter, 36 cleric, 18 druid.

For getting the wizard leveled, how about using the enchanter?  There is
always the mem blur, but also he has a self only 24 point damage shield, and
mind buffs for the wizard.. Anyways, suggestions, hints, tips, flames, all
welcome :).
