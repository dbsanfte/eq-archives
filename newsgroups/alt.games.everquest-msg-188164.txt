    I'd say there's a slight difference in that sony have made no attempt
whatsoever to stop powerlevelling - certainly nothing as blatantly "Do Not
Do This" as being auto-teleported away.

    Sounds like a good situation all round, unless those rez sticks were
doing something else unbalancing :)

    Vox is a girl dude. Next time we're in her lair together ill point out
her naughty bits.

> Ah well, gives the bored early raiders something to do

    That's a bit of a tragedy really, considering I know my whole guild
(assuming we got REALLY organised) would wipe mega bigtime trying to take
either her or naggy out.

    How many HP do those two dragons have, do you reckon?
