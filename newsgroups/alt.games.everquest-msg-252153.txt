It appears that we both misread Biz.  He appears to fell strongly that
the criminal aspect of the incident is no joking matter.  Now, while I
refuse to condone the alleged crime, I have no problem at all being
amused at the thought of a financial reversal for anyone who choses to
make a living selling game currency.  They may not be committing a
crime, but they're degrading the recreational experience of many other
folks.  I despise KSers and griefers too, and I allow myself to be
amused when I learn of them encountering difficulties in their chosen
way of proving to the world that they're shitheads.

Nah, he gave both barrels to the notion that any asshat can justify
his personal greed and selfish behavior on the basis of his victim's
"immorality".  He is, of course, 100% correct about that.  Just
because you and I and uncounted other players despise Yantis et al,
does not in any way justify criminal behavior against them.

But I still find the first post amusing, I am one of those who
believes that the root of all humor is gallows humor.  And I'm not
shedding any tears for the victim of the alleged crime.

Lighten up a shade Biz, last I checked making a joke isn't a crime...
yet.
