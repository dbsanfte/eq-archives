We need to give our Guild a shot in the arm so to speak...  I've just become
an officer and am going to be planning our events...

At this time, what I feel is needed is a good dose of straight up fun.  I'm
thinking along the lines of Naked Gnome run or Newbie Demolition Derby or
things of that nature...  Good ways to get everyone involved to just have
fun...

Actual raids will begin happening soon too, but we need to boost morale
first.  Do any of you have any fun ideas or even stories to share that I
might glean some ideas from?

Also, our Guild is for the most part Lowbies...  Our highest levels at this
time are in their 40's and there are only a few of them...  Any raid ideas
for our levels?

Any suggestions will be appreciated!  Thanks everyone!
