I'm pretty sure this was never an option except maybe in beta.

But in answer to the question I get the impression that Verant would rather
we stopped doing /whos altogether but aren't stupid enough to remove the
command.  As much as it's a great idea they've talked about it before (but
it's been a while) and seemed pretty dead set against it, so I wouldn't hold
your breath.

It hurts nothing to /feedback it, though...they've changed their minds on
lots of other game-play issues, they might here, too.
