Well, this is as it should be.  If I come up with a solid analogy, and to
you it makes YOUR point, while to me it makes MY point, that means that we
have successfully illustrated the segment of the debate that we disagree on.
From there, we explore that segment.

I accept what you're saying here, and I can see your point of view.  MY view
is that the Cleric Res is a major part of the identity of the Cleric, and as
such if it is rendered useless, or of significant lesser value, then the
Clerics should be compensated with either the opening up of new abilities or
the expansion of old ones.

Agreed.  I would like to put forward as well that the ability to make cash
off your fellow players might be (and IS in my book) not exactlly a high
priority in this game outside of trade skills.

Then basically, you see NO difference between being able to port through the
POP, and being to get res'd for free (even if it's iinconvenient) if you buy
the POP?

Well, now...  I'm not sure I agree with this if strictly followed.  I agree
we shouldn't be the best at NUKING, or HEALING, or other things that are
obviously the pervue of other classes.  I also agree that we shouldn't be
the best at something POWERFUL, since we ARE so versatile, and we ARE second
or third best in many other areas.

Two second bests however, do not a best make.  We OUGHT to have some SMALL
area to call our own.  Some kind of "wow" factor, even if it's not earth
shattering.

Ah!  NOW we're getting somewhere!  Exploring where the analogy fails for you
and succeeds to me is likely to point straight to the heart of the
disagreement!

And it DOES point to the heart of the disagreement!

There are two things in my answer to this...

Traditionally, in many role playing systems and in mythology, the Druidic
abilities INCLUDED (and in some mythos it was a major part) the ability to
teleport over long distances.  In the EQ mythos, this is done via stone
rings, in many other mythos it's areas of nature that allow it.  I've seen
many of them (including the grandpappy, D&D) that gave the Druid the ability
to teleport by entering a tree, and stepping out of a tree of the same
species anywhere in the world.  The ability to teleport is indeed, a class
defining feat for Druids by many if not most legends.

Secondly, even if it WASN'T a class defining ability by most RP standards,
it IS a class defining ability by EQ Standards, and EQ is the game we're
playing in.

I bought EQ when it first hit the shelves.  I started my Druid bases SOLELY
on the descriptions of the classes.  Their ability to travel was the THE
thing they were good at according to those descriptions.  I believe their
words were "No class can go from point A to point B better than a Druid".
(from memory...)  Now, while we have other abilites that HELP us with that,
by far the linchpin of this ability is the ports.  In the beginning we were
the only class that COULD port.  After awhile they gave them to Wizzies
because they wanted more porters in the world.  When the Wizzies class
started looking very two dimensional (They couldn't do ANYTHING but nuke for
a long time), they gave the BETTER ports (TL's and Planes, neither of which
we Druids can do).

Travel is our mandate, and the ports are the largest part of that mandate.
Over the last four years I've seen the erosion and trivialization of that
mandate.  This is fine, I don't always like it, but I realize games must
change.  What I object to is not being given a REPLACEMENT mandate!

Again, it doesn't have to be earth shattering, just something to call our
own.

> Try crying on the
> shoulder of a rogue or warrior about your inability to port people
> around for money

I've been very reasonable, and willing (WANTING) to discuss and debate this.
I've insulted noone, and said many, many, many times that I'm not interested
in, nor did I ever MAKE money off my ports.  I have a Warrior at level 27,
so yes, I know a LITTLE of how they work.

So, lets leave the insulting phrases behind eh?
