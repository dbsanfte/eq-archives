I played a rogue to 40th and then got bored with her.  It was just too
difficult to play because she was so dependent on groups.  Her playability
is really limited to combat, and outside of that there is just nothing for
her to do. Perhaps at higher levels rogues are sought after, but below 40 no
one really understands their usefullness.  Rogues need to be made more
soloable (maybe if poisons were fixed) and more useful outside of combat.
Adding more traps and locks would be great.  There should be other ways
around them just as there are ways to do without gates/ports/clarity/sow,
but having a rogue would make it easier.

Now I'm playing a shaman and I love it because when there are no groups
around I still have plenty to do.  I can solo, I can explore (of course I
can explore with my rogue, but it's much easier and safer with my shaman) or
buff newbies or help out friends.  My poor rogue even sucked at tradeskills
because of low INT.

That being said, I was thinking of starting a Rouge.  Rouges are always in
great demand, especially among the pale skinned races.  :)
