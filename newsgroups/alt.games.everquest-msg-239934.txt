Ahhh. The obligatory "We are better because we use a newsreader and you
use a web browser" posts. How typical. Not a real loss tho. For a few
years now, the only thing I've found newsgroups to be good for is
downloading porn. 

If you want information, join a mailing list. If you want easy access,
join a web based forum. If you want asswit comments about how someone
is better than you, join a newsgroup. /shrug

I'm out.
