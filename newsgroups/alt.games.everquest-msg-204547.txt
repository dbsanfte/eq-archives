That too would be unrealistic.  It would be better, imo, if large
negative faction hits carried a partial permanent reduction in
your "cap" for that faction, and if small hits had a chance (say
10%) of permanently reducing your faction cap.  Various factions
could have minimum values for the cap, so that the Scumbags of
Someplace faction might well tolerate traitors (i.e. the cap would
not drop below indifferent, you could always work faction with
them enough to not be KOS and to use their vendors), while the
Paladins of Utter Propriety might have no minimum at all for their
faction cap ("Once a traitor, always a traitor.  Die scumsucker!").
