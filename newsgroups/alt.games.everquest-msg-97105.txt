Hmmm... my impression was that Freeport is where you wanted to go for Wizzy
spells at level 12, because that was the only place to find whatever that
big-guns lighning-based spell for your level is, and one of only two places
to get the resist buff spell (sorry for the ultra-technical terminology
there....).

You want to look again.  I think it may be either way upstairs, or possibly
out in the courtyard of the guild.
