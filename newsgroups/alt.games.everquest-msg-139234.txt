I think the doctors would explain why that's not technically feasible.  
You could probably arrange to have prosthetic claws and a stinger, though.  
That would really be pretty handy.  Nobody would mess with you walking 
through bad neighborhoods late at night... Admittedly, mosty because the 
obvious crazies don't usually have anything worth stealing. :)
