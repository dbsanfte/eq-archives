It will be, they are unrelated. I remember them asking about the
change you specify, but this is a more friendly version.  Note that
the npcs WILL still take "items they care about". A quest item WOULD
BE an item they care about still. This should not affect multiquesting
at all and if it did they'd certainly say, since in the earlier thread
they mentioned options and one option they mentioned WOULD stop
multiquesting.
