I played mage to 65 and shaman to 52, IMO the shaman pets I had weren't 
much worse than the mage pets in the same level range, when both classes 
were using theirs correctly.  I'll admit that if you simply sic your 
unbuffed pet on a mob, unsupported by the caster in any way, that the 
mage pet will outperform the shaman pet.  But a shaman pet can get a set 
of mage gear and a set of shaman buffs (which for the most part 
outperform mage pet buffs) and benefit from shaman slowing and shaman 
healing, while the mage pet gets mostly inferior buffs and no slow.

I suppose with the advent of pets that zone with you, its more likely 
that your mage pet will have a full set of uber buffs on him, and with 
identical buffs the mage pet will have the edge.

HOWEVER all I'm really saying is that the shaman pet might lose but 
would at least be competitive, while the druid pet is never anything 
even close to a joke; saying that getting pets only at higher level 
means they must be similar to the druid pet overlooks the shaman pet 
model; quite useful and reasonably powerful, but you don't get one at 
all till 34.
