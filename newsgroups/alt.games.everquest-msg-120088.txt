I'm pretty sure that boosting your stat will increase your max mana
only, not your current mana.  I like the suggestion to get yourself
so thirsty and/or hungry that mana regen stops, thereby eliminating
standing mana regen so you don't care about how long it takes.  Best
also to use L1 or L4 spells with maxed skill, and maybe fizzle reducing
summoned focus item as well (and isn't there a fizzle reducing enchanter
buff too?).  Be a pain, but with the help of an enchanter (for mana
regen between tests) and some patience it could be tested.
