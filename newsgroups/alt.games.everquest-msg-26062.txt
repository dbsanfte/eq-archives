The garbage wasn't crossposted by a regular
user of news.admin.net-abuse.email, it was
part of a flood of abuse by someone(s) who
call themself(s) "HipCrime".

----- Quote from Hipcrime info post by Caveman Og -----

See the "HipCrime Information Center":

http://extra.newsguy.com/~rchason/

It's missing some information, and is probably not accurate as to the 
identity of the current "hipcrime", however, the names mentioned there
are well known in NANA*

I say "current", because "HipCrime" is used to refer not just to the 
author of "HipCrime's NewsAgent" which is being used to create the 
floods and cancels, but to the rather limited audience of users: to
wit:

Steve Boursey, in Tim Skirvin's words:

http://www.killfile.org/dungeon/why/boursy.html

John Grubor, also by Tim Skirvin:

http://www.killfile.org/dungeon/why/grubor.html

HipCrime's "argument" is the USENET cancels are "censorship", and that
anyone should be able to post anything they want, anywhere on USENET.
Needless to say, allowing that would make USENET even more of a mess 
than it already is.

I too rather doubt John Brunner would be amused.
