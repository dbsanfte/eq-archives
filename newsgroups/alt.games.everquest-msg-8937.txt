Nope, it takes longer and longer to level the higher you go.
The rate of increase of the Mobs exp is less than the rate
of increase of the experience you require to level.

Plus there are the hell levels 30,35, 40, etc. which take
twice as much as the level before and after.

I just started a new character and got him to 5th level
in one night, about 6 hours played. Not twinked and
not power-leveled. One of my other characters spent
about 2 weeks playing 4-5 hours a night to go through
level 45. Only died once and got a rez.
