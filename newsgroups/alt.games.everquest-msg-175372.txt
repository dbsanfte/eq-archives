It occurs to me that I've never seen any definitive theories on
how to interrupt casters. The following is a list of things I've
noticed both from trying to interrupt caster mobs, as well as from
being interrupted on my own.


Things That Work:

Stun: enchanters stuns and mezzes, paladin 0-length stuns, cleric nuke+stuns,
stuns from weapon procs, high level beastlord warder buff procs.

Charm: sticking charm interrupts casting. enchanter charms, bard charms.

Ducking: can't make mobs to this, but ducking will interrupt your own
spells.


Things That Kinda Work:

Bash, Slam: have a chance of interrupting spells if they connect. not sure
if Bash and Slam are special, or if it's just a side effect of moving the
target. anyone ideas?

Melee Combat: mobs are certainly able to interrupt *my* casters via melee
combat. is there anything you can do to increase chances of interrupting?
is it the hit itself (go for lower delay)? the damage (go for higher
damage)? the type of weapon (2hb better than piercing)?  is it a knockback
feature of weapons? i'm open for comments here....

Direct Damage: seems like i've been interrupted by mob nukes going
off, but not sure why. how about bardic bellowing? are bigger nukes
better than smaller for interrupting?

Horizontal Movement: enchanter nuke+knockbacks, druid nuke+knockbacks,
trying to cast spells before you've completely stopped. running doesn't
interrupt bard casting, of course, not sure if the knockback spells will.


Things That Don't Work:

Kick: never had it interrupt spells that i've seen.

DoTs: nope, doesn't interrupt spells.

Fear: is delayed until spell casting is finished, or so i've heard. Flash
of Light probably works the same way.

Vertical Movement: i haven't had many problems casting spells while sinking
in water, or drifting downward while levitating. Haven't tested this
extensively though.


There are times when keeping that caster from charming anyone is critical,
but you don't have a chanter/paladin available to Stun them into submission.
It would be nice to have a better plan than "dogpile on the Rosch Mal until
he dies".
