Ok. We've now gotten three motors. (Need only one more between two of
us.)

In case anyone else is doing these quests (these are the newbie armor
quests for gnomes, by the way) I thought I'd let you know. I've gotten
them off of regular low level runaways closer to Ak'anon twice now, and
off of the big rogue clockworks near the Mino caves once. Seems they can
drop off of any of them, but they are just an annoyingly rare drop.

Now, I need more brownie stuff to finish up the last armor pieces. In
the corner near the Mino caves we pull the *occasional* brownie, but
there's so damned few of them. I really wish I could find a spot with
more brownies, but I don't see any brownie villages or camps in
Steamfont, and we're WAY too low to try the ones in LFay.
