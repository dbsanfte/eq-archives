sigh..that war always gets bugged at grimlings,  I haven't been able to 
repop the zone..I have tried. No sense petitioning, the GM's won't repop 
it for ya, no matter how much you beg. There's supposed to be a patch 
that's been postponed twice so far, the day that patch goes in, get 
yourself to Hollowshade as fast as you can.  By far the best way to get 
the item you are looking for.

Good luck.
