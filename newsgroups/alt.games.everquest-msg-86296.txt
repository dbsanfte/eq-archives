I play a level 30 bard on The Nameless, and I can't see how you can twist
4 songs.  I can do 3 and have a tiny bit of time to spare, but 4 ... well I just
don't see how without dropping the effects of song - 3.

I almost always play three, but twist in various songs as the situation changes...

Are there songs with longer than average effect times that I'm missing?

What's the trick?

Thanks

- Corey
