Anyone who doesn't think trains don't add fun and excitement and don't 
belong in a MMORPG, should just go play Timmy the Choochoo.  Trains will 
always rule, MMORPG's that don't have them are sissy programming catering 
to carebears.  I loved DAOC for a long time, but no (lethal) trains in the 
dungeons was always weird.
