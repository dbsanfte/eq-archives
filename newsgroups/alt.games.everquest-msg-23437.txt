Actually, the Mithril Two-hander's haste is a proc. This means (as you probably
know) that it has to go off before the haste effect sets in. It IS NOT
permanent haste. And as far as I know, level 18 is too low a level to proc it.
So pretty much you ARE hitting at 40 delay, whether or not it seems like it.
Unless DO have a permanent haste item, ex. FBSS, COF, Swirlspine Belt, etc.

No it isn't. The effect: haste is...and since it's not permanent haste, it
doesn't work at level 1 (since it doesn't proc then, not sure of proc level
though).

With perma-haste (ex. FBSS) I know it remains constant, however, I'm not sure
about the mith 2hander. I would assume that it does...I think enchanter haste
doesn't remain constant though.

If you want to time something like that, do it using your log, it's much much
more accurate.
