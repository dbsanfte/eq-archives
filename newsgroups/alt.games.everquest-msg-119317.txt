Necro/Druid is a good duo, they are both twats and you can avoid two at the
same time.
Ranger/Enchanter is good as they are both big fat blokes who wear womens
clothes.
ShadowKnight/Beastlord is good cos they both suck so you dont feel so bad.
Paladin/Cleric is good becasue they are both gay and can enjoy bottom fun
together.

Shaman/Warrior clearly 0wns you though. I always like having a shammy bitch
look after me. Verant loves warriors, other classes are pointless (cept
heal/slow bitch), join with us!.


Your Evil Twin.
