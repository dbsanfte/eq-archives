EC can be "fun", as long as you are not there, in a rush and itching to get
back to adventuring/levelling...I spent time in EC because an hour on line
isn't long enough for me to group, IMO. I don't like the idea of joining a
group unless I can commit for at least 2 hours. So when I couldn't I'd
trade, which in turn paid for a sword I cannot proc for 7 levels and a pair
of Gaunts I cannot use the effect of for 2 levels (well slighty under, not
far shy of 44th)

CF
Hmmm... Fun, no. Interesting, yes :ï¿½)
