One bit of advice I haven't seen posted yet.... At level 9, you'll start
getting spellcasting skills: Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration, Divination,
and Evocation. Be sure to put at least one point into all of those *except*
Conjuration. Why? Because of all the ~150 spells available to you during
your career as a paladin, only -->3<-- require Conjuration. And they're
all fairly useless to you.
