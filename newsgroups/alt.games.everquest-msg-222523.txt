My baby bard has reached level 31 now and I have been messing around with
charm. Before I start swarm charming I plan on getting equipment to minise
the amount of multitasking I need to perform, ie:

- Iksar Cermonial Chestplate to replace Gothic Steel when Charming to
provide regen without needing to twist it.

- Journeyman's boots - will camp my bard in zone and kill the clops with the
Chimp/Gimp so I do not need to constantly twist in Selo's either.

That means I just have to worry about keeping charm in the right place and a
few well placed dot's / brusco's. My Bard has Hiding skill maxed at 55 (?)
but this is not reliable enough at this level to break charm so I was
wondering whether there are any bard usable right click invis items which I
can keep an eye out for in the bazaar?

Chimp used to have a Circlet of Shadows but that item is Necro/Shadownight
only, but a different item with the same utility would make it much easier
to not accidently lose my charmed mob due to um...  "peer group pressure"
all the time.

Cheers
