    EB is a crutch. It makes you very dependent on proc rate, and sometimes
that weapon just doesn't proc. Warriors that go for high sustained DPS,
either through weaponry or Vengeance/ATK, are more reliable at holding aggro
and building sufficient hate fast. We recently did a parse on some trial
mobs in Solusek Ro's Tower, and our warriors were right up there with the
monks and rogues for highest DPS excluding procs.

    Because we don't farm stuff as much as you do. ;-) Remember the 12
rogues? Between them is one Bloodbath and maybe three Khalshazars (sp?). Our
motto during PoP has been "3 times is enophe" (spelling mistake is an inside
joke) - once we've killed a mob three times, we don't want to go back and do
it again. I think that at times that policy is shortsighted, but we're still
in the lead on the server and that's what counts. The only way it hurts us
is when guilds below us get strats handed to them by friends on other
servers, or by hacking into our web board (happened once) - then they get
the benefit of gearing up, and don't have to do the work we do to learn an
encounter.
