Well, it *seems*  (and I really  hate having to use one of these "it
seems" arguments, they're inherently dishonest) that the taunt rate
for Disease Cloud has been cut dramatically.  Usually a few casts of
disease cloud can keep damned near anything outside of high reds onto
my SK, preventing the healers and rogues from getting beat up.  Either
that druid was casting CH on me, or the 24th level rogue was using a
Ragebringer, but I simply could not pull stuff off my party at times.

Course, could just be a one time thing, a bad night with the random
number generator.
