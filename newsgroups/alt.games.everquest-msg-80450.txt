Str affects rogue damage minimally.  Str affects ATK.  ATK is a major factor
in BS damage, but Str doesn't make or break it.  I wouldn't recommend anyone
give up much in the way of AC/HP for Str.  (Not saying you were saying that,
just opining)

AFAIK, there are no 2HP weapons that we rogues can use.

Usually.  That's a little too simplistic, though.  I wouldn't put a 2 / 17
weapon mainhand when I've got a 10/29 option instead.  One must get in the
habit of weighing DPS vs. pure speed.  Offhand, though, should *always* be
based on ratio of damage.  In offhand, a 10 / 20 is the same as a 11 / 22 as
a 12 / 24....   And, just for the record, there is NO connection between
when mainhand strikes and offhand (old rumours still fly).
