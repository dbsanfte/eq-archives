Which server are you on? Someone can no doubt help you.

If all else fails you could go to the plane of knowledge and get a list
of high level necros who don't seem to busy and politely ask them if
they have a few minutes to spare to help you find your corpse.

Most people are lazy and unhelpful but you'll find someone willing to help.
