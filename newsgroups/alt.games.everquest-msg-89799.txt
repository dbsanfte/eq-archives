Here's what I remember about Kurn's:

It's very easy to single pull skellies, since they don't help each
other and they have pretty small aggro ranges; the only times I ever
had adds was if I was fighting one and another one happened to be
walking by and got too close to me.  If you pull them with a shuriken
rather than go right up to them and hit them, they'll often do this
kind of "loop de loop" run around the room before they go after you.  

When you first enter Kurn's, you'll see a "lobby" and an entryway
usually guarded by two skeletons, then there is the "main room" where
various skeletons wander around.  There are also smaller rooms off to
the sides in the main room that have a couple of skeletons inside.
There are stairs leading to the upper levels and to the basement off
the main room. There is also a secret "safe room" in the northeast
corner of the main room, at about pos 200, neg 100, I think, where
mobs won't enter.  

Usually I would pull the mobs to one of the corners in the "lobby" and
fight them there, or else go in one of the smaller rooms and fight
inside there.  

The main floor has mostly scalebone skeletons and greater skeletons,
plus some greater scalebones (note:  If you see a greater scalebone
with a piercer, I would add a con level to it, i.e., if a greater
scalebone with a piercer is even to you, it's really more like a
yellow, because they hit quite hard with the piercers).  You can
probably stay on the main floor till about 15 or 16, when it will
start greening out, then you can move to the upper floors.

The second through fourth levels have more greater skeletons and
greater scalebones, plus higher level skeletons like lesser icebones
and lesser charbones, plus an undead crusader which drops a skull for
an Iksar shaman cudgel quest, and also "an odd mole", which drops an
item for an Iksar warrior quest armor piece (but I think he is in the
mid to upper 20's level, so you'll definitely want to wait for a while
on him!).

The basement has furbies (burynai) and many of them are spellcasters
(necros, SKs, shamans) so you'll probably want to wait till at least
your high teens/20s to go in the basement unless you have a good
group.  The basement also has some other unique mobs like fingered
skeletons, which Iksar monks need their fingers for one of their
shackle quests, plus the Undead Jester, which sometimes drops the
Iksar Berzerker Club so you'll see high level players camping him.  (I
think Soloist's Icy Wand also drops in Kurn's as a rare drop).

Also, the skeletons in Kurn's sometimes drop Burynai hide armor and
seem to have more cash on them than the skeletons outside.  There is
also an experience bonus because it's an indoor dungeon.  There
usually aren't very many trains here, and most of the time they will
come from the furbies in the basement, and I've usually managed to
stay safe by staying in the corners (or the small rooms) as the train
goes by.  I find Kurn's to be much safer than the Pit in Field of
Bone, where you have lots of aggro mobs like Iksar outlaws, furbies
and scaled wolves to watch out for (plus the fact that the skeletons
in Field of Bone DO help each other); Kurn's is one of my favorite
zones.

Another note, in case you weren't already aware:  In Field of Bone,
don't train the furbies to the guards because the guards won't kill
them!  They then wind up running around slaughtering the newbies until
they either wander back into the Pit or another player kills them!  

Hope some of this helps, and sorry for such a long post!
