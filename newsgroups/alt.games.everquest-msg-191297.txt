2 things,

1. At level 20th you get to have a choose a real surname, so your name would
then be <name> <surname> rather than both together, best to name your
character with this in mind. This should made apparent on character creation
screen, IMO.

2. Think of a new and appropriate RP name for your character because (with
any luck) a GM/Guide with any knowledge of sports (in particular,
Basketball) will force a name change.

Allow me to direct you to :-

and a little quote from above link.

5. Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be either
fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth Brooks,
Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan).
