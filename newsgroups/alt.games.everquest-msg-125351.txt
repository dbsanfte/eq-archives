I've been playing a bard with my friend's monk and find that a
very nice combination thus far.

While the combination is weak in heals, it does have decent
HP regen, slows, hastes, snares, mez, charm, single pulling,
good damage output (bard better melee damage than priest
classes, and of course monk arguably best melee damage in
the game)

We both have Bind Wounds, which means the first 50% of
our damage comes off very quickly (stack bandaging on
top or strings healsong, which can be played while we work)

Bards come with an incredible bag of tricks that compliment
the monk's very nicely.  While its true that you can find
better heals (priest classes) better tracking (druids and
rangers) better slows and hastes (shaman and chanters... although
bard slow and haste stack with those two if you aren't limited to
a duo) better mez (chanter.. but not necro, which is another mez
class but not as good as bard) and better melee (bard worst of
all the melee classes to 50) in a duo you will appreciate having
all those capabilities together in one package... and appreciate
even more that none of them involve sitting around medding
up mana.

Another combo I think might be very interesting is the other
side of the classic monk/shaman... how about bard/shaman?

Since bard haste/slow stacks with shaman, you should get
blinding speed out of the melee end, and an incredibly slow
mob to work on relative to its level.  Shaman are also the
best of the priest classes when it comes to melee, and eventually
get a pet.  While there will be some downtime with this
combo, as the shaman will need some medding, it won't be
bad since the bard can manasong and do cantana of soothing,
which will stack mana, more mana, and HP regen for the
shaman who is merrily cannabalizing away with his own
regen on.  If you prefer root/rot, the bard can pump mana
and HP (read mo mana) while dancing in to land his
own DOTs to stack on top, and also provide a snare
for mobs breaking root.  The shaman can provide SoW,
which is superior to Selo's for day to day work, and the
bard can Selos' for blindingly fast travel across zones or
for long pulls.
