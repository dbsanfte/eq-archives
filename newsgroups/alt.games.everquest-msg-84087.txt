They don't though. People have had cazic in fear or other mobs in fear
stolen out from under them and the GMS have done nothing. Verant has
the same PNP for planes or raids as they do for smaller mobs, unless
GMS vary pretty widely in their decisions. I think at one time GMS did
vary a lot which is why verant made a lot more rules, since that was a
large customer complaint (totally unequal treatment just based upon
what server you were on or what GM you happened to get at the time in
a customer subscription based game which is supposed to have equal
treatment for all subscribers)

They can.

Actually it does happen, a lot. We had this happen with ragefire. We
had a sufficient force to clear the firegiants and have our cleric in
place to make the turn in. AFTER we are set up THEN this other guild
with fewer people and a cleric ALSO wanting ragefire comes in and she
poses to turn it in also. We did not even bother petitioning because
we've had this same thing happen before and know verant's policy. She
turned in first so according to verant she gets the kill, we knew that
and politely left (but not before some of our people got killed after
they got owned, of course) They did not have a sufficiently strong
force for the dragon and we knew it and they knew it, they were just
very very selfish (well, mainly their cleric was) Later, they got
another large guild to come and help them kill it since we sure as
heck were not going to. The other large guild later apologized to us
for helping since in a way they aided the smaller guild in screwing
us. I don't know about other servers, but on ours this really doesn't
make a dent in the ability of even that cleric to get groups. Stuff
like that just happens.

That event in particular was a reason why I sent off another long
letter to verant complaining of the difficulty in and liklihood of
things like that to happen in the cleric ragefire part of their epic.
Evidently over time enough people have sent in similar letters that
verant finally changed it.

So its kind of like you said, there is nothing wrong if they went in
there and got it (except for their reputations) but what they did to
you breaks a major rule of the PNP which is that you can't cause the
death or xp loss of other customers. I'm amazed you got a GM response
so fast though and that anything so major was done so rapidly, you
must have got a "hanging" Gm.
