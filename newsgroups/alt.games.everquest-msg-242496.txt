  Someone lends/rents you their grandmaster trophy in the bazaar.  You right
click it, give it back, and admire your new no-rent grandmaster bag.  When that
gets old, you take the no rent bag to the gnome on the second story balcony of
the trader's building between the banks.  I forget his name, but talk to him
first and he's say stuff to let you know he's the guy.  Give him the no rent bag
and whammo!  You get the permanent version.  It's a Good Thing.

   And yes, there are tokens for bags for sell also.  You have to give a weight
reduction bag to the barbarian chick who stands in front of the building the
gnome is in.  Give her a token, and she gives you (or someone else with your
token) your bag back.  I believe though, that if you giver her a no-drop bag you
get a no-drop token.

   This is good.  The more snare capable classes there are, the better.  /bow
