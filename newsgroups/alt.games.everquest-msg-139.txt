standing in the same spot or sitting under water will not raise your
swimming skill, i know this for when on a kedge keep raid as a caster you
swimming will not go up much at all, but if you are on a kedge raid and are
pulling as the monk your skill will increase much much more.   therefore the
sitting intervals while meding as a caster your skill is not going up. but??
auto running into a wall might work, just an idea.
