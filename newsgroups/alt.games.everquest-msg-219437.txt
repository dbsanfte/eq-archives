Agreed, even though I haven't spent all that much time in LDoN (only
about 15 missions).

I disagree, I haven't found the slaughter missions to be any easier
than an assassinate or rescue. I can think of a lot of potential
groups (mainly lower DPS) that have an easier time with the latter two
than with a slaughter mission.

Yup, count me as one of those that avoids collection missions. It's
too easy to get screwed by the RNG or just loose some corpses in
walls.

These are actually my favorites. I like the uncertainly of not knowing
how tough the boss mob will be and even the toughtest ones (cleric
mobs) aren't unbeatable imo.

Gawd no! It's bad enough already that you need 30 wins  in each to
unlock everything. It's actually pretty balance from what I've seen,
if you look past the best armors for each class there's actually a
pretty nice spread of items out there for everyone (or at least
casters, dunno how pure melees make out).  Certain themes have the
better augments, certain themes have the best non-class specific items
(weapons, masks, belts, etc.). ... and hell, even at 65 there's one or
two items out there where the 3rd tier armor would be an upgrade for
me.

There's a saying, "if you loan a friend $20 and you never see them
again, it was probably worth the $20". I tend to look at looting in
LDoN that same way, At least on normal difficulty levels, the loot
just isn't that great, if someone goes LD with the loot and doesn't
come back, if someone insists on rolling on augments that they really
don't have much use for, I consider it a small price to pay for
finding out who the idiots and loot whores are. There just aren't many
drops in LDoN that are worth more than 3 or 4k, even on a 65 normal
adventure. I can think of an ID4 belt and that 1hb in Everfrost
(before it was nerfed last patch). Anyone willing to trash his rep for
that kind of money is more than welcome to.

Yeah, it's sad that there are a lot of relatively easy (from a
programming standpoint) things that they could've done to spice things
up a bit. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now
and put it down to lack of time getting out a new expansion and not
lack of imagination. I'll give them a couple of months to spice things
up a bit before bitching too much about that.
