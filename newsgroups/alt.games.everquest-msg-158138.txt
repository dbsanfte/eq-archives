}Druids DID lose something.

}Right now, Ingot is the underdog.  He's being ripped to shreds

}honestly haven't found any of his posts whiney, though that does
}not stop people from accusing him of being whiney.

His points were, however, just as valid when luclin came out and those 
nexus spire thingies were added.  We already had this argument, and it 
went on for days and involved much wailing and gnashing of teeth.

Net result:  The spires stayed, and druids strangely didn't all cancel 
their accounts.  Many of them seemed to even be making -more- money from 
port whoring.  Ports got more expensve and demand didn't diminish.

There is a natural tendency, I think, for any argument that everyone's 
already sick to the teeth of on USENET to be perceived as whiny.

I say, let's postpone this argument until the novelty of the new system 
wears off and we see whether people actually stop needing ports, or if, 
impatient as usual, they still seem to need a port every 12.6 seconds.

(Hmm... I can take the spire to DL, then run to BW, then all the way 
across to Chardok, or zone to PoK and go to either FV or the Outpost...  
Screw it.)

/ooc anyone porting to Skyfire?
