Yes he does. 

They are referred to as halflings in LoTR. More
than once.

"Are not these the Halflings, that some among us
call the Holbytlan?"
(The Road to Isengard, The Lord of the Rings)

"'Hobbits?' said ï¿½omer. "And what may they be? It
is a strange name."
""A strange name for a strange folk," said Gimli.
"But these were very dear to us. It seems that you
have heard in Rohan of the words that troubled
Minas Tirith. They spoke of the Halfling. These
hobbits are Halflings.""
(The Riders of Rohan, The Two Towers)
 
When Pippin goes to Minas Tirith, one of the names
he is known by is "Prince of the Halflings".

Similar, but not quite the same. Halfling and
Hobbit are used interchangeably by Tolkien.
