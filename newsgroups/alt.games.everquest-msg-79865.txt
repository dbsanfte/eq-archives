I've been there a couple of times already. It was camped and the
people there had already spent hours. There was also a list of people
waiting for the camp. From my observations it is shaping up to be an
"insanely long camp".

See above.

There is nothing in LG that my normal group is interested in. There
much better drops in Kunark, Velious, and SoL. All of the LG drops
(which are perma-camped) can be purchased in EC at fire-sale prices. 

I will be heading back when I hit 45. Right now I can make great exp
and cash in Crystal Caverns. With a bank and vendors in the same zone
it is a monk paradise.

Cheers
