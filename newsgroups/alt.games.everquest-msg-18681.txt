You could probably get a Dagger of Dropping really cheaply, especially
if you hang out near Paw, where they are considered trash loot and
generally go to vendors.

The lambent stones from things like Hill Giants and Griffons are LORE,
so people can't loot more than one. Consequently, many are left to rot
on corpses so if you can run around the Rathe Mountains for a bit
without getting ganked by said Hill Giants, you will probably find one
for free sooner or later. Then just turn it in to the right NPC in the
temple of Sol Ro for a darkwood staff.

Then there's always velium weapons - I assume there's a Velium version
of the dagger, and velium weapons go for 10pp or so *if* you can find
someone who has bothered to cart the things back to the old world to
sell them rather than just dump 'em on vendors. Maybe sidle up to a
friendly higher-level player and ask them if they'd mind bringing you
back a souvenir next time they're hunting in Velious...
