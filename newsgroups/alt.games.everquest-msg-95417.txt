If you have a pet class caster and you play in full screen mode with
the chat window with a dark background then this tip is for you:

Most of the text message colors can be changed in the eqclient.ini
file. However, I have never found a way to change the text of the
"/pet report health" command. This line always seems to be dark blue
which is difficult to read on a dark background. I like having all the text
a light color on a dark background, but this makes this particular command
hard to read of course. This command is extremely vital when hunting
with a pet because the only alternative is to actually target the pet which
can waste time and worse make you mistarget a spell.

So to solve this problem I made a hot key to switch the back ground
temporarily to a lighter color for this command, like so:

/wincolor chat 255 255 255 3
/pet report health
/pause 10
/wincolor chat 0 0 0 3

Works great. Play with the colors and pause time to suit your needs.
Just wish I had thought of it a long time ago. 'Thinking' that you see 84%
health when its really 34% is a huge difference. =)

Hopefully the new interface will make all these kludge tricks a thing
of the past.
