If you can get a good group of people together (tends not to work with
pickup groups), there are some pretty good 'crawl' dungeons out there
for higher level people. Chardok (A and B), Siren's Grotto, SolC,
Dragon Necropolis and Hates Fury come to mind. Howling Stones ahd the
Hole probably, but I haven't been thre since the last revamp so I'm
not sure what has changed. The main problem is that in most of those,
the ability to summon corpses is almost a requirement if you wipe deep
in. Hate's Fury is the exception since it has a graveyard.
