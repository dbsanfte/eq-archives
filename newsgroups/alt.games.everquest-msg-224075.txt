    Ah!  Incoming undeserved compliment!  Hide, HIDE!

  It would be much better to follow Monual, because he's ubar and can twink much
better than I ever could.

   I haven't been on the FV community board for a couple of days, but I would
imagine that there is great celebration over this omission.  For some reason
there seems to be quite a bit of concern that "foreign" gear doesn't end up on
the server.  I imagine this has something to do with  high end stuff losing the
"no drop" tag when it shows up (at least, when I link stuff in the AGE channel,
others see it as no-drop while the like looks like a droppable item to me).  I
guess they are a bit nervous that the lack of no drop gear and low server
population might attract elemental riff raff from other, lesser servers (present
company excepted, of course).

   True.  And people from other servers can befriend each other via various
class boards as well.

    I don't have any friends, so this is rarely a problem.  I did know a couple
of people at my last real job who played.  I liked them well enough, but I don't
think we would have meshed in game.  One guy was shocked when he learned that I
wasn't interested in becoming ubar.  "What?  But I have a full suit of right
clicky armor!?  What could be more fun than THAT???"  Just

   I've said this in the AGE channel before, but here it is again.  What I want
is a "Universe Portal" in say, Freeport or some where accessible where one
clicks on the stone, and gets a list of servers one could pick from.  You click,
you go.  You click again, you come back.
