Still haven't made that laptop purchase... came close today, when I got 
some advice that made me leary.

I'm really stuck going with low end machines, buying 4 on a fairly tight 
budget.  I found what looked like a good deal and was setting it up, 
getting Compaq notebooks direct from the company, from a base of $399... 
but the guy I talked to at Compaq was seriously trying to upsell me into 
a better processor, claiming that neither a Celeron nor Sempron would be 
able to run Everquest or Neverwinter Nights; I'd need at least an AMD 
Turion64.  Suddenly we're up to 586.99, PLUS it turns out there's an 
extra $50 for shipping, for each machine!  We've ventured out of my 
price range at this point for four machines; I've got to get the total 
expenditure down under $2k or my wife faction is going to go to KOS.

When I asked about the whole laptop question here earlier, consensus was 
that modern laptops would do fine, I might have to turn down the 
graphics, but I'm already doing that on my 4 year old desktop...

Do Celeron or Sempron machines not qualify as "modern" or was this 
Compaq salesguy just trying to spring more commission out of me?
