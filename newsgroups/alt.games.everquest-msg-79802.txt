I read somewhere that the amount of weight a Monk carries directly affects his
damage output, and it was ommended the ideal carry weight for said Monk was
around 13 pounds. This seems obscene. The Monk would need a mule to carry his
food and loot were this the case. No?

Comments please.

Thanks in advance.

David
