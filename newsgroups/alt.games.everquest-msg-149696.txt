It may be easier to only have to worry about one person, but get used to
having to heal several, especially in groups where you are the only healer.
Other classes will occasionally get aggro.  For example, a caster might root
an add, and if root wears off before the rest of the group gets around to
fighting that add, it is going to go for the caster, and while the caster is
getting it rerooted, the caster is likely getting hit.

Cleric, in pretty much every MMORPG, not just EQ, is a pretty hectic class
to play, so if you want to just concentrate on one thing, it may not be the
class for you.  Crowd control is the other majorly hectic task.  For a real
hectic time, try a Midgard Healer in DAoC--that class is both Midgard's
primary healing class *AND* primary crowd control class. :-)
