You can get a 30 day free trial but you do have to give them credit card info 
first.  Don't worry though because it does not charge you until after the 30 
days.  A free cd key can be gotten from here -

Don't worry about it saying Europa on the page.  I used this for my free key 
and in fact I'm on my 3rd month of playing EQ with only this key.
