Research components can drop in ANY zone from critters appropriate for the
spell level up to 5 levels above.

What I mean is, for your Color Shift spell (20), kill lots of stuff in zones
where levels 20-25 hunt.  But, quite honestly, I got most of mine from
farming vendors every chance I got.  I had a list of Research Only pages to
keep my eye out for, no matter what level, until I successfully combined it.

I'd recommend auctioning for 10p per page number that you want...that might
help some, too.

BTW, you SHOULD be able to find all 34-44 Research Only spells for sale in
Katta, in the square building with 4 round corners.  Click on the tapestry
inside to go up to the next floor (I think it's on the 3rd floor).
