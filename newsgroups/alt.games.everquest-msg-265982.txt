The time investment doesn't need to be in camp time.

So the problem is the rare spawn, not the non-instancing. I think I
mentioned elsewhere that your issue was in fact with the spawning, not
the zone.

You are confusing the time it takes to do the quest with the time it
takes someone to be out of the way for you to do the *final spawn*.
These are not the same things. You try boiling it down that far and
every mmorpg is "push button convenient", which is obviously not true.

This is quite possible in EQ as it is today and always has been. It
didn't happen. Obviously its not as big a threat as you would have
everyone believe. This "oh noes people will zeeeeerg it and thats
wrooooong!" paranoia is baseless, not to mention even if people do,
there's nothing *wrong* with it.

Is EQ trivialized to the endgame just because a guild could farm for
equipment in zones ten levels higher than its playerbase with enough
people?

A product of mudflation, not an inherent flaw with non-instancing.
Given enough time GoD trials will be trivial too just like Nagafen.
Sure they could beef up the trials. They could beef up Nagafen too.
