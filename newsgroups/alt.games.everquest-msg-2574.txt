Grouping with a good tank is great at lower levels, when the damage shield
does a respectable amount of damage. This doesnt work at higher levels.
At high levels I like to group with a necro. The necro dots work well with
root kiting, the pet is great for finishing off "fleeing" mobs, and you can
cast regen/chloro on the necro and have more mana to toss around (using
their hp to mana convert spell line).
Not so sure about indoors, I suppose the pet could tank a bit. Unless the
dungeon is green, I prefer to avoid indoor areas completely as a druid.
