Another big change, also from eqcasters:

"Chat channels have now been added to the test server.  This long
awaited ability is excellent for improving group communication on
raids without spamming zones or guild chat.

These channels can be password protected when creating the channel.
They are used with the following commands (test only currently):

    * /join : (e.g: /join casters:seekrit)
    * /chat (text)
    * /leave

This is most likely part of the new updates being released to
EverQuest over the next week."

Sometimes you have to wonder just how big an obstacle the Verant
people who left the company really were....
