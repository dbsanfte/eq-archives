You must not be very good at reading, since I had no trouble finding
negative reports from beta testers.  I even saw one that said AO was more
stable at the comparable stage of beta.

Neocron looks like it might be pretty interesting, but you don't help it by
coming to various forums and blatantly lying about it (or about the games
you play...I doubt you play EQ or DAoC) (yes, he posted the identical long
message in a.g.daoc, except the subject said he was quiting DAoC for
Neocron, intead of quiting EQ).
