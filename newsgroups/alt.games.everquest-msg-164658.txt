Thank you dr. Sisson. You my friend just made a hypocritical observation.
But, no one was talking to you and it drives you crazy. You crave attention,
so you jumped on board the train to ridicule those who jump on board the
train. LOL, moron
 So you call these self made Walter Mitty's real friends, I say, it must be
the only ones you have thus you defend them like family. Did you meet your
wife on the net too ?

LOL Figures you did.
