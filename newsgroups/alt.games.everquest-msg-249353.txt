Defining execution as appropriate punishment when the system is only 
'highly accurate' was an error. Highly accurate isn't absolute... death 
is absolute.

Forensic evidence has been faked by criminals, and misinterpreted by 
investigators countless times. Forensics, despite what you see on CSI, 
doesn't always point the right guy... at least not unless you have the 
complete picture.

CSI to its credit has reffed this... the episode where the guy is facing 
the death penalty for burning his family to death for example, where the 
CSIs are called upon by the victim to re-review forensics collected by 
another CSI. That story has a 'happy ending'... but that is incidental. 
The real epiphany is the realization of the potential for error, 
negligence, and misuse of forensic evidence.

And that was an accident when all was said and done. Don't forget that 
criminal sophistication *will* rise to the challenge of modern forensics.
