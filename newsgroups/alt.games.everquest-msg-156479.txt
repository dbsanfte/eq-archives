-OK, I finally got to see the show about EQ addicts.  I must say it
was

-The woman who's son killed himself was more pathetic than I had
imagined

Sony
-won't help her and "someone out there knows what happened" and won't
come
-forward, and she "just wants to know".  Bullshit.  They went through
his

"Iloveyou".

information than

happened.

-However, it would have been nice for them to add that the leading
cause of

about

they

relate

all day

are in

-I had to watch the show (a few days late) over the internet.  I

Been looking for the internet broadcast of the show. It is still
available? Spent Friday night in EQ and missed the first 1/2 hour till
I realized it was on... guess I shouldn't have skipped the alarm
window :)

thanks
