Yes, something very similar happened to me.  I was sitting in one of
the Nexus spires waiting for the port and was sowing or claritying
everyone in sight (forget which character).

Then I noticed I had the Spires targeted, and yes, I remember they
were scowling.  Sometimes my horse scowls at me too, so I wasn't
worried about getting attacked.  :-)

Now whenever I'm waiting at a spires I keep clicking all around but
haven't managed to get the spires targeted again.

Another odd thing about the Nexus spires is that there seems to be
an invisibile bulge in the middle of the platform.  It's as if there
is someone invisible sitting there because you sort of bob up when
you walk over the middle of the platform.  See Invisible doesn't
show anything new.  Anyone else notice that?
