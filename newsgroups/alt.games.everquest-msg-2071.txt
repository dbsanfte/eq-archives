Nothing in Toxx Forest is aggressive, so that won't be a probem.  The
entryway to Paineel is guarded by a couple of skels that aren't aggressive,
either.  Once in Paineel, the guard skels will be either threatening or
scowling, but they have very low aggro ranges and you can get past w/o
difficulty.  Then there's the new NPC, Azzar Habbib,  he is what leads to
the littering of bodies from the newbie garden entry to the Warrens zone.
He's like Mikey, he hates everyone (except Erudites from Paineel and
followers of Cazic, I think).
