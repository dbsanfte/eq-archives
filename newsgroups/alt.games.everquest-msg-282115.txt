Fright and Dread death touch, Terror does not.

I know with mudflation out of control when I left, and two expansions since
then, Fear is probably much, much, easier than when I went. (Not since Luclin
was the newest expansion.)   but I still have a hard time believing the group
described can do it.   A low level warrior and two healers no crowd control or
dps.   Unless you're going to have the druid DPS, but that leaves only a
shaman healing.  None of them max level...
