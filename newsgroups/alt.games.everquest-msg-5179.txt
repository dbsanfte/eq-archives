What class are you?  The key to raising defense is to be the one 
getting hit.  My wairrior's defense maxes quickly every level no 
matter what I'm fighting.  I'm generally the one getting hit.  You say 
you are getting hit a lot but thats kind of relative.  If my enchanter 
gets hit twice, that's a lot. :-)
