There are haste caps by levels listed here:

http://cloud.prohosting.com/~talone/HasteData.htm
 
I've found that information to be roughly in line with what my parses

to find out how much damage I do.

Well, the only thing I can offer here is that my lvl 12 Paladin with a 
Mithril 2HS sees minimal haste (not 31% for sure) benefit which could 
support the theory.
