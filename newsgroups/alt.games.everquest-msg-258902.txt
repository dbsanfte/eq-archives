Yep, oddly the level of your target is completely irrelevant for archery 
skill ups.

BUT the easiest way to get archery skill ups is to find someone fighting 
mobs somewhat higher level than yourself, and getting permission to 
stand off in the distance and shoot at their mobs.  Assuming you won't 
be doing over half the damage needed to kill a mob that's higher level 
than yourself, you won't be taking any exp, and its also unlikely you'll 
get aggro.

The important thing to do, though is to make really really sure you 
aren't attacking mezzed mobs.

Oh, and since your damage output is irrelevant, what you want are really 
cheap arrows, and the fastest bow you can find (more shots per hour this 
way)

Haste Gear and a Haste Buff will help too

And get your.. Dex I think.. as high as you can.
