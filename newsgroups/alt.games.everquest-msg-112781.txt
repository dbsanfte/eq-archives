The only gear I switch is my weapon. Depending on what skill matches the
class's epic weapon, I cap that first, then rotate. For example, on my
Paladin, I cap 2HS first, then 1HS + Bash, then Piercing, then 2HB. I
have yet to obtain a 1HB worthy of use, although a 5 wep rotation might
be rather difficult to keep all skill capped until several of the others
reach their pre lvl 50 max, which ideally will occur at level 39.

I would also appreciate comments on the above strategy as I have only
been playing since December and am far, far from being even a good
player let alone an expert.....
