Which doesn't have anything to do with your amazement that he might run 
(gasp) four whole songs.

Another thought; snaring = slowing.  One of my favorite things about 
bards is that the single target snare and single target snare are both 
the same song; while the mob is beating on you he's slowed, and when he 
turns to run, hey, he's already snared and has been all along.

Self hasting is in most situations one of the least important things a 
bard can do; yes, his self haste is better than his group haste, and 
there's a good chance its better than cast haste if you have a haster in 
group.  But it only works on the bard.  And frankly, for the most part, 
the bard's melee output is an "also ran" consideration, much like that 
of the SK.

Increasing DOT and DD damage are high end songs, not at all a concern on 
Combine, nor for that matter for any sub 61 bard as far as I remember, 
no matter what expansions you might have.

DOTting is generally something you do when you can't think of anything 
more productive to do, in fact the best reason to do it is to lower the 
corresponding resist if you're grouped with people who benefit from that.

Mezzing is the bane of the bard as far as helping the group goes; each 
extra mob in camp reduces the buffs you can sing by at least one (more 
if you're not really good at switching targets on the fly) and more than 
one mob mezzed makes produing any melee dps difficult as well.

You don't mention one of the best DPS methods a bard has to offer, 
either, which is to say charm; very often a mob from the area will do 
better DPS than anything else a bard can offer, and yet the bard can 
also punch up a full array of other songs much of the time, dropping 
only on charm breaks.  If anyone really wants to see bard as DPS they 
really have to consider charm.  Run off and leave a charmed mob in camp 
though, and there's a good chance he'll break charm and if you're far 
enough away, decide to start chewing on the group instead.

I'm not saying they are critical, I'm saying they may well be of more 
benefit to the group than someone else's contribution.  Say, for example 
(and by the way, the subject of the discussion) an SK in the group who 
isn't the MT.  Whats lost when I run off to pull?  Marginal DPS, some of 
which actually stays (my pet) and backup/offtank capacity... only I 
wouldn't run off if there looked like any need for either.

To put it your way, whats better, bard DPS plus all melee hasted and all 
casters mana regen and so on, or SK DPS with the haste gone and the mana 
regen gone (If you want anything impressive out of an SK he needs mana 
regen)

Are pet pulls done at long range?  How does that work, when even in 
direct line of sight I've often told my pet to attack something, to hear 
it agree to do so and just stand there until I get closer to the mob?

I made stalking probes for a warrior friend who grouped a lot with his 
cleric wife, they'd use them on runs thru LDoN's, to check the layout 
and mob placement on tricky rooms.  They were easy to make, and cheap, 
and because each held five slots, not terribly space hoggish; they'd 
usually only go thru one or perhaps two on a run.

Casting Eye of Zomm off my mage's clay braclet, I didn't have to be 
conservative with them at all, but I found them to have a decent range 
and would use them to check all the way out to the end of side tracks on 
LDoN's to see if there were any named down there
