I haven't reached a high enough level for serious item camping.  My idea of
camping is to collect spider silk.  But, the best stroke of luck I've ever
had in terms of gear was the time my L14 paladin saw a shout from a stranger
about a weapon the stranger was giving away at the Halas ramp.  My paladin
was about a twenty second run from the ramp at the time, so I hustled right
over.  Some big guy sitting between the guards dumped a Giant Militia
Longsword on me, free of charge.  I know you people with really big
characters are thinking "whoopty fucking doo" but, as I said, I was 14th
level at the time, and that thing totally smoked the plain ol' Bastard Sword
I'd been using.  Made me a happy camper (pun intended) for some time
afterwards.

I think "fit of pique" is the proper term.  At least, that's the way I've
heard it used.  It is appropriate to describe temporary rages.  As for the
other question, I don't know, the kind that sucks his thumb when he thinks
no one's watching?  How many varieties of infantile child are there, anyway?
