It's hard to see how kids in school are an original work of authorship
until you include the whole picture, such as the name of the school
(Hogwart's) and the kids (Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, etc). Just
looking at one item in a whole work isn't enough. The platinum pieces
are solidly integrated into a whole work, thus they are a part of that
work. Your argument is like saying pixels can't be copyrighted, so a
CGI image isn't a copyrighted work.
