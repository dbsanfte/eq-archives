I am a newbie (both my character and to the game in general) who had no
business being in the Karanas with another newbie (both level 5) and of
course we died (many times I may add).  A nice Shaman gave us SoW when we
really needed it.  Of course I thanked him, but when I came across him this
evening, I thanked him again and told him how much he helped me out (it was
after a twelve hour session that he helped, I wanted to stop playing but
wanted my corpse back even more I guess)
For my kind words, I guess, I was buffed like never before.  It is amazing
how far a little kindness can get you, even in Norrath.  It is good to know
(from a newbie point of view) that not everyone who is high level will train
a cyclops to you in S. Karana (which killed me with but one blow)
