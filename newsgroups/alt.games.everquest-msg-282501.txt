Well I would not be expecting anyone who directly used it to step
forward :) But you may have a point.

I have seen the AA vendors in a previous beta though, but it was spawned
specifically by a GM for us to purchase and test specific AAs. It's a
vendor with a single item, a book (or something like that), you buy the
book cheap, hand it back to the vendor and you get an AA point, much like
melee tomes work. Given that there are supposedly no new AAs in this
next expansion, I don't know why they would have an AA vendor loaded
into the PoK zone (of course they could have included all these vendors
from a previous beta, who can tell).
