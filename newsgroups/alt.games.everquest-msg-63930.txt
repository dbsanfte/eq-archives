  It's under your Options under "Chat" I believe.

  Not that it will make much of a difference when it comes to your overall
performance in terms of graphics/frame rates.  I'm not sure if the
Options/Chat filter works on the client side or the server side.  If it's on
the server side, then it may cut down a bit on your Internet lag, but if
it's client side, you will probably see no difference whatsoever when it
comes to the speed of your machine or Internet connection.

  According to the manual there's a /serverfilter on command that you can
use, but I'm unclear on precisely what it filters.
