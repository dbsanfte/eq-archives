One of the following is what is going on:
1) He bought an account with a 30+ warrior, asked some questions, and found
out how flamish the responses are to an account buyer, and thrives on
getting responses
2) He's played EQ for a while and is just making shit up to get responses
3) He's never played EQ, but is so bored with the roller coaster groups, he
has read up on EQ in the NG archives and asks questions based on that
knowledge

No matter which it is, he's laughing his ass off anytime someone takes him
seriously because someone else was duped into believing that he really cares
what the answers to his posts are.  He doesn't care, he just wants people to
reply.  This isn't the only NG that he does this in, as a quick search
shows.  He also has a better command of grammar then he tries to let on - he
purposely doesn't use caps and leaves out apostrophes on contractions.
 He -used- to capitalize the first word of his paragraphs, and even most of
his sentences, but has forgotten that he did that in the past, and has
slipped into not doing it, now.  A good troll would be more consistant.

Even if he weren't a troll ( which he is, 100% ), I wouldn't waste time
replying to someone who can't take the time to at least try to use proper
capitalization or punctuation.  If you want intelligent replies, then don't
act like a 5-year old.  He ranks up there with "sow plz!" people, but he's
worse, because he's actually intelligent, and TRYING to look stupid.

There will -never- be a serious post from this guy, and why you anyone would
reply directly to one of his posts, with answers to his queries, is beyond
me.
