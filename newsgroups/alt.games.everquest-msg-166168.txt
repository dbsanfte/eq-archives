A nice thing you can do with coordinates is calculate where something is.
E.g., use locate corpse, then check your /loc, then run a couple seconds in
the direction of the corpse, and do another /loc.  Turn 90 degrees, and run
a few seconds.  Do another locate corpse, and another /loc.  Run toward the
corpse a few seconds, and do a 4th locate corpse.

You've now got two lines that intersect at the corpse.  Plot them on a map,
or whip out your calculator and calculate where they intersect.  There used
to be a web site, whose URL I don't have, that would let you enter the 4
/locs and it would tell you where the lines intersected.
