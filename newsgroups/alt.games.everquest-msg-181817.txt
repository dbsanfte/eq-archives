WIS determines base mana for Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Paladin, Ranger, and
Beastlord.

INT determines base mana for Enchanter, Necromancer, Wizard, Magician,
and Shadowknight.


For both all of the above the accepted formula for a stat <= 200 is:
((stat / 5) + 2) * level
For a stat > 200:
(((200 / 5) + 2) * level) + ((stat - 200) * 5.8)

This may change for levels 61 thru 65.

Also, I have seen it claimed that the 5.8 multiplier in the second
formula is an average of the actual multipliers for differing stat
values (i.e. 201 thru 210 uses one multiplier, 211 thru 220 uses
another, and so on, or something along those lines), but I don't have
any idea how true that is.  I have tested the first formula with a few
characters and it is either correct or so close it doesn't matter.
