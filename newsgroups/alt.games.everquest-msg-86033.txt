You're getting 3 things mixed up here.

Damage Shields are Druid/Mage/Wizard spells that do damage to whatever hits
you every time it hits you.

Runes are Enchanter spells that use a gem and give you an X HP ablative
shield that absorbs X damage instead of you and then its gone

Symbol is a Cleric/Paladin spell that uses a gem and is a straight bonus to
max HP.

Rune's are especially useful to keep your robe classes alive since it keeps
them from getting damaged if they manage to draw agro.  Also useful against
lifetapping creatures (EG Venril Sathir) since it absorbs the damage without
giving life.
