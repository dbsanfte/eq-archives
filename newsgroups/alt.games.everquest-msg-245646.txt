It seems like everyone is still confused about this, so let me take a crack
at clarifying.

1) HP regen now scales better from 1 to 65.  Previously natural regen did
not increase until level 51.  Now it increases every 10 levels.

2) For every minute you are sitting, you will see an increase in the amount
per tick you are regenning.  I.E. The longer you sit, the more you're
regenning per tick.

3) You can now bandage up to 70% inherently.  The only different for having
200+ skill is the amount of HP healed per bandage now.  The AA will still
increase the maximum amount you can bandage to.

4) You can now bandage while you are sitting and therefore reap the benefits
of both sitting regen and bandaging at the same time.

5) Races that have an inherent bonus to regen will maintain an advantage
over those that do not.  Their natural regen will remain greater then other
races, and they will receive a secondary % based bonus to the bonus for each
minute they are sitting.

6) You will not receive the increased regen/minute resting while you are
under the effects of a DoT, including the lich line.



This in no way represents a completion, or even an attempt, at rebalancing
melee in the high end game.  This is a direct attempt at reducing the
downtime associated with low and mid level melee characters that are
complete dependant on their HP as a limiting factor.  Casters, via the
meditate skill, already receive an increase mana regen over their level
progression, we're simply providing melee with a bonus to counter balance
this somewhat.

Especially at mid levels are subject to extreme amounts of downtime in a
situation where they do not have outside healing available.  It is our hope
that these changes will drastically decrease the downtime of melee
characters at those levels when they are unable to find a group with a
healer, and allow them an opportunity to gain exp at a rate closer to that
which casters are already able to.



I hope this clears up some of the confusion, and gives a better idea of what
we hope to accomplish with these changes.


As always, your continued feedback is welcome, and appreciated.

I hope these go live soon, particularly the bandaging changes.  I have a
15th level bard I'm leveling without being PL'ed (man, it's hard to resist)
and a little bit of twink gear.  A lot of times I fall into the trap of
thinking that all SOE cares about are the people who are level 65 with
200AA, but this seems aimed at players who are fairly new to the game and
not being PL'ed.
