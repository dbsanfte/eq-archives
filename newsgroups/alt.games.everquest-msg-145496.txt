"I just wanted to pop in and mention this to you folks.

We've come up with a change to the way the cleric epic quest works that we
think will improve the situation around Ragefire. We'll be putting it in
with the patch tomorrow. Look it over and send comments to use via the Dev
Corner.

No specifics, no mention of exactly how it's going to change.  Wild rumors
that it's gonna involve farming mobs in Skyfire for rare drops in order to
trigger RF, all unconfirmed.

Man, I'm excited.  I'm 21st on my server's RF list, which meant no epic
until Xmas.  I hope this change means I get it sooner.
