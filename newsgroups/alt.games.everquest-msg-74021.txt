  Just gain levels.  There are very few "schemes" for making a lot of
money that work before level 20 (most of the 1000pp per hour schemes,
presuming they work, involve having a level 50+ character).  Around
level 20 you can kill a few mobs which drop respectable loot (1-10pp
per kill on average).  Before then you can fight wisps for lightstones
(worth about a platinum) and greater lightstones (worth about 8) but
you need a magic weapon, which may be difficult for a poor, low level
druid to scrounge up.  You can fight bears for a shot at a high
quality bear skin (10-30pp depending on your server) though they are a
semi-rare drop (though at least the bears are plentiful and the lower
level ones are easy to kill).  You may also be able to sell
cat/wolf/bear pelts of low, medium or high quality for around a
platinum each.  You may be able to sell stacks of bone chips for about
1-5pp.  The Warrens, at lower levels, are an excellent place for
money... even the lower level kobolds may drop bronze weapons worth
2-5pp, plus molars which you turn in to a quest NPC for coins and a
shot at ringmail armor (which sells for platinum).  You can sell
Deathfist or Crushbone belts in the appropriate zones for around a
platinum each, on most servers.

  If you have a very good understanding of the value and worth of
items (unlikely given your level of inexperience) then there can be a
lot of money to be made simply sitting around in the East Commons,
buying low and selling high.  Of course even with the right knowledge,
you need a good bit of starting capital to do that.

  Don't worry too much about money, though.  A druid has no great need
for good equipment until the very high levels (45+) and spells don't
really start getting expensive until 14, by which time you'll probably
be able to afford most of the good ones if you follow the advice
above.

  Good luck.
