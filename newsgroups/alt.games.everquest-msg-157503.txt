    There are casters other than INT casters, you know. ;-) And not all INT
casters have a play style that involves constantly running away from what
they're fighting - I'll wager Necromancers and Enchanters would highly value
those HPs.

    Mana preservation is one of the biggest effects a caster can get. And if
you look at the original post, the poster did ask if there was any reason
for a pre-51 character to get the expansion. Something that lops 10% off the
cost of all his spells except the level 49 and 50 ones that costs vendor
junk to get qualifies as "worthy".

    BA Medallion, 750-1000 pp on Quellious. Dustscryer's Crystal Ball,
500-750 pp. This, maybe 5 pp and some travel made trivial by PoK. Also takes
a ring slot, which is generally used for "filler" WIS/INT, and leaves
Neck/Ranged open for much better items/foci (compare foci for finger with
foci for neck for details). Really, Jazz, you have to stop with this uber
attitude! ;-)
