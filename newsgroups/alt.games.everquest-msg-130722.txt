Unfortunately, I have 15 different characters, and it occurs in each
log file. When opening the files in EQLog, I have to
parse/fix/parse/fix...etc. until all discrepancies are corrected,
before it will finish parsing the file - *very* frustrating.

System clock *seems* to be performing normally. /shrug
