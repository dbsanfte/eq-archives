  So that's really the way it works, huh?  I was a bit unclear on this
(I don't have Luclin) but it kind of strikes me as unbalancing to give
Luclin users such vastly improved travel capabilities over those
without Luclin.  Or is there something here that I'm missing?

  I'm not usually one to call for a nerf, but aren't teleports kind of
a class defining ability for wizards and druids?  I realize you have
to "wait on the boat" so to speak, but still... to get from Toxxulia
to Greater Faydark you have to wait on two boats... plus running
through some of the most huge zones in the game.

  Ah well.  The "Luclin fairy" is certainly something that it sounds
like my shadow knight will make extensive use of when I finally do get
Luclin, presuming it isn't nerfed by then.
