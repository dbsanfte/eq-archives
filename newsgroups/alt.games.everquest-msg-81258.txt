I thought it was so strange when I asked my group if they wanted to roll for
the Halbard and no one was interested! Well it's there loss and my gain I
guess. The good thing about being too poor to twink yourself is when you get
something even sort of good, no one else wants it! LOL! I'll check out the
journal it sounds fun, and about Runnyeye...When can a little Wood Elf
Ranger such as myself  go there and not die so quickly that the zone is no
fun to play. Every time I've tried it I have so many Mobs jump on me at once
I have to zone out to keep myself alive. I'm often playing at odd times
(when my baby is napping) so groups are not always possible. Luckily I am
usually able to find groups in more crowded zones like HH, but when I zone
into Runnyeye the place is often empty. Thanks *).
