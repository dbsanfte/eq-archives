"Eric" either got a different deal or upgraded his a bit compared to how
ours came. :-(

No clue. I'll take his word on it.

Nope. THis one came with only 64 MB 100MHz SDRAM which a friend later
upgraded to 128 with a couple of 32 MB chips he had laying about. I've
now upgraded it to 386 which is the max this mobo will take. (Three
slots with a max of 128 accepted per slot.)

> Creative TNT2 Ultra 32MB AGP Graphics Card

Nope again. Came with an Nvidia 16 MB card. I've ordered a new one.

> Sony 52X CD-ROM Drive

Not even close to that nice. I think the CD-ROM is an 8X but have to
check.

Didn't get that.

Nope. *sigh*

Maybe, but I gutted out the modem card and stuck in a 10 mb ethernet
card when we got cable.

Yes indeed.
 
I have to find out where Eric shops. He certainly got a nicer one than
us.

That's not the listing I got. It's listed as only accepting 128 per
slot, so that's all I ordered. I think perhaps Eric has a different mobo
than mine came with.

Man, I really hope this doesn't become an issue. The card we ordered is
that (not looking up the real name again) Geforce II max 400 64 MB
thingie that everyone reccomended. Would that classify as "newer" in
terms of screwing with her power supply?
