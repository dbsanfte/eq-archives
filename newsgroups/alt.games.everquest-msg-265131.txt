Agreed, mostly because I'd like the tone and character of the new group to be
similar to this one, and that seems more likely once the game is established.

I suspect a new group WILL be a good idea, but letting the game get going and
settled first will make for a calmer group of posters.  IMO.

Both will happen.  A lot will play both, a lot will play one or the other, and
a lot will play one but be interested in the other.  It's easy enough to read
2 groups for the overlapping cases.

Unlikely.  Server consolidations mean the game has passed it's peak, but are
no indication of how steep the decline is.  I imagine EQ1 will be around for
YEARS, even if they decide to consolidate to half or 1/3 as many servers as
they now have.

>4) EQ2 tanks.

Unlikely as well.   

>As far as I can see, only choice (1) above would predicate a new newsgroup.

As far as I can see, only choice (4) precludes a new newsgroup.  Choice 2
still benefits from 2 groups, as it's easy to read both if you want, and many
who play both may still only be active in the group for one.  Choice 3 argues
for a rename, which is basically making a new group and letting the old one
die.

All that said, waiting a few months will make it clear what's needed.
