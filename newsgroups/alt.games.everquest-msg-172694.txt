All fine and good, except that it's my time that goes into getting that
gear.  Sure, other people put in their time too, but they got their DKPs and
subsequent gear.  If he owns the gear that I worked for, that means he owns
my time.  That dog don't hunt.

Buy/win?  If you get better gear either way, doesn't it still help improve
the guild?  I think maybe there are some officers and guild leaders in EQ
who are control freaks.  Best to avoid them it is.
