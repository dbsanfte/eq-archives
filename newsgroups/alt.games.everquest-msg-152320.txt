Marriage and Children.

Seriously, once my friends got kids they all had less and less
time to do anything like play D&D. We used to play every weekend
then 2 times a month then once a month, then it finally just died.

With EQ we can play together every night. They don't have to leave
their kids or get a baby sitter. They can play at their convenience
at any time they want. They don't have to drive anywhere, etc.
