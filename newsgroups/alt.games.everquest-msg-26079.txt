I am running an Athlon 600MHz machine with a Voodoo 3 3500TV video card.
After Monday's patch my graphics have been messed up. Surfaces of walls and
the ground when they are close to me are scrambled. I changed the the
primary display driver. Walls appear normal, but pieces of NPC's (shins,
forearms etc) are missing. I called thech support and they said this was a
common problem with people using 3Dfx video cards. Since the company is out
of business the drivers are not being updated, and the last patch exceeded
the abilities of the latest drivers from 3Dfx. The sent me a small program
to update my registry, but it did not help. They also said that eventually,
I will not be able to run EQ at all, as my driver will become too obsolete
over time.

I know I can replace my video card. I would rather not go to that extreme. I
had the same problem with my sound card. It's manufacturer, Aureal, also
wen't out of business. However I was able to find a website
(www.vortexofsound.com) that had drivers written for Aureal cards by
independent writers. Is there anything comporable for 3Dfx cards?
