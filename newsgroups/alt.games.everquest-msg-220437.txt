I'm curious...what archetype is Ivanova?  I've often loved her character
because she complete blows "strong female" stereotypes out of the water.  
Strong female characters (ignoring the Delenn's, Dr. Crusher's, and Deanna
Troi's here...I'm referring to women holding tactical and martial roles)
are often portrayed as either completely unbelievable as someone who would
rise to that position, or believable only because they've become
completely de-ovaried (what is the female version of "emasculated"?).  
Ivanova is a woman who does not use "feminine power" nor "pretend to be a
man"...she just has a confident and capable personality (most of the time
anyhow...sometimes the acting slips and I find her command presence
unconvincing).  

There is no crone, maid, mother, or witch in her.  Does she have an
archetype?
