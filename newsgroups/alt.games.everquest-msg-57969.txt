Haha.  You think they can fit an EQ world on one server, with 100
times the number of users you had, using on average way more bandwidth
per user, and with those 3000 users needing semi-real time response
from a database?  An EQ server consists of 15-20 physical machines,
which is about what those of us who actually know something about
server design would expect.
