Closing in on lvl 60, and I was wondering about spell stacking.
Can someone tell me if there are any spell in this list that dont stack...
Mask of the hunter, protection of the glade, KEI, mask of the stalker, POTC,
mask of the hunter.
I expect POTG and POTC dont stack, but what of the others.

Also is mask of the hunter really a spell? Seems to be the same as mask of
the stalker with a higher mana cost. Ive never seen it.

Another question, is the next title for a female druid after baroness
"venerable"? Whats the requirements for this title, and is there any title
beyond this?

Is there any suitable place to get xp at 60 using dire charm for a druid (ie
lvl 45+ animals)

thanks in advance.
