Pets might be different in Cabilis, I've never messed around there
except with an Iksar character.  But I have wandered past old-world
NPC Necros who I was KOS to with Invis up and their pets did not
agro me.  In fact, Invis or not Invis, every time I have conned an
NPC pet that was not already agro'd on me it has been indifferent.
That's every time, as in without a single exception.
