What do kaladim dwarves have ANYTHING to do with velious factions?

It is however, possible for someone (helps to be a rallos zek worshipper)
to be non-KOS in thurgadin and kael drakkel. It is also possible (but more
difficult) to be non-KOS in skyshrine and kael drakkel. And there is the
easiest combination of being non-KOS in skyshrine and thurgadin.

What is likely not possible is being in good standing with all 3 cities.

Sorry, but that is a load of shit. It is designed with opposing factions,
but there is no right or wrong answer to which to follow.

They also get to hunt in all those places without consequence.. Want a ac7,
int/wis/dex/str/sta/ agi/cha/cold/fire/magic/disease/poison+6, hp35 mana35
necklace? Can't get that as a dragon ally. Being giant factioned gives you
access to FAR more hunting grounds than dragon/dorf faction. Dragon/dorfs
gives you kael. Giants gives you thurgadin, icewell, skyshrine, wuoshi,
kelorak'dar, west wastes, and the better 2/3rds of ToV.

Is giant faction the best? That is up to the individual/guild, but trying
to claim that velious is intrinsically designed for dragon/dwarf followers
is just mindless.

Verant made a mistake in removing the "boss" faction from the armor quest
givers. Silly that the only mob in the entire game on the Yelinak faction
is Yelinak.

Yes you can. The main guild on my server kills all three of those all the
time (and also the orb of infinite void guy, forget his name), and they are
strongly pro-giant.
