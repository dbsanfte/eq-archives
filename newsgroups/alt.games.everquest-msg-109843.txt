No, the there is also the difference between right and wrong, and legal and
illegal.  Whether Dahmer knew what he did was wrong is irrellevant to the
question of criminal guilt.  To the question of moral guilt he may be
innocent, but I doubt it.  I think he really knew what he did was wrong, and
him denying he knew to the world or to himself will never absolve him of
guilt if it exists.
