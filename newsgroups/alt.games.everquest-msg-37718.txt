    Apparently so. It has yet to be seen if these quests result in something
worthwhile or just crystallized shadow weapons with one less delay or one
more damage, or if the KejekanVillage faction will ever lead somewhere.

    I don't even think that many druids and necros will be there. The spawn
mix is horrible in many places, and people were reporting heightened resist
rates (yeah, they do every patch, but still). The Elder Granitebacks were
still almost all blue at 42, meaning they'd green likely around 44 - but
they hit in the low 70's. Greater Kobolds in Sol B hit for barely more than
that - 76 max? - and don't green entirely until low 50's (start to green at
46). Why do more work than I have to? Unless the stackable pelts that were
dropping have tailoring uses, the zone will calm down quickly to the
Snowbeast farmer.

    I imagine they didn't want to make the bind point be the logical Kejekan
Village, as then evil tanks that wanted to kill cats would complain how
"unfair" it is.

    You're spoiled by always having it, Dennis. ;-) My warrior bandage-solos
the dead side of Dead Zone-in in Lower Guk. She'd LOVE snare - I could do
the top live frog as well if I had that thing. It's a neat item, and
level-appropriate. I don't know why they made it No Drop, though - I can't
imagine farming the Prince exclusively for this, but I can imagine a class
with snare (like a necro) wanting to sell this to a class that doesn't have
Snare.

    The person who reported the stats actually bought it off one of the
merchants, after the player who'd quested it sold it in disgust. Sold for
the price of Fine Steel, was purchasable for 13 pp. No mention if it had an
interesting graphic or not.

    IIRC, in the thread on EQTraders it was discovered that some of the
Iksar recipes that Klok mentioned were for quests, so you couldn't make the
dish but you could get it someplace. In any event, these were simple recipes
to experiment with - Chocolate Covered Cherries would be chocolate, Marr
cherries, and perhaps frosting, with the Pixie Powder Cinnesticks being
pixie dust, cinnamon sticks, and again perhaps frosting or clump of dough. I
just wanted an exact recipe to report to EQTraders, since both sounded like
really neat recipes for foragers. (My baker is a dwarf, so no experimenting
for me.)
