Yes, I read every word. However, still being new to EQ I sometimes have a
hard time putting some combinations of things into context with my question.
People would say it's class specific, or race specific, but , when I'm
trying to mix the two together does the class specific override race
specific, do they work together to overcome some shortcoming I don't
understand, do these type of things cancel each other out, like stacking
buffs can do, etc, etc,....
