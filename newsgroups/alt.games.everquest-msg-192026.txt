My server too.  High end guilds couldn't give a shit what kind of
person you are, if you trained mercilessly through your 65 levels, if
you were a rampant KSer, if you were a complete unrepentant prick, a
ninjalooter;  they don't care.  All they care about is whether they
need your class and if you're there and can do what you're supposed to
do when the time comes.  On your own time, you can grief to your
heart's content.

I'll never forget the time when a monk from the top guild on the
server, *right in front of his guild leader*, promptly went about to
move all the merchants in one zone off their spawn point, so that all
20 of the newbies in the zone would have to go somewhere else to sell
off their rat furs and snake skins.  There was no reason for him to be
doing this, other than to be a prick, and the guild leader knew what
he was doing.  Top guild on my server.
