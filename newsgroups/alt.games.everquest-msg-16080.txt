I don't know how many people actually pay 300pp for a Wu's tunic. That's a
price tossed around over at eqtraders, where some people say that 75pp per
silk swatch used is the pricing scheme they thing is "fair." I apid 120 for
a foreman's tunic on Lanys, where the prices seem to be ridiculously low.

You should be able to sell it for that. Some people like the "Gi" look
instead of the foremans/lockjaw graphic anyhow. I'm wearing a CCS right now,
but would like to find a different robe. I'm used to the idea of wearing a
dress (haha), but don't like looking like every other monk in Velious. :-)
