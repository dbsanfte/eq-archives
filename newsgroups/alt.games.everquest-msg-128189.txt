We have student, staff and general public paying customers who have dial-in
accounts. ISP related problems are only about half our problems though, the
Uni has online enrollments (no alternative) is moving towards a server
terminal Citrix enviroment in some areas  for staff. Then there are lot's of
miscellaneous systems all over the Uni which people love to put together but
no-one wants to administer...ie, web delivered course content etc so we
invariably get left holding all the hot potatoes.

The students tend be OK if not bit too....umm..."gifted" (lotsa intellegence
but no common sense), well, apart from the arts and business subject ones
which have no friggin idea and proudly expound all the time they are not IT
students. Pride in ignorance is so charming...  Every now and agian we will
get an IT student who doesn't know stuff like what FTP is... that's a
concern but we generally don't hear from them unless something is down.

The external customers...well, they are the ones I orginally had in mind
when I commented but fellow staff members are much much worse. Funnily
enough the academics are better than general staff - they are curious and
listen. The clerical staff.....  *shudders*  ....won't got here, children
