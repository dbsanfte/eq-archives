but you can only use this particular (no drop) rune of astral for the Ice
Comet spell, as it can only be combined with the (no drop) rune of frost
that
you get from the same quest.
the no drop rune of astral cannot be combined with any non no drop runes,
therefore, it cannot be used for Super Nova.

the rune of Astral does also drop, and that is the one you need for super
nova, along with the rune of impetus that drops.
