The range starting in the mid 180s or so to somewhere a bit over 200 is 
generally considered the hell levels for tradeskills.  Skillups are few and 
far between.  The cost of components has nothing at all to do with skillup 
rate.  There are many theories as to what might affect it, some people say 
that skilling up on items that are 10 to 20 points from trivial is best, 
others say it makes no difference so long as it is not trivial.

Pottery was nerfed a while back to reduce the skillup rate, it used to be 
truly easy to skillup in, now it's on par with most other tradeskills.
