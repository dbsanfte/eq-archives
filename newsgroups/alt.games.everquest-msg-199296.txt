So I was happily retired from EQ.  Husband and I discovered an entire new
level of not bickering (they say EQ can ruin marraiges, but man, I thought
that was only if both of you didn't play!), and as we become nicer and
nicer people, we also lost weight and got in shape.  Not playing EQ seemed
like a really good thing for us.  We sold our gaming laptops to pay off
credit card debts even.  

Oh, we had intentions of building new computers in time for EQ2.  I wasn't
in a hurry, until I beat BG2 on my little laptop (no 3D acceleration, 4MB
memory graphics card), and wanted some Neverwinter Nights.  let's build
our computers earlier, I said.  Maybe, I even mused, we'll give EQ a try
again, that festering cess-pit of d00ds, flames, camps, and general
pissiness.

Then SOE gives us 7 days free.  

I say...I'll just stop by to chat to old friends who were not very good at
email.  Which is good for 7 days.  There is much to-do and friends telling
us to come back...hard on the heart-strings to be sure.  Still, chat is
all I do.  Again, 4MB graphics card with no 3-d acceleration.  Even
old-world without retexturing and no luclin graphics is unpleasant.

But THEN...the 7 days are up and my free time isn't over.  So...I
figure...I'll play with my lowlevel magician, just for kicks.  I get her
up a few levels so she's even with my husband's low-level character.  And
my subscription still hasnt' run out.  So I log on my beastlord for some
nostalgic "chase the elusive young rockhopper".  10 days pass, still have
access.  I'm starting to have fun.  Sure, I'm blind as a bat in the Shar
Vahl pit with 5% clip plane on, and my un-luclin character is completely
naked due to graphics clitches, but...eh...somehow it's stil fun.

14 days today, and WHAM...access denied.

"Dear, can we get those computers even sooner?"

/sigh

I am SUCH a sucker.  And Verant is very very clever.
