It's really pretty easy.  Try to log in during a patch to create a new
character (since you won't get in, the "to create a new character" part is
irrelevant, but is included for "frame of mind").  When you fail, do the
logical thing and go to www.everquest.com.  Start clicking and make note of
when and where you find a path that gets you to an accurate network status. 
Hardly impossible.

I went to my bank and asked what my balance was.  They said to look in the
forums on their website.

I went to Walmart and asked how much a 24 pack of Mountain Dew was.  They
said to look in the forums on their website.

I stopped at a used car lot and asked how much a 2002 Volkswagen Jetta they
had was.  They told me to look in the forums on their website.

Being told where to look does not make not having the information in an
illogical place any less illogical.

I can simply see Lance's point.  I'm at work while EQ is patching, so it
almost never impacts me and I've never bothered to go any farther than the
EQ patcher to find out whether I can log in or not.
