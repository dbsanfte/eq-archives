I TOTALLY AGREE.

I type just as fast as the words appear in my head... and I don't have any
idea WHY it's so hard to type "please" instead of "please"
or.. you are instead of "ur"
or thank you!  instead of "ty"

not only does "Thank you! :)" look better, it seems a lot more personal to
me than somebody saying "ty" /bye.

That really pushes my buttons...
