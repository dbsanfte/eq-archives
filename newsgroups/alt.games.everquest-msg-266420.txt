That is exactly why my ex-mother-in-law hated me...[John's mother 
and sister worked for Weyerhauser in Oregon]

I kept pointing out that their replanting was screwing up the 
environment, and that the <animal du jour> was NOT going to 
happily change from living in a deciduous forest to living in an 
evergreen forrest, and that clear cutting does *not* in fact help 
control forest fires, but encourages errosion of topsoil and also 
encourages the wrong regrowth because after a forest fire certain 
plants grow because the heat is needed to start the cycle over again.

She kept saying how ecologically responsible Weyerhauser 
was...yikes.....She was aghast that I insisted the only thing 
that would be ecologically responsible would be to plant back the 
exact mix that they clear cut, or selectively cut only specific 
trees...

But then again she didnt seem to understand I had nothing to do 
with John's decision to settle in Norfolk VA insted of running 
home to Oregon and mommy=\ She hated that I can never get 
pregnant, and am *not* catholic, and did not intend to convert.
