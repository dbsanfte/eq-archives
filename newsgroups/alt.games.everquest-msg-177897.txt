Floormates of mine in my first year of college decided to play yet another 
practical joke on the guy across the hall from me.  The dorm I was in was 
the oldest on campus and was still running on steam (?) heating.  We each 
had this huge iron heater in our room that pinged and clanked all day and 
night.

They took the cover off of his, dumped a liberal amount of pig shit on it, 
put the cover back on, and turned it all the way up on a Friday of a 
weekend he was gone to Reserves.  By Sunday afternoon, the whole floor was 
evacing to zone.
