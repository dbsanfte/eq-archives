The trials were balanced with the idea that the groups going in would be all
level 63'ish or higher.  For melees it's especially important, since thats
also when the mobs in executioner turn light blue, giving an increase in
damage.

Sounds like it.   Goes back to what I was saying earlier about describing
the gear being all relative.   The druid that I considered in "average" gear
had full Skyshrine armor.  The Shaman who was the other "average" equipped
had the Vindi Breastplate and full Skyshrine else.  All had epics or better,
of course.  The "uber" rogue was an old friend in a big raiding alliance,
so, while I didn't look exactly at what he was using, I'm sure it's *very*
nice.

No idea if our shaman casted Malo on the executioner or not.  I don't think
he really had time if he slowed it as fast as he called "slowed".   Torpor
was only used to heal in between the waves, and twice I had to click it off
because he casted it a second or two too early.

Tigirs only really got mentioned since we went out of our way to get it for
him prior to the trial.  Meemer's "Tigirs, no enchanter" strategy was what
we had in mind, it just didn't turn out to be necessary, as we managed to
win without having to drop one for another damage dealer.
