I can't think of many situations in which a cleric per group wouldn't
be better served by a druid or shaman per group.  People other than
the MT are not supposed to be sucking up damage like its going
out of style!  OK, facing serious AE damage you may have that
special situation, but its not the reality in 9 out of 10 raids.  At 4
clerics you usually have all the healing you need for a CHeal chain
of any duration, which means the leftovers are being relegated to
group healers but their groups don't have anyone in them who
is supposed to need massive healing!  If the new "IHeal" changes
come thru, then this will be even more true than it was in the past.

Adding bash and the ability to do some melee damage makes the
game easier for clerics?  Makes them more desirable, yes, I can
see that.  But there aren't many situations where this gives them
less to do.  Perhaps you think of bards as the easiest class of all,
since they are so very very busy?  If I wanted easy, I'd sit, heal,
sit, like everyone always asked me to.  And these changes would
mean precisely nothing to me, because my offense, weapons skills,
defence, and conjuration skills would all be zero, so I wouldn't be
able to contribute a thing I couldn't before.  Suddenly I'm rewarded
for my silly melee hobby by becoming significantly more desirable
than the 5/6ths clerics out there who never bothered.

While going up against a boss mob, yes, I want a warrior and another
warrior standing behind him to take over when defensive drops on the
first one, it IS really true the rest of the time.  Because there is so much
"all/all" armor out there that monks can adopt, their AC gets much higher
than intended.  And because AC isn't scalable, the fact that warrior
AC can get much higher doesn't matter.  Monks are better at damage
mitigation than warriors are, and they have the added benefit of being
able to FD if the CHeal is running late.  The fix you imply would be
perfect, making AC contribute proportional to its value across the board;
oddly, the fact that they seem to have made just this sort of change
with regards resists gives me hope they will do the same here.  I'd
-love- to see a difference between a caster with a 400 AC and a 600 AC,
right now both might as well be wearing the same brand of Kleenex.
And I'd love to see a difference between a warrior with 1400 AC and
one with 1800 AC, right now both might as well be wearing the same
brand of aluminum foil.
