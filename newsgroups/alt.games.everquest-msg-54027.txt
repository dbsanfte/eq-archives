Hmm... Social relationships are the real black hole... They tend to rob me 
of quite a lot of EQ time...

"I'm sorry guys, I can't go on the raid tonight... I promised I'd go to 
this party..."

}And I do not care how well-adjusted you think you
}are, if you are a serious EQer, other areas of your life will suffer - be it
}social, professional, school-related, or family.  Even when you are not
}playing it, I bet you are thinking about it, about how to equip your
}character, what new class you may want to play, class balance, etc.  And how
}can you focus on other tasks with this monkey on your back?

I like monkeys.  They're silly.  And the monkey equipped in my back slot 
has Flowing Thought I.  So ner.

}If you are a serious EQ player, and if you are honest with yourself, you
}will know that what I am saying is true.  Since I have quit, I am much
}better off in most aspects of my life.  Having dollars in the bank is much
}more rewarding than plat.  You only have so much time in a day - focus it on
}activities that will build a foundation for your future - not this drivel.

Ok, here's the funny part... I'm effectively making money by spending all 
my spare time playing EQ.  An hour sitting playing EQ is an hour I'm not 
out buying things I don't need.

}The bottom line is that if an activity is having an overall negative impact
}on your life - drop it.

Oh, you're right, I -should- stop responding to trolls...
