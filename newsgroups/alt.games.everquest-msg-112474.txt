Nortlav used to be an incredibly difficult mob for my guild to take. All I
can really tell you is to use standard VS (not vsr) tactics. Get your runes,
buffs, etc BEFORE the fight begins, and have at least 4 clerics on your
C-heal chain. The warlord tank was a Good Idea (tm) and almost necessary for
ole Nort. Once you do him successfully though, he is cake after that. We did
him and Yael at the same time (albeit unintentionally) a few weeks ago.
(congratz to our MT on his new uber shoulders , ore from Master Y was last
piece).
