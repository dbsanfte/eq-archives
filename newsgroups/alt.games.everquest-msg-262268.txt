This is not 100% true, not all ASUS motherboards can even run SP2, it has to 
do with the version of the microcode. So if you are using an ASUS 
motherboard, I would check thier site for support for SP2, or get a new 
motherboard. If you install it and it does not work, you would need to put 
the drive into another computer and change some files around, boot into 
something else and change some files, or reinstall the OS completely (not 
going to SP2 obviously). This is an SP2 problem not the motherboard 
manufacturer's problem...............
