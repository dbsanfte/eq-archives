Well I only own a pc at this moment I have a bunch of games on it, but some
I don't play often.
I still play UT regularly besides EQ, especially after I 've been trained a
few times and want to get rid of some frustration. Or just before I fire EQ
up. Blast a game or two on UT and usually quit when I'm the top fragger on
the winning Domination team (I consider myself above average, not an expert
or master).

I also play Serious Sam a bit now and then, but I've never gotten past a
certain area where a huge red bot suddenly appears right in front of you.
Going to play this in co-op next Gamesday on work, I might get past it then.

--Same games I still have on my hard disc but haven't played for the last
few months are:
Black & White: I got pretty damn bored after I couldn't get that damn ape to
stop tossing people around (took me a week of failures, no luck, never
restarted it since then).

Alice: I like the atmosphere but the game seems too straight forward and a
lot of cutscenes could have been "mini-games". Don't know where I am right
now, but I'll restart if I ever play it again.

Red Alert 2: I like this game but the AI is too boring. 1 is too easy even
on the hardest level, more then one and they all gang up on you. 2 is
manageable, if barely, more is simply overkill. I did try to pick watermaps
because the IA is pretty lame when it can't get it's first tankrush to you
in 10 minutes. After that it's singling out a camp and nuke it. Only played
at gamesdays and even then not much (I tend to win, because I've played most
RTS since Dune 2 and know what works).

Diablo II is still there waiting for the expansion.
PS:Torment and Baldur's Gate I won't play anymore I think. My preference for
games has shifted to more action centered
Undying has a good feel, but Like Alice isn't played since a long time.

For the rest I have quite a lot of games from bargain bins and
which-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-moment (Conquest Earth anyone?). These
are not played anymore.

--For the non-computer games:
I still have together with some friends quite a lot of warhammer miniatures
(every army at least capable of 1500 points without magic items, besides
Chaos Dwarfs. They're just ugly)
And like you we also like to play RoboRally. With 6 persons capable of
playing it and at least 3 get together every Sunday evening it's still
played a lot.
Other games like "Die Siedler von Catan" (The Settlers from Catan?) and a
lot of other boards games we lend from friends and local bars and such
normally get played once or twice then discarded.

As a last: We also played Warhammer Quest for a while. You have
boardelements which can be put together in any sequence that you want and
represent a dungeon in which you can hunt. A sort of random system of
drawing cards determines what you encounter and what loot you get etc. We
were quite inspired from this game but it was too limited for our taste.
Ever since then most "meetings" eventually degrade in discussions on how
best to set up a fighting/skills/experience system for role-playing.

Fhew

The End
