the necro guild is really not that hard to find.  i'll give you directions:

as you enter neriak you go down a hill and through a gate.  you will see a
door in the middle and 1 on either side.  go through the one to the right.
once through, take a left and follow the path as it curves around and on you
left you should see a hill that leads down.  note: do NOT take the hill
leading up, that's the wrong one.  this should get you to neriak commons.

once in the commons, go down past the little pond thingie, through the gate,
and over the hill.  now you should come to 2 doors.  take the one by the
armor place (i think it's left???).  turn left and you should find yourself
passing neriak downunder (there are 2 entrances to neriak downunder, so look
for the one that has the flag on the outside by the door, instead of on a
completely different wall from the door) and a fountain type thing.  ahead
you should see another hallway.  go down that hallway and you should end up
in neriak third gate.

in neriak third gate, go around the pond (or mote, or river,  you know, the
water...) and on the other side should be another hall.  after that there it
is pretty self-explanatory until you come to another room that has 2 ways to
go.  take the left one and you should see a building with stairs (NOT a
building with a ramp).  if you go just to the right of the stairs, there is
yet another hallway.  go down there and you should see some ghouls.  pass
the ghouls and you'll be there!

ok, so maybe it is a little confusing...i guess i just didn't realize how
complicated it was until i began writing this post...hope it helps anyway.

ps
this is all from memory so there might be a couple mistakes in the direction
that you turn, but i know i got all the landmarks right.
