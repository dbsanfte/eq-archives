FWIW, I don't want to make it sound like I'm slagging monks, or any
other class here.  

I have yet to see any class that can't make themselves useful to any
group.   Sometimes, you have to look for situations to make a certain
class show their stuff, but every class can be, and is useful.  Just
depends on the person sitting behind the keyboard.
