bull.

granted I don't have 6500 hp like your warriors (i am at 5.5+ tho) but then
im not a warrior, im a monk

I've had a druid keep me up versus WW tov, HoT, nToV.. I've had a druid keep
me up versus the dark assasin crap that got trained into camp lastnight
before we killed rc/doomshade

> I cannot heal rampage victims. In some cases I can't even heal my party's
AE damage

A druid can easily keep somebody healed from rumblecrush, tormax etc
rampage, and neither are particularly "gimpy" mobs

>(ask me about Hoshkar sometime).

Clerics can't keep me healed against one of the triplets ae's... omg clerics
are useless!! they need new heals!!

Sure your not effective against Hoshkar... but theres a million other mobs
where your heals are more than good enough versus an AE
