Low collects like that are bugged somewhat in my experiance. Any collect can
have long dry spells. Its very important to not skip *any* mobs. I learned
my lesson on a MM collect, it had been a while since we get any drops and we
had wiped twice due to gating. In overtime I pulled the two mobs I skipped
and both dropped the bones we needed then I pulled one more mob and we got
last bone. If I had just pulled and killed those two mobs before we would
have won.
