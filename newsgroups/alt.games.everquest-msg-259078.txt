    The guild we compete with gets strat information from Martin's
competition, who steal info off his boards. You never know who people are
friends with, or who they used to know before moving servers.

    You've misunderstood. By my logic, until you've seen how competition
works at the high level you cannot say with any authority how a close
working relationship would work between guilds. For example, we despise our
nearest competition. The philosophy they use in running their guild makes us
wish their officers were placed naked in tiny, sealed rooms with angry
ferrets. We don't want to see them achieve anything worthwhile in Everquest,
and we especially don't want to feel that we couldn't have achieved any of
our goals without their help. So why would we work with them?

    At least on my server, rotations have been handled well ever since
mid-PoP. We don't want to waste our time on fighting when the eventual
solution, imposed by a GM, will be worse than what we can work out between
ourselves. But we don't want to have to rotate in the first place, and
neither do they. We only do this when we must, because the competition is in
the same non-instanced zone as us.

    Which is the way the top players seem to want it. There was a thread on
FoH's site in the past month or so talking about the Zun event, and how it
was so crazy that beating the event depended so strongly on random luck. As
the discussion evolved, it became clear that the people who left EQ liked
challenges where, even if they knew the encounter, they could lose because
of something random happening. The people who still play EQ, on the other
hand, regarded learning the encounter as the real challenge, and once that
was done they didn't want random stuff wasting their time. I have to agree -
once I learn an encounter, and my guild has their execution down pat, I
don't want some completely random factor to kill us and waste our time as we
farm our loot.

    There aren't ways to make EQ "more truly challenging" without the
annoying tricks in scripts. Try and think of a few which, if the players
knew it was coming, wouldn't be trivial for a guild at a sufficient level to
beat the encounter and which wouldn't piss the players off.

    As it should be. Imagine that there was a camera that showed the gun of
death. You'd see the gun, run up the ramp, and move on instead of being
blown away, trying alternate strats (can I hide anywhere on the ramp? can I
jump to avoid the gun?), and settling on a final plan. One system
spoon-feeds you the information you need to solve the problem, the other
makes you earn that information. EQ players, at least the top-end ones, want
to earn their information.

    Only if you assume that all obstacles the devs put in our way can be
overcome, which I wouldn't assume. ;-)
