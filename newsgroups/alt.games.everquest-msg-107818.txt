I pretty much solo'd to 35 with an untwinked Warrior but I spent time making
plat to ensure I had faily decent (at the time) equipment. It was after then
that I was forced to group, might be possible to solo old world mobs with
newer equipment but I wouldn't really want to try.
The problem is, although after 35 you can still solo a blue mob it will take
all your health and binding will only give you 50%, that means a lot of
sitting on your butt, it's ok if you are in no rush to level and have
friends to chat to while doing it but if you want to make exp effectively
then solo'ing, for a warrior is out. 30 -35 was still slow, I didn't care
but I wouldn't recommend it.
If, that warrior is twinked (regen item, some low proc'ing weapons, haste
etc) then the answer might be a little different.
