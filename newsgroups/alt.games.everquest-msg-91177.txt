Try sitting in Gen Chat sometime... Right after a server comes up...  First
30 lines you will see is:

"I can't log onto my server!"

or

"It took me forever to log on!"

What's really interesting... Is the fact that some of these guys then say
the following when told the login server is congested and to keep trying...

"You guys make billions of dollars and you don't have enough to get another
login server?"

Let's just conviniently ignore the fact, that there are approximately 1.5k
players per server, and there are approximately 42 to 43 servers, which
means you are looking at about approximately 53k to 54k people hammering on
a few servers to get authorization, which still has to go to one main
database of where the passwords are stored to verify the password.  Which
means, *gasp* you can stick a bunch of login servers to try and authorize
as many users as you can, but if you only have one source for password
verification, your point of failure is limited by the choke point, which
would be, *GASP* the password database server trying to handle 53-54k
requests for information.  Of course, the 'logical' customer base, the one
who believes Verant has 'billions of dollars' and raping us over the coals,
doesn't seem to be on this plane of reality.

It might be interesting to see how well a person can cope with 40 people
poking them to do something simultaneously.

Another fun one I heard, was a guy who said he could 'code' better than the
people currently working at Verant.

Well, this may be all well and good, but, given he isn't WORKING for them
or perhaps knows the code of the game... And being a programmer myself...
One of the things I have learned, it is easier to claim you can do better,
but when messing with someone else's code...  Your 'improvements' may make
things worse if you don't see where things can and often times do go wrong.

The old adage of 'The customer is always right.' kind of goes out the door
at this point.  It is too easy for people who think things that come out
these days, especially when it come to computer software, should work 99%
of the time and that the 1% that does break down, should be easy to fix.
If this world was perfect, maybe.  Things break, when they break, they take
time to fix.  Bitching about it a billion times does not make it get fixed
faster and it isn't the only thing that is being worked on.
