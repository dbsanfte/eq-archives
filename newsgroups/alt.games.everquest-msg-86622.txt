Hmm, that'd be wake of tranquility or something? aka the suicide spell.

USELESS, By Abbyss (1/28/2001)

Just for grins I memmed this spell and went to the local Dervish cutthroat 
camp and unleashed it. Of the 4 dervs at the camp all 4 resisted the first 
go. Did the AE mem blur and let them all go back and tried it again. That 
time only 3 resisted it and 1 actually stayed behind. Keep in mind there is 
about a 40 level difference here too. Testing it on just average mobs I 
hunt for exp yields similar results try it next time you get a nice big 
pull stun em all then just cast it for resists and you too will see how 
truly useless this spell is. The reality of the situation is that casting 
mesmerization then an AM mem blur costs half the mana and is about 900% 
more reliable.
