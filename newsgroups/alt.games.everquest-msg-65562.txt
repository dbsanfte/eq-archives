Basically, after reinforced (trivial 108?) you can do quivers to 115, 
Crystalline silk to 131, Wu Armour to 158, then Velious tailoring to 250 
(oh, and fleeting quivers I guess - good luck on finding the materials). 
Some races also have cultural tailoring that spans some of these trivial 
levels.
