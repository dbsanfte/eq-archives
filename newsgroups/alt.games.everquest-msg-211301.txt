No, however Kirn is entirely unnecessary to get the epic.  What you are doing with
Most of the parts of the shaman epic series of quests is getting faction.  Only a
couple of them are actually necessary steps, the rest can be skipped by doing earlier
portions repeatedly instead.  For example, taking Woe and Envy and the shield to the
Wandering Spirit in WK; you don't need any earlier part to do that, and so you don't
have to start over, you can just run to RM and get the drops, gate back and find the
spirit and hand them in, repeat.

Or you can do what I did, which is to do your exp camping in the COM stables and keep
an eye out for the courrier.  You'll collect the rest of the pages trivially while
working, getting good exp and some cash income, and every time you get the courrier
thats another big faction hit for combining the parts and running it in to the mob in
EJ.  Plus, if people are killing Lord Ghiosk you can probably get the books he drops
for the asking, another faction hit for you.

The golem in Fear you can also do solo, assuming a raid went in there beforehand to
kill the real golems and happened to leave him up; the mob isn't hard its getting him
popped that takes a village... and you can even do that with a small group provided
you don't pick on the DT golems to do it, and get lucky.
