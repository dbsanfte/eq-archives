Different. This stuff is on the web somewhere. (Caster's Realm?)

Offense and Defense cap at 5 x Level for everyone, as opposed to 
5 x (Level+1) like most other things including weapon skills for 
melees/hybrids, casting skills, Sense Heading, etc. Priests and 
pure casters have lower weapon skill caps: 4 x (Level+1) and 
3 x (Level+1) respectively.
