While I think that the 'ambush' factor you mention is rude, I will say that I
experienced this particular MGB on Torv the other day however it was announced
well ahead of time...  several times in fact.

<so and so says: MGB KEI at Pok Bank 3 min!>

<another so and so says: MGB HoV with that KEI in 3 min!>

<someone else says: MGB Ho7 with KEI and HoV 3 min!>

(Yes, Torv is AWESOME for the amount of MGB folks!  I love you all!)

<a random Mage says: MGB Mod Rods along with the KEI, HoV, and Ho7!>

<funny guy Wizzie says: MGB TL to Bind with all the other MGBs!>

This same thing played itself out at the 2 min mark and again at the 1 min mark
and finally again, right before all the spells went off...  When the TL box
came up, I got a chuckle out of it and hit decline.  However, a NOTICIBLE (? on
spelling) amount of toons suddenly *Popped* out of existence in PoK.  

Now, I personally found that pretty funny considering the amount of warning
that had been given and the fact that most of us were /say talking about how
silly that particular use of MGB is.  I am sure however that all those folks
that hit accept and TL'd before they got their HoV did not find it so amusing. 
To those people I say, read the words scrolling in front of you and pay
attention...  LOL

But yes, my rambling is leading up to me agreeing with you that simply casting
that with no warning is kinda rude...
