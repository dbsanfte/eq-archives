My guess - and that's all it is really, a guess - is that it has
nothing to do with the kick skill or special attack, since non-kicking
classes also get ID. Therefore, it is technically just damage done by
ID, not kick damage. Kind of like bash. You are bludgeoning the mob
with a blunt surface, but your 1hb skill has nothing to do with it.

It would make no sense to make kicking classes worry about their kick
special attack affecting it and have it not be an issue for
non-kicking classes.

Again, just my perspective.
