Killing more civilians tomorrow will not bring your 
civilians back, nor will it 'strike terror' into the 
hearts of terrorists.  Geez.  No offense, but certain 
americans REALLY need to get over themselves.  Hurling a 
big bomb at a country that hates your guts to begin with 
doesn't exactly open the door to a peaceful co-
existence.
