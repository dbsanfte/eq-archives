Hmmm - For myself it was basketball.  I played organized ball from 
age 6 to 31 (when I blew out my knee).  I played city league games 
until 9 or 10 at night when I had to work a graveyard shift starting
at midnight.  After I wrecked my knee (ruptured ACL, tears in the
MCL and a chunk out of my meniscus over an inch long and as big
around as your little finger) I was going to go through ACL 
reconstruction and serious rehab - JUST TO PLAY BALL.  I didn't need
it for general life (I have very good secondary restraints, and the
knee is stable in everthing except moving laterally to my left).

My doctor actually browbeat me about that, because my cartilage would
have deteriorated steadily and I would have been pretty much crippled
by the time I was 40.  I finally saw reason, and haven't played ball
since (and still miss it.)  I can't even shoot around:  When someone
moves up to defend me (even lightheartedly) I don't even think about
it and try to blow by them - and my knee buckles.

6 years later, I still get itchy fingers around a basketball court.

I wasn't quite as bad with EQ, but I definitely saw shades of that
in myself when I was playing.
