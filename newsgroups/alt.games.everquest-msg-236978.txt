Well, then you find yourself having to answer the question of the 
'reason for existence' of God. If you are going to handwave that away, 
you may as well handwave away the question of the reason for existence 
of the Universe, and again save yourself a whole entity.

Much its detriment. In fact, it turns out that random chance is the 
force behind a large number of processes, particularly in biology. The 
reason some species become extinct and others don't is due, largely, to 
blind, dumb luck, and in a much smaller amount, to evolutionary fitness, 
for example.
