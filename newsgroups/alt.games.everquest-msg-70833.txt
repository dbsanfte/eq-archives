Hi all,

A few days ago, while my level 12 Ranger was wandering around BB I ran into
a level 60 rogue who was having a bit of a house cleaning. After chatting
with him for a while I walked away with the following.

Sword of Skyfire
MAGIC ITEM   LORE ITEM
Skill: 1H Slash   Atk Delay: 22
DMG: 10  Dmg Bonus: 0
CHA: +5   HP: +25   SV COLD: +15

Dwarven Ringmail Tunic
LORE ITEM
Slot: Chest
AC: 12
SV FIRE: +8   SV COLD: +8   SV MAGIC: +8

Spider Fur Collar
MAGIC ITEM
Slot: Neck
AC: 10
STR: +7   SV COLD: +7   SV POISON: +7

Spider Fur Cloak
MAGIC ITEM
Slot: Back
AC: 10
STR: +4   STA: +4   SV COLD: +6

Black Ice Sleeves
MAGIC ITEM   LORE ITEM
Slot: Arms
AC: 13
STR: +4   DEX: +4

Now, this kits real good ( *8-) ) for my level, but could I sell it and get
a compleate suit of something that would be better for me? I've been told
that the spider fur and black ice stuff will go for about a K a piece, I
think this would give me enought to buy a complete suit of Ivy eched or
Rygor.

Should I do this, or hold on and get my Ivy at 20 like every one else?

And what about the weapon? I get daul wield/double attack in a few levels
time. So do I sell the sword and get something else?

I'm on AB if that makes any difference.

Thanks.
