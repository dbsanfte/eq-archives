How much money do you have? I've seen complete kits selling for as much as
30Kpp. Parts have sold for 3kpp.

My guild is doing the divide and conquer thing- with various folks doing the
various parts. I'm working on the baking. Will trade lucky cabbage for any
other piece right now. (on Xev). When I get up to the pic-a-nic baskets, I
hope to be able to trade them for parts too.
