By FAR prefer the old ogre and troll models. The new ogres looks like a 
retarded axe murderer, and the trolls are SUPPOSED to be fat and happy, 
not look like an ugly human with a potbelly.
Prefer the new ikky look though, although they totally ruined their 
swimming animations, were WAY cooler on old models. But the new models 
got a BIG force that old ones done, the smile on the females. Go try it, 
turn ikky new female models on, and do a smile :)
