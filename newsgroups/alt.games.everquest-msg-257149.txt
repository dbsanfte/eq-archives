I've found the same to be true recently playing an alt on Lanys,
and the cash has been adequate to cover the cloudy potions for
the trip in/out (can often get a port or TL out, which helps).
That char is one of those "melees in their fourties without
haste item" (haste items are expensive when you're untwinked).
He gets by because a Paladin can hold aggro to tank via spells,

I've been thinking it must be pretty miserable as an untwinked
Warrior in the 40s, either you've got no haste or your weapons
are crap, or both (or you kill 97 bazillion hopelessly green
spiderlings, I guess).  Some very serviceable armor is cheap,
but armor ain't worth much to a tank if he can't keep the mobs
on him.  [snip most of a rant about ignorant casters leaving
only:]  IMO, trouble holding aggro = casters getting slapped
around 20 seconds into a fight despite the fact that I pulled
with a stun, cast three more stuns, and have been meleeing as
well.  If that happens to you as a caster other than when you
are checking out new spells, you're playing stupidly and need
to put some real effort into getting smarter.  Lots smarter,
in fact, or you'll never be worth a damn working with the best
tanks in the game (Warriors) who do not have aggro tools as
good as those of a Paladin.
