Well done guys! It looks like verant will be getting a nice pay
raise,Starting in April.Lets see 400,000 subscribers and a $3.00 a month
increase in rates,$1,200,000 a month (not bad guys).Well as for this almost
3 year veteran of EQ,its time to go.The broken quests,overcrowding,consent
bugs and nerfing,server downtime,customer service in general (now you want a
pay raise?).
 I guess the Legions server was a pilot program (as far as subscription
price) to stick it to the loyal fans once again.This guy is done and its
time to move on.I have enjoyed most of the time,I spent playing EQ and have
met some real good friends along the way.They will be missed and I wish them
the best.I guess,I'll wait and see what Brad comes up with in his new
venture?Over the last year,Most of the top people have left verant.Seems
funny to me,Perhaps they seen something we as the masses didn't (just a
thought).
Those of you who remain with EQ,I wish you the best and that you complete
all the goals you set for yourselves (be it personal or guild related).
