Never played a necro but some of the obvious foci that come to mind
are Spell Haste and Mana Preservation for general stuff, Affliction
Efficiency and Burning Affliction for DOTs, perhaps Improved Damage
(if you do nukes as well as dots) and Extended Range.  Oh, and I
gather necros don't have a lot of buffs for others (besides DMF),
but for self-buffage you might want Extended Enhancement.

There are foci that reduce the mana/time for summoning pets, but I've
never seen the point to investing in those since I don't spend a lot
of my time resummoning pets.  Of course, druid and SK pets aren't all
that powerful anyway so resummoning them in the middle of battle if
they die isn't a high priority; maybe necros need to worry more about
the cost or speed of getting up a fresh pet in an emergency?

One other general remark is that many foci can be obtained via augments
bought using DON crystals.
