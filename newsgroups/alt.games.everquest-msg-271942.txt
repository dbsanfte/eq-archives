No, they aren't.  The best drop I've gotten so far (level 29
Fury Adept) came from a solo mob, as did the Bootstrutter's
quest drop and tons of other ones.   No, they're not as
common.  But you're not competing for five other players
for the actual drop, either...

No, it's just slower.   Welcome to Everquest...

I've yet to find a solo quest I couldn't solo.  Certain quests
are GROUP quests even though they're for your character.
The entire AQ series, for example.  Just because the reward
is for your character doesn't mean it's designed to be done
solo...
