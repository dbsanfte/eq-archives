It is a one-shot effect, just like manually clicking on the mob.

I am constantly amazed at good tanks that are able to keep agro off
everybody but themselves.  Battles can get extremely chaotic and I have
no idea how they manage to make sense of it all.  Coercers and
Illusionists are another group that gets my respect.  How they are able
to pick which mobs to mezz in that group that is beating on people is
just mind boggling.  Other than that, I have no clue what the easiest
way to make sure you are peeling the right mobs off people would be :)
