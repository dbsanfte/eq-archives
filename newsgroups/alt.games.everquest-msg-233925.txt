Just recently got LDON and have only done 4 dungeons so far with all being 
successful.  What is the command to autosplit the loot afterwards?  I wouldn't 
mind being the ML but so far I haven't offered to because I don't know how to 
split the loot.  Also does the autosplit split all cash I have on me so I 
would want to start out with empty pockets?  Or does it know to only split 
what I've just sold from the dungeon?
