Indeed, I don't remember hearing that the "6th member is free" part
had changed.  Where was that announced?

Not entirely true.  I camped a quest mob in Chardok a little while ago,
using good faction to make it easier to reach the camp etc., and when
possible I would FD before the killshot in order to keep my faction.
Sometimes I avoided the faction hit, sometimes not.  I thought it might
depend on whether or not the mob had "forgotten" me due to the FD, i.e.
would it still be mad at me if I stood up?  But I don't know for sure;
all I know is that I only avoided the hit part of the time, even when
I was definitely feigned before the mob died.
