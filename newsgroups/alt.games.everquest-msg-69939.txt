No wonder I'm KFed...he's full of shit.  Root works just fine to get aggro
off the rooter.  Druids (or anyone, for that matter) who root before the
critter is down to at least 95% health are stupid.  Snare has a lower risk
of aggro than tash (I have 52 druid, 55 enc) and I'm perfectly safe if I
wait until 95%.  I often use Root to get the critter's mind off me.  Unless
it breaks immediately (not likely) I'm fine.

Trouble is, by the time the critter is down to 95% health the ranger is in
KILL mode.  It's hard enough to get rangers to remember to manage their
aggro WITHOUT having to remember to snare.

Obviously I'm not talking about YOUR (the reader, whoever you might be)
ranger. ;)
