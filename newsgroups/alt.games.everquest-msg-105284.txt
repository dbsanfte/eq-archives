    I've sorta been toying with the idea of taking my (just dinged last night)
level 30 ranger over there.  I'm not expecting to get deep inside, of course,
but I am wondering if the lower level mobs near the zone might be worth a laugh
or two.  Or could I expect to be ground into elf paste the second I cast my
first snare spell?
