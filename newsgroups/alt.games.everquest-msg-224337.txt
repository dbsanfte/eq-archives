From one of the guys at SOE; I know his girlfriend.  So no link. :/  I was
wondering if it was bona fide at first, but the more I look at it, the more
it makes sense.  Had groups where we couldn't get slaughter to save our
life, then someone drops and we add on someone who's new to LDON, and
boom--we get slaughters because it changes the ratio.

I find slaughters easier because you're just on a mad killing spree and
you're not searching for anything, you can just run around blindly, but the
mobs do seem to die more slowly.  My chanter can't even get off nukes in
time on some adventures, but can get off one or two per mob in slaughters,
even with the same group lineup.
