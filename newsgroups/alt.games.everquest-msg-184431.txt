Well, I'm hardly an expert, but I'll share what I've been able to pick
up from my experiences there.  Seb is definitely BYOG, but it's a zone
where druids and wizards are good choices for a group, as the zone out
isn't exactly conveniently located.

As for loot...for cash drops, I *think* the entrance mobs can drop
gems, but I'm not positive, I've never fought them over an extended
period, just cleared them to get in.  For gear, I can think of a
couple examples.  The RBG drops from Froglok Krups...not just one
particular frog, BUT you won't find Krups at the entrance..they're
deeper in.  The RBG I won dropped at the Chef camp, but you also find
Krups at Discos, for instance.  There are named mobs deeper in
however, that drop their own loot.  The named that drops the Tolan's
Bracer, for example.

Summary: bring a group or expect to solo, and if you solo at the
entrance, you might expect to get some plat, but no goodies.
