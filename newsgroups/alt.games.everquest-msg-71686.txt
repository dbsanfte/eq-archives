Same experience here.  After Luclin, sound got better with SB Live! on
Win2K.
But recently, it's gotten worse, in fact even worse than it was before
Luclin.
For one, when I go into a bank (oddly enough) I often get these loud
feedback/buzzing noise from the speakers.  To stop it, I type /reverb
off.
However, somehow, I think, when zoning reverb comes back on again so
the next
time I bank, I have /reverb off again.

Hopefully once they settle most of the playability issues, they'll
have some
time to look at the bugs in the sound.  I don't hold out much hope,
though,
because of the amount of time they've had to fix the SB Live! w/
Win2k/XP
problems... as far as I can tell, they haven't done anything.  Or
they've
somehow gotten to a place where they think it's unfixable.  (Bugs in
the
SB Live! drivers or Win2K directsound support?  dunno, and they aren't
saying)
