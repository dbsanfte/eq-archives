IIRC, they increased all Offensive Ranger skills to that of a Warrior.
They didn't do anything to Defensive Skills however, which kinda bites. ;)

Rangers should be defined as more of Rogue + Druid than Warrior + Druid.

Course I still say that the Ranger class isn't what I'd call a true
Ranger... here's my definition of what a Ranger class should have for
abilities.

High Cap on Hide (yet lower than Rogue)
High Cap on Sneak (yet lower than Rogue)
1HS
1HB
Piercing
Throwing
Highest Archery Cap in the game
High Offensive Cap
Med. Defensive Cap
Ability to track anything that moves (as well as corpse tracking)
Forage (which VI is finally fixing)


Rangers should have Not So Good faction with merchants and townsfolk, they
should have good faction with guards though
