To add to what a few others have added to this which seems to contradict 
what i was saying, you do heal and regenerate mana if the horse is 
still.
My point is if you thinking you can heal/med and travel at the same time 
you cant, maybe you use to be able to, thats why i bought my horse as 
someone told me i could, but it seems they fixed that bug and you cant 
anymore.
