Meh... I tend to stop trying to read that kind of stuff and skim it 
after about one sentence, so the RPing is lost.  I do that with books, 
too.  As someone else in this thread said, a little goes a long way - 
and I find my imagination provides the accent all by itself - whereas 
misspellings make the discussion slower, as my brain has to go through 
the words and correct them as I go.  In grouping, especially, I find 
this very difficult to work with if we're going at a fast pace.
