They had to do SOMETHING visible to other classes to give wizards any sort
of real chance of getting groups past 50.  They're no more valuable than
they were before...but people think they are, and that's all that counts.
Mages are no stronger now, but people THINK they are because of the focus
items.  It's all perception.

It's a shame they haven't given druids any perception changes...despite
their strength they're shunned by too many people.
