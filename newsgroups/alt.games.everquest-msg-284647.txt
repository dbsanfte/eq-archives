All you need are the original registration info (the CC, CD key, first
email address, etc) then contact the CS and claim the account was
broken in or something.

If I had known my friend was going for it, I would have discouraged
him since SOE frowns on this.  It's too easy for scammer to sell
accounts, collect money, then grab account back.

I did suggest him to contact local PD since he had the address and
phone number.
