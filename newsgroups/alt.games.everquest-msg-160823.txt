I like Warrior, Cleric, Shaman/Mage/Wizard, Enchanter.  With a Shaman you
have all the buffs (including SoW), backup heal, nukes, DoTs, debuffs and a
pet at 34 for additional DoT damage.  With a mage, Pet and nukes.  With the
Wizard, you have those nukes and ports.  I would go with the Shaman first, I
think.
