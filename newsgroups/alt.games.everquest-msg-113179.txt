24... yes, 24.  I generally post right after waking up or right before I go
to bed... going to have to try to kick brain into gear before doing math sleepy

Maybe it -would- work to have a similar fix event to shorten the list so
a nudge upward in pop rate would create a steady state at their desired
length (one or two months I think has been suggested)

Aye, I'm weilding Righteousness, there's a chance I won't actually weild
the epic, just tuck it into my backpack for use.  Which is sad, really, to
think that I'm 9 months away from something I'm going to relegate to
a backpack slot like those chipped bone rods and cloudy potions.  But
I have 9 months to come up with a better weapon (or other handheld
item) than what I've got now, heck, by then I'll be laughing that I though
Righteousness was good.

Which is funny because other than the bottleneck the epic is dead easy.

I reccomend that any cleric start theirs in their 30s when the first two camps
are exp, and get in a high level guild (not Uber, just mostly 50s) and do the
remaining kills to get on that list as soon as you reasonably can.  The
SolRo kill can be handled by a group thats waiting for Naggy formup or just
after Naggy dies.  Ixiblat can be done several times in a row by a ready
group, so you can grab him when your guild next does him for a high level
cleric (he also drops actual good loot for mages, who are your most useful
raid members for killing him, a concept almost unique in EQ) and the Overking
is generally an evenings raid target, repeatedly killing him and the Queen to
get
epic drops for everyone present and some very nice random drops off both
for the rest of the raid; a satisfying raid camp for a high level guild even if
no
epics were involved.

I say this not to suggest that level 39 clerics should be getting their epics,
but
because even if you play slowly you'll -still- be up in your high 50s before
your
name comes up, and like me you'll be cursing the day you thought "I'll do
my epic in my 50's like the gods intend"
