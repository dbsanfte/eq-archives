Hmm... imagine if the world worked that way. I don't know what faction
you are on.. but i'm gonna come bust a cap in your ass to find out.
Furthermore, how auto-magically did you now understand who a mob likes
or doesn't by making it a corpse?

How about just try asking nicely? :> Unless of course they are kos to
you and then let the cap busting commence. There shouldn't be any
reason that for a non-kos mob you can't query them to find out who it
is they like or don't. Unless of course you have the mobs start
wearing gang colors. Crips over there.. bloods over here. :>
