No Jennaii, I did not.  I quoted your post in its entirety.
Go back, look at your post.
I repeat, I quoted your post in its entirety.
That includes the unattributed quote your post started with,
still unattributed when I quoted your post in its entirety.

Further, I replied to what you said, leaving the unattributed
quote there for context, when I quoted your post in its
entirety.

I'm sure there're plenty of good reasons you can come up with
for slamming me, but will you take the false allegation above
off the list, please, because I quoted your post in its entirety.

<snip the rest of Jennaii's post and all quoted materiel therein>


kaev <--- wishes it had been some poster he actually detests,
rather than Jennaii with whom he merely disagrees, who had
mistakenly accused him of a misquote
