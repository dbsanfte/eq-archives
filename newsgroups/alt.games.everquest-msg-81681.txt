Since I re-read the book (after a hiatus of 30 years or so), I can
definitely appreciate why some of you guys were screaming about how they
made the movie. However, I still think they did a good job of actually
telling the story, and that's the most important point, isn't it? It always
has been for me, though the gods know how many bad Stephen King renditions
I've had to sit through... (actually, I just don't, anymore... and I've
gotten to the point of not reading his new stuff either -- he's either
gotten to be a terrible writer or he's running out of material!)... and I
always thought that THAT was the point (the story), when they wreaked havoc
with his work. But Tolkien! Yeah, I can appreciate the wrath of die hard
fans. At the same time, I also know that the book, as Tolkien wrote it,
could NOT have been made into a movie if Jackson had had to follow it, line
by line. It stands alone, as a wonderful movie, and as a *great* book.
