I'm sure new subscriptions are down for EQ1 now that EQ2 is out. Just
picking up the box a new subscriber will look at the screenshots and choose
EQ2 over 1 on the graphics alone. I'll presume they've read next to nothing
about either and it's my guess that is what would happen. Now the problem
is they are *completely different games*. About the only things they have
in common are the names and the lore.

I don't blame them. Whenever the numbers dipped the doomesayers would be
out in force. I'm sure they've netted a gain over *both* games regardless
of perceived EQ1 losses.

From what I've heard Stromm seems to be going pretty strong. I've heard
that the PVP servers are in the process now of considering how to merge
them. You can't really judge anything by this because the PVPs have always
had shallow numbers.

As I said there's dialog right now about how to go about consolidating the
PVP servers but you can't really judge the whole of EQ by the PVPs. I'm
sure there will be mergers over the coming months. And that might not be a
bad thing. At the very least it will mean a gradual decline that the
current players can use. I see EQ being around at least for two more years
unless the accountants at SOE decide that they've milked that cow long
enough and pull the plug altogether. With all the bad publicity SOE has
gotten over the years I could see that scenario playing out - but I think
that may be the dumbest move they ever make.
