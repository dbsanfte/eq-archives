The rain spells aren't really good for that.  Each wave of damage is spread
among the mobs, so you don't really gain efficiency doing several mobs with
a rain.  With Wizards, it's all about mana efficiency.

Wizards have three kinds of AoE nukes:

1. Columns.  These hit the targeted mob, and any nearby mob.  They can hit
up to 4 mobs, I believe.  These are what we use for quad kiting.  There are
also the Al'Kabor spells, which are like columns, but weaker, with a larger
range, and maybe they can hit 5 mobs.  Al'Kabor spells are rarely used.

2. PB.  These hit every mob near the caster.  These are what are usually
used for insane AoE groups.  I've hit 22 mobs at once this way. :-)

3. Rains, as described above.  Rains also have some strange resistance
rules, being more resisted if the mob is low on hitpoints.
