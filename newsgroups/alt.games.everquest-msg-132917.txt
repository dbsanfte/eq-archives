I think its because they use pretty stock 3d program models, then just
add EQ like stuff to them. Though I also think of it as cheating, some
site I saw which just had in game models (from screenshots of the
characters with luclin models) with some photoshop work seemed better.
It was amazing that both wanted money though for what seems pretty
much like "hack" work to me.

Woody over at www.gucomics.com at least does original sigs and such
for a fee, without spamming boards or newsgroups ;)
