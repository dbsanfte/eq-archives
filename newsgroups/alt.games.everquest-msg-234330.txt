That's true, there is that hidden opportunity cost. Any time not spent
cannibalizing is a hard mana cost.

I've used my rain spells in a lot of situations and find them pretty
effective and fun. The downside is the multiple resistance check that comes
with the successive waves. Annoying  to have to get through 3 resistance
checks to pull it off completely... and I haven't done the math to see if on
balance it still nets out more efficient damage than other spells, but I'll
look into it based on your inspiration.
