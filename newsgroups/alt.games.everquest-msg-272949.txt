In EQ1 you could heal/buff the lower level character and they could power
through the mobs non-stop.

Buffs now only work in groups and the grouping range needs to be within 7
levels max IIRC at which stage the mobs would be grey.
I think the xp is also allocated based on the group range so it is alot
harder to gain xp even with that difference, you achieve a more beneficial
xp gain by grouping with others closer to your level.
