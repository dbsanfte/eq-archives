Nice word "depend" there.  If the group recognizes that it depends on
something that's costing you money, they shouldn't consider it
unreasonable to compensate you for that expense.  I certainly get
compensated for 'dot money whenever I want it when I play my cleric in
a group.  I've yet to hear someone whine at me for it.

If it's discourteous to bitch that a cleric gets compensated for
symbols, then it's doubly discourteous to ask him/her to cast symbols
in that group.

Again, get compensation from your group or just stop casting them. 
How hard is that?  I get asked for Blessing of Aegolism all the time
when I'm just slumming around in popular areas.  You can bet that I
don't cast it unless people pony up.  This may sound selfish, and
perhaps it is, but guess what, so then is whining about how important
money is in the game.

Then why are you whining about tradeskills?
