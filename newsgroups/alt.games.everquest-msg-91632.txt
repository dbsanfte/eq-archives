I say "free but donations are welcome", unless its out of my way, then they
can pay in advance. Too many times ive run across several zones to be paid
in gold/silver, or not at all. Same with my druid... I dont actually ask for
the money first, but I never agree to port them and then have to wait
around/CR for the money. Occasionally I get jacked, but I can live with
that. They only get to do it once.
As for the amount I charge, I figure 250p per hour is a decent wage for no
risk. I charge by time, not by number of rezzes. I could easily make more in
most cases if i wanted. I guess its what you want to be known as... a
mercenary or a kind samaritan.
