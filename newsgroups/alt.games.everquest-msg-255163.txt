Well, others have answered that for ya, so now for an oldbie question!

I keep having this problem, when I have two EQW sessions, where I click a 
hotkey or spell gem, switch windows and do stuff, and then when I come 
back, the cursor has picked up the hotkey or spell gem.  Generally I just 
drop the spell gem or click the hotkey back in its spot, but it's pretty 
annoying.  It seems to not do it at first, but then once it starts 
happening, it happens every dang time I switch windows until I relog.

Anyone else having this problem?  Know of a way to stop it doing that, or 
know what triggers it to start doing that?
