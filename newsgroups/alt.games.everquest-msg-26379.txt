Be aware that "weapon ratio" is actually a crappy, in accurate metric
of weapon damage output, especially at higher levels where your
"damage bonus" can greatly multiply the damage you can get out of
a weapon (which is why low-delay weapons put out much more damage
than you'd suspect from just looking at their "ratio").

For a more accurate analysis of a given weapon's damage output,
see the link I mention below.

Actually, with the proc of the Yaks, you'll get somewhat better damage
output with them than with your current weapons:

  Your current:  501 damage/minute  (at level 43)
  Dual yaks:     549 damage/minute  (at level 43)

This utility is absolutely indispensable for anyone who wants to
compare one weapon option versus another, or figure out what would
be a feasible upgrade.
