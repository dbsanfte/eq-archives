This is just plain incorrect.
It is common knowledge at the high-end game that paladins and Shadowknights
are much better taunters, and hence are often prefered tanks in EXP groups.

Warriors advantage is that the extra hp and defensive discipline, can make a
large difference when
tanking boss monsters.

Shadowknights are better at soloing. And have more utility spells (invis and
snare).
Paladins, on the other hand, are probably more usefull in raids, with LoH,
stun, hp buffs,
and suprisingly good healing with some AA.
