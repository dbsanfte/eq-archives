Yep, ye olde "how do I make PP" post.

Looking down the line a little, at level 65, I'm facing some 
outrageously high spell costs; the few 65 spells I've seen in bazaar 
have been over 40kpp.

Since returning to the game at level 60, I've not gathered more than 
1kpp at any one time, usually less than this; admittedly thats because 
I've been spending the cash as it comes in, buying ethereal parchments 
(700pp worth at a time, more than once) or buying specific spells. 
Still, I'll bet I haven't picked up more than 4kpp in the past 4 levels, 
and half of that was due to a little luck selling one of the spells I 
got via EP.  Generally, my bazaar efforts haven't yeilded many spell 
sales, despite putting them out at half what others are asking.

Ideas for cash camps:

Hill Giants (gonna be SOOO green to me now, but there's still a maximum 
number I can run down per hour, and I don't think we're looking at 
serious money).

Velks spiders; the velium stuff seems to sell well enough, 25pp apiece 
or so.  Trouble is, it doesn't drop -that- much, and roaming around on 
the little skinny ledges to find every spider is tedious and a bit 
dangerous.  I did Velks for several levels back before the mobs went 
green and never made a real fortune, not sure it will be all that much 
better now that I'm not even making exp off them.

Velks Village?  Is this mage soloable?  Are drops there worth money?

POJ P&E.  I tried this at 63 and it looked like good cash and exp, but 
it was very difficult due to getting stuck behind a pair of unmezzable 
(to me) mobs; my pet could only take both at once with significant luck. 
  Once I get Planar Renewal this might change.

LDoN's have only been fetching around 50pp per run, not even enough to 
keep me in KEI.  Similarly, camps like POV golems, HOH GY seem to yeild 
little or nothing.

What am I overlooking?  I need either mobs that are exp and cash and are 
single pullable, or I need mobs that are not exp but lots of cash and 
can be mowed down in large numbers quickly, or I need great group cash 
spots (because grouped I'll have to split the money)

I'd prefer NOT to be camping some spawn for a rare pop rare drop deal 
where I'd then end up with an item I can theoretically sell for mega 
plat, because I've found that such items can take a long time to move 
even selling at half what people say they are worth.  I'd rather get 
large amounts of something moderately valuable, heck, vendor sellable 
loot would be even better, which is why the P&E camp interests me, cash 
drops vendoring for up to 238pp.
