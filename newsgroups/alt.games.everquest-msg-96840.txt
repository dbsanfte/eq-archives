If they can figure out a reasonable way to do it and still not drag
people into unwilling PvP (and cut down the griefing) then I think
they'll do it.

Perhaps set it to one zone a day for a limited time period, then
everyone who logs in to do it logs into that zone. Along with a
warning about it beforehand so the players can vamoose if they don't
want any part of it.
