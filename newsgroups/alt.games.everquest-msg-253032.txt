Not really, takes more effort though.

Hmm comparing solo to grouping is pretty dumb really, considering the
changes to group exp.

And the best exp from fearkiting for a ranger is from dark blues, not
yellows or reds, if it was bad exp for you then I would say you were
slacking or in the wrong zones at the wrong times.

And yes, necros solo better and easier, whats new.

40 - 52 was very quick with my ranger, much faster than my shaman levelled
40-52 (much of it solo).

I have found with nearly any class I have played and solod, except at newbie
levels (1-20ish), dark blues are FAR better exp over time than yellows reds
etc.  This could be different for a necromancer however (though I doubt it
that much).
