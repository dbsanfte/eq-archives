Sadly, since the cleric is on Morel Thule (along with the 57 bard
and the 52 shaman, any one of whom could probably get the dire
wolf taken care of solo... did it with the cleric when the shaman
was 35 or so)  he won't be much help getting stuff on Firiona
Vie.  

I did love those boots though, and as you say, everything thru
the Mistmore part we can do ourselves, will only have to figure
out how to get some real power together to do that run to the
library and then the wolf.
