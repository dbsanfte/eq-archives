If one zone that has mobs that are 55-60 and hit for 160's and have
10k hp (UP) has a 90 ZEM, how is it balancing risk vs. reward for a
plane that has 55-60 mobs that hit for 260-350 and have 10k hp (PoN)
to have a ZEM of 85?  That's what they just changed it to. 

PoP xp is only easier if you can organize a group with the correct
classes.  It's not easier for me, my buddy and our friend to simply
get together and go hunting in pop, not without long setup times 
waiting on a slower and a true tank.

They said that duo xp was going to be approximately the same as it
was before the change.  Since duo xp got boosted by 6/5ths, then
the PoP ZEM has to be at least 5/6ths of the original value - that
means 5/6ths of 145 - so at least 121.  I'd say the extra damage
output, the need to get extra people of specific classes warrants
a 33% boost to the ZEM over UP.  The PoP zones should have been
brought to 120 - otherwise Jame's vision of 65's getting together
and owning huge chunks of old zone real estate is probably going
to come true.  It is what happened in FG prior to pop.
