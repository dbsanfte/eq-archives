Yes, which only takes a few seconds.

Then make two "/assist so-and-so" keys.

Yes, they should.  But that doesn't help during raids when
the MA may well not even be *in* your group.

...which is why I said you can use the key again "if necessary".
i.e., like "when they tell you to".

True, I didn't say it wouldn't be useful to have one of those
too, if you're of a class type which could actually do something
useful if you had targeted the person the mob was beating on
(like healer-types).

On the other hand, doing the "Fn + Assist-hotkey" is a two keystroke
operation, perhaps involving more than one hand, and I find my
fingers are often very busy handling other things during fights --
I'm more efficient with the "single key" setup.  The (very few)
times I need something more general, I can type "/ass" pretty
damned quickly.
