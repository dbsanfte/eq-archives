Ooooooh, no, my level 50 necro won't be able to
loot level 30 gear to give to my level 10 cleric... he'll
have to loot level 50 stuff to give him instead!

Also keep in mind, my level 50 necro didnt get there
by waving a magic wand over his exp bar, he leveled
his way up.  And I knew that the real purpose was
to get gear for my cleric.  So, I make sure to loot the
few "hard to find better" items while the necro is still
low enough to get them; say adamantine epaulettes
at what, 44?  TLC takes over when stuff is no longer
even exp green?    While hitting on blue/green mobs
to get yourself gear yields pretty crappy stuff, doing
so to get gear for your twink is pretty simple.

If you want to prevent twinking, make -more- items
no drop, not fewer!

Course that only raises the bar to "two computers and
two accounts" so that the twink to be can be present to
do the looting...
