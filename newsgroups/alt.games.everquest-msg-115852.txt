cool!!  (see, I really *am* a newbie)

last night a caster of some sort, hollered through the snowy peaks, that he
was going to group Aegnos (?) - I misunderstood that he was going to port
somewhere, so I thought - what the hey - I'm not quite leveled at ten, so
worst case, I die and come home...  belongings intact...

turns out he was casting a spell that super-buffs hit points!  I offered him
what little amount of gold I had and he flat-out refused.  With great
thanks, I headed to the tundra to "finally get me one of those mammoths!!"
G!

once arriving, my server or ISP dropped connection twice in a row, so I
ended up quitting for the night.  I hope I still have the buff when I get
there this evening!!  Very cool.

My experience has been that I get drive-by buffed and sow'd frequently -
I've never *asked* for it - on the other hand, I always offer whatever money
or semi-valuable loot I have.  Some take it, others refuse.

I also make sure to drop newbie junk (low armor, etc) to even newer/lower
level folk when I don't need it.  Karma?  Maybe, but I've not yet
encountered a 'beggar' or 'snooty druid'??  Maybe its just because us
Scandinavian-type folk way up in Halas are just more community oriented. G!
