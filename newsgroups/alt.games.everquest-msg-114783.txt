I was running down the ramp from HH in EK when I noticed, for the first
time, a mural carved into the stone wall near one of the bandit towers.  It
looked to me like a multi-limbed female(?) with a dog/wolf(?).  Has anyone
else seen this and what does it look like to you?  I wonder if there is a
way to find out who/what the artist was trying to represent?  Just curious.
