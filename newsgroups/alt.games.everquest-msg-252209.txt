I've seen this same quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin.

     "Uh, sir, why not go - well, go the limit? Require everyone to serve
and let everybody vote?"
     "Young man, can you restore my eyesight?"
     "Sir? Why, no, sir!"
     "You would find it much easier than to instill moral virtue - social
responsibility  -  into a person who doesn't have it, doesn't want it, and
resents having the burden  thrust on him. This is why we make it so hard to
enroll, so easy to resign. Social responsibility above the level of family,
or at most of tribe, requires imagination - devotion, loyalty, all the
higher virtues - which a man must develop himself; if he has them forced
down him, he will vomit them out."

Heinlein, of course.
