Ha, I have a commemorative coin, drank the free beer and ate the party cake, 
and my baby lizard beastlord is running around with a Festive Doll in her 
off-claw (she can't dual wield yet and I've yet to find anything else to put 
there, and anyway it looks cute!).  She thinks it's lucky.  She also chews on 
it.
