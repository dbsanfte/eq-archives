A further FYI:  Icewell is for those 50+.  If you go in, especially alone,
below that, expect to lose 3 levels trying to get your corpse out.

Losing 3 levels...that's got to be at least 15 deaths...you didn't think
that after, say, the TENTH time you died that perhaps it might be a good
idea to call it quits until you could find people to help?  Perhaps
guildmates?
