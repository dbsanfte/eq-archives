So, if I click on melee, my character attacks with ready melee
weapon, and then if I click again, but this time on ready ranged
weapon, my character will use the ranged weapon ? Or must I stop
autoattack first ?

It would be interesting if a character could stand, say on the
parapets near the gate at Freeport, and use a bow to attack
monsters. Of course, I would have to wonder if the monster would
then try to reach the character on the parapet. I'll try it out this
weekend.
