Do the trade commissioner quest.

Do the mistala (forget first name, some human lady) quest to deliver
the note to the guy in dawnshroud (basically you go west to the zone
to sanctus seru (two legionares outside it.. indiff to all it seems,
even my troll sk of cazic) and then you continue to the left when
facing the legos along the zone wall and the guy you give the note to
is a ways down.. with some npcs in tents in front of him a ways. This
quest raises several factions.

Another quest is the erud guy in the casters guild area of shadow
haven wants a rock. It drops in paludral off some kind of burrower
(forget type but people in the zone will tell you usually) giving him
the rock raises traders of haven and the merchant/caster faction there
too.

I found doing all 3 of those now and again nicely raised my factions
for shadow haven without getting burnt out doing the same quest over
and over.
