I try not to walk into things blind.  I know what's involved, I was just
wondering if there was a tradeskill that I should start working on now. 
You're talking to someone who got smithing to 183 in one day.  (On a
different character, on a different server, of course.)  I'm going to
work on tradeskills either now or later.  My question wasn't whether or
not I should, it was which one.
