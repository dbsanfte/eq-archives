Word of Pain is the first in the Clerical line of Area Effect spells.  It is
not an upgrade to Furor.  At level 9, you should be seeing WoPain do
something like 24 points of damage to each attackable monster within a
certain radius around you.

It's a really efficient way to kill, say, a whole bunch of decaying
skeletons, fire beetles, and gnoll pups that might just happen to be grouped
around you.

It might also be an efficient way to get yourself killed if you're too close
to a guard when you cast it.

In PvP, it can also be effective in discovering an invisible or disguised
spy from another team who might be nearby (your teammates would be
protected...an enemy, however...."Gee, why did that tree just take damage
and writhe in pain?")  I've also seen Word of Pain work against higher level
players who were able to resist all my other offensive spells.
