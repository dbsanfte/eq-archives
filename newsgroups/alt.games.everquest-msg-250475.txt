I think i heard the minimum number of people you need for an ldon is 3. Is 
this correct?  I've currently started 3 boxing and wanted some advice from 
anyone who has done this before.  I've got a Paladin, Shaman, and Wizard.  
They are all in their mid 20s.  When you get an adventure is it the same kind 
with 3 people that you would get if you had 6?  Or do they scale back the 
difficulty a bit because you have fewer people?
