If you are patient and work upsome more cash you may find a "Whip of
Strangulation" around.  I got mine for 400PP.  I know this is quite
a bit more than you have and I have been told this is cheap for this
weapon (I have no idea if I got a deal or paid to much).  WoS is 6
24 and does 20 DD and a 60 DOT over 30 seconds.  Procs at all levels
(even level 1 I have been told).

I have this and a Crystal Fiber myself (though I use a SSOY a lot
too) for mele on my Bard many times because of range.   Lots of
times I can be by casteres singing mana song and still reach the
target with the longer range of the whips.
