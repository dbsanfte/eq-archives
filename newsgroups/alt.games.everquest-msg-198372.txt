Keep in mind this is from a 65 druid w/ 55 aa.

Get 60, the most aa before that should be run3 if you spend time indoors.
At 60, unless you're being powered to 65 in tier 2 pop, stay and aa for a
while.

run3 is a must for everybody
regen3 or metabolism3 to finish off required general skill, stay away from
innate wis, it's useless.
Spell Casting Mastery 3 in archetype to unlock class skills, stay away from
Mental Clarity beyond level 1, until you're in the 150+ aa range.  SCM
scales with aa spent on it (since arch skills are 2/4/6 cost), MC does not.
Exodus and innate camo are extremely useful skills in class
Dire charm is a fun toy, but it's not super useful
MGB is useful in conjunction with spirit of the wood (pop aa) if you raid a
lot.
Radiant cure is also useful to get.
Natural Durability owns, more hp are good
Spell Casting Fury/Fury of Magic are nice if you nuke a lot

Stay away from Enhanced root, Mental Clarity 2 or 3 and Wrath of the Wild
until much farther along in your aa.
