I know that you can increase the hotkey bank to 10 keys showing by going to
fullscreen (that's how I play anyway), and that's NOT what I'm asking about.
When I click on 'abilities' there appears 6 slots that I can click on and
choose from among my abilities.  Then I can drag from that slot and drop
into my bank of 10 hotkeys.  But I have more than 6 abilities that I want to
hotkey.  I tried using the socials, but /doability 6 does the slot 6 hotkey
so I still cannot /doability 7.  I now have 6 abilities hotkeyed and 2
combat abilities hotkeyed.  Is there any way to hotkey my 7th ability?
