I wanna say 29 is the first dual-weilding enchanter pet, but I'm not sure.  
There may be some value in giving a high-damage weapon to lower level 
pets, but a high enough damage weapon to make a significant difference 
-generally- costs too much.  Delay is functionally irrelevant for pet 
weapons.  Note the damage on the weapon, and note the maximum damage your 
pet hits for over a couple minutes.  See if the maximum damage goes up 
after you give him a weapon of damage X.  If it doesn't, all weapons 
damage X or below will function the same for the pet, so you may as well 
use rusty daggers.

If you have a dual-weilding pet, it is very worth giving him two rusty 
daggers, as he will then swing much more often.  The very highest 
enchanter pets seem to be summoned with two weapons equipped, however.

Also, if you give the pet procing weapons, the pet will use them provided 
the pet is high enough level to activate the proc.  Velium weapons and 
Gnoll-Hide Lariats are among the best choices in this regard.

>What about other pet gear,is it worth it at low levels?

It can be, if you use enough of it.  The mage haste muzzle makes the most 
difference.  Much of the other mage gear provides a fair amount of 
additional hit points.  The belt provides a good plus to dex as well, 
which will help the pet proc more frequently if they have a procing 
weapon.  Even just raw AC can help, though.  When fighting in areas that 
mobs drop armor I would otherwise let rot, like mistmoore or unrest, 
giving it to the pet instead has made a noticeable difference.  Just don't 
give the pet a shield if it has the potential to dual wield, until after 
you've given it two weapons. :) (Some shields go in the back slot, like 
the mage Elemental Defender, provided you fill the secondary slot first.)

>And how do I find no rent weapons and gear in

Basically, by searching on the name of the item you're looking for.  There 
should be a better way, but there isn't.

I usually use that technique when the current pet is getting old, the 
level before I get a new one. If I have a new pet in the last level or 
two, it's usually better to let the pet tank, and use Berzerker 
Strength / Berzerker Spirit / Rampage or whichever I've got atm to 'heal'.

Slow is the crucial debuff... I'd save your mana on casting the others, 
and maybe throw a nuke or two.  Tash if you need it to get slow on, 
though. :)

>My goal is to make him 49 for the enchant spells.

Around level 30-35, pet soloing is going to be much less efficient than 
getting a good group.  No reason to stop pet soloing while you look for 
one, though. :)
