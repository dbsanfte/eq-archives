I bought a geforce 400 mx for 75 bucks and didn't like it very well
with any game it ran on, 1 week later I purchased a radeon 8500 (OEM)
for 200 bucks and so far it rocks with the direct x 8.1 enabled
drivers. 

Keep in mind that the Geforce MX chip is the cheapo version and the
GTS chip should blow its nuts off.
