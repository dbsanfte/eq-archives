Why this is just now appearing on my server when it's dated the 7th, I
don't know...but....

Yes, there are higher level mobs that drop chips. BUT, they are most
plentiful in newbie grounds. At the rate some higher necros chew
through chips, killing at your level won't sustain the supply.

And if the quest reason is really why they don't sell chips, why not
make necro pets require something different? Or change the damn
quests.
