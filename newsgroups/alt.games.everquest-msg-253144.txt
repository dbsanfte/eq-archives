I think you meant 52, not 42.

I think your frustration is stemming from two misconceptions:

1. Casters *always* have KEI up (or C2/C1 if they're not high enough).

  This isn't true.  The Plane of Knowledge (and the Nexus before
  it) made it very easy to get KEI, but there are still situations
  where your group might not have it.  Someone dies and gets rezzed,
  KEI gets dispelled by a caster mob, or you're in a long camp in
  a remote zone and KEI simply wears off.  In all of these situations,
  your ability to cast C1/C2 suddenly becomes useful again.

2. All spells are carefully designed to fit into a logical, balanced
   framework.

  This isn't necessarily true either.  When the game first opened,
  C1 was the only spell of its kind.  Breeze and C2 were added
  later, KEI was added after that, and so on.  If all of these
  spells had existed from the very first, they would probably be
  well-balanced with respect to each other.  But they weren't.
  
> Why can't chanters cast c2 and KEI at the lower levels?

Because they're powerful, high-level spells.  That's kinda like asking
why a L10 wizard can't cast Ice Comet...
