That seems deliberately difficult for the purpose of making a point -

Basic hotkey
/stopsong
/pause 3
/cast #

Get gear with instrument mods on them (at the level of a ranger
using a 250k bow and all the melee using post epic gear, this is 
not out of line)

Now it becomes
Hotkey 1 (4 count)
Hotkey 2 (4 count)
Hotkey 3 (4 count)

Because of our lack of bards we have 2 guildies bring up alts -
we don't expect getting them their epic to be terribly tough.
