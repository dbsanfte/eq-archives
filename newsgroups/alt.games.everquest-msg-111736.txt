    It isn't as hot as you'd think. Necromancers have reported it only seems
to work on "Chunk of Meat" and one other kind of meat summoned by a scythe
that drops off a mid-end mob (it's a proc). Since "Chunk of Meat" also
doesn't drop in high-end zones, it turns out to be fairly worthless. With
the scythe, though, it's not so bad - take a few swipes at something, get
some meat, make bone chips.

    It is if you don't have the scythe, as you'll still be looking for stuff
off lowbie mobs and vendors.
