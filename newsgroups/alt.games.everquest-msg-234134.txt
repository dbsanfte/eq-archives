It's a staff with +5 to all saves and +10hp/mana/end, and a faction
modifier, according to EB Games
(http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/240960.asp).

You also get a miniature of the staff in the box.

As for downloading, I had started downloading before I decided to
pre-order online, so I'd have it available immediately without
worrying about installing it from CD (especially annoying as my CD-ROM
drive is getting increasingly decrepit).
