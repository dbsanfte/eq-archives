I can't speak for high level druids, but my shaman gave up melee a long time
ago.  Root and Rot is the way to go.  I can root and rot several blues in a
row with no downtime in between.  I have recently found (level 49) that my
pet can be quite effective now.  I have been able to pull and kill Freeport
Militia (lt blue, dk blue, some greens) nonstop to my pet, and have him kill
them with just the occasional heal.  I keep my pet fully buffed, and slow
the Militia.  The only time I do any melee any more is when a mob is
running, and that is rare because I am forced to realize at that point just
how much my melee sucks.
