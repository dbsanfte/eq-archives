It was never survival of the STRONGEST or the dinosaurs woould still
be here.  It is survival of the fittest, but not in the sense of the
one with the best strength, intelligence, or health.  

It is rather survival of the fittest in the sense of that which best
fits in the environment.  A strong helathy shark doesn't survive in an
environment in which it doesn't fit (e.g. a freshwater river, a
forest, or an ocean with no other marine life); it can survive quite
well in the proper environment (e.g. saltwater ocean with other fish
to feed on).  The freshwater fish dies in the ocean because it doesn't
fit the environment.  

Fit in, you survive despite flaws.  The eskimo adapts to fit life in a
desert or he dies; does not matter how STRONG he is.  He may fit
better in a cold environment because of body adaptions, but he can
survive in a desert by fitting the environment.  Neanderthals were
stronger than modern humans, but they aren't here any longer.  The
environment changed and the Neanderthal didn't fit in the new
environment, an environment that included modern humans, as well as
the modern humans fit into an environment that included Neanderthals.
The environment was changed by those humans too.  Fit in to survive
and that includes fitting in with the other living things already
there and the new ones that move in.  The more environments into which
one species can fit, the better that one's survival, unless something
else fits in better and/or in more places.
