One would think so.  This type of group drop is the norm in DAOC, where 
anyone doing the same quest can group and get the same drop.  I never had 
a problem with that, though admittedly it was very rare that I met anyone 
at a drop point, I assume due to the number of varied quests for the 
differnt classes. 

One hopes this is just an anomally that will pass after the first two or 
three days of release.
