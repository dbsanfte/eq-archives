The usual: sow+invis. levitate can be good for hopping the peaks and being
too high for things to agro. maybe put your gear in the bank in cabilis, and
pick it up at bazaar. Id get a bind in shodowhaven at the soulbinder so you
dont have to repeat the run if you die.Most of the people in DL hang around
the north wall of karnors castle and the ruins to its east. This is just
south of the fm zone, and its safe from wandering mobs. You should be able
to get inv/sow/levi if you ask enough people. Money talks of course, but off
course you could just buy a port with money. Last port my cleric bought was
from FM to combines ring cos I'd sonner pay 20p than risk having some spider
agro on me. fm is a good place to get cheap ports, as druids therre are just
getting their port spells.

I believe the "safe point" of DL is near the combine rings, so another
option would be to get extremely damaged with a hp buff on, and zone into
DL. Not sure if verant would consider this exploiting a bug, but it will
almost certainly go unnoticed. I call it the poor mans succor.
