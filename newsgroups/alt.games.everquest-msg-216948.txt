    Well, I can't imagine sneering at anyone over such a thing. The post was
meant as a "I can't believe Sony have taken you in on this one". I can't
remember how much they reported making on character transfers, but it was a
lot, and they're obviously charging way over cost for the service. The
entire process could be completely automated, and if it hasn't been yet,
that's their decision. I would say to guess the personal service frontend
supports any claims they want to make about the process being involved and
complicated.

    Not that I think there's anything particularly wrong with that.

Cheers,
James
