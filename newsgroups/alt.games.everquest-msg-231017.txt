One of my favorite sights can be seen as a druid or if you have someone nice
enough to lay  a levitate spell on you. Head to the spires in Karana,
Levitate, sit on top of the spires and look down when the portal activates,
pretty cool light show. I also think alot of the background work ie. scenery
is underappreciated it is a small part that makes the whole package that
much better.
