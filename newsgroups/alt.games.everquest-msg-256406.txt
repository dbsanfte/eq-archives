Working on my first step of epic, I had to do about two solid hours of 
throwing.  On the plus side, that took me from 194 skill to 215 skill, 
only 5 to go to cap out till level 51.

But other discoveries ensued.

One: With one thrower in range slot and a different one in ammo slot, 
the ammo slot ones get used.

Two: If you run down on the item in the ammo slot so you only have one 
left there, but have more in inventory, you'll use the inventory ones 
till they run out, then the last one in ammo, and only then switch to 
the range slot ones.

Three: If the item in the range slot has a proc, it will proc on use 
even though you are using up the ones in the ammo slot.

Four: You won't, though, be using the range, damage, delay, or any 
damage bonus of the range slot item, those would all come from the ammo item

Five: Haste items and cast haste both seem to boost throw speed, 
although since you have to click every time to throw, you start to run 
into the human reaction time limit, so there are diminishing returns

So, now I'm looking for proccing items which are throwable or at any 
rate fit in the range slot for a barbarian berserker, speed, range, etc 
are no object

At the moment I'm proud owner of three axes that proc a single disease 
counter removal effect per throw, I'm not sure there are any mobs where 
something good will happen if I cure them, but heck, I've got the things!
