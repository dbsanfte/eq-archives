You could try getting yourself a healing partner and heading to the
warrens. You can bind right outside in Paineel, and once you kill enough
of the critters in there to get amiable to the Paineel folks, you can
get a key and go in and use their city for banking, merchants, etc.
Place is usually completely empty, too, so the hunting will be
plentiful.
