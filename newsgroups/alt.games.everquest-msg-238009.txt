I wouldn't worry about being shot.

Lag is a perfectly legitmate term to describe the effect, its just not
the technical source of the problem.

For what its worth "lag" isn't a technical problem at all. It is
itself a catch-all for high latency, data transmission errors, breif
network interruptions (e.g. reseting/rebooting a router between you
and the server or a  major  traffic burst hitting one of the routers
between you and the server) or insufficient bandwidth, along with
relatively unquantifiable server cpu load issues . All of which are
unrelated to each other and all of which can cause your computer to
lose its normal 'almost real-time sync' with the server.

The result of most normal 'lag' that I've experienced in EQ is
probably the kind induced by the brief network interruptions.
