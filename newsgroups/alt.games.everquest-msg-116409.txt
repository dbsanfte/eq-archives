None. Dex is only how fast you learn offensive skills, as in skilling
up. You get to max skill with a melee weapon at about the same speed
whether you have 73 dex or 115. Its really worthless for most things
and you probably won't even notice much of a difference in proccing.

As a warrior you can be concerned with:

1) Ac
2) HP
3) Sta (Due to it being HP, 100 means you don't slow weapon speed when
fatigued.)
4) Agil being at least 75 or more

Nothing else matters at all. In a stat explanation post long ago brad
mcquaid explained what the stats do and why they really matter so
little, they did it so that huge stats on armor or rather "twinking"
would really have little to no effect.  As a warrior the only stat
which will help you besides AC and HP on armor is stamina.
