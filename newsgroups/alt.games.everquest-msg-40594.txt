: Im level 36 right now. Whats a good place to level up?

Without doubt, The Overthere. Reasons:
1) lots of mobs, good exp
2) all mobs are "loners", meaning it's hard to accidentally pull more than one
3) lots of people in zone to group with
4) evil races can loot braids from sarnak corpses and turn them in for even
more exp - reportedly around half a blue for every 4 braids at your level.

The downsides:
1) dragoons, level 50-60, are aggie to good races - but can be avoided
2) good races need to travel a couple of zones to sell and bank
3) loot is really pathetic, except for cockatrices who drop a few plat

But in conclusion, in Overthere my cleric levelled from 28 to 36 in about 
a week, while only dying twice. Then it was down to Guk for more exp AND loot
to replace the equipment I'd grown out of when levelling like mad =)
