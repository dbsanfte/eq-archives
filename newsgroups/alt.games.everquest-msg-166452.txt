My husband is a shaman, and has recently attained 170 alchemy skill at
level 58.  While he is very dutiful in raising it each level, and has
funnelled approximately 20-30k into it, he is not very enthusiastic about
the usefulness of potions.  Certainly he will never recoup 20-30k worth of
profits from selling SOW potions or other trinkets.  

He does take satisfaction, however, from passing out free Grow potiosn to
all his halfling, dwarf, and gnome friends and hearing back later about
the fun they had with them in groups.  And the resistence and DS potions
have been handy in select cases.

As an observer I would say...never do alchemy for money, or you'll lose
your sanity.  Do it when you have lots of money to throw away and want it
for pride and fun.  There are very few potions in existence whose value
matches the immediate cost and the skill up cost, which is why you'll not
be able to become a rich man doing it.

Have fun with it, though? Aye, I think you could quite easily. :)
