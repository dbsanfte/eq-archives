Buyable.  I know the monk guild in Freeport carries em, and I can't 
think off-hand who else does, because that's usually where I end up 
grabbing mine on the way by.  They don't break or get used up.

> And why "never EVER" put them in the bank?

Because that's exactly when you'll need them.  And you'd think I'd 
learn, but last night I had to get into The Hole to help a friend, got 
all the way there, and realized I'd destroyed them to make room for some 
more fine steel during the whole Grobb/Gukta war >_<  Bad, bad rogue.
