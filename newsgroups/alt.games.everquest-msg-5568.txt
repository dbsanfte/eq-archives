Do myn eyes deceive me ? How has this Sundry of ill repute gone unquenched
by the fires of myn hands .  Avenger , thou hath scurried whence thou  came
to desecrate  hallowed walls .  Not only thus ,  but hath spelled  fine
maiden , Princess of Thunder  !! Begone !!! Begone I say !!!         Worry
not fine maiden thy virtues shall be restored . By the gods Avenger!! . hath
thee no shame ?? To put a flower so delicate , with sweetness of honey , to
such horror as to make her motley to jester thy court !!!! Thou shall rue
this day !!!       I see thy squire Getsum hath  fallen to thy evil ways . I
cannot save one that has not virtues from whence thou first come forth ,
though tis a loss , I shall leave thee behind .    Sword , thee have
strolled thine fence to long my son .  Tis time to make thine choice of
wills .  I fear thine heart be  marked from soot but I assure to thee, I
shall be merciful for punishment if only thou wolde forbear this collection
of ill repute, and come forth to light of all that is good .
Although these halls hath yet to prove its worthiness  ,  I shall set away
its insecurities of manhood , and proposed virtues of thy sweet bosom , and
relegate  thes fools and harlots both to Norath of Old  . I know not why
thus compels me so ,  to rid halls so tarnished by trees that clearing of
brush would be for not . I fear thou might persuade me  , when confronted by
such a lot .  But alas for now I shall endure thes unpleasantries for I have
been summoned by thine master of souls .

 I give thee warnian so thee may flee or face thy own demise from inelegant
speech .

Darrius
