I know my surname removal did NOT take the senior GM on our server.  I can't 
remember if it was a guide or a GM who did it, though the first person to 
respond was an apprentice guide, who was unable to make the change for me.  If 
the person is level 20, they're an apprentice guide, and can't do much.  If 
they're 50-54, they are a full guide, with higher level indicating higher 
seniority.  I *think* any full guide can remove and/or change the surname.  I 
know any GM can.
