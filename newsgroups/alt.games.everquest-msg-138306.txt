Also, ANY dark elf in the house can drop the Kedge and/or Ishva robe.  I've
been on raids where none dropped any, and one where 3 separate DE's
(none of them the Coercer, btw) dropped a Kedge robe while just clearing
the house.

Leave ONE inky up (I recommend Brigadier G'Tav), and you can do as Tim
says...spawn one General one after another until all participating rogues
either wipe or get their pouches...then kill the last DE just to check for
robes on that one, too.

Also, some of V'Ghera's loot isn't bad...my alt is DWing her epic with
the Edge of the Nightwalker that he dropped (14/25, +8 to melee stats)
during one raid for a friend.  The general rule is that the rogue that
spawned
the General (and there were 9 the night Aliani did hers...with 90 people
showing up to help...it's good to have friends, but thank God some
weren't offended by "I think we can handle it now, I'll give you a /tell to
let you know how it went!!!" :-)  ) gets the pouch and if he's lucky, the
quill, but nobody rolls on a quill.  Your General drops it, you get it.  But
it's crass to want to be in on a loot role for any other loot he drops.

BTW, camp a lowbie SK near the place the raid will fight.  V'Ghera drops
a NICE SK-only no drop shield, that usually ends up rotting after about
the first one or two.  Looks spiffy on a Gnome, too...
