Druid, hands down. Nothing gives you the best * balance * of spells for
PLing:

* ac/hp buff
* hp/mana regeneration
* damage shields
* strength that only a shaman can buff better, for when you are PLing a
higher level character and want to be able to hit harder
* healing that is only bettered by a cleric, and cleric healing abilities
are most effective when healing a character close to their own level anyway
* wolf form for ATK buff
* port anywhere to get you to the best mobs/camps
* when pling at close to their own level, can solo adds so you don't get
your ass smeared while the PLer looks on helplessly
* buff all resists, not just some
* cure disease/poison and remove curse
* various and sundry other abilities like tracking and harmony

P.S.: Why do you think everyone and their dog has a druid alt? To PL all
their other characters and earn the money to equip their tired and worn
hides. 8P
