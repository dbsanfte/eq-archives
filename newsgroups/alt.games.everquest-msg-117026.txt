I had never realized how bad human vision is until I upgraded from my 
Tranix Crown to a Kael quest helm.  As an elf, I have infravision, and my 
basic iksar, dark elf, and werewolf illusions always had infra- or 
ultra-vision, and I had infravision on the Tranix crown, so I never had to 
suffer.  Now that my crown is bank detrius, I've gotten myself lost and 
stuck several times in Erudite form.  I take back any bitching I may have 
done about humans whining about nightblindness.
