Yes, online price guides are not accurate. They rely on 2 things that cannot
be relied on :ï¿½) The constant updates by posters and the honesty of posters.
I think the large dragon bone shard is about the 3-4k mark on Bristlebane,
maybe less now. Seen the Jagged Blade for under 3k on a few occasions and
that is the better weapon of the 2.
