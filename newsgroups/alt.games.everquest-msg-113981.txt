Despite writing to Everquest to cancel my subscrition in March,
Everquest went on to charge my Mastercard account for further three
months.

On Complaining and posting them another copy of my cancellation
letter/email,I have been told it is Everquest's policy not to refund
any money once taken out from your account. I have written to
Mastercard but not sure if they can help..

Hope the others would learn from my experience Never to Trust
Everquest with your credit card details..
