There are items that grant infervision but not sure on ultravision if you
are a Enchanter the Dark Elf illusion has the ultravision effect at lev 8 or
they gey the spell at 29. Shamans can also cast ultravision at level 29.
The nice side effect with the coldstone is it has a 5 ac with it most mages
will be happy to summon a player a coldstone free of charge if you are
polite and ask nicely. This is a nice trick to have a supply of them that
wont poof at log off. Pay a mage to summon you several coldstones place them
in inventory slots not in bags or containers at your bind or close to it
duel someone and have them kill you loot everything but the coldstones they
will stay on your corpse for 7 days or 24 hours of online game time. Loot as
needed.
