My advice is to not waste your time on the practice research, it's likely
still broken.  If you want to raise the skill, put training points into it.
If you just want your spells, either buy them in the bazaar or gather up the
words and ask for someone with high research skill to combine for you.
Also, if you are going to do the research yourself, pick up either a Geerlok
Automated Quill or a Thought Horror Scalp.  Either of those will add a +5%
modifier to your research skill, but they will not stack.
