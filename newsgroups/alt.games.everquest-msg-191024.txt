A good 2GHz system with 512MB of DDR or RDRAM with a GF4 Ti 4600/Radeon 9500
or better, with the right settings, can run at 10 or more fps. While this is
not great, it is certainly decent when you are not in a "life or death"
situation for your character.

Using F9 is also a huge help, and it is a great way to go skidding around
the bazaar looking for 300 spiderling silks or whatever you need.
