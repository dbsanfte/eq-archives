Yesterday I noticed a necro following me around as I rushed back
to rejoin my group after a disaster.  Thought perhaps he was joining
us or something, but really wasn't paying much attention.

Resed one guy, and he pumped me up with mana, which allowed
me to res the second one pretty quickly.

After a bit, a party member asked if I was resing the necro.  Hmm.
He hadn't said a word.  Looked around, and sure enough there was
his nearly naked body.  How odd.  I commented on that and the
group said that no, he'd been asking, offering money in say.  Got an idea..
checked my ignore list and there he was.

Well, I have no idea how he got there, I haven't put anyone on ignore
since I was in my 20s in LOIO... and only six people there all told!

Note to the world at large, don't annoy clerics, you might need them
some day when they grow up.
