Its not your PC its a memory 'leak' not sure how to explain it but the game
progressivley starts using more and more memory and when it is supposed to
let go of some of the memory it won't and when it starts using more RAM than
you have it will start writing to the HD and thats when the noise starts.
Someone more knowledgable can explain it better than me.  Basically its
laziness on the SOE programmers part, they should have done a better job
