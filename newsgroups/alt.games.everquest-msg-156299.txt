It is possible to see the high end content and still have a life. My
guild raids ntov, ssra, just got our first aow kill last week, and we
take under 60's, (51 is too low, but it doesnt hurt to start showing
interest early). Two thirds of my guild is comprised of casual
players. True, the very highest end (Vex Thal) is still out of reach
and by the time we get there the two guilds on my server currently
there will probably have abandoned it, but thats plenty good enough
for me. On my server there are probaby about five ntov capable guilds
that don't require to raid 24/7.
