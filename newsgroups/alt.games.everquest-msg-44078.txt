I can think of a few spots off hand you can go to for xp and loot. 
Mammoths in everfrost whose tusks will sell for 7-10pp depending on
faction/charisma.  Should be mostly blue to you at 29, but still decent
experience.  at around 165 wis my druid has been able to take on two
usually before needing to med up.  Snare/ensnare, fear, dot, melee, fear
as needed, for the last couple levels.  AT 30 now I could probably do
three, but due to resist worries i usually sit to med at around two bubs
of mana.  Another camp spot in Everfrost is the Icy orcs, which are good
experience for several more levels yet.  Good for a group experience
grind, and they sometimes drop fine steel weapons.  Can be soloed, but
efficiency of course drops.  To solo, Harmony and single pull, watch out
for Redwind, he is a shadow knight with a nasty harm touch as his
opening move.  The last place off the top of my head is Hill giants in
Rathe Mtns.  at 29 You will need to be in a group, but the cash is
excellent.  Ideally to get the several thousand pp that people are
spending on items, comes from dungeon hunting as well.  You get a decent
item and sell/trade it and keep selling high buying low, till you can
get the item you want via trade or cash.
