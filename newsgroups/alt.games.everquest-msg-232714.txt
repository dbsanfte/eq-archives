No, stick with it  :)  I have the same race and class as you, and am
more than happy.   STR-boosting items are relatively cheap and
plentiful in the Bazaar.  A couple of orc Fang Earrings will add 6 to
your STR for not a lot (I think I got a pair for 60 plat), add a Centi
Warhammer for another 3 STR (150 plat, if memory serves) and just keep
looking for more.  My lvl 18 High Elf Cleric has a STR of 92 now, what
with the above items and the odd bits of STR-boosting armour I saved
for  :))

Oh, always grab those frost giant beard things (usually 20 or so plat
in the Bazaar) as they cast Storm Strength for about a 30 minute
duration and have 2 or 3 charges.  I always shop for them whenever I
can, but the only shame is that a character can't own more than 1 at a
time  :(

Weight-reducing bags are handy, and a Rallic Pack is dandy if you can
get one. I bought the skin required in the bazaar for the bargain
price of 50 plat, and a guildie kindly got me the pattern & threads
free, then made it for me.  Failing that, you could always donate for
some summoned, 100% weight-reduction bags off a mage or shaman, but
bear in mind they vanish 30 minutes after you log off... or 30 minutes
after a server crash/shutdown!!!  Always sell and/or bank regularly
and you'll find these bags are WONDERFUL things!  I love them.

...and remember, we may be weak, physically, but we ARE the best
looking race out there  ;)
