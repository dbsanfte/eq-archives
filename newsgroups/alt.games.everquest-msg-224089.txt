I have to admit that I got nervous about working on my Shaman Epic after
reading the accounts here from Pirg and The Other Shane, but I went ahead
and made plans to kill the Dire Wolf this morning to obtain his pelt as the
next step in my Epic.

I managed to secure a pickup group consisting of a 54 pally, a 50 pally and
a 47 Mage (I am 52 Shaman) and I thought it would be a piece of cake. We
took out The Advisor easily (the PH that spawns the Dire Wolf, a spawn which
only stays up for 35 minutes), clearing all of the greenish yard trash
leading up to him (he conned LB to me) and then made our way systematically
to the DW, taking everything out in the process. The problem was a nearby
Huntress. We cleared her and her pet, but she apparently has a very quick
repop.

The DW conned DB to me and the 57 Pally, and his entourage of blood wolves
conned LB to us. The smaller wolves perished easily but the DW, he fought
proudly. I managed to land a slow and as we pounded away. Unfortunately, our
50 Paladin got a little sloppy and she accidentally got in aggro range of
the re-spawned Huntress we had cleared on the way. The Huntress jumped in
with her pet and  pushed things very much in the wrong direction. The mage
died quickly, root failed, and suddenly I had a Huntress and her pet on me
and we could see that the tide was turning against us and we were going
down.

I wasn't about to give up on DW, having gone that far, I fought like hell to
keep the heals and Stoicism on the tank, but alas I could not keep up and as
everyone started to go down it was obvious we were not going to make it and
one by one we all dropped. With my last bit of mana I landed a DoT on the DW
and started my march of death figuring I would try it again some other time.
Incredibly, the DW was very near death and the DoT kept ticking away and I
thought "If only I can survive long enough see him drop and then loot him" .
Well, he dropped alright and somehow I managed to avoid getting hit long
enough to get to the DW's corpse, loot it, and then watch in stunning
disbelief the LOADING, PLEASE WAIT ...

I'm still amazed and grateful that a group of strangers were willing to jump
in and help me achieve this milestone. I thanked all of them and then
dragged each of their corpses back to the zone line and secure rezzes for
them. I lost my level in the process (I had just dinged 52 last night) but
you know, experience comes easily. Adventures like this are rare and
precious. After all was said and done, I'm now the proud owner of Black Fur
Boots (essentially jboots with good resist stats) and one step closer to my
Epic ...
