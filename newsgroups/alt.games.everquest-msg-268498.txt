EQ2 isn't boring, it has plenty to do.  Though, you get bored with one toon,
you can only make three more per account...  It's just annoying.

Took me four days of camping, 3hours of exp debt, just to finish the
level 20 fury druid subclass quest.  very annoying.

When you level, you're gimped until you gather enough money to upgrade
your spells or skills.

Every death degrades your equipment 10% plus you have to pay to have EVERY
piece repaired.  And when an idiot group member dies, you share their
exp debt.  And multiple missing shards leaves you so weak, and for so
many days... Agan, annoying.

Graphics may be fine, but you lag horibbly due to it in group play.
Annoying, annoying, annoying.

Annoyed.
