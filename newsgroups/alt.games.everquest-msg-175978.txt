Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. It's a bug.

Make sure you're targetting the NPC when you try to talk to them. Repeat
the bracketed words back to them, making sure you adjust for necessary
tense changes and I/you substitution. Try "What XXX" or "What about XXX".

Check out <www.allakhazam.com> to see if the quest text is hosed :) There's
several places in the game where the NPC says "shoes" but is looking for
"shose", or says "shoes" but is looking for "sandals".


>Where can I find a sharpening stone ?

Qeynos, alas, doesn't have them. Your nearest sharpening stone vendors are
in Erudin, Halas, or Plane of Knowledge.  <www.eqtraders.com> is your
friend.

Shoot mobs. Preferably non-green ones. Pick up cheap arrows in Blackburrow,
folks often just let them rot. Snare a mob and run backwards firing arrows
at it until it drops. Root a mob and just plink arrows at it until it
drops, rerooting as necessary. Increase your DEX to improve your chances
of learning.


>Sometimes I get spell interrupted when I am standing perfectly still ?

Typically because you haven't *quite* come to a stop yet. If you're moving
and want to cast a spell, take your finger off the "forward" key and turn,
just slightly, to the left or right. This will help force you to be
motionless enough to cast spells.

There's also a few spots where "bad geometry" makes the game think you're
moving. Oh well.
