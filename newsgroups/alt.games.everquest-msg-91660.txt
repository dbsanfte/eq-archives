Well, considering he's only blue to lvl 60's, I don't think that
qualifies as *that* much of an undercon. ;-)

I think of undercons much more in terms of the different colors of con
message <plus> the difference in levels. In your mid to late fifties,
there's nothing full blue that you should be able to solo. (Necros and
druids, please cover your ears) Something one level below you being
tough shouldn't be a surprise. But then again, something blue that
regularly wipes out tier two guilds with experienced raid parties.....
yeah, from that perspective I guess he's still a bit of an undercon. :-)

But I'm still voting for the widowmistress. That bitch is lethal.
