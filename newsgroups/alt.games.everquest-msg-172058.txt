There's a reason that more than half of my Paladin's xp from 40 to 55
has come solo.  Pickup groups are, more often than not, the pits.

Sadly, even in cases where this makes sense all you're likely to do is
offend the Bard, who will go off and swarm kite giants or something.

Kaev is my only char above 38, he's 55.  My biggest problem is that I
rarely am able to set aside a block of time where I won't be interrupted
by RL events.  This results in either (a) I'm having to repeatedly
apologize for brief AFKs to deal with whatever deviltry my children are
cooking up at the moment, or more likely (b) I just don't even try to
get into groups.  While guildmates have on several occasions been very
understanding, it just feels wrong to be asking them to put up with it.
I can have uninterrupted time late at night, but by then oportunities
to join guildmates have pretty much evaporated, so I can either solo or
try to get into a pickup group, which works maybe one try in three.  I
find sitting around for hours LFG utterly unentertaining, so I've pretty
much given up on that.  I'm hoping this thing we've got going on Test
works out, the dedicated one night/week idea has allowed me to make
arrangements so that most Monday nights will be free of RL distractions.
I may finally get the opportunity to group and/or raid regularly with
the same group of people, which should be a lot of fun.
