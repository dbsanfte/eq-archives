Read somewhere that Verants official reason for stats having next to no
noticeable effect, in most cases, came from the fact that they realised it
would make twinks far too unbalanced, especially if Dex actually effected
time between swings high dex would equal natural haste, so it was changed (I
assume before beta)
Maybe these write ups on stats were originally true, we'd all be wearing
Serp Bracers :ï¿½)

Can't comment on big jumps, never been on the receiving end of something
like Avatar but my character has something like 40extra Dex over natural
and, yes,  it makes no noticeable difference to me with procs.

I wonder if EQ2 will work any different. After now being able to limit the
equipable level of items could they then make a characters stats actually
effect his/her performance.
