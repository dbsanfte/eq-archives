And generating hate.  And since it causes no damage, it doesn't break 
mezz, and since stuns generate hate even if they're resisted or the mob 
is immune to the stun element, cease can be used to generate hate on 
mezzed level 70 mobs without waking them up.  Not bad for a level 7 
spell which costs 15 mana.
