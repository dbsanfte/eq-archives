Sorry, I completely misunderstood you there.  I took your words "Give it a
try some day, even if it's only a few months" to refer to thinking for
myself.  A bit out of context, it would seem, but I hope you can see where I
swerved from the tracks.

As far as my parroting right wing doctrine, there's a reason my words sound
like it... that is, I believe it to be generally correct, apon a review of
the facts, just like you believe it to be incorrect.  I tend to read what's
available to me.  I get my news from CNN, Fox, The Washington Times,
sometimes the New York Times, The Daily Press, and the Virginia Pilot.  I
also listen to the conservatives, as they tend to dig up little bits that
seem to get "lost" elsewhere.

Oh, and as far as living in a European country goes, that's one of the
reasons I joined the navy, was to get overseas duty... too bad I got
suckered into nuclear power, and can't find billets outside CONUS.  >_<
Still, I'll try not to judge all of Europe by the time I spent in Crete.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
