OMG, that is just awesome.... they are banished to another zone....
but right were they could totally get their arse handed to them.  I
can just see the bard running wild in Hate / Fear / Sky, trying to
stay alive... 

Ive never been to Sky, but that looked to be the easiest to get away
from (out of my ignorance), since they just have to hop off the edge
to zone out.  
 Hate would just be total suckage.  If there is a zone out from there
I have never heard of it.

If this is true, I applaud the dev's who came up with this method of
fixing a sploit and demonstrating to others to NOT use sploits.
