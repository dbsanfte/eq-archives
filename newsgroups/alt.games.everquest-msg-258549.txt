Although many people complain about other aspects of the portal stones, 
it can't be denied that some people complained about the loss of taxi 
money... and Davian's just saying he didn't have a lot of sympathy for 
them either.

Although I thought taxi money pretty much died out with the coming of 
the Nexus, unimaginable as a wait of up to 15 minutes for a port might 
be today :)
