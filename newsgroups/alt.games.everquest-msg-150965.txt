Get a port to the Nexus, either from a wizard or druid, or by way of the NK,
GFay, Tox, Dreadlands, or Great Divide scions and spires.  If you have to
use the scions, just hail one and it will tell you how to get the port.
Once you arrive in Nexus, turn 90 degrees to your left and follow that
tunnel to the next zone.  You'll know you made it when the game animations
slow waaaay down.  Just look at the ground for a few seconds and turn your
far clip pane to 0%.  Then you're ready to shop.
