If you mean the canoes, you step onto one, look downward,
and left-click or right-click on the bottom of the boat
(the last time I tried, some zones required the left-click,
some required the right-click -- go figure).  When you
successfully do it, you'll get a message like "You have
the helm".  At that point, when you move forward, back,
left, right, etc, you'll be steering the boat instead of
walking your character.

To disembark, do the clicky-thing again.

Note:  The canoes are considerably slower than just swimming,
if you have a decent swim skill.

Note #2:  Don't try to bring a passenger with you,
weird things happen (like they and "their" boat end up
in a different location from you and "your" boat).
