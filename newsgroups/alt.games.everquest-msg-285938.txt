Well, I believe the notion that traded revolutionary graphics for
compelling gameplay is debatable where WoW is concerned, but that's a
tired discussion at this point. Besides, I think the graphical
direction was excellent. They really did create a world of Warcraft.
I've just always felt that a shallow, rock-paper-scissors approach to
class design in any MMORPG just makes the whole endeavor a big waste
of time. What can one say, though. It sure worked for them. /shrug
