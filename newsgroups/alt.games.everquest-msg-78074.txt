Not just "might", it *will* give you exp.  However, be
aware that light blue cons give you less than 100% of their
total exp, because you're "slumming".

Under the old (pre-light-blue) system, "high greens" would
give you either 50% of their regular exp, or 25%, depending
on how low they were.  I'm not sure if the same percentages
are used for the new "light blue" system or not, but Verant
has stated that they do give less than a full exp reward.
