I have a level 16 Troll SK and my sister plays a level 15 Troll Shaman.
We've been hanging around lately near Neriak, (Lavastorm, Najena, ...etc.)
Where would be a good place we could go to to find some good
battle, loot, and fun?

Experience really isn't an issue lately. I'm looking to make a little money!
