    They'd find out about it when they arrived. By that point, you've used
up two or three hours of the six hour time limit and can't exactly go back.
That change would be dramatic enough to wipe them all in the first fight
before they even knew what was happening. Get back up and going in a half
hour, including time to analyze WTF just happened, go again - and get
creamed by the aggro bug. You're now beginning to run into the time
constraint, and you might not have the people there to adjust to keeping two
MTs up at all times, so you're hooped.

    The encounter is changed in a non-trivial manner, and aggro is messed
up. Between the two you're going to have a lot of anguish.

    Everyone is reporting crits of all sorts having inordinate aggro. Makes
me laugh, because one competing guild is very, very heavy on wizards
(usually can get 10+ of them on a raid), and they just got whacked around
patch day. I haven't noticed high aggro on healing crits, but we've been in
Air and aggro is always odd there because of the mem blur thing.

    You may want to go back and look at your diagrams of Rallos Zek. ;-) And
this is a massive increase in Rampage range versus the old Fennin Ro. I'm a
CH-team cleric, and we'd stand within the radius of the AoE but outside his
rampage range. So his old rampage range was in the neighbourhood of 100
units. Now it's 300 units. Pretty much anyone that can hit Fennin Ro can be
hit back by rampage with that kind of range. Casters can't even use bolts,
since IIRC bolts are all fire based and Fennin is immune to fire.
