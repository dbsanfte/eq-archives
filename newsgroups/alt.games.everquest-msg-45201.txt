That would certainly change things a bit.. .mind you it makes absolutely
no sense, like calling a damage spell "Hypnotize" or a root spell "Speed",
"torpor" sure -sounds- like a slow.

I've grouped with 60 shamans, and never noticed them casting this
heal particularly, although rarely do they tend to discuss these matters
in detail.

At any rate, this only makes the bard as healer thing even -less- germane;
if Shaman get by as healers not by slowing the mobs and regenning the
tanks, but by having yet another heal spell, how does that help make your
point that a bard (who has no direct heal at all) should be a worthwhile
healer if Shaman are?  Now you are telling me that Shaman don't pull
off the healer trick with just SHeal plus regen/slow tactics after all...
