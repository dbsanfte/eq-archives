Well im not new to the high end game :)  But HP does indeed play a big part.
If your main tanking the AoW, you need a MA who can survive 1 whole round of
melee + flurry inbetween cheals (guessing numbers cuz I dont have my
reference, but that means a tank with 6.2khp+)

A mob quadding for 500 isn't so bad.. thats something a monk can tank :)
