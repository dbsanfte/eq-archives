hemmm I woud say buy some of the dorf armor bristlbane can use, but as you
say you dont have alot of PP so you might wanna see if you and your guild
coud take some in giants in Keal arean, that dont cost that much only the
gems you need to quest the armor in Thurgadin. Unles you hunt them your self
too.
