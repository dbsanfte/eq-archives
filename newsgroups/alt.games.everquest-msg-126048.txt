I'll tell you about my experience with SRO.

It was a Friday night, just turned midnight PST, and I zoned into the zone.
It was empty (!!!) except for a warrior in his teens that was running around
killing things his level.  I decided to just walk around and see what's
going on.  Went to the center of the zone.  Lo and behold, there was the AC.
Wow!  I had only a bub of mana so I decided to follow him around while
trying to med.  This only went on for about a minute before he just
disappeared!  I was very upset.  Thus began my 8 hour camp that night.
Teamed up with a higher level tank and tried all the tactics we could think
of.  At 8am, weary and tired, we both went to sleep without seeing the AC.
I think it really might be random.

I have Jboots to this day but got them by earning the money.  (I'm on FV for
those of you thinking of starting the NO DROP thread again :) hehe )
