Don't waste your time or your energy. If he can't fabricate it or get out of

Look at how he handled TwoHead (ROTFLMAO!!)

Just poke fun at him like the piece of shit that he is and enjoy the laughs.
He is the most entertaining one-man-pussy show I've ever seen, unrehearsed
and without meaning to be.
