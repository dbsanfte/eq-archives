In most cases, they get warned. 3 strikes, and they're suspended.
Continuing to use exploits after that is a banning. There are times
when the last happens right off. In the case you refer to, the entire
guild knew damn well they were exploiting and outright said that they
didn't really care. It was also an "end-game" encounter, and the
exploit made it far easier than it was intended to be. Using the
exploit to "win" the encounter lessens the accomplishment for anyone
who does it legit later, because the exploiters were the first to do
it at all, legit or non.
