Besides hurting the monk by weight, autosplit screws you out of your
share of the coin loot.  First, autosplit rounds down and gives all
the leftover to the looter.  Support there were 11 plat, and 6 people.
The fair split would be for 5 people to get 2 plat, and 1 person to
get 1 plat.  The person who gets 1 plat should either be random, or it
should be the person who loots (which would encourage rotating the
loot duties).

Autosplit would handle it like this: 11 plat divided by 6 people is
1+5/6 each.  That means everyone gets 1 plat, and there is 5 plat left
over.  That leftover goes to the looter.  Resuling split: looter gets
6 plat, the other people each get 1 plat!

Second, autosplit treats each time of coin independently.  Suppose
there are 2 people in the group, and the loot is 3 plat, 10 gold.  The
fair split is 2p for one, 1p 10g for the other.  Autosplit treats the
plat and gold separate, so first splits the plat (2p and 1p).  Then it
does the gold (5g 5g).  So, the resulting split is 2p 5g and 1p 5g.
