Well, this was the main reason that I chose Shaman over Druid: Debuff's.
The druid has none.  With your scheme, how do you prevent resists?  A
necro's dusk series?  If so, a necro would be drawing massive aggro.

No other real reason for a Druid except for Tracking and for that I say
Bard.  The bottom line in everything is less downtime.  With original scheme
+ Bard there is none.  TONS of mobs --especially caster mobs-- would drop
sometimes at the rate of 2 melee rounds with that much damage.  Necro with
regen would never even have to med nor Shaman due to his regen/canna
combined with the fact that his only 3 real jobs are sow, regen and debuff.

Re: the pet army, my main is a Mage.  Bless our hearts, our dumb pets can
get taunted off by other mobs.  Rogues are always adaptable, always
evadeable.  >:->
