The killstealing is *rampant*. It puts the Paludal Caverns d00dz to shame. 
The KS'ers just don't get it, either. I engaged a group of 3 mobs last 
night. After locking down two, I started working on killing the third. When 
he was dead, I turned to see a blaster finishing off that last of the other 
two. I asked her, "Could you not see me fighting these?!"

She replied, "You need to relax." They just don't get it. It's like playing 
with toddlers sometimes they way they seem to have no concept of sharing or 
common courtesy. They see something they want, they take it, and you're 
just supposed to be ok with that.

When this happens every once in a while, it's no more than a minor 
annoyance. Last night it happened on more than half of the open street 
fights I was in, and that's no exaggeration.

So far, that's the only glaring weakness of this game IMO.
