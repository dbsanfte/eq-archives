Sparkup, I served 8 years, including during GW1.

Have respect for those in this Nation that VOLUNTEER to serve their Nation.

The Iraq Service personal are NOT given the choice.  It is serve or prison,
and/or Death.

Please THINK before you speak here.  Our soldiers Have the choice.  They go
to war to ensure the safety of their families and all those that choose not
to serve.  Have you served your nation Sparkup?  Have you offered to give
your life to serve and protect those that you love and that love you in
return?  I doubt it.  Please take time to think about what you said.

To all others:  Sparkup is the product of the Mainstream Media/antifreadom
left.  Have pity on him.
