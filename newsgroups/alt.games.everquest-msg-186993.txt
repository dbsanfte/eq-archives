Found this amusing, posted as a followup on my guilds public forum for 
guild applicants:

"I am going to procede to stay in my current guild for just a little 
longer... At least until I get my epic which should be next weekend, but 
soon after I will be wanting to join TA.  I have 2 sponsors, but once I get 
my epic, I will Start grouping more with members of TA and trying to get my 
last sponser.  
Thanks for all my supporters, and you should soon have an epiced bard"

Needless to say, we are jumping right on it in an all out effort to recruit 
him.
