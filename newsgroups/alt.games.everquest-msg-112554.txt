Thanks for the response. I don't need to play the game with full clipping.
When I am in zones that get bogged down by having the clipping plane way
out, I bring it in and all is well.

My question is: Given that EQ has settings that allow you to have the
clipping plane way out there, what kind of machine would it take to use that
feature? One response so far has been that ".. that machine does not exist",
I am inclined to believe that statment. Hoever, I am curious as to if there
is anyone out there with a different opinion? Is anyone running a P4 2.2 GHz
machine with Rambus memory (theoretically the fastest single proc Wintel
machine available)? What kind of frame rate would this machine generate in
the worst zones (Luclin)? Would a dual processor machine make any
difference? (My guess is that EQ would not make use of it.)
