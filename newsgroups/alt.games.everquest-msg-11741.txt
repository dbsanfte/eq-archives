My favorite English language foibles are how some words are spelled
the same way and yet pronounced differently, while some words are
spelled different and pronounced the same. Used to drive me nuts in
school.

Take these words for example: comb bomb and tomb. All three words
are spelled similarly yet pronounced differently. Then we have: There, their
and They're. Pail and Pale.

Then there are some words that are pronounced differently depending
on their context. For instance: "Did you <read> that book I gave you?"
"Yes I <read> the book." Same word 2 different pronunciations.
