    Well, with all the folk who are finding they can no longer play after
the upgrade, it would be humorous to find that the game that gets the lion's
share of EQ defectors is not the big challenger, DAoC, but an older rival,
Asheron's Call...heheh....

All those of us who's systems can't handle the upgrade may find AC more
affordable than a new video card......(and if your machine can't handle
Luclin, then can it handle DAoC?  probably not....)

With me personally, after last night, I know buying the expansion will be a
waste without a whole new video card (which isn't in the budget for months
to come).  In a similar vein, if I want to expand past 256 MB RAM, I'm going
to have to buy a whole new machine (mine's at it's limit)....and most the
folk I adventure with are in a similar situation machine-wise, where they'll
no longer be able to play the game either.....

Asheron's Call.....I shudder to think......
