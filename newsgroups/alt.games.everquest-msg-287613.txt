Until July 25, 2008.

The step up gear is a Legacy Satchel with 7 slots. One item in it
is a POK book, open the book, you go back to POK. A stack of 10
potions, 30 minutes of extra exp. A stack of 10 speed potions. I
think its for movement. The 3 armor items are by class and level.
They are atuneable, and only become no trade after one character
uses them. So until they are placed on one character, you can
move them around. Defiant armor is dropping at random in all
zones. All returning accounts are given all 14 expansions.

If you start paying before the expiration date, you get to keep
all of it.
