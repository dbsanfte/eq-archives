Why worry about resists? There are five Necros throwing Fear in
unison, unless the mob is severely red ONE of them is gonna stick.

Likewise the Snare. If the mob comes in chasing the Druid sans Snare,
five taunting pets hit it while everyone throws a snare (including the
Druid) - someone announces that the mob is Snared and then the five
shots at Fear go off.

Hmmm. Maybe a Druid, a Bard and four Necros?

Assuming the Druid knows how to use Harmony properly there should be
no other mobs in the fight. If there are however, don't forget that
Screaming Terror makes a nice mez in a pinch.
