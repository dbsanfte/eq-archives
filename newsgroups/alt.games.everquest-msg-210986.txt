The thing is that with a warrior you don't need to sit and heal back up 
to full.  Bandage up to 50, and go kill another.  Choose your targets 
wisely, and you can do that for quite some time.  A wizard on the other 
hand, has to med back the mana at some point, maybe not after every mob, 
but eventually, it will run out.

If you are soloing a warrior, you have to remember to keep a zoneline or 
guards nearby, or put up with the deaths when things go wrong.
