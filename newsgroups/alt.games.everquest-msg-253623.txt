No.   Con message is based on the level difference between the two
characters only.  It does not take into account anything about you, or about
your target indicating relative power or ability.  Illusions also don't
change anything about your character, other than occasionally giving racial
abilites, like regeneration or night vision.

Most likely after you cast illusion on yourself, when you went to click on
the Elementalists, you clicked on a different one than you had targeted
before.  Most enemies will spawn in a range of levels, so one of them could
easily be yellow to you (either 1 or 2 levels higher) while the guy next to
him is red (3 levels or more higher.)
