Sorry, but wizards are good soloers, and also highly desired for raids.
That doesn't even consider the AE group unholiness.  I also haven't seen
them passed up for XP groups all that often, and I never pass the opertunity
to add one, if I have any say in the matter.  I wouldn't say you have it all
that rough.  Now, I can't attest to their difficulty, as I've never played
one.  It may be that, like bards, their being overpowered is compensation
for being difficult to play, though I doubt it's more difficult than playing
an enchanter.  Willing to accept the possiblity of being wrong on this one,
though.

Wasn't even considering the AA in the equation, that only adds to the
wizards' utility.

I haven't really seen wizards begging for groups.  And they don't need to
group, either.

Ah, ok, Paladins are a distant third on a raid.
