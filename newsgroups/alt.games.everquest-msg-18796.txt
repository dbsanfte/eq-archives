Hehe, read it again carefully. The loathe d00ds part is *between
commas*, so it is an *aside* grammatically and the sentence can be
read without it. Therefore, taking the d00ds bit out the sentence
reads: 

I would like a guild with a mature outlook and ones
who place having fun, helping each other out on quests, exploring the
wonderful world of Norrath etc. first.

Anyways, thanks for the info. I'm in the UK also. I'll say hello if I
see you and also check out the guild web page you suggest.

BTW, United Kingdoms do exist, but don't really appeal to me for above
reasons. Seem to be power games and non-roleplayers.

Regards,

BB.
