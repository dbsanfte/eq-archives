Let's start with the simple assumption that you did buy the game. 

Just install the software again and re-use your station name and password. 
No key needed.

Oh, you forgot your station name and password? Just contact Verant's 
customer support and give them the billing information for the account. 
It'll still be there. Still no key needed.

Uh, you don't know the billing information? (didn't we already cover this 
in another thread?) Ok then...

Just be an adult and spend the $10 to buy the basic software - and key - 
and activate a new account. Criminy (Just for you Lokari:), the first 
month's free and that pays for the disk.

Just be sure to let us know what server you play on.
