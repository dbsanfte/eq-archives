From the EQ2 FAQ:

What are the game's requirements?
Operating System: Windows 98/2000/ME/XP
Processor: 733 mhz
RAM: 512 MB
Video Card: DirectX 8 compliant. Pixel shader and Vertex shader compatible
hardware with 64mb of texture memory (eg: GeForce 3)
Sound Card: DirectSound compatible audio hardware

Sorry, I assumed you were commenting on these released specs -- not just
making an argument of "IF they had high system requirements".
