Nah, it really is fun the first time :)  I remember meeting a girl who 
was quite new as well and had just gotten into a guild.  After grouping 
together a couple times she asked if I wanted to join as well, and I 
said yes, so she got a guild officer to come invite me.  He turned out 
to be a quite high level lizzy necro, and cast DMF on both of us, then 
took us for a tour of GFay (jumping off *those* spires at the time was 
incredibly exciting *g*) and Butcherblock, where he flexed his muscles 
and showed off for the little high elf girls by killing the female 
dwarves who hung around the path.  It was one of the funner experiences 
of my EQ life, simply because it was all very new to us both.
