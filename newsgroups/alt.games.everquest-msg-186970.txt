Those where pathing changes probably to stop exploits..
I know of spots in atleast 2 of those zone where you can/could stand in a
spot and use ranged means of combat (spells, songs, archery etc.) to kill
mobs without even being touched by them because the pathing hinders them
from reaching the spot your are standing in.
They don't mean the so called "safe spot" where succor/egress takes you.
