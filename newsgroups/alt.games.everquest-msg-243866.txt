There are all kind of games you can play because the market is so
"perfect" in the bazaar.  You have perfect knowledge of prices, and
can easily and accurately track the prices as much as you want.

When you see other people undercut you on price, you can buy up their
goods, if you believe you can resell higher.

There are other things you can do to get people not to undercut you. 
For example, if they think you don't have too many of what you are
trying to sell, they probably won't lower their prices.  So you hide
some of your wares and replenish the "visible" supply as they are
bought off.  Is that deceptive?  Yes, a little, but it's effective and
in no way against the EULA.  You are playing a trader... traders are
often crafty.
