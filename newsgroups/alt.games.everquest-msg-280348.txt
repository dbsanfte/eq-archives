Unless it got changed, you lose no Med time at all so long as you are not 
attacking.  You gain the meditate advantage even while casting spells 
when you are mounted.  I do this all the time when I am soloing in WoS.  
Just sit on my drogmar, slow, malos, DoT the living crap out of the mob, 
drop spiritual serenity on myself as needed, cannibalize, and let my pet 
hit it in the back with leopard on my pet.
