A) Over time that "_almost_ enough mana for a third" becomes "an extra mob
for every 5 kills" or, mathematically, 20% faster.

B) Learn where to sit.  Do you sit on top of HG hill and med?

C) The sarnaks that are casters are, as far as I've seen, always the static
sarnaks in the camps.  You don't fight casters unless you want to fight
casters.

I will admit that the loot isn't the greatest *unless* you do sarnaks.
