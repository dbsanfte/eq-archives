Mandolin is "all/all" which is to say anyone can weild one.  There's
precious little reason to do so, but if you want your dwarf cleric to
hold an instrument, well, buy a mandolin.

I suppose in a PvP environment it might be possible to really throw
people off as to your actual class by doing this, if you are of a
"bard" race, or one that bards can illusion to, such as dark elf.
