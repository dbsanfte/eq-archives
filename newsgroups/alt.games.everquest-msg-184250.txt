Well, I've heard a lot of people wondering where they could possibly hunt at
those lvls and so far the bast answer I've heard yet was basks in JPF... and
basks are great, sure.  But I was just wondering why nobody has ever
suggested hunting grimlings in the Tenebrous Mountains?  Am I truly the only
person who plays Everquest and knows the joys of killling ugly little hairy
humanoids?

My guild on SZ is trying to get grandmasters in all tradeskills, and for
this we need lots of acrylia.  So ever since I dinged 33 I've been hunting
grimlings to get acrylia.  It was pretty hard up until about 36, but doable
with a good group.  By the time I hit 39 I was able to clear the entire mine
solo in about 20 minutes.  Now, my guild doesn't really need acrylia
anymore, but I'm still hunting there.  Why?  Insane exp (I dinged 41, 42,
and 43 yesterday, playing from about 5PM to midnight).  Pretty damn good
loot -- just selling runes, gems, weapons, etc., to vendors bagged me about
600pp in that one night... plus acrylia sells for very nice plat in the
bazaar.  Now, basks are about that good for exp but they don't even come
close in loot.  Best I can hope for with basks is their eggs, which sell for
2-4 plat each in the bazaar.  I can get 1-2 stacks of eggs playing solid
from 5PM to midnight, and that will get me a maximum of 160pp, but only if
I'm willing to sit in the bazaar for the time it takes to sell an item for
which there's really not all that much demand (don't have a mule account),
and where there's always a couple of bazaar mules selling several stacks who
I'd have to compete with.  Acrylia is much rarer and goes much, much faster.
