Dude, thats 105 points per person, or 630 hp healed per click And since you are
standing still while they work, you are getting the same mana as if you were
sitting.  Everyone not hurt?  DvArbitration will take care of that little
detail.

Indoor zones, you are of course better off sitting your cleric butt down, if you
can still remember where the sit button is, been on horseback so long I'm
starting to lose the reflex.

FT 12 works regardless of whether you are sitting, standing, running the
marathon, or ****ing Tunare in her treehouse.  There's less reason for you to
sit if you have FT 12, KEI, etc. etc. etc. than if you are bare * naked with no
MC... with, sitting is merely another 20 mana per tic in a field of 60, without,
its the difference between 22 mana and 2 per tic.

The rest of your post was interesting and well written, as usual, just these two
little quibbles.
