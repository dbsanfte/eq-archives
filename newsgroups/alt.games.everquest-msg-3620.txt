I take all my 6 to 12 characters to BlackBurrow for cash and exp. Combine
the basic loot dropped and the gnoll teeth (for exp and faction and
moonstones for BB stout and faction) and the various rusty crap, I generally
make about 20 plat an hour with a tenth level character. More if it is a
warrior (kills green stuff fast and can carry more for less trips to
merchant in the Hills.) This is strictly a solo technique. Your Shaman can
rule in there because people always want SoW and higher level people camping
for Gnoll Skins will pay ridiculous amounts of plat for one if you loot one
off an Elite Gnoll. The average I sell them for is 50 plat now and the most
I ever got was 1,000 plat from a dark elf who just didn't want to wait for
the drop. :)
