I played there for several weeks and made a good go at it but finally gave
up in frustration. It was a very fun concept and I would be there still
except that I got tired of banging my head against the same brick wall over
and over and over again. You'd be hunting in Everfrost, far, far away from
the single zone-in at BB, closely monitoring /who for outsiders. Then,
suddenly you'd hear the casting, see the gnome or the druid 20 levels above
you and you'd gain Root, Flash of Light, death. Once, when I had SoW, I
managed to run into the hills and used the z-axis updating trick to try and
lose them, I got pretty far before they finally caught up with me (??), had
the time to stop and cast Root on me and, once again, I was level 1.

Often I would get a tell "Welcome to level 1" with a reference to
www.darkenbane.com. Oh, and the time that I managed to outrun them for a
little bit of time in the hills, they actually sent me a series of tells
congratulating me on my "exploit" and telling me how much more satisfying it
was to kill "a cheater".

Yes, the cheater/exploiters are having a field day with the announced lack
of GMs around. What fun!
