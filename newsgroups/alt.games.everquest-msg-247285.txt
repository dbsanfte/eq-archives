You might want to check again if you haven't recently, and if it doesn't
work still, bug it. I got a ring with chronostrum on it, which extends
buffs 25% and it wasn't working with a lot of buffs it should have, but
after a recent patch it started working. It always worked with my HoT
spells and virtue, but didn't work on buffs like Blessing of Reverence
and Symbol of Kazad. I /bugged it every second day for about a month and
one patch it started working.
