Another indication for me is the fact that we haven't had a prospective
member place an app on our guild's 'Membership Application' forum since
12/4.  We used get 4 - 8 a week that had to be sorted through and grouped
with before tags were applied.

I don't know whether they've gone to tagging people on the fly, but if
they've started circumventing long established procedure in such a way then
that too would be a bad thing.

FWIW, the guild is a family guild, not a hardcore raiding guild,
