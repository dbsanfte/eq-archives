Hmmm, maybe it's not just my imagination that HP updates after using
click-Daring on my old hat seemed extra slow.  Perhaps they've somehow
managed to sabotage the updates from right-click items.

I just made 29 with my "self-made" Druid (he's on FV, so untwinked,
tho georg would say my knowledge of the game is the ultimate twink).
I've not played Kaev or any of my alts on Tunare in over a week, and
I'm having a blast.  Between what a Druid can do, and what I know of
the game, and the relatively low population on FV it's been some of
the best fun I've ever had in the game.  I don't camp anything, just
run from place to place and port from zone to zone gaining xp at a
(to me) incredibly fast pace.  I'm trying to complete the Fine Antique
Ring quest from PoK, and when I finish that I think I'm gonna start
trying to group exclusively for a while so I can work out just how
those Druids I've seen have a big impact do it.  And I'm not worried
about finding groups, there are lots of zones to group in when you're
lo- to mid-30s, I'm a Druid, if there's no group for me here, there'll
be one there, or there, or there....   :)
