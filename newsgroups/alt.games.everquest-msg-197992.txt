Hrmmm, you're right.  So much of the guild-related commentary in these
threads has revolved around family-style guilds that I didn't think to
look back through this particular one.  Sorry.

As opposed to what?  Officer perceived merit?  If so, I'm curious as
to why (if it's not too sensitive a subject to talk about here).

Thanks James.  It's interesting (to me at least) to get a look at a
high-end guild that works without having extreme raid participation
requirements.  I am curious as to what your requirements for entry
and maintainence are.

RL will never permit me to make that sort of time commitment.  Which
is why my interest is mostly focussed on the sub-50 game, the high-
end game just isn't really open to me.
