No, they're talking about the guards in HoH.  Until slightly less than
a month ago, they were soloable to the usual high-level soloing
classes (necro, druid, ranger in this case, bard).  It was possible to
root-rot them or, if one was a bard or ranger, kite them.  The problem
is that there were certain bards who were kiting 6 - 10 of these
guards, and I've heard rumors (unsubstantiated) that some bards were
able to handle even more than that.  These bards were getting 1-2 aa's
PER KITE.  It was a little ridiculous, but as usual, SoE overnerfed -
they changed these guards to summoning mobs.  Trouble is, it punished
everyone ELSE who soloed them as much or more than the bards,  because
root-rotting became impossible.

So they're "fixing" it, but the rumors (again, rumors) regarding the
fix are unnerving - that these mobs will become gaters between 10%-20%
of their health.  This is not going to help the necro or druid who is
dotting at all, and for the bard, who can handle most adds he gets
from the mob gating, regenning, and running back, it's not a problem,
really.  I really hope these reports are wrong.  If bards are worthy
of such "punishment"  (and I don't necessarily think they are), then
why punish everyone else along with them?
