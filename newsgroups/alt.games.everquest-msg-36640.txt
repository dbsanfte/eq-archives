I think it is an even better game to buy now, there have been many
improvements in the last year that make the game as a whole much less
tedious and annoying than when I started playing.

Well it depends on what you're looking for. This is a fantasy setting,
I'm going to take a wild guess that Earth and Beyond is sci-fi. Which do
you prefer? Also, there is a new expansion coming out in December.

> How long does the game stays fun?

Well, I, and many others, have been playing for over 2 years. I still
have yet to play every class I am interested in. Note that I have taken
several multi-month breaks during that 2+ years, however. Also, IMO the
game will stay fun longer if you play with a regular group / friends /
join a good, friendly guild.

> Is there a lot of action?

How do you define action? You can always go somewhere and fight things;
what class you are playing determines the actual level of direct
involvement you will have in battle. There are other things to do
besides fighting when you want a break from that.

> how does the quest system work?

Some are better than others, but most work in a delivery system style,
where someone tells you about the quest, and asks you to go somewhere,
find an item/talk to someone else/kill something, and return items to
them. Some have better plotlines than others; if you want maximum
discovery enjoyment from them, just don't read the spoiler sites.

Hope that helped.
