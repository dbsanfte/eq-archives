when twisitng songs, you need to stop singing the first song THEN start
singing the next.  I havent tried making macros containing multiple songs,
but if I was going to make one I would try:

/cast 1, /pause 50, /stopsong  <<< yes this is a legit command
/cast 2, /pause 50, /stopsong
/cast 3, /pause 50, /stopsong

hope it works and obviously the pauses I have included are there for example
only.
