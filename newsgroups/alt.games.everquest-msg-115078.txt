It's not that far fetched.  After the Warsaw Pact invaded
Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Brezhnev was concerned a huge public
uprising against the Soviets would occur.

In March 1969, the Czechs beat the Russians in an international Hockey
championship.  The victory led to anti-Russian riots across the
country, which resulted in Brezhnev ordering the pro-Western,
pro-democracy Communist Party Chairman, Alexander Dubcek, removed from
office and hard-line stalinist government reinstated.

The result was 22 years of oppressive, heavy handed rule.  Victory can
be sweet, though.  After 1989, the leading intellectual dissident,
Vaclav Havel became President and Alexander Dubcek became the leader
of the Czechoslovak Parliament.

"Example is the school of mankind, and they 
will learn at no other." --Edmund Burke
