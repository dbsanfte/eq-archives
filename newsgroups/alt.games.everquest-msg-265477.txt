There wasn't any levers to pull this morning.  All I could do was to
waste some prismatic dyes to blacken a few select parts of the ballot.
I figure I blew over 1000pp worth of dyes.

I did have to deal with a huge crowd waiting for a free KEI in front
of the main library (seriously, main library at school) and took me
about 15 minutes to wade through.  That is on top of about 30 minutes
I waited for the sun to rise and vanquish the skeletons.
