Depends on who owns the people. If you own a television it is perfectly
legal for you to destroy it. Same with a toaster. Not with a kid, you dont
own the kid. Animals also have special protections.

If your belief is that the goverment owns you and you are just a cog in a
big machine then yes they can tell you what to do. Slavery can be mighty
comfortable , why you never have to make any decisions for yourself and you
always know that as long as you are usefull you will be cared for. Might be
kinda hard getting you square types in that round hole but we can do it.
Security is what the majority of women and and a significant minority of men
want and crave above all else.

If you believe that you own yourself and that the goverment is by us for us
then we have a problem. If you own you , you can do whatever you want with
you. Freedom includes the freedom to fail. Freedom comes with the great
gnashing of teeth sometimes, you cannot just love freedom when everyone else
is doing exactly what you want them to be doing. You cannot say you wish to
live free and have any respect for drug laws, seat belt laws, helmet laws,
suicide laws etc.

Those who would trade freedom for security deserve neither- Thomas Jefferson
