I noticed the same thing and wondered..why are the maps written with
such light colored lines..its useless..then I found the reason.

The maps are meant to be viewed with a "faded background". When the map
comes up, the mapbackground is 100% opaque (no transparency), and its
difficult to see the map lines. You need to right click the map title,
pick background level or alpha level (i forget which..probably
background lelve) and there are two choices..a normal choice and a
faded choice. I make the normal choice like 50% and the faded choice
like 20%. When the map is open and the mouse is off the map, after a
few seconds the map background goes from normal level to faded level.
The effect of the level is to make the background transparent..now you
can see through the map window while traveling, and the lines still
show up brightly so its easy to navigate.
