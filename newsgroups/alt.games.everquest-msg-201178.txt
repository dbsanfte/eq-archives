Not if you are root-dotting... ;)

Of course, if I had an unlimited supply of mana, I could play my Druid 
like an out-and-out Wizard, but that's not the issue (remember that I 
also oppose KEI for lower levels). And I don't see much of a difference 
between "casting no more often" and "casting less".

The problem is that in the course of the debate you seem to have taken 
the position that downtime is good, and those who dislike sitting on 
their ass when they should be playing are somehow immature l33t d00dz.
