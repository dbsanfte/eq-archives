On the subject of our patch today:

1)" Expanded Friends List: The Friends List will now hold 30 character
names. And each character has its own friends list. You can find and edit
this list with a text editor, if you need to, outside  the game. "

- What a great idea this one is- playing on different servers as I do- It
will be nice to get rid of all the scraps of paper and the Notebook with
names written on them that sit beside the computer..

2) "You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank. "

- This was an unexpected improvement- glad to see it happen!!

3) " Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows, the better the quiver the
faster your bow. "

- From a RL perspective this makes sense - better quality equipment does
perform better -  and further it now gives tailors a market for all those
quivers they make that used to be sellable only to a NPC!

4) As for the PvP changes - I am also pleased, it makes sense to allow a
modicum of safety from newbie campers across the globe - and for those of
you whining about  this allowing mule transfers and such- get a life - If
you've got a high level on a PvP server with enough to transfer and assist
anyone it's your right - you have definitely earned it - especially since
you achieved your successes obviously without the benefit of Sanctuary or
the new rule addendums/changes.

Be safe all and hunt well......
