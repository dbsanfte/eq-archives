There are factions for guards, Inner and outer dreadguard. You can get
faction with outer by killing halfees in the forest. Avoid the bridge guards
by swimming across the river (there are piranha in it tho) the zone has now
been improved as a hunting area (some orc camps have been added and the
halflings moved and also some high elf casters by the Wizzy pyramid) If you
kill enough halflees you'll be able to enter Neriak Foreign Quarter and be
bound by zone but the inner guards are a different faction so you're not
going to be able to proceed any further.
