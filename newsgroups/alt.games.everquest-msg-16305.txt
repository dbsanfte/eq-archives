1. Do the SRo AC instead of the OOT AC.  The SRo one is level 30 and
only has about 1600 HP.

2. Use tboots instead of jboots.

3. (Probably hardest for you) Make friends.  Many a time I've seen
guilds go to SRo or OOT with the intention of getting jboots for
members that could use them.  Also many a time I've seen a caster who
already has jboots kill an AC in passing and take the ring, to let a
friend multiquest jboots.
