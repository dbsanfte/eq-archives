Er, I don't necessarily disagree, but why does that follow from the "bind
sight" statement?

> Just curious, but did CiH know you bound sight on them?

Yes, it was done with permission.  They actually enjoyed showing off how
well they could do the event, compared to us.  =)  They've watched us do the
event, too.  It's painful to know your arch-rivals are watching you fail
time and time again.

One thing you may not be aware of: one of their most-hated members was
kicked out of the guild over ebaying guild loot for real-life dollars.  He
responded by posting a fairly comprehensive guide on how CiH kills Rallos
Zek on the drinaleq.com boards.  So there are no longer any secrets on how
CiH runs the event - it's only a matter of execution.  Right now, they
execute much better than we do.

Well, I think it's the hypocrisy that bothered me the most.  When he talked
about being recruited, he joined in on all the jeering over CiH's recruiting
tactics.  And he was amongst those who has complained publicly and
vociferously about CiH's tactics and behavior.  Yet, when they applied
pressure on him to join, all that went out the window.  Getting to the
end-game was more important to him then reputation and honor.

If there ever comes a time when I decide to leave the guild, it will *not*
be to join CiH.  Never to join CiH.  I want to see the end game, but not on
their terms.

However... that doesn't necessarily invalidate your point.  While I'm
experiencing feelings of frustration on how my guild is operating to the
point of considering moving on, I'm annoyed when someone else does exactly
that.

Yup.  Last night I tried to get together one last CoD group with some other
clerics and necros, but the necros were too busy soloing and sopping up
every last drop of XP before the nerf.   =)

Just that our usual method of dealing with Agnarr is to kite him and all the
adds around the circumference of the room while we huddle in the center.
After the portals are killed, we split the adds off and bring them to the
center while the rest continue to be kited.  We didn't even have charmed
pets as a discussed contingency, because it seemed unlikely that *all* of
our kiters would die.  (I'm still not sure how that happened, maybe just
really bad luck.)  However, that doesn't mean we didn't know about the DPS
of charmed pets; that's what we usually do against Emerick, after all.  When
the kiters died, we fell back on the Emerick strategy.

It was perhaps incorrect to say that the strategy was entirely new.  Rather,
we used a familiar strategy on a mob we've never used it on before.

=)  Which is good; the entire impulse to visit PoM was based on silliness.

Right.  I went from HoT straight to High Priest in Ssra.

Well, keep in mind I had invis up, too.  I went as far as invis could take
me, which is farther than you might think.  Then I began the DB / DA run.
And I darn near made it, too.

Next time I do this, I'm gonna bring along a Shiny Brass Idol so that I can
have a third DA option.  Of course, I won't be able to do it tonight because
NToV has repopped by now.

Well, keep in mind it took *two* deaths to get me to below 65.  I usually
keep at least a ten percent buffer, but I'd been lazy lately and let it slip
to six percent.

I also made a serious mistake when I went on my naked CR run.  I should have
summoned a Halo of Light or something and equipped it.  As it is, my naked
corpse poofed between the time I logged off and the time I logged on again.
I completely forgot that naked corpses poof very quickly.  I was lucky that
there was a necro in HoT when I logged in that was willing to summon my
clothed corpse, but I felt a terrible sinking feeling when he said I had no
more corpses in the zone.

I am now at zero percent into 65.  Right now I'm pouring all of my
experience into regular XP.  Gotta build that buffer up again.  =(
