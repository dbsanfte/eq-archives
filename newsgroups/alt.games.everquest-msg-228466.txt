I know I saw someone mention the new server, but I don't know if the following
was posted or not...  

This comes from the Station site and of course I didn't think to copy the URL,
just the story...  :(  Sorry...
=================================================
Help us Test "The Fallen"
Please help us with testing the new server rule-set for "The Fallen".  If you
would like to help test this exciting new concept, please patch to EverQuest
using Testeverquest.exe, which you can find in your Everquest directory.  Once
patched, select "The Fallen" from the server directory and you are in.  Here is
the proposed rule-set for this server;

-         Any character that is slain for any reason what so ever will be reset
and placed back into newbie status.  Characters will not be restored or
resurrected for ANY reason what so ever.  Once you're dead, you're dead.

-         Each account will only be allowed one character on this server.  Any
PvP death results in the killing player obtaining a number of points based on
the levels of the characters involved.  Players can only gain points from
characters that are within 5 levels of them.

-        You may loot all tradeable items from the corpse of the character you
just killed, all other equipment is destroyed with the character.

-        The server will make use of the Firiona Vie no drop rules (few things
will be No-Drop)

-          The server will have the old world (Antonica, Faydwer, Odus) plus
the Legacy of Ykesha expansion ,  and will only allow characters to reach level
50 with no AA.

-        The server will have a doubled experience modifier to facilitate
faster paced gameplay. 

-         Players will not be able to turn on /anonymous or /roleplay to hide
their current location.

Help us out and let us know what you think.  You can use the Submit Comment
link on the Dev Corner to send us your feedback and ideas.

Thanks for your help and I hope you enjoy "The Fallen"

======================================

Sounds kinda like it will suck to me.  LOL  I die a lot.  :(  Anyone else have
thoughts?
