Sounds like a HUGE job to get it working at all.  Not to mention the fact
that as Verant changes
Everquest, they won't necessarily hold the client<->server protocol sacred
and not modify it along with the client.  So you'd have to keep up with
all of the changes to the protocol purely by reverse engineering the packets
traveling back and forth.  And to what end?  So you can run on Linux, and
maybe get better graphics performance (doubtful).  Much easier to just
buy a high-end graphics card and a fast processor and be done with it.

Hopefully Verant has some more graphics engine changes in the works that
will make us all happy(er).
