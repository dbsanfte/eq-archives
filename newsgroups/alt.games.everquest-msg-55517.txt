You are the vocal minority for your side of the argument.

I did not say that any one that is not in the vocal minority was being
apathetic. You said that just now. The reason is usually that the subject
does not particular concern them but as soon as the vocal minority express
the concern they then make a decision. Otherwise Life goes on in the same
old rut.

What I fail to understand is the lack of some people to listen to any side
of the story that is not their opinion and even further fail to see why some
people have to resort to derogatory remarks to those that do not happen to
agree with theirs.
