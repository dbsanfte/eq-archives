Bah!  I was tanking in The Grey yesterday after the warrior left.  The 
cleric mentioned that he was very suprised that he was staying FM and just 
dropping celestial heals on me.  Cleric switched to nuking and one of the 
necros took over healing me.  Having 1118AC unbuffed counts for something.

Certain bard songs generate huge aggro, especially the slow/snare songs.  
The buff songs generate a negligable amount of aggro.  I suspect they used 
to generate a LOT more aggro.  I rarely pull aggro off the MT unless I'm 
using my fastest weapons AND twisting DoTs.

Bards are great pullers in certain situations.  It all comes down to 
learning how to pull.  The best pulling songs are debuffs, because they 
generate very, very little aggro.  Your level 12 Brusco's Boastful Bellow 
is another good pulling song if you don't want the aggro.

Bah!  Bards just learn to type in little 3-second bursts.  Leads to some 
interesting conversations, and also quite a few mistells.

Well, except that our food and water song is STILL broken.  But yeah, 
bards are hands-down the most versatile class.  We're also the only class 
that can cast any song OR item on the run.  
Bards seem to really come into their own past 55.  When all the other 
support classes are whining about the holy triumverate getting all the 
attention, bards just happily fit in wherever needed, and with our newer 
armor and weapons, we're pretty damn good tanks.  One of the warriors in 
my guild was grouped with me with others hits on, he was shocked at the 
amount of damage I was doing.  Now if I could just get that 12/16 1hs from 
Ssra Temple I would really do it right.
