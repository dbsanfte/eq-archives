Yes, I meant flagging.

I'm not familiar enough with BoT to speak about specific named mobs
but you need to be able to handle mobs that hit for around 800 and are
only partially slowable at best. Given what I saw with our 65 chanter,
you'll need a chanter and a shaman/mage/bard to debuff before even
attempting to slow at lvl 65.  

As to what group you'd need, we have done the named there with a 65
sk/chanter, 62 shaman/druid/paladin, 61 Sk, not exactly an uber group
but one that was used to working together. Druid spammed her 3k heals
and I added in my quick heal in between, was enough to keep the tank
alive even with our low dps group without really getting LoM. I'm sure
we coulda done it with a low 60s warrior replacing the SK. You almost
need a high lvl cleric or enchanter for lull though. Lots of casting
mobs so it's hard to feign split and any enchanter high enough to mez
the giants can probably lull them instead anyway.

Well, there's quite a few camps in CT where you can easily go without
crowd control. Planks, the slime pools, the maze..., none of those
have many (if any) caster mobs.

Offtanking really isn't a problem if you have a shaman to slow. My
shaman at 60 could pretty much offtank anything in CT. Problem is that
you have a lot of casters with really annoying spells, the main one
being an unresistable AoE slow/Dot. 

4c might be doable if you don't head up the pyramid. You can set up in
the middle of a wall where most (if not all) the roamers are melee
mobs. Not sure if the green lizards are over lvl 55, if they aren't
you could probably chain stun or have a bard/necro mez instead. Not
many browns until you start moving up the pyramid. 

I seem to recall a recent patch where they un-nerfed harmony in CT,
which would make doing 4c without a chanter pretty easy too since most
of the spawns are static. Never really checked, lizards in CT is one
of two pre-pop places that never seemed worth the bother w/o an
enchanter. 
... other one being the rat tunnels in DN. 

Hope you enjoy the place if you go there, it really is a pretty cool
zone with nice (if extremely rare) drops. 

Rgds, Frank
