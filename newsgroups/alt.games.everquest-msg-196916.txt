I suspect that few players are clever enough to take advantage of an
"extra streaky" RNG, so it nets out to making large scale results seem
more random.  I do like the way it appears to work in EQ, seemingly
they toss some numbers in a bucket and keep reusing those numbers for
a while, a lot more than what I've seen in other games where at the
start of a battle one or two numbers are generated which "bias" the
entire battle (the latter is very easy to exploit).
