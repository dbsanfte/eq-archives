I found that GMs are usually very willing to change surnames, but bark
at removing it.  The reasoning being that you found it cool to have a
surname a year ago when you first hit 20 (and where so uber you had to
show it), but now at 60 it's cool to not have a surname (showing you
resisted the need to be a show-off).
If you just want a change, just petition it with a request for a new
name, state whatever you reson you like (getting married, setting up a
guild with all last names etc).
