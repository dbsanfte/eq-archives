MMORPG is a popular acronym standing for Massively Multiplayer Online Role
Playing Game. Look at the second word, it says that the game is meant for
groups larger than one. Furthermore only 2 current Expansions cater
exclusively to higher levels: POP, GOD. How is it a flaw to cater to those
for which the game was written, espansions I mean, POP and GOD? Think of EQ
as a big chat room where instead of chatting about the latest re-run of
Dukes of Hazard you go on adventures and kill stuff and meat other different
and interesting characters. If you went to a regular chat room you wouldn't
sit there and find the one chat room that was empty and sit there typing to
yourself. LOL, "I can't solo so I'm going to gripe about it in newsgroups
and find somebody to whine to."
