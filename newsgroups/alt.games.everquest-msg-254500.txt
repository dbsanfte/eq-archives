I didn't really notice any more slow down than normal in PoK, mostly
it's from the PC models. They are what sucks down resources. Pets are
more like Mob models, they aren't nearly as resource intensive.

They could do that before the patch too. Zoning pets does not make
that any easier or harder. Now in regards to growing them, that has
been able to be done off and on in the past.
