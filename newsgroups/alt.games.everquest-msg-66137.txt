I just remember some of the games I played on my original Amiga 1000, with
it's blazing 68000 processor.  I remember playing games off of floppy disks
that were so far ahead of anything available for the PC.   PC games have
managed to catch up and surpass it, but that's a fairly recent development.
IIRC, the company that made some of the most awesome games performance wise
was Psygnosis, don't recall the names of any of the games off hand though.
