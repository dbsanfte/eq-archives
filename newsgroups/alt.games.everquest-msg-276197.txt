poor bastards. Never realized they had it that bad in WoW; none of my
friends who play it have talked about problems of this scale.. then again:
considering the amount of players WoW has, this thread doesn't even
represent a 'marginal opinion'; maybe it's just a bunch of whiners who whine
just for the 'fun' of it :P

also: if the game has that big issues, i REALLY hope it doesn't result in a
mass migration over to EQ2. from what i've heard, since going live, WoW has
attracted tons of immature gamers whose sole purpose is to make it miserable
for others.. EQ2 doesn't have too many of those (as of yet..).
