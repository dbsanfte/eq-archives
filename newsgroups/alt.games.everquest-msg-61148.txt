I have the same problem. It happens if I loot a mob after I ding, or if I 
hit "I" to open my inventory. It doesn't matter how long I wait to do 
either of those things. It still crashes to the desktop.

The only way I've found to get around it is to zone, or log out and log 
back in again. After zoning, everything is fine.
