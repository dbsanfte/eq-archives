All of those, except for the raptors, I have soloed at level 51 or earlier,
with a wisdom hovering around 190 at the time.  My gear is far from uber.  I
only recently tried the raptors, as I was in TD to help with Faydedar, and
decided to check them out.  At 51, the Sun Reavers were tough, but doable.
At level 53, I have very little trouble with any of them, my wisdom is now
at 209 self buffed (bear form).  I have no damage dealing gear, so all the
damage I deal is spell based or melee.  Generally, I use the root and rot
method, it seems to be the most mana efficient for me.  I have tried using
my pet for soloing, but I find myself using more mana that way.  Usually, I
just pull one with Malosi, run it off to a reasonably safe spot, root it,
put both DoTs (Plague, and EBolt) on it, sit and med until I have to reroot
or reDoT.  I sit far enough away that I can stand and root it without being
touched.  I keep Regrowth on myself, and can II to keep my mana and health
recovering simultaneously.  I don't normally wield any weapon, I have an 8
wisdom scroll in my main hand, and a Testament of Vanear in my off hand.
