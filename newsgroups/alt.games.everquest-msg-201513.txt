Well, from about 30-50, I usually adverage about a hour per yellow. 
You can do better than this if you try hard or get into a good group. 
But as a casual player who does the exp grind, that is about what I
get.

Now, if you add in time to do quests, tradeskills and farming stuff
(for plat or tradeskills), the time increases dramatically.
