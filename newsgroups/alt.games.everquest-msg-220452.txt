It is always the risk in a ML situation.. However, ML is the fairest
IMHO. After all you could do

loot at will - hahaha, so the cleric gets nothing the melees get
everything
loot with auto split, sell later.. - if you are with new people, this
is possibly the safest option, you get something, but it has draw
backs, assuming a full group, and the mob has 5p5g5s6c.  The lootre
would get 5p5g5s1c and everyone else 1c.  So, after a while, the
looter gets rich and everyone else wonders why the loot is crappy.
ML - is great, but it is best if you can find someone you all know.

LD happens to everyone, sometimes it can take an age, ISP issues, PC
dies, RL issues.. One thing you could do is add them to friends and
keep an eye out for them and say Hi when you next see them on, if they
act like nothing happened, ask leading questions like "We didnt get to
say bye to you last time, you went LD while selling, we waited for you
but you didnt come back for ages, is everything ok?" you've lined them
up for an easy "yeah sorry, power cut.. have some stuff for you" or a
walk down to "Im a moron" lane :)
