I haven't gone in game today to check it yet, but I, along with others, 
bug reported the Mortar and Pestle last night.  You could use one of the 
listed recipes without problems until you closed and re-opened the 
Mortar & Pestle.  That's when you found out the recipe you just used had 
disappeared from the Known Matching Recipes list.  Hopefully they are 
working on that.  You could still make the recipe but only in the old 
interface by the old point and click method.
