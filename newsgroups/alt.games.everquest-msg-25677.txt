Known often as "the Bastard Tactic".  I've never heard of anybody being called
out on it by GMs, and there have been numerous discussions of it here where it
seemed to be (almost) unanimously agreed that it's just good tactics. You are
using your knowledge of differing NPC factions to your advantage, in effect
pulling in an NPC as your ally temporarily.
  In Lake of Ill Manners, one of the most common ones was to get the gobs and
sarnies fighting each other and kill the winner. If you were *really* clever
about it you could kill and get the xp for both of them, but at least one.
  Other variations exist, of course, that seem to get more and more "sketchy" as
to whether a GM would allow them.  I observed a guy in W.K. many levels ago who,
several times over the course of one gaming session, pulled a HG to the guards
at the tower.  The HG was able to usually kill both the guards, but by the time
he was done he was pretty damned beat up. The wizard then dispatched the HG with
only one or two nukes, collecting the xp and the loot.
  I've recently seen some folks in Rathe Mtns. doing a similar thing with the
cyclops and giant undead skellies using the guards at the tower up on HG ridge.
