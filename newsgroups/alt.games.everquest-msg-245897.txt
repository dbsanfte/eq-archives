Well from a Cleric's point of view, in BoT I have a rule...... Only one
charmed pet allowed in the group.  I've had FAR too many wipes due to two
charmed pets and Charm breaking etc.  The charm broken pet invariably goes
for whoever has the other pet charmed :P

The exception to this rule are DC pets.  I've had a few nice BoT groups
where we had a charmed and a DC pet and we chewed through the mobs quite
quickly.....
Overall though I much prefer DC pets over Charmed one's even if the DPS
isn't as good.  A charmed pet means both the cleric and the charmer cannot
go AFK.
