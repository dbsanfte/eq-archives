Guess what, Scott?  I just purchased the original game bundled with Kunark
last week, and y'know what?  They came on the same CD!  I hope you didn't
buy them separately ... you most likely got ripped off.

Furthermore, after the EQ/RoK installation was complete, the installation
wizard next asked me if I'd like to install a game called 'Tanarus' which
can be played on The Station.  So I received, EQ, RoK, and Tanarus ... all
on the same CD!!!

Oh, the horror ... the horror ....
