A somewhat spurious comparison. A lot of 'feelgood' movies are plotted 
like this: Good guys get introduced (audience bonds), good guys get into 
trouble (audience experiences pathos), good guys get out of trouble 
(audience experiences disgust at blatant contrivances and... oh wait... 
it's not a George Lucas film is it?. Audience experiences empathetic 
happiness, joy, elation, etc, etc, and are grateful for paying $15 just 
for a poxy 2 hours of entertainment). The payoff for watching such a 
movie is, of course, directly dependant on the audience's perception of 
just how much trouble the good guys were in (and whether or not they 
wanted those lameassed Gungan morons to survive the damn war in the 
first place... ahem). So Jim Carrey's comment is right on the button.

However, MMORPGs aren't just about getting the playing into danger, and 
rewarding them with a 'feeling of triumph' for the simple act (or 
accident) of surviving the encounter. They are (arguably *primarily*) 
concerned with rewarding the player with shiny baubles (a.k.a 'gear') 
and Real Ultimate Power (a.k.a levelling). Mobs are there to provide a 
challenge (and a primary mechanic for gaining said rewards), make the 
process take longer (or *very much* longer :), and provide a means for 
that lynchpin of addiction-psychology: the lure of the random reward.

Even though death, in and of itself, is only a minor inconvenience (in 
WoW at least, and I assume that's the primary target of your subtle 
harumphing re death-nerfing), it still imposes a time penalty in the 
form of the corpse-run (or the dreaded rez-sickness), which seriously 
hampers the player's ability to chase the game's rewards, and is 
therefore highly undesirable when viewed in the context of 
player-as-loot-hunter. After all, the primary goal of an MMORPG designer 
isn't to induce soaring elation and shattering despair in the player, 
it's purely and simply to get them hooked, and therefore subscribing, 
for as long as possible.
