The guy said "plz."  The favor wasn't demanded, it was requested.  Since the
thread started isn't psychic he had no way of knowing the guy would be a
jerk about it later, and neither would you, so don't look into the future in
this situation.

You yourself said that you would interrupt a port cast for an extra
passenger.  Why?  What's the difference?  How is it ANY less rude to the
person you're porting than stopping to SoW a guildmate with "manners?"
Dunno, but I think helping out a guildmate who says "plz" (ok, that
lazy-assed abbreviation grates on my nerves every time I see it, even after
2 years, but I know that it DOESN'T bother a hell of a lot of people) is a
BETTER reason for stopping a cast than any other reason I can think of.

Guys, we're not talking about an evac situation here.  Y'all are griping
about how this guildmate was expecting you to be a buff whore, while YOU
aren't even willing to help him out on this SIMPLE request?

You're saying that he'd better have a damned good reason for wanting to run
faster?  Come ON now, it's a GUILD MEMBER wanting a whopping 40 mana and 4.5
seconds of your time.  How SELFISH can you be not to help a GUILD MEMBER
out?  One with "MANNERS" for god's sake?

I'm glad you guys aren't in my guild.  My guild is based on friendship and
if you can't even spend 40 mana on a guildmate your anti-social behavior
wouldn't fit in it at all.

(before flaming, remember I'm talking about BEFORE the port, not after, when
the guy proved he was a jerk...BEFORE is the ONLY part that's important
because it's when you didn't have to be a jerk and ignore the request)
