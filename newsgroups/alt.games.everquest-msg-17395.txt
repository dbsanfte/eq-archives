Back through tells? I have heard there is one but haven't located it
anywhere.  As it stands now I scroll back a few tells to the person I want
and the have to delete the prior message I gave that person so that I may
send them a new  message.  I'd much prefer to scroll back with just the
"/tell soandso" message with no test behind it.
