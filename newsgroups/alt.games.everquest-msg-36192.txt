The original post said something about the contenders 
using NPCs.  Weird, though - I watched a BoTB on TM once 
and I'm not sure who it was (some kind of casters) and 
*they* were using 'red knight' and 'blue knight' NPCs to 
fight each other.  Never did quite get the point but 
then I got bored quite quickly anyway.  If it's the same 
thing - you're not missing much :)
