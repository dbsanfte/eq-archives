I've been playing my own guys for about a week and a half now (BF is a 61
cleric) ....I've noticed if you are in newbie zones you don't really have to
pay for buffs....seems the new guys with the buffs will do it for free
without you asking since they need to practice them to get better.  I tend
to get sow pretty much whenever I am on atleast once if not more from
someone running up, giving it, and leaving before I can even say thnx let
alone pay them.

I have heard of people asking for donations though and I am rarely out of
newbie areas....why do they ask for donations if they expect 100pp??  The
only way I got real money was from my BF transferring it to me.  Newbies
don't have that kind of money!
