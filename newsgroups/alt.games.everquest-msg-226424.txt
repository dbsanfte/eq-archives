For some reason, I keep seeing people doing mass rods, MGB KEI and other
buffs in the Bazaar.  Not up close to the banks, but back in the vendor
areas.  Often (when I have public channels on), I don't see prior notice.

Are they just playing with their MGB or hoping to catch some folks who'll
want the rods/KEI on their vendor mules, or what?  Or is there some possible
bug they could hit to dislodge someone and open up a trader slot?  (Like the
old "AE lev, then push them out" trick, which was thankfully nerfed.)
