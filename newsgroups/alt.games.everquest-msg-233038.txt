When it does this, try blowing into the vents on the router.  Seriously.
The failure mode when these things overheat is that they start dropping a
lot of packets on the WAN side.  If blowing on it makes it work better,
you've got a heat problem.

Now, if you go read the specs, and it lists some high temperature, and you
*know* that there is no way your room is that hot--well, that's not good
enough, because the temperature they are specifying is the temperature
inside the router.  Many of these routers specify 40C/104F, which is
actually easy to hit if the room temperature is about 70-75F and there
isn't decent airflow over the router.
