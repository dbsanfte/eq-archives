Now let's just take that one, bare statement and apply it to the situation
originally described.  And to throw a little spice into the mix, let's say
that the poster invited a GM to come down and watch him hunt for a while.
(Getting rid of the, "GMs aren't going to bother about somebody exploiting
orcs in CB" thing.)
  So Player_01 stand by the river and fires off a nuke at an orc
centurian.  The orc runs up. Just before it arrives, he jumps over the
water. The orc begins running towards the bridge. Player_01 continues
burning nukes into it until it crosses the bridge and runs down the path
towards him, whereupon he jumps back over the water and continues firing
and/or medding. Soon, the orc is dead and the player was *never* even
close to having been hit by the orc.
  Now stop, take a deep breath, forget defending a position you've already
staked out for a moment, clear your perspective, and tell me that the GM
is going to say, "Oh, sure. That's fine. Don't worry. Carry on until the
orcs green out on you, you clever little man you!"
   Judging by past GM actions and judgements, coupled with Brad's comments
about "getting in free damage at mobs when the player is in no danger of
retalliation".... I think not.
