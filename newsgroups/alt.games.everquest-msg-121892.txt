I have only one question:  Aside from the misspelling, why petition
Ilikepotatos?  I mean, why bother to petition it?  what's offensive
to _you_ about it?
(Damn, a caveat and three question marks, hope it still counts as
only one question.)
Hell, there've got to be hundreds of historical cultures in which the
equivalent construction (or its near variant Likespotatoes) would be
entirely valid, assuming that potatoes were known to the person in
question.  Do I misremember that you were one of those who approved of
the concept of "Indian"-style names?

Kaev
Who now believes that a strictly vegetarian agnostic Troll Warrior
named Likespotatoes would be the "apotheosis of cool" (somebody
please catch the reference, please?) in EQ.
