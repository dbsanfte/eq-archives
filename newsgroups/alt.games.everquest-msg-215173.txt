Damn, my main, 55 cleric unless i am after somethign specific has 7 
leatherfoot haversacks and 1 rallic pack, 1 of which is all components 
[lol, sme friends call me the one stop shop...i have a stack each of 
snake scales, bat wings, fish scales, pearls, bone chips, tiny daggers, 
malachites, tiny coffins and 2 stacks of dots - saves time if you are 
stuck in an interminably long raid in one of the old planes and it is a 
pain to go back for resupply and we just have an hour left.....]and in 
the other is my donal's BP, my spare 2 earrings [to change out resists, 
give me eb] collapsed toolchest, gnomish vanishing device, type 5 mana 
batteries, soulripper/book [if i use the ripper, the book is in the bag, 
if i use the book, the ripper is in the bag] my GM jewelers eyepiece, a 
stack of misty picnics and a stack of kaladim constitutionals. 
Everything else is empty...and if i win a roll it goes into the rallic 
pack. I dont prefer to ML, I prefer to sit and med...but just in case=)
aru
and i tend to have that many empty packs because i do silly things like 
fish for cobalt cod until i get 11 stacks and then buy 11 stacks of 
water to make 10 stacks of cod oils...or to make coldain vel 
tempers...you *know* how many celestials it takes to make a temper? when 
i do the mortar combines everything is full.....several tradeskills are 
very space intensive/ When i smith, i dualbox a mule to stand there  and 
hold stacks and packs of crap...
