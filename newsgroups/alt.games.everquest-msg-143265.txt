I agree I am a 53 Mage. Lets see I can decide to go in a quest that will
take me 100 hours to do because the spawntime of all mobs is 10 hours pluss
the line just to camp it or I could kill mobs in a group or solo , Wash ,
rinse , repeat. or i could go on a raid and be in one of 5 6man groups ,
rarely be in the group that gets xp and caster gear is kinda rare anyway. I
could work on a tradeskill that will mean nothing to me and everyone else in
the game.


Why did I play this game for 3 years?? I dont see it. I must have been hit
on the head or something.

I think I'm gonna play Neverwinter while I wait for Icewinddale. Maybe Ill
pick up morrowind.

At least in Anaichy Online I could Do a mission is about an hour and feel
like I had done something.
