Sounds like your meat grinder group was more of a train maker group. By
FAR, the fastest leveling, most fun groups I've been in have been melee
heavy groups, with non-stop pulling going on. A group with 4 tanks, a
chanter, and a healer can pull continuously with ZERO downtime if
everybody plays it right.

I think most EQ players have never seen this done right, and so they
try to slow the pace down to what they feel is safe.

It's kind of like all the people that say "NEVER USE AE, YOU'LL KILL US
ALL"! Until you've seen AE done right, you will never believe what can
be done with it.
