Ok I am getting a little pissed off at my spells.  I love to solo in LOIO
when I need to get that last bit of experience I need for my levels.  But
when I go to snare a darn mob it gets interrupted.  This happens almost 80%
of the time then finally it works.  Some of my other spells have been
interrupted as well but this one happens the most.  I have 158 Wis on my
druid, and I am level 28.  Do I need more Wis?  I have asked around and I
have about the same or more wis then most druids at my level, if they are
not twinked.  Should I be focusing on other things like INT or DEX.  I'm
kinda new at the game.. this is my main char.  others are very low levels.

thanks for any help you can give.
