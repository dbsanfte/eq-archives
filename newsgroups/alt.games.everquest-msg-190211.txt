Well, many people seem to think that you regenerate to full mana faster when
drunk, but in actual fact you're not *full* of mana if your stats have been
temporarily lowered by the effects of alcohol. You may as well say that
you'd be full of mana much faster if you remove all of your int and mana
giving items when OOM, sure you'd be full in no time - put your items back
on and it's rather a different story.

People seem to splitting hairs over a popular misconception. Ho hum ...
