I bought the game "in error" too.  2 years ago this month.  Thought what the
hey, I'll give it a try.  I had only played MajorMud back in the *olden days*
when it was on a local BBS - I was pretty addicted to that game too.
Got EQ all loaded and had no "picture" at all.  I could hear noises and see
people's "voices" around me but the screen was black.  (Definitlely download
your most current drivers.  I had to do this to get the graphics to work, even
though my computer met system requirements).
I was fully hooked the moment I "saw" the World.  I pay for 6 months at a time
and get a pretty good discount that way.
Should you play?  I say consider it money flushed down the drain.  Throw the
whole thing away and run as fast as you can some other direction.  Unless, of
course, you don't mind spending the rest of your life hooked to this silliness.
