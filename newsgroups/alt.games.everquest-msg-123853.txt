I am not sure where to put this in this thread so I will respond to the 
initial post.  The following definition is on page 84 of the Everquest
Player's guide that ships with the Trilogy edition.

pure caster: Spell casters. Caster classes who use spells as their primary
skills, also known as fingerwigglers. Generally, this refers to Enchanters,
Magicians, Necromancers, and Wizards. (It rarely refers to WIS-casters or
hybrids.) By level 30, almost all of these first four classes have given up
melee weapons.
