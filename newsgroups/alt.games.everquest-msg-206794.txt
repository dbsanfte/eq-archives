: First off, most of those people are probably twinks (meaning they did what
: you are talking about....getting a character high enough and outfitting
: lower characters).  If you wanted, you could try the Stromm server since
: unless people are already way up in levels on that server, there are gonna
: be a lot more first time characters on there.  But if you want to stay on
: the server you're on, here are my two suggestions to get some money.
: Nothing great, but will fund your spells at least and maybe a few
equipment
: upgrades......
:
: Take your ranger to either the Karanas or the Commons and track spiders,
: anything but spiderlings.  Farm spider silks and sell them in the bazaar
for
: 5-10pp each depending on the prices on your server.  That's up to 200pp
for
: each stack and you can get a stack in about 30 minutes if you're lucky.
:

Why anything but spiderlings?  Hunt spiderlings in Everfrost and hunt wolves
and polar bear cubs at the same time.  Save all the non-ruined pelts and all
the spiderling silks.  Make leather padding with 2 'ling silks and a low
quality pely.  Those sell for 20 to 40 pp depending on your server.  MQ
pelts can be turned into LQ with a skinning knofe.  And the HQ pelts sell
for 20 to 25 pp.


: Second (and this requires a bit of an initial investment but still can net
: some good cash)......Vials of Prismatic Dye.
:

Prismatic Dyes are great, but I find the fail rate too high to make them
worthwhile.  Plus, there's always someone selling at 40pp or lower.
Finally, the initial investment is more along the 900pp line for 1 stack of
them to sell plus the skillups.  Probaly too rich for him.

Better, IMO, is baking.  Skill to 191 (up to 150, or so, can be done for
about 25pp) with atty Melts.  They are cheap (about 2g) and sell easily at
7g to 1pp each.  Only problem is that cheese is only in Jaggadpine
