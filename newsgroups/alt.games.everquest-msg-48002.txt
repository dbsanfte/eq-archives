I have a RL friend that is working on making an enchanter.  I've been
helping him get his trade skills started (given him over 2,500 pp in coin
and equipment).  He can now make the wisdom dieties so I'm about to go hunt
sand giants to get the Sand of Ro for him to make them.

I normally put down what I'm aiming for with each slot when doing a post
like this, but this time I didn't because I'm not sure what should be my
goal since having reached 200 WIS.  I've thought about the coldain shawl
quest.  I might do it.  Just wondering if there's something better for me to
go after for the ranged slot.

I have an in-game friend that's an enchanter and she gets all my components
now.  I really rarely ever buy something myself.  I use the Mystic Doll only
when selling stuff to get a better price.  Also the guild I'm joining has
told me that whenever I need to buy components, they'll buy them for me.  At
most, I'll just have to reimburse them for the cost.  Others in the guild
says I won't have to do even that.  Been grouping with them a lot lately and
this seems to be the case.  They're happy to have a player that's dedicated
to playing a cleric.
