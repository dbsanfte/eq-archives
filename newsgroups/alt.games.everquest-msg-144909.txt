Representing about 3Kpp in solstice robes assuming a 50% fail rate....
why the heck not?  Other than the fact that at this price it would be
a better use of my time to go farm the things myself, that is.

Representing... not a heck of a lot.  Yep, that price is silly.  I'd say the
"I
could do this myself" level for this would be around 200pp a stack, I
certainly remember hiring newbies to make them for me at a firm 100pp
a stack and having them line up in droves.  They represent skill ups
in smithing, which are used for the POTC and Shawl quests, of course,
which is why they are valuable at all... but 600pp seems way over the top
for something that is made at extremely low skill from drops off mobs
well under 10th level.

Rare drop in the Hole, now we aren't talking sheer laziness and overpaying
newbies, and used for making several items actually useful even for
high end (non uberguild) characters.  What would really be amazing
right now would be to see someone making a set of what is it, Red
fine plate?

Niether of those items represent anything extremely valuable, or even
somewhat high level skill ups; the arrows are particularly useless, since
they are an end product... at least you could turn the pelts into LQ
and make padding, then sell them for 600pp a stack... why 30pp is
a BARGAIN!
