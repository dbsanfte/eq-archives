I grouped with a very good necromancer last night, and found out just how
awesome a group member one can be.  I was playing my warrior, with a lvl 21
necromancer, and a lvl 27 enchanter.  I was pulling/tanking, the
necromancer's pet was tanking, the necromancer was keeping me pretty much
full health.  The enchanter was breezing debuffing/buffing, nuking.  We were
in LoIO doing single pulls, sometimes 2, yellow and red to me.  The
necromancer had no trouble keeping me full health, we were doing nonstop
pulls, as soon as we killed one mob, I was off to grab another.   It was
awesome.  The necromancer was siphoning off the mobs health, then feeding
me.  I knew that necromancers were great solo characters, they are pretty
damned awesome in a group too though.
