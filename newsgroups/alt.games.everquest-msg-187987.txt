About 0,-4000.

-1500,-4000 (no.4 on your aforementioned mapping site's map). Double-click
the double-doors on the boat.

If you want to experience the fun for yourself, map it yourself. If not,
steal it from www.eq-toolbox.com and access it in-game with Backspace.

> 4. Anyone been there and describe where you zone in from Stonebrunt?
You zone in on a jetty that leads you to a neutral-faction lighthouse on an
island (so no fights to be had on zone-in). Have a chat with the various
NPCs and find out where to go for the fightin'.
