As long as the item doesn't result in a no drop item you should be able to
complete an classes quests at temple of Sol Ro.  I know the Magician Focus items
are no drop, so those are out for your druid.  My druid did the Incandescent
gloves quest for a friend basically because i was in Cazic Thule Exp hunting
with a group and every enchanter in the party had the gloves off of radiant, and
they were just gonna rot, so I decided I would do the quest for my friend.  Only
part I had trouble with was the shadowed gloves, and I did wind up looting those
off of a shout that they were on a corpse.  I think i was on a corpse run at the
time, cause the necro shadowman had fear kited me.  I had been trying to do it
legitimatly, and was doing okay against the non casting shadowmen, but at 30,
the Necro especially, will make short work out of you, if they get their spells
to land.
