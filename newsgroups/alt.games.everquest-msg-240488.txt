I have read quite a bit on the threads on this one and have some
points maybe someone could clarify for me.

If SOE wanted to stop this they could they are in control of the game.
But they invented the bazaar and the casino!! or to put it another way
they want us to exchange our plat, they could stop us if they wanted.

You dont have to buy plat for $$ but, if you do it can open up a whole
new game for you giving better equipment and weapons.  You dont have
to buy Planes of Power to play Everquest either but it makes a huge
difference. Both cost real money and improve game experience very
little difference imo. Therefore your just buying another expansion.

So why dont SoE do it themselves - easy requires user input and sony
works through a large dealer network, hey why not set up an agent
selling plat! Ok thats me assuming but how do IGE get their hands on
so much plat? Kind of made me wonder anyway.

Ok the rules - thats easy - to control this it would be required that
ingame players take care of it, the GMs not likely SoE wouldnt give
this control to any individual (talking about the finance side not in
game conduct). Can, if, could you get banned - you can be banned for
looking at a SoE in the wrong way, if they want to stop you playing
they can as long as they dont take your money.

Just my humble opinion.
