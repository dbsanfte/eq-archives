IIRC, Torpor (which this is a lesser version of) was the most desired
Shaman spell in the game, pre-PoP (I'm sure I'll be corrected if I'm
wrong about that).  This is a spell which you would mostly use on
casters, it's especially good for Shamans and Necromancers who can
convert their hp into mana.
