I'm afraid I have to admit I do see the point of it.  As long as there 
are SUV's out there that are totalling smaller vehicles, it may be a 
rational choice to take the SUV, in order to protect your family.

I didn't mean this little OT journey to swerve into the SUV lane, as 
thats a whole other quandry that ticks me off, but that I can 
understand; they are more dangerous to others, and not having one when 
more and more people do puts you and your family at more risk.  Its a 
self fufilling prophecy, and (having a naturally paranoid mind) one I 
often suspect of being deliberately foisted on us by car manufacturers 
and the oil industry.  But its not all smoke and mirrors, and if it was 
a conspiracy, that doesn't eliminate that fact that its working.

However, my point was not about SUV's, it was about one specific model 
of vehicle, the Ford F150.  I very highly doubt anyone is going to be 
able to prove that a more sensible V6 manual F150 is more dangerous than 
a V8 automatic F150 of the same model year, assuming the driver is 
reasonably competant with a stick shift.
