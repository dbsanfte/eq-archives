I'm living those days in 2002, in my son's high school.  The students AND
the teachers are all convinced that a particular kid is gay based only on
his mannerisms.  MOF, he's the only one the teachers think is gay.  They
don't even suspect the 4 girls who have come out of closet to their peers --
they don't LOOK the part don't you know.

The kid they suspect just graduated and joined the armed forces -- only hope
his fellow platoon members don't jump to the same conclusion (no matter what
they say about blanket parties not being allowed).
