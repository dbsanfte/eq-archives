These firepots are the receiving end of the Tim Deep firepots. These are a
series of transports from Tim Deep to almost any
spot on the world. The reason the key is GM only is because noone is
supposed to be able to go BACK through the pots.
But maybe they wanted to code them to allow for the option in case of a GM
event that used the firepot transpot ... err port!
HEY! If any of you GM's are out there, that would be a GREAT idea for a GM
event. An event that required the participants
to cross continents and oceans in a single night. Make the keys a 1 use item
that is part of the quest to finish the event!

Opps, sorry. I know I was told to quit thinking so much. ;-(
