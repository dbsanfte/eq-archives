Am I missing something in the guides from EQTraders. I have followed 3
now and my results are not even in the same universe as the authors of
the guides. I'm going to leap to a conclusion here and assume that they
were written with end of game characters in mind all with maxed WIS and
or INT.

My Bard is required to learn pottery for the Vah Shir quests. The
EQTraders guide says under 40pp to Master potter. Well, after 50 plus
plat I have a skill of, wait for it,  ROFL, tada! 39!

With characters of levels you see below, 50pp is a chunk of change to
me. My 19 Cleric spells were a particular blow to the old bank account.
Is there a more efficient way to up these skills, or is it simply a
matter of going broke for a while and foregoing much needed armor and
weapons?
