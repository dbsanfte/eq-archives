Jeff, you get the award of the day for making me laugh! I agree, the only
time I use /loc is when I know I'm about to go from the living to the dead,
but I use sense heading ALL the time. I keep it maxed out. My sense of
direction is usually pretty good, in RL, but ingame, if I haven't been to a
particular place, it gets all boggled up. Sense heading (assuming I have the
map of that zone) works like magic. I just can't seem to make HER see that!

thanks,
Dark
