Actually, considering it's now 15 months and two moves after I quit, I
had no idea where the CD was.   So I bought a new acount.

No great loss.   I had stripped my characters and given everything away
when I quit anyways.   I think Janey did too.

I'd have prefered the name back, but I managed to get a good enough one.
Wouldn't have seemed right on this character anyways.  And I started an
account on one of the newer servers and saved my three favorite names
there anyways, just in case.

Just the end of the first day, only a few hours, and we've already run
into Gresh, Magnus, Exodus, Dennis and Ignothead from the old UO
newsgroup days.
