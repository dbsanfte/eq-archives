I can't remember what level hill gaints are, but if they're blue or lower you
should be able to take them.

There are also hill giants in NK as well as griffenes and griffons that
occasionally drop gems. Also a couple hill gaints in EK. Might be hard to
find them without tracking though.

Spectres are also an option. They drops words, gems, and scythes. The scythes
sell for around 10-12 pp. The bronze scythes a couple pp. The rusty scythes
are worthless. Spectres run about the same speed as a PC without SOW.

The Orc fort in EW. Easy to find a group, nice semi-rare drops off most of the
orcs there.
