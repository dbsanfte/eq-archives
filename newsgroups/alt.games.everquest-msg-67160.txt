It is possible to multiquest the starting quests.

Make a new kitty in your class (or have a friend do so if you have
someone willing to run around for five minutes for you)

Have your original cat go to Mingah and get a fresh slate... you
get one just for asking.  Now take him to the registrar and
log out (or just wait if you have a confederate helping)

New disposable kitty hands in their note, then goes to registrar,
then to tax collector, then back to registrar and hands in
that note, after which you (switch if you are doing this on one
account) hand in the slate, and get the note for the king.

Now you just finish the rest of the quest to get your slate
and cloak, good to go.

Destroy that other kitty, who now has no way of getting
-her- cloak.

Note that for replacing just the slate, its possible to
say the correct phrase to the registrar and get one
without all that running around.  I forget the phrase,
but if you hang out next to her, someone will hand
in the note from the king and you will hear it again.

I wonder if its possible for non-kittens to do these
quests in this way, or for kittens of other classes
to get multiple cloaks this way... although the
beastlord quest items appear to be Vah Shir
Beastlord only usable.  Still, might be interesting
to do the quests for the exp and for the feather
in your cap feeling knowing you've completed
them... and if some of the higher level ones
are multiquestable, it could be a real shortcut
to have someone with the correct skills in place
come do the earlier steps (say the Vah Shir
quests, which are giving me trouble at a thus
far 30 tailoring skill)
