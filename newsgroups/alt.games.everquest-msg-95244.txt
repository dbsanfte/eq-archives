I always make it a point to buy spell components and tailoring supplies off
enterprising new players like yourself.  Sure I can go buy batwings at the
vendor in EC for next to nothing, but I gladly pay 5pp or more a stack to a new
player that has taken the time to gather 20 or 40 batwings.  The same with bone
chips or spider silks or whatever similar item I may need.

I hope other higher level players take the time once in awhile to spend that
little extra to fund a low level player in that way - (I know the necros usually
do with buying bone chips).  If you don't reward the one's doing it right and
earning a living, you will find more and more of those doing it wrong and
begging without any effort.

Just my opinion,

Moriarty
