Oops, well thats the trouble with putting people in a killfile... it 
looked to me like you'd posted that line.  Makes the rest of my post 
somewhat questionable, although the point sort of still stands.

MP hasn't quit at all, though (or has she?  How would I know?), so 
presumably knows what 300 people on Platinum plus OOW looks like, and 
was making the claim that thats a workable limit.

Well, I think a more interesting pool would be "when does SOE start 
allowing free moveserve transfers?".  If the people who want higher 
populations can migrate freely, and the people who like low populations 
can migrate freely, maybe they won't need to shut down servers for a 
long time.  Other than the Zeks, which could probably all be 
concatenated to a single server today without ruffling a feather on 
anyone's head.

Hard to see how anyone could argue that point, sadly, I think if there 
wasn't an EQ2 that you'd see EQ continue to rise and fall with the 
tides, but I can't see EQ rising again with a "successor" out on the 
market unless EQ2 crashes and burns.
