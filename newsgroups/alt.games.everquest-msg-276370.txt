I should clarify that I'm referring to EQ2. As far as I can tell there is 
no charisma stat.

Though I've not tested very thoroughly at all, I do know that even in your 
home town, merchants right next to each other can offer different prices. 

I've really only noticed two price levels. I generally shop around until I 
see a difference between the high and low prices offered and opt for the 
high. That may not be a very reliable test, but it seems to me I don't 
really remember seeing more than two different prices for some specific 
items no matter how many merchants I check.
