Don't for get the 34 mage spell Monster Summoning, which can
give you a pet that looks like any monster in the zone.  If
the Mage in question got a green pet with this spell, that
would put it below the spectres.  Some have been know to
terroize the newbies with Sand giant pets too. *shrug*, not
being there, or even on that server I can't say, but I have
never heard of a named spectre.
