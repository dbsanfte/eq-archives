That used to actually work.  Slowly and painfully, and with the resist
risk you mention.  But between the recast time on Lulls and the fix
to the duration, you don't have the luxury of casting that many before
the earliest wear off.  In almost all cases I've seen, a single Lull
will limit a pull to one or two.  And as easy as LDoN mobs are to tank
and kill, a two pull is often better than a single pull.

Oh, and I agree with you about the aggro/asist experience.  I've watched
at least half-a-dozen Warriors who are much better pullers than I am,
and I've seen and heard of plenty of Paladins who make my very mediocre
pulling look good.  Soon my best Lull will be useless due to level, with
luck I'll have learned enough by then to keep pulling for my groups.
