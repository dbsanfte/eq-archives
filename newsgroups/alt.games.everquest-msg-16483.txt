No wonder why I didn't get all the thread.  I don't have a huge amount of
time to catch up on the groups I read, and many postings and  threads get
fragmented.

Why does it bother you so much when someone ask a question, like Sim Pilot's
"What is uber" and my answer?  Is it the repetition?  Welcome to News
Groups.  I see the same questions asked hundreds of times in most groups.
That is why there are a lot of FAQs, or at least one reason.
