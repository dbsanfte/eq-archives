Because the evidence shows how EQ2 left all its competitors in the dust... 
oh, wait, that was a different game.   =P

They *are* different games.  Ironic that you snip out the rest that
discusses marketing when the point was that the marketing was done
completely and utterly wrong.

I've heard WoW compared to EQ more than EQ2 has been compared to EQ.  Beyond
the amusement value, it illustrates just how wrong you are.  All games have
flaws, EQ is no exception.  WoW was a "re-thinking" of the concepts behind
EQ, with a *stated* purpose to make another EQ but eliminate all of EQ's
flaws (of course, they created a whole new set of flaws, which was to be
expected).  But no, "no one new" plays WoW.  =)

That would be a helluva lot easier to sell if we weren't all aware that they
kept a lot of the flaws of EQ and created plenty of new ones too.  It's the
game design mindset behind EQ that creates what most consider to be the
flaws in EQ.  That mindset doesn't change with EQ2 (though to be fair, in
the face of considerable competition, that mindset has been forced to change
some in both games).

Sony had the truly idiotic idea that to avoid losing their existing
playerbase to WoW (among other competitors) they had to do something (the
something turned out to be EQ2).  Why they never considered all the
ramifications of that decision we may never know, but in the long run it
probably led to *more* people leaving EQ *and* EQ2 for WoW than if they had
just devoted themselves to their already-successful product, or at least
worked the "new" angle on a game rather than directly tying it to their
existing one.

I'm about 99.999% sure they didn't get what they wanted.  I think Blizzard
got what Sony wanted.   =P
