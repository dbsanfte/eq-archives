They could give every class in EQ the same rez spells clerics
get and clerics would still be in demand due to CHeal.  It's
just overpowering when compared to other priest's heals.

Rez is more like a druid's ports -- yeah, it's nice, but you could
usually get one w/o actually having to group with the druid for
longer than the port itself...   Hardly anyone wanted a cleric
rez until they got the 96% one anyway even if they were
grouped with a cleric with a lower-level one.
