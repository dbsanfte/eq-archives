Is it better than in eq2? Are there ideas the eq2 devs could use to improve
things?

What about the trading system? Do they have offline trading? One thing i
noticed about the current generation video cards is how much power they chew
through, causing my computer to blaze out heat. Leaving it on all the time
to trade seems environmentally irresponsible... heck, i reckon it could have
melted through a fair portion of the ice cap on it's own by now :*)

I was reading about graphics cards with independent power supplies. What's
next, an onboard petrol engine?

What about sound? Would you say the voices in eq2 are better than WOW? Is
the lore as deep?

I'm calling again to see if it's available, and i just hope that the servers
are accepting new players. I seem to be reading some contradictory answers
and the actual company is on another continent so i don't really want to
call their help line if i can avoid it.
