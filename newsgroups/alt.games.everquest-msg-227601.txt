Actually my favorite RTS of all time still has to be Warzone 2100. 
Everything since then has felt like a giant step backwards in user 
interface.

With 2100 I could run a multi-pronged attack, maintain unit production, 
rely on base defenses to hold up without continual intervention, rely on 
individual units to return to nearby repair bases for repair *and* 
return to their battle groups without my intervention, and not be 
perpetually farking around my base clicking on frightened harvestors...

It had some balance issues, and was vulnerable to early zerg like 
virtually all RTSes, and it was still a clickfest... but it felt 
productive... I wasn't always madly clicking on idiot units trying to 
get them to do something more useful than stand there, madly searching 
for units who had fallen out of a group and were sitting abandoned in 
the middle of nowhere, madly searching for harvestors who were hiding in 
corners... I was madly clicking because I had multiple armies engaging 
multiple fronts, while directing bomber runs, surgical vtol strikes, and 
monitoring the perpetual barrages of artillery and counter artillery 
striking accross the map... twas glorious :)

Your right, Warcraft 3 isn't quite the revolution it should have been... 
but if your looking for a quality revolution in a Warcraft clone like 
LoE... nuff said.
