I've never noticed any sort of built aggro because of AE stun (quite unlike
cleric stun, probably because of the damage aspect).

Unless castersrealm is wrong, all cleric stuns last 6 seconds.   At level 4
enchanters get a 4 second stun with a great casting time of 1 second.  For
crowd control purposes this gives the enchanter plenty of time to get off a
REAL AE stun (one plenty long enough to cast mez. All enchanter mezzes take
2.5 seconds to cast, but somehow the math just doesn't work out like you
think it should).

Level  4,  4 seconds    - 20 mana
Level 20, 6 seconds    - 40 mana
Level 44, 8 seconds    - 60 mana
Level 52, 8 seconds with mana drain - 125 mana (not many uses unless it
gives mana to the enchanter as some people claim)

Cleric (all last 6 seconds)

Level 5, 35 mana
Level 19, 60 mana
Level 34, 90 mana
Level 49, 120 mana
Level 55, 150 mana
Level 58, 200 mana

Recast time on all enchanter stuns are 12 seconds, clerics from 12 - 48
(mostly 24).  Not sure how the math works on that, but you can see how much
cheaper it is for enchanters to cast, considering their POSSIBLITY of
keeping a critter quiet longer.

Level 4 stun lasts 4 seconds, level 44 lasts 8 = 12 seconds stunned, and
since the recast time also happens to be 12 seconds it's possible that for
80 mana every 12 seconds the cleric won't have to worry about healing at
all. :)

Oddly enough I've run into one situation so far where I can't mez (actually,
I hadn't tried) but I HAVE been able to stun a critter.  Eh, I could be
wrong, but the stuns did seem to hit the giants in Burning Wood.  That's one
situation where you might find more than one critter awake.  It doesn't
happen often.

Quite frankly I do PRIMARILY use the stuns as crowd control measures to give
myself time to mez adds.  But, like you, there's times where I have more
mana than I need and it's time to use a little bit of mana to save clerics
mana.  Or to save a caster's life while a cleric frantically tries to get a
heal off  (over-nuking wizards/mages, or over-dotting necros).  Once I get
down to 40 mana I sit my butt down (enchanters generally don't need nearly
as much mana as clerics) unless the situation warrants me using all my mana
on stuns (quite a few even at 40% mana!!) to save my group's life (cleric
OOM or LOM after a train or bad pull, or evac'er needing time).
