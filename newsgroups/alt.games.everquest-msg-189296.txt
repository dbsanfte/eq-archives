I have the same problem.  When I wrote to Zone Labs, they told me to do what
you have done (which I had done already) and I wrote back that it didn't
work.  They said reinstall (which I had already done and didn't work, but
did again anyway) and that didn't work.  The last E-mail suggested that it
*should* be working and possibly try a full system reformat.
Bullshit.  I'm not reformatting so I can watch a simple animated gif's, not
that I should have to anyway.

Good luck finding an answer, I received no joy from the author.
