DoT's are generally high aggro procs.   I haven't used that weapon
personally, but I've been on raids where people were.    I'm not sure how it
is for holding aggro, but it can definitely gain it at times.

It can do worse than get you squished, bad aggro at the wrong time can mean
half the raid attacks through enrage, or pissed off rogues running back and
forth unable to backstab.

For the others, it's all a maybe, depending on what the main tank is
equipped with.   If he's relying on a fleshgrinder as his aggro weapon, you
using yours might cause problems.  If he has better hate weapons, Cord
Hilted Spike Driver, Warrior epic, anything with enraging blow, etc...  then
you've got nothing at all to worry about.

Bloodpoint should be completely safe.   It's not a very good aggro weapon
IMO.   The lifetaps didn't seem to me to generate much aggro at all.

Just bring along several sets of weapons, and make sure at least one set has
no procs on it.

Start with either the lance or the Fleshgrinder / Bloodpoint.     Most
likely the lance.   If you start to pull aggro a few times, swap in
fleshgrinder / bloodpoint after that fight.   If you're still pulling aggro,
swap in Weapon_that_doesn't_proc_01 and bloodpoint.     If you're still
pulling aggro...  maybe this isn't really a raid you want to be on. ; )
