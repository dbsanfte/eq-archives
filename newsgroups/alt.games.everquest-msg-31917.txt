Anyone who would bother to report someone's name not meeting Verant's naming
criteria is a
L                OO             SS      EEEE  RRR
L              O    O         S    S    E         R     R

I vehemently agree with anything religiously, sexually, ethnically offensive
being immediately reported and removed.  I also think that if someone plays
the game simply to "harass" others based on their names not being up to
code, should be removed just as well.
Have you gotten that hall monitor sash for your character yet?  I'll bet
you're still wearing yours from Jr. High, as that seems to be where your
mental and social growth came to a screeching halt.
Please move along off the name thing and play the damn game you fool.
