Oh, I don't know.  We're quite nice if we give you the chance to get to know
us.  And you can't deny we DO have some talented artists out there.  Our top
popular music band, "Dismembered Halfling" started their Nektulos Tour last
week to sell-out crowds at the Neriak City Hall - they're also booked to
make an appearance at the new leisure centre on Grim Street, Third Gate.

And poetry?  Teir'Dal wrote the BOOK on poetry, let me tell you.  What
self-respecting Dark Elf (or, as we prefer to call ourselves, 'proper'
elves), could forget that evocative classic "Thwsjckw weuagif wuwrghv"
(which sadly loses all its emotive power when spoken in languages other than
Dark).

And then you tell me we can't have bards.  Pah.
