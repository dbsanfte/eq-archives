My enchanter isn't a phantasmist, he's just a Beguiler (56) but since that
article has come out I've let my CHA drop for INT.  For a few months I've
been hovering around 140 CHA (up to 200 with buff & gear I carry around) but
I think I'm going to let it drop to about 110 to see if I notice a
difference.  I really noticed very little difference between 140 and 200.
