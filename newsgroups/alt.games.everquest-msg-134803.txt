Actually until the DTLA series (I think in the US it is called GXP), they 
IBM hds were the best and most reliable you could get. I myself still have 
a DPTA which yet has to fail on me, its one of the most reliable drives 
I�ve ever had. But since the introduction of the glass platters, their IDE 
drives seem to fail left and right (do a little bit of research on google 
groups if you don�t trust me and you will see the whole desaster). Usually 
a newer DTLA (maybe ICL as well) lasts about half a year til a year and 
then it develops scratching noises and loses sectors. After a while you 
have a total data loss. In my surrounding I had to replace about 10 drives 
(out of 11) because of that symptom within 12 months. IBM always has been 
fair and exchanged the drives unless you had an OEM one. But the problem is 
the echanged drives lack reliability as well. But so far there always have 
been numerous reports of consumers but no serious report about this in the 
press, except one or two sites. And about half a year ago a class action 
lawsuit regarding the GXP75 drives (here DTLA 75) was started, but as far 
as I could see other drive series were affected as well. Btw. if you 
wondered why IBM sold off the HD division and makes huge losses with their 
HDs nowadays this might be the reason. I�m not sure how big the return rate 
for those drives is but it must be rather huge.
