  Yes I have a low level monk but only after the nerf. I did know several
monks before nerf that did nothing but solo. They was the one's that was
pissed off so much. And yes they was the fungi wearing type guys you refer
to. Guess I was wrong at putting all monks in same boat but that's the one's
I was used to seeing.  =)
