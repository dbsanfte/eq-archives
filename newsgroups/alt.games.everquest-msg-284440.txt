I was sure you meant snared, and I figured it was likely you knew the 
term too... but its one of those hot button things, people who use the 
two terms interchangably can cause a lot of trouble.

Is the Guardian Wurm Slowed?  Yes.  Booom.  Umm, can I have a rez 
please?  What happened there?  Ah, the druid said it was slowed.  Did 
you mean snared?

I'll grant you the fun part.  My cleric used to melee a lot.  Even 
before the proccing hammers.  FM, everybody good on hp, why not?  And 
particularly if you're soloing, your pace is your own affair.
