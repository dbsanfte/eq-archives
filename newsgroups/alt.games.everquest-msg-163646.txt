    If you and a group of 5 to 11 friends had been working on the CoD and
HoH "personal quest" methods to get into those zones, you'd all be there by
now. Some places aren't like that - I have yet to hear of an individual
method of getting flagged for PoTactics, for example - but there's ways to
get in on some of these "awesome places" you want to get into. Making this
into an uberguild rant doesn't work.

    In Kunark, the rule was "look at the level of the mob you're fighting".
That told you what it could drop. But those mobs were placed in specific
places. For example, other than the raid-target dragons there was only one
"easy" place for high-end spells: Skyfire. And people crowded the zone
because of it, and whined about how crowded it was.

    In PoP, you have very specific "camps" where 63+ spells drop. The best
places, you need to work to get to. The only difference is now you can't
look at the level of the mobs and guess what they're going to drop, you need
to go there and start killing them.

    If you were 59 or 60. Sort of like how if you level up to 63+ those PoJ
trials start getting a lot easier. ;-)

    I agree that's tough. Like I said to Martin, casters don't feel complete
without their spells. Melees do, as they get meaningful intrinsic bonuses
when they level. In PoP, spell distribution is on a melee gear-like
distribution paradigm.

    Is it because those weapons are called "epic" and supposed to be special
somehow, or is it just a question of the ratios and stats on things like the
Windblades?

    They sell for 20 K because we fix the price. Look what they sell for
when two competing guilds get into the zone. On some servers Windblades
crashed to 10 K or less as people tried to get rid of them. We tried talking
to the one other guild about fixing Windblade prices at 65 K, but as soon as
a third guild got in they started free-falling again.

    I've received no benefits from HoH, because **I don't need any of that
stuff**! That, and the 63+ parchment drops aren't great enough that the
people that are there have full spellbooks and are passing spells down.
