What is EQ if not a big chatroom with some semi-fantasy action in the
background?  I really, really don't want to defend people who use plz
and thx, but it's damn hard to carry on a conversation when you only
have 3 seconds to type before you have to stop/start the next song for
your twist.

Sure, for requests, but not everything that requires please and thank
you is a request for a buff.  I would certainly hope that nobody would
get upset because I type 'back the damn pet off plz!!!' the 4th time
it breaks mez, or 'plz don't dot, breaks mez thx'.  Of course I do try
to type it out correctly, but it seems to end up closer to 'plz ond't
dot, my mze breaks!!11'  I could just hotkey it I guess, but I
generally hope that I don't end up grouping with people stupid enough
to necessitate a hotkey.
