The problem is not that the people at the top of any company are
stupid, it's that their interests and the company's interests are not
necessarily aligned.  Particularly recently the idea is to rise to the
top, collect bonuses, and then, regardless of how the company does,
move on to another job.

In other words, what the board of any company is doing may not be
stupid, but it may not be in the interest of their company either.

Although, getting back to the original point way back when, I agree
that the Sony board couldn't care less about whether wizzies are
overpowered...
