The first four, at least, although the 3rd and 4th require baking
and pottery to complete.   The 5th one requires tailoring and
also requires killing in Velks.   Velks wouldn't be fun with that
group.   Well, unless you consider a lot of CRs fun, of course.

The quests are given in Thurgadin and require you to be on
Coldain faction.   There's nothing in them, though, that'll make
you KoS beyond repair to other factions.   So, yes, you'll choose
sides but it's nothing that you can't change later.
