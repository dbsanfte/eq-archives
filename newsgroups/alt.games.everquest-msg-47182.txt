Lol, you must be a dr00d. First of all, the mob hitting a disposable pet,
who would be DSed btw, instead of a PC is bad why? Keeps the tank alive
doesn't it? Pet dies, who cares? Another one is there to take it's place. If
you have a mage in your group, your druid DS should not be cast on the main
tank. The mage's DS is better than yours. Duh.
