That's the *recent* incursions into Palestine houses.  I guess,
they were fed up with the bad press they got last time they
went in, and were under strict instructions not to be rough
with any civilians they met.

Still, it's nice that the army are polite to you when they occupy
your house, but would *you* want even the US Army coming
and taking over your house to turn your town into a war
zone?

He tried.  Bush got elected saying he wasn't going to get involved
with big peacekeeping missions - but it seems events have
conspired to drag him in anyway.  And, I guess I can't fault
Bush for effort either.  However, I do wish he'd get his
own opinion about the facts in Israel, rather than buying
everything Sharon says.

General Musharraf played a cool hand in a tricky situation
for him, and came out of it quite well, and with greater
respect from the US.  Good for him, I say.  Course, if
Bush was to believe what the _Indian_ leader says
about Pakistani terrorists, he might be treating Musharraf
like he treats Arafat.  But, luckily, he's more even
handed in that case.

I'm not quite sure what the "clenched sphincters" bit means, but
I don't think you can bash Bush for playing the neutral game
in Pakistan, while telling him that that's how he *should*
do it in Israel.  I think the point is that it's *easier* for Bush
and America to be even-handed with Pakistan and
India - there's no history there of support for one side over
the other.

This always bothered me about the Gulf war.  People said
"the US didn't bother about Israel when it went against
UN resolutions - why should it get so agitated about
Iraq invading Kuwait".  I kinda thought that if America
had so often got things wrong, it ought to be praised,
rather than blamed, for finally getting something right - and
so what if oil supplies was also a motivating factor?

Well, you've got to at least give Musharraf the *chance* to sort
it out for himself, before you start making allies into enemies.
