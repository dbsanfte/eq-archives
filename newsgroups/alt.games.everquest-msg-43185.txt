I would suggest getting a high-level to drag them away from the camp right
before you make the courier spawn.  You're bound near the camp, and gating
in after you make him spawn?

Or, if you can't find a high-level, get a buddy to create a new Gnome Necro
( HIE Mage, etc...), escort him to the area, and have him send in his pet
and then run like hell.  Hopefully, the baddies will destroy the pet and
then take off after the necro.  Not sure if this will work or if a lvl 1
Necro can stay alive near that camp long enough to get him to spawn.  Heck,
just grab 4 bags or so of CB belts and get him to level 4 first =)
