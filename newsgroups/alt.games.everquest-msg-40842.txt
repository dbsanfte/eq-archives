World Trade Centre collapses after hijack planes attack
(Filed: 11/09/2001) 

BOTH towers of the World Trade Centre have collapsed after terrorists
launched a bloody and brutal assault on the American nation, hijacking
three planes and smashing them into New York's twin towers and the
Pentagon in Washington DC. �

Hundreds are feared dead in the suicide attacks, which caused the two
110-storey WTC towers to collapse into the streets of New York. 

A fourth plane has crashed 80 miles south-east of Pittsburgh. There was
also a car bomb outside the State Department in Washington DC.

A stunned US president George Bush promised a 'full-scale investigation
to hunt down and find those folks who committed this act'. 

He said: "Terrorism against our nation will not stand.".

The scenes of unbelievable destruction were thought to have been caused
by Middle Eastern terrorists.�

Abu Dhabi television said that it had received a call from the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine claiming responsibility
for crashing two planes into the twin WTC towers overlooking New York
harbour. 

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has condemned the attacks.

The West Wing of White House was evacuated after the attack on the
Pentagon in Washington, the heart of the US military machine. 

The first attack came just before 9am local time (2pm UK time) when a
jet airliner smashed high into one of the WTC towers from the south. 

About 18 minutes later, as witnesses described the horror, a second
airliner flew in from the same direction, hitting the other tower. 

The crash was shown live on CNN. President Bush was in Sarasota,
Florida, reading to a classroom full of children when his chief-of-staff
Andrew Card whispered into his ear. 

The president briefly turned sombre before he resumed reading. He then
flew back to Washington for an emergency meeting of the National
Security Council. 

Casualties are expected to run into thousands. CNN reported that one of
the planes was a Boeing 767, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to
Los Angeles. The plane can carry up to 300 passengers. 

Both planes remained embedded in the 110 storey towers with smoke and
flames pouring out of the gaping holes. A senior government official
said the FBI is pursuing reports that all of the planes were hijacked
and that the crashes were the result of suicide missions.

The WTC towers, where 50,000 work everyday, were struck by bombers in
February 1993. The tops of the towers were obscured by smoke.

Thousands of pieces of what appeared to be office paper came drifting
over Brooklyn, about three miles from the tower, one witness said.

An eyewitness said the first plane appeared to hit one of the
skyscraper's twin towers about 20 floors from the top. 

He said he thought the plane was still embedded in the smashed and
burning building.

Another said it appeared that the first plane lined up on the tower
before crashing. Jeanne Yurman, told CNN she was watching TV when she
heard what she thought was a sonic boom. "I thought it was Concorde,"
she said. 

James Winter, 30, a British worker living in an apartment close to the
centre, said he had been woken by a huge bang at around 8.50am local
time. "I was in bed and there was a huge explosion. The whole building
rattled and shook.

"I ran to the window and there was smoke billowing from the south side
of one of the towers. Everyone in my building was panicking and running
around." 

Mr Winter, from Darlington, Co Durham, who works in one of the towers,
added that shortly afterwards there was a second explosion which also
shook his building. 

"Everybody is saying that this a terrorist attack and everyone around
here is panicking.

"It will have been really busy with people arriving for work in the
financial district. It is just unbelievable that this is happening. Both
towers have been taken out. I just can't believe this is happening." 

Meanwhile, some companies at Canary Wharf, home of Britain's tallest
building, have been evacuated.
