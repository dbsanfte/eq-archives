That's as a shaman or one of your other classes?

I heartily wish that I could med to full in two and a half minutes. As a 53
cleric I med maybe a *bubble* of mana that quickly.

KEI cuts my time to med to full by about 40%.

However, as a cleric KEI is rarely needed outside of certain Planar groups.
Useful while soloing, of course. Its main advantage is to *standing* mana
regen.

Personally I get a KEI under the following circumstances:
- when it's free :-)
- raids
- Plane of Innovation groups
- Other Planar groups when there is no slower
- Sometimes when soloing. This depends on expected cash returns (I
  *hate* exping at a loss).
