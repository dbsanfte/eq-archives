Well, going to 1/10th would be silly.  But you could make it so 1250 is less effective than it is
now, but 1600 is more effective than it is now, for example, so warriors would end up being better
tanks... but rangers and other light tanks would not end up as good as they are now.

Just lifting the cap without doing any tuning at all might end up with warriors trivializing
content entirely, I think thats the fear that put the cap in place in the first place.

I think the AC system crys out for a more radical change than simply lifting the cap and tinkering
with effectiveness, though, I'd like to see it altered over the whole range from level one to level
65, and from AC 0 to AC 2000.  At the moment, only about 200 AC makes any difference... which 200
depends on the mob, but going from say 200 to 400 will make no difference at all against a level 60
mob, nor will going from 1000 to 1200 against a level 30 mob.

But the "holy trinity" is cleric/chanter/warrior... and I'm saying warriors are not favored by this
change.  If anyone is favored by the monk nerf, its rogues, since they retain all their sponging
capability, all their damage output capability, and monks are no longer as desirable as they once
were.

I'm not sure what they are suggesting they want here, nor do I think they know.  One possibility is
"sic the warrior on the mob and nuke like crazy"... ending the fight faster so your healers don't
run out of mana.   Apparantly thats not it, though, given that they killed MB as a "massive damage
fast" producer. Another possibility is "set up a sponge chain, so each tank takes his turn
defending"... but this is only the equivalent of adding (number of tanks) Cheals, not nearly as
good as adding in even one cleric, who has at least 10 Cheals in him with no mana regen at all,
which would turn your 60 man group into a 120 man group.

A) mage sics pet on target.  B) Mage can do other things in 90% of the game, its only in the hard
fights that he is restricted to mod production.  C) every class can be described this way in a hard
fight: this is your job, do it, and nothing else.  C1) clerics: heal tank, eat rods, heal tank.
See what I mean?  C2) MA warrior: get aggro, keep aggro, do damage if you can.  Fun?  C2a) non MA
warrior.  Do damage if you can but whatever you do don't get aggro.  C3) Enchanter: keep everything
that is mezable mezed.  Try not to have an anuerism.  C4) Shaman: Slow mob.  Loot your body so it
doesn't clutter up the chanter field of vision  C5) Ranger Loot your body so it doesn't clutter up
the chanter field of vision... the list goes on and on, but I can't think of a class that is doing
dozens of different things in a real hard raid fight, fights like this are about finding your role
and sticking to it, so you are a cog in an interlocking machine that grinds up the target and spits
him out.

You talk about grouping here, but most of this change applies to major raids, not to small group
actions.  Mage mana production drops off some, but the non-stacking part of this doesn't apply to
groups with one mage.  CHeal nerf isn't likely to mean much to a exp group.  Monk nerf...well thats
gonna hurt a bit, but exp group monks probably won't be pulling stuff that kills em dead if they
have less effective AC, since that stuff is also likely to chew up a six man group pretty hard;
whether it kills them or not, you don't want to take your cleric down to OOM every fight in an exp
group at high levels, waaaaay too much sitting around.
