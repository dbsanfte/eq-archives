Level 60 is a breeze compared to any level near it, either above or 
below.  As to advice, head to PoP.  At level 61, you should be able to do 
fine in PoJ, even without slowed mobs (I think).  Better yet, get a group 
in Valor or Nightmare or Disease.  Valor or courtyard in Disease are 
probably your best bets, with Valor being easier to find a group I think.
