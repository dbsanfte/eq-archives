Hey! I wasn't complaining.... I was commenting. I'm happy to a enjoy
EQ as it is, but that doesn't stop me discussing it's shortcomings.

Anyway, the difference between EQ and a pen 'n' paper rpg is huge.
Look at it this way: in a pen 'n' paer rpg, your actions affect the
world around you. You can CHANGE things. In EQ, you can kill mobs. And
that's about it. Sure, you can interact with other players, but you
are very limited in how you interact with the world. I guess that's
the crux of my argument.
