It's been about 6-7 months since I last played the game. At the time,
things were -really- looking bad for the game, what with the Woody-led
boycott for the OOW expansion and the "Guild Summit" and such. I
generally lost complete interest in the game.

Now that I have my own business, and my days consist of sitting around
with a lovely computer and of course, broadband, I've found myself
getting bored enough to entertain the thought of returning to EQ.

However, I'm worried. Is it essentially the same game? Have the
dynamics changed, has the economy continued to spiral out of control?
How bad have the populations gotten serverwide?

I'm assuming most of the people I played with have gone on to better
things, that's a given. If I do return, I probably won't be using my
65 cleric as my main.

Any other things I'm not considering? Thanks.
