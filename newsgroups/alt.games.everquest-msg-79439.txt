  Why did they bother changing the skeletons?  :\  Though I like most
of the new Luclin models that I've seen of the races, the elementals,
and especially wolves... I just don't see the point in them having
changed the appearance of skeletons (for everyone, without even
leaving the option to keep the old ones).

  I like the old ones because, for one, they had animations that
worked and looked good.  The new ones still don't appear to have an
animation for using 2hp weapons, and they don't have a special "bash"
animation like the old one did.

  I miss the glowing eyes.

  I miss brown and red boned skeletons.  Now they're all boring white,
which actually puts us at a gameplay disadvantage since it's more
difficult, at a glance, to tell if the mob you're about to pull is a
necromancer or a shadow knight, or if that skeleton is a dread corpse
of a decaying one.

  I guess some might argue that the new ones look better, though I
think that's a matter of judgement.  They look "smoother" and
"cleaner" which I don't think is an entirely good thing for skeletons.

  They could've improved skeletons in a few other ways that would've
been nice, but didn't... like given them armor textures.  I'd like to
equip a skeleton pet in some raw hide or patchwork and have it have
sort of a 'decaying leather' look, or rusty ringmail.  It'd increase
the size of global file a bit, but they did that anyway, and they
could always allow people to disable it.

  Or they could've made racial skeletons.  Dwarf/gnome skeletons look
stupid, they're just shrunken versions of the normal skeleton model
that aren't proportioned correctly at all.  And then there's the
cyclops skeletons with two eye sockets.  This wouldn't necessarily
increase the global file since only certain zones have those mobs.

  Ah well, no big deal.  I just like the old ones a lot better.
