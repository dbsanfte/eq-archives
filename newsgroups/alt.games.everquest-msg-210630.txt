When I got the rygorr chief down to 8% health he deathwalked into the wall
and apparently fell under the world.  I didnt get his head and so lost all
the work I did up to that point (7 rings worth).  It's been petitioned
(twice) and bugged but almost a week later I'm losing hope that they will
see it my way.  Best to have snare or root ready before he deathwalks.
