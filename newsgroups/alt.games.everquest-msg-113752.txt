Great if you are one of the lucky ones, tough if you aren't.
I quite like that idea, basically because I wouldn't want to be a Jedi if
you could by choice (everyone else would be in the same way that there was a
influx of Wood Elf Rangers after LotR) although I can see the auctions on
EBay (or whatever) Now "SWG account for sale, contains one Force active
character - Bidding starts at US$1000"

To tell the truth, Phantom Menace was such a let down (it viewed as poor
imatation of the original) that I am not in the least excited by AotC or the
SWG game but don't get me started on that.

I'll try it when it is released but I'm more interested in EQ2 than SWG.

I expect a sudden appearance of misspelled Names of Dooku, Jango and Zam
after May16.
