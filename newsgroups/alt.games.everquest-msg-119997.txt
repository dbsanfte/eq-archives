That is the most horribly written attempt to clarify anything
I've read since I had to work with IBM "reference" manuals.
That poster is attempting to change the words people use to
describe haste.  Instead of a few sentences describing how the
commonly quoted haste values relate to game mechanics, he goes
rambling off in a fashion guaranteed to confuse most of his
readers.  His post has negative value, you do the readers of this
group a disservice by referring them to it.
