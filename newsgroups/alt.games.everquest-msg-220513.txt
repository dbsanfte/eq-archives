<whine> But I *like* SG-1. Hehe. We're just catching
up on it, really. We didn't get to see it when it
was on one of the pay channels with occasional showings
on 'regular' TV at 3am on Sunday mornings. We've caught
the last, what, two, three seasons since it's been on
the SciFi Channel, but missed the beginning years. Our
MO is to make shtoopid comments all the way through
the show. Actually, that's our MO for *anything* we
watch. Our own version of MST.
