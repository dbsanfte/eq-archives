Thanks, I went back last night and inserted disk 1 of the Luclin set, from
there you can uninstall the new and improved old world textures, and
reinstall the originals. Once I logged back in, it felt like my old computer
again. Nice to know that there is a way to fix that, with out fully
uninstalling the expansion, might need to get some spells or something up
there. ;-)
