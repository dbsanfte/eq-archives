Because if they want that item they now have to go camp it themselves . No
more buying from someone else .

There will no longer ever be high level characters in the zone to deal with
bad trains or catastrophically bad decisions or even just very bad luck.

It takes a group of appropriate level characters days and many deaths to
explore . High level characters do it faster and put the results on the net
. Net result is that newbies will have no clue of where to go get equipment.

It encourages the creation of level appropriate farmers with multiple
computers . A really hideous breed of miscreant I want nothing to do with .

It destroys the role playing enviroment . If this game is reduced to just a
video game then it rots , there are many really high quality video games
available and eq just cant make the cut as a video game .

And the number one reason ! It pisses me off if even just once I want a
piece of equipment or a quest item from a lower level zone that I cant go
get . If I get pissed off I leave . If enough people are like me then the
game folds and the precious newbie we are oh so trying to protect gets to
play alone .

P.s . Its also very true that there isnt a problem to begin with . All these
reasons are negative and try as hard as I can I can see no positives for
trivial loot code that are not already handled by reputation and the play
nice policy . This leaves me in a quandry about why anyone wants it . The
only reasons understandable to me are greed and envy .
