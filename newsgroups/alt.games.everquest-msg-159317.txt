Idiocy is an innate feature of the brain.  I can't stop.  However, top
posting is merely a bad habit that can easily be trained away.

I can't stop fucking, either, however, I can get a vasectomy so at least I
won't breed more idiots.  How you are going to stop being an asshole I don't
know.

In my defense, I really wasn't trying to flame the OP, just offer some
friendly advice.  You know, don't top post, don't post Me Too, that sort of
thing, simple newsgroup etiquette tips.
