Yes, I am, won't deny it (especially since I agree with the post 100%)
but I should make it clear I was passing this post along, I didn't
write it. Your hostility towards it, however, seems to indicate it
struck a nerve....

It was a note towards those who made enchanters just for the plat or
to give themselves clarity whenever they wanted it.

The implication is that someone who hotkeys extended buffs is one of
the aforementioned chanter buffbots, not a real enchanter.

He is remarking he is willing to degrade efficiency if it is apparent
the group can't handle an enchanter at full bore.

He is remarking that an astonishingly large number of people do things
that are not necessary with an enchanter around and indeed detract
from the experience and also usually put said enchanter in danger. No
other class rewards good group play and risks so much from bad group
play as enchanter, who is almost always the first to go down to
another person's stupidity (generally followed quickly by the cleric,
then everyone else, the stupid person last).

Sadly, this attitude (which is more common with enchanters than many
would admit) has been reinforced over and over, and its getting worse
as the mudflation effect nullifies the need for skill more and more up
to and including the midgame and early endgame.

There are many many other people playing other classes that do great
with enchanters, who assist etc. But the enchanter, who is the best
force multiplier combined with opponent neutralizer in the game,
requires the most getting used to to play well with.

The enchanter does. As evidenced by a recent post here, there are
people in the midtier PoP planes who haven't learned these lessons
yet, and their ignorance usually kills the enchanter first.

After this long playing, it becomes more and more apparent that the
battle to educate the up and comers is a losing one. This has been
going on since the very beginning and it just keeps getting more and
more emphatic - the better players recognize this and thats why they
rarely stray outside of their guild groups, where they *know* they
won't have people who couldn't assist if their lives depended on it.

The follies of the standard pickup group would probably make the
longest post in newsgroup history.

Nnow I don't need to be assuming the role of the author to tell you
you're making a mistake. I don't give a rats ass if it looks like its
unmezzed or looks like its still walking, ASSIST THE FUCKING MAIN
ASSIST USING YOUR HOTKEY. If you are manually targetting mobs and
you're not crowd control or MA, you're screwing up.

Stopping him from doing so. It's the enchanter's job. A tank that
turns around to deal with it never ceases to piss me off. IT'S NOT
YOUR PROBLEM. Leave it to me, I actually have the abilities meant to
handle it and they more or less aren't compatible with yours. It's
what the enchanter does.

Yes, it does.

"Crowd Control Professional" ie, enchanter.

It doesn't surprise me, you strike me as the sort who does not learn
well. Meanwhile the well played enchanter has controlled that overpull
and the group is happily killing them. Had you and your "I don't
listen to enchanters" attitude been there you probably would have
broken six mezzes and killed everyone within a hundred feet.

Some mistakes are more avoidable than others. Some people seem to make
mistakes they should have learned from. The enchanter wants to mez
mobs as fast as possible to maximize healer efficiency and minimize
risk. Sometimes that means they get the wrong mob targetted on pull.
Unlike when someone else breaks a mez, however, when the MA does it it
rarely hurts the enchanter since they are going all out on aggro
anyways. Or in other words, this enchanter mistake does not kill
groupmates. The mezbreaker who does not learn, on the other hand,
does.

Why should the MA be clicking anywhere?

Only a bad one would be doing so.

All mistakes can be forgiven... once. Enchanters have learned the hard
way that way too many players do not learn. This post is an attempt to
address that.

Actually, as per the original author, its just a vent, he is
apparenetly much more docile in game. But the message should get
through.

99 times out of 100 the enchanter will take precedent over the MA. A
good enchanter can tie down half a dozen or more mobs long enough to
not only see the main tank die, but also zone, get rezzed, zone again,
loot up, buff up, lose death effects, and get ready to start again.

But once you lose the enchanter, all bets are off.

It IS situational, yes. But its funny just how many of those
situations involve saving the enchanter first.

Please say that again. You obviously have never seen the power of a
CoD pet.

Two enchanters in ornate/VT gear and a druid can take out Overseer in
tactics. It takes three groups of people in similar (pre-elemental)
gear to do him otherwise. An enchanter and druid pairing can win the
mountain trials in GoD via a single pet in a quarter of the time it
takes a full group doing it the old fashioned way (assuming the
enchanter survives it).

And you have the gall to say other people are in shitty groups? Your
inexperience is showing, friend, when you start scoffing at pets that
parse dps >2000

I agree with that; charm is too risky to do if the group doesn't want
to. But the author agrees with that as well.

It is a nod towards certain people who are shocked the enchanter
doesn't keep every utility spell imaginable up.

In five years of EQ I can say I have noticed the most situationally
aware class in the game is enchanter (and for the record I have never
played one as a main, though I have twice as an alt, so this is not
chestthumping). Therefore the odds suggest the enchanter will know
better than anyone else which spells will be most useful, all else
being equal. Not always, but the odds favor it.

Saying its okay for someone to make sure they remind the enchanter
that haste drops even by saying "haste, bitch!" is aggression?

Your reading comprehension needs some work. This paragraph was a nod
towards your viewpoint and you still took it as an affront.

Yes I disagreed to a slight degree with that part; I am not fond of
battle spam in general (I don't give a shit if you're taunting or
nuking or whatever! Believe me I assume you are and I will notice if
you're not!) but a mez message is a good one, along with heals. This
was one of the few parts of the message that was unpopular with the
folks at eqlive.

No. I agree with him fully. The risks may be different but the general
situation remains the same. Just because the numbers are higher
doesn't mean you suddenly start breaking mezzes and panicking and
acting like a noob.

That is music to the ears of an enchanter. The best enchanters would
love to see that kind of discipline in any group. And that's what it
is - discipline and experience.

On the other hand, I am bright enough to know when someone is posting
an original piece, and when someone is quoting a piece from someone
else. Therefore, I find your judgement in this matter something less
than concerning. :-)
