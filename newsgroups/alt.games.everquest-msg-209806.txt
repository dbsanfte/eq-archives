No idea, but usually with these type of limited level/faction quests you can
talk to him first and if he doesnt give you the quest dialogue then you know
you cant do the turnin.  You can also try looking it up at
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ .  They have the most quest info of any
site I found.
