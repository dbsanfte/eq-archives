News flash....The US has not acted alone for the last 100+ years in
the ME. There is plenty of blame to go around. Just because the US is
leading the way in cleaning up the mess, doesn't mean they created it
all by themselves. (just like WWI and WWII all over again)

The snake has many heads. There has been no evidence the BL is even
still alive for several months now. Al Qeda assests have been seized
and frozen in world banks. The remnants of Al Qeda and the Taliban are
in hiding, and most of BLs top "generals" are either dead or captured.
Which end of the snake do you think is being cut off?

>that means going after the problems that cause the leaders to rise.
>Those reasons are political.

Wrong. The reasons run much deeper and ecompass politics, economics
and religion. The reasons span back throughout the entire history of
"Western" involvement in the region.

No, I am pointing out the fact that religion can cloud the mind,
destroy independant thought, and lower inhibitions like a strong
narcotic. Creating perfect little suicide-homicide soldiers. I never
said focus on the end user. I am implying that the focus should be on
the "supplier" (radical Islam and those that use it for polital
means).

Believing that the problem is solely the result of US involvment is
veiled "anti-Americanism".

By taking part in the political and economic struggles of the ME the
US has put itself at the top of the hate list. You assertion that they
would not be on the list at all if they had stayed out is erroneous.
The list is long and all of the big names in Europe are on it.

No, they point out that there are more reasons than just oil. The
situation is far to complex to label "oil" as the motivating force
behind US presence or current/future actions.

Wrong.

The UN is choosing the same solution that England and France chose
after WWI. Economic sactions are starving the people (because SH will
never comply), and strengthening SH's iron grip on the country. If
anyone is repeating the mistakes made in the Treaty of Versaille it is
the UN.

The US is doing what England and France should have done prior to
WWII. They are taking out the threats (nations that harbor, support
and encourage terrorism and the terrorist infrastructure itself).
Starting with the destruction of the Taliban and continuing with the
removal of SH from power.

>at least 50 million people killed.

It was US Presdent Wilson that tried to prevent those conditions
through the inept League of Nations. It will be the current US
President that will have to do the same in spite of an inept UN.
Western Europe has a long history of ignoring problems until they are
staring down the barrel of a loaded gun.

>Will history repeat itself? It's still early enough to avoid it. The

Wrong again. The "Bin Laden" monster has been created. You cannot
appease him (or SH...others like them) just like no one could appease
Hitler by allowing him to take back pieces of Germany lost in WWI.
Appeasing only shows weakness and encourages further aggression.

>You grossly underestimate the US's role in why they hate you. It
>wasn't unilateral.

You grossly overestimate the US's role, and you completely ignore
every other Western nation that has implemented economic policies in
the ME. Their hatred for the US is the end result of a brewing hatred
for "Western" culture that spans back to the crusades. (wow, back to
France and England again...who would have thought)

The US never dominated the region through colonization, nor did the US
rape and pillage the area durring the crusades hundreds of years
prior. The US didn't create Israel (the UN did). 

The fact you seem incapable of excepting is that they hate *ALL*
outsiders with a xenophobic passion. It is too late to assign blame
and too shortsghted to lay the problem at the feet of the US. Don't
let the fact that the US is on the top of thier "hate" list blind you
to the truth.
