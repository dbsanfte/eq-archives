I went on my first-ever raid yesterday (helping my guild take down a mob
for the SK epic 2.0), and in going back over the logs to review the event
I noticed at one point I got a critical hit (for all of 35, whee).  This
struck me as unusual, so I went back and checked my logs, and sure enough,
this appears to be the ONLY time my monk has gotten a critical hit.  I'd
just sort of assumed that monks didn't ever do critical hits, frankly.

So now I have to wonder, what is it that led to me getting the crit?  I
know that high DEX matters; I don't remember what my DEX was on the raid,
but it's usually 125 so was probably 195 due to Focus of the Seventh.  Is
that all it takes to get crits, or could there have been other effects
going on that contributed?
