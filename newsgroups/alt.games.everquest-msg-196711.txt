I agree. The zones are fun. I spent quite a bit of time at Dulak, and
had a blast (and the jiggling trolls may make you burst out in
laughture). Theres some decent drops here and a few quests. I was
hoping for more zones, but the 5 they give are fun (havent been to
Hates fury however). Some complain that this should have been free. In
my opionion, its worth it.
