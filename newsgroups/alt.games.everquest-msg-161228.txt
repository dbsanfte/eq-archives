Hi all. I'm new to the game, only have been playing 3 days.  I bought the
Trilogy and SoL.  I see posts and have heard people talk about the Bazzar
and would like to know how you access this.  Is it just a channel or a
place?  How does one go about looking at items for sale or posting items to
sell through a vendor?  I have looked at a few EQ sites and could not find
the info.  If someone could explain, mail me, or even post a link to the
info i would appreciate it.

Thanks
