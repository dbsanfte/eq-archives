Attempting to start a discussion on standard must have types of gear.
Items that can help in various situations, but stuff you may not wear
at all times.  May it be a Raid Gear Kit, or just a particular
Location Gear Kit.  Stuff that no character (in the upper levels say
46 plus) should be with out for very long.  Preferably looking for
Unlimited charges, but not necessarily only unlimited, and preferably
All/All or as close to universal usage as possible.


Example is:  Enduring Breath items.  We have all been there, when EB
runs out, and you have to depend on someone else to cast it on you, or
hell even if your the caster, it makes one less thing to worry about,
and one more spell slot open.  
 Some common ones I see are. 
   Shissar Eye Earring
   Fishbone Earring

Resist Gear:  The standard set that anyone can get their hands on.
Yes some Wis, Int, Str, Sta, HP will be sacrificed in the time being
but. the resists are a needed thing.
  These items can be used by all/all  
    2 x Velium BD Bracer
    1 x Gold Diamond Mask
    2 x Velium Diamond Rings
    1 x Gold Blue Diamond Choker
    2 x Electrum Blue Diamond Earrings


Clicky items: Invis, not sure what else would be a universal usage
item 

What else can there be?
