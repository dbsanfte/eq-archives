Better idea:  if you haven't posted it here yet, let us know what server
you're on.  There are lots of helpful folks around here and someone might
even hook up with you (or be established and filthy rich already) on the
server you're currently playing on, and be able to lend a hand getting you
pointed in the right direction.  Also, don't be affraid to /ooc for help
among your players in the game.  Most of the time, some kind soul will
overhear your pleas for help and come to your assistance.
