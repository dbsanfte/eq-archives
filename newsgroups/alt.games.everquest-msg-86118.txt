When you get it, you'll fall in love with it.  It casts relatively
quickly, is fairly easy on the mana, has an excellent hit point/mana
ratio, and, best of all, because it's a heal over time it causes next
to no aggro.  I like to use it on the puller as he comes running in;
that's how little aggro it causes.

You're not really at the level yet where CHeal becomes a necessity.
But in the circumstances where you've got some bigass warrior with 3
or 4 thousand hit points getting and keeping the aggro for fight after
fight, CHeal is invaluable; saves a bunch of mana.
