At 62, I have yet to refuse to group with a druid, or, any other class for 
that matter, for any reason other than a definite need for a different 
class in order to have a reasonable chance at hunting in a particuar spot, 
or, because I already know the person is an ass, and I don't want to group 
with them regardless of class.  I do have some friends that play druids, 
and, sadly, I can report that they do have difficulty getting groups at the 
higher levels.
