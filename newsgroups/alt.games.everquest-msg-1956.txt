Ok, so you went and got SoV knowing it had 16 new zones, you bought it and
found out that the whole (100%) of the CD wasn't the SoV exp and now
throwing a fit over it?  Or you went into the store picked up the box turned
it over read the box.  "16 perilous new zones including: ice caves, crystal
caverns, crypts, dungeons and frozen towers", and figured it'd fill up the
whole CD?
Sorry but what they said on the back of the box is what you got, they didn't
lie to ya PLUS you got two free games, stop whining about it.  Did EQ or RoK
fill up 100% of their CD's?  Hell no they didn't, so why should SoV, matter
of a fact does any game out there fill up 100% of the CD they are on, no
they don't.  Be happy you got it, play it and have fun don't like the two
free games then don't install them.  If you did install them then remove
them from your computer.
Whining over getting what you paid for plus something free, sad.

> I bought an expansion CD and expected the entire CD to be that expansion.
> What is so unreasonable about that expectation?
