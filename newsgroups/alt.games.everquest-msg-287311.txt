EQ2 has this same idea - eventually, i think, nearly all spells get
replaced, but it might not be for 15 levels (and sometimes the older
version of the spell might be more powerful than the newer version of
the spell, until the newer one scales up also).

That is FREAKING awesome. Helping your new friends in the same old
newbie zones sure wasn't fun, as far as games go.

And EQ2 has this same concept. It's proportional - if you're 10 and
being mentored by a lvl 40, you have a stronger ally. If you're being
mentored by a lvl 70+, your ally is basically a demi-god. It's a good
system. The mentee also gains a bonus to experience, in addition to
the indirect bonus of basically being powerleveled.

It should *definitely* be in EQ1. The monster missions are a cheap
workaround. Why not just let it happen directly?
