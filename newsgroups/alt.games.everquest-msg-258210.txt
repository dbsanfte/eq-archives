    Actually since the warrior de-nurfs lately for agro, Taunt is a FAR more
effective tool than it used to be, and an SK that loses agro should be
hitting his taunt key immediately.

    RE Taking agro from an SK, it is best to rudely taunt him for letting
the side down as you do so. Might I suggest "HOLD AGRO YA N00B" or perhaps
"has anyone NOT had a turn tanking?"

James
