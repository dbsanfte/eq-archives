Okay, this could be a really short question, but for the sake of the fact
that I ain't been here for months I thought I'd string it out a bit by
explaining why I want to know what I want to know.  You will all get bored
and think "why do we need to know this".  But any answers will be
appreciated anyway.

I want to write a letter to a friend of mine.  We've been discussing
religion, as she has a particular interest in paganism and Wicca at the
moment and has asked me for some information (I'm pagan, but ditched Wicca a
long time ago when I actually found out something about it).  I wanted to
write quite a long letter, to answer her questions in some detail.  And,
frankly, I'm pretty useless at just sitting in front of a screen and
writing.

So what I wondered was, for the sake of sitting somewhere nice (albeit
virtual), could I use EQ's /note command, with its big window and
everything, to type my letter out while I take in the wondrous scenery of
Norrath?  I mean, how big a note can you type at once?  Is any of the note
actually sent to the server, or just straight into a file?  Would my letter
be sent over the net at any stage?  Can GMs, guides, or other players read
what I'm typing in any way?  I don't ask because I'm going to write anything
contentious, beyond the fact that I'm likely to make references to
real-world religions and so on and don't want to intrude on anyone's fantasy
game time with real stuff like that.

The simple answer would be to just use a word processor like anyone else,
and I'll do that if doing the above would be impractical.  Just wondered
'cos I've never really explored the /note tool much, but I know I could take
the end result .txt and print it after a little editing...

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
