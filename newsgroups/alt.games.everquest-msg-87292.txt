Doh! Don't mention the whiskers to me...
I was well into the 4th shawl or already had it, was hunting
giants at the fort in GD for others to get their 1st and 2nd,
and looted this "one more crappy lore item nobody knows
what it's good for anyways" of yet another greenish wolf,
and DESTROYED it!
I was screaming when I read on eqtraders that it was
a rare drop for the 6th shawl....

So far:
(Smithing irrelevant, but to show off: 175)
Jewelcraft: 170 (2.7kpp and that for a non-enchanter :(
Brewing: 168
Fletching: 160
Baking: 140something
Tailoring: 114 (Last 12 combines for quivers only got me two raises :(
Fishing: Somewhere in the 50s, will do...

Just last night I got the 15 crystalline silk fibers from Velks in a 3 hour
session
"aiding" people with Dots, never actually getting into a group.
Now it's hunting season for wurm biles :(

Off now to kick some wurms asses,

     Maliciosa Do'Urden, 50th season DEF necromancer of AB,
        proud member of United Kingdoms, the upcoming uberguild of the
server ;)
