The 9500 has the advantage of being fully DirectX 9.0 (the other will work
under 9, just not have all the features DirectX 9.0 wants).

I have an 8500 and I think it's a nice card. Never had a day of trouble out
of it. Runs EQ and the two DX9.0 required beta test games I'm in just
peachy, and it's not even the full DirectX 9.0 chipset.

I imagine you can  probably shave a few bucks by getting the GeForce, just
because of card maker competition.

If you are not in a hurry you might want to wait till the 9600 Pro is on the
shelves (should be less than a month), it should be a similar price and
slightly better performance.

I have heard a few people claim horror stories Re: ATI and drivers on
Radeons, but have not had any bad experiences myself, and I put ATI cards in
machines here at work all the time. nVidia's drivers are generally top notch
as well. I've had a few bad experiences with nVidia cards but those are
usually the result of the motherboard drivers, more specifically needing a
VIA 4in1 update.

Finally, I will admit to being biased due to some... issues with nVidia in
the past, and they don't get my personal business anymore. Just to put my
recommendations in perspective.
