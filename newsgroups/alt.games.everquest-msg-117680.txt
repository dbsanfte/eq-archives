As I say above, I already have the instruments.  I don't
have the songs, but thats another "send the porter"
job, no need to actually go myself.  I was thinking in
terms of quests or good bardic fights or heck, maybe
the trainer offered a skill noone else does (like the
guy upstairs in Freeport who is the only Instill Doubt
trainer)

The trip is not completely safe, actually, as you
overlook Twilight Sea which has some see invis
mobs in it.  Still those are also easily avoided,
heck once I got Selos I probably could have
made the run from Shar Val to Katta, while the
bats and wolves do see invis they aren't any
harder to evade than the spiders in Firiona Vie
