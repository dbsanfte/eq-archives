If youre 50+ then you should be able to handle most of whats in UP. Most of
the mobs summon, a lot cant be mezzed. Id suggest pulling to the ZL until
youre confident you can handle the mobs, and an add. Radir is a nice easy
raid that you might be able to handle. Hes in a cave, just past the
elementals when you follow the right wall. Kill him and his spirit spawns,
and thats what has the loot.
