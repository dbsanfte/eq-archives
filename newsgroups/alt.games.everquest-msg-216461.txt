Probably because, like me, when the maps were introduced, sense heading 
was already at 200, so, like me, the other posters really only know that 
at 200 it's an arrow, and at lower levels it's a plus.  I only have one 
character, my main, that has sense heading high enough to matter, mostly 
because I just don't play my alts much at all, and, prior to the mapping, 
I found sense heading to be quite useless, as the /loc system would give 
me accurate information at any level of sense heading.
