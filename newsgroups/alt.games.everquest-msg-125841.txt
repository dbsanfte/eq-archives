You'll need to manually delete any 3dfx dll's in your Windows/System dir,
there will also likely be a 3dfx inf file in windows/inf but I don't think
this will be an issue, delete it anyway.
In your EQ dir there is a eqhardware.ini file this will have the driver info
for EQ I don't believe you need to modify this as EQ should just find the
next VGA driver available (your Nvidia chipset) but if, after deleting all
the 3dfx files, you still have problems you might want to try playing with
this (back it up first, of course)
I doubt you will need to, tho'
