Southern machine Democrats of the time had nothing beyond party label
in common with Democrats elsewhere in the country.  They were Democrats
precisely <because> Lincoln had been a Republican a century earlier,
and for no other reason.  Further, it has been argued quite convincingly
that the Republican support for the Civil Rights act was rooted in the
belief that they wouldn't actually have to vote for the bill, because
they believed that southern Democrats would kill it procedurally and
thus they could come away with good PR among black voters at zero cost.

And let's not forget that the civil rights movement gained currency and
visibility in national politics after Humphrey's speech to the (1947?)
Democratic convention (pretty sad that the major political factions
couldn't be bothered with it until after a white guy made a speech
in a prominent venue, it's not like the issue was new).  Civil rights
was not a Republican cause by any stretch of the imagination.
