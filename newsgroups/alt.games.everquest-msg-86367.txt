Long time ago, early in Velious, we were exploring Siren's Grotto. I was
/ooc'ing, 'DON'T DROWN! GET EB!'. Guess who was the first to drown...
Kept getting summoned back down every time I went for air heh.

Just last week, we were breaking the Mask room in Ssara. 'Watch out for
that wall, it's unclipped, and if you go in you'll fall into the
basement'. Next mob into camp pathed/pushed into that wall, 'You will
not evade me Demorgoth!', and I had time to type, 'Oh shit' as I got
that sinking feeling and the basement floor rushed up to meet me at 10k
speed...
