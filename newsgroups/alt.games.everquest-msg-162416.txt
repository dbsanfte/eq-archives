I still don't like Endless Quiver.  I don't think that having one
arrow last forever is a particularly good way to address the problem
of making Archery useful.  A 95%, or even 99%, chance of not losing
a particular arrow would be night-and-day different from 100%, and
would seem far more reasonable to me.  It's all moot anyway, they're
going to break something in Archery unrelated to the supposed issue
of Archery doing overpowering damage, that's the Everquest way of
"fixing" balance issues.  No doubt you remember back before Velious
when "Ranger" was the answer to the question: "What's the favorite
snack food of any Kunark boss mob?".  As I recall they first tried
raising Dodge/Parry caps rather than addressing the real problem of
[low HP + low AC + fast dual weapons + no hate mitigation] causing
unshakeable agro.
