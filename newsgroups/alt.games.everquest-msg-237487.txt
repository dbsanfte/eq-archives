SOE expects the servers to be down for the rest of the day,

Apparently a dragon was set loose in bazaar, bankers were duping plat, epics
were found on orcs, there were EXP sploits being used to go from level 1 to
65 in about 6 hours, and apparently giants in bot were dropping elemental
instead of ornate patterns. but.. none of these are the reasons for downtime
today..


APPARENTLY, a named mob took a swing at a ranger, and he DIDNT die. SOE is
investigating WTF happened and trying to fix it.



This is of course.. a joke
