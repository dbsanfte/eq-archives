Does anyone know exactly how to get these stupid things to spawn for the
Cann 2 shaman quest? I have checked all the web and they all say along the
aquaduct near the Seb zone, but I have been there for 4 days and not a
single one even shows up on tracking with bards, druids, and rangers....is
there a place holder for the Yun Shaman or what?

Any help appreciated,

Spuckler
