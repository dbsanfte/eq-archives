I do not totally agree with that, but it does ruin it, IMHO, for new
players.

They should have, as I have said before, imposed a level restriction on
PoK, say level 20, a nice present for reaching that far, beyond your last
name.  By that time, you should have traveled to a good portion of the
world on your own, explored, and had some fun doing it.  Making those runs
was not just about exploring and seeing wonderous things.  It taught you
that no matter how tough you think you are, there can always be something
bigger and badder waiting around the corner able to smash you into pixie
dust.  It taught you to observe the world around you and not run blindly
into it.  It taught, me at least, that some bad things come out only at
night (thank you werewolf, thank you Kithicor).  But most of all, it
taught me about the people of the game.  I met some wonderful people along
the way, willing to share the information, time and energy to help me
along my way.  Ive also met some assholes along the way that would simply
say "Pfft Noob" and offer no help at all.

Portals are cool, but they should not be available at level 1.
