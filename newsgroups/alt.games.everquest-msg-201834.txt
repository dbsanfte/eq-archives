All poisons and diseases have a certain number of counters
associated with them, and cure spells remove a number of
counters.  The higher the cure spell, the more counters
it removes.  You have to remove all the counters to remove
the spell.

IIRC, the creeping crud from the Plargs in PC is a 3 counter
disease, and the  cure disease that BL's get is a 1 counter
cure, so you have to cast cure disease 3 times to get rid
of creeping crud.

Now, they also added disease counters to many slow spells, so
that they can be targeted with a cure disease to be removed
instead of having to remove good buffs to get to it with
annull magic the way you used to.

At the same time, pet heals had a secondary effect of removing
disease counters added to them (the low level mage ones are 
8 or so).
