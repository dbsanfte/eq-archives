Yes, i was courteous at least! and sorry, english isnt my language, as u
probably noticed...

whatever, i just played a few days with Anarchy (a my brother' place) last
week and was addicted. He gave me his Everquest deluxe coz he didnt really
like it, so i just tried it here on my pc, and well, all i can say is i got
more fun with anarchy last week (everquest is not so nice and is little
empty with players compared to AO, thats what i thought first...) and then i
was little scared having to pay each month and having some trouble to
unsuscribe quickly...

but thank u for giving me answers, and now i want to try it more coz u guys
look really addicted! i promise i will practice at least one month (and
reach that level 3) ! see u then, and maybe i wil beg to subscribe more!
