Lesson learned painful as it may be but, I will also give you a tip. Use a
high level character to get someone to hold items or Find a city with a
community Oven, Kelm, Potters Wheel, ect. with the exception of Thurgadin
They are always being used. Have both characters camped at the oven. Place
Items in oven (hold Giant size but no containers) they are out of sight and
they will not despwan.
