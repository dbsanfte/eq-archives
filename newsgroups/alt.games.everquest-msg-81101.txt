Well, you know wrong, it is not a lag meter as such.  The numbers are, from
left to right, Ping time, Percent packet loss Incoming, Percent packet loss
Outgoing, Message size.  The incoming and outgoing may be reversed.  Ping
time is a measurement of how long it takes data to travel between your
computer and Verant's server.  Percent packet loss is the percentage of
packets lost going in each direction, and the Message size is a measurement
of how much data is in each packet.
