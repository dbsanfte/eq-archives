Just use "/pet report health" instead. They nerfed the other order for some stupid
reason.

All mobs over level 35 have a 90% chance to remeber you when you
stand back up after a FD. They have a 90% chance to totally forget you
if they reach their static spawn point. If they are a wandering mob with
no set spawn point then you just have to get out of their range or /quit
to make them forget you.
