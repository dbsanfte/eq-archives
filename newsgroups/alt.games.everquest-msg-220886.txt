I was talking about how mob riposte reduces the damage output of
people hitting from the front.

You bring up a good point, though, the one thing that the person
tanking gets that everyone else doesn't get is the opportunity to
riposte.  But Knights, who can weild big slow two handers without
sacrificing large amounts of their hate generation (still some,
of course, but melee isn't 90% of their hate like a warrior's)
benefit more from this than do warriors.   I don't think you can
tie riposte to a timer not dependant on mob attack frequency,
that doesn't make any sense.  But you -could- tie the chance of a
riposte to your weapon speed (so one handed weapons would riposte
more often, be they dual weilded or weapon and shield) and
further allow a dual weild check on all successful ripostes so
that two weapon riposting would do damage proportional to what
your two weapons do normally compared to a two hander.  Get the
chance adjustment right and it shouldn't matter what you riposte
with, your riposte damage over time should be consistant.  As a
bonus, someone using a fast weapon will now take -less- damage
due to higher riposte rate; that makes more sense, IRL I have  a
much better chance of blocking hits with a rapier and main gauche
than with a claymore.

I don't mind that groups don't want multiple tanks, this makes
sense to me.  There are only 6 slots available.  Healer, Tank,
Mezzer, Slower, 2 DPS, thats sensible group construction. 
Throwing in a secondary healer only makes sense if that healer is
also slower or DPS (in other words, two clerics makes little
sense).  Throwing in a secondary mezzer makes little sense unless
that mezzer is really there as DPS or the crowds are
extraordinarily large (cough*PBAE*cough).  Throwing in a
secondary slower makes little sense unless that slower is really
there as mezzer... only "DPS" really stacks.  Since half the
classes in the game are DPS, while there are only three tanks,
three healers, three mezzers, and two slowers, its not poor game
design to see things split up that way, or even to often see two
of the above jobs on one character so you can add a third DPS.

Since normally the model used is to engage only one mob at a
time, and keep its focus on one target, more than one "person who
can take all the hits" isn't any more useful than the more than
one mezzer model.

See above, I think "one tank per group" is about right.  Where
this sucks is for raids, of course, but there you do want backup
tanks to take over in case of deaths, or to off tank unmezables
and so forth.  And you don't have real need for multiple mezers
and multiple slowers in most raids either; only the Healer job
seems to scale up with the size of the raid.

Oh, and I've had a hard time forming LDoN groups recently (in the
35 to 45 range) because we can't find healers and we can't find
plate tanks.  Just one would do.  But mostly you find DPS classes
along with some enchanters and bards (those are also rarer... its
surprising how often you can find 6 DPS classes and none of the
specialists).  

Part of this, I think, is that plate classes are so highly
dependant on gear and that raids are so tuned around the plate
tank that anyone making a tin can now is very unlikely to ever
get to actually be MT for high level raids, any raid that has
access to someone who's been 65 for a year and has therefore much
better gear isn't going to let your Johnny-come-lately who just
made 65 be MT instead, not when it matters.  Since thats the only
thing they are really good at, making a character that won't be
allowed to do it doesn't make much sense, instead make a DPS
class, those are always needed and always allowed to contribute
as fully as they can!
