Go bizbee!!  I'm with ya there...

It's just mind-blowing to consider the waste of life we
experienced today all so some crazed cowardly maniac can
"fullfill his vision."

My (non politically correct) viewpoint is that we should
take an "eye for an eye" approach to this shit.  Maybe if
word gets out that we will kill and mame an equal amount
for EVERY terrorist activity, the people who live around
these terrorists will get scared for their own lives and
turn the fuckers in (or get them to stop somehow).

You know, it's fine if people don't like the US.  I don't
generally think much of places that throw rocks at each
other for a living.  However, I also do not go bomb and
kill their people for no reason at all and I would like
the same "respect" in return.

Those people are nothing but uncivilized savages.

Mike
