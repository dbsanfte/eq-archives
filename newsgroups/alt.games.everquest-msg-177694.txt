Others have explained this pretty well, so I'll just add a point from the
taunt debate...

DA/DB temporarily drop almost all aggro; the cleric will only be beaten on
if they are the only person on the hate list (which should only be true if
it's an add, and is quickly remedied.) So a single successful taunt (which
pulls the taunter to the top of the hate list) will make the cleric safe.
The reason for letting it run the full 18 seconds is to improve the chances
of a successful taunt.

The main risk is that, speaking for myself, I only use DA/DB in an emergency
(i.e. my HP are plummeting) so there's a serious risk of low-HP aggro when
it drops. Which is a good reason to make sure you've backed off a fair
ways -
if nothing else it gives you a chance to heal when it drops and lose that
low-HP aggro. DB has an advantage in that sense in that it includes a
healing component, but it takes longer to cast and so is used less.

True, you should pause slightly before backing off, but all it takes is for
one person to hit it before backing off becomes a good idea.
