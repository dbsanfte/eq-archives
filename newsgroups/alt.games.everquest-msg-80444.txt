    I had this problem on a old system. For some reason EQ doesn't
automagically detect the card as your default 3-d card.

    Try running the tutorial, it will ask you to pick your 3d accelerator.
After I picked the Monster 2 and started the tutorial everything was fine.
Exited and went to regular EQ and had no problems.

    Hope that helps...
