Not in the least.

I was a superlative "sponge" in this situation.  My "tanking" was so so,
though, because my DPS frankly is on the low end of things.

When I partner up with people, the speed at which the mobs die goes up
markedly.  I can kill those same mobs myself by using DOTs as DPS production,
given KEI, but thats not a fast way to kill mobs.   The ranger and monk in this
case were definately better than more shaman; those shaman, like me, could
contribute to killing really hard mobs, but easy mobs would see very little
boost from another shaman.  Furthermore, you only really need one damage
absorber.

What I was arguably replacing was a warrior, or perhaps a paladin or
shadowknight.  I wasn't doing as much damage as those classes might have, but I
was soaking up what the mobs could dish out as well as any of them (save those
as twinked out as I am) could.

This too, I suspect, will change as I level up; they will get more and more HP
and AC, they will get more and more damage avoidance skills, while my twinked
status will gradually slide into "standard level" goods.  I'm wearing level 40
gear, more or less, fabulous at level 20 but I'll need to upgrade even to stay
even by my 50s.
