ok, as a correction, i killed only giants and basaliks, because i too was
under the assumption basaliks were the only place holders.
as far as i can tell, there is no minimum number for hte HGs.  i can track
across just about the entire zone, and there have been many times where
there isnt a single giant on track.
i'd agree about the max though, i think theres 7 spawn points.
