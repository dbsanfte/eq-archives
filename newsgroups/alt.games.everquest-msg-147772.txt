All I can say is you found the wrong people.  The rogues in The Appointed
never have a problem finding a group.  They are actually quite desirable to
have along, they are great damage dealers.  I have been grouping quite
regularly with on since she started her rogue.  She is now level 54.  I did
some PLing on her until she caught up, along with others helping as well.
