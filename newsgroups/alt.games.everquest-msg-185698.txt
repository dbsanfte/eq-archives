** Pathing Changes **

Today we have introduced the first stage of an ongoing project to upgrade
the pathing system for EverQuest.

Of course this means we would like you to keep your eyes open for NPCs doing
bad things.  NPCs will (should) move a bit differently, that is to be
expected.  If, for example, you are used to a specific NPC taking a
round-about route to get from one place to another and he now takes a more
direct route - that's a good thing.

Bad things would be:

- An NPC that wants to get to you but can't
- Pets that can't follow you through a teleporter
- Any NPC that takes a much longer path than it should to get to a player
(like going away from the target for a bit then heading back)
- Any time an NPC doubles back, walking past his destination and then going
directly back to it
- Any significant 'warping' by NPCs
- Any NPCs that defy gravity by walking a few feet above the ground

And any other really odd behavior by NPCs when moving.

We are aware of current issues with NPCs fleeing (either from Fear or trying
to escape death).  For now, there is no need to report problems with NPCs
fleeing in odd ways.  We're working on that one now.

It is VERY important that you note the location of the odd behavior, the
name of the NPC, what it was doing (just patrolling around or chasing
someone it was mad at) and the details of the oddity in your bug reports.


Thank you for helping us with this.
