Does anyone know what I am missing? I have created a character in Paineel
and am trying to use the lift up to the newbie area. I have tried
everything, it worked once, probably by accident and it got me up to the
cliff top then I couldnt get it to work to go back down again. I have the
key on my curser but left or right click does nothing. Another newbie was
also having the same trouble although he was able to got up in the lift but
not down.
Come on guys, what am I missing? Please put me out of my misery.

Ian
