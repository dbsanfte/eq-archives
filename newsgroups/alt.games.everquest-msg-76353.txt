I've never been assigned a pally to keep me alive...probably 'cause there's
like 3 pallies on my server (Zeb)...at least, it feels like it.

It's been my experience that no one keeps me alive like a druid.  Too many
high level clerics get into this habit of thinking that no one needs a heal
below 50% and there's no rush until 30%.  At level 55 with all possible HP
buffs (well, shield over shaman tuna spells) I have 2300hp and 600AC.  If I
get to 50% health and I don't see the cleric already casting, I'm dead.  The
druids I play with know that if I'm being hit and I'm at 80%, they'd better
start casting.

Now, I'll be the first to say that there's plenty of clerics that know how
to keep me alive...it's in NO WAY a cleric slam.  But hell, if a tank is at
20% health when a critter decides to start swinging on ME, the cleric is
probably only 3 or 4 seconds into a 10-second Complete Heal of the
tank...and I can't last the minimum 10 seconds (6 to complete the CH + 4 to
cast Superior Healing on me) the cleric needs to keep me alive.  I love
druids who heal. :)
