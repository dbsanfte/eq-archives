I have noticed a huge difference in how fast my druid learned tradeskills
(tailoring, to be exact) when she was low level and short on wis, versus how fast
she skills up now with 198 wis. But no need to start over, just buy or loot some int
gear that is bard usable, and wear it when you practice tradeskills.  And don't
sweat it too much at 15; you have lots of time left for improving trades. Tailoring
in particular is easier to raise once you can track.
