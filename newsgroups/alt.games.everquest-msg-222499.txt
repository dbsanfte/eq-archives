Anyone else have this problem?  I have:
Deleted all of sol*.* files and repatched
Done a complete file check
Deleted character files

Doing all these allowed me to finally zone into solc with my
accounts... the next night I couldnt zone in again.  Whats more, at
first 2 of my 4 accounts COULD zone in on the same cpu and 2 others
couldn't...all using the same everquest directory.  Doesnt' seem like
a file problem to me since some could and some couldn't enter.  This
is driving me nuts...SOE has been no help.

My chars just zone into SolA now instead ;(
