DirectX  makes it possible for game designers to write games without
having to worry about all of the different types of hardware out
there. For instance EQ may send the command "play battle music". The
DirectX driver for your soundcard then executes the command and the
music plays. EQ doesn't know or care what kind of soundcard you may
have. As long as you have the correct DirectX driver installed
everything should work fine. Of course things don't always work as
planned. heheh

As new features are built into the hardware (like bump mapping and
pixel shaders on video cards) newer version of DirectX are required to
take advantage of them. The latest version is 9 as you noted above. 

Generally it is safe to install the latest version once it has been
out a couple of months.....It never hurts to troll the tech boards
after the release of a new DX version to see if peoples systems are
getting screwed up :-). Usually the latest version of DX speeds up
games (even those written for older versions). 

I have been running DX9 since the second leaked beta release with no
problems. I personally feel that it is as safe as it can be.
