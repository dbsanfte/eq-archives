Have you tried:
South Karana (and the other Karanas)
Everfrost
Lake of Ill Omen (very busy on some servers)
Unrest
Overthere (might be a little high yet)
Gorge/Beholder/Runnyeye (my personal favorite)

For most of these you'd have to get past guards on the way.  In 
Overthere the guards are evil aligned so the good guys have to watch 
out.  That makes for an interesting change if you're used to goodie 
guards.

Some of the Luclin zones might be fun too, maybe Netherbian Lair, though 
I haven't been there.
