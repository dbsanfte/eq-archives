>tailoring skins now stack. HQ, MQ, LQ and ruined

FYI Greg if you are using skins other than zombie skins for making
vials you are doing too much.  Zombie skins are 3plat a stack off
players in unrest =)

Plus, unless you are getting pottery up for shawl quests, you dont
even need to MAKE vials, you can buy em from every rogue poison vendor
for dirt cheap.
