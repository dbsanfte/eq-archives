The following is from Test (last night) and so cannot be guaranteed to
be accurate on regular servers, but in the PoK library:

I did not see the Enchant Xx spells on any of the "Illusionist" vendors.

Illusion: Scaled Wolf was there, or, hrmm, at any rate Illusion: Xx Wolf
was there, guess I wouldn't bet my life on "Xx" having been "Scaled".

None of the Enchanter pet spells was there.

Come to think of it, there wasn't actually a very good selection of
Enchanter spells available there.

Of the five "Illisionist" vendors, two had the exact same set of spells
(presumably one of them was supposed to have different stuff).

Most of the spells there were relatively high level, costing 18pp or
more apiece.  There were a few lower level spells tho, one vendor had
a pretty complete looking set of the Illusion: Xx series.
