I agree with the nickname bit, and personally don't care for any drug
references. As for abbreviations, it's merely a by-product of the times - the
majority is carry over from IM/internet speak. I work for a major internet
concern and we abbreviate all the time in IMs (lol, np, pls, ty, etc) and on EQ
with it's somewhat clunky interface, in the heat of battle and trying to do 3
or 4 things at once, I'll abbreviate as much as necessary as long as it still
gets the point across. I would definitely not do this on one of the strictly rp
servers of course, but that's a major reason why I'm not on one.

As far as some players just butchering the English language, that's another
thing - some of it is a carry over from the younger set and hip-hop/gangsta
mutilation of English and grammar. It's an unfortunate thing that our culture
is losing a lot of the grace that makes up 'proper language' and I assume we'll
see more and more of it in the future, and in EQ as well (oops, sorry for that
abbreviation!) 

Lastly, some of the bad grammar and spelling is just from illiteracy, I'm
afraid. Perhaps EQ could include spell/grammar checker modules or switches to
assist in these areas?

Just my 2 cents,
Serrad
