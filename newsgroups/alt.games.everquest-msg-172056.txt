"Then why don't you just say "wizard"? I don't call my skillet a
"skillie" or my toaster a "toastie". As I said, it makes sense to me
that people shorten some names, or even use a different term that
offers some benefit as in the "tank" example."


People in Australia speak like that.
Swimmies-Swimsuit
Sunnies-Sunglasses

Why? Heck if I know. But maybe an "Aussie" decided to call a "Wizard" a
"Wizzie" one day and it just stuck. Although it sounds more like a restroom
to me.
