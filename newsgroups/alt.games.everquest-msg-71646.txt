Most likely a Winmodem problem, as the others have said.  Here's an easy way
to tell - if it's a PCI modem, it's a winmodem.  A winmodem is a modem that
doesn't have a processing chip on it; it relies on software to do its
computing.  Get an ISA or external modem, and the world will be a better
place.
