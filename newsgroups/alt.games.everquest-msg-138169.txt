Ewww - 16bit colours. I thought they had released a monster graphics
glitched patch when the new UI came in. These horrible lines accross
everything and jagged edges everywhere let alone a "washed out" look. Then I
found the options area and dicovered it had defaulted back to 16 bit colour.
Phwew!

*happily back in the land of 32 bit colour*
