OK, we were both sitting Medding, If you want something from me while
you and I are medding then spell it out,  If you are in heated combat,
HL or HE  or H  will get you a heal.  

What got me worked up was not the pls it was that they followed it up
with an argument of my choice to roleplay why my halfling druid wasn't
healing s/h/it's Darkelf Shadowknight.  and how please, or pls or plz
compells me to do what is asked.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
