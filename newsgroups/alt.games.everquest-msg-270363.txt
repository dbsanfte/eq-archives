The 'new' 'free subscription' deal doesn't require you to enter any 
credit card information in order to start playing.

If you've been prompted for CC info, its because you downloaded the 
wrong version, with expansions, with a free 14 day trial -- and not the 
'AO classic' without expansions, with the free subscription.

At any rate, the software shouldn't ask you for your CC, and if you 
don't enter any CC in, you can rest assured you can't be billed for it.
