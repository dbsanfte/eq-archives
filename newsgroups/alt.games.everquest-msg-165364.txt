Oh, god yes I agree. The "flow chart" or script or whatever the
particular company calls it doesn't cover enough "angles" of the
problem to help. Even those who are familiar enough with the product
to cover where the script falls short tend to be discouraged or even
outright disciplined for breaking the script, even if doing so solved
the problem completely and quickly.

Of course, part of that is due to liability paranoia....
