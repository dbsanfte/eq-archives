Now you put it that way $26 shipping seems quite cheap - not. Be 
realistic. UPS can provide these chap carriage because they know full 
well at the other end they are sticking an extra $16 onto the charge. 
This is an addition to the tax.

I have repeatedly said, till I am blue in the face I DO NOT HAVE A 
PROBLEM WITH BEING TAXED.

I do have a problem that the carrier adds on a cost that is more than 
the cost of sending the item across the atlantic and more than the cost 
of the tax itself.

You go with the flow on this, I just want known costs like admin charges 
clearly stated upfront, doesn't seem much to ask. In fact UPS culd 
include this cost in there delivery charge. Then again noone would have 
brought the item. Now that is my problem. I've been legally conned!
