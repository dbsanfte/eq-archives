In case you hadn't noticed, the traditional 3 year upgrade cycle of
PCs has slowed down along with the economy.  What makes you think
original EverQuest wouldn't continue to have a strong subscriber
base?  I think a lot of people with older PCs would continue to play
original EverQuest, even if EverQuest 2 were available.

One of the reasons I left EverQuest was the ever expanding hardware
requirements.  (No, Kaev, I'm not bitter about it.  They had to make
those enhancement to stay competitive with the likes of Asheron's
Call 1 and 2, Dark Ages of Camelot, etc.)

However, with EverQuest 2 around the corner, they could almost freeze
work on original EverQuest, keeping R&D costs low, while retaining the
subscriber base using hardware that doesn't play EQ 2 effectively.
