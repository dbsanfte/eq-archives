That's where the throw-down without the serial number comes in handy.

No, I guess I didn't make myself clear. One between the eyes. ;)

I always have a fear of shooting my nuts off doing that. And I'd feel

Depends on where you live. I heard they give you a medal in Texas.

My kinda guy!! Maybe we can get together and start our own version of 
the NRA!!! And most people that would do that are VERY familiar with 
that needle in their arm. How do you think they get the courage to do 
that sort of thing.

Probably not as many as you'd think. My GUESS is less than 5 across the 
country. Probabably less than that. Oh by the way, I was KIDDING.  
Kidding aside, while I wouldn't hesitate to draw down on someone who 
crosses my threshold without my say so, I'd probably hesitate on pulling 
the trigger. I'm the type that believes that a gun is a tool. It's the 
slavering moron wielding it that is the wildcard. But holding a loaded 
weapon on someone who is where they shouldn't be will make them think a 
little before running.
