Sorry for this...  LOL

Ok, so now we're ready to get that second account.  Got the Trilogy and
Luclin for xmas... hehe  Now, will Verant transfer my character to the
second account if that second account has a different owner name?

Basically, the main account is in one name, we want the second account in my
name and we want Cory to transfer with everything.  Same server and etc of
course...

Any advice?  Thanks in advance!
