MORE ON NPC CASTERS, JUNE 7, 2002
Source: Developers Corner.

Firstly, some NPC casters are casting spells above their levels (blue to 60
casters casting level 60 spells for example). Please look into this.
Secondly, please recall that most damaging spells are balanced with a player
harming an NPC with NPC level hps in mind. An NPC casting these spells on a
player is doing damage that is a much larger percentage of the target's hps than
when a player is casting on an NPC. There is a reason that spells are "nerfed"
in pvp combat. Please consider reducing the damage that NPC spells do to players
in a manner similar to the way they are balanced in pvp.

Third, the price that players pay for being able to cast spells is in hitpoints,
armor class, lack of melee ability, and a limited mana pool. While npc casters
have a somewhat limited manapool, most don't seem to have any of the other
disadvantages that pcs pay to be casters, thus making them essentially warriors
who cast. I would ask that you consider scaling down the hitpoints or melee
ability of casting mobs, as an npc who can cast for 1200dmg and hits for 250
just like the non-casting warrior npcs in the same dungeon, is over-powered.

Actually, that�s a �sort-of-a-bug� thing� Because NPCs were so stupid about
casting spells before, some of them were given improved spell casting abilities
to make them relatively better casters. Some of those casters might be too good
now, and the team will be looking at those on a case-by-case basis.

Keep in mind, though, that NPCs can be weak or strong for their �level�, and
special NPCs can certainly be tougher or weaker than their /con might indicate.
Having some of them cast higher level spells is just another tool, just like
giving them procs or breath weapons or other innate abilities.

We�re not forgetting any of those things: we know NPCs have relatively more hit
points than PCs, we know they do more damage� we know that stuff.

You have to keep in mind that these NPCs, though smarter, still don�t have the
advantages of being played by human beings. The players get to pick the odds for
the most part, they get to pick the timing of the fight and they get to choose
from a wide arsenal of classes, spells, items, abilities etc. And a human can
put all that stuff together in ways that even our AI code can�t (though I�d love
to see NPCs splitting PC spawns.).

That�s the price that NPCs pay, and it�s a pretty big one.

But we�re keeping our eyes on it, playing against these nifty NPCs ourselves and
all that. We�ll make further changes as needed.
