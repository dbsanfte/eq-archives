Hrmph.  Well, they pretty much only edited out the letter "u" in "I want to
fuck you like an animal" from the radio version of Nine Inch Nails' Closer.
Can't be *that* prudish, don't know what the hell happened to Atomic
Kittens... that's nothing anyone would even blink at here.

(I'm not denying that we have a depressingly large right-wing
ultra-conservative population here, but it's not *that* bad, yeesh.)
