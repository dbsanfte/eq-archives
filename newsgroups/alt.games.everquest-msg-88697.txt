Hello, this is my first time posting to this newsgroup and I was wondering if
anyone might be able to give me some advice or an answer to my problem.
Whenever I die, and return to loot my corpse, it will take me about five
attempts to get everything. Reason for this is, is that looting my body (and
only mine) causes me to lag out and disconnect allowing me to get only a few
items at a time. Has anyone else encountered this problem and found a way
around it? Its very frustrating when it takes you a half hour to get playing
again. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.
