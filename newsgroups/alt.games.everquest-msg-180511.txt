I was interested in all sorts, so thanks.

I missed the AC buffs because while I've tried casting Symbol and the
Heroism/Fortitude line (and failed) with Aego, I'd never tried it with
the AC line since I use them so rarely. :-)

Hmmm... KEIed cleric PLing tactics.

0. Buff up the person being PLed
1. Nuke MOB down to 10% (or so)
2. root it
3. DS it
4. Atone it (a few times)
5. Let it beat on somebody until it dies. (Person needs to hit it once,
though.)

Ruinously expensive on mana (depending on the nuke used), but should work
with almost any MOB.

Speculating here - the only PLing I've actually done is healing and
buffing...
