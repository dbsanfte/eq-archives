What's embarrassing is your continual opinions that don't quite mess with 
reality. My "pal" posted an apology? haaaaaaaaaaaaaa... wow... you have 
quite a twisted perception. His level of frustration with the necro we 
grouped with is much higher than my own. You see, he has seen how well our 
group can work together, with players who THINK as a group, while in a 
group. Those who like to try and solo in an Ldon are useless. Our system 
works well, until ONE selfish group member comes in and does not know how to 
work well with others. It is a recipe for disaster.

However, nothing I say will convince you of anything. I say up, you say 
down. Yet, when others you know come say the same things as I do you agree 
with them? There is no working with you while that huge chip is upon your 
shoulder. And though you are quite good at being rude, it is not an 
attribute I'd boast about. You should be ashamed of the welcome you give new 
members. It is quite.... embarrasing...
