I'd say that things are fine up to the mid 50s. Warrior hitpoints
still make a difference and agro lock isn't as important.

I can't help but think that it's gonna end up with a knight nerf. I
see the same problem that I do with complete heal, SOE has painted
themselves into a corner since raid mobs are balanced against warriors
tanking so any upgrade to warriors is gonna trivialize raid targets
which is something they seem loathe to do. If sony hadn't been so
stupid (or lazy) over the last year they could've avoided a lot of
this. How hard would it have been to add warrior only items with more
hitpoints (and no mana) to keep the hitpoint difference versus knights
at a reasonable level. Even LDoN only has generic plate armor and they
surely knew this problem existed before LDoN came out. 

Since I don't like to see nerfs, here's my solution to warrior
problems. Up warrior DPS by around 10% and increase their damage
mitigation by 20%. Also, make warriors immune to the damage mitigation
spells that enchanters and clerics got with LDoN. It wouldn't change
things one bit on a raid since I assume enchanters will be chain
casting that 20% mitigation rune anyway but it would allow warriors to
tank much better in an exp situation.
