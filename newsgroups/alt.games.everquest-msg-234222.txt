This quest is okay, not that time consuming if the stuff is up.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1461

Specifically the bottom section where the reward is:

Result is Warhammer of Ethereal Energy 

The mobs for that can be killed pretty fast solo by a 55 druid, are
pretty much never dead, and can be ported fairly near to.

About the hardest part is tracking down the recuso smuggler dudes for
the first time, then killing them and waiting if they don't have the
hammer (the hammer is visible in their hand, if one of them have it)

I'm not sure if this thing sells for much anymore, though. But its
something fun to do kind of. When luclin was new I'd do that quest, go
and sell the Warhammer, then immediately do it again and repeat.

Rallic pack usually sells pretty fast, still.

As a druid you can get there pretty fast too, ignore someone who is
loitering around the entrance you ran by, track and run and kill the
grimling runner before anyone else gets to it if you can ;)
I've done that before then on my way back out with the pack, from
katta, passed the person again and they say "grimling runner is
camped" and I go "OH, OKAY"  oops... ;)  They should have spoke sooner
I guess!
