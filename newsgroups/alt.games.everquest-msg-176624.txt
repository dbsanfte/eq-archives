What scare is that? I have never got any error messages, and the default 
behaviour of leaving the messages in the server for one week before 
deleting has allowed me to retrieve mail I was too hasty to delete, on 
occasion. 

If I had to give up the Mac, I think Mail is one of the applications I 
would miss the most, because of the fantastic Spam filter. I get easily 
a hundred pieces of Spam a day, and Mail catches all but a handful, and 
I haven't had a false positive in months.
