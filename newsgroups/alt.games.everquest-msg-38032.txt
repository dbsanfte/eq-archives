No, because the fact that better loot dropped rarely from things like
half giants in mtn rathe would mean you WOULD go there instead of Lake

outdoor zones in velious, or wherever. 

Maybe a lot of people would initially jump in Lake of ill omen but but
really there are only a few higher mobs there and people are not going
to wait in like for them, they'd go to a less crowded zone.

Its not going to happen though anyway ;) If you recognize the fact
that if I wish hard with a magic fairy want that it might, you can in
turn say "okay add to that the fact that all zones would be equally
good for xp too."  Two impossible things with one wave of the fairy
wand!
