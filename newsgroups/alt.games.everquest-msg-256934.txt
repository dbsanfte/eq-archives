I am not fond of ducking out of a CH at all...I figure that I may 
have a bit of lag, and not want to risk it.

On other healings, one raidmaster I have raided with a few times 
had the clerics have a second and 3d person /target <name> 
hotkeyed, and after the CH cooked off, hit the hotkeys and if 
they need topping off, to hit them with a fast lesser heal, so 
people werent having to call out heals, or duplicating lesser 
heals. He also had one or 2 healers that were responsible for 
specific non-tanks, like the main shammy, main and backup CC 
casters, which worked fairly well.

I do know that in at least one fairly disorganized raid I kept my 
game husbands shammy alive through a few bad pulls as I was a 
backup healer so I kept him on hotkey and popped a fast heal on 
him several times when his assigned healer was off in lala land 
admiring her newly won leg armor.....and my regular healing 
assignments never even noticed and none of them died...yet 
several of *her* assigned people died....<major grumping here!. 
Stop mucking about and keep your group alive, don't be sending 
tells to everybody you know about your new armor!>

I find I love grouping with people I am familiar with, because 
you get to know all the timing on heals so there are fewer messups...
