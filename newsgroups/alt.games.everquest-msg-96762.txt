Jeez. I'll never understand why druids have such a bad reputation when
there are such well-informed, literate, and game-savvy druids as
yourself out there.>>

Thank you.

 Next time I'll be sure to expand it to three overlong paragraphs all to say
the same thing.

I will also do my best to include some asinine, cutting one liner at the end to
demonstrate my intellectual superiority  and/or emotional maturity.

Take a vacation. It's a game. Luclin is too laggy for my and my puter's likes (
yes I have a decent machine and graphics card with 512MEGS or RAM) and a Druid
is less effective there than elsewhere.
