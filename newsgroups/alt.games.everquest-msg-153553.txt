Yes, and I'm just as entitled to tell you that your concerns are
nothing more than a shitload of pathetic mewling from a spoiled little
child.

Any particular incident you're referring to or can you just not handle
my position that "you get what you pay for" when it comes to BNet?

How nice. The fact that I happen to think there's absolutely nothing
wrong with these changes (and, in fact, most of them are GOOD
changes), which goes against your opinion, I'm a sheep and I "get a
hardon" agreeing with it? And you're the one protesting my criticism
of your expressing your opinion when you come down even harder on
mine? Hypocrite.
