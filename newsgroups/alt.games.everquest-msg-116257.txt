Right, just a quick one (British readers may insert the obligatory 'oo-err
missus' here).

If you were a level 10 dark elf rogue, just setting out to start improving
that lovely ol' backstab skill - and you were in the Qeynos Hills/West
Karana area - what weapon would you be looking for?

I'm currently using a rapier, having moved up from a giant snake's fang, but
can anyone suggest where I might be able to pick up an even snazzier
piercing weapon and how much it might cost?  I know this is the sort of
thing that I should discover for myself through exploration and experiment,
and I have tried.  It's just that the only "better" weapons I can find seem
to be slashing or blunt and cost both arms, a leg and one ear.

Any suggestions appreciated.
