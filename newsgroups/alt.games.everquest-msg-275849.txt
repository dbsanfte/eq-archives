Group,

Just a note to say thanks for the information on fixing my stuck
trader in the bazaar. Once I reloaded the files I was fine.

On another note, the GM I petitioned got my corpse which had been
teleported into Infected Paw back for me with all my lost XP restored!
I had resolved to wait until it appeared in Shadowrest to get it
back...  A hats off to SOE support for a change.

Julie
