Over the past few days I've noticed that Banneth, my Vah Shir bard on
Bristlebane, is now barely able to see in the dark.  It was my
understanding that Vah Shir have infravision, so it seems odd that
I've noticed a change.  Granted, I've swapped a fair amount of gear
out recently, and I may have removed something that gave him improved
night vision.

I've tried singing the level 24 song that gives ultravision, and it
gives a dramatic improvement, even if everything takes on an awful
blue tinge - is ultravision that much better than infravision?  What's
the difference?

So has anyone else noticed their vision changing, or is it just me?
It could be creeping dementia, as I rapidly approach my 40th
birthday...
