Aside from the fact that you need loads of friends to help out on the
various raids (Mage Epic is one of the hardest in the game, only beaten by
the warrior epic afaik)?

Well, there are the words of power or something like that in Najena. Pick
these up when you're hunting your focus items (also needed for epic). I only
got 2 during roughly 3 levels or so that I camped that place, but I think I
was just unlucky.

For the rest you can easy get the Power of Earth from Faery guards in Lower
Faydark and a bit harder is the Power of the Wind in Mistmoore (bring
friends and at least 1 chanter).

These are the more easy parts, doable level 20-40 or so. The rest gets
harder and harder and you have to wait till lvl 46 anyway because of plane
items.

You can start the Epic by talking to Rykos (sp?) in Lake Rathe and get his
coin to the guy in WC, but this part is not necessary to complete the quest
(just roleplay-wise nice to do and you get some exp as well).
