I really can't complain about that raid, Celaeno.  When we had Biano
summon corpses to Ogre island for us, I had sufficient high-level help
around to single-pull and kill Coercer Q`quiol for the Kedge robe
she'd spawned wearing an hour later.  I had to stay up for a few hours
extra, but after 11 Phinny raids and 4 Kedge-less Coercers, I was
glad to have folks around not doing anything else :-).

Of course, I ALSO can't complain about that raid because it showed
what poor aggro management can do.  Triggered Faydedar is a
LONG corpse run when he fails to despawn or path to the Iksar
Butt-stomper...
