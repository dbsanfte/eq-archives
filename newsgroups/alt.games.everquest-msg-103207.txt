Get out of LOIO now while you still have your sanity in place, I hate that
zone.  Good xp but it attracts too many idiots.

Stonebrunt is fun if you like to solo or you have a thing against gorillas
(i get some kind of guilty pleasure from killing them for some reason).
Check out details of wakizashi quest if you are gonna spend time there, may
as well do it while you are there.

Luclin.... you can try Paludal caverns tho most of the bandits will be going
green.  Marus Seru if you like outdoor zones, Netherbian Lair if you like
indoor zones or you are desperate for money.  Neth will get you to 30 quick
with the bonus for under 30 dungeons they have now.   The mobs in there give
me the willies tho, I don't stick around there long.

 Hunting in Marus seru...... Rockhoppers will help each other, no sense
going after them unless you are out of other mobs to kill; Lightcrawlers can
see you on the other side of the freaking zone, if you can see them even if
you can't see them, they WILL agro on you;  just once agro a zelniak and
train it to the guards and stick close enough to get the fight spam when
they finish it off, i say zelniak cuz I'm sure the guards will kill them,
other mobs....you may be on your own if you get in over your head.

Good luck
