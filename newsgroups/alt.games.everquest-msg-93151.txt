LOL, how cruel!  You would make a magnificent Dark Elf.

OT: I recently grouped with a DE cleric whose CHeal hotkey said
something close to:
"[Kaev], you have not yet sufferred enough... HEAL!"
I have noticed that every DE cleric I have ever met has been both
courteous and entertaining.  In fact, DE cleric and Gnome warrior are
the only race/class combos that I've never seen played by a jerk.
