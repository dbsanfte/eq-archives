I said I worked for Sony from the start you must have missed that one,
I also stated that I used to post as Greedo, in that same post.
You should really check , before you say anything.
And I'm not Bullshiting you that I work for Sony. Funny thing is no
one from Sony ( since they are so many that post here) have said I am
full of shit, only you paying customer have. 

So I guess I have yet to cut anything .....
