Then it sounds like you need to force the issue.  If you wish, you can
inform the people managing the rotation that since they aren't going to let
you in that you will treat the mobs as FCFS.  Or you can just assemble a
force and take one of them down.

One of two things will happen.  A place for you will magically appear on the
rotation, or the rotation system will collapse.

Personally, I'd just assemble a force and gank it.
