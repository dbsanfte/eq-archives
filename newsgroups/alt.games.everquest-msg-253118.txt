I have 2 newbie chars sitting on Stromm, a Cleric and a Paladin. The
Paladin has had one Giant Sylvan Bat Fur drop and the Cleric hasn't seen
a solitary one. I gave up after almost 50 kills over a month and a half.
I'd log in, play them for a couple of hours, kill everything around Orc
Hill then log to my mains on another server.

I've killed everything in the northern part of the zone and didn't see a
significant improvement in spawns of these critters. When these quests
first arrived, a year, maybe 2, ago last March(?), I did all the Assling
quests. I remember the frustration there regarding a few items and
everybody on the server seemed to be in Misty looking for the rare
drops. These bat furs are another matter though. I've seen one and often
heard people auctioning to pay insane sums for looting rights as they
are nodrop. Good luck my friend!
