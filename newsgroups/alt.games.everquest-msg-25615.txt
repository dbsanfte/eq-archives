Well, in his defense, the issue wasn't banking, it was getting to Faydwer,
without Kunark.  AFAIK there are only two ways to do that, teleport, boat.
Boat was not an option (without invis of some sort).  However, as you have
said, the price for the tp is whatever the porter is asking, if you don't
want to pay it, don't.  Is it possible to get to the boat, more or less
safely, using the tunnels?  For someone who is not KOS in the tunnels that
is of course.
