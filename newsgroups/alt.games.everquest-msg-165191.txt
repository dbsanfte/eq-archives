Getting bored of my usual haunts, and am thinking of taking Sekani (43
Iksar Monk) to the Jagged Pine Forest.  He is pretty decently
equipped. (no fungi, but does has SCHW and lots of Reinforced
Acryllia, with a Stave of Shielding and Gorgana Spiked Club)

Any guidance or links to a guide would be greatly appreciated.
