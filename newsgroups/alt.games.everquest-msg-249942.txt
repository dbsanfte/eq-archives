Execution is more expensive in the uninted states becuase we go to extreme
measures to assure no innocent men are executed. This costs us more money
than incarecerating them for life. Not all other countries use such extreme
measures though. The cost of an execution in china for instance is MUCH less
and far less than rthe cost of execution. Oddly enough executions in china
make money not lose it since they harvest organs. I certainly dont condone
such practices but your just wrong :p Incidently china comprises more than
half the worlds population in and of itself.
