He stated he has J-Boots.


I think you are wrong on a few facts.
They raised the max limit to 255 or 254.
You get 6 more mana for each point.
You can get a max of 10 int from AA exp

How much mana does fear cost? Feign death? Gate?

For a solo necro that is outside most of the time it is more important
to have the most mana he can get.  He has stated he has j-boots why
should he waist time getting run speed.  As much as people want to
claim run speed is important in dungeons is not.

If he has the time get more stamina.  The necro needs more HP so he
can burn more.
