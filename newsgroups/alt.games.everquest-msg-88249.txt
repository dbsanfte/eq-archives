I think I read this here one time; is it true that if your character
gets killed somewhere where a corpse retrieval would be risky, you can
/consent another character you have on the same server and have the
second character drag the corpse to somewhere safe?

(for example, you have a Dark Elf that got killed near the entrance to
Field of Bone by the Iksar guards and you have an Iksar character on
the same server, you could /consent your Iksar to drag your Dark Elf
corpse somewhere safe, then log off your Dark Elf, log on your Iksar
and have your Iksar drag it?)

Thanks in advance,
