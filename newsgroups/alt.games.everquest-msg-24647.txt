Recently, some L50 person started shouting that he had accidentally dropped
a bag of stuff he had been collecting for abotu a year.
Poor guy, up pop the flame wars. "You dumb-!@#$...", "Just how dumb do you
have to be...", "Sucks to be you d00d..."
He goes on shouting about how he really needs the stuff back as he can't
survive in his groups w/o it and really sounds pathetic.
People start taking sympathy on him and start shouting that whoever found
the bag should give it back. Then he starts getting pissed and starts
ragging on everyone and EQ in general and that he is tired of wasting his
time in it, yadda yadda yadda. Next day, I login and I see a MOTD saying to
be careful of your stuff as things that disappear because you drop them will
not be re-imbursable.

2 sides of this:
1) He's a L50, shouldn't he know better? Sure anyone can make a mistake, but
to put all your stuff in a bag and then drop it? There is a setting that
asks if you really want to do this. Did he have it off or did he just blow
thru it?

2) Should VI start tagging all equip in case this exact thing happens? I
mean we are all responsible for our own actions, but there are genuine
mistakes are there not? If tagging were to happen VI could then follow the
chain of evidence to whoever has it and make amends. In the case of someone
running off with them and then selling them, couldn't VI have a Guide just
make up the difference? It is all just virtual afterall.

I know of another online gaming service that tags all equipment to eliminate
duplicate items. They have a far smaller user base than EQ does. Couldn't VI
do the same thing? What about a restore from backup? We have all seen the
little "<Charname> saved" message, couldn't VI have restored from one of the
saved files for this guy?

VI is a pay-to-play service, shouldn't they provide services other than just
the servers and the environment? Shouldn't they do things like this for
their money?

I don't have a stance either way, just throwing that out for discussion.
What does everyone think?
