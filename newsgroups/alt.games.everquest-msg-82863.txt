Your opinion

Also your opinion. When I solo my wiz I kill 4 blue con mobs at once,
and never need a healer, and still have half a bar of mana after
killing 4 mobs solo. I'm still doing this at level 51.

That's because players share your mistaken assumption that the only
way to get exp is to bash mobs with a tank.

No, it's an opinion based on incomplete facts, that tries to pass
itself off as the "one and only" way to play EQ.

I've played EQ plenty, and what I described is the boring melee based
exp grind that you hold up as the ONLY way to play EQ. You express
this bogus attitude of the majority perfectly with your comment, "What
you have described above is exactly how the games is played from level
16-60". It's exactly the way that boring resistant to change chumps
play the game. A good AE group based around AE casters and AE
stunners, with 1 tank, will RAKE in exp way way way faster than your
dull plodding melee group. Outdoors, an AE group doesn't even need the
tank, or the stunners or healers for that matter.

No, wizards get effective AE starting at level 1. At later levels
their AE gets godly, but early on it can still be used.

Pillar of frost is godly. I do 755 dmg to 4 different mobs for 300
mana. That's over 3000 HP dmg from one 300 mana spell. In my orginal
post, I described using this one spell to do more damage than the rest
of my group combined, and I never pulled agro off the tank. By the
time the tank is finishing up the first mob, I've got the 3
non-engaged mobs down to like 10% life, and never get the agro.

Using point blank AE, the damage ratios get truly absurd. I've read of
some wizards doing 15K+ HP damage from ONE spell! Then you come along
and say wizards are not of value in a group? Can I have some of what
you are smoking?

Pure bullshit. In my example above, I was the only person in the group
casting AE. By using proper timing, and location I was able to nuke
away, and never draw agro. Why don't you try actually experimenting in
game before you post such wrong information. On the other hand, since
you appear to be an idiot, maybe you just better stick to the safe and
sane method of leveling. You'll probably cause less death among your
groupmates that way.

Duh? You just can't think of any other way to fight than mezzing, can
you? Too much to get your little pointy head around is it?

An AE group uses different strategy than YOUR exp grind group. An AE
group does not bother mezzing adds, the AE group kills them all at
once. AE mez may play a part in the AE group, but only if it's
carefully coordinated mezzing in between nukes. Usually a chanter will
just chain cast stuns.

Along with your other insights about fighting in EQ, this impression
is similarly fubar. I have:

51 wizard
46 shaman
45 rogue
45 SK

and numerous other twinks too low to mention. I've been playing EQ
since commercial release, mostly on pvp servers. I know all about your
single-pull strategy, I also know that in the right setting, with
clueful group members, an AE group will get 10 times the exp that the
melee based group will get in the same time.
