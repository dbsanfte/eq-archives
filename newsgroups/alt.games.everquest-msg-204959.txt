I bet this was during Luclin. Luclin sucked for clerics. It seemed like
every other class got enough abilities and spells to solo, even warriors
seemed to be able to solo effectively, or duo with a shaman or shaman
bot. Meanwhile the poor clerics were only wanted for raids unless you
had a pre-existing group of friends to group with. But, I found this all
changed when PoP came out. Suddenly grouping was back in and every group
want's a cleric when the mobs are hitting for the kind of damage PoP
mobs do. I got a little tired of my cleric during Luclin, though I did
have friends to group with when they were all on at the same time, but
I've found since PoP came out I'm having a much better time. Not only is
it easier to get a group, you have to work at playing, unlike most
pre-pop experience groups where you ground through the easiest blues you
could find for the most efficient experience. I had maybe 18 aa points
by the time PoP came out, now I can get 4aa in 4-6 hours depending on
how good the group is.

Doesn't sound like a guild worth staying in. I joined my guild because
it had real life friends in it and it was a raiding guild. It's quite
clearly stated on our guild's website that if you join the guild you're
expected to raid with the guild when it raids so I went in knowing what
to expect.

In a typical PoP group, I'll be healing, medding, stunning to help the
enchanter or freeze a mob for root parking, and if my mana can take it
I'll even be nuking a bit. If I ever get the L65 damage sheild I'll be
using that too, though it seems like a bit of a waste of mana on a
slowed mob. I still don't think we melee worth a damn, even with the
highest summoned hammer. Maybe I need to get a haste item. :)
