Pretty simple. There's a good tutorial system and lots of message boards to
help you out.

> Interface
Nothing spectacular, but functional. The new expansion (Trials of Atlantis)
lets you use a custom interface if you like.

> Casual Playability
Definitely. You'll still grind, but pickup groups are prett easy to come by.

> Solo Playability
A lot of this depends on the class you choose. Some definitely solo better
then others. I work the night shift, so I quite often have to go this route.

> Group Playability
No problems here. And the new expansion has a really nice 'looking for
group' search / flag function built into it.

> Questing/Quests Quality
Meh. Nothing that will make your jaw drop, but quests are there, and there
are some interesting stories.

> In-game events/story
Not so much. "We good, them bad."

> Crafting Usefulness/Fun
Good crafters can make some good cash. Most players will get a set of
player-made magical armor as their 'good stuff'. Crafting is still tedious
(to me) - buy material, click, repeat. Very useful skill to pick up though.

> Economy in the game
I have no idea, honestly.

> Beauty of gameworld
Always improving. The new expansion does a full upgrade of the engine. Very
nice stuff.

> Quality of Dungeons
Depends on teh dungeon. ;-) Overall, I enjoy the dungeons that are there.

> Lore - Depth of backstory and history, continuing story?
Lots of backstory pulled from myths, but no overarching 'continuing story'.

> Community - Good Fan sites/boards
Yep. I usually visit the boards at http://camelotvault.ign.com and
http://www.camelotherald.com is mythic's site - they do a really good job of
keeping people informed about what is going on with the game, esp. where
patches are concerned.

> Age of game
ummm...2001-ish?

>   Population of servers
Primetime - anywhere from 1000 - 2000+ depending on the server

>   Population of newbies
Not so huge, now.

> Server Stability
Fantastic. The come down for scheduled patches. I've never been on a server
that has crashed. I've heard of it happening, but have never eperienced it.

> Customer Service
I've never really had to use it, so I can't comment.

The Quest Journal is the big plus - it's nice to not have to keep a notebook
handy. And definitely bring friends - it's better with a group!

DAoC is, IMO a fun journey. Soloing all the time will probably drive you to
tears if you just camp and grind. If you're casual though, you should find
plenty to do.
