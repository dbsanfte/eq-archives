You got that in reverse, my cleric used it so that a 54 sk buddy could
wack the mob down to almost dead.. THEN my cleric atoned it (twice to
make sure) THEN killed it for all the xp ;)

Its kind of balanced because a cleric is not so great at doing this
all alone, on either end. The cleric would have to be with some other
class also helping to power level the person to make this work well.
Mainly my 39 dark elf cleric finds this spell a great escape,
especially in areas like jagged pine. Oh, one of those pesky wolves is
after me.. root, atone, atone, run.. the thing wanders off when root
breaks and I don't have to worry about any subsquent losses to jagged
pine residents (which I'm trying to raise.)

Its nice that it wipes you from the faction hit list also.. if it
works.
