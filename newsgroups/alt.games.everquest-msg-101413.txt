Better yet, hunt the west side of Frontier Mountains over by the 
Burning Woods zone. Plenty of giants there too, and they'll be
mostly blue cons at 43; over there you have craigs and braes
instead of the green hillocks and tumps in the fort.

If exp is a concern, that is...obviously you can make more 
plat per hour killing greens.
