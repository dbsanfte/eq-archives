Hey look.. Moe just jumped off a cliff... well...

"That's not how I would have done it!"

Its not how people who setup such groups do it... for the reasons
specified. If one bit of thought had been put into the name it would
never have been named alt.games.coh.

Yeah.. being like every other mmorpg newsgroup and having a games
newsgroup be completely self-explanatory was a little too much to ask.

Nah.. i was just pointing out the error.

Probably not... but I don't play City of Heroes.. yet. Why would I
setup a group for a game I'm not in yet? But it is perfectly valid to
point out someone's error.. especially when you might want to play the
game at a future date and thereupon participate in that newsgroup.
