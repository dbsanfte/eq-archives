 Actually, I tried this with a non-kos alt character. I hailed Rotgrime
then went behind the Marines and tried giving braids to the Captain.
Tried a couple times and I was still too far away and I was pretty close
to the marines. I don't have sneak though so I don't know if I could
have went further. Will try some more tests later.
