So sorry, a tad off target getting people mixed up, but the point
remains...

One can address a specific person without taking it to a private
forum. Are you being intentionally dense out of boredom or have you
suddenly lost all sense?

Yes, they are open forums. However, a conversation can be carried on
between two people in an open forum. One can post a message to address
one specific person in an open forum. The only reason to take it to
private is that you don't want it to be read by everyone. Posting it
publicly does NOT mean that you're addressing the group as a whole
rather than the person you're responding to.

Take this post. I'm addressing YOU. I'm talking to YOU. Taras. Others
are welcome to step into the conversation, but in this post I am not
talking to THEM, I am talking to YOU.
