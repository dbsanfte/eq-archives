" SOE EQ2 Auction Site Opens
  I received a phone call from SOE tonight to give me some pretty amazing -- 
and unsettling -- news. SOE's Station Exchange is now live. Station Exchange
you ask? Oh no, is that what I think it is? Yes, Sony is now going to start
allowing players to officially auction items and cash for real live money.
Initially, it will be limited to two new servers they are creating for
Everquest 2, with existing players being given the right to transfer to
those servers where they can buy and sell with officially sanctioned
impunity. However, this is just the experimental stage. It is clear from the
FAQ that if this proves to be financially successful, there is no reason not
to think that this experiment will eventually be expanded to all of EQ2 as
well as SOE's other games, which include Everquest, Star Wars Galaxies and
even possibly, given their large ownership share of Square-Enix, Final
Fantasy XI. IGE, meet SOE.
