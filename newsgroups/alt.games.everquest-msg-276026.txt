I like to check them out from time to time just to see how much damage I can
really do. I'm not into the really heavy analysis that some people do, it's
just something I like to take a look at for fun. (not to mention, that since
I don't understand half of what they do, I couldn't analyze them if I wanted
to)

The one I used for EQ would also log conversations, so if I wanted to find
someone I'd met but forgot their name I could go back and find it. I could
also look at the performance of a whole group and see who did the most
damage. I could also see how much damage my pet was doing.

You can also use them to find out how hard various MOBS hit (somtetimes in
battle you're just too busy to notice) and how many hitpoints they have.
