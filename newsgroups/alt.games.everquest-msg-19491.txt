Paying for the transfer doesn't bother me too much, but not being able to
transfer your items bites royally.  This isn't a huge problem if you're
moving a character to a different account on the same server as you can just
pass your non-no drop gear to youy new account, but what about if you have
rare hard to find no drop items?  I recently twinked my level 21 Cleric with
an Aegis of life and Testament of Vanear , and it's a pair of quests I
wouldn't want to do again.
