Very interesting post, thanks. By the way, it's "gyp" not "gip", based on
the etymology of that term for a ripoff....anyway one actual comment on what
you wrote:

Having done virtually nothing but LDoN dungeons since it went live, it is
clear to me that what's "hot" for that purpose is the generalist-type
classes, meaning in no particular order SHM BST DRU BRD RNG. This is
inherent to the structure of LDoN, primarily the time limit of the missions
with all its impacts on group tactics. If the slaughter missions are nerfed,
as I expect they will be, then this will become even more true.
