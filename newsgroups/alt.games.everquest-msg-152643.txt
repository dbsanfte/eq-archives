I am quite the man of the world just like U-God, only not as much. I
asked a few people too:

"When I saw his resume, and saw the important work he did on Mozzila,
I tried to get him to come to terms to work with us, but his price was
just beyond our resources" - Bill Gates

"We begged him and pleaded with him, but he wouldn't get in the hot
tub with us, he just stayed in the goat pen, the next morning he said
he was talking to the goats" - Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Love
Hewitt

"U-God suxors...talk about lame" - His Holiness, Pope John-Paul II

"I would love to have him come over to my Palaces! I hope he brings
his sister and the rest of her flock" - Saddam Hussein
