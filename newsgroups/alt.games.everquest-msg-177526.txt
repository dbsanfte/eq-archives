I just bought the Luclin expansion, and I can't figure out how to make the
new player models work.  Aren't I supposed to be able to look at the
options, and choose a new face?  I thought I read something like that on
this group, but for some reason can't find it on Google now, or anywhere
else for that matter.

Thanks for the help,
Nathan Campbell
