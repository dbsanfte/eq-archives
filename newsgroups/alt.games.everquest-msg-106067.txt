 My definition of a stat is a numerical value within the game that can
be lowered or raised by equipment. That much is fact. What you tested is
what sort of effect that particular stat had on something. That was
completely irrelevant to my statement. 

 In addition to the fact that I used AC mainly as way of comparison to
stating ATK was a stat so thanks for taking my statement out of context
(as witnessed above). As a reminder, what I said was "ATK is most
certainly a stat, just as AC and HP are." I personally can give a rats
ass about the affect AC has. ATK has a definite affect on damage output.
Whether you want to call that a stat or not doesn't change anything.
