Yes please. :)

Pulling mostly, to a group or raid.

Soloing = lost cause these days, I fear. :(

Cool... I figured Ambi to show on that list though?

I'm thinking regen- Yeah, being able to bind to 100% is kinda cool (and 
would make me popular in newbie zones) but when I am feigned at the feet of 
some big nasty with 20HP, I sometimes regret not being a lizard.

Hell yeah :)

I doubt I'll ever see the elemental planes, but I do enjoy some raiding.

Very cool, I will look into that.

Ambidexterity IMO would have to be good- after all, at 252 DW your offhand 
will actually swing 78% of the time (IIRC)... So Ambidexterity would add 
22% to that, meaning an overall 11% more swings per minute- almost like 
offhand haste that stacks with everything. Does it not make your offhand = 
on hand, or are the abilities you listed so cool that they beat it out 
easily?

Holy Shit.

Anyone got a kleenex? I need to get this drool off the keyboard :)
