Out of the top of my head:

Get 3 crystalline silks (unstacked), 1 small block of velium and 1 water in
a pottery wheel.
Combine the result with a High Quality Firing Sheet to get a velium vial.

Now stand at the library and walk to the entrance. The second shop (I think)
on the right has a NPC merchant.
Say to that person "What velium vapors?".
The item you get is a container with 4 slots and a combine button.
Now combine 2 pieces of velium (the stackable version), unstacked, and the
velium vial in the thing you got from the vendor.

Tadaa, Thurgadin Gate potion.

Beware it is Lore so you can only have one in your possession. I myself have
some extra velium vials and a stack of velium pieces in the bank for when I
use the potion I can make a new one immediately.

I got my info from www.magecompendium.com , but www.allakhazam.com should
have it as well.
