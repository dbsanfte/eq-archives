Good Idea.  hopefully there is a bard song that will allow me to snare 
something

That was how we made it to E Karana.  I stood in place until I got my 
bearing and then made a B-line for the old bridge.  It worked.  After a 
couple of times I leaned the land well enough to navigate by memory and 
terrain association (Sun and clouds help as well)

For all the death and destruction and our lack of ability to kill anything other than giant beetles and a young lioness once (most times we had no weapons as we were doing Corpse recover)

It was really fun.  It is so much better being out there than it is to 
be just out the gates of Qeynos.  Got to see the land see giants and 
centuars and griffawns.  The Lions are rediculuous though.  Is it part 
of the story line?

So much fun that I am opening up a business in Qeynos called Luikes 
Corpse Recovery (I got so good at recovering mine that I should help 
others.  Of course I will only accept donations or work Pro-Bono.  But I 
figure, with my travelling song and my corpse recovery song, the higher 
the level I get the easier it will be.  Plus it would be fun to help out 
people like me now.  Giving back is what I say

Luike, Just Luike
