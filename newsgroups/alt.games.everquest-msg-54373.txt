It is over my head.  I really don't grasp it at all.

If there was no message telling you it was happening, how would your life
be different if every person who saw you was automatically forced to
inspect you, versus the way things are now?

Lets say, just for the sake of arguement, that Verant wasn't so lazy, and all
items
had their own graphics.  Now would you care about inspection?

I can tell that it has nothing to do with your complaint, I just don't get
why your complaint is a complaint.

If verant had mad the inspection message off by default, heck, if the
inspection message never existed, would you be this upset?

It is my contention (quite possibly wrong) that the principle reason
people dislike inspection is that the message is intrusive and irritating,
so mutual consensus developed that inspecting was rude; a violation
of common manners.  With the addition of the ability to turn the message
off, the reason for this vanishes, but manners are not based on reason.

Just as whistling in a theatre is considered incredibly rude and unlucky,
inspecting has a vestigial stigmata; historically the stage crews communicated
via whistles, so idle whistling could cause grevious mistakes, curtains
brought down at the wrong time, lights in the wrong place, even dangerous
ones where sandbags drop with people underneath.  Now that communication
is electronicly maintained and stage crews have no idea at all what the
whistle signals are, the prohibition against whistling has no real sense to it.
Traditions being what they are, perhaps a hundred years from now it
will be forgotten.

Assume for the sake of arguement that anyone can see what you
are wearing.  Assume further that you can't tell who is looking and
who isn't.  How does this situation hurt you?

To further compound this question, I don't inspect people.  Why?
Because its been established as rude.  Would I inspect people
if there was not this prohibition?  Usually not, but any time I was
curious, yes.  What is that weird curly thing Joemama is wearing
on his head?  Oh, its a Tonflah, I've heard of those, sure looks
funny on an ogre.  Hmm, level 52 cleric, just like me, wonder
what he's got in his neck slot.  Goblin soulcaller?  Oh, I got rid
of mine ages ago.  No, its a Radiuus Ulna, hmm, whats that?
Hey Silentbob, whats a Radiuus Ulna?

Yep, my life would be measurably improved (not enormously,
just measurably) if I could freely inspect others without being
considered politically incorrect.
