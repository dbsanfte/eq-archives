Stomach's to hold the other ingredients for cooking, like pig stomach
lining's used for sausages.  You don't eat it.

Other way around, actually.  Whisky is the dialect form of uisge
beatha (water of life).

As for the part snipped, it was Robbie Burns' Ode to the Haggis.

And as I'm typin' this, I'm sittin' 'ere enjoyin' me haggis, wi'
chicken gravy an' mashed taters.
