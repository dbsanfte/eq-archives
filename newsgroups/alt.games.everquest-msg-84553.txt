If you don't plan on doing much soloing, the differences between human monks
and iksar monks are largely irrelevant.

Monks have four good quests in the game, total.  Robe of the Whistling
Fists, Celestial Fists (epic), and the shuriken summoning Velious bracers. 
All three are available to any flavor monk.  And the shackle of steel, which
is iksar only, but human monks can buy a reasonable alternative to the
shackle of steel that iksar can't use.  I don't know of any deity-restricted
monk items, though Inny seems to drop some pretty odd bits these days so
there may be something now.

The 20% exp penalty is harsh, and the only way to negate it is to solo.  So
if you don't plan on soloing, thus having AC buffs, regen buffs, and vision
buffs available to you anyway, the penalty is enough to influence a
decision.  Then again, Iksar newbie zones (and by newbie I mean 1 to 45) are
the absolute best experience around.

With all that said, I picked Iksar for my monk.  I started a human monk way
back when EQ first came out, and promptly dropped it the first time I
entered the "twilight" zone.  For me, infravision was the deciding factor in
stopping playing a monk, and in starting one again when Iksar were made
available.
