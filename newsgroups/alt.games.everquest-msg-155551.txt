heals are renowned for NOT giving faction (which can be a good or bad thing)

if your in kael trying to get faction, you should attack the mob (melee or
nuke), as long as your in range, it doesnt matter if you actually connect or
not

For avoiding faction, I found that when hunting in Skyshrine (gives neg CoV
faction) if I only used cheal, and I only healed level 60 people, I never
ever got a faction hit

Spells like divine light (or healing low 50's people) did give faction hits
though

Go figure
