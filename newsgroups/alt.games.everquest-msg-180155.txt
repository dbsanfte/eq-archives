Not nearly as high as they once were.  Our usual group was myself (65 war),
63~ish paladin, 65 druid, 65 enchanter(bot).   They are generally around my
level of equipment, so not nearly as good as what you're wearing, but not
shabby.  HoT / Kael quest, etc.

Depending on who was on, 58~ish rogue or 57~ish warrior might come.   (we
were sort of PL'ing them there, since they couldn't join us in Storm or
above, and getting some very nice "raid level" upgrades with a single
group...  which I didn't really think was possible.)

4c is still the most dangerous camp there, and the only one that was even
close to challenging.  After being used to PoP, the mobs hit like little
girls... but the 4c ones still do thier two fucking annoying special
abilites.    AE poison attack from the necro lizards is the most
dangerous...  although with shaman PR buffs and good poison resist, at 65
you'll probably resist a very good portion of them.     The most annoying
was the "shaman" type lizards, who use Bane of Thule...  AE slow and DoT,
unresistable.  Constant cures were necessary to keep our melees doing
damage.

Your monk could probably tank it easily, as well as providing damage.
Shaman bot with one more healer to cover the AE's would probably be good for
healing. Another one or two to come provide damage would be really helpful.
Bard or enchanter would be super helpful, since theres so many mobs there,
there really isn't time to split them.   And if you get one of the AE poison
rain mobs, at the same time as you get a AE unresistable slow mob, so they
both live forever..  even you might be in a bit of trouble if one does not
get mezed immediately and held that way.

Nothing was unmezzable until we got to the enraged amyglydans way at the top
of the temple (although you probably wont' go that high.  The paladin wanted
their mask. ; )   )

We killed him twice while there...    We gave the fleshgrinder to the
warrior, since it was a real upgrade for him, and just a toy for me, but oh
my god, the earring off that mob... ; )   Just getting that one drop added
120 unbuffed hit points over what I had been using. ; )
