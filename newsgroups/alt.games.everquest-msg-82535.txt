The thing is that that just does not sound quite right.  Though I have never
needed a thurg gate potion myself (being that my main was a wiz till
recently), but I think that for levels 30 and up any non-gating character
would have a use for them.  Why would verant think that a gate potion would
only be needed for doing a quest (especially considering all the whining
melee types do about having to run, boat, beg for port)?
