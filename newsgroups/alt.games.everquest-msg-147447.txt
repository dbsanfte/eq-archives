Well, equal rights, yes.  But I do think slavery disappeared right around
then.  That was what, the late 1860s?  So Wolfie's about 140 minimum now,
right?

I'm just wondering how he knows what it was like in church when they were
fighting against slavery... Unless maybe he grew up in South Africa or 
something.
