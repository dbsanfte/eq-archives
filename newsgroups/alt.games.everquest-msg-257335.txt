This is true, I agree wholeheartedly with the last sentence.  I just don't 
see a big enough advantage to the theoretical 9th slot to make it 
-necessary-.  It's like what Lance was saying about DPS in the other 
thread.  The first 5 slots are absolutely necessary to survive, 6 and 7 
create marked improvement, the 8th adds a tiny bit more improvement, and 
by the time you get to the ninth slot, you're memming something that may 
improve your effectiveness by 1%.  Which may be eyecandy nice, but isn't 
-needed-, and the advantage probably gets lost in the shuffle anyway.

But pretty much the whole -point- of the spellcasting game is 'balancing 
them off in your spell slots'.  The balancing act would be easier at 9, 
true, but there would still be a balancing act.  At least until we get up 
to 30 or so slots, we're gonna ahve to balance.  But the balancing act 
isn't so heinous at 8 slots. Really.

Pretty typical.  I cruise around with FT15 gear though.  Well, 17, 
actually, but there's that darn cap.  Rare is the situation where I'd need 
Scryer's or ToT desperately, and there being the odds of a target that 
has mana to affect at exactly that moment?  Not worth permanently tying up 
a slot for.  Especially in an LDoN!  For unrelated reasons, I ditch the 
PBAE mezz, as well.  But I do keep root up almost permanently.  That's 
just down to style, though.  And I agree about NDT.  Hordes of cackling 
scarecrows rule. :)  But then, thanks to AA's and gear, my NDT lasts 70% 
longer... which is long enough for me to use that as a swap slot, 
frequently.

Basically, it always seems like there's another way to get almost the same 
convenience as that 9th slot.  But what -I'd- really like, is an AA that 
reduces spell refresh times.  Now -that- would be cool. :)

And while we're dreaming, MGB Illusion: Gnome plz. :)

A foolish wish, imo.  Mezz seems to mem blur maybe 20%-30% of the time.  
Not such good odds...  But then mem blur only seems to mem blur 25%-35% of 
the time... And has a much worse refresh time.  And while you're 
determining whether mem blur worked today or not, the mob is still 
pounding on you, rather than waiting for the next tic of the dot to break 
mez.  But even the whole strategy of blurring it off you may not be so 
hot, since as soon as you do, it's making a beeline for the necro, and he 
can't tank very well either. :)  Root the sumbish and move away.

Of course, the ideal solution is to scream bloody murder at the idiot who 
dotted an add. :)  But I'd rank mem blur as pretty much a broken spell 
line.  There may be hope for it after I get those nifty GoD AA's though.

That ranks high on the 'why I don't use PBAE mezz except when CoD 
soloing' list. :)

See, you got room to be swapping in your wimpy damage shield and whatever 
other fun toy you'd like.  You don't -need- an extra spell gem, you're 
doing just fine without it. :)  And for the record, Camp yourself an 
earring of blazing energy in Chardok.  Presto! Chanter damage shield in 
its own custom ear-mounted spell slot!

One other thing mystifies me, though.  He keeps the peridot rune always 
memmed, but only -occasionally- swaps in componentless?  Rich weirdo, I 
guess. :)
