In fact there are a couple of threads at eqtraders going on now where 
people are still disagreeing on exactly these issues.

I always advise the same thing, depending on the tradeskill.  Personally, 
I go for convenience, so, for brewing, I do MHBs, have been for a while, 
and my brewing is only up to 200 now.  For tailoring, it's always 
whatever I can get my hands on that is not trivial.  For smithing, now 
that I have my nifty +15% hammer, I am doing ethereal rings up to 212.  
For baking, it's much like tailoring, whatever I can lay my hands on, 
MTPs are a pain, but I've done quite a few of them too.  For pottery, I 
did whatever was trivial next and required the least amount, if any, 
player enchanted/imbued items.
