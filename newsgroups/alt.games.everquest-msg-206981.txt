The zone line isn't supposed to clear aggro, it's supposed to allow you to
experience wildly different environments without putting too heavy of a load
on your computer, the servers, or the networks they operate on.

See the difference?  :P

No.  Zoning clearing aggro is entirely a byproduct of the nature of the
design decisions made when the game was created to have discreet zones so as
to allow greater freedom of environment, models, etc., without putting undue
strain on the servers, client computers or network of the time.  Other games
have taken different approaches, for instance Asheron's Call's "pop in"
effect.  Until you get the fallacy out of your head that zones are there
with the specific intent to clear aggro...  well, we're not even having the
same discussion.  :)

That's not what happened at the other end.  Previously, it was damn near
impossible to die while zoning at low health because your buffs were
stripped, along with any DoTs and you were set to your base hitpoint value
of your equipment +1.  I used to use this to save myself from dying when I
was soloing the LDCs in Sol B (nasty dot for a solo monk).  Even I
considered it somewhat of an exploit to do so, but I was fully prepared to
spend an afternoon arguing with a GM over whether I'm allowed to zone
whenever I want or must I always petition and get GM approval first.

I'm honestly not exactly sure how it works right now.  I know for a fact
I've zoned at very low health and came out on the other side still at very
low health, and my hitpoints more than doubles when I go from naked to
dressed.

Thanks for explaining feign pulling to a monk.  :P  Unless you are saying
the zoneline snares one mob out of a bunch, your example is a rather odd
choice.
