Ya.. but at the risk of having Dark Tyger blow a gasket, I prefer
fishing cobalt cod with a nostromo game pad.....

Yeah.. but its just the tackiness of it. I'd prefer the quests
actually had a point to them.. a story within the story where you
learn more about the world and it actually made sense. Both the main
strength and its biggest weakness.. is that the EQ game world can
rarely change. As such, its always stuck in that one moment in time
with little chance for real change. Baby jesus cried the day it was
discovered they looped the Plane of Time after Quarm's death so as to
not in ANY WAY change anything. Its hard to get excited about
expansions.. even ones cleverly titled 'Omens of War'... when you know
that in no substantial way can it change the gaming world.. which is
one of the main side-effects of war.
