The snare on it sucks, low enough that injured runners can often still 
move, uninjured mobs you snare in camp to prevent them from getting to 
the enchanter so easy hardly seem slower at all, the duration is short, 
its resisted a lot, and the cast time is an outrage, and its a DOT which 
means you break mez and prevent mez sticking long if you use it.

Its still a lot better snare than what any other shaman or cleric get... 
my dwarf cleric uses a Sap Encrusted Branch, and Proc snare isn't at all 
the same as snare on demand.
