I would get STA to 90, and put the rest in STR.  Maybe 5 in AGI, since it 
is still rumored to help with missed notes, but nobody can prove it.

Who cares?  You regain mana so slowly that having a small manapool isn't 
an issue.  You basically have NO mana, and no reason to use it.  If you're 
doing so much charming in a group situation that you run out of mana, 
learn to mez, seriously.  If you're soloing it's the difference between 
waiting 30 minutes and 40 minutes to regain your mana.  It all works out 
in the end.

Yep, my CHA is 180 or so unbuffed now, in my tanking gear.  I don't think 
I put any into it.

Stats matter less to bards than to any other character.  The only stat 
that matters are INT and DEX, and those are the INT and DEX of the player 
running the keyboard.  Oh, and maybe CHA too, since we're generally group 
characters.
