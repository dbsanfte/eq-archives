As I said previously, one of my goals would be to create a musical =
document that would be here after I am gone in 3.46 years composed of =
music from the past so that you would have something else to help guide =
you.

The main features of the music included will be this

1)Music with lyrics that seem to have some bearing on these end times =
some of which were written as many as 30-35 years ago. BOC, Rush, Jethro =
Tull, Iron Maiden, Queen, Marillion, etc.=20

2)An attempt to show homage to black rap artists to give them the =
respect they deserve, especially the ones with a more negative, =
creative, rebellious attitude. Ice-T, Public Enemy, L.L. Cool J, Mr. =
Snoop Doggy Dogg, DMX, etc.

3)Will probably mix in some classic Christian songs eventually as that =
is the most rebellious thing you can possibly do right now.

Here is the link to the station, it's really rough right now but I =
suppose I have 3.46 years to complete it.=20

I'll be adding some Public Enemy tracks today and posting the lyrics for =
the ones I like on here and posting the lyrics for every song I add, it =
may take a while as I don't know much about Public Enemy, God seems to =
have led my mind in that direction.=20

About 6 months before the end I will put them in order and create kind =
of a countdown of the 500 best ones or something as I like to do.
