     The anon thing and the lack of interracial
communication are pretty why I stopped playing
this server.  If I wanted to play by myself, I
would stick to solitaire and not have to upgrade
my computer.
    If I could design a server I would do things
a bit differently.  My dream server would have
hmmm.....1 character per customer, no triv loot
code anywheres (same as on the regular servers 
now, though some yahoo in WC was /ooc'ing that
the TLC was now in effect on all servers, all 
zones...he got laughed at), very few, if any
no drop or lore items, and NO language 
restrictions.  Mainly, I think it'd be fun
to try a single character server without
having to radically change my play style or
go PVP.
   But, I don't work for Verant, so I guess
it doesn't really matter what I want.
