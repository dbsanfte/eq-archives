I think a lot of us have been playing EQ for such a long time that
we've forgotten what it's like to be a true newbie, not having any
equipment or plat.  Don't believe the folks who are talking about
getting to level 10 in a couple of hours.  Yeah, it's easy to do
that... IF you have a higher level character who is gifting your
"newbie" with equipment that's actually designed for level 40 or 50.

Level 5 or so can be very difficult because you are graduating from
the newbie areas but usually anything in the more advanced areas can
kill you quickly.  All I can suggest is talking to other players and
trying to meet a few people in-game that you like grouping up with. 
Level 5 is fine for grouping.  And don't get discouraged that you
don't have fancy gear.  For me the most "magical" time was when I was
just a young-in and didn't have good gear, and every trip out was an
adventure.

Good luck....
