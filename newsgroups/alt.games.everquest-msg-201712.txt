Yeah, I can see this. I have been eyeing the Crown of King Tranix too- 
maybe I'll just pick one of those up.

Probably not. Then again, those pants are low down on my list and I may 
well be 61 by then.

And 2ac is not "minimal" when you are as close to 1000 AC as I am... I know

Does a tstaff proc more often than my stun clubs?

I was using Peacebringer for quite a while, and it is 10 weight too.
