Even in a group that already has a cleric the shaman will out heal the
cleric?  That's what I'm talking about.  Groups with both a shammy and a
cleric.

How high is "high end"?  And what's the core classes below that?  Would be
interesting to know how they change as you go up in level ... starting from
level 5 and up.  And I notice the enchanter wasn't mentioned above.  I
thought enchanters increased in their group appeal as they rose in levels?

Why?  Why was the cleric unneeded before Kunark?  How did this change with
each expansion?  What's likely the fate of cleric in Luclin?  Would really
hate to be unwanted by groups after Luclin rolls out.
