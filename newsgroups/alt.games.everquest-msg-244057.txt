Assuming this is the only chat channel you are in, you would use /1 <message
here> to talk.  To leave the command is /leave 1.  In the event that you are
in more than one channel, /list will tell you which channels you are in and
which number they are.  /list <channel number> will tell you everyone that
is in the channel.
