Sorry, I was unclear.  I should have said that "[stat-wise] little
matters beyond WIS".  My highest Druid is a mere L37, but he has
gotten tons of mileage out of ac/hp gear (I've mostly played melees,
so that was a natural focus for me, heh), always treating WIS/mana
as a (close) third to ac/hp and useful focus effects (making your
spells more efficient not only makes you effective mana pool larger,
it makes your effective mana regen rate faster).  At L37 his AC is
700ish.  He's not a twink, but he is on FV which makes some slots a
lot easier/cheaper to equip well via the bazaar.  As for stats, I
make sure his STA is 100+, have a very small bias towards AGI, and
am very happy with a 168 WIS, given his level/ac/hp (just under 1100
hp self-buffed).
