No question in my mind that I will be playing EQ2 at release. I have two 
accounts on order and my wife and I will both be playing. I will be a Dwarf 
Priest->Shaman->Mystic and she a Wood Elf Scout-Rogue->Swashbuckler.

I still maintain my EQ account, but I will probably let it lapse once EQ2 is 
released.
