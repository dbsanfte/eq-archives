Hi everybody. I was wondering. I just started playing recently and I just
learned as I dinged level 6 that I was supposed to turn in a note at the
beginning at level 1 to my guild master. I have since either dropped or lost
my note. Im not sure. Am I SOL or is do I really need my note to continue
playing. Thanks for any help.
