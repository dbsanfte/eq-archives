Alchemy is working as intended, and you can improve skill in it. k thx
bye.

...

Alchemy is now working as intended, and you can now improve skill in it.
Sorry for the previously conflicting information

...

Alchemy is now definitely working as intended, and you can definitely
improve skill in it. Honest!!!

While we're on the subject of 'number of pets on mobs' anecdotes without
proof, I'll throw mine in <grin>. As I understand it, you can only have
4 mobs per 'zone' of melee. 4 from the back, 4 from the front, 4 from
each of however many 'zones' the mob has for melee attacking. No, I
don't have proof, nor can I cite, so if that's what you're after, go
look elsewhere. Just throwing in my unsubstantiated 2pp
