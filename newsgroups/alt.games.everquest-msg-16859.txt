It's a matter of what you value more.  I, also, find too often that I've 
valued my faith in people more than platinum or whatever I'm selling.  The 
5% of the time it goes against me, I feel like a total nimrod.  But that's 
a heck of a lot better than having to feel paranoid and distrustful the 
other 95% of the time. 

And it's only platinum...
