With that group you can easily do the libarary (second floor). Nice loot
to be had, steady xp, and the cleric can have a blast with their
anti-undead spells. You can either just set up in the entry alcove
(About every mob on that floor is static) and pull to there, or IVU the
group, run to the exit corridor by the mirror, kill the one there and
pull to the mirror. (Safer, but annoying and you don't get the
librarian, teacher, etc. as much.)

You can try the third floor with that group, though a bit riskier. IVU
won't get you anywhere as it's a mix of mob types and the animated armor
guys hit HARD. If you can make it to the bedroom, though, and hold that
room by the exit mirror, you're golden. If you push it and try to go to
four you will have your asses handed to you on sterling silver platters.

Icewell keep with low thirties? Please refer to comment about fine
silver platters and posteriors above. You'll be evaporated.

That's my guess. I usually don't even answer auctioneers who don't
include prices in their auctions unless it's something I really, really,
reeeeaaaly want, and even in that case, if they respond with "I don't
know. What will you offer?" I generally say "Ten plat".
