What? No alliance possible?  I get it as a 12th level spell, for 
chrissakes. :)

My usual strategy when caster loot drops is to AoE mezz the necro and 
mage (ad their pets, bah!) before they can express interest, since they're 
always standing in the same corner scheming together.  Then I charm the 
Wizard.

Me: "See?  I should get this item.  It's clearly a chanter item.  It even 
     has a point of Cha on it!  You don't need FTIV, anyway.  This is not 
     the drop you are looking for."
Wizard: "Taunting Attacker, Master."
Me: "Utoh."
