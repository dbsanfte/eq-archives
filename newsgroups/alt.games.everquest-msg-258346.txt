I agree, this is a very different matter and I think there is another
distinction you have to make between two separate merging situations:

1) First, the situation you describe, where there's a line of folks exiting
and it's obvious that you either move out of the flow of traffic that is
going past the exit and line up at the end with others waiting to get off,
OR you're cutting in line in front of those folks. I agree, that behavior is
just rude.

2) The situation I first described in my initial response to Foxeye, where
there are two lanes of flowing traffic that eventually merge into one lane
some ways ahead. Let's say the right lane disappears and all traffic is
merged into the left lane. I don't equate the flow of traffic on the left as
a "line" to get to that 80% exit in 1) above. These are both lanes of
traffic headed to the same destination and both are equally valid places to
be with respect to the destination (unlike 1, above, where the non-exit lane
is headed for a different destination). If driver A decides to get into the
left lane because he knows he will have to eventually, God Bless him. If I
choose instead to stay in the right lane where I am nice and comfortable and
I don't have to worry about cars in front of me, and then choose to take my
turn behind anyone who is in front of me in the right lane as we begin our
alternating merges into the left lane, there's no reason for anyone to have
heartburn over this.

Aye, I don't understand that mentality at all, and I love to see those guys
get nailed.

I'm not sure anyone is saying that. I just brought up the topic because the
whole subject of line dynamics is interesting to me. Here's a fun one to
think about. I call it the "Waiting for Red" phenomenon and I see it every
once in a while. Have you ever noticed how startup inertia in long lines is
serial and consecutive? In other words, when the light turns green, the
first car goes through this little inertia startup phase, and finally starts
moving. *Then* the next car does the same, and *then* the next car, and so
on. In a perfect world, all of the cars would start up their inertia
sequence at the same exact time (when the light turns green) and would
continue maintaining safe distances between themselves and move forward as a
group. So, if you're at the end of 20 cars, you start moving as soon as the
guy at the front of the line starts moving. And everyone would roll to a
stop at the same time.

Of course, that's not at all what happens (nor do I think it's even
possible, this is just idle observation :).  What actually happens is a
cascading sequence of startups, as everyone takes turns consecutively going
through their startup phases, such that in a really long line, the guys at
the back will only start moving once the light is red, and they finally come
to a complete standstill when the light is green. They are, in a very real
sense, waiting for the red light to start moving. ;-) Watch for it sometime.
