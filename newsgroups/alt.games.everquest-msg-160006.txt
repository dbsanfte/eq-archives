Doable, I guess, if the Necro is really on his/her toes for the breakin
and there's at least one undead up to charm.  Personally, I think of HS
as more of a 55+ zone if you're going to solo or duo. Those are some
hard hitting mobs, and they can come in swarms depending where you
*ouch* land. he he.

> Chardok (zone in/out)

Great xp in Chardok. Also, if the necro is very careful using the right
combination of invis spells/items, there are some deeper in spots that
can be solo'd. Initial breaks can be rough, but with screaming terror,
pet heals, etc. necros are pretty good at breaking spawns.

> Dragon Necropolis (spiders)

Really? Even with the spiders sending Jabobber half way across the zone
every few seconds? Hrmm... have to suggest that to Tarre. We were
camping them this weekend (got a PSC too! Wheeeeeeee) but we had a full
group of sorts. Ranjah, CHeal Druid, Necro, Wizard, Wizard, Shaman. We
were killing dragon constructs when we could trigger them too. Not much
for loot, but it's a fun camp. Never saw a necro solo there before,
though, and again, 52 sounds kind of young for that. The 49 necro pet
rocks and all, but I think the monk pet (56?) might be required to go
toe to toe with those spiders.

> Sol B (LDC)

Definitely, if you can find a camp open.

> Lguk (frenzy, lord, king, Arch magus)

Probably also a good choice.

At 52 you'd also get amazing xp in the Hole at the entry, if you can
find it open. Get your pet ready and buffed, and have ST ready to help
with spliting adds until you've got the top six elemental spawns broken.
You could ride that all day and the xp at 52 is still out of this world.
Starts to slow down at 54/55, though.

You can also fear kite at the dropoff in the gnoll caves in JP. It's an
outdoor zone, but the xp is still pretty fast because the mobs are so
incredibly wimpy.
