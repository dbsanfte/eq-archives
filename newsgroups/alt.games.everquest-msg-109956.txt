Nah. Any programmer knows that making too many changes at one time is 
just asking for trouble. The "basic structure" they are referring to 
(as detailed in a verbose Test server patch) is their data structures, 
some of which apparently were very poorly designed and/or kludged over 
time. If they're overhauling data structures, it is a good thing that 
they're holding off other code changes until they are sure the new
data structures work as designed.

On the other hand, by they time they push the new data structures
to prod servers I would hope they're already pretty damn sure of that...
