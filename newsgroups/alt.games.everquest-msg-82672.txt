Assuming you can charm animals (or have a friend who can)
you can do the quest for the Initiate Symbol of Bertoxx.  It's
can be done prior to level 10 *if* you can charm animals.
That quest raises Dark Reflection (and lowers the good Ak'Anon
factions, as well, of course.)

There's no way to raise Deep Muses.other than the "newbie note"
quest for clerics or rogues.   You can lower it by killing the guild
leaders, though.  They're level 50.  Both NPCs on that faction are
also on Gemchoppers (and Ak'Anon Merchant) faction, though,
so it's mostly irrelevant.

You haven't said what you're trying to do, though, and that would
be helpful.  Other than "I just want to raise faction" possibility,
the only quest I know that requires you to actually worry about
Dark Reflection faction is the Bullsmasher quest.  Assuming you
need to do the quest several times to get the hammer, you'll
become close to KoS but you're far more likely to give up any
hope of getting it before you're actually KoS if it takes that long.

Anyway, it seems the content designers knew Ak'Anon was going
to be a place you largely left and ignored after Steamfont went
green.  There is simply no easy way to raise any Ak'Anon
faction.  My gnome cleric has better faction in Freeport, Rivervale,
Firona Vie, Thurgadin, and Skyshrine than Ak'Anon. ;(
