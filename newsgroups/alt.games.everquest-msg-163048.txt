My partner was killed today.  Someone decided to kite a few seafuries
on the seafury island.  I suppose it they had levitation and pulled
them out to sea, it wouldn't be such a problem.  But this peep was
running around the island on the shore.  Maybe kiting should be made
ilegal in OOT.  Any comments?
