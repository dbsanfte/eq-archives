I can certainly see that objection, and probably "beauty" was too
strong a word, but if you are looking for a product you can get a
lot of use out of, one where you can start at 20 and stay till 65
isn't one lacking in utility.

I have the same complaint about POP; it was so much better to
level in POP zones that the world effectively shrank down to just
those few, and prior to the trials nerf, to a Very few with
moving on up to the next few a difficult feat to pull off.

POP's been nerfed now so that its merely somewhat better than
anywhere else instead of massively better... I'd like to see a
second nerf, though, killing the entire idea of variable ZEMs, or
at least bringing them in line with reality; Paladul shouldn't be
the Only place worth going from 5 to 25, but it is, and thats
mostly due to its outrageous ZEM.  Likewise, why should PON be
massively more exp per kill than ME or a dozen other zones with
similarly high leveled mobs awaiting slaughter?

If its harder to kill there, then the ZEM should be higher in
line with that... but not far far higher, which is IMO out of
line!
