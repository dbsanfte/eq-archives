*eyeroll* Sure, you make assumptions and they're wrong. The forums are
where they do the most communicating with players. Besides, the
updates haven't been any more than basically "We're still working on
it, sorry, not ETA yet, thanks for your patience". Why do you need
that every hour, anyway?

The only real exception was a post that as an apology, any debt
characters had on them (trade or adventure xp) before today's patch
will be cleared.
