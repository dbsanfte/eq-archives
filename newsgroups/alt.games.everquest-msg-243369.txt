    Monual as Urkel?  I'm sorry, but I can't stop snicker at the image.

    I actually was going to put up a website that showed our various faces,
but then I got a job and forgot about it.  But I've been since laid off..
so maybe I will do it now.

      It's an interesting project, but part of me wonders if it might be a
misguided cause.  Sometimes, in some cases, we might be better off with our
mind's eye guesses left intact rather than crushed by cruel reality.
