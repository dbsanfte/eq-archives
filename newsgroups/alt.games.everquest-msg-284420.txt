Thank you!

[whispers]  I also have Pick Pockets at 199 (1 point off max) but
don't tell the rest of the group I'm with  ;)

I suppose I could just use a skillpoint and a few plat to get to 200,
but that's bordering on cheating/being lazy, at least to me.

Mind you, I don't use the Pickpocket skill on mobs we're fighting,
while grouped with people I don't really know, so as not to take loot
off the rest of the party.  If it's just trash the mobs drop, I ask
them if it's ok to Pickpocket the junk, just for the skillups.  Seems
like good gaming manners  :)
