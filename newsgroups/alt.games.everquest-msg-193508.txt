April 19th 2003

     I have a pentium 4 computer at 1.6ghrz and 512mb of DDR ram and
window's xp home edition.  I am putting in a geforce 4 4200 128mb
card. not a bad system this sound's crazy to me but will I be able to
run with all the model's on and with the texture set to high. with a
high resolution. the people on the EQ message board told me probabally
not. is this true.

Sorry for bothering you folks but some input would be appreciated.
