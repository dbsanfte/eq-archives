If you are a wizzie in your low to mid 40's, here's one thing you can do.
Druids can probably do the same thing with small variations in the
specifics.  Warning, it's a bit long.

Get a SOW potion.  Go to Oasis.  Cast levitate on yourself.  Right click the
SOW potion to activate it.  Go to the island in the middle of the lake and
piss off one of the specs with your Staff of Temperate Flux.  Run over the
water and maybe take a glance back.  Agro range for the specs overlaps, so
you will see your original target and two or three more just like him, all
coming after you.

Now run in a circle over the water, keeping just far enough ahead of them
that you are out of range of their spells.  They don't have great range, and
at your level, you will easily survive a handful of hits with those spells
if you slip up.  Do not let them get into melee range for any reason.  They
hit very hard for their level.

After you've gone a couple laps, the specs should all be standing on top of
one another.  Now take them onto dry land so your spells can hit them, and
snare the whole lot of them.  Then lead them around the desert, hitting them
with your best AoE damage spell as often as you can get the space on them to
get it off.  I used circle of force.  When the specs get a couple casts from
dying, re-snare them, as you are unlikely to kill them before the first
snare breaks.

Once you cast your last AoE, watch 4 exp messages roll by, get your 1 1/2
blue of exp, loot the corpses, and haul your encumbered butt to the gypsies
to sell the scythes.  Or let the lower levels loot them.  Med up and go
again.

Just keep in mind a couple of things.

First, the folks there hunting crocs and orcs will go from full health to
none in seconds if your kite hits them.  You have the SOW and the agro, so
take care to keep the specs safely away from them.

Second, and related to the first, if you lose control of the kite, for the
love of Christ, do not take the specs to the dock.  If you must, shout a
warning to the zone so they'll be on the lookout for the specs, then train
them to the South Ro zone.  Then quit kiting specs until you can kill them
all.
