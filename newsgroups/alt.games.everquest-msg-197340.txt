I understand about being paranoid about giving CC numbers over the net. 
  With EQ, I've never had a problem with double billing or billing 
before due dates, those are my main concerns with subscription type 
things.  If you really don't want to use the CC, someone else mentioned 
the game cards, those work nicely if you can get them where you live.
