Well fastest to 20 is Halfling druid....but it seams every body will think
less of you.And at higher levels you will be unwanted.So I think they are
all the same.You need to ask your self is "Do you want to make it to 60".If
so make a fighter or a magician ,not a half breed.The half breeds seem to be
unwanted in the upper levels.
