Melees in general,  hybreds included, have gotten the shaft so much
these last few expansions that Im wondering why. No question there are
now fewer melees that there used to be now even fewer hybreds. Many
more pet classes being played so one wonders how long this will go on.
Personaly I hate tanking with pets, the push is awful and many dont
control them well.  Perhaps its harder to sell melees on new
expansions...hmm may finally be on to something there.

In short dont count on much being there for us. Im passing on this one
at least for a good long while till I see some benifit for my SK, LoY
was a complete waste for me at least.
