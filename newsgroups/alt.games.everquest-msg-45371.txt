Well, perhaps that is so. I'm not going to the trouble to verify it. :)
I do see that Kurns does not have an xp bonus listed at EQ Atlas.
Most all higher level dungeons do indeed have a bonus, though.

Another possibility is that FoB itself has a bonus. Certain newbie 
zones (LOIO, Butcherblock are two examples) did have dungeon-like 
xp bonuses in the past, though I think those have all gone by the 
wayside by now.

Different type mobs of the same level in the same zone always yield
equal xp, by the way.
