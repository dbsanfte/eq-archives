But why is it OK for druids to advertise "Porting to BB and Toxx, 15pp per
seat"? A rez can save several HOURS, a port can at most save an hour!

I think I've charged once, as I had to zone to get to the corpse, and I was
getting good loot and exp where I was, and the rezz beggar didn't offer any
money in his tells. Kinda hard to leave my spot when I get that kind of a
tell...

However, if someone tells me they'll pay me for a rez, and then say "Oops,
I don't have any money on me", they get on my bad side. "Yeah, I've spent
the last 20 minutes traveling to you, rezzing you, healing you and medding
back the mana used. And now you say you can't pay me the money you offered.
Nope, that's not annoying. Not at all! Have a nice day!"

Hey, I kinda wish more people were less concerned about the exp loss.
Fielding rez requests all day gets to be a bitch, and I don't like going
anonymous, so I get a lot of them...

If any cleric charges groupmates, they should be avoided like the plague.
However, if it's a guildmate, they'd better arrange for transportation
to the corpse. Travel is a bitch for clerics, no ports, SoW or invis...

Fun with rez requests: When I dinged 39, I was in the Overthere, and
didn't have my 39 spells with me. I ended up /ooc'ing to the zone
"NO I CAN'T REZ YOU, I'VE JUST DINGED AND DON'T HAVE THE SPELL!!"
Hey, it stopped the barrage of tells...
