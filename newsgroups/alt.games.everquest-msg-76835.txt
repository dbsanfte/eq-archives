I'd say a bugfix can still be a nerf.  If a bug meets the following
conditions, I'd call its fix a nerf:

1. It is not obviously a bug,

2. It is widely known,

3. Verant has known about it for a long time and not acted and not
stated that it is a bug.

Let's look at these three as they apply to the horse bug.

1. Verant's stated policy is to not tell us how everything works.  We
are supposed to discover what things do, such as spells.  Hence,
finding that a horse does something more for the owner than merely
increase speed doesn't tip us off that it is a bug.  Indeed,
considering that tboots are better than the low end horse for
travelling, we should even expect some benefit to a horse beyond
travelling.  Medding during combat is not really overpowering, so it
doesn't leap out as being obviously a bug that they'd add it.

2. This property of horses was discovered within a day or two of
Luclin's release, and mentioned in most threads discussing horses.

3. Verant has known about it for quite a while.  That question Absor
answered on the official message board was not the first inquiry they
had received.  I asked basically the same question weeks ago, so they
were definitely aware of it.  They surely could figure out that people
were making purchasing decisions based on this behaviour, and work a
short "this is a bug, do not count on it" note into Absor's busy
one-or-two-posts-a-day schedule.
