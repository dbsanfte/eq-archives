Apparently we have some people here like lokari, bizbee, and nagzum that
claim to be contributors to this ng while on the other hand being the
main source of it's disruption by attacking everyone that come in it.
This has amounted to nothing but a news group full of nothing but trash
to read. It appears that these people are intent on keeping this place
looking like nothing more than a dumping ground for everyone's emotional
trash.

Avenger.
