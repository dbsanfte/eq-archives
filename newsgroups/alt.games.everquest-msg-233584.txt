I tried something once where I made a DE cleric and a DE necro (both
worshipping Inny, of course, since that's the only deity DE clerics
and necros can worship and those classes can't be agnostic) and went
to Qeynos with both of them and checked the /con messages for the
Qeynos guards.  The cleric was dubious while the necro was
threatening.  So apparently the Qeynos guards can tolerate clerics,
even DE ones or others that worship an evil god, as opposed to those
scummy necros!  ;-)  

(DE SKs might be threatening also, I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be
surprised.  I think agnostic DE are also dubious with Qeynos guards,
but not sure about that either)

(I also tried the /con message with the necro, the cleric and an
agnostic DE mage I made with those halfling Leatherfoot scout mobs in
Nektulos Forest and they were threatening to the cleric/necro and
dubious to the mage.
