Chipped Bone Rods are your friend.  Costs a hefty 10p from potion vendors (I
think all starting zones have them...the one in Kelethin is the guy on the
platform outside the bank) I think (no more than that...but maybe 3p) but
like someone else said, it has 3 charges of Locate Corpse.

A friend of mine always used to have one in the bank ready. :)
