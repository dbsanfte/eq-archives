If you change the rules of the game, is it still the same game?

If you allow the king in chess to move like a queen, is it still chess?

The original question was the maximum level in Everquest, not the maximum
level on a server hacked from Everquest. Everquest is the name of a product.
If it has been hacked, it's not Everquest. The existence of rogue servers
does not affect the features and limitations of the actual game.

In Everquest, the maximum level is 50 if you have only the original game,
60 if you have any of the three next expansions (Kunark, Velious, Luclin)
and 65 if you have Planes of Power. (I don't know whether LoY gives you
levels 51-60 or not.)

If you're going to also allow the limitations of hacked versions, the
question becomes meaningless. The maximum level becomes whatever you
can hack into the game engine. It might as well be six hundred billion.
