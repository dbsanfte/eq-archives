A lot will depend on your hp total.  I do the cannidance, as I sold my 
lizard off, needed the cash.  I use Cann4 and Kragg to heal back up.  
Takes 2.5 cycles as I recall to get to fm.  Been a while since I have 
actually tested how fast I can do it.  I usually am grouped with someone 
for KEI or better, and I have FT3, and MC1 which helps some.  As I 
recall, I can get 46 mana/tick just from canni/heal, then add in 
meditating most of that time, and FT3 and MC1.  Last time I recall timing 
it was level 61 I think, so 260 wisdom for mana pool, +mana items.  
Around 3k mana pool at a rough guesstimate.  Yeah, probably about 3.5 
minutes, or about 2.5 canni/heal cycles is what it was with KEI, would be 
a touch over 4 minutes without KEI.  Full buffs on me and pet takes 
another canni/heal cycle or so.  I have not timed it at 63 with a bit 
more mana from items and Wisdom.  Wow, how long does it take to actually 
med back 3k mana?  Looks like 11 to 12 minutes if just sitting and 
medding at a guess, with my AAs.
