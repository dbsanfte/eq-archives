Hardly. One doesn't need to be a hacker to look at a message header
and run a tracert. The message header is part of every message posted,
and tracert is included with most operating systems - they're hardly
'elite' tools. Perhaps *you* think that sort of simple stuff is
hacking, but I'm quite sure Stanmann doesn't.

>Kind of sick actually, how he puts in that personal stuff in a reply

You're really reaching now, Drake. That "personal stuff" is coming
from the original poster, and is available to *anyone* who bothers to
look at it.


StanMann was trying to be helpful. *You* are the one attacking him for
it. Who is the sick one?
