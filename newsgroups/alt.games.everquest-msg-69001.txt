The point is that raving and foaming around the mouth like a newbie
lunatic isn't doing anyone any good.
BTW: new record for memory leak: a groupmate went LD and didn't come
back for quite a while last night. When he finally returned, he'd had
to sort out a major crash, which was caused by EQ caching 3 gigs on
his hard drive. (Part of the patch message today made me wonder if
they're trying to change part of that caching problem from a bug into
a feature :) )
