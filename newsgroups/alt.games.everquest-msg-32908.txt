ROFL...and I bet you sit there all day typing /<enter> and looking at new
names you can report...don't ya "Captain I can't play EQ worth shit so I'll
spend my time fucking with other peoples game"?

I believe it has plenty of bearing if you feel the need to stop your
GAMEplay to take the time to report someone's name...then you are in fact
taking the GAME way too seriously, just as you're taking this lame fucking
thread too seriously and feel the need to defend acting like a childish
NARC.

I've found that feeling the need to post in a public thread you've actually
defeated someone only shows that you're grasping at straws and hoping others
will agree and understand.
