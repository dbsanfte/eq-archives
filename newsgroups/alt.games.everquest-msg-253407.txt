If you want experience to roll in at a reasonable pace, you must
group.  Unless things have changed much, and they may have changed in
the past two years, getting a (non-guild) group for a Ranger in the
50s is a real bitch.

Sorry, but when the previous poster wrote: "Fearkiting animals was the
fastest xp I ever got in EQ up to level 55,and this with zero
downtime." ...It led me to believe that he was comparing solo
experience to group experience.

...since through most of that time, it is impossible to solo reds,
yellows, or even cons.  In fact it is pretty much impossible to solo a
mob that is less than 2 or 3 levels below you.

I fearkited bats in Tenebrous Mountains (cannot be snared--I *think* I
did this somewhere in my 40s...its been a long time), Anacondas and
Griffons in JPF, rats in PoJ, Stalkers in PoN, rats in PoD (those can
be a real bitch), velium hounds and elephants in WW...  Everywhere I
went, if the mob was anywhere close to my level, fear would not take
hold or would wear off after one tic.  When fear wears off on a mob
that you are smacking from melee range, you get smacked.  When the mob
can double or quad for 250+ and you are a weenie 52 (or whatever it
was when I first tried doing PoD rats) Ranger, you can lose a third or
more of your HP from fear wearing off *once*.  Now when you consider
that fear will wear off again and again while you are in melee range,
you wont be lasting long before having to kite it for a while and
heal.  Pretty soon, you are out of mana.

...this is all assuming you managed to snare the bastard in the first
place.  It may have resisted three or four times already.

Therefor, the only way to solo anything is to solo something that will
remain feared for a while, will not resist fear most of the time, and
that will not take a third or half of your hitpoints every time it
gets a chance to smack you.

> And yes, necros solo better and easier, whats new.

You have a delightful ability to miss the point.

You shouldn't doubt it.  Necros can take down deep red cons with
relative ease.  The usual limiting factor is whether or not you can
land a snare on it, several times during the fight.  Taking down a
simple yellow or close-red is no trouble at all if you know what you
are doing.  (You do meet the occaisional Necro or Druid who doesn't
understand the basics of agro kiting.)  And the important part is that
when you are done, you are ready for another already.  The experience
*flows* in.  I take my 59 necro now to PoV and solo OC for amazing
experience.  It's amazing not just because the mobs die reasonably
fast but because the second the mob drops, I'm ready to pull another.
