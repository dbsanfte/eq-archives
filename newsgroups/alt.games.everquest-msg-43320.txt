Myself and several others from Tholuxe Paells server are trying to get
together an Unofficial fan faire type thing going for early next year in
Toronto ontario. so far no date has been set and its early on in the
details. just wondering how many people here could get to toronto should
this come to pass.
all would be welcome from any server. it would probably be at an internet
cafe rented out to us. cost would probably just be the cost of renting the
place divided by people coming. food would pot luck. everyone bring
something to donate to the group. and paying for you own lodgeing. for the
paranoid among you who are worried about the computers stealing your
passwords. bring your own computer hard drives if you want.  although it
wont be a problem since being at an internet cafe they will only install eq
for us all on there computers. they wont let us install our own programs.


Idea's? feedback? questions? interested?
