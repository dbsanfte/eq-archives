Not much. The PoK zone, has a spell library (doesn't have spells that are
location-specific, such as the various Druid ports and the Magician summoned
items, or Luclin spells), and tradeskill item vendors, plus ports to various
cities in the game (all the player starting cities, plus FV and OT) and the
Nexus.

My main is a lvl 33 Magician (close to hitting lvl 34; need slightly less
than 2 bubbles), and I bought PoP strictly for the transportation system.
Can't do most of the quests until at least lvl 46, and from what I've heard,
the quests that involve the new planes shouldn't even be attempted until at
least 55.
