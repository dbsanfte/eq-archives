Hello All,

I plan to start a new character on Firiona Vie as soon as it goes live and
was hoping some of you had some ideas. I'm fairly new to EQ (3mos +/-) and
currently have 2 chars on Vazaelle. A 13 Halfling Rogue and a 7 Barb Shaman
which I enjoy emensly albeit getting a little bored with the rogue at the
moment. Anyway, I wanted to know what the thoughts are on race/class
advantages based upon the new rules in FV. I know, "play what you like", and
I'm considering a High Elf caster-type, but not really sure how the rules,
etc. will affect the certain character options. Please advise and if you are
going to start an alt on FV, what will you be?

Thanks,
