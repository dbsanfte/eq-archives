Had my second LD death a few days ago.  Was running across OT, didn't have
levitate going, when, you guessed it, major packet loss, LD.  Log back in,
watch a cliff fly by, you have taken 10000 points of nonmelee damage,
LOADING PLEASE WAIT...  Fortunately for me, a couple of guildmates came to
my rescue, high level druid dragged my corpse out of the pit, high level
cleric xp rezzed me.  I believe I was level 32, barely at the time, lost my
level until the rez.  The first LD death was fighting a mob, had to just
suck that one up.  I would advise finding a good guild, you will often find
that things like death are nowhere near as inconvenient as they used to be.
