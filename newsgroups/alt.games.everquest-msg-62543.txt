Actually a far easier way, especially if not a strong swimmer is to
instead get on the ship to overthere at the ogre dock. If kos I think
you can still swim out a ways and get to the very end of that dock
where they won't aggro on you.

Then you can take the evil ship all the way down to just where the
iksar master island is in view, at about neg 6000 pos 4000, and jump
off a ways before it zones into the overthere zone. 
Then you swim straight south to the iksar master island, run south on
it as far as you can (saves you even more time than swimming would)
then you swim south down to neg 12200 pos 4360, skirting the raptor
islands,  but are ONE HECK of a lot closer to the firepot than if you
swam from where the barge entered timorous deep which would be a hella
long swim ;) .

The absolute best way to use the firepot room if you are a good race,
in my opinion:

Bind or get bound in firiona vie.

Leave firiona vie on the boat and jump off the boat near the golra ice
glaciar, which is past the elven outpost, and  at the loc:

neg 8500 neg 5000 or so.

Swim as much south west as possible until you hit the rock wall
surrounding that hidden oasis at about:

Neg 11000 neg 2000

Follow the wall (you swim faster when going along the edge of things
at an angle) west to about neg 12260,   0  , then go directly west to:

neg 12260 pos 4360, the firepot room.

Nice option for a good race, just too bad the firepots don't go to
velious also =/
