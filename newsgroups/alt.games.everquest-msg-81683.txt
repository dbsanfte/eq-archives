[snip something about following a pony]

Our group was /following a member from NK to the arena this weekend (with a
bard speed song). When we got to aviak city the leader (followee?) ran up
the ramps to the bird city. The rest of us stayed on the ground
auto-following in circles at a high rate of speed, crashing into each other.
It took about two seconds for us to realize what he'd done, release
ourselves from /follow and crack up laughing.
