A burning affliction item and affliction efficiency item almost doubles your
dot mana.
I got a zlandicars heart for the regen and bandaged while sitting but they
are about 40Kpp
Clarity may be better for mana rather than self hp/mana regen using zheart
but never had to go get buffed.
I tanked while pet beat on mobs back as much as I could to get defense up
and piercing for what its worth.
Robe of abrogation. Frost ? cloak are cheaper regen items.
