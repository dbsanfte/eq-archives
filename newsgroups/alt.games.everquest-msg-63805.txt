After you have the warbraids, all you need is a method to keep from getting
whacked by Rottgrime and his marines as you turn them in.

On another thread, someone said that you can get a non-KOS person to hail
Rottgrime, which will get him to turn around.  This will get him and the
marines facing in the same direction, so you could theoretically sneak
behind them and turn in the braids...
