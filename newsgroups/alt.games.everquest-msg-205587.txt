Which is why I always ask the raid leader on mobs I am uncertain about.  
First off, I need to know if they are slowable, secondly, if I am likely 
to get resisted.  Depending on the mob, one resist can be all I get as I 
will be dead if I get the agro, and I get a resist.  It's amazing how 
fast a single mob can chew through 4200 or so hp wrapped in tissue paper 
chain armor.
