It is extremely good for a shaman, slow on inc, lots of aggro, med while 
standing up. Epic mob then start chaining jbb for some extra damage. 
Without horse a lot of mana is lost from casting those things. Pretty

Or why not the bridle itself? If you already have a horse up it's 
instant. Also works good to refresh spellgems quicker after a cast.
