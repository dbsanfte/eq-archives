I have at the moment two bags of Small bricks of velium in the bank. I
can get 4pp from a merchant per brick, but I presume they must be used
for making something; armour presumably. Anyone confirm this.

On a seperate note, why is Crystal Caverns so underpopulated,10 people
including my little trio at its busiest, I made more PP in 4 hours
last night than in 3 weeks in The overthere, Velium weapons, black
pearls and other gems and also a herbalists pack and a crystalline
belt, keeping my fingers crossed for CCS and Ry'gorr oracle cloak. :)
