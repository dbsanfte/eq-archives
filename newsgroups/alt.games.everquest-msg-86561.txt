My DE rogue is running through Cabilis with her Iksar-Hide mask on and
sees a gnome running the other way. I ask him if he's lost and he
tells me he's fine, having maxed out his Cabilis faction in Old
Sebilis.

I think nothing of it, since as a rogue, I was able to sneak/hide into
Cabilis, stand behind the banker, and be out of view of all but Legion
of Cabilis types to do my banking even before I got my Iksar Hide
Mask. Then, I realize I'm wearing my Iksar Hide mask and can't see
invisible.

You tell foolish_gnome_01, 'You do know that there's more than one
faction in Cabilis, don't you?'

foolish_gnome_01 tells you, 'I do now. Could you drag my corpse to the
zone line, please?'
