It depends.  If it's just a pointless cascade thread, then you're just
going to read the latest stuff.  If it's an actual argument or
conversation, you're going to look at the other posts in order to
prepare a relevant and meaningful reply.  Also, top-posting keeps one
from responding to specific points without having to waste time
explaining which points one is responding to.  For instance, my reply
has two parts two it, this being the first part, the second part being
the rebuttal against the point that newsreaders truncate posts.  This
reply would make a lot less sense if both parts were posted up top
without reference to the points being rebutted.

Those must be ass-long posts.  Which brings up another reason not to
top-post:  snipping.  You can't snip a top-post thread effectively.

because Atma's just too damn attractive to get away from.

Gave 7499 Netstalker Points to Cypher because there's no such thing as
a good day on AGFF without JT bashing!
