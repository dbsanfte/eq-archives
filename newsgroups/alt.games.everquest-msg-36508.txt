You haven't been at the mid/high end much have you?  Where the primary tank
getting smacked with a
40-70% slow and it staying or getting dispelled can be the difference
between the tank keeping aggro until the bastage dies, or somebody else
getting aggro (enchanter or cleric especially) and dying, making it MUCH
harder to keep the remnant of the group alive in the face of adversity.
Rather hard to un-slow the tank if you have to chew through all his buffs
(and that process is bad in itself, makes for a easier to kill tank).

But I suppose you're right, as long as you're hunting orcs in EC or Gfay.
