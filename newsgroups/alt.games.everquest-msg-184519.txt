Possibly, but it is a valid point.

One of my big draws to the woman who is now my wife was the fact that she,
like me, enjoys video gaming. Had she not, I probably would not have
continued to date her. Because in my experience, women who are not gamers
tend to view them as a colossal waste of time and are completely incapable
of understanding why their gamer men do not agree. It would have inevitably
caused us trouble down the line.
