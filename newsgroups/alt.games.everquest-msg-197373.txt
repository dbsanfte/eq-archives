Hehe...  Shamans are WAY behind enchanters on the 'not enough spell slots'
thing, mon amis.  I swap in about 12 to 14 spells IF I have a shaman in the
group; if I don't, I'm slowing too so add in another spell.

The secret to success?  Get a horse.  Nothing like being able to swap spells
midfight without drawing aggro for sitting down.
