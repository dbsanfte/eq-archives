Got bored today, so I decided to make a character I've never done before: an
Erudite Shadowknight. Running around Paineel, I found an NPC who gave an
interesting quest:

(note - he was upstairs when I found him)

[Sat Aug 18 14:50:19 2001] You say, 'Hail, Sejako Mujan'
[Sat Aug 18 14:50:20 2001] Sejako Mujan says 'Shhhh....keep your voice down
lest you wake Alaria. We can [speak elsewhere] if you wish.
[Sat Aug 18 14:50:30 2001] You say, 'can we speak elsewhere'
[Sat Aug 18 14:50:30 2001] Sejako Mujan says 'Follow me and we shall discuss
how you may assist me with my [current research].
(at this time he walked downstairs, and I followed him till he stopped)
[Sat Aug 18 14:50:53 2001] You say, 'what current research'
[Sat Aug 18 14:50:53 2001] Sejako Mujan says 'Recently patrols have been
sent to the Stonebrunt Mountains to investigate rumors of an alliance
between the Kejekans and Erudin. There is much spiritual activity in that
region of Odus and the patrols have reported encountering massive beasts
called Titans. These titans exhibit abilities that lead me to believe they
are powerful animal spirits that have somehow taken on a physical form in
order to enter and manipulate the realm of the living. I require [samples]
of the Titans physiology in order to further my research.
[Sat Aug 18 14:51:26 2001] You say, 'what samples'
[Sat Aug 18 14:51:26 2001] Sejako Mujan says 'There have been sightings of
Titans in many forms. The samples I require are the fangs of the leopard,
sabretooth, and gorilla titans, and the rattle of the snake titan.

Now, I read somewhere about the SB beastiary, and animal Titans were in
there. They are supposed to be HUGE versions of whatever creature they
represent. I just wonder what the reward will be.
