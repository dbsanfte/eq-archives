    My rogue started there at 49. But she came with her own group. Other
groups would not have let her in, as they would feel she was not doing
enough damage compared to the amount of XP she'd suck up.

    No, killing mounds of low blues is one of the best ways to get XP. And
the spiders are blue through 60 - they fit the bill nicely.
