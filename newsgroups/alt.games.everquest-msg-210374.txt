You know, you give me great hope for the fights I'm looking at in the near
future.  I've heard horror stories about the RZ fight, but if *any* guild
can do it with 35-40 people I guarantee my guild can do it with 50.  :)

I still don't think it's likely that your clerics worry about healing anyone
else if they are on CH rotation, particularly if they are 2-boxed.
