Yeah, so, there we were in Rujarkian with a 30-something group. The
ranger that was pulling (Recipe on Tunare) kept running a head the
instant each mob fell and pulling another. He lost the ML several
times getting too far ahead, the healer didn't have time to med (thank
god it was a shaman and he could cani for mana), and he ran through
several floor traps (I know, floor traps are mild, but it's still
stupid). Finally, I started bitching at him about losing the ML so
many times, and he responded with "SHE lost US, no one else is having
trouble keeping up!" Yeah, asshat, because no one else is having to
stop to loot. *sigh* Told him that with such reckless running around,
he's lucky we haven't all gotten killed yet. He says "These are all
like this, get used to it!" Funny, I says, I've been on over 20 of
these and this is the first one with such an idiotic puller. I guess
he didn't like that, 'cause he immediately disbanded me. Too bad for
him the ML didn't like THAT, because she left right after. The shaman
was worried about not looking bad, so he hung around to the end, but
he said he woulda left long before otherwise. So, ML, Shammy, and I
meet up back at camp and split loot amongst ourselves.

As much as I hate dying, I wish we hadn't been so lucky. A full group
wipe or two to blame on that asshat MIGHT have driven the point home
to him...
