But you see, the exact same logic applies to -telling- them not to respond.  
The fact that they do respond in a manner thay seems hormone fueled and 
ranty suggests that just maybe they disagree with you, and that you may want 
to reconsider the validity of your point.  

In this case:  yes, stupid parents does not automatically imply stupid 
child.  However, there is substantial psychological research to suggest that 
it happens 9 times in 10.  And the original population-study argument that 
point was supporting is also statistical.

I'm afraid idiots -are- outbreeding us.

Go fuck.
