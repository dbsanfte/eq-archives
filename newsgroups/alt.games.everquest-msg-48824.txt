Bullshit.  You own remarks concerning my posting your name also involve you
posting my name *before* I even bothered using yours.
I haven't posted with my name in over a year and a half.  You even
proclaimed to have killfiled me as il128 *long ago* want me to pull that
post up for you, Ron Green?
This all occured *well before* your attempt at a pissing contest with me.
Telling a lie, Ron Green?
