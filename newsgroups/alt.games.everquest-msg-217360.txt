Hello,

I suggest you start playing your WIZ in LDON.  Here are the reasons:

No guild needed, just find groups.

Drops off named are decent twink and high lvl usable if you don't have
better.

Spell and Armor adventure purchases are very good and you are
GUARENTEED the item(s) once you have earned enough points to make
purchase.

ATM points are very easy to aquire as the mobs in LDON are not
difficult.  What makes LDON so challenging is the 90 minute time
limit.

Wizzes make nice additions to LDON groups as they are great for
casting final blow DD so that the tank can start in on the next
target; you will be welcomed in most LDON groups.


The plat drops are very nice, so buying that uber gear will be
possible.  In a typical slaughter adventure, 3 - 5k pp worth of gems,
merchant, weapon, and plat will drop; split 5 or 6 ways is not too
shabby at all! I earn about 60 - 80 percent of an AA point every
"slaughter adventure"  Killing 58 - 60 lvl 58+ mobs in record breaking
speed causes that!  in one month I have added 40 AAs.  Not stoo shabby
at all.  This will help you in your lack of "uber gear" short
commings.

Then there are the armor and weapon drops that make for good Bazzar
sales should you win the rolls.  99 percent of the groups allow ALL
members to roll on dropped items.  Only once did I ever experience
"need before greed" crap in a group, and I have added those people to
my ignore list so I won't have to deal with that BS again.

Hopes this helps.
