Which is one of the reasons why the high end game means so little to me. It
becomes Quake with a spells and swords and a similar attitude. New
zones/Encounters are learnt and studied in the same way a new map would be
for an FPS game.
This is something I could never bring to EQ, I had Q3 for the competitive
stuff and couldn't see EQ in the same light...

My favourite name whine was someone with the Surname of "Ubernuker"
complaining that someone else's name was inappropriate, when I pointed his
name out and suggested maybe his horse wasn't so high he explained how he
considered his name to be in the spirit of a Fantasy Role Playing game. Yeah
right, just pure Tolkien that name...In fact I'd be surprised if a character
with it doesn't show up in one of his other works.
Life's too short arguement I find pretty empty considering what we do with
much of our spare time.

Can't have loss for something you have not possessed and, given his level
and guild, I doubt he would have much to do with anyone that has an issue
with inappropriate names.

What I would really like is the ability to selectively not see names. Add
the name to ignore, not only do you not see anything he says to you, you
don't have to read his name proclaiming himself to be "Da Man"
