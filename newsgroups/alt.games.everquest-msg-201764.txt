Racing home on a Friday and grabbing your books and a bag of dice with about
20 sets.. because for some bizarre reason you had a set that rolled well
that night.
My most memorable games were a series we played our characters all of the
way from lvl 1.. right through to lvl 38 (Which might not seem like much in
EQ terms, but when sitting in a mates dining room smelling of cold pizza and
flat coke.. its a herculean effort)

I know its a little odd, but sometimes I really would like to get together
with the guys, and do it all again for the adventure and the oddity of it
all.
