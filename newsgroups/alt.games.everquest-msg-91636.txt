That's true, but I don't see the point for the original discussion.
For most places I know for exp grinding (LOIO, DL, OT etc), where lots
of people are, there's nearly no danger in case of a runner. Snare was
mostly a nice convenience, which I like.

My points were made with the standard locations for people in mind. Of
course you can find special corners, where a wiz would help, but you
have to think to find them. I don't really have to think for why a
cleric or a shaman benefits the group, or a warrior etc. The topic of
this thread is 'Question on the value of Wizards'. My answer is based
on the fact, that the question is aimed at level 1-60 in terms of
general expgrouping. And in this range, what I aready stated, most
other classes offer much more than a wiz to a group, and this in most
locations the people are. Finding reasons in which special cases a
wizard is of use in this context is nitpickyness.

Healing is very much needed. At higher levels, slowing is alos
quiteoften a need. And this is 'need' in some statistically sensible
sense, for a group to be efficient. Of course you can have a group of
6 warriors kill a mob and then sit on their ass 2 hours till they have
their HP back. Healing sin't needed. It's a ridiculous thought,
though, and in such a situation I call it a need.

It wasn't a boast. I just notice my SK does that damage and would
outdamage the mentioned wizard fast. He uses a 33/44 damage weapon,
though. Another SK in the group had a similar weapon. Twinks are quite
common, comparisons to a newbie with his 40 delay 7 damage axe aren't
very sensible.

Not at all. Maybe you fial to notice, that nearly no group invites a
wizard over another class. Most people ideals class for exping is
about 1 Tank, two melee damagers, a cleric, a chanter and a shaman, at
least in higher levels. Nearly nobody would trade any of these with a
wiz. It's common knowledge and common action. If you call everybody a
jerk who didn't like your class, it's rather you ending up in trouble
I guess. Most people in EQ that I know whant to level, as fast and as
efficiently as possible. If you want a group as a wiz, play with
friends who you group with daily or so.

Nope, doesn't happen. Like said in another posting, I love wizards 55+
with dragon and giant bane spells etc. But that's in raids with 30-60
people. A wizard or me is hardly there, because we like or dislike
each other. We're there to do our raid job. And in any nonraid exp
group, like I said, I prefer groups with no wiz in. By the way, there
is a way for wizards to have big fun: AE groups. Some wizards for AE
damage, some chanters for AE stun .. it's some of the biggest fun I
ever had.
