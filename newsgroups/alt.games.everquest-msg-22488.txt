I've been told that doing that deliberately in certain locations.  ie
forcing a mob to poof in run mode by making it pass through a zone line
or poof spot is an exploit.  although again, most of those spots are
level 1-15 so.... 

Just be careful when hunting the Cubert.  if he passes the zone line he
will poof... and you don't want that.
