There is such a beasty - don't know the name of it.  Was grouped
with a guy once running a real time log parser on the same machine
as he was running EQ in EQW.  After a fight he'd check the DPS
(This is how I know that a top con 54 water pet will out damage
a 55 ranger (FBSS/Jagged Sword of Mourning/LSoEE) by a large margin
on low blue xp mobs.)
