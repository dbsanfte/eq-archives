Last night a couple of groups from my guild were in the Arena in Kael
killing mobs and working on faction. The Raid Leader says over guild
chat "Sev is up. Leave Kael now".

I have no idea who Sev is, but judging from the reaction of my guild
mates I guessed he was a dragon. My guild had never taken on a dragon,
mostly because it was hard to get us together with a RoS dragon. (I'd
suggested giving dragons daytimers but nobody liked the idea). 

I port my group to EJ and everyone starts buffing up. We have 29
people there. As Sev dispells we all get junk buffs first. The Raid
Leader asks me to be the puller. My instructions are: go north and
track the dragon. When you see him you've got aggro. Bring him back to
the melee types (who were standing away from the caster types), run
into the corner and die.

When everyone is ready I head north. I track to Sev. He's sitting
there in the distance not moving. I move a bit closer and suddenly
he's not where he was sitting. I click my "incoming" hotkey and run
like a bunny.

I see the "you have resisted...." message several times as I lead him
back to the others. As instructed, I run into the corner where the
melee types are waiting, turn and wait to die. 

Severilous charges me and does a couple of bubbles of damage. I resist
the breath weapon. He turns and attacks the melee types. I heal myself
then set about chloroblasting the MA. Sev downs 4-5 people. We down
Sev. He drops a scale, book, bag, 2 orbs of tishan, and 3 60 spells.

Woot! I helped kill a dragon!
