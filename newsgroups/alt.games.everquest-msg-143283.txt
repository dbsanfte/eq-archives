Are the zelniaks and stonegrabbers in that zone different than the ones in 
Dawnshroud? In DSP the lightcrawlers are a horrible annoyance, even when they're 
green they've managed to attack me through my hiding and get me to 8% while I was 
off going to the bathroom (that sucked). The zelniaks and stonegrabbers aren't 
agro in DSP though, and they aren't social either. They're easy to round up since 
they don't pull their friends along.
