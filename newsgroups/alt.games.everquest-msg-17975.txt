Well, there's also the problem of people not knowing what each class can do.
I was in CC a few days ago and there were 2 SK's and a war who REALLY had no
idea what class can cast what.
I am a mage. The SK's and war (tanks from now on) have asked me to: buff
him, give clarity, root the monster, cast levitate, cast SoW, revive and
port him out of there. This was asked during 2 days, the tanks all got a
decent tell first stating that I was a mage, only had a pet, damshields,
nukes and could summon items for them. After the 6th wrong question I just
dumped the lines in a hotkey and /ooc them whenever one of the 3 asked
another thing I couldn't provide.

Best laugh I had was when one of the SK's came up to a wiz in my group and
asked HIM (name included in the question) for some summoned bandages. I
pressed the ooc hotkey again and gave him 2 stacks.

All the tanks there were lvl 33+ so they weren't all new to the game either.
