Depending on what you are going to be doing, SOW is usually your best friend in the world.  Selos is
useful only for crossing large distances very rapidly, for pulling in large sparsely populated areas, and
for certain SOW+ speed mobs.

49 selos is a different kettle of fish, but until you get that, SOW saves you a slot each twist.

I joke with druids, particularly my 62 druid friend... her SOW is still desperately slow compared to
selos... but until I hit 49 I was happy to even have Tboots on.

SOW is faster than almost every mob, and if you happen to get stunned, you won't lose SOW, its actually
safer for crossing dangerous areas, too.  And of course it lets you cross indoor zones at high speed,
something pre 49 selos is almost useless for, and even 49 selo may not let you get to your destination
before dropping., indoors.
