 What a stupid response from someone clearly wanting to take a shot at me
simply because you are a Druid.  How childish.
I group and solo all of my characters at different times.  As for class envy
where do all of you get class envy?  Is that something you believe or just
something to say for lack of a comment, it's everyone against me because I
posted something you didn't like.

Don't worry about my cleric healing you because none of you will ever get a
heal,  a clarity from my Enchanter, or assistants from any of my characters
when you tackle something then type /shout need a little help with this
hill giant can someone blast it once I'm oom.

 The most amazing thing yet is only one person out of nearly 100 responses
to my post actually had the capacity to understand what the original post
was about.  Everyone else simply responded with an insult like the message
was calling to nerf Druids.  Like sheep the others followed right along
commenting on their post instead of the original.  And have the audacity to
lecture me on newsgroup etiquette and comments about English lessons and
some sexual fantasy curve has.
