Great story Kuloth.

I, too, dream of being the MT someday with my pally alt, although I know
it'll never happen.  The closest I come is when I get aggro in Phase 3 of
Time and find a couple of druids and clerics healing me until a tank gets
aggro off of me (or they themselves get healing aggro).  Kinda fun to stand
there and be healed a bit.  =)

Just wait until you do the Rathe Council - you'll probably find yourself
tanking one of the council all by yourself, with a coupla healers keeping
you pumped up.

I really loved your description of being the MT, however briefly.  Good
writing there; makes me feel wistful that I'll never experience that.
