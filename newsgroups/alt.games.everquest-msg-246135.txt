Ok here's the two things from my experience with my geerlok (I quit shortly
before LDoN came out)

a) It does not affect your listed skill. So if your JC is 215, it really is
215. You add 5% to that to get 225 'effective' skill

b) You can make things for skillups that are trivial above your actual skill
be below your effective skill, just fine. With jewelcrafting, you can
actually make a (small) profit going from 200 up if you use enchanted metal
since the product sells for more than the components, and with the geerlok
your success rate is so high if you keep to things 2-5 points above your
actual skill. I think I made about 1000pp... it was a long and painful
process though. Would be faster with the mass enchant spells, which were not
in when I level JC.

(Side note: I can make more money much faster killing things, so I would not
recommend this as a 'get rich quick' scheme... it's not.)
