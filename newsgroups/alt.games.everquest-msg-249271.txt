The game accounts are not transferrable. (at least the PC ones aren't)

Phone Sony. They *might* make an exception to get a subscribing 
customer. Don't count on it though.

If they won't help, return the game & card to GameCrazy (and don't take 
no for an answer)

Return the game. Don't take no for an answer. Get store credit if you 
feel like being gracious. If you got hosed its your own fault. There is 
no way a business should be selling used titles that can not be played 
without full disclosure.
