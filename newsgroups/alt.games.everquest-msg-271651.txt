Pretty much off topic but if you want a LOT of landscape, try EQ.  The folks 
in Antonica were debating this the other night, but EQ2 simply isn't as big 
as EQ was at its release (and EQ has subsequently added a lot more room).

I'm not saying EQ is better by any means, but it's certainly larger.  Sony 
made some DEFINITE improvements in EQ2 that many will think more than makes 
up for the fact that it only takes about 10 mins (ok, didn't time it...might 
be 7 or might be 15) to run across the zone (less time than West Karanas in 
EQ, I'm betting).  I'm going to guess that Commonlands is the same.  In EQ 
it takes about 45 minutes to run from one end of the game to the other (much 
longer if you take the boats...assuming they're back in the game this week 
:) ).
