   The enchanter will turn into a giant pile of shit. 
Really.  Its worth creating a enchanter just to do this
little stunt at least once.
   Here's a question about even more fun one can have with
this effect.  Say an enchanter turns into the giant pile of
shit, then his wife duels him and kills him.  Then the wife
brings up her necromancer, the now naked enchanter runs over
to, oh, say, the entrance to the EComms tunnel.  Wifey-poo
(heh) fires off her new summon corpse spell.  Is there now a
giant pile of shit blocking the entrance to the tunnel?  And
if so, will there be repercussions to deal with from the
fine folks in Verant's on-line customer service department?
