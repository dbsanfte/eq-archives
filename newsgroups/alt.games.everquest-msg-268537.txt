I asked this before and since then have had a hard disk crash. :P

Can anyone recommend the next step up? I'm finding the lag really bad. I
have a gig ram, p4 - 3000. Also i find i have to reboot after playing eq2
for a while; it seems to do something weird to the colour balance (something
to do with gamma?). Either that, or the card or the monitor (nooo!) is
burning out.

Eski 13 brawler, 12 outfitter, still to make one decent backpack.
