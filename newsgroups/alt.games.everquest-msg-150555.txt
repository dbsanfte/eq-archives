Good grief.  Outside of manaburn and AoE the wizard has honestly been
nothing but an XP drain for any serious group for many months now.  The
wizzy was broken a LONG time ago through neglect.  The dps for a wizzy is so
low it's sickening.  When you consider that a wizzy brings virtually nothing
to a group other then damage and is about the purest damage class in the
game it makes one wonder why most of melee can easily outdamage them.  Melle
also absorbs damage so why on earth should they also excel in dps?!

Honestly, to all you people STILL playing a wizzy after all this time you've
done nothing but help perpetuate the gimpy and lame class.  Why would VI/SOE
fix a class that's still being played?  Many of you even try to argue that
the class is viable when it's OBVIOUS that sitting on your arse and medding
most the time makes the class worthless.  For those of you still at low
levels thinking that after you get Ice Comet things will change you can be
excused - you're wrong but since you're not there yet it's understandable.
I stoped playing mine when I hit 53 and realized that virtually every single
character in my guild near my level made me look weak and pathetic.  AoE
groups (like 5% of the game maybe) and now manaburn are about the only thing
the class is of any value for and manaburn NEEDS to be nerfed - it insain!

The next thing for the wizzy is for it to become a "toy" class for people
already with 1 or more level 60 characters.  They will powerlevel one up
just to do manaburns and VI/SOE will be able to point at all the people
"playing" wizards and claim that the class is well and healthy.

EQ sucks so bad in the upper end game it's amazing and all you folks are
like zombies and keep tossing your money at VI/SOE hoping that someday
you'll get the character you always wanted.  If you haven't figured out yet
to "follow the money trail" then I suspect you never will.  You'll NEVER get
the character you want.  VI/SOE will always put another carrot on a stick in
front of you.  You'll NEVER be reallt satisfied with your character
especially if you have a wizzy.

To be honest, I guess I rather hope you wussies keep chasing that EverCrack
dream so you stay off the new and getter games out there.  But if you insist
on a new game, if you eventually DO figure out the truth about the money
hugrey VI/SOE game please go over to EQ2 or even SWG.  I'm sure you'll feel
right at home.

Good grief....
