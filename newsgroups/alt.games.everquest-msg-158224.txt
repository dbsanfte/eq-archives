I'm too am dumb & I got no life just like everyone else in this poll, i
would definatly continue playing. Infact on a regular basis i delete my
chars so i got no chars above level 10.
I think most of my items are overpowered and should be nerfed anyway, like
my Rusty Dagger. If i play caster, i never learn a spell, coz thats too
imbalancing and all spells should be nerfed.
Infact, VI should nerf everything so that there are no items, no spells, and
no damn XP, everyone should be level 1 anyway. We should just hand
Verant/Sony our money on a monthly basis without demanding! We demand too
much! We should pay more too.
