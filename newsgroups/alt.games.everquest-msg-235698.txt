I am a newbie and starting off with several characters to try out. So I 
will post about each class here asking for ideas about best race to play 
for a given class, or at least the pros and cons of the available 
choices... Right now I am on Stromm but posted here for feedback on the 
new server.

My cleric is probably going to be my main character I play out of a 
Beastlord, Ranger, Druid and Cleric that I have rolled. I decided to go 
with a Froglok for my cleric. I like how they look and animate. Yes, I 
know that is the subject of some debate but I think they are very cool. 
Mine is blue too!

It seemed like the Froglok would be a very good choice for cleric with 
his high agility and dexterity. I know he isn't as wise as a High Elf or 
Erudite but I think he'd hold up better under pressure due to being 
harder to hit and having a bit more stamina too. Passing on the high 
wisdom of the other choices was kind of tough but I'm thinking the 
Froglok is a good race for a cleric.

What do you guys think? I haven't seen that much posted about Froggies 
(am new here but have been reading and posting on TNZ for a bit). I've 
read they have a great starting area and good newbie quests too, which 
is very appealing to me as a newbie.
