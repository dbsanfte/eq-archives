It seems we are seeing a repeat of the trend in EQ1 when LoY came out
in EQ2 now: Frog hate. The lady went and ran the quest to unlock
Frogloks on her account the other day and rolled one up. After several
hours of playing, she just logged off. People flat-out refusing to
group with her, making snide and outright obscene remarks, and so
forth. Fortunately training isn't as easy as it was in EQ1, so this
isn't as common a problem...

But the point is, it's absolutely pathetic that people are putting so
much hate into something so trivial. What is the purpose to being so
abusive toward other players simply for the race they choose to play?
And don't tell me they're "roleplaying", this goes WAY beyond what
"RP" excuses.
