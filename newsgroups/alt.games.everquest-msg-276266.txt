I just don't understand it. I realize there are a hell of a lot of young kids 
whose rich [ or not ] parents will cough up whatever Johnny wants, as a 
substitute for parenting, but anyone else of puberty or older paying out of 
their own pocket ? Nope, baffles me.

What possible pleasure could one derive from from _buying_ as opposed 
to _earning_ ? It's as repulsive to me as Smart buying his mail order PHD and 
then claiming to be legit. Sickening really.
