As a duo you can do many of the pieces, and you should have a lot of
fun doing it. The quests will take you to many places throughout the
old world. As a duo you won't be able to finish some of the pieces
until close to your 40s. Some of the quest drops you will need are
insanely rare. The totemic helm and breastplate quests are extremely
hard to complete due to the rareness of the creatures that drop items
you need. The biggest downside to the quests is that you will spend
more pp on the gems than it will cost to buy the completed pieces in
the bazaar (Dufrenite for Shaman Armor is something like 180pp per
piece).

Don't worry about your epics until you get close to level 50 and have
enough friends (or a guild) to put together 2-3 groups. Epics are not
easy...otherwise they wouldn't be "epic"  :-P.
