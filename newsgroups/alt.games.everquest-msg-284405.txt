Yup. Been that way on both my last two ATI cards - latest of which is an 
X800XT AIW. You should be able to go into your graphics options and just 
nudge the gamma slider to make it go back to normal. Annoying as all get 
out.

I have, however, found that if I play in windowed mode (while still filling 
very nearly the entire desktop), I have access to outside programs without 
having to worry about it. It sure beats the hassle otherwise.
