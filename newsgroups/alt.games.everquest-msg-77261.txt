I never had that much trouble getting my Erudin Necro welcome in
Qeynos (most places), HH, and Freeport (again most places).  Could
even bank in Freeport.  I did have to kill many Gnolls and Bandits
for Qeynos and HH, but got XP for nearly all of it.  Turned in the
bandit sashes in Qeynos and the Paladins loved me. Had to hand them
in invis and never had the guy aggro on me in the process.

Once I got him into his 40's I went completely evil though and am
now KOS in almost all of those places again. Still can bank in
Freeport though.  To handy to lose.
