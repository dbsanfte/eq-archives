There is a cheesy way to grab a single add away from a stacked pair
of mobs (I do not suggest doing this if you have more than one add).

Clear your targetting (esc), back up and sit.  The add won't have
been touched yet and will beeline for you, hit you and be targetted.

I use this to seperate and pet-tank adds in a single overpull.
