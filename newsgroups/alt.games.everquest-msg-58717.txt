Considering smugglers to still be citizens, or at least not
suitable for hunting down and slaying, doesn't necessarily make
the Highpass guards corrupt. But the smugglers themselves are
KoS?

I must admit the `corrupt' faction in Queynos and Freeport being
connected by them comes as more of a surprise. Doesn't really seem
to make much sense either. But then, as I mentioned with the belt
quest, the factions in the cities seem rather overly tangled.

Heh, I was with a group hunting orcs in GFay (and having reason
enough to hate them) when I went swooping down at a hugely red
fairy guard. The whole group screaming "no!", "don't!", "not
that". Silly people, I just wanted to have a closer look (they're
really cute), listen to the sounds and give it a hug. People
have the strangest idea's.

Still, I didn't realise there were dead froglok's I could go
and kick around. I'll have to explore the region when i'm a
bit higher level.
