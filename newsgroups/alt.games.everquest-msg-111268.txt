  If you have it set so a percentage of your experience is getting dumped
into AAXP points, and you are resurrected, does the percentage of the
experience gained get dumped in the AAXP pool, or does it all go back into
your leveling pool?  I'm thinking of stalling my advancement once I hit 52
so my guildmates and I can hit the Antonica dragons a few times, and it
would be nice to be able to gain a few AAXP points in the meantime.

  Thanks.
