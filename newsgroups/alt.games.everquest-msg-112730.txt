Ghetto porting.

It's also a great way to regain mana and hp.  With pre-10 characters you
fight until you're low enough on hp/mana that it will take longer to regain
them then it will to simply die and respawn.  My latest character (wizard)
would fight until she was OOM, whack a guard, and respawn with FM.  The
first 10 levels are really a complete and utter joke now, IMO.
