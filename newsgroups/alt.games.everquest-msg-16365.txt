I am a newbie with 4 characters lvl 5 or less and I would like to say
I think you have missed the point here.

I think I can safely say probably nobody has had more help both in
the game and in this newsgroup than I have but there is no doubt there
are newbies out there nobody would miss including me!

I have had no problems just using common courtesy and a little common 
sense.  Sure there a lots of things I still do`nt know, for intance
I have a shaman and a druid and know zilch about grouping but that
wo`nt be a problem with a little research and application ( I hope! :-) )
