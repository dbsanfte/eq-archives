Turning molars in in Paineel will lower Erudin Faction.

Turning molars in in Erudin will lower Paineel Faction

Killing Kobolds raises both factions.

Paineel is tricky, because you need a (nodrop) key to get in. To get a
key you need to be amiable to the guards in the newbie area, or have a
player with a key let you in. The nice thing about Paineel is that
there is just 1 faction for the entire city (Heretics). With the Druid
ring and Nexus spire so close, you can blow off Erudin faction and
concentrate on being able to buy/sell/bank in Paineel.

Kill a TON of Kobolds, and you will raise faction with both cities.
Once you get to at least Dubious you can go anywhere in Paineel, and
most places in Erudin (don't go into the tower or wander too close to
the Paladin/Cleric guilds).
