That changes some at higher levels where a druid is less likely to be
a main healer.

I think all the really good healers, cleric or druid, have that
attitude. Shaman gets a bit more complicated.

Speak up when you first enter a group. Especially at lower levels, let
people know that it's your highest level character and that you really
do need the cash. At leats on Bristlebane, which is an old server,
tanks will often loot just to clear out the corpses and casters have
to be prodded to get up and loot occasionally.  

Having run a serious twink warrior up to 40th lvl recently, mainly
pickup groups to avoid the boredom of soloing, I was surprised how
often someone that wasn't a twink was told to just loot everything.
