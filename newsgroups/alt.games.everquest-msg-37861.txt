That would not have been considered proof either.

I will read between the lines for you.

He wanted to prove to himself that is wasn't a fluke. He knew no amount of
proof would be satisfactory.

The extra time to get a screen shot and post it on a web site would have
just been more wasted time.

You never want to get into the habit of letting other people on the internet
set the bar for your proof, it is a sub game. Ends up becoming "I took a
screen shot and had it signed by a notary public" is counter with "You
didn't give their licence" which is followed by "How do I know they really
signed if vs Photoshop" ad infinitum.

Besides, this defines the pointless newsgroup rant.

Let's look at the resolution. If you believe one side, you must put a point
in taunt. If you believe the other side, you mearly have to play for 6
hours, gaining levels the entire time, before you get a single gain from
0-1.

Are you going to start a taunt type character and *not* put a point into
taunt so you can wait 7 levels to see your first gain? Pointless. Could
Mighty Mouse defeat Superman? Could you open pit copper mine using spoons
and plastic pails?
