Talking about which, have the recent changes made fishing harvested items
and other such food drink raw materials actually sellable? I saw antonican
coffee for sale at 100 * the price pre-patch, which made me wince. I am

players yields little more than the price to the npc vendor so far, and I'm
level 17 scholar :P
