Not sure on the specifics, and not that bothered, what I do know is that a
mage charmed pet in BoT courtyard (stormriders) netted more exp than doing
without, we cleared every mob except the centre gargoyles, was a high dps
group (ranger tanking (me), mage, wiz, chanter, cleric).

Think it was about 6 aa in 7 hours or something similar.
