Over the eliminaton of the single largest crutch known to Norrath?! If the 
game is so terrible without it, why would you play in the first place? 
Personally, I don't care if people get KEI or not. I enjoy it myself from 
time to time, rarely going out of my way for it. However, to consider it a 
necessity to even enjoy the game is just plain lunacy.

A tsi tsi fly just called. They want their attention span back.
