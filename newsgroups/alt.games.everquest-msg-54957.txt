get there ?ive taken the barge to the island in timorous deep.ive walked up
to the docks(camouflaged)  but there was an ogre raider there (red to
me).how long is the wait?i guess i need a good idea what to expect and what
i should do,and even where to go.ohh and also how do i get off the
island.....hmmm a port would solve all these questions wouldn't it.although
