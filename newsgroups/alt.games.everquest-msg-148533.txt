Credit where credit is due, Dan helped out with a portion of those tests
too. It was fun. But yes, we had the right combination of characters
available to test both factors independently of each other on everything
but the Iksar.  Swim skill determines your speed, and *marginally* your
maneuverability at very high levels. Stamina, and stamina alone
determines how long you can hold your breath before you begin to drown
unless you are an Iksar. They can hold their breath an insanely long
time right from level one and barebones stats. Was unable to test
if/when it increased for them as they were geared up better with higher
STA and such.
