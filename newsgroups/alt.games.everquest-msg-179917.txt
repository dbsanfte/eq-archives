The game is on its last leg.  Star Wars Galaxies will be out by summer and
Everquest Two by years end.  There is no compelling reason to continue to
play except to keep alive the relationships that have been developed in the
game.  I signed off 4 months ago.  If you go to Everquest's website you will
see that they no longer show the number of players online.  Their
subscriptions are on the downward track.  Look for it to go even lower when
Star Wars comes out and once Everquest Two is out, this puppy will pretty
much be finished.  I just hope that after the last GM signs off and the last
server goes black, SONY will decide to release Everquest, the Home Version.
This probably has the same chance as a snowball in you know where but it is
a hope I have.

But getting back to your criticism of the game I think the changes that were
made to transportation were good ones.  Waiting on the boat and having to
ride it was plain boring.  If content had been added where things could be
happening while you were onboard then it would have been more realistic.
Also, the Druid Taxi Cab was never something I liked.  I knew people who
only ran Druids to make cash on ports.  This in and of itself was a serious
"Class Balancing" problem.  Should a Druid really be able to make 200PP for
providing some Uber Twinked character a port from Butcherblock to NK?

I like the change they made to meditating.  Why would someone have to stare
at a spellbook and not be aware of what was around them.  I think the game
should not have required Clerics, Necromancers, Paladins, and ShadowKnights
to carry spellbooks.  Since the whole premise behind Clerics and Paladins is
that their gods give them their spells then they should have automatically
gained access to new level spells.  Maybe some of the spells in the 50s
should require them to perform tasks for their gods.  Having something like
that in the game would have been really cool.
