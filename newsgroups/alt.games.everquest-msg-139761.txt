Thanks for the insights, Matt, and to others who have written and confirmed
more or less my suspicions about Vox's increased spell usage.  You are right
that the Naggy and Vox open raids are pretty much Zerg-fests, though some of
the leaders will send groups into the fray in waves. MA tactics I have never
seen used on Vox, and only once on Nagafen. On Naggy, it wasn't set up very
well, the cleric was summoned and eaten, the leader freaked and yelled
'charge', and we all made corpse mosaics in Naggy's cave. I'd like to copy
your suggestions to our message board, and see if any good discussion will
come of it.
