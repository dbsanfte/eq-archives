You are correct, sir.

You don't remember wrong, but I'd hazard to say that the source you
remember was quite possibly not right. Not that the verse wasn't
possibly mistranslated, but that there is no clear consensus as to
what the correct translation might be.

There seems to be a LOT of confusion about this issue. Do a bit of
research on the net and you'll find all kinds of translations (many of
which are no better), including completely different "what the word in
Hebrew *really* means is..." claims.

The original meaning, whatever it was, is irrelevant. It says what it
says *now*, and people are waving it around claiming it's the true
word of god.
