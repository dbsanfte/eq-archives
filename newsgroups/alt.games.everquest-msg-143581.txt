While I'll grant you thats a positive change, it really only affects
clever low level poor people, and hard working trade skillers,
for the average joe spider silks generally haven't been worth
the time to farm stackable or not.  And when they weren't stackable
and I did care, all I had to do was carry a sewing kit, and combine
the silks into swatches, which have always stacked.

The recent introduction of the Solstice Earring quest has
raised the price on spider silks thru the roof, such that
I was happily spending my time killing the EK spiders for
days... and despite the fact that I was using my 35 bard
to do it, since he wasn't getting any exp, thats time I could
have spent doing somethign worthwhile with my then 59 cleric.
If you want to talk about spider silks, I say the seminal
moment for them was not becoming stackable, but becoming
"high demand" with the POTC quest.

If I had to pick a post velious seminal moment, I'd be torn
between SOL release, with the Nexus making the old
world (and later Velious) far mroe accessible to the non
porting classes, or the Bazaar, which makes both
buying and selling a hundred times better for 99% of
items.  Too bad they don't have a feature there to "vend"
services such as buffs (100pp to cast KEI, step right up)
or MQ's or containers.
