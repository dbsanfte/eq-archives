Two ways of doing it, Level hard and fast, make do with what money you make
and equipment you loot until you are raid level then raid hard and the loot
will come, see Jazzmd for good example. Or, take your time, hunt the low exp
high return areas, trade a bit (waste time in EC Bazaar) and keep on like
this, make the money and let the levels come as they will. Difference? Jazz
is 54th in about a year I am 51st in 2 years...I'd wager I still have the
better equipment but that won't last, Jazz's raiding will get items I will
not be able buy (no drop) or just down right too expensive for me to buy.

I'd say try and make a compromise, don't do what I did but do remember to
stop and take a good look at what you have in your inventory and see if
maybe you should get rid of thoses raw hide bracers :ï¿½)
