There's nothing that you *need* to save and copy to your new computer, 
since your characters and their cash/items are all stored on Verant's 
servers, not on your computer. 

However, as Tipot said, it is a good idea to copy all files in your EQ 
directory with your character's names in them (charactername_65.opt and 
charactername_65.ini) so that all of your hotkeys and friend lists will 
still be there when you switch systems. Also, copy eqclient.ini as well.
