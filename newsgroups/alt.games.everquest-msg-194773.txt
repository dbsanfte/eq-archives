Can think of only one dropped magic weapon accessible to extreme
lowbies (see below), but there are some summonned weapons and quite
a few quested weapons:

Cleric can summon a nodrop magic hammer at L9.
Paladin can summon a nodrop magic hammer at L15.
Not sure what level Magician can summon decent weapon.
Barb (?and Vah Shir?) Shaman can do quest for item to summon
magic hammer (dunno if charged, or how many charges if so).
Any non-evil can do the Shining Star of Light quest, L8 Enchanter
can do it without faction work (faction is easy tho, just give
some band-aids to a halfling), the SSoL is a Cleric/Paladin only
magic mace.
Many class/race combinations have weapon quests that go with the
newbie armor quests, there is a good rundown of the armor and
weapon quests on eqtraders.  Of course, there is at least one of
these quests (Karana Paladin, S Qeynos) that requires you to
kill willowisps to complete it (yay SOE!).

Oh yeah, the dropped magic weapon is a weak piercer with a weak
DoT proc (cool effect tho) that is an uncommon (but not rare) drop
off of Burynaibane Spiders, which are an uncommon spawn in Field
of Bone bonecrawler nest (little underground part of the outdoor
zone where lots of bowncrawler spiderlings spawn).  See EQ Atlas
map, I'm sure you can figure it out.  nb: the piercer is Paladin
usable, one of the few one-handed piercers that are.

Once you are high enough to fight in HHP (mid- to upper-teens)
there are a couple magic weapons that drop there (Polished Granite
Tomahawk and Shiny Brass Halberd).  Also, Ambassador D'Vinn still
drops the Dragoon Dirk occasionally in Crushbone.  And the "new"
ghost in Unrest (Toklar?) drops a weak magic weapon, of course
I'm pretty sure he takes magic to hit, and besides he's a massive
undercon (you'd think he was a DE).

http://everquest.allakhazam.com is a decent source for quest info.
