you have six of those -claws- or six fangs?


Captains Alim, the beastlord trainer, asks for claws, apparantly will
"enchance" a number of different weapons for different claw sets,
but I haven't seen any claws drop except the ones off the lesser shades.

3 darkpaw fangs and a wooden practice flail I bought in town did
nothing.  Either he really doesn't -mean- the teeth, or he means
some other practice flail.

Four shade claws to Kaza Raj gets you AC 5 HP 10 boots,
4 Claw Beast fangs to the same guy gets you AC 8 HP 10 pants...
so -someone- is differentiating between claws and fangs.
