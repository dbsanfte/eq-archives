And here is the major flaw in your argument - Sony never called them
"Epic" weapons.  In fact, they made a point to *not* call them epic 
weapons.  They are class specific particle effect weapons that are the
result of an epic quest.  See 4a.

The problem I have with the new Ber*S*erker epic is that it appears to
be a bit skewed R. vs. R.  

Yeah, I know a time enabled group wiped on the imp in fear, but I also
know that a 4 group raid of sub-elemental people triggered it by accident
and took it down with no preparation.

With that sort of reward, there should be battles in GoD zones against
700-800 hitter mobs that require a raid to get to.
