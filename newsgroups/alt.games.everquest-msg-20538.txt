First of all, I am not asking for a war of words with you or anyone. If you
wanna debate, fine, I'm up for it.

Vacuum Cleaner doesn't fit the fantasy role-play. Pretty well how I read it.
I agree with you whole heartedly on the rules.

1 Vacuum Cleaner IS apparently a violation. I stand Corrected
2 This game has a high level of fantasy role-play. I agree

3 A name choice gives a person the right to call someone an Idiot.
I disagree totally, do you agree ?

 Its simple to me. I know your intelligent despite my flames at you in the
beginning. But the defense of anyone who is a "Name caller" confuses me to
no end.

Ebay's should be banned
Name Callers should be Banned
and
The NG should abide by the same rules as the game (Bizbee) and refrain from
justifying their lack communicating skills by saying "Kids shouldn't be on
EQ" as opposed to just cleaning up their nasty mouths.

 My opinions, and I am not here to change anyone's mind. But it seems the
ones who jumped in the Ebay thread, must have had something to hide.

Now

Try and have a nice day :-)

Apologies if I insulted anyone personally. I felt strong about what I said.
