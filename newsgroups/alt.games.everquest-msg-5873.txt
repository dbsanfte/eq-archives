The Knights of Truth seem to be mostly referred to as being in N.
Freeport, while references to the Militia seem to be in East and West.
Having never played an evil character before, I never paid them much
attention or bothered conning them all.  Is it a strict zone division?
I mean, if I restrict my travel to only E. and W. Freeport, am I safe
from running into guards who are on the K.o.T faction?  I may have need
to get to the docks shortly coming from the N. Ro direction, and was
hoping that being dubious with the Militia would let me zone into E.
Freeport, run in the gate and dash round the corner to the piers.  Any
chance I'll hit a K.o.T faction guard on the way? Or perhaps another one
of those bastardly Antonican Bards or other KOS to a troll NPC's?
