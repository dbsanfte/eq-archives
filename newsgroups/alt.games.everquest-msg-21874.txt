So right.  I usually hunt in Everfrost, and I often hunt alone.  My current
xp sweetheart is the Orc Shaman.  The trouble is that they're so seldom
alone. I've on more than one occasion been smacked around by a pair or even
a trio of shamans, more than one of which I definitely cannot handle.

The other day I was a third of the way through a shaman, and things were
going well.  That's when another shaman jogged over a hill to save its
buddy.  Rather than run like hell, which was the right decision, I got
nervous and started to hype myself up: "I can win this, I can win this, I'll
blind the second one and beat down the first while #2 runs around!"  Yeah,
right.  Odds of getting Flash off while being whupped like that?  Not good.
Odds of it being resisted if I did get it off?  Damned good.

I ignored this logic and blew three or four Flashes anyway.  Only one
completed and it was resisted.  Things were going bad and I was down to
about a third of my health.  Now, instead of running (again!), I started
hyping myself again: "The first one will run away if I can just hit it twice
more! I'll get it panicked and then I'll only have to run from one of them!"
Yeah, right.  It was actually true, but the God of Dice sends several flubs
my way whenever I start to think like that.

I swung and missed.  I swung and missed again.  Then, just for good measure,
I swung and missed a third and fourth time.  Meanwhile, I'd taken a couple
of those 75dmg frost spells in the face and dropped down to one bubble of
health.  This occasionally activates my Panic And Run In Random Direction
skill, and that's exactly what happened.  The final self-hype, the worst one
I personally ever get, kicked in: "I can still make it to the guards! I know
the way back!"

At that precise moment I was stun-spun.  Heedless of this and still
convinced I knew the way, I corrected course (I thought) and ran on,
ignoring the fact that the terrain I was seeing wasn't what it should have
been.  I had to make it to the guards, I had no time for trifles like
landmarks.

Of course, thirty seconds later I had slowed from a run to a brisk walk, and
a few seconds after that a leisurely stroll. Just as I slowed to that
dragging near-death crawl (the one I call the Oh-Shit Shuffle), the zone
wall rendered in.  "At last!" I thought, relief flooding through me.  I took
another frost slam in the butt, but I hardly noticed.  I was safe!  No way
could I not make it now!  I'd run into the gap and.....wait a minute?  Where
was the gap??

I stopped.  I looked left.  I got blasted again.  I looked right.  No niche,
no guards, no idea of which way to go.  All right then!  Since I couldn't
live like a coward I would die like a hero!  I turned, rather hopelessly,
and noticed that someone I hadn't seen had attracted the second orc away
from me, leaving only the one I'd nearly crippled.  It had regenerated
enough that I knew I couldn't kill it before my meager health expired, but I
gritted my teeth and put one more solid hit on the orc before he knocked me
down.

Right about when my view changed to the overhead "you are unconscious"
angle, I remembered I hadn't used Lay On Hands.

I later put my head in my hands and sighed.  First I watched my inert body
being stomped rather mercilessly but, I had to admit, deservedly.
