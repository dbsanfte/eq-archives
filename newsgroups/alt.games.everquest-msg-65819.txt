I doubt more horsepower will inprove it. Its just siting there sending data
to and from the server (not very fast). Seems the server is the one makin
things slow.
All that time, you are just siting there too (my friend regeained almost a
bulb of health between zoning), so I guess now a port to skyfire is taking a
big risk of being turned to mincemeat before you get control. Ditto catching
the boat to OT with the idea of jumping off etc etc etc etc.

If anyone wants to buy a port now, they can come up with 50p to cover the
time, and forget all about wind of the North. Of course verant could have
avoided this problem ahead of time by not putting the skyfire ports in such
an idiotic positions. Didnt matter while they were screwing 10% of the
players (those who zone slowly). Now it can bite 100% of players, its come
back to haunt them.
