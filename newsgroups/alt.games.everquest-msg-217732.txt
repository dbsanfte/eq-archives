I like playing on one, its easier than two. 

You don't really need a powerful machine at all. I do it with
EQwindows (www.eqwindows.com), two everquest folders and two eq
windows folders. I turn the sound off in one eq folder, run both in
1024 x768, all old models, velious textures enabled, Low textures,
texture cache and direct 3d texture compression, clipping around 5
percent most of the time.

This is on a celeron 1.8 ghz, 768 meg of pci 133 sdram (was WAY
cheaper than ddr at the time), xp pro, geforce 4 ti 4200 128 meg.
768 meg seems about right, cacheman shows that with both of them up
I'll use as much as 699 meg of system ram sometimes and about 30 meg
of virtual swap at the most.

It works quite well. I switch from instance to instance with the touch
of a hotkey, two boxing a 42 or so SK troll and a 43 dark elf cleric.
To a stranger, it would appear that two different people were playing.
I think this is much easier than using two computers since you'd have
to be jumping from keyboard/mouse to other keyboard mouse.

I never crash, ever. I'm not careful in starting up either, I start up
on eqwindows and when that character is in game I start up the other
one.

It seems to be best with a healer type and someone else, since the
cleric mostly sits then I switch back to it to heal the sk.

The comp switches from character to character instantaneously with
eqwindows, it is quite seamless. Its so good that when I'm in a hurry
I might forget which character I'm on, except I'm in third person from
behind and the troll is a big fatty.
