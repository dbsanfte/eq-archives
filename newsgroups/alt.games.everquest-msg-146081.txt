So only a cleric can actually turn in the shards, true? And for that
matter, only a cleric who has the pearl.

hrmm... I'm wondering, if none of my guild's clerics are ready for it,
and none of my friends are, and "stranger" clerics are in the zone
hunting them..

What sort of a highjacking deal could I make when shards do drop? Hrmmm.

Well, enough of that. I'd better get home. I need to get ready to take
Team Necro there and set up their lawn chairs, stock up the cooler with
Chateau Le Gimp 96 and set the glasses to chilling. Then I'll just be
pulling all night.

/sigh
