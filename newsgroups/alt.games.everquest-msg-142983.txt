But even then, the excuse often given by the kill stealer is "I didn't
know". This suggestion would kill that particular lameness.

Besides which, there is a lot of unintentional kill stealing. In the

countless times. Something like this would have saved me the mistake,
and the subsequent ill will from people who thought it was
intentional.
