-- Thanks, your posting confirms my decision to forgo SWG, at least
for awhile.
Esp the lack of exciting content for a combat character. If I do SWG,
I would want to build up to a Bounty Hunter or Jedi but it sounds like
the game isn't ready for that yet. I've gotten back into EQ and
enjoying it, I think my money would be better spent on the EQ
expansions I don't have yet.
