To you bards attempting swarm kiting:

The key thing to remember is that bards can "cast" while they are
running, so you can be charming or re-charming a mob as you are
running it and its buddys
in circles.

The 27 charm song actually works really well for swarm kiting.  I used
it quite a lot in Great Divide, before they changed the 39 song's
duration (from 3 ticks to 10) and upped its mana cost.  27 charm
required no mana, so was preferable at the time until the giants I
wanted to charm were too high to be affected by it.

There is an advantage to it only lasting 3 ticks - your pet probably
won't die before charm breaks!  So you don't need to worry about
breaking charm yourself via invis.  Charm the mob several times,
having it attack till it gets down to  about 10 - 20% health, then run
it in circles twisting bellow and 30 fufil's if  you have it, till
it's dead.  The rinse and repeat.  The entire time you are  running in
circles avoiding and/or steering mobs that aren't attacking your pet, 
onto your pet.

Until you have 49 selo's accelerating chorus, I highly recommend swarm
kiting with SoW.   It's much safer and reduces your multi-tasking load
a little.

There are a ton of tricks to making swarm kiting easier, safer and
more efficient, roughly in this order of priority (according to me) :)

0) Only swarm mobs that a) are social, b) don't cast.
1) Use 3rd person view - highly recommended (hit F9 four times, then
adjust the camera angle)
2) Have hot keys for the songs you are using:
   /stopsong
   /cast <n>
3) Use the "Tab buffer" to memorize your pet, and be able to recall
him if you
   lose him accidentally (early charm break)
4) Use "toggle targets" to keep track of both your pet and its
target's health
5) Use an instant invis item for breaking charm (goblin gazhugi ring
is the best till level 51)
6) If your pet has fewer than three mobs beating on it, twist in DoTs
or DD songs to the target till charm breaks.
7) After killing the pet, charm the target it was fighting.  You can
switch to it using toggle targets.
8) Have 51 Song of Travel mem'd so that you can jet invised to the
zone line once you run out of mana.
9) Have mez song memmed so that you can mez a target when you are down
to one target remaining.  Mez him and loot all the corpses laying
around.  (Mez doesn't work on giants!)
10) Find swarming areas where you won't get inadvertant adds.  But
remember that adds of the same type of mob are usually GOOD!  They
help you beat your pet down faster.
