    Even without Torpor, have a little contest some day. Find a cleric at
your level, roughly the same mana pool, get all the mana regen helping buffs
you want up. Cast until you're both OOM, then see who can get to FM/FH
first. Do that with a bunch of casters if you like. The shaman can recover
mana at an incredible rate. Torpor just makes the recovery not depend on the
shaman's regen rate, and if you're "waiting on the shaman" then small heals
mean the shaman doesn't need to depend on his regen rate either.
