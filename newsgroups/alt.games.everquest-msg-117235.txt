HAAHAHAH... well said Freek!  Don't forget to mention how, as your levels
get higher and higher, you must group more and therefore split XP from harder 
and harder to kill mobs, thereby causing you to level slower and slower.  The
main goal of EQ is to get you to pay $13 a month for as long as possible, and
I must admit, Verant has done a pretty good job of it.

Personally, this ultra-slow level-grind has gotten me to go out and buy a 
couple new games (Morrowind, Dungeon Siege) since I can only stand a fairly
short period of playing EQ at once.  I still enjoy EQ, but frankly, killing
300+ of the same mob *per level* in DL has gotten real old.
