Ouch. Also, it might not be her kind of game and EQ just happens to be
my kind of game, so it wasn't really a chore to take up playing it.
Heck, if I am levitated and sitting still over a longer period of
time, I sometimes almost get motion sickness myself and open my spell
book to get something stable to look at :)

The job I almost got entailed maintaining a chemical etc. database for
a pharmaceutical company. I would have loved doing that.
I should probably just teach myself java and such and apply to be a
web designer... I didn't do enough of the right kind of mucking around
with computers to get an IT job.

Yeah, seen a couple of them. The worst one is the one that rolls on my
TV screen at night - I have it on to listen to music and people are
paying roughly a dollar per message to chat on the tv screen when they
could spout ten times as much bullcrap for the same price on the
teletext channels. SMS chats are definitely not my thing. (And the
slang they use? *shudder*)

Go ahead. I won't tell anyone :)

Lindesnes? That's where I almost got that job.

Hey, my halfling pallymule is CUTE!
And, I rolled up a human druid that you shouldn't really expect to see
around, but if you should ever come across a Kelaino, that'll be me.

*snicker*
Most halfling druids are obnoxious, but I actually know three decent
specimens.

Not really. I can think of maybe half a dozen that *might* carry the
game, and the store where I bought the orginal+Kunark shut down some
time ago (I got Velious and Luclin from friends)
I know there is one net cafe in Hgsd, but haven't been inside it.
Don't know if it's gamer friendly but do know it costs quite a bit.
