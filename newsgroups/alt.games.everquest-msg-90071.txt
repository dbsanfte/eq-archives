I imagine you're comparing the graphics with say Camelot or Anarchy Online.
They don't compare, its true.

But nor does the content. AO is a beautiful world totally devoid of content.
Camelot is a superior but monotonous and minute world with no class balance
and nothing but solid treadmill-levelling until the strategic war game that
is RvR.

I've played EQ since May 99, I've also played AC, DAoC and AO (tried UO but
it was laggy and graphically awful). I've taken breaks (two, 6 months at a
time) from EQ to play those games and I've always come back. There's always
something new to try, for example in the past I've always concentrated on
soloing but now I'm playing a cleric and I've grouped more times in the last
couple of months than in the previous couple of years or more, although I
can solo perfectly well if need be.

You can't judge EQ until about level 8, but how well  you take to it will
definitely depend on what you've come from, what you are looking for, what
your machine specs are and how you tweak the game options (graphics at
higher resolutions are much better than at low ones) and which class you
play in relation to what you want to do. They really are all different, from
level 1, unlike some games. You can't really gimp them either.
