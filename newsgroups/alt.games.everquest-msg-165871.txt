Two places come to mind, as far as XP goes, although the loot isn't the
great.

1. Continue in EW.  The Walrus' should all be blue, and I think they are
fairly low on HP for their level.  The Ulthork Men of War will also be blue,
but they are quite a bit tougher.

2. Head over to Ill Omen and slaughter Bloodgil Goblins.
