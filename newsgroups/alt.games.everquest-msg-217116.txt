No matter what cure or uncurse spells you have, this is not something you
should be screwing around with during the mission.   If the group feels like
playing russian roulette with chests, thats fine with me... but it better be
after we have won or lost.   You have a half hour in which to do it, and
it's not like you have to reclear mobs to get back to the chests.
