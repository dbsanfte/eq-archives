Not sure of the price on your server , however a Venomous Axe of the Velium
Brood is really cheap on Vallon ( sub 500p ), and generates a very decent
amount of aggro. If you can afford it a Frostbringer is also a very good
aggro grabing weapon. My little Warrior uses those two weapons, Frostbringer
in main, and has no problems keeping aggro. Granted, she's only 47, but I
would assume that it would scale up to 52 at least to some degree.
