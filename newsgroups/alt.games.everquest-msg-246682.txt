If you're concerned about PC safety and security, then what are you
doing playing Everquest?

Long ago it was brought up with a new policy that every player had to
agree to that allowed the EQ Devs to peek inside our computers whenever
they wanted to.  Just as people did when they found that the newer
Pentium models also allowed Microsoft people to peek into their
computers, they complained about computer security.  The EQ Devs did
not let this issue go to a loss, but they did drop it down to "Oh,
we'll just check your EQ folder, not your whole computer."  From that
point on if you had a firewall on your computer you had to open up
certain ports or else you all EQ stuff would be blocked from your
computer if you tried accessing them.

Every now and again I will go ask that some stuff be changed on the
firewall, and we will look at what is going on inside the firewall.  If
EQ is running we will see a load of spam saying that such and such from
EQ is checking us all every so many seconds.
