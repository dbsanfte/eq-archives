Do you really expect a class in your group to use up potions for invisible
instead of one of the group members casting it on them? This has me
absolutely floored.

Do you also expect all your non-shaman/druid/bst/rangers to carry sow
potions? Does everyone have to have see invisible spell or effect or they're
expected to run along with the group blindly? Do the non porters have to
disband and run to destinations on their own two feet? Should everyone have
lev potions or buy some lev rings before grouping with you? EB items are a
must or maybe there's potions for that also? Melee must have to carry DS
potions if they'd like that extra damage. I guess you don't ever expect
cleric buffs, how about the heals?

Unbelievable.
