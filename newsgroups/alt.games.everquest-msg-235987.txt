I recently started everquest.  I found Groo McManus and was told to find 
a vah shir in shadeweaver thicket.  No name, no information.

I found a character named Kylfa in the beastlord camp and when hailed he 
would ask what I seek.  Since the message from Groo had the phrase "a 
vah shir will have the knowledge you seek" or something very similar I 
thought this male might have been the character I needed to find.

How do I get Kylfa to volunteer information?  He has the [seek] tag, but 
I can't figure out any phrase combination that will get a response out 
of him.  Is he the character I need to find the spirit anchor in Shar 
Vahl (the one Groo sent me to find) or do I need to keep looking?  If 
so, can I have a name and general area where to find the character?

Any help would be appreciated.
