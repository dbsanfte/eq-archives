Seen this behaviour on machines which have DX9c, but not all of the 
required DX9c required files.  Sometimes EQ complains, and other times 
it starts and then just aborts.

Follow the previous advice on installing the full DX9c distribution to 
correct this fault, full details can be found on the Sony technical 
forums and previous posts to this group.
