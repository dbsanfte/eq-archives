Actually I don't think Oregon has an anti-discrimination law re:
sexual orientation in place, but I could be out of date.  If it does
have such a law, I highly doubt it would be "rent to gays first".  In
fact, I doubt you can find any law giving "preferential treatment to
homosexuals".  If you know of one, quote the text of the law, but
don't waste my time with broad statements like the above: we both know
its meaningless rhetoric used to mislead people too lazy- or too
ignorant- to be bothered to look up facts.

Criminal law and your "rights" under the law are different topics,
though in this case related.  The existence of a hate crimes law and
the actual enforcement of it are two different things as well.

While the actual enforcement of the law may vary greatly, you should
blame the law enforcement and judicial system for that, not the laws
themselves.  If a law defines a hate crime (in part) as being one
motivated by sexual orientation, that makes it equally wrong to
gay-bash or straight-bash.

Again your example is more ether than substance.  While you might well
find such an extreme case as your simplistic example, in most
jurisdictions the criteria for hate crime designation are much more
stringent and hate must be demonstrated to be a motivating factor in
the crime.   A recent high-profile case in Toronto demonstrated an
event where the hate crime designation was not used, despite the
surface details.

> There are many more examples but this is sufficient...

Yeah, sufficient to prove you can't back up your claim.  Once again I
invite you to quote an actual law that gives some "minority" a
"special right".  They do exist, but are far more rare than you would
like to think.

Why bother?  The answer is rather moot and has only academic interest.
Let's stick to one argument you can't substantiate before considering
another!
