Gonna grab a quote from below to assist in this response.

Hello.  I've played the game since early 1999, have multiple 65 characters
(including a cleric, a caster and a monk), am in elementals with Time in
sight, and am the lead puller for said elemental level guild.  You don't
know what the fuck you're talking about, like most clerics that think they
know best when it comes to pulling.

Neat how we both get to play that "you don't know what the fuck you're
talking about" game, isn't it?  Of course, I actually do have a 65 cleric. 
Do you have a 65 monk?

By the way, I also have holgresh beads.  :P

And I have something else, knowledge of the availability of camera angles. 
They don't teach that much in cleric school apparently or you would too.

I'll go ahead and sum up the next chunk of this long post to save everybody
time.

If "he may have told you 20m, but that doesn't mean he has 20m" qualifies as
a valid argument, then let me add "he may have said he was only pulling the
next room, but he was actually training the whole rest of the dungeon" as a
great way to counter my arguments.

I'll leave it at that.  "Your cleric may be lying to you" as an argument
pretty much ends any desire I have to argue back.
