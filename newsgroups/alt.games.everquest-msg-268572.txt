I wonder if Sony will ever wakeup and notice that pissing customers
off builts a bad reputation.  After seeing what they did to my
Enchanter in EQ, I refuse to buy EQ2.  I picked up my copy of World of
Warcraft early on the day of release.  They were selling fast.   I
went to 5 stores Friday and there wasn't a copy of WoW to be found.
There were lots of EQ2 games sitting there that nobody wanted.  I
played the WoW beta for a few weeks and so far, I'm really enjoying
the final release of WoW.  It looks like they are very concerned about
keeping their customers happy.  It sure is a change from Sony's take
it or leave it attitude.  Plus, I like the idea that I can solo all
the way to the top level if I feel like it in WoW.  No more sitting
for hours LFG.  How boring.  In EQ2 you HAVE TO GROUP, otherwise,
you're not going anywhere.   I really hated reading the foul mouth
language that many kids used in EQ pick up groups.  No thank you Sony,
I'll stick with WoW for now.
