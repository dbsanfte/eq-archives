I read and replied to this post before I'd actually read the other
replies. It seems Marky-poo exhibits *very* selective memory-recall,
when saying his arguments had allready(sic) been fully prooven(sic) by
others.

Go away and try again, Mark.

This time, take note of the discussions where it's pointed out that a
shaman's ability to slow has nothing whatsoever to do with the
comparison. 

Any other member of the group may be able to slow. It may even be a
group with both a shaman and an SK. The mob is slowed regardless, so
who is able to tank the mob? Which one will have dropped the mob
before the cleric goes OOM trying to keep them alive?

This also wasn't a discussion on *soloing* over *grouping*, it was
(right from the start) a discussion on whether or not the shaman class
was considered a *tank* class. Your assertion that they were *as good
as, if not better, than a pally* is utterly laughable. You haven't
managed a cohesive argument to demonstrate your case and seem only
capable of resorting to childish comments about denial.

Pah. You are a lightweight with poor comprehension skills and even
weaker debating skills.
