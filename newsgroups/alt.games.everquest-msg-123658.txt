Yeap, I lost my 5th coldain prayer shawl that exact way.  Did I ever feel 
like a retard.  Thought I was putting it in a tailor kit to do the sixth 
combine, but I still had the forge open.  I was in absolute shock when I 
walked away from the forge and my tailor kit closed...

Of course, the server GM had -just- left for his two days off, and stayed 
away a third day just so I could sweat some more.  Then he showed up and 
gave it back to me.  By then, of course, I was hunting griffons in EW for 
the durned eggs.
