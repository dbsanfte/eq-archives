Great. Do something touching. Do something moving. Then, move on.
There are four 24 hour general news channels on my cable system. If I
want to watch the ceremonies, they can manage it.

This was a hard enough day to get through without all of the emotional
chain-jerking the media has been pulling every day since 9/11/01.

I started out as a journalism student, got a good look at the
industry, and am glad every day that I dodged that bullet. And, this
was more than ten years ago. The media has gone even further downhill
since.
