I finally got my Robe of Living Fungus (I'm sick to the pit of my
stomach of the Stein of Moggok quest, let me tell you), but it was worth
the money. It goes great with the green eyes and red hair, and with that
and the Icepaw Claws, I'm at last a fairly unique-looking druid. I love
freaking people out by casting SoW on them when they don't expect it. =)

The problem now is that I've begun to lust after a Sarnak Battle Shield
and GE boots, to complement the green of the robe, and god knows that I
*can't* afford those, even if I could contemplate looking at Clurg's
face again.

Bah.
