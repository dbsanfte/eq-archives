Which is why I can't sell spiderling silks for 5pp each anymore...
</grumble>

Prices on the bazaar are interesting to watch.  I'm not an economist, but
I'm getting real life lessons in supply and demand.  A couple of weeks ago,
there weren't many folks selling tailoring supplies in the bazaar on
Karana - went to Everfrost and farmed spiderlings/bears/wolves.  I made
enough plat to buy a full set of crustacean, a FBSS and two lamentations.
At one point, I was able to sell stacks of spiderling silk for 7pp each silk
(140pp the stack).

Word must've got out.  This weekend, I did my now routine hours worth of
farming and set up shop.  Checking prices, I see spiderling silks are now
flooding the market and the average prices is dropping below 2pp each.
Guess I'll be waiting a bit longer on the cobalt gear...

I've thought of coming up w/ a bazaar "Index" like the DJ/NASDAQ - pick a
handful of items, calculate the average price, and aggregate.  It'd be
interesting to see how it would perform over time.
