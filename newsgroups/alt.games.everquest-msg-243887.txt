Well solo there is the pre panic animal, and the post-panic animal phase
of fighting. As soon as you get panic animal as a spell you can fear kite
to your hearts content. Avoid annoying people by driving animals through
camps and aggroing everything. Snare snare and snare some more...practise
all those other skills like taunt and disarm on your own. Make sure
archery is well developed - not so much for its utility but to make sure
its ready for the fancy abilities....

In a group - listen to the group leader if its organised and do what they
say. If its a pickup then either offer to pull (monks will be preferred on
this in many cases) or expect to be main assist. That means wait till the
main fighter/tank has sufficient aggro to hold the mobs attention and then
hit it. Be aware certain of your spells generate hate like there is no
tomorrow, snare and flamelick seem particularly heavy on this front so
while they want the mob snared before it runs its worth leaving it till
there is enough hate going around that casting it won;t cause problems.
The usual problem with rangers is they can readily generate so much hatew
the mobs turn to them. At your level this is frankly not a huge issue with
a decent cleric but can be wasteful on the clerical mana especially if the
cleric is not on clarity of some form. Later it becomes significant and
further along potentially fatal. Be prepared to step back, don't use taunt
in a group situation, often avoid kick and disarm when you get them to
decent levels.
This does make you a VERY useful secondary crowd control/cleric saver
however. Make sure you are very very aware of what is going on. If the
cleric or anyone bleats for help (and they should have a hotkey for just
this purpose) ignore the main mob, turn and leap into the fray with
everything you have - flame lick it, tangling weeds it (both fast spells)
use a proccing weapon if you can, kick it, taunt it most importantly etc
until sucha  point as you pull it off the cleric and someone (maybe
yourself can root it where it can do no harm). Note if you have a chanter
they may NOT want help when being whaled on, especially any help that
includes a DOT on the mob so possibly breaking mez. ASK before you engage
when to help the chanter.
