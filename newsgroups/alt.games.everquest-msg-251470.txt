Hmm. I did a web search yesterday and found that high end PCs can
run faster than 1970s Crays. But this thing was not small and it
wasn't an early model. It was one of the 6 foot high u-shaped ones.

Most of the software on the machines I was console operator for were
written by the people using it. So I have no idea what else was
possible on it. I was refering to speed, but even though you did
software development on Crays, I disagree that a Cray isn't fast
enough to play Everquest on.

How much of the work is done by the PC and how much by Sony's

That I'll agree with.
