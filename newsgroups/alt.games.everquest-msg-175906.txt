     First Off I would like to thank people for the baking suggestions
I got Earlier.  Anyway I am now a level 7 Dark Elf Necromancer. Time
to Get A Pet, I heard the spell leering Corpse Can make you a nice
Skelaton Pet, all you need is bone Chips, Just wondering if this is
true and what else I might need,  So Basically What I would like to
know is how I go about making my new boney friend.   Thanks again in
Advance.

Nightwind.
