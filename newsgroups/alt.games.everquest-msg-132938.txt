The best server for many reasons (except pvp) is Firiona Vie. And it is even
better, if you like to roleplay. And, if you're playing untwinked because
you don't like twinking then it is an even better server (only one char
allowed, which doesn't stop those people with multiple accounts/machines,
unfortunately, but the percentage is low).
