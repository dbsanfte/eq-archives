Wish I missed Episode 1, saw it too many times (3), I guess hoping it would
get better, only parts I enjoyed were the parts with Darth Maul.  Did see it
in Digital Projection though which was cool.
Seriously thinking about skipping Episode 2.  For me Empire Strikes Back
still has the strongest story.  (Sorry for the Star Wars departure, I know
this is the Everquest group.)
