To be fair, Windows actually does need to be patched this often, if not
more so, it just doesn't happen.
If the news item is to be believed (hee), they just fixed a bug
involving pathing in a whopping two zones and an exploit. A single
tradeskill exploit. These two things were so critical to the game they
required immediate patching.
I'm still amused over the news item annoncing the New Years event being
overwritten the next day with the news item stating the new years event
was fixed- without giving any of the information regarding the new
years event the previous days news item gave. So, if you didn't log in
that one day you never saw the details for the New Years event :D Now,
if you haven't logged in for a couple weeks, you just won't know at all
:D Way to go, SOE! Keep up the good work.
