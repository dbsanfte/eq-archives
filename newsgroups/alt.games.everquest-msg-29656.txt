I watched a level 30 druid the other day solo a hill giant in NK,
and later a griffon. Those are ALL tombstone at 30. How the hell
he had the mana and avoided resists to pull that off, I don't
know. I sure as hell wouldn't have considered trying that at 30.

You don't porcupine hill giants, that's for sure...even at level 
44 with ~750 AC and defense 198, they slice through me like butter.
