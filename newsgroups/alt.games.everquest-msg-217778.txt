Given that PoP zones were, by far, the best places to solo for xp for a 
number of classes, from our point of view, it was a solo nerf.  Before 
the change, I could solo for xp faster than I can after the change.  Mind 
you, even after the change, PoP zones are still the best place for me to 
solo for xp, just not as good as they used to be.
