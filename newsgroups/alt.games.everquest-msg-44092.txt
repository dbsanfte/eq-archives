Yes, it functions, but it lacks features to completely support DX7, which
DAoC was written to, and is therefore not *supported*.  Why is it overly
ambitious to write a game to a minimum spec that is so easy to obtain?

I remember the complaints from people over the fact that EQ was going
to require a 3d capable card.  That it was overly ambitious, and was going
to hurt their sales.

The reason I mentioned the MX400 is the fact that they are so easy to
obtain now, but people are using older Geforces just fine.  People are
also using radeons with good results as well.  A quick look at pricewatch
shows MX400's for $60 and MX200's for $40.  If you're willing to spend
$40 for a game and $11-$13 a month to play, $40-$60 dollars for a
video card to play it on is nothing.  Not to mention the fact that you'll
need at least that for most other games coming out this year.  Anything
written with hardware T&L in mind is going to need a more recent card
to play well on.

People with 400-500mhz CPU's and a decent video card are running
at 1024x768 with acceptable framerates.
