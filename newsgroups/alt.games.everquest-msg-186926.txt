Enron didn't happen over night.. the theft of secrets by the chinese
didn't happen over night.. Bin Laden attacked the WTC while Herr
Klinton was in office.. and he had another 6-7 years to catch him and
didn't.

As someone else pointed out.. Klinton spent a lot of time, money and
men attacking other countries.. all without EVER asking anyone else or
getting permission from the UN.

Klintons *morals* allowed this country to live with rose colored
glasses.. ignoring the downfall of the .com.. ignoring the rampant
excess and hiding of problems by companies like Enron and AOL (check
your headlines on CNN.. AOLTW is under *review* and its top executives
are being investigated for *aiding and abetting* for inflating their
stock.

Exactly WHAT was good about Klinton? Please tell us what he did that
we not now having to fix because of his fuckups while in office?

Klinton is so great.. he is only one of less than 3 (IIRC) presidents
to be impeached.. Yea.. great track record.
