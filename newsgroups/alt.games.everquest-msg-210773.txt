I dont really like this for 2 reasons.

1) Equipment is going to degenerate into time served again instead of
progress made . They have been very carefull to put good equilment only at
the end of hard mobs . This is going to destroy all that effort.

2) One of the major things that keeps people from cheating is that most of
the realy good information is all kept server side . The ability to modify
equipment is going to change that . Any half decent hacker is going to be
able to create ridiculous equipment now for no cost 8/
