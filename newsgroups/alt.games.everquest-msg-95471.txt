Dying to ask you - where's Scochland? I'm a Scot myself with Scots blood - I
can only assume you have a serious Whisky drinking problem! :o)

I was lucky enough to run into a level 30 Half-elf slaughtering her way
through Blackburrow the other day and after politely asking if I could loot,
made several very lucrative trips to and from Train Town. I think the deal
in Blackburrow is more to do with faction than experience since it's the
quickest way to get good faction in Qeynos.
