Think about this:

They want to make a new game, based (somewhat) on the success of the first
game. IF they are smart they would make this new game different enough from
the first game to appeal to EQ1 users who have already reached the top of
the food chain, and still keep EQ1 around for those of us who have yet to
make it that far.

By rethinking original EQ1 approaches and tempering them with what the
players want, hopefully they'll produce something as entertaining as EQ1,
but with new appeal! Imagine that!

What would be the sence of making EQ2 just like EQ1? Snazzy graphics only go
so far, I mean do the new graphics really make EQ1 any better of a game?
Mechanics and gameplay make the game, a POS with good graphics is still a
POS, a solid game with POS graphics has potential.
