There is the hammer from OT, that procs a gate to OT, other than that,
The Gate talisman from PoP zones is the only quested one I am aware of 
off the top of my head.  It's a very long and involved quest, and does 
require you to be Fire flagged to complete the final 3rd talisman with 
infinite charges.  The first one is relatively easy, if you are of a 
level to be in Tier 1 and PoP zones.  It has 5 (I think) charges.  The 
second one requires access to most Tier 2 PoP zones as I recall.

As I recall, the tradeskilled items are available for all priest classes, 
and they port you to near your home city.

Wizards and Druids do have the crucible of escape that has unlimited 
charges of succor.
