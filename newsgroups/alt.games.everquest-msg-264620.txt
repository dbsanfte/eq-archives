That's exactly how the Ward works in EQ2. The player Warded actually sees 
the message "Your Ward has absorbed 125 damage!", and so on until the limit 
of the Ward has been reached and the icon then disappears from your Effects 
window. As the caster of the Ward, I see a visual representation of the 
state of the Ward in my "Maintained Effects" window, where I can tooltip to 
see the state of the timer (as with any buff) and can visually see the icon 
draining down toward expiration. It's a kind of highlighting, or shading, 
like a water line where as soon as you cast it you start to see the line go 
lower and lower in the icon, indicating visually and instantly how much of 
the Ward is left. When big hits are taken you see the icon drop a lot, even 
as you watch it slowly deplete from its inherent timer. Actually, all buffs 
have this water line shading effect, but with the Ward you see the big drops 
as big hits are absorbed.
