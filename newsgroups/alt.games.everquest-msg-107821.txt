Yes, I do it even in crap loot zones. I figure that makes up for the
get-rich zones where the gems drop like flies. One must try to balance the
zones one hunts in- there are few zones that are great for xp *and* loot.

I find that if I don't offer SoW, they wonder if I don't want to buff them.
I've already refused them symbol, and Heroic Bond is a group thing. My group
is willing to wait for me to med after I do everyone. And staggering this
buff is good.
