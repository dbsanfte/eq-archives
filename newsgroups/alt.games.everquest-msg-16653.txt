In depth RP really can make any game more fun, but especially EQ.  Its a
shame that it never really caught on more, as it can add much more
meaning and enjoyment to the game, the real answer to avoiding "hack and
slash" mentality.  But it also has a dark side......<eg>

When retail came out I created a character on a server away from my
friends to play a persona I had fleshed out for a lone paladin.  Not
being on a server with folks I knew was the key to keeping him pure. 
I'd log with my friends when they were around, then later go play this
lone paladin.  He developed into quite the madman, as paladins often do
when left to their own devices.  Within two months I had to stop playing
this char, as his holy madness started bleeding into my real life.  I
found myself becoming too nice in real life for my own good.  Sure you
can be a sacrificial lamb in a game, but in the real world you get eaten
alive being that good hehe.  

Check out more info on the web if RP interests you, maybe start to work
up more of a personality separate from your own for your characters, but
be careful... hehe.
