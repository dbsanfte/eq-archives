That would be more tempting if they didn't state that they were going
to be wiping accounts that were inactive for more than six months.  It
would be neat to log back into my main SWG guy to see what the change
in the way you got the Jedi did to him (I collected badges since there
was nothing left to do in the game).  That, coupled with the mass
exodus my friends executed really don't leave me much reason to log
back in.
