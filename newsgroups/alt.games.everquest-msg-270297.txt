WoW is balanced for a different kind of gamer.  Hardcore grinders and level
freaks will get bored and leave.  This may well be exactly what Blizzard has
in mind.

Unlike SOE, I don't expect Blizzard to bend over backwards to please this
kind of gamer at the expense of the rest of their population.  If they do,
I'll leave WoW as surely as I've left all varieties of EQ.

I started gaming in the early 70's.  I started computer gaming on my trusty
Commodore VIC-20.  I've watched pencil and paper D&D become Zork, Zork
become MUDs, and MUDs become MMO games.  I believe that qualifies me as an
experienced gamer.

Yes, I know exactly what I'm looking for.  I didn't find it in EQ2.

Please do not presume to tell me (or anyone else) what they should or
shouldn't like.  It only makes you look like an ass (or a game reviewer,
which is more often than not the same thing).
