He didn't log, he gated.  Gating is a spell.  And if he is correct and 
other people weren't responding and fighting, then he had every right to 
do so.  AND if the person who went AFK died, well, that's what you get 
for going AFK in a dangerous area.  I fought off mobs for some guy who'd 
fallen asleep at his keyboard for ages, but I finally had to run because 
I couldn't handle them all.  And he died.  I never lead groups, so it's 
usually up to someone else to give the "RUN!" order, but when they do, if 
I can, I use gate.  Easier than running and *hoping* you live till the 
zone/guard.  (This is another reason I prefer my shaman - perma-SoW is a 
wonderful place to be.)

At this point in time, the exp I lose isn't a great amount, so I don't 
worry *too* much - I've fought several times and died just because I was 
pissed at the mob and wanted to get in all the damage I could.  But I can 
understand how a high level that wasn't getting a lot of help from a 
group would take the only way out they could.  Actually, I'm surprised 
that person managed.  Gate has a fairly long cast time, and usually I 
can't get it off before I'm beaten into the ground.
