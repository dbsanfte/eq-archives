I tried the defenders lightblade in the off hand and found that its simply
to slow to maintain aggro well. If I were you I would go for a quick
hitting, proccing weapon in the off hand. I use a Sword of the bloodsworn
primary, and Copper Hammer of Striking off hand, and I find that Im able to
hold aggro much easier with that combination.
