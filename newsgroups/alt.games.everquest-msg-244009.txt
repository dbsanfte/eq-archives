So I hit level 39 with my bard today and want to give swarm kiting
another try...  I went to DSP near ME zone 'cause I thought this would
be a perfect place to practice the technique on tribal gatherers.

As per my understanding, to swarm kite: charm one mob, make it attack
another mob in a group, watch them beat it down, invis to break charm,
chant to finish it off... rinse and repeat.

So I charm a wanderer, send it into the camp to attack another mob,
those two fight and the rest attack me even if I'm standing at quite a
distance...   They all run after me and I circle around so they're in
a small group of 6 or 7 mobs (similar to aoe quadding), charm another,
make him attack his buddy, those two stop and fight, the rest come
after me.

Any advice on what I'm doing wrong?  I really want to learn this
techniqe as supposedly it's one of the most powerful techniques in the
game, but I'm not having much luck.. 

Also, is there any easy way to toggle between targets in the group?  I
find it very difficult to target (especially since the new engine) a
single mob in a close group.  The motd says there's new hotkeys but
doesn't say how to use them.

Thanks
