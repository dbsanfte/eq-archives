I can't speak for old players and as for new players, I can only
speak for myself. I still have fun. :) Where I think the problem
is that the new players who aren't 'having fun' are running into
the problems is that they're doing the XP grind all of the time
that they're on. LDoNs are fun for me. The first one of the day,
that is. I can't see any fun in doing four, three, even two in a
row. That's not 'fun', IMO. I see no 'fun' in going to the same
spot for hours at a time, days at a time. (Well, okay, I'm doing
that now when I farm acrylia or condensed shadows, but that's for
a day or two or three then I go do the 'fun' things.)

I guess it's the way you approach the game. For a lot of people,
it's XP grind until/unless their guild/friends have a special
hunt/raid set up. I can't see a whole lot of fun in that. For me,
it's running around in new areas, playing for a while here, playing
for a while there, with maybe a week or two of XP grind thrown in
every month or two. If I ever do make it to 65, I'll be a well-
rounded char, IMO. The majority of my tradeskills will have been
taken to around 200, I will have hit a large percentage of the
zones available and will have at least a little bit of knowledge
about them, and had some fun along the way.
