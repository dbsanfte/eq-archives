Not that this will surprise anyone, but SWG has been a total cluster*$&$ so
far.

Javascript errors during the registration process.... unavailable webpages
for support and now it seems the entire official forum has gone offline.

I don't know why I expected it to be any different, but just had hoped
Lucasfilm's involvement mighta brought some pressure to get it done right.
