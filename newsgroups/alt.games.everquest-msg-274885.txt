	Here's how I think they should redo the boats:

	Have a nice big zone like the abysmal sea boat.  The zone ins to this 
zone cycle through three states:  5 minutes they open to antonica, 10 minutes
they dont work at all (the boat's at sea) and 5 minutes they open to faydwer.
The dockside zone ins might have to be doors of some kind to avoid having
to change the graphics or they could actually have the boat sail up like
it used to...

	They've already got the progamming for this: nexus spires are sort
of the same kind of timer...
