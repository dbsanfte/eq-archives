It is annoying, given that I have just spent 16 tradeskill levels doing 
nothing but alchemy, a few spells for myself and friends, and some 
support items for the spells, paper and quills.  I really should be

really made a final decision on which skill to pursue, still waffling 
between alchemy and scribe.
