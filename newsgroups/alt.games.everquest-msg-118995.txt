Not only is Java case sensitive, but Sun has certain style
guidelines you'd probably hate, such as:

Socket socket = new Socket(...);

Note that the first Socket (uppercase S) is the class and
socket (lowercase s) is the object.

designed Java libraries, look out...

Lots of foolish people think Java is a silver bullet.
