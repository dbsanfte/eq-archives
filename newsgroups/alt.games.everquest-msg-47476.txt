Thanks everyone so much for responding and ignoring the incorrect
subject line.

In summary:

1) It could be that wisdom helps your success rate and that int helps
   skill up rate.
    -or-
2) It could be that highest of int or wis helps both success and skill ups.

3) All seem to agree that high strength can help in smithing (how much is
   not certain)

4) www.eqtraders.com has a good forum for asking such questions as this.

All seem to agree that waiting till later when you can afford the wis/int
gear would probably be a good idea.  That coupled with creating a high
elf enchanter (preferably because of their enchanting ore capability)
might be a good way to get a high level smither.

From other things I've read, most seem to agree that the time spent and cost
is only worth it if you enjoy making things for other people.  The monetary
rewards aren't there, compared to other activities such as looting and trading.

I do like making stuff, especially for newbies that don't have a lot of money.
So far I've been charging them about 50% over my out-of-pocket cost.  This
doesn't include the opportunity cost of selling the silks or pelts I've looted.
So it's really selling stuff dirt cheap.  However, this doesn't depress the
market, because there really isn't a market for the crap armor I've been
selling (patchwork!) :-)

At first glance, I think I'll continuing levelling up and then create a high
elf enchanter that both smiths and tailors.  I can twink him with the int
and wis stuff as my bard starts making some significant pp...
(which won't be for a while yet).

I hope this posting might help someone else who's in a similar position
as me.

Thanks again,

- Corey
