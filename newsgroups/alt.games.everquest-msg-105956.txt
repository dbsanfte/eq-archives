Run3 is 30% faster than normal run speed, JBoots are 35%.

So it's almost as fast, and the difference is hardly
noticeable.

Along with the other advantages that people have already
posted, Run3 is in effect all the time, which means that
you also have it on corpse runs, which isn't the case
for JBoots (because the JBoots will be on your corpse).
