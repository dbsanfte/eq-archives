I have always maintained that the SWG fubar was only about 33% SoE's 
fault... there were so many things that they should know better about...

Of course if the rumors are right and LA takes SWG away from SoE, I'm of 
the opinion it will be an unmitigated disaster if they do what the 
rumors are saying they plan.
