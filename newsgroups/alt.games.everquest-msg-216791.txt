Who's the idiot who decided to Round Down the health of the MoB's? It just
never dawned on me that someone in a (hypothetical) life and death situation
would Round Down the health of there opponent. If whoever you're fighting
still has the ability to kill then obviously they are not at 0% health.
Really now how hard would it be to round up on the health and show it at 1%?
