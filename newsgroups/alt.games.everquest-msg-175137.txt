Hey ya'll,
Mostly I just thought I'd say hello.  I played EQ for a few months after
Kunark came out, but had to give it up when my ancient behemoth of a
computer couldn't handle it anymore.  I recently got a snazzy new system
and a copy of Everquest Gold as a gift, so decided to delve back in.

I never got that far my first time around - mid teens - mostly because I
spent most of my time going places I knew I shouldn't and dying in
unspeakably creative ways.  Any tips for a newbie coming in?  I've been
lurking here for a few days, and you guys didn't seem to bite new folk's
heads off, so I thought I'd venture out.  I've seen a few posts
mentioning a lack of newbies around - think it'll be impossible to find
groups just starting out?  If that's the case, which classes solo the
best these days?

Anyways, hello.  I think I'll trundle off and see if any of the EQ sites
I used to browse at are still around.  Thanks in advance to anyone who
takes the time to answer.  Feel free to ignore me too - ya'll probably
get questions like this all the time.
