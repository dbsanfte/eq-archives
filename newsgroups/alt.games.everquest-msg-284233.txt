When did keys and flags appear?  The old world EQ zones had keys within the 
zone that you had to get to go deeper in (like Befallen and Najena.)  As far 
as I can tell, Veshans Peak is the first instance where there was an effort 
made to prevent players from gaining access to content.  The whole idea of 
keys and flags has become so prevalent in EQ that it has literally destroyed 
several guilds I've been involved in.  Either you can make a video game your 
full time job and put in the hours and hours required to open up content 
that you've already paid for, or you you play when you can and do what you 
can do in the zones you can go to.

Personally, I'm not going to put 40 hours per week into a video game just so 
I can see zones the developers are hiding from me (despite paying them for 
it.)  I hate keys and flags and wish pain and suffering on the jerk who 
thought up that stupid idea.
