Trivial Levels are very deceptive in EQ. My Ranger has a fletching skill of
136 and still gets fails on the basic arrows that trivial at a skill of 16.
Not often, and I've not tracked it to be exact, but would guess it around 1
in 75 to 1 in 100. Similarly, my enchanter has a 168 smithing skill, and
very rarely fails, again an untracked guess, but about 1 fail in 25
attempts, on banded mantles which don't go trivial for him for about ten
more points yet. Basically the only thing that a "trivial level" will
guarantee is that you will no longer advance your skill from making that
item. Personally, I think if you fail at something that is supposed to be
trivial to you, it should give an automatic raise of one skill point to that
trade skill. After all, are professional tradespersons not expected to learn
from the mistakes they make?
