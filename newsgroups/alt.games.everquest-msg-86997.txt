Been working on this problem and depending on the answer, I think I've
solved it. I have a friend who's a Dark Elf Cleric that become KOS to Neriak
early on, like before there were able to train meditate. I was wondering if
I had my character invis them, if they could train at the Cleric guild in
Shadowhaven.
