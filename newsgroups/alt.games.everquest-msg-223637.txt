It's most likely his BP.  I have an earring from Vex Thal which has
the same right click - Invigorate - 100 HPs self only heal with a long
(or really long depending on the item) recast time.

My vendor has an All/All necklace with a single click of Healing or
something which I picked up at some point although I don't remember
the name and no-one wants to buy it..
