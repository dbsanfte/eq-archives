Even the Warriors who troll the PoN class balance forum admit freely
that highend Warriors out-aggro Knights over time.  Dual-wielding EB
proc'ing weapons with Anger 3 augs while wearing one of the PoP items
that magnifies aggro and with WA5 increasing proc frequency by 50%
has that effect.  The key there is the "over time" part, Knights
still "get out of the gate" faster and more reliably aggro-wise than
Warriors, and they have more flexibility, especially at range and vs.
multiple mobs.

So can anybody else with a Taunt button, like, say, another Warrior.

Actually, at the same time Incite went in Warriors gained the ability
to chain Furious to Defensive, which I've seen highend Warriors claim
is more powerful than Incite (to them, the guys with dual EB/Anger
setups who weren't having significant aggro issues).

There are precisely two mobs, in forced single group content, who
react in that fashion to Defensive/Evasive/Stonewall (only, not to
Warrior void discs).  This allowed them to retune the encounters
so that only Warriors or Knights with very highend gear can tank
the.  No more dragging along a bazaar geared Warrior twink to tank
the boss.  No more 11khp 2.5kac Knights going splat 85% of the time
IN FORCED SINGLE-GROUP CONTENT.

Cry me a river, your raid tanking tool was overpowered IN FORCED
SINGLE-GROUP CONTENT, so it received the tiniest nerf in the
history of the game, boo hoo.  Pretty much every damned class
strength Knights have ever had has been (deservedly) nerfed
directly or indirectly at least once.  Current content changes
(i.e. new stuff is introduced), the old rules don't quite work
right anymore, so SOE changes the rules.  It's been that way in
EQ forever.  Requiring a Warrior in order to have better than a
15% chance of defeating the key encounter at the end of an hours
long instanced trial restricted to 6 characters was totally bogus,
and they fixed it.

Forced single-group encounters in which time-geared Knights have
substantially less chance of success than pre-Elemental Warriors
are bogus, so they fixed 'em.  Lots of Knights (and some Warriors)
are still bitching about how hard GoD content is, but judging by
forum traffic there seem to be as many guilds who use Knights
effectively in KT+ as who don't.  So it's probably mostly a matter
of using sound tactics for the content and not expecting to be
able to breeze through GoD just because you made it into PoTime
last week.
