Go inside Kael Drakkel on a raid or a good hunting party.
Kill the named giants, they are worth a lot of faction.

Seen this posted a while ago, no idea if its accurate
but it seems correct to me:

    [Assuming "Indifferent" starts at an arbitrary 0]:
    -xxx to -751    ...scowls at you, ready to attack
    -750 to -501    ...glares at you threateningly
    -500 to -101    ...glowers at you dubiously
    -100 to   -1    ...looks your way apprehensively
       0 to   99    ...regards you indifferently
     100 to  499    ...judges you amiably
     500 to  749    ...kindly considers you
     750 to +xxx    ...looks upon you warmly
    +xxx to +???    ...considers you an ally

Factions max out at +2000 points over base.

Base is what your race class and religion are
to the faction in question.

In one night of hunting inside Kael Drakkel I went
from amiable to ally with my monk. I know my party
only killed about 50 giants, but they were mostly named
ones.
