You are right about one thing... I did send you an IM, wishing you luck
in your life and calling off the flame war.  Everything else you typed
is you trying to get back at me for hurting your feelings. Well I
already apoligized and I wont do much more than that. Pursue this if
you want Chamzel.

You really shouldn't be apoligizing for the emarr community for other
people. Everyone here is capable of judging others for themselves.
