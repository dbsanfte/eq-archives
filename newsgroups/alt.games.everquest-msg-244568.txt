It seems to me there are two popular images of monks. One is the 
spiritual pacifist ministering type in robes, maybe even taking a vow of 
silence. The other is the self-aware type, so in tune with his own body 
and mind that he can ignore pain and yes, even lower his metabolism to 
the point of appearing dead. 

This second monk, having such intimate knowledge and familiarity with his 
body, is able to use balance and momentum to maneuver his body at peak 
efficiency so as to avoid damage as well as channel his energy and force 
it into well-placed blows which can be devastating in their accuracy and 
force. Their abilities in self-healing are another characterizing aspect.

That's the way *I've* always viewed monks from my various readings of 
historical and fantasy literature and movie viewing.
