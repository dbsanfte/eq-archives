I see many thing will come to pass that shall vex thee inhabitants of Norrath.
A massive rise in the halfling population, many bearing the name Phrodo or even
ThrowDough. Hordes of rangers shall be born, Strieduh shall be their names.
Wizards will rise in numbers, GannDalfTheGrey and SarowMan will walk among
them. Dwarves shall flourish, Gimbli and it's variations.
Cries shall be heard:
BillBow Shouts "Loc of mount doom plzzzzz?"
Gandelf Shouts "WTB pointy hat"
FrowDo Shouts "Ho ho ho to the bottle i go..."

Orcs should be given the week off because there will be mass genocide with
extreme prejudice. Any player referencing the film in a chat format other than
ooc should be booted and have their account banned immediatley. PvP should be
implemented on all servers for one week so we can gank those little bastards.
For the newsgroup:
"The subscribers of alt.games.everquest. reserve the right to mercilessley
flame the author of any post which might contain the following: 'LoTR totally
copied EQ'
'Lava storm looks just like mordor'  'Any quests involving rings?'  'Nazi' "

Perhaps it wont be that bad eh? sleep well, dont have nightmares.
