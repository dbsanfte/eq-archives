Is it possible to set up a hotkey to switch between weapons? I read a
post somewhere that seemed to indicate you could.

I picked up a Scimitar of Oak off Rhag 2 last night. Stats don't
compare to the druid epic but it casts a free 200dmg root which would
be nice to use from time to time. Allakhazam has the root casting time
as instant (lol!) with a zero recast time. [I had a brief amusing
thought of being able to do 12k dmg per minute -- "Set the cheal
rotation time to 1 guys, I'm opening up on Tormax"]. 

If I can't easily switch weapons or if the casting time sucks,  I
suppose I could use it to taunt the other druids (see what you'd get
if you came on raids?).
