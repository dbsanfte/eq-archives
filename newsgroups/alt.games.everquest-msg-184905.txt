I am soooo fraggin proud Dolorn my 10th level Cleric has just got ALL of his
newbie<?> armor quests INCLUDING breastplate completed!!!! I am overjoyed at
this whooo hoo!

Now I know this isnt as big as Solo-ing a god on one of the planes or your
guild Uber-looting spawn camping a super kill, but this little bit has made
me over joyed and probably an eq player for a long long time!

Just wanted to share with my fellow players

Chris
