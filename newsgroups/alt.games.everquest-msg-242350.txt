You have my sympathies. :)  I think both versions have things of merit, 
and we should try to get all the good stuff, so here goes:

-------

6.7 Q:  I've joined too many channels and now the text is flying by too
fast!  What to do??  How do I open multiple chat windows?

A: Chat windows allow a player to use multiple windows for specific chat
tasks.  For example, if you are on a guild raid you can have all your 
say and guild text in one window, and your raid and battle spam in 
another.  You can create as many windows as you like, but most players
opt for no more than two or three, as the screen gets too busy.

Right click on the black title bar of your main main chat window where it 
says "Main Chat".  The second option down on the list is "New chat 
window".  Left click on that to bring up your new chat window.  Your new 
chat window will appear over the top of the main chat window, and can be 
dragged to another location and re-sized if you wish.

In the new chat window, right click on the title bar and choose filters.  
Another menu opens which allows you to choose which types of messages go 
into the new window.  You can continue customizing these windows with 
the filters to split the different types of chat between the windows.

6.8 Q:  My map window fills my whole screen and I can't see where I'm 
going with it up!  Help!

A:  The map window, and in fact all windows, can be made transparent by  
opening up the menu for the window and right clicking on its title bar, 
then hovering the cursor above the first option, "Window".  This will show 
another drop down menu.  Hover the cursor over "Alpha", then select faded 
level by left clicking.  You will get a box to enter a value of 0 to 100.  
0 will make the box, but not the text, completely transparent, 100 will
make the box completely opaque, and 50 will make it semi-transparent.  
Please note that you cannot generally click on or target things through a 
transparent window.

------

I should note that I'm not 100% sure about which actions are right clicks, 
which are left, and where both will work.  Someone who has a running EQ 
handy should check. :)
