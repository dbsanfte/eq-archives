As a troll SK, I make trips back to the swamp now and then and find some new
trolls to give some gear to.   I inspect them first to make sure they need
it, then ask them if they are serious about playing the char (like I get an
honest answer right?).

Still strangers, of course, but if feels better to help my own kind and to
run across them later in life to find how they are doing.
