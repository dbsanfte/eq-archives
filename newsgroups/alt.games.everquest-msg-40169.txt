Well, for what it's worth, I did see 2400 on Innoruuk the other night
when I logged on, and I saw over 2200 when I logged off.  I think
that's about as high as I've ever seen it for those times.  I had been
logging on earlier and staying later (between jobs at the moment), but
when I did an 8-11pm session, the numbers where almost exactly where
they were before school let out.  Also, Innoruuk is one of the oldest
non-split servers, and usually one of the 5 most active during
prime-time, which could indicate some folks leaving due to burnout and
not being replaced by new folks.  However, seeing 2400 folks on the
week that school resumes leads me to believe that not that many folks
are leaving.  (I have also never seen Innoruuk hit 2500, 2400 and a
bit of change is as active as I've ever seen it.)
