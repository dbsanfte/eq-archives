I can top that.

I had a mule sitting by the Freeport gates.  She was level 3,
not anon, and had nothing on her except her "born with" newbie gear.

A level 12 character comes up to her, *inspects* her, sees
that she's got nothing but her newbie robe and dagger, period,
then proceeds to beg her for pp and equipment.
