The tunnel that you zone into is pretty safe (except that I've seen a very
occasional wandering Froglok warrior in the tunnels).  When you come out of
the tunnel into FV and make the left to go to LOIO, you do have to put up
with the Drachnids, but if you're careful, stay invis (some Drachnids see
through invis, but many/most don't) and stay on the wall you'll be fine.
