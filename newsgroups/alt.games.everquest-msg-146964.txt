Not sure how much int or wis he had but I didn't have near enough mana
to safely do the cougars at 29.  My int was 182.

The only creatures I found I could safely manage were the
Lightcrawlers in Dawnshroud Peaks.  They seemed to have a very small
amount of HP for a blue at the time.  I took a beating trying to pull
4 of them though.  I couldn't afford to waste mana so I had to run up
and whack em with my staff to get thier attention.  Not a good
strategy for a 90 lb. bag of brittle bones wizard but it worked.

If you have some friends and you are a wiz.  I strongly suggest going
for a staff of temperate flux.  Free pulling from afar.  Distance
guaging for your BoF and you give all 4 mobs a nice little debuff
against your cold and fire spells.

I never realy got good at this until I got my staff and my lvl 34
spells.  29 to 34 it is possible to quad but much more difficult than
34 and up.

Still try some to learn.  It brings back some of the exitement you
might have lost with the old root and nuke routine.
