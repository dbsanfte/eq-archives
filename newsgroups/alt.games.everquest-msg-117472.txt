I can remember many a time where we've had 1 60 shaman on a raid, its not so
bad nowadays (i can bot my 60 shaman, we have some other 60 shamans, and a
few 55+). Only 2 have ST keys tho, 1 is currently inactive due to his
parents health, the other is always debugging, buffing, deciding loots,
raids etc.

We recently started giving casters keys (2 wizards and a druid), so of our
55-60 or so keys, 2 shamans have a key, 1 magician, 2 wizards and 2 druids.

Our 60 rangers all have primal (excluding new recruits) anyway, for TS.

I don't think it was intended.. but they could have at least fixed it..
/sigh
After the recent big patch, all the warders were back up.. so gm's had to
/kill them.  This stopped the sleeper script running, so I'd imagine all the
zone changes were in that script - and haven't been able to execute.

Thats why its such a ruined zone.

We have most of our primal.. but for the very last few, and new recruits, it
really does suck ass nowadays to equip them with theirs

Plus, only 1 mage and 2 wizards have keys - and all are played by mains.  It
would be unfair to equip twink wizards and a mage with keys, over a 60 melee
that still needs primal.
