I was running through the new tutorial when it released last night and was
very impressed. I think they've realised there's lots of 'gamer widows' out
there and want to get people's spouses signed up. The only gripe i have is
that the newbie gets an awesome charm. Now, I haven't been able to play much
due to problems with the australian telecommunications monopoly (I have
ADSL, but the local phone exchange is congested and they don't care), but my
druid's 57 and wasn't able to solo a charm in LoY... I aim to try for one in
LDoN when I can connect through a different phone provider, but seriously, I
have level 12 alts that I'm considering re-rolling so that they can get the
charm!

This is silly; they should make the charm available everywhere. Just have a
vendor selling a token for one plat (or a thousand, but one would be nice)
that you can hand in elsewhere for the no-drop charm. I resent having this
darn charm slot sitting empty!
