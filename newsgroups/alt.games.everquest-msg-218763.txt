I gave up on Khosh and the chads thread.  Not because I agree with
Khosh, but because it's clear he'll never even *see* my point of
view, much less *agree* with it.  I sense a kind of close mindedness
that's just not worth the aggravation to argue with.

His stance seemed to end with, "It's always been good enough," and
"if the government mandates it's okay, it's okay".  Some things the
government mandates *isn't* good enough and *not* okay.

If we all took that approach, we'd all still think the Earth was
flat.  Sometimes you have to say, "No, it's not okay, even if
they say it is."  That's how I feel about punch card ballots.
