My wife plays on a Laptop. It is a Dell Insperion 8000 Mobile desktop.
Pentium 3 1GHz, 512MB RAM, and a 32 MB Geforce 2GO Video card. It runes just
fine with all the Luclin models on, skies and the whole shot, in 1024X768X32
resolution. If you can stomach the $2300 US price tag, it is a great puter
for both EQ and everything else you may do with it.
