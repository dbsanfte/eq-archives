Not that I see from you description.  I'm surprised that it didn't agro on
you though unless they had already engaged it and it was returning (ie
feared it, etc).  I was told by a Guide when I had petitioned involving a
group that was KSing my group, that basically it was OK to pull away
additional mobs joining the fray as long as no one had actually engaged.
(He never saw what we called a KS, though as soon as he left...).  It's
amazing how worked up people will get over dime a dozen mobs, though.
