Speaking for myself, I was.  The main reason I bought OoW was for the tasks,
and they were pretty much useless. YMMV.

Like you, I can only go by what they've advertised.  They mentioned one new
zone and a rework of Lavastorm.

My comments were based purely on that.

If they release dthe number of new zones they did in OoW, I would rethink my
position.  But why not advertise it?

If they're throwing bones to tradeskiller, again ... why not advertise it?
I hadn't even noticed until you brought it up that tradeskilling per se
isn't mentioned at all, unless 'potion bandoliers' are meant as ways to
reinforce alchemy.

That's bad news for those who buy it.  Their recent track record at graphics
enhancements isn't such that it could be used as a selling point. ;-P

That may be, in your opinion, the best expansion that SOE made.  IMO, the
best expansion in the history of the game belongs to Verant.  Again, YMMV.

> There's more to making an expansion great than just  "zones".

In all deference to tradeskillers, without new content in the form of new
zones that contain new mobs that hold new challenges the game becomes
stagnant.    Oh, yay .. I can go to a zone that I've long since outgrown or
become tired of hoping for new drops so I can tailor a new hood.  Yippee
skippy.

If it wasn't like that before, it's certainly become that way since the
introduction of the bazaar. Why schlep through some boring zone for the drop
myself? I can wait for some other schmoe to do it and I'll either buy the
drop or buy the hood itself.
