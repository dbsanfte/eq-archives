You can overwrite a lower level mez with a longer one now?  This would
actually make the AE mez useful.

  I just restarted my Enchanter.  I had retired him at 33rd quite
awhile ago.  Hit a wall at this level as I died like 5 times in a row
while grouping - mez add, resisted; mobs make beeline for enchanter;
stun, resisted, stun, resisted; dead enchanter.  Prior to the low
thirties the mobs weren't double hitting for 100+ and you could
actually survive more than 5 seconds.  Tried various strategies to
combat this but continued to die so retired him in favor of other
classes (Bard, Shaman, Wizard, various tanks).  Enchanter had grouped
exclusively and never soloed.

  My experiences with my bard charm kiting made me want to try the
Enchanter at it.  What a difference.  I zoomed from 33 to 35 in a few
hours.  Enchanter soloed effortlessly.  Only tricky part was
discovering which mobs break charm quickly and which mobs almost never
break charm.  I now think my enchanter solos almost as well as my
Wizard (doesn't beats quad kiting).
