Hmm, I don't think I agree with you guys on this one. I love role-playing,
it's why I created Winterfury on the FV server, and it's also why I created
Doc Justice, my CoH main, with a backstory, a battlecry, and color-matching
text messages that try and create the atmosphere I envision for my character
when I'm performing various heroic acts. And while I usually refer to him as
my "character", every once in a while I'll use shorthand and talk about my
"toon" just as I will occasionally say Grats! or describe a "mob" instead of
a "villain". Honestly, I don't see the problem here guys.
