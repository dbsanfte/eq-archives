I've running EQ2 on my current system moderately well, with features
turned down.  I'm using an Athlon XP 2200+ with 1 Gig of RAM on a
Hercules Radeon 9700 128MB.

I have the resources to buy a high end card, �300 or so, but will it
drastically improve my EQ2 play, considering the other components are
ageing a little?

So the question is, should I go for something like a Radeon x800 Pro
256MB, for around �300, or keep a little back and go for something a
bit cheaper?
