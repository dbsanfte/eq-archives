But why does weapon speed matter, rather than DPS?  Yeah, I admit
it's nice seeing my strikes spamming up the chat window, but I'd
rather kill the mobs faster!  If the Stave of Shielding swings only
2/3 as often, but does more than 3/2 the damage on average, why
isn't it better?

Okay, I know that faster weapons mean more chances to skill up, and
more chances to proc if the weapon has a proc, but if those aren't
considerations, why else?  Oh, and there's also at least one downside
to a faster weapon: if the target has a damage shield, you'd rather
concentrate your damage into fewer hits.  Actually, I can see wanting
to have primary/secondary weapons of different speeds, to increase
the chance of interrupting a spellcasting mob, but I'm not sure how
much that matters in practice.
