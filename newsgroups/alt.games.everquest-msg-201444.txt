I still make a bit of cash porting backwards and forwards.

I would buy all the single ports so you can go pick people up where ever
they are.

Nexus is the most common port requested.
Stone brunt is next being the access point to frog world.

The others are higher level anyway, but as I made money porting people about
I bought the others when I could afford it.

Our server has a taxi channel, so you don't have to spend you time sat in
pok or nexus :)
