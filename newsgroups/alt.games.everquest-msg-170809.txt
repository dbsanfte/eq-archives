I finished 50-51 in Echo Caverns on the Underbulks, Stonegrabbers, and
Fungal Fiends.  A lot of them are light blue at 50, but still fast, easy
exp.  I would clear the room just in time to med and then when mana was full
again they started to pop.

I also got good exp in EW in the area between the GD zone and Rygorrs.  The
Manticores, Wooly Rhino's and some Griffons and Wolves and Mammoths are DB.
I was here because I needed stuff for the Coldain Shawl Quests, but it was
good solo exp as well.
