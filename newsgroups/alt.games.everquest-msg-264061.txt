It used to be you could /q before disengaging from a corpse after you 
had looted the last item, but before letting go. But I'm not sure if 
that works wtih the new corpose poof graphics which seem to go off after 
a few seconds if the corpse is empty regardless of what you do.

I don't think CS is allowed to provide a rez if you died to normal 
circumstances and then looted your corpse. If they did it would be 
tantamount to opening the doors to every twit who dies to get a free CS 
rez... merely loot their corpse and then petition'whoops - i looted my 
corpse before the cleric rezed it'.

Its a kludge that you have to leave items on your body to get rezzes in 
the first place. It would be silly to build more mechanics around that 
idea. Better to rework it so that it leaves empty rezzable corpses on 
the the ground by default instead of poofing them, and then give you a 
'manual option' to clear the corpse if you don't want it.
