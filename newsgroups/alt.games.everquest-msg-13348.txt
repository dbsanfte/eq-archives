The Yes, sir we recovered your wallet, and this was the person who had
it, He did have in his possession $123 However, we cannot prove that it
was yours therefore we cannot return it to you.  Please appear in court
at the designated time to testify against him, or he will go free as
well.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
