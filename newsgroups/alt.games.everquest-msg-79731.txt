	I see other people have beaten this to death already, but yes, arrows are
at least as dangerous as swords, and probably more.

	Archery in EQ needs the following:

	>> Damage bonus just like all other primary-hand weapons (does not seem to
apply currently, despite being displayed; furthermore the bonus currently
displayed is that of a 1H weapon, not a 2H.)

	>> Minimum damage just like all other primary-hand weapons (at least the
damage rating of the arrow)

	>> Major overhaul of line-of-fire rules; arrows are getting lost in the
landscape (with no hit/miss message), flying around their targets for ages
before landing, mobs touching walls or the like are considered immune to
arrows for some reason, etc.

	>> Rangers (only) should use the same line-of-fire restrictions as
spellcasting; if we can cast on it we should be able to shoot at it.

	>> Fix the Falcon Eye line of Ranger spells so they actually do something
(testing indicates no statistically significant effect on any of them).

	>> Trueshot is feeble, often produces no significant improvement; should
have the damage increased, the recycle time lowered, or both.

	Archery is a fairly useful skill for 51+ Rangers, thanks to the damage
bonus for engaged targets, but it still needs some work.
