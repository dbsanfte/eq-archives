Mastadons and Rhinos are not social, in the quadding sense. And
therefore are not good quad targets.

Social mobs, for purposes of this discussion, are races which will never
run, but instead fight to the death if there is another of their kin (or
ally race that they are social with, e.g. the walrus and the ulthork)
still there in the battle.
