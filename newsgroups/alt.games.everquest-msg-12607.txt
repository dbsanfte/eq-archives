I was running the same setup. What OS are you using? I was using both
Win2K and Win98. At the time EQ wouldn't run under Win2K, but it would
run under Win98 with the original video driver (NOT the most recent). 

When they did their big changover to DX7, it started doing the exact
same thing it does to you. However, it then began running fine under
Win2K. Go figure.
