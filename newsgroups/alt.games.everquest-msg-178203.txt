Shadow Warrior
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - Eric Bloom - Donald Roeser - Eric Van Lustbader - )

I have no home. I live within my mind.
I have no one. No one I'm bringing up to the sky with me.

No weapon - I carry no sword, only my hands to protect me.
No laws - I obey no laws; my spirit is righteous and free.
Her face, the image of a thousand wonders.
A bridge between today and yesterday.
If I pull her close what will the spirit say?

I have no home. I live within my mind.
I have no one. No one I'm bringing up to the sky with me.

Her face, the image of a thousand stars.
A bridge between tomorrow and today.
If we destroy one another, Dolman will ever break the day.

Day breaks, but there is no light.
In my mind, a voice calling.
Spirit singing, a song of the ages.
Depend on today, like father's honor,
She has come to take it away!

[Instrumental]

I see - my life has flashed as the star meets my head.
Body of an angel, with the strength of ten men;
Through the trees, dark as a raven, black hair flying -
The justice of Heaven.

I have no home. I live within my mind.
I have no one, no one. My spirit is righteous and free.
No weapon - I carry no sword, only my hands to protect me.
No laws - I obey no laws; without honor, you'll never be free.

[Instrumental]
