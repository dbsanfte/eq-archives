Actually, we're looking as a guild to start building a specific kill
group for raids--two rogues, puller, wizard, cleric, bard. On some
raids (like ToV,) the puller can eat a LOT of deaths in the course of
an evening and, even after rezzes, lose 1 to 1 1/2 blue by the end of
the night. Giving them a targetted kill group can go a long way to
balancing that out.
