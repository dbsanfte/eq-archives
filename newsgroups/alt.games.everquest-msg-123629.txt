That depends on what Bin Laden is actually after, and his degree of 
rationality. If he wants a Jihad, and is after maximum polarization of the 
issue, "big" attacks against soft targets in the US that necessitate the 
kind of retaliation that he can use for publicity purposes afterwards are 
perhaps his best bet. Bear in mind that probably his short term goals were 
not necessarily against Israel in particular, but simply to increase the 
level of hatred between the Moslem world and the West; hatred off which he 
can feed for money and recruits.

The IRA's strategy was good from a public relations point of view, but it 
can't really be said to have got them closer to a united Ireland than if 
they had never bothered with terrorist actions in the first place.
