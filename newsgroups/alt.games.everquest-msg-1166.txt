I hope no one minds me posting this here, it only deals with one server but
I have never been at one of these events and am excited about this one.  I
spent about an hour last night working my lvl 1 gnome warrior up on defense
skills(10) and alcohol tolerance(20).

On Sunday, February 4th at 4pm Eastern (1pm Pacific), the Steamfront rodents
will be released to cause havoc and mayhem. Tuatha de Danann of the Tribunal
server is sponsoring a few gnomish activities that should prove to be fun
for all of us and annoying for everyone else! I mean, who isn't annoyed by a
gnome?

First event: Classic gnomish g'naked g'newbie run starting at Ak'anon.
Alcohol provided and mandatory (of course), prizes awarded.

Second event: The Gnomish Inquisition. Hosted by our own Kainazzo. Match
wits and beat our quiz master while drunk to win more prizes.

Third event: "Drunken Newbie Test of Tactics". Brawling on the lawn in front
of Ak'anon... need we say more?

Registration:

1. Create a level 1 gnome of whichever class you choose. Remember the third
event so if your friends sign up with you can coordinate class choices. =)

2. IMPORTANT: E-mail me at gnomerun@usa.net with the following information;
the name and class of the gnome you created, as well as the name, level, and
class of your "main" character that will receive any prizes that you might
win. As an option, send me a tell in game to register.

3. Be online with your gnome out in front of Ak'anon by 3:30pm Eastern /
12:30pm Pacific for briefing, debriefing, debuffing, and distrubution of
alcoholic substances. Anyone showing up who did not register via email or
contact me in game will not be allowed to participate.

Prizes are geared for low to mid levels. We have a "cash" pot that will be
divvied up, and a whole lot of items valued upwards of 1000pp! If you have
more than one character, register your lowbie as the character being
represented by your gnome. For added fun, we will not be announcing who is
who until the end.

Good luck!
