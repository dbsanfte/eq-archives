I know that. You didn't read what I said. What I said was that all the
events that have occured throughout the life of EQ have gone on when I can't
play or are zones away and can't get there. I also know they are widely
varying lvls which is why I like to keep chars of all lvls in case an
extended event occurs like they use to have for about a month or so on
Karana with undead invasion in qeynos hills. And so far on ayonae ro, they
have been gm events. I haven't seen or heard of the old "invasion" events
going on. Please stick to what is being said and don't assume you can read
between the lines.
