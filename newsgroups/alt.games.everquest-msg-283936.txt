If the situation is exactly the way you describe (things are running
smoothly, you had the heals covered, but the druid was tossing a big
heal on the tank just as you were CH-ing, druid was only healing /
buffing) then I think you have a real complaint.  Obviuosly CH takes
long enough that the druid has enough time to see it and not cast his
heal.  The druid should have either done that on his own, or done it
after some discussion, or perhaps switched to a lower level heal that
would have saved him some mana and just brought the tank up a bit to
make sure your CH had a chance to land.

My only question is whether there was some mitigating factor.  I can
think of a couple: was there a lot of lag, so the druid might be
missing messages?  Was it a hard LDoN with the tank's health dropping
rapidly?  Had the tank died and the group wiped previously due to a
missed heal?

If none of the above, I agree, the druid should have switched to
offense and trusted you with the heals.  My wife played a druid and
was ok with the healer role but given the opportunity, much preferred
doing damage.  When the cleric when LOM she would pick up healing for
one fight so we could keep moving, and then pass healing back to the
cleric.  She was a high level druid (67 or so) that did some amazing
damage with her dots, so it was well worth it for her to be in the
fight.
