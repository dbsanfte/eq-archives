Have you tried this? I have tested that illusion mask a lot 
and found that it will only raise you about one minor step 
as a dark elf cleric of innoruuk. In other words, once I had
a faction raised to say apprehensive with the mask I was indiff.
It DOES NOT fool people about your diety. You are STILL a cleric
of innoruuk which is MOSTLY why you are kos to those clerics in the
first place. I've not even tried it specifically there though because
you have to have some kind of invis or something to even get in there
to use the mask to then con them since you could even be nearly
aggroing from the entrance, or I guess use the mask right away.
