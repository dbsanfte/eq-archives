You can have gate, when druids get lifetap and can wear plate. =)

Yes definitely, at least some NPC we can go to and question
about how we are doing. We finally got them to list skill levels
maybe this can come next?

I don't think its the movement just the number of trees.
I'd like to be able to have an option to turn down the

Zones like Firiona Vie, warsliks, and the wakening land
are unplayble for me, and I have a decent system 500mhz, 256mb and Voodoo 5.
