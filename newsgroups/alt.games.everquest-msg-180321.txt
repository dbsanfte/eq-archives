I found the best way to raise DW is to put a significantly faster weapon in
the offhand.

For example my Bard

Main hand - Centi short sword - about a 12/25 (or is it 26 ?)

Offhand - Blade of firey lamenations (Sp?) - 5/18

DW was maxed by the time I hit 22 (even with the speed of leveling in PC)
and now keeping DW maxed is easy because I only have to raise it 5 points an
level so I can change to a slower harder hitting weapon.
