Now I got to get a Girlfriend too ? jeez these friggin NG rules, gonna have
to check UNET on that one.

 By the way, I am a cool badass who can troll a newsgroup. What pisses you
off is there is not a thing you can do to change that. "What , I, the Great
Dark Tigger am not in control of this newsgroup ?"

 Yup, Tis' a fact my friend. From the moment one enters this room, you feel
compelled to attack, embarrass, and run them away. You look at it as some
kind of sick victory. Newsflash, I don't get embarrassed, I don't get hurt,
and I don't stand down for no loser like you. I have no feelings and care
even less.  You messed with the wrong person. Biz, Lok, and the others won't
bail ya out this time putz. I am the intruder, I broke your rules, and your
friends have all claimed to KF me. So though you have balls to stay and
fight, you starting to show deterioration and weakness. You make suggestions
on how to improve my life, LOL you starting to care now ?

Get my point nOOb ?

 Go ahead stupid, fck with me some more, I got a lotta time :-)
