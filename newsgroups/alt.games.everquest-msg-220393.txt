So, the whole group quit after the second time he wiped you?

So, you weren't really stuck with him, it just took a bit more to decide to
toss the moron.

I've twice had groups that said "this just isn't working, lets quit before
more deaths happen" when idiots were screwing up.   Toss the offender and go
again.   All you really lose is a bit of time (that you would have lost
dumping him in a normal pickup group too) and a slightly worse rating on the
leaderboard. (I'm sure theres someone, somewhere, who actually cares about
that.)
