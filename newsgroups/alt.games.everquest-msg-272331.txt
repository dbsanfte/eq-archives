True enough, but where isn't that true?

As a guess, any fury/warden using his instant heals and not
his regens without damage shields would be kicked out of
groups pretty quickly.   Whether he has power to also
cast nukes/DoTs and whether it's better to save the power
for heals as compared to killing the mob(s) faster is up
to the player, same as always.

After a certain point, any class -- EQ or EQ2 -- that
doesn't play in a *semi*-optimal way will be shunned.
Yes, there will be an "optimum" way to play your class
(based on challenging encounters anyway) when "your
best" matters.   I'm not sure how you avoid it.
