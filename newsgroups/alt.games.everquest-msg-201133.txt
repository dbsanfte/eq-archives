    Should be interesting to see what the changes are like this time, after
the mess that was last time.

    Should more closely match the intent? Heh, I guess that means they
aren't sticking to the promises made in the first patch message. After all,
it was actually generous to players!

    Balderdash. Smaller groups actually suffered a penalty to XP versus the
old system, and it was specifically mentioned that no group of two or more
players would get less XP than under the old system.

    They're never going to balance this correctly and maintain the internal
balance of previous expansions, for one simple reason: mobs aren't uniformly
tough across a level range. A level 55 Sentinel in Velk's has a lower ATK
and lower max hit than a level 55 mob in PoP. Unless that changes, players
will just go to the weakest level 55 mob they can find.

    Oh, and the "barely hurt their attackers" also is hardcoded in from when
the level limit was raised to 65. So extending the XP range down five levels
will of course lead to players farming low blues for fast XP, unless they
are given an XP penalty which defeats the whole point of turning them from
light blue to blue.

    And that's ANOTHER thing that bugs me in PoP. One puller, running out to
get the next mob for a raid, can reduce the amount of raid XP given out to
zero for the entire raid because he's "out of range". You've nerfed raid XP
badly enough that nobody would seriously use it to PL a character or set up
"zonewide raids", and it's going to be nerfed even more when the XP changes
with PoP ZEM reductions goes in, so could you please get rid of the freaking
range restriction?
