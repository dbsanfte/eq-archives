Yep. D&D, a single game, basically launched RPGs, and CRPGs, which launched
MMOGs. MTG launched... possibly 2 games. I think the percentages matter
because I think 0.01 % is very optomistic.

The example given was that a racing car driver would be given a faster car
if he paid more. Maybe you are not talking about the example given because
it isn't convenient to your argument? It is certainly a rule change
benefitting richer players. If you don't want to discuss the topic, fine,
but before you go, read the original post because that is the subject,
regardless of how many times you try to hijack this discussion into another
direction.

In which case you are talking about something different to what this
discussion is about. Re-read the starting post. The question was how did
people feel about the extension of a new policy that was announced (with the
example given of a car racing game) of better equipment to those who pay
more to MMOG/s. The company that was announcing this new policy wasn't
talking about a single game, and the extension in the original post was
certainly not.

Bad luck if they are invested emotionally in a game?  If they've played for
ages, and then is brought in, for example? I know the anger people felt over
small changes in everquest that were perceived to disadvantage them, to the
point where they refused to play anything by SOE again. A lot of people were
only marginally loyal to EQ2 and swapped to WOW because of bad experiences
over years with EQ1. The thing is, they suffered for years, because it
wasn't as easy as throwing in a hand of poker. People care about their
characters, which is why they play the games for so long... and why they can
even get violent over them.

I'd like to see the reaction if you went to an EQ convention, announced that
a rules change was coming in that meant only rich people would get to the
upper levels, and told everyone if they didn't like it, they could always go
elsewhere. This isn't like a change of coffee flavour at Starbucks!

So if they want to play MMOGs with Americans, they'll have to play the
peasants to your Prince? How wonderfully imperialist of you.

Actually, i think accusing MS of being a greedy multinational is fairly
distant from a rabid accusation. It sounds suspiciously like what several
judges have declared, or were they rabid as well? Perhaps the whole EU is
bonkers for claiming MS is greedy in it's behaviour? I'm not accusing them
of eating babies, I'm saying that they and many other companies have poor
track records where it comes to honesty and like to slip in extra charges
where they can, which is exactly what would happen if you bought a car
racing game which was not advertised as requiring anything above the base
cost to play, and yet once you'd gotten past the first few levels you found
them making the game harder unless you pony up for a faster car...
