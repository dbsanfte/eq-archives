One of the best chanters on Prexus (subjective of course..) didn't always
use the number 1 haste.

From the early levels to the high 50's (AQ over WR), if you refused to group
with him because of that, then you'd be the one losing out not him.  Trust
me on that.

I hate to come across with "the uber elitist attitude" as some would call
it, but seriously.. you're level 51.  You don't know half there is to know
about you're OWN class, let alone others.  You aren't even half way to the
highest level, you know fuck all about high end tactics, successful
combinations, most if not all other classes from 1 to 60, yet you're
repeatedly dictating to others what they must and must not have, what they
must and must not cast - who the fuck are you to tell *ANYBODY* what they
do?   What the fuck experience and knowledge do you have in the 50+ game to
tell others that an approach they do is wrong, that it won't work?
