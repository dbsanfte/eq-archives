I ignore d00dspeak requests usually. Sometimes I'll say no and even
tell them why I'm saying no - they usually don't get it which is why I
usually don't bother. If someone takes the time to type out a polite
request usualy at least an attempt at proper english, they get what
they ask for. Someone who takes the time to roleplay the request gets
their requested buf plus whatever else I can throw at them. Really
makes someone's day when they scratch behind my druid's wolf-formed
ear and say "Kind druid, could you please bestow wolf's feet on me?"
and they walk away with SOW, SLN, Chloro, and thorns.
