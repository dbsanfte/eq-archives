Hi All;

I'm wanting to get one of these and it says it has 5 charges. What I can't
find is how do you recharge one of these?  I'm a Cleric and this would be
very convenient. Right now I have to carry some non-stacking Cloudy Potions.

Also;  I'm looking for a levitate item that could be re-charged by a Cleric.

I have zero in tradeskills. I have not yet developed a desire to start on
any trade skills. So, finding an invisible item and a levitate item that I
could re-charge without skills would be great.

Any and all suggests would be most appreciated.

Thanks in advance for you time.
