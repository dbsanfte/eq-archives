By the time you get VOG your tanks will already have haste items and the
extra haste of WR won't give them nearly as much as the other benefits of
VOG.

I have yet to cast WR on anyone (been level 60 since September).  I do use
my li'l clicky uberbuff on folks though...but that's just to save a slot or
mana.
