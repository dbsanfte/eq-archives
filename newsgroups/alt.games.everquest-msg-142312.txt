Gee, and here you were criticizing me for knee-jerk insults directed
at your statement. Now you turn around and take knee-jerk insults
directed at *ME*. Here's a dictionary, why don't you go look up the
word "hypocrite".

Sorry, bub. I'm saying shamans/druids are closer to clerics than
paladins. You're saying paladins are closer to clerics than
druids/shamans. IF that's NOT what you're saying, then you're doing an
abysmal job at communicating it. Either way, I'm done arguing with a
brick wall. Maybe when you come up with some clue how to get your
point across clearly rather than strutting around doing some kind of
Superior Dance, we can work this out. Til then, don't bother.
