   I used to spend time in alt.sex.masturbation, but
then it got taken over by the spambots and all the
regulars at the time, about two years ago or so, 
stopped posting.  Damned shame, it was a fun little
troop.
   Unfortunately, I don't know enough about any other
sex topics to post intelligently on them, unless 
there is a group called alt.sex.married.boring or
something similar that I missed.

Annie  <--- Could also make friends in alt.sex.celibacy,
            if it existed.
