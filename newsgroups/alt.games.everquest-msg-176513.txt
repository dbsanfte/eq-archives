prophet - (prof'it) one called by God to speak for him or who speaks by =
divine inspiration. A Hebrew prophet was less one who predicted future =
events than one who spoke out plainly what he felt the will of God to =
be, now or in the future, in the life of the nation or of an individual. =
They dared to speak up to kings and religious leaders.

1Cor.14
[1] Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye =
may prophesy.

[2] For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but =
unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he =
speaketh mysteries.

[3] But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and =
exhortation, and comfort.


[4] He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that =
prophesieth edifieth the church.

[5] I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye =
prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh =
with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.

[6] Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall =
I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by =
knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?

[7] And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, =
except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what =
is piped or harped?

[8] For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare =
himself to the battle?

[9] So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be =
understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak =
into the air.

[10] There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and =
none of them is without signification.

[11] Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto =
him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian =
unto me.

[12] Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek =
that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

[13] Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he =
may interpret.

[14] For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my =
understanding is unfruitful.

[15] What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with =
the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing =
with the understanding also.

[16] Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that =
occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, =
seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?

[17] For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.

[18] I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:

[19] Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my =
understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten =
thousand words in an unknown tongue.

[20] Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye =
children, but in understanding be men.

[21] In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips =
will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear =
me, saith the Lord.

[22] Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to =
them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe =
not, but for them which believe.

[23] If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and =
all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or =
unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?

[24] But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or =
one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:

[25] And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling =
down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a =
truth.

[26] How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, everyone of you =
hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an =
interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.

[27] If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the =
most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.

[28] But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; =
and let him speak to himself, and to God.

[29] Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

[30] If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first =
hold his peace.

[31] For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may =
be comforted.

[32] And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

[33] For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all =
churches of the saints.

[34] Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not =
permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under =
obedience, as also saith the law.

[35] And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at =
home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

[36] What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?

[37] If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him =
acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments =
of the Lord.

[38] But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

[39] Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak =
with tongues.

[40] Let all things be done decently and in order.
