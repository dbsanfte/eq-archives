I like kei, although i haven't had to pay for it yet. I usually get it cast
at me as payment for a port. I hate beggars, and wish people wouldn't
encourage them.. it's like feeding bears donuts, it only makes them fat,
aggressive and dangerous. If someone says sow plz or asks for free ports,
they will be put on my ignore list if they don't donate something (it's too
easy to make a few plat for a young char, considering the silk swatch
market). I didn't demand free buffing from to other people and amazed that
people expect it from me.

So I'm anon, in wc, medding after a luclin port (twice the normal mana cost,
same payment as everywhere else, alas!) and i get soo tired of being
harassed, and this newbie runs at me yapping for skins chlor sow now plz!
and gets eaten by some kodiaks. Didn't anyone warn him not to feed to feed
the bears?
