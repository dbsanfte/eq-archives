And I believe that folks who have this opinion belong on a No Rez For Joo
list.

cleric epic = good.

I got so disgusted with this, I've given up all hope of ever having an epic
for Tiru, and shelved him. Fortunately, Tarre the necro is more fun to play.
She may not have a realistic shot at her epic either, but gosh, it's NOT
bottlenecked like that. Just lots and lots of really rare drops, in places I
don't get to hunt often.
