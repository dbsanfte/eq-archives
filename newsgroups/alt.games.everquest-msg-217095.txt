Right.

    First reference to "through the wall".

    Second reference to "through the wall".

    This time, we're even clarifying it. "...behind the wall, where you
can't see them." And a door is mentioned, leading even the densest poster to
realize "hey, that ain't the same room he's talkin' 'bout!"

    Of course, you can't do this to see into another room. In another branch
of this thread, you reveal that you thought:

    It wouldn't be the first thing you've gotten wrong in this thread.

    And thank you for shopping on E-Bay! I say this because, in my previous
post, I pointed out all the things you didn't know about a cleric's buffs.
You know, that stuff you snipped because it made you look like even more of
a numbskull?
