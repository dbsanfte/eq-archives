ï¿½nder Options-Keyboard there are 2 entries for user
defined cameras.
I navigate with direction keys,user cameras are bound to
home and end just above the direction keys,first person
view to scroll,so I can switch views without stopping to run 
and navigate.
Now it would be nice ,if the camera angles wouldnt change
all the time,this really sucks.
