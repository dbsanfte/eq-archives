Found this on the web site for the CT server:

==============================
From Absor on the Developer's Corner:

We forgot to include a comment in the patch message about the removal of the
10% healing penalty for non-clerics. The penalty was indeed removed with
this patch.

Also, while we've included the new 'old-world' Vah Shir models in the patch,
you won't be able to turn them on yet. We'll have to patch another file to
allow you to choose to turn them off in the interface. That should happen
soon.

Thanks.

Alan

================================

Hmmmm ... the thing about the Vah Shir models is interesting.  Why advertise
it with this patch, one wonders, if it can't be turned on?
