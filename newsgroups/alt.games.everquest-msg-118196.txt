Yes, our shaman made a big difference.  The oozes & lizards we fought
are not very magic resistant, so he had no trouble slowing them even
though they conned white/yellow to him.  I did need to be ready to heal
him quickly though, definitely a Divine Light situation :)

The only time we came close to having a problem was when our SK went
linkdead - we were able to keep up with the ooze spawns, but it was a
little touch & go.
