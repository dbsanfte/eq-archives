 I like doing HS without a Rogue. But it's not really possible unless
they changed the spawn rate on the named. Nobody should have to camp 4
hours for the next wing key. In my opinion it should be a ground spawn
at the end of each wing on maybe a 2 hour spawn or something. I haven't
been there for awhile but it's easier just to bring a rogue and head to
the South wing. Which is sad since HS is a fun place to do the crawl
through. Sadly, Verant missed the mark just a little.
