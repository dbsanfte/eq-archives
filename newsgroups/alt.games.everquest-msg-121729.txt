Sorry, not everyone in the US loves good movies...

Hell, I know I don't. There is a big difference between a good movie and an 
entertaining movie, and I go to the movies (when I go, which isn't very 
often at all... twelve years in the industry rather burned me out) is 
purely for entertainment. When I want enlightenment, I read a book, or 
listen to classical music.

Anyway, back on the topic, I think I'm with Tyger on this one. I doubt that 
more than one person in ten has heard of Akira Kurosawa in the US. I'm 
willing to extend this to perhaps three out of ten when it comes to EQ 
players, because of the increased nerd factor, but that's about it.
