Actually, the guard is ALWAYS in the water.

There are two fish in the pool.  Each follows a different path, and
both do spend a good amount of time near the guard, but both also
wander out beyond the guard's range, and that's when you should attack
them.  In fact, it won't be long before your "fish mule" is KoS, and
the fish will attack you on their own.

Just keep your mule in the eastern end of the pool (away from the
guard), a little south of the "stairs" that lead in/out of the pool.
Then edge west a little bit at a time, no more than necessary,
until you can see the fish as they make the easternmost swings of
their rounds.  One of them does this right along the south wall
of the pool, the other one does it a bit farther north, close
to the N/S coordinate of the stairs.

After a bit of practice, you should be able to do this safely.
Just bind on the "sidewalk" on the south side of the pool, so
if you die you can just jump in and try again.  Do NOT bind
near the NPCs on the east/north sides of the pool, because
after a few fish you'll be KoS and they'll jump you on sight.
