Lol, that sounds like something out of a daffy duck cartoon. :)

Sounds like something I won't be doing by accident, then, that's good.

Hey, PCs have volume too... could you make a human (or gnomish. :) ) 
pyramid, then take out the bottom floor like that?

As for squeezing through walls and ceilings being an exploit... What about 
wiggling in the entrance of the hole to avoid having a rogue or a key?

The place it always used to happen to me was when attempting to board 
boats while too faction-challenged to use the dock, so you end up 
swimming through the hull.  Exploit or no?

How can we characterize the difference between these two, assuming they're 
all right, and squeezing through the ceiling to a remote locked area, 
which does seem obviously bad.
