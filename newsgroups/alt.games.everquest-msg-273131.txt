No, I did not.  DT is always instant death.  Kerafyrm DTs frequently.  
The only way to beat him was a massive zerg rez fest.  The question is, 
what cures this spell?  If it's reasonably curable, then it is 
overcomable, so long as it's not being constantly cast, ie, it gets cast 
once a minute, or something on that order.  Since I cannot actually look 
up the details at the moment, I don't know the answers to these 
questions.
