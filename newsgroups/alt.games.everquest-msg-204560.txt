Hi,

Our Druid and Pally combo have been fighting in Burning woods for several
levels but at 49 MOB's are begining to go light blue one us. Looking to move to
another area where the mobs wikll be a bit higher and interested in knowing of
any places in them where we can park and be free of wandering Mobs?

Thanks in advance for any info
