Here's the ugly truth about wizards:  Nukes are the worst possible way
to kill something in this game.  It incurrs the highest downtime of
all the different ways to generate damage.  Even the most efficient
AoE groups can't keep up with the damage output of a melee heavy
group.

Every other caster class has support spells that help increase the
effectiveness of melee damage.  Wizards are the only class that does
not.

This is why wizards are probably the least useful class in any serious
exp grind.

Of course, the real ugly part is at level 60 they suddenly become damn
near essential again.  Dragon/Giant Bane spells are INCREDIBLY useful
in the end game encounters.  Why?  Because in the end game encounters,
downtime resulting from the fight isn't exactly your biggest concern.
