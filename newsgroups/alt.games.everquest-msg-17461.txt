I keep killing this guy outside of Qeynos called Jacrol Bisset or something
like that. Everytime he dies he says something about some mccabe or cabe
person getting revenge for him. Can anyone tell me who this cabe or mccabe
guy is so I will know to watch out or maybe hunt him as well. :) Sorry about
the spelling on the names.

Thanks,

Joseph
