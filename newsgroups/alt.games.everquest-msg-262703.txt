There is a pattern...I will try to remember...

Times are in-game times:

6AM Spawn (don't kill)
10AM Despawn/Respawn (kill)
7pm Spawn (kill)

This gives you 3 shots per game day instead of 2 if you kill the
placeholder every time it pops. That may not be the exact times, but
the patter is correct.

I hope your luck is better than mine. 32 total hours (2x16 hour
camps), and 96 place holders to get Raster. After getting the robe,
and reading about the hassles getting the pipes for the next step, I
parked my monk and never went back.
