    Elsewhere someone confirmed that will be the case, which sounds really
neat.

    That's only part of the story. 8)  Ever since a few massive tradeskill
flops, the model for adding tradeskill content to the game has been to add
it, test that it's in, then drop hints (either a scroll in game, or pure
out-of-game suggestion like with Eggnog). Wu's Armour was discovered right
after it had been put in game but before it had been tested and the scrolls
put in purely by chance. If you want a recipe found only through
experimentation, use Eggnog as an example.

    Again, the hints are out there when a recipe is added. They may be
cryptic ("the Root Beer Float is in game"), they may be in a very
out-of-the-way place (scrolls in Mistmoore?), but they're there.
