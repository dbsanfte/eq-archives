Ah, apparently you haven't visited this newsgroup before, or you'd know that
I pull agro on purpose in some situations because I like to tank at times
and have relatively high AC for a druid.  One of my best RL friends plays a
warrior on dorf/dragon faction, and I regularly chastise him for being too
lazy to make a Thurg gate potion.  The most recent situation is that he was
camped at the zone in to Chardok and wanted to get to WC to give a bunch of
stuff to his newbie druid alt, he couldn't get a port in-zone, and the way
to the zone out had 2 out of 3 royals standing there (raid wiped with buggy
pull), so he calls me on the phone to ask if he can log me on his second
computer and port him out, ummm... no, I'm camped in the middle of CoM and
my bind spot is in Everfrost.  Easy fix here? HAVE A FUCKING THURG POTION
SIR (a cheap vendor bought invis potion is also very useful)

Yeah, 20 out of 24 people level 46-52 are on giant faction, that would also
make them idiots, since they don't have a chance in hell of getting WToV
armor besides paying obscene sums for it.  And I did take as many people out
as I could, but considering that my bind point was on the ass end of the
moon, I have every right to refuse a bunch of people that I've known for
*maybe* 3 hours.

Hi, we have 2 bards in 4 groups, thank you, please wipe the drool off of
your chin; not to mention that most 46-52 players aren't exactly rolling in
the resist gear.

You're thinking of Lokari's situation.

MY situation was; we killed Vox, maybe 6-8 deaths out of 24 people (none in
my group and the MA survived, thanks to my spot heals and my high enough
resists to run through dragon breath a bunch) rolled loot, and were getting
ready to leave when 20 people shout "druid is binding here to port us all
out right?", to which my reply was "Ahem, it's *my* bind point sirs" (yes,
they said, "*druid* is binding here..?", I have a name you dimwits)

Oh, and I didn't bind, I ported a group out and went on my way.
