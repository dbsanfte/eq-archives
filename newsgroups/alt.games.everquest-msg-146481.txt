Had a druid claim all the blood gill spawns. Tried to explain it to
him, told him if he wanted to petition me go ahead, he just whined and
moaned and wouldn't petition me, he knew damn well he was on shaky
ground. I moved on but not before I /petitioned Junglejoe for having
an improper name and the GM agreed it was. :-P

If you want to be a dick, make sure your shit is wound tight because I
will take a long look at you and see what I can get you on. :-)
