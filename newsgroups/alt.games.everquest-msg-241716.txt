To be perfectly clear -- we are talking about a L65 HARD mission, not
normal.  If you say you can do four (unmezzed?) mobs at once in a HARD
mission I guess I have to say thats nice.  But that certainly is as
far from the norm as you can get.

Most groups I have been in cannot take more than one at a time in a 65
hard mission.  Two incoming at once and someone usually dies.  Deaths
slow the group down.  Three incoming at once and the group usually
wipes.  There have been exceptions, but that is the rule.  My job as
puller is to evaluate the groups strength and pull as fast as they can
take it.  In hard missions that usually means chain pulling singles as
much as possible.  A longer runway makes that possible.  Sow makes
that quicker.
