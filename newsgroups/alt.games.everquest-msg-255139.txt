I said it would help, but isnt needed.  Better gear IS needed on raids.  You
seem to have it backwards.  I could give examples but there is no point, to
anyone aside from you it is plainly obvious.

I would never have someone like you on any of my raids, you sound like a
slacker who bums his way through EQ, relying on others effort to get you
through, I may be wrong but that is how your line of thinking comes across
to me.

Bazaar gear is more than enough for most people, topped up with LDoN gear,
that is all most people NEED.

Yes, because farming spiderlings is the only thing to do solo, how wrong I
am.

Just because you are unimaginative while soloing, does not mean everyone is.

Whats interesting to one person is boring to another, stale, one man LDoN
dungeons are about one of the most boring things I can imagine, zone in, hit
track, fight to named, zone out, what fun (or maybe even do the
inspirational missions they give!)  The duo idea, is more interesting.

Also, way to go on basing a whole paragraph around a FEW examples.

And what reasons are there that soloers should get gear as good as raiders,
forgetting that they dont NEED it.

> Raiders are not better players, nor are they more skilled. In fact
> people who solo, and group are often more adept when facing challenges.

Yes, because no raider ever solos or groups.  Most ways of soloing are easy
and safe, they have to be, as you are solo.

Generalising people like that is bad.

I solo a fair amount, I group alot, I raid a fair amount, each of these
contributes to how good I am as a player, each situation requires you to be
aware in different ways, different skills are needed for different
situations.  A pure solo player would likely wipe a raid, for example.

> The only thing the average raider can do is:

There is no such thing as an average raider, you love to generalise dont
you.

>
> 1) Show up often and on demand.

Putting time in, working with a team towards a goal.

> 2) Follow instructions.

If you havent raided there before sure.  When you group do you not follow /
give instructions?  A raid is a very large group, that is all.

Raids are generally more hostile enviroments than most solo / group content.

Wow, any raider is just a sheep.  None of these people have their own minds
or opinions? Would like to meet that raid, must be easy to run.

I can tell you now, to save you the hassle.

It is because that is how the game designers wanted it to be.  And
(thankfully) that looks like how they intend it to be for the future.
