How long have you played EQ?  What level is your highest character?  I find
your conclusion to be based on absolutely nothing.

A pally in a group will have all those skills maxed AND know what /assist
means.  AND will know to surround a critter so it doesn't jump off a cliff
somewhere.  AND will know that LoHing the enchanter or cleric will almost
always be more important than LoHing him/herself...and will think nothing of
dying to keep those others (who are 95%+ of the time more important than
him) alive.
