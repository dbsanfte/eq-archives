Give it time.  For now, there are KEI potions, sort of.  (The potions
don't last as long, and don't give increased mana pool or wis/int, but
just the mana regen.  And I think you have to be level 65 to use the
potion that actually gives as much mana regen as KEI, but hey, it's
close. :-)

I actually like the new potions.  They're a bit too expensive for me to
use regularly, which is fine by me.  But for when I really need some
extra mana (and I either didn't get a KEI to start, or have lost it due
to dying, or whatever), it's nice to have the option.  And just this
week my monk hastily handed over one of the new HoT potions to a party
member who was on the verge of dying to a DoT.  I like having options
like that available.

Mis-remembering, I'd say.  My characters have all started out at best
apprehensive and usually dubious in Shadow Haven, and even after doing
the errand quest to boost it, I still need to sneak behind the merchants
to deal with them unless I'm wearing the Amulet of the Haven or whatever
the reward from that quest is called.  (And even that isn't always
enough, as I recall, which is why I usually just leave the amulet in the
bank and go sneak.)
