Ah, I saw that on another thread.   Was thinking that this was referring to a
different raid.

Here is our general strategy for Hate.

http://arbiters.econfcall.org/forum/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=&TOPIC_ID=20

Essentially what we do is have the groups port up one at a time, and run
around the edge of the zone to camp.   The camp is at a relatively safe point.
No static spawns are there, and nothing wanders past.  Due to going the long
way around the zone, the raid force will get there mainly intact, unless
someone does something stupid, like train a mob to camp.   The rogues drag in
the unlucky ones from the run to camp and we get started pulling.

Every raid, both guild and public that I have been on has done it this way.
(granted I've only been raiding for about 6 months or so)  One raid used the
same strategy, but ran the opposite way to camp.  Faster trip, but more deaths
since a patrol route goes along the south wall.

I suppose you could have a couple of groups run along the wall ahead of your
main force, clearing the path...  it might save a few deaths, but that seems
time consuming, and ultimately unnecessary.  Dangerous as well, if you aggro
one of the buildings, or worse, the second floor.
