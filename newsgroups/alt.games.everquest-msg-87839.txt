/agree

Are there any recorded incidents of someone being banned or suspended
for "disagreeing" with a Guide/GM that didn't curse, insult, or
verbally abuse said Guide or GM?

I have never personally seen or heard from a direct source of any
player banned or suspended for disagreeing or telling a GM they think
the decision stinks.

Most people (especially those safely hidden by the anonymity of the
Internet) turn into whiney, abusive, and vulgar spoiled brats when
told "No" by a GM or Guide. All you have to do is read the latest "GMS
SUXXOR" thread, and you can tell exactly why the fool got his arse
kicked. If they used even 10% of the vulgarity or whiney abusive
language they put into their post to a GMs face, they deserve what
they got,
