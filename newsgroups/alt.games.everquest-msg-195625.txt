Nope, still don't see it.  Not easier, just more mobs dead.  Maybe in a
certain situation you saying that it might lower the odds of having respawn
when OOM, meaning that you wernt watching the clock & got a suprise.  So
with C3 you "might" still have mana to handle the fight.  How does this
"vastly" easier?
