Yeah, altho is was about to happen. It might bring a little more cash now
with the bazaar and people need a quick port up to secure an item a buddy
has seen on there.
No more waiting for 5-10 mins at the Spires and hoping someone else doesn't
see the deal at the Bazaar, which has happend to me a few times.

For me its a welcomed addition to the port list. I wonder at what lvls these
ports are available. Hope atleast Nexus at 29 and DS at 34 since thats my
new hunting ground.
