Cleric costs are *very* high...especially for whiny tanks that
*NNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDD* Marzin and won't settle for mana/dot
savers like Naltron's Mark. Especially in a place like Seb, where 90%
of the mobs are cake, this pissed me off to no end..

That said, however, when I was leveling up in places like Seb, etc, I
would take what I spent plus a bit, for cost, then return the rest of
the gems to the group. For every nice group that hands out gems for
dot costs, there is 3 that don't.

Bottom line, I agree that particular cleric is making out like a
bandit, but for other clerics, don't be too nitpicky unless there is a
pattern, its nice to have cash to spend on things other than dots from
time to time -- and it's even nicer to not take a loss on them as,
sadly, happens way too often..
