I started out as a magician, but once i got to lvl 4 I gave up because I
found out I needed components that I couldnt seem to find. now im a wizard
and it seemed fun until i looked all over the wiz guild and couldnt find
where the h*ll they sell spells. someone plz tell me where to find wiz
spells, where to get components for mages (oh yeah, forgot to say i am in
felwithe) and please give your opinions on which class is best. i was
thinking of being a warrior, but having no spells turned me off on that
idea. someone please help!
