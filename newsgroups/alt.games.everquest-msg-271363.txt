Yes, forgot to mention them, they certainly can solo, but not as 
effectively as a number of other classes as far as xp/hour goes.

Bards, necros, enchanters, druids,wizards and shaman can all do better 
than that.  I am not sure how fast Beastlords can get AAXP soloing off 
hand.  Bards are probably the single best soloers as far as xp/hour goes, 
given a talented bard with a good connection.  At level 65, I could 
easily solo my shaman getting an AA in 90 minutes or less in fire.  I 
expect it's a bit slower now, as with added levels, the xp bonus for high 
level mobs is reduced soloing in the same spot, OTOH, I can probably kill 
any individual mob somewhat faster now than then as well, so it might 
balance out.
