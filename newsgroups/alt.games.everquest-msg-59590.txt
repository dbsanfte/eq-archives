Sure, most epics are crap compared to what's coming out of ToVN.  My
twinkie using SoD + Frostbringer was able to out taunt a warrior 2
levels higher than me with his epic.  14/24 really can't compare to
ToVN/ST loot (and the Frostbringer is common as hell these days,
scrape up 15k and you can buy one).

How about a druid breaking 1200AC, 150 resists across the board and
255+ WIS?  :)

Had someone told me this was possible pre-Velious, I would have
laughed in their face.
