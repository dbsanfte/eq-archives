Post-40, Powerleveling is really more like creative grouping.

places to go:
Skyfire, Cobalt Scar, Siren's Grotto (there's a single spawn walrus-thing
down in the depths somewhere),

or just go group your bard, um, ANYWHERE.  Bard's are a highly valued group
member as long as the group isn't composed of a bunch of idiots who think
all you need is a warrior, a cleric and an enchanter; unless the group has a
bard already, in which case another is nice, but you start to hit the point
of diminishing returns.
