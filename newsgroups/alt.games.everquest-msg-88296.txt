I think its just a case of stress relief. I sure hope people do not think
any NG is reality in any sense. I do however see many a user posting in here
all day. I am not concerned because unemployment is up, and they need
something to do. God knows wouldn't wanna waste that good NG time to find a
job.
Anyway, I come home from a long day, and I have two choices. (again with the
choices)

 I can beat my dog,
Or I can piss off Lokari.

Hell, I like my dog.

 Your analysis is very enlightening and not too far from being accurate. But
I have seen you in a few Newsgroups and you are well versed. Me ?  I do not
live my life based on Newsgroup tells, opinions, and analogies. I post
negativity when it is earned, and thus end up psyched up for some EQ action.
It serves its purpose. I was called a Troll earlier and I think it was meant
to insult me or something. If a Troll it is, then so be it. I am here for
me, and only me. I am satisfied :-)

GetsumJ "The Troll" LOL
