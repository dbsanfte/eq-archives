    We're over 130 Emp keys, and only got one silk bridle. It's quite rare,
but you can get one. To put the drop percentage in perspective, we've also
gotten one Cobalt Helm off one of those snakes that drop the Insignia for
the key in the same time period. ;-) (Early in SoL, there was a bug in drop
tables that allowed some mobs to have Cobalt Helms. We even saw one on a
guard in The Bazaar once.)
