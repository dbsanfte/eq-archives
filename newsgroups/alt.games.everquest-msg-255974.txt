Not being elemental, I have not seriously looked at what elemental gear 
has.  I had been of the understanding that LDoN is comparable to 
tradeskilled elemental, not as good as ornate drops.  As for comparing it 
to Ornate, some pieces of LDoN are better, some are not from a caster 
point of view due to foci.

The big difference in the augment slots is the type of slots available.  
LDoN gear usually has 3 slots that will accept better, and usually 
cheaper augments than dropped gear, unless you are getting your augments 
as drops in GoD.  As for the mana pool, I agree completely, I never much 
worried about what my mana pool was, just my mana throughput.

Can't access the information here, but, I believe for at least some melee 
classes, LDoN fully augmented weapons are at least pre elemental PoP 
quality, and better than just about any, if not all droppable weapons.

Beats the heck out of me how that slot 1 works, have not tried to put 
anything in one yet.
