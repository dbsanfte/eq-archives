I know we're very short on ToV plate BPs.  I think all other classes
are completely decked out, other than one or two pieces on a new
initiate.  For some reason plate BPs just don't drop very often off
anything other than a named for us.

Hmmm, SS stuff is lower AC, but higher stats compared to Kael, right?
I would think they would be pretty similar, but I just always go for
more AC (or STA), and I have enough trouble knowing bard gear, can't
be bothered to memorize other-factioned cleric gear.  I *think* it can
be worn by War, Bard, Pally, SK, & Cleric, but I may be mistaken.
