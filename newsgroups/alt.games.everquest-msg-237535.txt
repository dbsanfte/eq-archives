This subject is very difficult for me to discuss, especially with nothing
more than a layman's grasp of the science involved.  In a nutshell, I
don't believe in effect without cause.  This means, in a godless universe,
the universe must exist forever going backwards in time; i.e., there can
be no point in time where you can't go back because otherwise you have a
chicken and egg problem with the beginning of the universe vs. cause and
effect.  But then you end up with the same paradoxical problem except it's
applied to infinity instead: you follow causes & effects backwards farther
and farther and farther into eternity...it almost seems like a lame excuse
to me, almost like smoke & mirrors to describe something not possible.

I know I'm not doing the subject justice, but I'm trying.  :-(

On the subject of God, I can only conclude the logic is beyond our ability
to understand.
