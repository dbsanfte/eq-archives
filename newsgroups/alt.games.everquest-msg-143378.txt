I installed the latest VIA drivers available at the Asus site, version 4.37.

I put the latest BIOS in now. I was using 1007 and Asus had a 1011 version 
available.

Windows shows the same as what Sandra reported. The BIOS shows this information:

N/A:
Input Device

IRQ 5:
Serial Bus Controller
Serial Bus Controller

IRQ 10:
Multimedia Device
Serial Bus Controller
Serial Bus Controller

IRQ 11:
Serial Bus Controller
Network Controller
Display Controller

IRQ 12:
Mass Storage Controller
Serial Bus Controller
Multimedia Device

IRQ 14/15:
IDE Controller

I've now disabled the firewire controller. How do I know which devices are using 
that USB controller? I have four USB slots on my computer and three are being 
used (one of which goes to a USB hub).

I would assume it's using the VIA controller since I don't have anything plugged 
in to the Promise IDE slots. I'll disable it to see what happens.

Yep, indeed it does. Maybe Sandra is acting screwy since it's not installed on my 
system. I simply ran its executable from folder on my original hard drive (which 
is just my entire old HD in a folder on the new drive).

I didn't see any references to ACPI in my BIOS, I thought I checked all the 
spots. Maybe it's hidden somewhere I didn't see. If it requires an OS reinstall 
I'd rather not have to do that then unless there's a way to reinstall without 
formatting.

I seem to notice a link that causes more crashes than anything else. Previously I 
mentioned that they become greatly more frequent when I use FrontPage. Rather 
than update some files on my site through that program I instead just used 
Notepad and such. Also I was saving pictures to my FTP drive from Paint Shop Pro 
as well. Pretty soon I encountered a crash with BAD_POOL_CALLER. I can use PSP or 
Notepad fine at other times, and I now believe FrontPage would work fine at other 
times. The link between what I was doing is an Explorer integrated program I use 
from KnoWare called Internet Neighborhood. It's an FTP program and one of the 
features is FTP site drive mapping. I have my webspace FTP site as my X:. I can 
read and write to and from the site from within any program, they simply see the 
X: as a regular drive. I am unsure how this would cause many problems, but it 
seems it could be since that's the only link I see between working on my webpage 
from within Notepad or from within FrontPage, or reading/writing from within 
Paint Shop Pro.
