Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Hang on while I catch my breath...

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Sorry. I think I've got it this time..

Hahahahah.

Whew.

As a 55/51 myself, I have about negative 2k in the bank. Hell, I'm
betting my whole guild, of which my 55 is one of the lowest level
mains, would be able to scrounge up *maybe* 50k total. I don't know
*who* has 200-300k "rotting in the bank," but it's certainly not
anyone I play with.

When I bought my Fungal Growth Tunic it was after buying nothing but
food and peridots for over a month, saving every plat I got, looting
and selling a Crystallized Short Sword, Lamentation, Sarnak Battle
Shield, and more than a dozen lesser items, then negotiating long and
hard to get one at 32k plus a handful of 55+ spells. The fungal is the
most expensive item I ever bought in EQ, before or since. If I'd
gotten it and subsequently been unable to use it after all of that, I
would have been deeply displeased.

I wouldn't call someone an asshole for earning more plat than me or
for getting screwed when an item they bought turned out not to work as
advertised. I probably would call someone an asshole for assuming that
anyone who plays the game differently from their own preference "gets
what they deserve" when they get screwed.
