First Question. Why?
Second Question. Couldn't SOE find anyone with a clue to do them?

They really suck on Elves (Wood and Dark, haven't checked out High yet) Your
character stoops over at the waste and swings their arms in front of their
stooped bodies.

Just to add...yes High and Half Elves look stupid too...

I really hope a different animation team is programming...well...EVERYTHING
else for SOE.

"but we think you'll like the changes."

OMG did the person that wrote the message watch the animations?

I haven't been able to hunt all night...I am too embarrassed to move out of
the Nexus in case anyone sees me.

Ok, it's a minor point to rant about but please, SOE, if you are gonna
"improve" something you really should actually make it better.
