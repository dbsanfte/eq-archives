Strategy? Stroll through Upper Guk without touching the froggies. Get
the camp (might have to wait in line)
Wait for spawn: root, dot, snare (if root breaks when at low health
and the crocs aren't snared, they will run into the wall and then come
swimming back a while later unless they die from a dot. I remember
chasing the AC quite far down the corridors after he pathed into the
wall - I was there before snare and root stacked)
The saltwater crocodiles (placeholders) spawn up to 4 at a time but
are not social, so you can just take them out one at a time as long as
you don't walk into the aggro range of the other crocodiles.
Practice swimming, divination, any neglected casting skills in between
spawns - they're on an 18 minute timer. Most or all of the
placeholders will still be blue at 35.
