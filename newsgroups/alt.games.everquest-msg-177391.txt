Boats are gone mostly
And good thing too, bad idea from the start

You guys just feeling left out because now nobody has an edge in a lot
of ways. Get used to it.

Got an idea for you

Turn off luclin models
Destroy anything that you own coming from PoP
Dont go to pop at all
Dont go to luclin
Just play like that and you will never know pop is there

Oh and btw if over level 50 delevel back to that point so you have
something to kill

sheesh

This "In my day we walked to school ...in the snow..up hill ....both
ways" crap is funny
