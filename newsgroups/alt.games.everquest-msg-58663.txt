He is not subtracting the haste, he is Adding the haste, then dividing.
There is a big difference.

Delay * 0.84 is not the same as Delay/1.16.

Given that haste caps at 100%, it would not work to do the subtract and
multiply, as then all weapons would have a delay of zero.

A Haste of 100% means that you are 100% faster than without the haste, or
twice as fast.  So, you divide the weapon delay by 2 to get the new delay.

The problem is that his statement in English appears to be incorrect, his
demonstration of the calculations appears to be correct.  Assuming that Slow
works the same as Haste, then your calculation would be incorrect, I don't
know if this is the case.

The way that Haste works, is that you divide the weapon delay by (100% +
Haste Percent).  So, 16% haste means you divide the weapon delay by 116%, or
1.16.

I don't know, but I suspect that Slow works by multiplying the weapon delay
by (100% + Slow Percent).  So, 30% slow would mean multiplying the delay by
130%, or 1.30.  This is how you described slow.

If, OTOH, it works the same as haste, then you would divide the weapon delay
by 70%, or (100% - slow percent).  What is the maximum slow possible?

Did I make that clear as mud?
