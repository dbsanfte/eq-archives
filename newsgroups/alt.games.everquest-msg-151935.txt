No, bard instruments always go in the secondary hand.  You play it with your
primary hand.  At least that's how I think about it.

Now regarding the OP's question, I have no idea why you're not getting skill
ups and I haven't gotten that high a level yet with my bard (still at 10) so
my guess will probably be crap but here goes:  Since the effect of the
breathe under water song is the same with or without the instrument, maybe
that's the problem.  Have you tried using the Charisma song?  Charismatic
Carillon or whatever.  What are your stats?  Maybe that has an effect on
things.  I have no real clue.
