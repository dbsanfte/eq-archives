At your level I would concentrate more on +mana items then +int items
I'm not too sure what you could buy with that 15pp but here is a little list
of items that you should be going for:


Jaded Electrum Bracelet +10 hp +10 mana (not sure bout price but cheap)
Skull of Jhen`tra +25 mana   (15-20pp)
Silver Rose Engagement Ring  +2 Int  (5-10pp)
Robe of the Keeper +2 Int (40-60pp)
Savant's Cap +3 Wis +3 int (40pp)

Go to Qeynos do this quest for a +3 int +10 mana ring

While at Qeynos, do this quest for a +3 int ring

Good luck
