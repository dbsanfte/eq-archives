This has been hashed out for years. What you are asking for, even if
it's not "whining" is to have a comparable chance at loot up there with
people who raid all the time.

Mind you, I'm not talking about bullshit pickup raids on little stuff
like Naggy or Vox. I'm talking about high end raiding, which is where
you see DKP systems in use.

Bottom line is, they are not there raiding for any individuals. They are
raiding for the guild. Whatever makes the guild the strongest and ups
their ability to move to the next level is how the loot will be awarded.
The people that go and participate all the time are the ones who will
end up giving the guild the most bang for the buck by upgrading their
gear. Sad, but end of story.

If your real life considerations are such that you can't be in a raiding
guild and go on most, if not all, of the raids, then you're not going to
have access to that sort of gear.  Sorry to say, but that's just
something you'll have to face up to. It's not going to change.
