I had my ranger foraging in Steamfont today and noticed a zonewide message 
something to the effect of "The ground shakes as the undead rise up"  or 
something paraphrased like that... my screen shook like it was an 
earthquake... was pretty cool looking.

I was near the Ak Anon zone, so I did not see any new mobs, don't know where 
or what spawned.
