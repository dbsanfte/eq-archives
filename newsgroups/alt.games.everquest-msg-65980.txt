The models don't really use much mem, the higher qual textures do.

Im on a tnt 16 meg agp, 384 meg ram, p2 400, I have all models on and
no problem. In fact, its no more worse than with all models off. I
just have texture quality set to low. The new models are way better
than the old and this still looks good. The only rough part is the
time it takes to get to the char select screen and the several minutes
for zoning.

With texture qual set to low, and using all models, the highest usage
of my 700 meg min/max perm swap was 483 meg (shows in cacheman)
I tried setting texture qual to high and I crashed to desktop after it
used 900 meg of a min max perm swap. So the diff in memory requirement
from low to high textures in the luclin options, is freaking huge.

I also have clipping pretty darn low.. but for the most part now run
around seeing all models quite well without a performance hit. Its the
more detailed luclin city zones that give me a huge hit. Oh and I have
dynamic lighting on.
