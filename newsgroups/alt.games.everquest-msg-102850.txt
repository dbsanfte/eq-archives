heh... my Druid's KoS in Tox/Erud... leveled from 22-24 killing Emissaries
for Paineel faction

That's the tough part, yeah... my Druid is 'glowers' to those stuck-up
Rangers.... buncha snobs ;o)

Off the top of my head... I'd guess The Safehouse (Rogue site... I've never
played a rogue so don't know the site) might have some general faction tips
(getting a rogue to 'indiff' to buy/sell shouldn't be that much different to
getting a 'dark' race to non-KoS status)

Any Necro/SK specific site might be worth a look

And if all else fails... pester these sites to add something about factions.
I'd guess they must be getting pretty desperate for new content after 3
years ;o)

Sorry I wasn't more help :o)
