This has been around from the days when more NBA players were on 
the court instead of in court. Nice to see they're not rushing into fixing
it.

In any event, the problem arises when your desktop is at the same
resolution as the game. Set your desktop resolution to something else
before you log in and you won't experience the problem.

eg, in case this wan't clear to everyone, if you run the game in 800X600
and your desktop is 800X600, just switch your desktop to 640X480 before
you log in.
