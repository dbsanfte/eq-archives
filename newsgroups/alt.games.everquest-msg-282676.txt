He goes on to describe how he zoned in to the forbidden zones. This
does give him a first hand account, not a second.

You actually sound like a PR plant. A bad one. But, as I have no way to
prove nor disprove this, I am left only to speculate. Regardless, there
are ways of looking for one self at the zones without even logging in.
Not that I condone the use of such tools, but should you so choose to
do so and secretly break your EULA it is technically possible to look
inside the locally stored .eqg zone files and see what they actually
contain on the day of PoR's release.

But again, doing so would be a huge breech of your EULA, and doing so
would rightly get you banned the moment you do so. Instantly, and with
extreme prejudice. Sony knows what you do with those files, you know.
Even if you unplug from the internet and store the files on a secondary
machine devoid of anything resembling Microsoft Windows. They have
built-in RFID tags that send encoded laser beams to orbiting satelites,
giving real-time updates as to their whereabouts and status, even in
the absence of power or even a controller hooked up to the hard drive.

So don't do it.

Whatever you do DO NOT LOOK IN THE BOX! Your eyes will melt from their
sockets and the flesh will be burned from your bones the moment you
gaze upon the horror... erm... yeah.

Xiphos - I do suspect you're either a PR plant, or one of the most
naive gamers I've ever run across. And I can be pretty naive at times.
