Again yes, balance is quite important - using a stun here and there when the
enemy is about to heal themselves (or another mob) is also invaluable.
Around level 11 though a cleric will be dishing out almost as much damage as
tanks less kick so it's quite common to see them in melee.  In fact, I was
helping out with melee until I was around lvl 20....  now pushing 46 I wish
I could buy a cushion or something for my cleric :)
