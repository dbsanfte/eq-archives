Taking a map & compass with you isn't quite the same as having the GPS 
tracking system that EQ now grants you.

I have no problem with the current compass system, btw, and I hated the 
old SH skill as implemented. IF it were up to me, I'd have left SH in 
the game, but not made it improvable via practice points. Give you 1 
point per level free, and let you put it up with training points if you 
want to max it.

Let it float around like it used to at low SH. When you make a 
successful SH check, let it 'lock' on like it used to. When you are a 
master (100 skill) leave it always locked on.

For people with True north, let them cast it to get a lock on for a 
duration, ditto for people with a compass, right clicky on it to 
automatically get an SH lock for a duration.
