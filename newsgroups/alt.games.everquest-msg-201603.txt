General wisdom, for melee types, is AC first, HP second, STA third.  There 
are situational considerations as well however.  You want your Stamina to 
be over 100, that is extremely important.  You want your DEX and AGI to be 
75 minimum.  If your equipment always seems to have you encumbered, then 
you want to do something about that, whether stash some stuff in the bank, 
swap some gear for lighter gear, or get some added STR.  Look into weight 
reducing bags to carry some of your extra gear that you want to lug around.  
Another consideration, is that for some encounters you will need specific 
resists to be high, at your level, that is not much of a consideration yet, 
but, as you get into the high 40s, low 50s, and are possible doing 
Vox/Naggy, you will want to consider having some resist gear to swap in.
