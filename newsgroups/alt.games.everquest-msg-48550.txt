From the stories I've heard it sounds like many may be veterans, but they
haven't played untwinked characters for so long now they forget some
of the newbie quests.  (This is not a jab at twinks, lord knows I've done my
share of twinking alternate characters.)  I continue to be amazed at how many
barb shaman never realize they can get a free amulet that summons a magic
war hammer by simply walking to Qeynos and back.  It's not hard and gives
you a leg up on wisp hunting.
