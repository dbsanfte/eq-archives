While I'm the first to state that I have no artistic skills at all, I
*do* have an eye for clean design, which might have something to do
with it. I've put a lot of effort into presenting the information
clearly.

And mine is still a living work, whereas Xekl's hasn't been updated
since he (apparently) left the EQ community.

Well, my guide started life as a Word document into which I put the
various recipes as I found them either in-game or from newsgroup
discussions. I really started it only because *I* needed one - putting
it online was an afterthought, and I seriously never thought it would
become the success it is. Had someone told me when I was first started
pasting tidbits into that document that I'd eventually have my own
domain with 11,000 hits a month, I'd have laughed at them.

Simply put, had I found Xekl's guide earlier I wouldn't have needed to
write my own, because his had everything I needed at the time.
