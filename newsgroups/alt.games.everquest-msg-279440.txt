I wasnt complaining,just stating the facts,I have fun with *both* of
my Rangers.  =)
The problem with the Ranger class is not so much lacking dps or
missing utility,it is the Beastlord class.Why should any group want
a Ranger,when they can get a Beastlord,which brings a full set of 
Shammy buffs,more dps than any dps class,double the hps of 
a Ranger,topped by a mana regeneration buff.
Oh yeah,we have snare.  :p
