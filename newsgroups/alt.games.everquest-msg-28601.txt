	How about: I can't do the Paineel faction quest (without standing on my
head), because I can't get the items to turn in from the Kobolds?  I expect
the same to be true in Stonebrunt and Luclin, regarding both faction quests
and others.  I happen to like doing quests; I don't like being told that I'm
not allowed.

	How about: the recently-added Symbols for Erudite Clerics of Quellious?
*ALL* of the quest items for these are found in the Warrens.  The fellow who
posted the quests to the Cleric website I was referred to had a fairly new
Cleric as it happened, and he STILL had to delevel 10 times to finish the
quest.  This is an absurdity, <wallen>it's an absurdity of an
absurdity</wallen>.  And this is a brand-spanking-new series of quests.
Practically none of the existing population of Erudite Clerics can do them.
And what happens when later steps are introduced, evolving the Symbol into a
more powerful item...that Clerics of level appropriate to such an item can't
get because they can't do the entry steps of the series because *it didn't
exist when they were that level*.  These quests are prima facie evidence that
Verant's designers can NOT be trusted to get it right.

	How about: at a certain level there is no longer any such thing as a
"trivial combat"?  With a bit of bad luck a L60 character can be beaten to
death by a L35 Hill Giant.  If there's a risk involved in the fight, whether
or not it's worth EP, the PC is entitled to the reward.

	How about: the only reason this is an issue at all, to any extent, is that
Verant's designers keep screwing up.  If you put an item a L50+ character will
want on a L25 mob, then yes, L50+ characters will show up to kill that mob.
Items recently added in both Befallen and Runnyeye surpass items found in
dungeons of much higher level and risk -- why?   Didn't ANYONE over there
notice that, say, a Blackened Alloy Medallion (AC 6, INT/WIS+5) makes a
Chrysoberyl Talisman (AC 5, +3 WIS +20 Mana) look like a joke?  The former
drops from punk Goblins in Runnyeye, the latter from the Minotaur Elder in
Lower Guk.  As a 55 Ranger I can terrorize the fourth floor of Runnyeye,
slaying everything in my path with impunity.  I would think twice about trying
to hold the Minotaur Elder spawn solo.  And you wanna know what the kicker is?
THE MEDALLION ISN'T EVEN LORE.  HELLLOOOOO!!!!  <knocks on head> ANYONE HOME
MCFLY?  WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?  Could it be any more obvious that
this item is going to be farmed like Kansas?  And who are the Number One
farming classes, class?  Yes, that's right, INT-casters and Druids!  Someone
of a more Mulderian bent might speculate that such items were introduced into
Befallen and Runnyeye in order to provoke exactly such farming, and with it
the outrage of the proleteriat, in order to build public support for the
Trivial Combat rules.  Which brings us to....

	How about: ...the real reasons for the TC rules.  Part I: Verant's
designers are a subspecies of GM known as "railroaders".  Railroaders create
campaigns with tightly-controlled storylines; any attempt to deviate from the
plot is met with swift reprisal.  We see this in EQ.  Examples: Plane of Sky,
and the entirety of Velious.  (In an interview shortly after Velious' release,
its designers were PROUD of the linear-access nature of the expansion.)  The
designers get prissy when people start "abusing" their precious creations, and
respond with nerfing rewards or the spells or tactics used to defeat mobs
without X players and Y deaths.  Examples: too numerous to count, recent cases
would be the Conquest incident, nerfing of Charm in Kael, changes to healing
agro, changes to taunt value of procs...the list goes on and on.  Locking
high-level explorers out of new content is intended to force people to play
the "right" way and, not incidentally, try to prevent people from posting maps
and zone contents to web sites a week after they go live.  In other words,
it's more ego at work.  Part II: Verant wants to prolong the life of the game
as long as possible.  The fact is that they don't have another rabbit in their
hat.  Sovereign and Planetside are vaporware.  The Star Wars thing is another
team, and (to borrow a metaphor from the guys at DAoC), Koster is promising
the stars, but he promised the moon with UO and he only delivered Cleaveland.
They can't make more room at the top.  There's nowhere to go, and their last
attempt at a corpse-eating zone (Sleeper's Tomb) hasn't worked any better than
their last one (Veeshan's Peak).  So they're making room at the bottom:
content that can only be effectively accessed by new PCs, who will have to
play through it in the right order and without excessive powerlevelling
because otherwise they'll miss parts.

	It's not about farming.  They could stop the farming easily, without
pissing on explorers and questers.  It's about control-freak designers.
