This has been bitterly debated by mages for years. The only way to be sure
is to do some simple experimentations yourself. You'll need to find a mob
with little or no variance in level between test subjects. After that it's
just a matter of letting the pet kill it and then killing it yourself and
noting the amount of exp increase.
Not being the scientific type mage myself, or caring about trying to get
around every exp loophole possible, I just nuke the critter until it falls
over dead and let the exp take care of itself.
