My brother's 57 cleric was on his way to OOT to rez my 52 enc and 51 druid.
He was in WFP when he received a tell from a 51 pally who was in FV that
needed a rez...in WFP.  Well, I had people waiting on me (after the rezzes)
but I went out of my way and helped him out.

While I was looking for his corpse (I didn't know there were TWO secret
tunnels in WFP...) someone else asked me for a rez in Oasis...3 zones
away...and the person was a lousy level 27 (go kill a bat!).  I apologized
and said that I'm not headed that way.  He called me "weak" (not sure what
that means but it sounds like an insult).

Sorry, I really couldn't get through your post...non-broken paragraphs are
too hard for me to read.   But going by your subject line beggars are only
as bad as you're attitude.  What I mean is, if you can ignore them they're
not too bad.  Sometimes I can take 'em, sometimes I can't.  When people have
the attitude "give me my fucking <whatever>, you lazy-assed biotch, I have
it coming to me!" (they indicate this by either not saying please at all, or
saying *shudder* "plz.") and bitch at me when I tell them "no," well, I
admit to sometimes really going off on them (within TOS...lord knows I don't
want to be suspended because of some asshole beggar).
