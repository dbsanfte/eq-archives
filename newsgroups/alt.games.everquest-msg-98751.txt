Well, we finally got logged in successfully around 5 pm Eastern
yesterday. Given the track record, I had no faith in the servers staying
up for any amount of time, so I went with a "low risk" pair of
characters to play. Georg and I created a brand new pair of gnomes, hers
SK and mine a Pally. 

I had anticipated the differences we would see, as discussed in this
forum previously, but there were some parts of it that I had overlooked.
Previously, even though you would respawn with your newbie food, book,
and weapon at the first few levels, you *still* had to go run to grab
any loot you had accumulated off of the corpse.(Got to go sell those
rusty weapons and rat whiskers. hehehe) Now, there was no need to even
clean up the landscape of corpses. (And there were a BUNCH of them all
over the Steamfont druid ring area.) Death wasn't trivial. It was a
complete non issue. Hell, attack anything, it don't matter. So we did.

And when they said "level modifier for xp" they certainly weren't
kidding. We were grouped, so splitting the xp, and after a grand total
of maybe five rats and spiderlings, I looked at my xp bar and had over 4
yellow. Hrmm. DING!

Level four in under 90 minutes. There was no challenge of any kind, and
pretty soon I just quit and left Tiru to level up her SK a bit. (Though
I may go back and play that little pally again.)

Checking out the "enhanced" xp rates for sub-30 characters in dungeons
was easy enough, since my lvl 18 leezard was camped out in Kurns in the
safe room. Keep in mind I generally try to hunt the greater scalebones
(mid range blue) and the greater skeletons (low and light blue). The xp
bar doesn't fly, but it's pretty safe and you get a ton of bone chips. I
only pull the furbies in the basement when they spawn in one of the
entry slots where I'm hoping to find the scalebones, etc.

One greater scalebone. Almost 3/4 of a blue of xp. O... M... F... G...

On the one hand, I can see how this would *certainly* achieve the goal
of wanting to tempt more sub thirties into the dungeons. On the other
hand, I think that anybody with a decent newbie dungeon near them is
going to be able to do level thirty in about two weeks of regular play
and still be basically clueless.

As before in the other "threads that wouldn't die", this is only IMHO,
but the game just got WAY dumbed down from the look of it. I plan to log
in the lizard for a longer session this afternoon and try to see just
what sort of xp I'm getting *inside* Kurns to compare it to the same
mobs outdoors. I'll let ya know what I find. But it looks like there's
some insane xp modifiers in place now.
