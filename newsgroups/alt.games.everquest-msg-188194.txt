OK, I turned the bad word filter off and I still got kicked to the desktop.
Since it was last night, and I was in bed, I don't know yet if I made any
sales before I got booted.  Guess I'll find out tonight.  BTW, sales of
spider silk seem slow lately.  You tailors out there, get to work. ;-)

Cheers,
Eric
