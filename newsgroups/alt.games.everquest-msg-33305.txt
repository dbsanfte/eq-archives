No need to empty out.
The master looter works out the amount made in total and then uses
/split to split the money.

E.G. In Loio he can seel off the the dorf in the mill and end up with
35pp 201gp 1200sp and 0cp (Cause he binned it all) then simply does :

/split 35 201 1200 0

This is all hear say I have no evidence :
I believe that there is a maximum that you can rise above your lowest
point.
I believe that there is a lowest point.

The "can get no better" means that you can nolonger improve your
faction, but it can get worse
Like wise the "can get no worse"

I think that the "can get no worse" is a constant for all faction /
classes / races / religions.
I think that the can get no better is dependent on F/C/R/R also that if
you have ever got really low with that faction that you can only ever
get so far above your lowest point.

I'm sure that someone can confirm this or flame me <G>
