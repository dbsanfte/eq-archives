Walrus tooth from EW for a weapon and flayed skin from KC (assuming you're an
erudite or human). Dagger of Marnek from Befallen. A harvester and shadowbound
boots and gloves from the SolRo quest. Or maybe wolf fur slippers from Perma. A
few other caster goodies that are easy to come by in EW and CC. (I made a post
yesterday detailing them in a thread on newbie chanter equipment; but they'd work
for any caster class.) I *cough*TWINKED*cough* my necro with these and some nice
hp/mana jewelry (fire opal rings and black sapphire neck and ears) and never even
had to sit down to med or heal untill level 8.  /grins evilly
