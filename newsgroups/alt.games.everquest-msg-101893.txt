That's probably the best point but here's another.  I play EQ maybe 6 to 8
hours a week tops.  I don't type as fast as I think (either because I think
too fast or type too slow {80wps}.  However, when I play i normally play
with people i know in RL (Real Life for those of you who are abbreviatedly
challenged).  The most common typing mistake i make is type "teh" instead of
"the".  Usually after typing something very quickly I don't want to go back,
hold the shift button down and fix that mistake, AND my friends know it's a
common thing I do.  Now there is some difference between that and plz sow me
d00d.  But what is it?  You know what they are saying and if you don't then
they aren't going to get the SOW and you don't have to worry.  If somehow
their language skills are so attrocious that I can't comprehend what they
are saying, I will usually send a nice polite tell saying that I can't
understand the words coming from their mouth (man i love Jackie Chan
movies).  Anyhow...what is the big deal..is it their typing d00d sp34k, or
is it you having to take an extra second to figure out a new type of
language?
I sure wish i could type as fast as I think, you all (y'all??) must be
supra-geniouses...
