ahhh  ok. then i would prolly go get   the  sky belt  fr starters. they are
no-drop.  they are also  very easy to get. if your guild can field like 4-5
groups of 50s you can  get belts np.

the  dragon in  cobalt  scar is also very  easy to kill and drops no-drop
haste weapons like the sunderfury equivalent which could be  nice.
