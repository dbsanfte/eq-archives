Hehehe *exactly* the same thing happened to me, only I went one worse - As
I've never been on the FV boat before I couldn't see where the boarding
platform connecting the shuttles to the main boat was purely because of the
graphic 'glitches', hence I ended up high diving from the shuttle into TD.

Ever had that feeling something *really* bad has happened? I have now lol. I
was holding my breath when my stamina bar ran out thinking I'd end up
drowning luckily it didn't and I didn't :-) Anyway 2hrs later and lots of
help via /gu I managed to see land and found a Ranger outpost. If nothing
else Kadarm's swimming went up from 5 to 41 lol :-)

Needless to say I'll be staying put in LOIO till the graphics problem is
sorted :-)

oh btw I too have an ATI Radeon 64mb DDR ViVo, the sooner they sort this out
the better.
