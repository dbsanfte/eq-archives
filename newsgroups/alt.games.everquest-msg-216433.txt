   There are conflicting opinions actually.  I say they are, others say
they are not sure or have heard that they aren't.  But I am prepared to
back up my words.

http://home.earthlink.net/~abenlen/Augdrop.JPG

  Other than cropping the screen shot, I have done no other alterations
on it.  And if anyone wants me to link the full, uncropped screenie, I
will.

   I understand that legs I am wearing are no drop on other servers.  On
FV, even with the aug, they are still droppable, even though the
augmentation still carries the no drop label.
