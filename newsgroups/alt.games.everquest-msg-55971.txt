If you mean you are upgrading to Kunark/Velious, the answer is no.  You have
used the original key and the new keys will be used in the upgrade.  You
should be able to find a copy of CGW (?) that has a free copy of the game
w/o Kunark or Velious or the trilogy should be available for around 25
pounds.
