Some people actually liked the new character models.  They reported
virtually no video lags while using the new models.

I have the dll file here at
<http://personalpages.tds.net/~wilykat/eq/EQGraphicsDX9_Stickman_version.zip>

Simply copy it into EQ folder to replace the standard dll file and use
the no patch bypass (or simply ninja the above dll into EQ after
running patcher but before starting game)

This should work for a while until SOE makes big enough changes to its
system to break this dll.  Until then I plan to leave it available.
