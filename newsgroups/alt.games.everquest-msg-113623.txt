The Sleeper (aka Kerafyrm) is kind of a be-all end-all
dragon in Velious, not really killable. He was supposedly
the result of forbidden intercolor dragon breeding long ago.
He has four "warder" dragons that keep him trapped
(sleeping) in a zone called "Sleeper's Tomb" off of Eastern
Wastes. If all four warders are ever killed at the same
time, he wakes up and runs ramapant through a few zones,
killing everything in them, and then disappears.

This event (waking the sleeper) can only happen once per
server, and once it does, the four warders and the sleeper
never respawn, and Sleeper's Tomb becomes a more accessible,
but far less interesting zone. I think this is the only
permanent, non-reversible, server-wide event that is known
in EQ right now.
