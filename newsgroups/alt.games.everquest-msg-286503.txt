	Pfffft :-)

	They changed the AA code massively, rolled it out, and then realized
that AAs no longer worked.  

	The problem is that they DON'T test anything.  They put it on a test
server and hope one of the customers notices a problem and can explain what's
wrong in a way that they can understand and care about.  That's a broken
approach, but it fails completely when you're dealing with functionality
that's deliberately hidden from the players (such as proper AA behavior).

	I dunno, I guess I feel that if more people objected to this it
might change but it's like Windows blue screens:  people are so used to
them that they think your operating system is *supposed* to be broken...
