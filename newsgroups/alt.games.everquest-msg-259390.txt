This is, I think, what I'm noticing; I thought that it was "hey I'm 
faster" but really what it is is "hey they aren't faster than me"

Since I too am quite used to using a hop skip and jump to stay ahead of 
a mob of mobs on my tail, I hadn't really pinned it down, it wasn't till 
this long run where I noticed I wasn't jumping much at all and still 
easily maintaining a lead (not increasing one, which would be the case 
if I was faster, just not losing one either, as would be the case if I 
was a bit slower, as I'm pretty sure my previous characters were.

I had heard a rumor that mobs in newbie zones got slowed down, but not 
that -all- mobs were slowed down (or perhaps that instead, all PC's 
without Run were speeded up)

I'll try and remember to test this by slapping a green mob in the head, 
jumping away from him, then running across a zone to see if he ever 
catches back up, just for science.
