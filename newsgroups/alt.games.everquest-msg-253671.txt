Yes Warcry is badly broken .. it is meant to be a bard-like overhaste
but just ruins the other discs in use in a group.  Hope fully they will
fix this but after five months I am not holding my breath on this.

The snare has just been fixed and I have yet to have one fail on it now
.. this is most useful for groups without a native snarer.

The Berserker abilities you will use most often are the stun (head
crush etc), the snare (leg cut etc) and the distracting strike line
(like Jolt gives aggro back to tank).

The Berserker is a very unfinished class ... think chain warrior ...
hopefully they will fix it because it could show some promise.
