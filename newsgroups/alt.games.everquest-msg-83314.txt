This is why I never hunt in Oasis on any of my characters... except for when
I feel like doing SG patrol.

On a side note, if you ever do accidentally pull a spectre... or 5... just
run straight for the south ro zone, also, if you survive a round of attacks
from a spec, just run, they're naturally snared a bit (snare does still slow
them down though).   Just get out of lifetap range fast.

I like to test the mettle of newbies who beg me for buffs, I sit near the
little boat on spec isle and tell them to come to me on spec isle.  They all
think I'm trying to get them killed, until they come visit me there (if they
are worthy).
