Not at all. Most of my characters have some tailoring, I used to
always carry a small kit to combine silks to save space. My other
characters will often do quests requiring other tradeskills.

Why not start swatches now, and if you get any hides, use them as
needed.

You may want to look at the messageboards at www.eqtraders.com - I
recommend you look carefully at what you can afford that you will
skill up on. I often skill on items well over 10 skills above my own.
