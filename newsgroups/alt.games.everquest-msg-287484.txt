Because I believe theft is wrong, because I believe that the effort 
artists go to to create stuff should be protected, because when I create 
stuff I believe I should have rights over it.

Copy right is important.  Theft of copy right material is morally 
decrepit *regardless* of the law.  If I create something, it's mine, and 
I believe that unless I agree to share it, it should remain mine.

That's why several times I suggested the OP join an open source 
alternative to EQ, because people have agreed to come together and 
freely share their ideas and create something new, instead of stealing 
something from someone else.
