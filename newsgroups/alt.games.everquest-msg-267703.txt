Mobs in EQ2 (to me at least) seem to have a much smaller aggro range than
EQ1. I'd say about the same (or possibly smaller) than DAoC. I've witnessed
a train such as that on several occasions and the mobs were right by me and
passed on their way back home without attacking. On the other hand, I've
had them linger near me and then become aggro on me. Best advice is to back
away after the train a bit and let them go back to their home. If it
happened only once call it an anomaly... if it happens more than once call
it greifing (or stupidity take your pick) and get out the petition pen.
