First of all, it's not as if wizards are the ONLY class that lives or
dies by their mana. All casters do, it's just more obvious with
wizards.
You mention enchanters work in the mind control realm and have a
problem with them being in charge of mana stealing? How the hell would
YOU steal mana, burn it out a mob's ass?

If you want strange, I don't really see why druids should have
anti-summoned spells (unless it's got something to do with clearing
the woods of stuff that never belonged in this plane anyway, similar
reasoning for clerics. Basically, I could see it being magician only)

And you think we wouldn't prefer more lightning spells instead of the
incessant fire spells? When Verant did their class wish lists, that
was one of points a lot of druids wanted, IIRC. (Besides, the fire
spells kinda suck) I would want lightning instead both for the closer
link with nature and because it'd mean lower resist rates :p

Of all our spell lines, show me ONE that is better than any other
class's - except snare. Most of our spells don't even compare to what
the classes that master them can do.

You want a justification? Fine. Necromancers deal in unholy arts,
including poison, disease, unnatural forms of healing and influencing
corpses, and fear. Fear is a form of influence on the mind and necros
can do it to anything, why shouldn't they be able to paralyze
something with fear instead of just making it run away. As for lich,
lifetap, healing and giving away mana, it has to do with the unnatural
unholy arts. Go find a definition of necromancy and see what it says. 

And has anyone in this thread called the freeze spell a BAD
suggestion?

Your talk of balancing gameplay would be fine if you weren't seething
with class envy. Nevermind the suggested improvements that people
liked, you get your panties in a bunch because some of us didn't think
wizards should do an obvious enchanter thing (one they already do) and
then start whining about your wizards *healing capabilities*?? The
differences between classes are one of the things I like most about
this game and if you can't handle them, maybe you should go play one
of those games where everyone is a tank mage healer.

Oh, and where's my pet class magician's crowd control, by the way?
