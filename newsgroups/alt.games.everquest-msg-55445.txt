It depends on your level.

Your total mana is (((A/5)+2) * L) + M, where A is INT or WIS depending on
your class, L is your level, and M is the total of +MANA bonuses you have on
your gear. Roughly speaking, 1 point of INT/WIS is worth 0.2 mana per
level - e.g. at L20 1 WIS is worth 4 mana, at L50 1 WIS is worth 10 mana.
Note however there is a soft cap on INT/WIS after 200, whereby each point
over 200 is only worth a maximum of 1 mana.

Your two items even out mana-wise at about L26/27 (at L26 the AC4 gives you
just under 25 mana). If you're under L26, go for the AC5 piece, if you're
over that it depends how much you want the extra STR and AC vs. a few more
mana (even at L60 the AC4 would only be 52 mana, so it's not a big deal
anyway).
