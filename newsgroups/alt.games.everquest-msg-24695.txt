Not sure at what point camo drops, but us rangers get Sneak at level 10. You
can trade with merchants whilst sneaking to get better prices - that's what
I do when buying fletching components in kelethin. I'm human, so without
sneak I con apprehensive, with sneak it's indifferent. Saves me a couple of
plat each time, which is handy. I haven't tried doing quests with sneak, so
not sure how that works.
