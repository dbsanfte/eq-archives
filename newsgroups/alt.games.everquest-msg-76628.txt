I'm hanging around highhold right now killing some of the bandits there, one
is a dwarf and has a chunk of dwarf meat I'm able to pick up.  Are there
other areas in the game where the dwarves will drop a chunk of meat when
they die?  I've not hunted around the dwarf city yet, but may pay a visit if
the mobs there drop it as well.

Thank you.
