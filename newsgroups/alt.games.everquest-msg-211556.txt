It really is that simple.  A game is diversion, nothing more.  Real
life has consequences, sometimes permanent, that can affect you and
yours.

In game if someone ks'es you, yes they suck but it's just a game.  In
RL if someone takes your job by cheating then you have a problem.
Maybe not the best example but you get the idea.

A game has no real consequences other than your lost time, which you
can stop tossing in at any point.  Any real consequences are those you
choose to make yourself.
