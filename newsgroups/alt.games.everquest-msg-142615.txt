I wholeheartedly agree.  The rate of epics entering into the game being
artificially slowed is one of the dumbest designs in the game and does
nothing but cause conflict.  They do this using two very irritating
methods - rarity of spawn, and rarity of drop.  In my opinion all parts of
the epic should be doable if you have sufficient forces and any creature
that drops an epic piece should always have that piece (doesn't make much
roleplay sense to me that a wizard must kill Phinnie 10+ times on average to
get their staff).  I know that would make epics enter the game at an
alarming rate but one of the biggest problems is there are many groups
capable of killing an epic spawn, but the spawn only occurs once every
bazillion days or hours and then if the drop is rare they have to kill it a
multitude of times causing an even bigger bottleneck.  This type of setup is
ultimately doomed  to have conflict between players.
