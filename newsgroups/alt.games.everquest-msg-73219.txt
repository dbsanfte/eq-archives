I have read or heard in the past there is a way to change specialization if
you decide you might have picked the wrong one.  Can any provide insight to
this or direct me to a site where I might find the info?  As a mostly
soloing druid, decided I might want to try specializing in evo instead of
alteration as I have...since I don't do much healing and seem to do lots of
Dotting and nuking...thanks in advance for any help....Bill
