This was, according to a patch message, addressed sometime ago but I am
still suffering short lockups when anyone else zones in. Is anyone else
suffering this still? It happens on both my PCs :ï¿½/ Maybe that question
should read, is anyone not suffering from this and did you do anything in
particular to solve it?
