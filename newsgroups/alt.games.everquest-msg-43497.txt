Yeah I know what you mean. I had a non porting troll sk 32 that I ran
to stonebrunt from lake of ill omen to check it out. Even though she
has jboots and the boat pretty much arrived at the overthere dock when
she got there, it took like 2 hours plus. Yeah, its great and all to
have the world huge and what not but when you've got some pretty slow
boats (the qeynos to erud system being horrible..) it ends up being
TOO huge. 

Spending 2 hours of your playing time just GETTING somewhere, when
other customers are not availible to basically perform CS tasks like
porting you there, is pretty inexcuseable in a GAME. 

In real life it takes me a long time to walk 20 miles, but that is
exactly why I DRIVE it instead. I don't want to replicate that in an
online game. 

No idea what travel is like in DAOC but it seems fairly downtime free
from what I've seen.
