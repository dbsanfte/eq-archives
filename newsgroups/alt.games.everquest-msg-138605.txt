We were in Hate. Messy break in, finally find and get all corpses to safe
spot. Folks are getting ready to start clearing the zone, and we look
forward to a long steady grind with maybe some good drops. We begin pulls.

See "YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED".

Cautiously, we log in. Keep getting error message stating "Alter Plane of
Sky is Temporarily Unavailable". Then we all trickle back in. Folks were
able to log in their alts, no problem.

Then a ranger pipes up, "There's nothing on track!" And another. Even the
druids. No mobs in zone AT ALL.

/petition
wait, wait, wait

Wanderers start popping slowly, and we dined on them for a while. Even went
up to the second floor. There was nothing in that zone, and it was full when
we got there. Finally someone speaks to a guide, who can naturally do
nothing. The stuff we looted before the crash is gone. Two folks have
duplicated their Trak Idols (one on corpse, one on self).

We give up and go home, ending a very long and frustrating evening. Worse
was the CR at the very ending, but I'd rather not relive that.

So yeah, I think I can empathize.
