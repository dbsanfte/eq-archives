SolA (Solusuk Eye) (very nice loot..fine steel weapons pp gold)
Jaggedpine Forest (You could hunt Bassilisks in the caves)
Timmorous Deep (Golras on the Iceberg)
Dawnshroup Peaks (poor loot)
Merus Seru (poor loot)
Netherbian Lair (very nice PP drops off netherbians)

The simplest way is to look for guild tags on the people you have
hunted with or are commonly in the same zones as you. Strike up a
conversation and see how things go.

You can also go to the FV message boards and read the Guild postings
section. See who is recruiting. Also read the posts in the Role-Play
section and see if any personalities look appealing to you. See what
guild the person is in and seek them out in-game.
