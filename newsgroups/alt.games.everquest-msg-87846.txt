Trying again and again helped... now log in works fine... but after
selecting
my server EQ crashes to desktop... seems me is not the only one with this
issue,
according to some guild members... why do they have to screw up EVERY and
ANY
patch /sigh ...
Any bets on an emergency patch tomorrow? >:(
Oh, and that willowisp-Fred-joke ... man, this was funny... yes VI, create
more
jokes, instead of doing your work on the patches and make everything work
fine...
we gladly pay ten bucks a month for jokes like this... who wants to play EQ
if
he could read such jokes instead, hum?

Sure. Your other internet programs aren't coded by VI.
