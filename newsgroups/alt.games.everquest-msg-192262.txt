Here's what I did 4 years ago at that level as a Wizard.

Step 1) Run around and "con" things. See if it comes up blue.
Step 2) Decide if its something you want to kill.
Step 3) Attempt to kill it, if you succeed, repeat step 3 over and over
again. If you fail                 miserably, start over again at step 1.
