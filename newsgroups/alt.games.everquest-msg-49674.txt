Yup, quite a bit. WAY more fun than DAoC. No comparison. No joke.

It isn't "overwhelmingly positive", there are people on the beta boards who
were constantly harping on the things they didn't like, and that they
didn't like the game at all. I don't like the game. Most of the members of
FoH don't like the game, many other people who have played it don't like
the game.

By killing you.

If they are in the same realm, you betcha. Granted, they cannot directly PK
you, but griefing was alive and well in beta, when the devs were clamping
down on it...in release? HA!

In your opinion. In mine, the meager improvements they have made to the
interface and downtime do nothing to compensate for the fact that the game
is the "fun" equivalent of staring at a wall.

PvP is ludicriously undertested. Classes are still WAY out of whack. The
advantage given to ranged combat is...well..reflective of reality, and
reality isn't any fun when you are holding the sword and not the bow.

Higher level characters enjoy grotesque advantages over lower level ones,
and lower level ones have no level-shield to hide behind. Either they stay
in the kill-me-now-because-death-can't-be-this-boring PvE area, or they get
killed in 2 hits in the PvP.

Plus, it is not a 5 minute run back to a bind stone. Not at the frontiers.
Try an hour.

You are right, I didn't. This is an albion quest, and I never played in
that realm. Plus, it wasn't 2 hours one way, it was the same half hour trip

Those are tasks, not quests. Completely different situation. And the
existance of tasks changes NOTHING about the essential truth of my
statement.

Quests, not tasks. Tasks give xp and cash. Quests give items.

Yes, I realize they will add quests, but there is no way they can add an
infinite number of them, which is what is required for high level
characters to maintain top end gear indefinitely.

So? I remember wearing a pair of grey leather quest boots. I would get hit
there and take half as much damage as store bought yellow studded leather,
with enchantment. Quest items are *WAY* better than any other, and their
source is finite, and they wear out. Nothing changes those simple facts.

"don't let the door hit your ass on the way out" is too cliche, and I don't
believe in mincing words when it comes to morons.
