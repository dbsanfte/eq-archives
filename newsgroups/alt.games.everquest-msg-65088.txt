Hello Folks,
Sorry it took so long to get this up.

We are aware of the issues with the Bard Songs and Testing is looking at
causes and Possible Fixes at this time.

Unfortunately I don't have an ETA as to when this is going to be resolved
but I will advise you all as soon as I can.

I know you are tired of seeing this, but thank you in advance for your
patience.
