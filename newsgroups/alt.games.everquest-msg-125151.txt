I do not join pick up groups generally.  I play with folks I know for
the most part, though I have done some weekends in KC with strangers
just for exp, but that generally requires me to put  up with folks I'd
rather not so its  pretty rare.  Almost all of my equipment has been
acquired with a single group of friends with an occasional fill in as
6th man.  By your standards I am wearing crap I am sure.  On the other
hand, any time that unknown 6th person turns out to be someone that I or
another of my friends doesn't enjoy playing with we are free to ask them
to leave.  Loot whores,  knewlios and  outright pricks do not make for
good fun, so they are not tolerated.  From what I have seen on the guild
raids I have joined  most guilds seem to be led by such people hehe. 
They of course have lots of fun people, but having to tolerate the other
ones just in order to play what guilds consider to be the high end game
is something I can do only in short bursts, though I do have to admit I
enjoy being eaten by dragons and other large things <G>.  So at 57 my
wis is 215, ac barely 900 and my resists suck <shrug>, at least I can
honestly say that its always fun to play.
