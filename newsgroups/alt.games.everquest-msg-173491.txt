Memmed this little gem; EQdiva says 220 damage, 8 second stun.

Took a long time for the gem to pop up.  Targetted a mob in NL to
try it out... no mana used, nice long stun... and the gem is
greyed out again for another looooooong span of time.

I can't think of much use for this at the moment, for spell
casting interrupts I already have mez song which is far more
functional, interrupt every 4 seconds or so when I force sing
it.   I suppose I'm spoiled by my cleric, a class dripping in
stuns, but a couple stuns per minute isnt' going to tip the odds
in any fight I'm familiar with.

Is there a use for this song thats worth giving up a spell slot
for?  Even if its only occaisionally useful on a tactical basis,
at least I won't be missing something when I shuffle this to my
"back page"
