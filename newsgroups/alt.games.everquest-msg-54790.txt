My orginal theory was that the "Ghost ship" gm event was going to use the
"icebreaker" and that the new NPC's were put in to allow non-event
attendee's to get to velious and back.   Well, this was wrong as the "ghost
ship" event was in OOT and left from Freeport.    Starting the gm event at
the docks and heading into OOT at least limited the amount of peeps that
could flood the zone.  My event crashing party arrived in OOT too late to
take the ghost ship and road the regular boat to bb.  We did hear the shouts
of the event going on but we couldnt narrow down the location and decided
not to start swimming, oh well.

I have always thought that insta-ports at the docks for levels 20 and above
would be a great idea.  Curious to see if this is what they intend.  Since
the iceclad to nro route has no worthwhile stops like OOT or TD, this would
be a natural good one the have the ports remain.
