    That's one of my favorite sayings. It loses wars for my opponents [in
games] and keeps my competition in the stone age! There's a few other saying
that might apply; don't compare apples to oranges, don't try and squeeze a
round peg into a square hole. Look I've got two more saying than you, I'm
winning.

    Are you arguing both for and against it? Maybe it's not obvious. Maybe
they'd do it, and it would only offend 2% while making it a better game for
the other 98%. But.... if that's the case... why'd you bring it up?

    Well I don't imagine they'd be keeping it alive if it were losing money.

    No, you were asserting that capitalism is about choice. Now, you may not
realise it, but to many people that is a statement screaming out for
rebuttal.
