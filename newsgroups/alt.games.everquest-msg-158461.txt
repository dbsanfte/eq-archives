Well.. Druids can whine all they want.. but that does not mean that their
whole purpose is porting?
I think you should consider what other uses druids get's besides being the
taxi..

1. I dont mind having a druid with me when going to a ugly dungeon? Good to
be ported OUT without having to fight the way when the raid is over.. right?
2. Evac? Yes.. many get evac, but it is still useful
3. Buffs.. Aye.. i don't mind some good druid buffs at all :)
4. Healing .. Very good to have a druid on any raid if cleric needs backup
healing of eg. casters or whatnot..

There is of course many other uses.. but i see them as still important..

So.. to you Druids out there "KEEP GOING"..
