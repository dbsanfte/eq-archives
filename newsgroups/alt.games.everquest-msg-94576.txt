Methylated Spirits, basically ethanol (with some colouring) normally used as
a brush cleaner or cheap alcohol for old school tramps, new ones are
referred to as the homeless and normally use heroine, by all accounts.

One of the saddest thing I have ever seen was an old tramp in Oxford Street
(Sydney, not London) with a 1/2 ltre bottle of Meths, shaking it to get the
flavour of the chopped pieces of fruit that had been added to it, lovely.
