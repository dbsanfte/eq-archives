I agree it won't be much use in LDoN - but that doesn't worry me much.
Those mobs don't hit real hard, and my pets can't be pushed past 
enrage by a single hit unbuffed.

I <3 suspended minion 2 :)

I'm really looking forward to:
Group DS's hitting my pet (low duration so they will be cast regularly)
Spiritual Vigor (from my BL)
The group IoS on Test.
Our druid keeps BoR up on us - the extra 25hp per tick will be nice if
Elemental Siphon goes live.

I'm sure I can convince our regular cleric and druid to use mark and bot9
when I get there instead of singles, because it will be hitting 4 people.
And they always treat my pets as people - partly because I do.

Well - unless you can convince the RL to hold buffs until you reach the
zone and have suspended minion 2, then they won't get buffs.  However,
In a lot of PoP encounters we deal with the AE's by having Clerics, Druids,
and BL's MGB HoT's, SoTW and Paragon.  This is why melee survive in the
ae better than pets - they get these heals.  With this AA so will my pets. 
 

I agree that it is definitely situational.  However, the way it was 
originally coded (putting the burden on the buffer) practically guaranteed
that pets would never get buffs this way.  This way you can decide for 
yourself whether it's important for your pet to get group spells.  In your
case that may be no, in mine it's a resounding yes.  I like that it's
in our hands.  Also, we won't lose any other AA's as a result - mages
and BL's at least already had Pet Affinity on their aa list  - so their
group spells could hit all pets (under the old mechanic).  Like a mage
would spend 20aa so pets in his group could be hit by a DS :/

As far as why should it cost AA when it should be built in - I agree.  But
I always though /pet hold should be innate too.
