What racial epithet? Nigger? I don't see it. Blacks use it with each
other all the time, sometimes as a term of endearment, sometimes as a
put down. It depends on the context. If they're able to use the word
without it being an epithet, certainly all of us can. Surely, you're
not suggesting only people of the right color can use the word? That
would be racist, wouldn't it?

I'm simply using logic rather than raw emotion my friend. I'm sorry it
distresses you so.
