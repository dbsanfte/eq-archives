ROFL, not hardly.  60 SK gains little/no sustainable DPS vs. undead.
56 Paladin gains a little DPS vs. Undead, maybe even enough to edge
a smidge past an equal geared 56 Warrior (I could've switched to a
slightly more damaging weapon as well as switching buf procs and
casting a weak nuke once a minute or so), but part of that gain is
offset by losing all DPS from buff procs vs. the live mobs in the
mix, and nuking isn't pure DPS gain as you're not swinging while
waiting out the long-assed cast time on the nuke.  At any rate,
both the Knights are still doing Warrior-esque DPS, and Clerics
can't get all that close to matching Wizard DPS even vs. undead.

You could close the gap a bit further if everybody was 65 with lots
of AAs and highend gear:  Cleave allows an SU3 Paladin to actually
do more sustained melee DPS than a Warrior vs. undead (add in buff
proc and you can almost pretend you're dangerous), and SKs can out-
damage Warriors vs. mobs with unexceptional poison resist, but it
still would not be a high DPS group (although the eye-candy factor
would go way up).
