    EQ requires very little thought to play. It does require thought to play
well. Anyone with time can keep grinding away slowly, though.

    It's hard if you want to be 'leet. I see where my guild is, I see the
players in my guild. They aren't a bunch of cat-ass smelling,
so-pale-they-glow geeks (although I'm sure a few are). They don't spend
every waking moment online. And yet they have achieved goals that few others
on my server have achieved, despite how badly those others want to do these
things. I also see the amount of planning that goes into raid strategies and
organization. If these things don't require a ton of time, then why haven't
more people done them?

    Nice answer - for a martial arts master. Not a good answer for a regular
person, though. Landmarks in EQ, especially in some of the more massive
zones that exist, are few and far between. Swamp of No Hope is a good
example - the tree placement is non-unique, there's few "camps" in the zone
that one could orient from, the rare ruined statues in the zone are mostly
clumped in the north half of the zone, towards Cabilis. Trying to direct
someone to that little bag underwater would be damned-near impossible
without /loc.

    Likewise for the "open plains"-type zones. Trying to find a corpse in a
place like South Karana would be nutty - "I was turned SSW at the northern
spire near Paw, then I went forward for five minutes with a level 28 SoW
before being attacked... oh Hell, buy me a Chipped Bone Rod and meet me at
the bridge."

    I navigate by landmarks in real life, too, as opposed to by abstraction
(street names, etc.) There are places in EQ, places you want to go, which
just aren't accessable with landmark navigation.

    This isn't Darwin. You won't get rid of those you clearly consider your
intellectual inferiors, you'll just piss off everyone.

    Nice leap of faith. Many of "those folks" would stick to the zones that
DO have clear landmarks, and play anyways. Places like Oasis, Lake of Ill
Omens, Overthere (along the walls), Dreadlands... hey, I think I see a
pattern here! It's almost as though, as if, dare I say it, the people you
most want out of the game use landmarks and not /loc!

    You'll never see the best games from a gamer's point of view because if
they ever got popular (like good games do) the gamers would whinge and cry
about all the people bastardizing "their" game.
