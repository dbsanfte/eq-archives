I've been noticing mob's "disappearing". They are there one second,
disappear and show up a distance away. When fighting and they turn to
run away, they'll disappear for just a split second right in front of
me, only to show up again a short ways away, but still out of range of
my melee weapons. I thought it was just my system, maybe due to lag or
something, now I'm not sure after playing last night. Another player
said the same thing was happening on her system.

I should have a system worthy of running EQ just fine, so I don't
think it's the system itself. Anyone else seeing this? Any reports
from Verant on this? Any possible things to try and right this anoying
problem? I do run my firewall in the background and Cacheman, which
keeps the harddrive in order and recovers memory. Video is all on
high. Thoughts, please.
