2 months into release, and still no relics? I suppose that makes sense,
since the untested-until-release thief classes would just steal them
immediately (yes, I know they are supposed to weigh a ton, BFD) when they
went in.

No penalties....YET, and that is assuming you buy into the idea that being
killed and losing the time you wasted running around are not penalties.
Losing a relic will be a penalty, since they provide benefits to EVERYONE
IN YOUR REALM. So much for people not having PvP affect them if they don't
want it; Xp stone gets stolen, and suddenly every single player in that
realm is getting less xp with every kill.
