Not really, Only thing I would think about is keeping the fastest haste
on the main tank so that he can keep the aggro, slower haste is fine
for the other melee people.

Not really necessary for most hunting grounds. I would hope most
characters have some decent light sources, and if they have at
least infravision that is plenty.

Not really necessary on the hybrids unless there are only
hybrids in the party with you.

This is a must, anything that reduces downtime is a must.

This all depends on your mana, you should not be casting it on
everyone, only the main melee classes and pets last, mana permitting.

>      Sympathetic Aura (cha buff on necros, bards and myself)

Well this all depends on how much charming these people are doing.
You as the enchanter definitely, but the others the benefit is moot if
you are there and have mana.
