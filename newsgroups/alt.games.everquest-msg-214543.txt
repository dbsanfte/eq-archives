I make weapons for a living, and take martial arts classes with some black
belts.  I've been hit by a sword while wearing plate, chain, leather, and...
well not wearing nothing.  Trust me on this, wear the plate.  Turns being hit
with a sword into being hit with a whiffleball bat.  Now the training you are
talking about applies just as well to plate wearers as it does to martial
artists in their Gi tops; taking a hit and rolling with it is definately part
and parcel of the operation.  After all, I'm standing here laughing about being
hit with a whiffleball bat; ask your average man on the street how he'd feel
about that and you might not get such a lighthearted response.

To me, dodge, block, parry, and to a lesser extent Riposte cover much of the
martial artist response, and as for "physical conditioning", both they and more
classic fighters need all of this they can get, and it equates more or less to
hit points.  Martial artists tend to be less heavy musclebound opponents than
warriors and football players, because so much of what they do is based on
getting out of the way or deflecting the force of the blow and on using
techniques to disarm and control their opponents, while sword and shield
fighters (and football players) concentrate more on absorbing the blows and
continuing to fight.  A martial artist who's had 2 feet of steel driven thru
his unarmored body isn't really all about continuing the fight.

Oh, wearing chain armor makes the sword feel like you've been hit with a two by
four, and leather makes it feel like you've been hit with a sheet of plywood
edge on, assuming it doesn't get punched or sliced right thru.  In cotton, it
feels like you've been hit with a sword, I imagine. Personally, I'm not
planning on trying leather again, much less going for the Gi top.
