You should have kept reading, it seems the site made it very clear up front
exactly where the donated money would go.  Had you scrolled down a little
further, you would have found this statement.

After much thought, we've decided to put up a PayPal button (it should be
over there to the left, under the other nav buttons ...), so that folks who
wish to help contribute to site expenses can do so. The majority of this
money will go to the lovely folks at Refplace, who have been eating the
expense of hosting this lovely community site for the past year. A smaller
portion will go to the DenMother to cover expenses of software, time, and
hair color to hide the extra grey hairs earned while playing mom to the
site. ;) It should be set to accept credit cards as well as transfers from
other PayPal accounts. Please whimper on the boards if you have problems
with it.
