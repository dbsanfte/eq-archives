When the appointed group leader (not the "leader" in the
sense of who did the invites, but the "leader" who has
been designated as the one who makes the decisions of
what to do when, how, and by whom) calls for "RUN", then
by gosh, *run*.

There's no point in everyone standing around getting
beat on, going, "no, after *you*..."

That said, however, my Paladin is almost always the
last one through the zone line.  Not only is it
very RP for the Paladin to stand and hold off the
nasties in order to give everyone else a chance to
make it to safety, but Paladins are well equipped
to a) survive such a "last stand" longer than most folks,
and b) actually do something useful to help other people
in the group make it out alive (e.g. root/stun/tank/heal/
Lay Hands/etc.).
