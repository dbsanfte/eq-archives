I was going to ask the same question as Wizard did in starting this

don't know the technical term, but "latency" seems like it would
apply. If the pixels can't switch very rapidly, a game might appear
smeared or blurred.

I've got my heart set on a 19" Iiyama Vision Master Pro 454 CRT. True
Flat, incredible resolution and refresh rates. Just waiting for some
