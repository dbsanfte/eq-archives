No, it is not "close enough" to instantly. You can't keep real-time
updated track of EXACTLY where you are on a map in your head unless
you have some implants the world doesn't know about yet. There is no
"borderline" here. It's a cheat. Period. Just as much as typing the
show map cheat in Doom.

SneakyAmp in no way modifies the game. It doesn't interact with the
game in any way. It doesn't provide access to information not
available normally.

SneakyAmp is nothing more than a keystroke monitor tied into WinAmp
controls. Test: Fire up WinAmp with SneakyAmp. Fire up notepad. Type
whatever phrase you use to start it up. WinAmp starts. Now, close
notepad. Click on the desktop. Type the phrase again. It still works.
In EQ, type the command to go to the next song. Winamp goes to the
next. Shift+up arrow to send the same line again. Nothing.

The tests are whether the program has any effect on gameplay (While
Winamp/sneakyamp may make your time more enjoyable, the game is
totally uneffected) and whether it interacts DIRECTLY with the game or
the data it sends and receives.
