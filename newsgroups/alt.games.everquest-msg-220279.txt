Sorry Lance, but I've got to disagree with both of your assessments.

If your rogue knows what he is doing, the chances of him setting off a
magical (Int Caster) or cursed (Wis Caster) trap are very close to zero.
I've only had it happen once since I learned what I was doing, and I
strongly suspect that was due to another group member messing with the chest
while I was examining it.

The patch message claimed the loot in them was upgraded, and that matches my
experiences with opening them since the patch.   Out of the 10 chests I've
opened, I've gotten 2 augments, 1 blue diamond, 2 diamonds, 1 black
sapphire, and 3 no drop illusion potions.   No chests have been empty and
only one had nothing but a 10pp VT item.

As for the floor traps, in a level 55 average dungeon, the floor traps, such
as the poison DoT, can do over 1300 hp in damage.  Thats more than my naked
and unbuffed total life at this level.  (Trust me, I proved this).   Even
buffed, thats a significant amount of my total life in damage.   Half the
time the group ends up pulling to a trap room so my disarming is preventing
quite a bit of damage during our stay there.   The traps that hit the puller
are out of my range, but unless we have a dedicated (and good) puller, I
usually have plenty of time to sneak / hide along with him, and disarm the
traps so even he doesn't get hit.

Sense and disarm traps may not be critical, but they're a hell of a lot
better than they were before.   And they finally allow a rogue to bring a
bit more to a party.

And?   You're not a rogue.   Give me tracking, and you can have the same
sense / disarm caps as I get... deal?
