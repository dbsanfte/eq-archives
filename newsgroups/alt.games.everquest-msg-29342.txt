I'm sure you'll get answers to questions you're asking, so I'll just toss
this pointer out...

NK is a REALLY BAD place to stare at your book.  Port to any other place you
can port to and mem them there.  There's a few thing that are very red to
you at 19 in NK.  USUALLY they're not by the druid ring, but I've been
killed before, and chased away more than once (of course, at level 51 I
chase THEM, but... <g> ).
