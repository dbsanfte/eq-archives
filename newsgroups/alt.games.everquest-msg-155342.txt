I know that some of the illusions have side benefits, troll=regen,
darkelf=ultravision but are there any others?
The reason I ask is I play a High Elf Enc and have casted illusion Gnome on
myself and I seem to run much faster. I know that the perspective changes as
far as height goes but still...
Any other benefits of other illusions I am not aware of?
Dave-
