The second table is the interesting one - note that the following had no 
avoidance, no shielding and had AC within 70 points of one another.

(shld/avd removed as they are zero here)
(DB was 102 for each, so removed it to fit) 
(also note, best in fixed width)

CLS - Class
AC - AC with virtue
SHLD - Amount of shielding on items
AVD - Amount of avoidance on items
DB - Damage Bonus of the mob. This is modified by shielding.
DI - Damage interval of the mob. This is modified by warrior innate 5% 
reduction of the DI.
MIT% - 0% mitigation would be max hits every single time. 100% 
mitigation would be min hits every single time.
ATKS - Total number of punch attacks
HIT% - Hits that landed divided by total punch attacks
MISS% - Misses divided by hits that landed plus misses not including 
blocks, parries, dodges, or ripostes
BLK% - Blocks divided by total punch attacks
DDG% - Dodges divided by total punch attacks
PRY% - Parries divided by total punch attacks
RIP% - Ripostes divided by total punch attacks
DMG - Avg damage taken per punch attack, basically AVG * HIT%. 

CLS AC   DI    AVG MIT% ATKS HIT%  MISS% BLK% DDG% PRY% RIP% DMG
WAR 1380 21    273 64.5 1854 48.1  43.1  NA   4.9  5.9  5.5  131.4
MNK 1331 22.1  317 54.0 2550 46.8  42.1  10.4 4.5  NA   4.4  148.4
RNG 1308 22.1  316 54.2 2026 51.6  40.6  NA   3.6  5.6  4.0  163.3

Note that the Average hit on the monk was nearly the same as that
on the ranger, with only a 22 point difference in AC.

Also note that miss% + blk% + ddg% + pry% + rip% + hit% is greater
than 100.  2 guesses: 1) more than one can happen on a swing or
2) Since percentages are found with parrys/punches, if a bash/kick
got parried/blocked etc then that would skew the numbers.

Look at the monks hit% vs. the other classes.  He took the same average
hit as the ranger, he just got hit less.  Based on this (truly 
insufficient data) I'd hypothesize (as in just a guess) that mitigation
goes in tiers:

Tier 1: Warriors (with their inherent bonus)
Tier 2: SK, PAL
Tier 3: Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Berserker, Cleric, Bard, Shaman
Tier 4: BL, Druid
Tier 5: Robes

Those are very loose - note that the cleric got hit a bit harder
than an SK with 97 less ac and a bit of avd as opposed to the 2%
shld the cleric had.  But he may actually belong in Tier 2.

That's why average hit is in there, as is hit percentage.  You can
clearly see why the monk took less DPS than the ranger.

What are the caps on ranger Defense/Parry/Riposte/Block? 

(quick look up)

Here's why I don't like Caster's realm, they still list Ranger Defense
capped at 200.  I know it got upped, I seem to recall to 240.  I know
my BL caps at 240.  If the rest of the caps are right (no guarantee)
then it's 220 parry, 170 dodge, 150 riposte.

At a guess, berserkers should get hit a little less often.
