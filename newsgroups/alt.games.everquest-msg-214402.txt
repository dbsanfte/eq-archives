Twink monks, or the average monk?

Yes, I knew that. Try those tricks in, say, PoN.

Anyone can tag a pull if they know what they are doing. In fact, IME the 
best tagger is the MA, as that gives him ready-to-go aggro before the mob 
even makes it to the camp.

Oh please. SKs were better tanks than Monks- as an ex monk tank I can say 
that aggro management was the worst problem with a monk tank, before they 
changed our damage mitigation to orc pawn-like levels. Now monks are 
entirely untenable as tanks. Given a choice, I would always choose an SK or 
Pally over a Monk.

Both, I think. A lot of "monk" armor is all/all or many/many, which means 
that there is a larger market for the items.
