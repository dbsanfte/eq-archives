No, the guide character is put on a seperate server from the ones
you usually play on and you are in fact told not to play any regular
characters on that one either. The character does not level and
gets all the lil GM tricks like invuln, monster killing, etc. 
They also get to insta port to zones, wear the pretty guide armor,
etc.

Mostly they bear the brunt of initial Customer Service and having
to turn players down, or escalate things to a GM who usually "won't
be on until Tuesday."
I feel sorry for them really.
