My guild isn't time geared or close to it.  We enjoy playing together tho and
LDON has some very *fine* gear if you are willing to put in the time, and
luckily a bunch of us like LDON.  (Too many, in fact.  I wish you could do a 8
person group...).
Suggestion for smaller guilds that need gear:  We've taken to doing hard
Mistmoore missions... usually one a night.  We each get 100 points per mission.
 It adds up fast.
