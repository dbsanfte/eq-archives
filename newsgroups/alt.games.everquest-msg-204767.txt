Wolves in DSP can drop Wolf Fang Earrings....Greed and Roleplay don't mix
:ï¿½)
Saying this it doesn't occur to most people to not attack the Wolves and
Bears when they are Druids or Rangers.
There is a faction of QRG (Qeynos Rangers Guild?) Protected Animals which
I'm wondering if this is the faction that Wolves and Bears exist under...If
you were to quest enough (there are 2 quests that can raise it) with a good
aligned character would this ever get you to the Druid or even Ranger level
of Animal Love <ahem> or...does this only have effect on the animals that
are in Surefall?

The faction itself cannot be raised in killing anything and can be only
lowered by killing Druid type NPC's unkempt, Treeants and Druids that hang
about the portal rings
