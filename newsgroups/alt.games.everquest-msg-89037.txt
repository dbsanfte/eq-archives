It would be almost painful if it weren't so humorous.

Sunday we have a raid set up for the Hole. Nothing special, and it's not
our normal raid time (stupid real life! grrrrr.) so I'm not expecting a
huge force. Boy, was I right. Eighteen people, and mostly all *low* to
mid fifties. MA available for this raid just made 55.

Well, no biggie. Yael wasn't up anyway. (Apparently that new boss mob
"random spawn delay" thingie, since Xev crashed Saturday night.) So we
form up to go in. Figure we'll at least hit the undead tower and try to
grab the shaman and/or chanter epic mobs. Well.... what do you know? TWO
other guilds (about our level/size) are in there raiding. It's a big
zone, but we're still going to be butting heads.

/sigh

We decide to say screw it and just go in , find a nice spot in the city
or something, maybe hit the Jail, and camp it for a while. We go down
and pick our way past an entry group, a courtyard group, and the first
raid force who are stalled near the bank. We go over by one of the
fountain areas and start pulling. I'm in group two. (SA group). I
stupidly didn't put a damage shield person in the MA's group, so he's
/gu asking for DS as needed. He does his usual /gu "Fresh DS please".
Druid_01 who is in my group (a very dear friend and wonderful, fun girl
to play with) chimes in, /gu "No problem. Incoming."
NOTE: Druid_01 works third shift and had come to the raid several hours
after getting off work and had been up about twenty hours.)

Druid_01 begins to cast a spell.

LOADING. PLEASE WAIT

WTF????????

You have entered Butcherblock Mountains.

/em sighs, clearly disappointed.  But not NEARLY as disappointed as the
twelve remaining people who have three rock golems and several
elementals of various sorts on their asses, while two of the clerics and
the ONLY enchanter are now on the other side of the planet with me and
the druid.

They manage to finish off the mobs with only one death... rez, and they
port everyone out to Toxx while we port back there. We tell everyone to
run back to the pool in Paineel and we'll go in again. I get a tell
from, this time, Cleric_03.

Cleric_03 tells you, 'Had a bad lag spike zoning into Paineel.'
You tell Cleric_03, 'Yeah. Lag's pretty bad today for some reason.'
Cleric_03 tells you, 'No. I mean REAl bad JUST as I was running in.'
You tell Cleric_03, '???'
Cleric_03 tells you, 'You can guess where I am.'
You tell Cleric_03, 'You're kidding, right?'

He wasn't. He ran off the cliff and did the 10K header and faceplant
into the Hole.

/em sighs, clearly disappointed again.

I log off the troll, log on my CR mule, and start the looooong
sneak/hide down to Master Yael's cave to drag him back. Everyone waits
around for us. Get done with CR, log on Troll, and even though most of
the day is shot, we rush back in to at least kill some more mobs in the
city in revenge. We make it to the bank. The usual flood of mobs comes
out and we're fighting them.

LOADING. PLEASE WAIT

You have entered Butcherblock Mountains.

/em glares at Druid_01

/em rolls on the floor laughing at the vindicitve gods of Norrath.

All I could do at that point was laugh for about five minutes, log, and
go play my new leezard on Innoruuk.

This raid was NOT meant to be.

/sigh
