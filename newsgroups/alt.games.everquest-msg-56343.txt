The answer is a firm "HELL NO". Back when I was playing a bard, from 
level 1 to 46, I have not seen more than 5 people that understood what a 
bard can do other than play mana song and resist songs during raids.
Oh, plus there are a few people that percieve bards as those uber kiters 
that should be nerfed

Actually, fear whenever you can do so safely. It makes a difference when 
nobody has to take damage.

yeah

If I remember right, it used to be a problem back when Selo's didn't 
overwrite SoW
