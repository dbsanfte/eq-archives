last night I ran across Watch Sergeant Grolj and a few An Undead Watchmen
in OT. They were right in front of the outpost entrance near the book.
Grolj conned red to my 38beastlord, the watchmen were blue. They seemed
to be on outpost faction. I've never seen them before. Anyone know what
the story is on these guys?
