I've tried this a few times, and always end up giving it up and
driving up the skill by explicitly mashing the key.

The trouble with tying left-arrow to a hotkey is that I have
several hotkey banks, often with several keys already dedicated
to other things (e.g., my monk has Feign Death and Mend on the
same pair of hotkeys on every set), so dedicating yet another
key to be "/doability X" gets in the way.  But if I don't put
it on every hotkey set, then sooner or later I'm sure to switch
to another set of hotkeys and the next time I turn left I end
up doing something completely unexpected.

What I've generally done instead is set up a hotkey that does
lots of training, either of one skill or several.  E.g., until
my druid maxed Tracking, I had a key that did tracking 5 times
(with suitable pauses).  My monk has one that does fishing,
feign death, stand, intimidate, autoinventory.  (And for when
I'm not fishing, I have feign + stand + intimidate, which I can
do while running as long as I hold the up-arrow key or hit
autorun after the /stand.)
