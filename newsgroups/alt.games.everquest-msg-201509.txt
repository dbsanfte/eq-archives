Further Down the Line Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest 
team have plans for the future of the game. Further Down the Line is where 
we will keep you informed about what those plans are. Please understand 
that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of 
research or development time. 

1) Partial Zone Revamps 

These consist of improvements in the experience gain, monster density 
and/or item rewards in some of the older zones. The goal is to improve the 
playability and reward for adventuring in these zones without completely 
remaking the contents of the zone. We plan to do several of these, and 
we'll keep you updated as we move through these. We recently finished 
Veeshan's Peak, the Temple of Droga and the mines of Nurga. Currently we 
are working on a partial revamps of The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), 
Dragon Necropolis, Sirens Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, Cazic-Thule, 
and Velketor's Labyrinth. 

2) Updated Character Creation Descriptions 

EverQuest has evolved and improved a lot over the last four plus years. 
With four years of updates and enhancements, sometimes your information 
gets outdated. One of the things we will be doing soon is updating the 
character creation information both in game and on the web site. 

3) Damage Over Time Spell Foci 

We are working on implementing focus items for Damage over Time (DoT) 
spells. Focus items improve aspects of certain spells when they are cast. 
Originally, DoT spells were included in a group of other spells that some 
focus items affected. But the nature of DoT spells is very different than 
other spells, and the affect of these focus items on DoT spells was not 
what we wanted it to be. A new class of focus items needs to be created to 
increase the effect of DoT spells. 

4) Items in the Planes of Power 

We will be looking at the quality of Planes of Power item rewards and 
improving them where appropriate. Items for many of the lower tier gods 
will be upgraded and more rare items and NPCs will be added to the 
following zones as needed: 

Crypt of Decay 
Plane of Torment 
Halls of Honor 
Plane of Tactics 
Plane of Innovation 
Bastion of Thunder 

5) Class Balance 

We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of 
melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at 
the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this 
situation will take some time. Some options being considered are:

Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines 
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons 

Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their 
spells, and changing them where appropriate. The goal here is to remove 
annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power 
overall. 

6) Shields and blocking 

We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to 
block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it 
should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to 
increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players 
who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan 
on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and 
therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. 

7) Tradeskills 

We will be looking at the chance of failure for tradeskill recipes. We are 
aware of the concerns of trades folk in EverQuest, and it is on our 
schedule to review things such as the fact that masters of trade skills can 
fail the easiest recipes. That doesn't necessarily mean that we plan to 
change it, but we will most certainly look it over - and probably will 
change it :) .
