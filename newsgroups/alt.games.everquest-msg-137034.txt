I know that when I had my ati xpert 2000 (shitty card, rage 128) the gamma
correction in the game didn't do anything, and there wasn't a control in the
advanced display settings for windows to do that either.  Got rid of that
card quick, it'd overheat in everquest and lockup, then windows would have
to reboot because the driver would crash after it lost contact with the
video card.

Never had a problem with my nvidia geforce256 (around $40 bucks new!), and
its not even an up to date card, 32 meg ddr and fairly outdated compared to
the newer cards but plays everquest effortlessly.
