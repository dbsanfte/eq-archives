I'm not particularly worried about whether or not it will be useful in 
GoD as such. Regular SoW speed, or Billy, would be fine with me for the 
PoP and before zones that I'll likely still hunt for my xp. However, if 
the skill is either broken or, as another poster said, such a slight 
increase that you can see no difference over Run 3, I'm certainly not 
flushing fifteen points into it.
