    This is what every cleric in this thread is disputing. We've all seen
bad things happen - a string of resists on slow, adds that the puller didn't
shake, a healer or the snarer lags. Shit happens. The group with the healer
at 80m is in a lot better position to survive "shit happens" than the group
with the healer at 30m. And yes, even at "normal" difficulty I've seen
situations which were very dangerous to people such as you and I. The worst?
Wizard (also the snarer and evac) lags during a fight with a SHM mob,
finally goes LD as the mob turns and runs at breakneck speed through two
rooms with 5 mobs each in them. Had I been at 30m, we would have died.

    Hardly. You're claiming that your cleric stays at mana level X over
time. He may dip below that on hard pulls, but in general that's where he
stays. If your cleric and Bergh's cleric have the same mana regen, and both
clerics are holding at some mana level (no matter how different those levels
may be), guess what? You and Bergh are pulling at the same rate. The
difference is this: if Bergh's group has a bit of a slow patch, his cleric
can start nuking or redoing short-term buffs to use the extra mana. If your
cleric goes OOM during a hectic patch, your group is placed in trouble.
