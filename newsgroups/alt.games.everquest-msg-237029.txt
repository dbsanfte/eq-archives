    I not positive about the details, but I got the impression that didn't
mention her little price requirement until the party wiped, then it was fork
over the money or no rez for joo.  But... I wonder how they got the money to
give her, now that I think on it.  Did she meet them all at the wayfarer camp or
the PoK first?

   But your post does give me an idea.  Join a group, let it wipe, then charge
for the rezzes... I'll be rich in no time!  Woo-hoo!

Wait... that's a _bad_ idea.
