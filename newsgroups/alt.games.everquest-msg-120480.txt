A short list of initial findings from Graffe's:

Sarnak Arcane Fetish - Improved Healing II
Batskull Earring - Reagent Conservation I
Polished Bone Bracelet - Affliction Efficiency I
Bracelet of Woven Grass - Spell Haste I
Golden Efreeti Boots - Enchancement Haste II
Damask Robe - Extended Enhancement I
Green Silken Drape - Affliction Haste II
Moonstone Ring - Extended Range II
Runed Mithril Bracers - Reagent Conservation III
Azure Sleeves - Improved Damage I
Ring of Goblin Lords - Affliction Haste I
Turtle Shell Helm - Improved Healing I
Chipped Bone Bracelet - Affliction Efficiency II
Savant's Cap - Reagent Conservation II

Later they added the Phenocryst Focus (sp?) as having the Improved
Damage III.

I was pleased to see that, even though I can only make use of items up
to level II, I already have the enhancements for haste, reagent
conservation, and range without buying a damn thing. ;-)

Wizards all over are dancing a happy jig. Of course, the emergency patch
they had immediately upon coming up was claimed to be due to the focus
effects screwing up. Probably somebody cast five nukes in a row for 100x
normal damage or something and ran off to solo ToVN. he he.
