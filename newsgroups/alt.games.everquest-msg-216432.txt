Sad to say, but not many Paladins seem to have much of a clue how to
help out an Enchanter, nevermind that they get more fast-casting
single-target zero-damage stuns than any other class.  Of course,
when I'm MT it's usually a bad idea to be changing targets, but my
fast casting group heals generate lots of agro as well.  As for
Clerics, most seem never to load stun, but you'd think they'd be
bright enough to toss a heal on the Enchanter or a Root on the mob
the instant they saw things weren't going as planned.  It's also
possible that the folks you grouped with hadn't yet realized that MMC
is a bit tougher on Enchanters than the DL.
