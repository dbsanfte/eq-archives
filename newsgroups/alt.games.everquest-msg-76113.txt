Did you happen to kill any fire beetles in making level 2?   Did you loot
them?  Did they have eyes?  Did the eyes end up in your primary and secondary
weapon slots, so it thinks you are trying to use a light source as a weapon?

The solution is to open your inventory and check your hands.   Take the fire
beetle eyes out and put them in inventory instead.
