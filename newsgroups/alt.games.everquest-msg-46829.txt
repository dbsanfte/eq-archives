I am running XP and everquest won't get past the server page....keeps
disconnecting me.  i think it is due to my SB Live sound card.  Had the same
issue with win98_se until i downloaded the latest liveware for my soundcard
and all was better, unfortunatly there is no liveware for XP and win 2000
liveware doesn't work  :(   maybe gonna have to reinstall win 98 or go to my
buddies house to get my EQ fix for the day

Anyone else have or get around this prob?

Thanks, Miladr   -Brell-
