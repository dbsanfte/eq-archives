That and more; I can sing 4 pulses of mana song during cantata
while keeping cantata up; this means moving it to a normal song
duration cuts a full pulse of mana out of the loop.  If that was
all, then what Diablo is saying would be some compensation, I'd
be able to sing a couple something elses plus cantata plus
clarity.  Assuming that it doesnt' conflict with Cantata, if it
does then its a much larger nerf, instead of about 1/7th, its now
what, 1/2?

But in addition to this, if you have more than one bard in the
group, you'll lose the entire mana output of that second bard;
used to be he could go full on clarity plus an amp every 3
cycles, and stack just fine with whatever the first bard was
doing.  Now he's dead meat, unless of course they are stackable
so one bard turns on and leaves on cantata and the other turns on
and leaves on clarity.  Its still about a 50% reduction in mana
output, though, but at least bards get to rest during down time
and still be doing their best (more or less, depending on how
much Amp helps clarity)
