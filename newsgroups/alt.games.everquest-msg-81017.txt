About 80 total. That's about the maximum viable number for a raid since
after that lag becomes intolerable.

Do it ):o) Practice on Statue if you want confidence, but if he's
already trivial, you're certainly in the right ballpark. Worse that
happens is you lose a little exp.

Vindi pull was flawless. I grabbed agro soon as he arrived, kept it for
the duration. Not even the puller died. Some mobs (like Veli) seen to be
hardcoded to randomly pick on someone other than the MT. Haven't really
done statue enough recently to comment on whether he's the same.

>What did AoW drop?

Barb mask and 2 rings.
