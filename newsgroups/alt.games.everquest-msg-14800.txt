Oh, come on! Spoken like a true cheater. That's like saying the poker
player who counts/marks cards is "just playing the game".
Circumventing THE RULES is CHEATING. Tell me, does the fact that a
basketball player CAN punch the guy with the ball mean that he's "just
playing the game" if he decides to do so to gain the advantage? Or
Boxers punching below the belt? Or a pitcher throwing a spitball?
Knowingly violating the rules isn't okay simply because it's possible.

Again: If it's a bug that gives you and advantage, and you KNOW it's a
bug, and you KNOW the rules say not to exploit bugs, you're cheating.
Period. You're not "just playing the game", you're exploiting the
game's flaws.

If it's a single player game, cheat to your heart's content. But in a
multiplayer game, ANY cheat affects EVERY player in some way.
