Again, since you seem to be a bit impaired ... go to Everyquest.com. You
know, the "official" site you are referring to?

See how they point readers to the interview? In essence, an official
endorsement of the information revealed therein? And - brace yourself - note
how they say "Jeff reveals what the new character race and class will be."

Wait? How can they say such a thing? Unless .... no, it can't be.

On the official site they say Jeff reveals the new race and class in an
interview, and then point you to that interview, and in the interview he
says it will be the Kerrans and Beastmaster. I cannot believe it!

And then, crazily enough, Abashi posted the following on the message board:

"That said, in response to this one, "Kerrans" isn't entirely accurate. The
cat-people of Odus were dubbed "Kerrans" by the Erudites during the process
of their segregation. They do not call themselves "Kerrans". The cat people
of Luclin are actually known as the "Vah Shir", the nobility among the cat
people. The tale of how they ended up on Luclin is pretty interesting, but
I'll leave that for the web site

As for your other questions, yes, other races will be able to become
Beastlords, but there are certain limitations involved. More info will be
released in the future. As for the other classes that the Vah Shir can
play -- we're not ready to announce that just yet."

Well, what do you know?
