I played AO for about 6 months a year ago, when they put out their free 
offer.  It was reasonably busy, I'd guess a couple thousand people per 
server, most of them on the free accounts, though, and you'd constantly 
hear the moaning of the people who'd been playing forever, and of the 
people who came back now that it was free, about how different it was 
from the old community.  They came up with what (to me) was the most 
brilliant idea ever for funding the game; they sold ad space to real 
world advertisers on the in game billboards.  Fanta, Coke Zero, 
Alienware... since it's an SciFi game the ads were mostly appropriate, 
and fun to spot.  If you paid (and you had to, to get expansions, the 
monthy was only free with the base game) you had the option to turn the 
ads off, but that really meant you'd still see the ad space, just 
fictional content in them, to me the real world stuff was better.

At any rate, their numbers can't have been all that good, because 
despite having a couple thousand people playing per server, they had 
only two servers.  Assume 10 times as many people are playing 
occaisionally as I observed, multiply by two, and you still have 40K 
peeps, thats not going to make a blip on a graph that includes WOW.
