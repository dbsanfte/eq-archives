My own horror story was trying to buy *one* of a stackable item, by
using Ctrl-click on the "purchase" button, and my finger slipping and
hitting Shift-click instead, buying a whole stack. Fortunately, it
wasn't too expensive a mistake (it was just Innoruuk's Kiss of Death),
but to add insult to injury, when I removed one from the stack, the rest
of the stack poofed, since it's LORE. So no re-selling it. :/
