Heh, Im having the same problem with my Iksar Necro (now 21). Unfortunately
the ruleset on the FV server prevents either of the mentioned solutions from
working (one day I'll meet an Ogre who can understand me - but by the time
my Human language is good enough and is his/hers I'll most likely have no
need for the lvl 20 pet spell). Since my pet is currently level 16 at most -
ie 5 levels below me- I am really finding it tough for the first time in ny
Necro's life - I have to do the tanking for him - step back to cast then in
again. This works well even up to white cons unless I get an add wandering
by in which case its hope that I can get a Feign Death off, and it works.

This has become so annoying since I hit 21 that I created a Rogue on the AB
server and have him up to 16 now.

Anyway, good luck, Jakugg, er I mean Uxivar (sp?).
