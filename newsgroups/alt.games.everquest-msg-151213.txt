All,
	Well, I think I'm going to take the plunge and buy Everquest
and start playing.  With all of the different software packages out
there, which one would be best?  I'd like to get the complete set (I
know there were some expansion packs).  Would the Everquest Trilogy
give me the most bang for the buck?

	Thanks, and looking forward to playing!
