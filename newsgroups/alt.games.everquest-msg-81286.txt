Hmmm, maybe we're different, but in almost EVERY case on a raid I'm the 
first one rezzed.  As a bard all I have to is to have manasong ready to 
go, as soon as I pop up at my corpse, I join the rez group and sing mana 
for the clerics, and the one enchanter who is rezzed.  
Generally, if it's a big wipeout bards invite casters as they're rezzed 
in, and pump mana to speed up the process.  Rezzing the enchanter first 
doesn't make as much sense, since they have to med up enough to cast 
clarity on the clerics first, while a single bard will can be pumping C2 
levels of mana to a full group immediately.  (Of course once I get my AE 
manasong I'll be a recovery GOD I tell you!)
My guild has 4 bards, and on any given raid you can expect two to be 
there, but I'm alwasy the first one rezzed.  I think it's because I 
consent camp-out cleric and other draggers immediately and because I 
immediately start manasong and invite rezzing clerics and one enchanter as 
soon as they are rezzed.  Nothing gets me more frustrated than a CR that 
takes too long.
Total sidebar--After a particularly nasty wipeout in VP this weekend we 
decided to run back and summon corpses, since we didn't need to be in the 
Phara pull spot with only 18 and no wizards.  The problem was that all the 
melee were bound in ShadowHaven.  I grabbed my spare drum out of the bank, 
our porter grabbed 5 of us, and we ported into Skyfire.  I gave quick run 
instructions to the group (assign leader, tell everyone to auto-follow 
leader, steer leader through tells), started up song of travel, and went 
to 3rd person view to watch for people falling back.  It was a beautiful 
site to see, all 6 of us bombing along at bard-speed in perfect formation.  
I love it when a CR comes together.  Took less than 5 minutes from the 
time we were told to head to VP until the 6 of us were in zone waiting for 
the necro to summon us.
