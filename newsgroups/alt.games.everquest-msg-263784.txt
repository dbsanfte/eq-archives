Then you go find a single mob that isn't walking around with a group
of friends, or you take on a group where each single member isn't so
hard.  It would be nice if there were also non-linked groups that
would still assist if they were close to each other, as opposed to
just if you get close enough for them to aggro you, but in the choice
between that and non-splittable groups, I'll take the groups.
