If you like duoing in a dungeon, you might want to try it with a
Paladin in LGuk sometime after you get your 50% undead slow (39?).
The Paladin can heal himself, so you don't have to, er, dirty your
hands with that sort of thing, and you can laugh in your sleeve as
the Paladin gets beat up tanking for an undead pet.  (This gets to
be even more fun at higher level when you get a rogue pet).
