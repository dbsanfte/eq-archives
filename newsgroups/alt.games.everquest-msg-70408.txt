I would bet that had the druid not been sitting the critter would still be
on the tank.  I find that all the time on my druid or enchanter that's
gotten a bit high on the hate list.  Sometimes it takes up to 10% of melee
damage before the tank is finally at the top of the hate list and I can
safely sit down.  Sometimes even more.

In Fear critters make a bee-line to my enchanter even before I cast ANYTHING
if I dare sit down, even if a tank's been beating on it a few seconds.

Root gives you a chance to sit and med until it breaks.  It doesn't ADD
aggro.  It may not last long enough to 100% REMOVE aggro, but it doesn't ADD
any.

There are exceptions, obviously, to any broad statement, but I doubt if root
has much to do with it.  Sometimes critters just DO NOT like a particular
character, no matter what they and the tank do to fix the aggro.  In FG the
other night I cast a slow on a critter very near the start of the fight.
That almost never aggros the first cast.  If it doesn't stick and I have to
cast again, that's a different story.  But this one critter...I hit it with
slow (tash first is usually a bad idea in higher levels) and BAM that guy
was on me...with me just standing there (I know better than to melee or
cast) and the warrior beating on its back for about a minute.  I don't think
that guy ever stopped hammering me.  No one, unfortunately, thought to root
the critter.  Folks have come to depend on me for CC and root is ghetto-CC
(although damned handy).

An enchanter is my main.  I'm very familiar with being hit.  I'm very
familiar with what aggro means.  Since I take a lot more damage per hit than
the warrior in my group, and I take damage most fights, I daresay that I
know at least as much about it as he does.
