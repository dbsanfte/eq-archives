_____________________

- Fixed an issue with some casters having more hitpoints than intended 
after the last patch.

Didn't notice this one.

- NPCs should no longer be pushed through walls as easily.


Really really noticed this one.  As easily, though?  NPC's should never 
ever be capable of getting pushed thru walls.  Doesn't make any sense.

- Fixed an issue that was causing problems with some NPC pathing.

OK, some NPC pathing, I noticed some troubles with that.  But worse, PET 
pathing.  I guess its the same problem.  I hope whatever issue was 
fixed, this was the problem with pets too.  Oh, and incedentally I hope 
this was an actual fix, and not one of the classic patch to patch a 
patch which will require another patch etc, taking up eventually all of 
July before they just restore whatever was originally working.

- Players should now be receiving the same kind of push from NPC attacks 
as the did prior to our last patch.

OK, I didn't notice this change.  The big change was that NPC's recieved 
less push FROM PCs, and from pets.  NPC's pushing players is rarely a 
big issue.

- Players using custom UIs should no longer crash when clicking on an 
item link.

I'm just not a custom UI kind of guy; I get how this could be fun to 
tinker with, and how you could actually end up with an EQ screen that 
works better for your character... but its not something I find amusing. 
  That said, I'm endlessly amused by people who's custom UI's get messed 
up, seemingly every other patch.

- Two handed weapons should no longer show up as unusable if you have a 
shield equipped.


But... they are unusable if you have a shield equipped!.  Unless there's 
a three handed race I'm not currently aware of, perhaps from some 
expansion that COmbine hasn't opened yet...  I know, I know, they mean 
you should see them as usable, even though you'll naturally have to 
unequip the shield first.  But it still sounds funny.

Were there other patch issues that this isn't listed as dealing with?

Oh yeah, the nerf to SK and paladins, where our AA aren't supposed to 
affect our weapon procs.  Didn't work, and yet it seems they aren't 
"fixing" it with this patch either.  Here's hoping it gets swept under 
the rug and stays broken.
