Shaman, the other healer/sow/damage dealing sister class of the druid 
which gets a pretty good pet too. They can solo pretty well. Then
wizard would probably be next.. or maybe above shaman. Wizards can
solo pretty well eventually at higher levels with jboots and quading
or whatever (saw one doing it on othmir) but both of those kinda have
levels where they are not so hot at soloing I think.

Sk is probably the best soloing melee type, then ranger next. 

There is a large difference between classes that CAN solo and classes
for whom it is a viable choice which at times gets them MORE xp.
Really the 3 you mention are the only classes that are ever that way
where for periods of levels or all the way to 60 soloing is sometimes
the best choice. Like I remember for my druid camping the 2 dwarf
spawns in front of kaladim or a fast spawn like delin or whatever was
the best xp for me up to level 45 or so so I did them from level 34 -
45.. which is kind of long while and a time of struggle for other
classes.
