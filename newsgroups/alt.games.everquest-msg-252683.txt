Were they better or worse than the rogue and monk spells?  And which did 
you prefer, the 44 or the 52?

Melee tend to benefit from new expansions due to mudflation; the new 
expansion tends to deliver higher dam/delay weapons, better armor for a 
given amount of effort.  Those features don't affect casters who, for 
the most part, don't hit things with weapons nor survive a beating long 
regardless of what they are wearing.  I don't think LOY did this so 
much, though, never heard of people working their butts off to get the 
new LOY gear, and selling off their old POP crap.
