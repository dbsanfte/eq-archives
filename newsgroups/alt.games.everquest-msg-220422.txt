Stamina.  Especially if you're on a budget.   Many of the rogue races have
very low starting stamina, and your first challenge will be getting it over
100.   After that, any left overs generally look good in strength.
Strength doesnt' make a huge difference, but if you're not looking for the
joy of seeing that max possible backstab, why would you be playing a rogue?
; )

As a personal thing, I really don't like large races.  The shorter the
better.   Stats do not mean a whole lot either.  If you're looking long term
then you're talking raid game, at which point the insane gear will max every
stat no matter what you chose at creation.   Even looking short term though
these days, twink gear with incredible stats is damn dirt cheap, even on a
budget you'll have tons better gear than my rogue was wearing working her
way up.

Good stamina.  Mask of the Deciever reduces the night blind problem
(although I still hate night blindness) and the size problem.  The
powergamers choice.  I've never met a barbarian rogue that I really liked.

As I said above, the stats are pretty meaningless.  Racial faction has not
been a huge issue for anyone since Velious came out.   Real downside, every
rogue can easily get a Mask of the Deciever and turn into a dark elf.

Pretty much exactly what you said.  I don't like the idea of dwarven rogues.
Another powergamer choice, although I've met a few good ones.

As above, the stats are pretty meaningless.   I might have taken a gnome if
I was rolling my rogue now. I really miss the short races, and the female
gnomes look great in the old models.

And yes, Gnomes of all classes can do tinkering if they want.

See above for DE / Gnome

Halflings.... ew.

Cat rogues generally scream twink at me.   Especially since everyone feels
compelled to come up with a stupid pun name, like Meow 'nassassin.

See above.

I really hate the night blindness.   I've thrown on the Erudite mask to try
it in various locations, and it still sucks horribly.
