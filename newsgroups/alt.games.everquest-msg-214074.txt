Along with the slate, you also need a notarized application, obtained at
the same time as the citizenship slate, from the Registrar. The slate
alone will not get you your Recruit cloak. My Ogre on Drinal had to run
through the quest 3 times before becoming an ally with the Registrar.
The way I was told to check was to ask the Registrar for a replacement
slate. She will tell you that you have more work to do, or something
similar, if your faction is not high enough. If that's the case, you
have to run through the quest again.

I realize the quest weapons are not as good as the Polished Steel Ulak I
bought in the bazaar, but I am enjoying the quests as part of the
roleplaying aspect. I feel like I've become a citizen with my Ogre and
will try to accomplish the same thing with my Barbarian.
