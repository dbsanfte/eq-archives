    I was traveling form Steamfont to Gfay Sat. night (Usually a safe run)
but this run was interupted by some badass White wolf by the name of "The
Spirit of Malevolence" he coned red to me (51 Druid).  He came up behind me,
blinded me then kicked my ass.
     I was wondering if anyone has ever heard this MoB before or just might
be a GM I don't know.  I contacted a GM about it cause I was wondering about
it and I talked to 3 different GM's and NONE of them ever heard of it.  All
they told me Lfay wasn't really a zone to be in.

This is all I seen when I could see again (at bind point):
