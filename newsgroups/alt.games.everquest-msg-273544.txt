When I started my Dark Elf Enchanter I decided not to use the POK books
for travel.  This was after the boat gnomes took over from the boats so
I didn't have to wait for them.  It was great.  I learned much more of
Nek forest than I ever had before - my main at the time was a Dark Elf
too and I hadn't properly explored Nektulos with him.  When I looked
beyond Nek I still stayed close by because I didn't want to be running
back if I died.  So I explored the commonlands and befallen etc.  I
think that it significantly increased my enjoyment of the game.

As an aside: It all fell apart at level 12 when I wanted to get to
Kurn's Tower.  I couldn't work out the map for the Oceon of Tears and
so I had to explore to find the other boat gnome.  I foolishly assumed
that such an important zone for travel would be of neutral alignment so
I stayed in my Dark Elf form and was attacked by an Elf.  I was very
close to dieing and (again foolishly) jumped in the sea to get away.  I
tried gate a number of times before it got off uninterrupted and then
landed at my bind point.  I immediately fell unconscious!  I recovered
and fainted two or three more times before I could start to walk to a
safer spot to recover.  Talk about close!  I then used the POK to get
to Kurn's Tower.  Maybe I shouldn't have - I'm sure that I would have
achieved much more satisfaction had I got there on foot.

After a point, though, you would struggle to get groups if you went
everywhere on foot and there was another option.  You'd get a group in
one zone and they might get bored there and want to go somewhere else.
If that place was too far away for the group to get there on foot you'd
probably be left behind and lose the group - or have to temporarily
suspend your restriction (just this one time - assuming it doesn't
happen next time you play)
