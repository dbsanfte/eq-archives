society doesn't have to limit breeding. there are alternatives. in some
countries, parents stop receiving benefits after having N children. this is a
good way to discourage abusing the system by having more children than you can
financially handle. similar regulations could be put in place for parents that
have a big chance of having children with bad genetic defects. they're still
allowed to have children, but they'll need to be prepared to deal with the
consequences without society around to bail them out for their irresponsible
decisions.

i agree. however, at some reasonable point, i should be allowed to tell you,
"no, you can't have any more of my money. helping fund 10 of your children is
enough, no more."
