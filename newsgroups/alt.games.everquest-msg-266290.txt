...although I don't know why I am excited because being an Aussie means the
game doesn't hit our shelves till the 11th or 12th. Anyway - I am excited
for you guys, don't forget to drop out of game to post every now and again
to keep us geographically challenged ones posted.

And if anyone is playing a Dirge/Troubadour can you let me know if these
"bards" can cast spells on the move aka EQ1. I am planning on a Ratonga
Coercer unless Dirges can cast on the move ;-)
