The band vs undead part isn't really as important as you think.  Most of the
damage a cleric does with the hammer comes not from its melee stats (which are
pretty decent even without the bane, and better still with it) but from the
proc.  Yaulp helps because it gives you 75 extra dex, on top of the 25 dex the
hammers sport plus a haste.  Due to lack of dual weild and dual attack and
melee damage bonus, the eye popping (for people without Elemental drop
weaponry) stats a melee sees when you link them a hammer really aren't all that
big a deal after all. Then take into account the fact that melee skill is
capped at an abyssimal 175, so you can't even hit mobs all that much or for
anythign close to your full damage potential. But the procs are frequent and
unresistable and happen whether you are hitting the target or not, dishing out
a quite respectable amount of damage to any target regardless of whether you
can actually connect with a weapon at all.

Sadly, although the proc rate does bump up with the higher level hammers,
cleric's damage output relative to mobs barely DB to his level peaks right
there at 56, where his pet is doing decent melee damage, he's doing great melee
damage, the procs are coming out at a respectable rate and the amount of damage
they do is a big chunk of the HP totals of the mobs.  Level up, and those
barely DB mobs get more AC so you can't hit them as hard via melee, the pet
stops hitting so well, and their HP total skyrockets so your higher proc rate
doesn't really keep pace.
