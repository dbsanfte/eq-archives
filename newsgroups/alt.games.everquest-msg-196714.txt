It tends to be a self-correcting problem in most cases. Unless you
e-bayed, anyone who's got the money to twink should have the knowledge
to know what their new class has to do. The stereotypical necro/druid
that solo'd to 60, couldn't get a group and decided to twink an alt
instead is probably an exception.

... because a twinked warrior is a serious killing machine? <g>

SOE, especially with PoP, has to shoulder a lot of the blame for that.
They designed a system that segregates players according to level,
don't be surprised when people try to level up as conveniently as
possible so they can group a new class with their friends again. 

It can be a problem I suppose, if people start choosing their
groupmates according to their lvl of twinking or whether they have KEI
or not. I've only seen that once in an FM giant group, where a group
member said that he wouldn't group again with someone LFG because he
wasn't a twink and had shitty equipment. He left after the other
person was invited and wasn't missed <g>.
