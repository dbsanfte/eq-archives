One of the *most* disgusting and disturbing things about the SoL release
is the new model for the trolls. And no, it doesn't matter to me that I
can leave my graphics on the old models. I'll still know that this is
what everyone *else* will be seeing, and I would like to experience the
other new character models, textures, etc. so I guess I'm stuck with it.
But they seriously dropped the ball there. 
  If Brad was serious when he talked about wanting to do more polls and
get more player feedback, I'd like to see them take a poll of all the
people with active troll characters and ask us how we feel about the new
troll model. I bet it would be a near unanimous "no" vote on it. Bad
fuck up there, VI.
