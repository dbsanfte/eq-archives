I did 3 total LDoNs yesterday...  On the first I was on my 32 Cleric in a group
where the next highest level was 28.  On the average, for every 7 mobs we took
down, 6 were green to me and 1 was light blue.  LOL  Obviously that dungeon was
completely based on the average levels of the majority of the folks I was
with...  I'm guessing the same was probably true for your group too...

My other 2 LDoNs were on my 55 Druid and we flew through them...  :)  3
Dungeons, 3 Successes...  

Sorry to hear about your problems...  I have had days like that too.  :(
