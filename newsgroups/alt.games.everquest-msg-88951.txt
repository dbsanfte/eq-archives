Funny you should mention this. In addition to the unpredictable music,
my F8 Target Nearest NPC ability is also now working intermittently and
unpredictably. I checked to see if anyone else is having this problem
and they are. I can live with the music issue but not being able to
target mobs quickly (and a lot of times during big combats it's a UI
nightmare to manually target) could be deadly.
