I guess my thought is that they shouldn't have to be *competing*.  Of course a
ranger isn't a warrior.  Neither is a paladin or a shadowknight.  They
shouldn't be better fighters, period the end, (IMO).  If they *are* going to be
better fighters, take away their spells and other abilities.  Oh yeah, then
they'd be .... warriors.  
Druids and shaman aren't clerics either.  Yes, they can *fill in* if a cleric
isn't available and can be quite adequate, but they shouldn't be *better
healers* inherently.
