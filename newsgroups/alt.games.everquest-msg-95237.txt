ROTFLMAO!! Mages are one of the easiest classes to solo. I got my
mage to 35 in 11 days played quite easily. And I made over 1kpp
farming stuff in the warrens. All solo and no powerleveling. I twinked
him with 100pp and some raw silk armor, after that it was all on his own.

I have both a monk and a mage and the mage was way easier to solo.
At one point in my 20's I could kill 4 blues on one bar of mana.
