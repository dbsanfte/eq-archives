Asheron's Call is there, too, although you have to use the search page to
find it.  That's a fun one to read--they came up with a pretty decent game,
but when you read the horrible mistakes they made in development, you'll be
amazed that it ever made it out the door.

It's an interesting contrast with Mythic.  Basically, Mythic did pretty much
everything right, and ended up with a good game.  Turbine did pretty much
everything wrong, and ended up with a good game.

Poor management does seem to be quite common in the MMORPG industry.  From
what we can see as players, I'd say that DAoC and CoH look like they are well
managed, and pretty much everyone else (among released games...I'm not
considering WoW and EQ2 yet) has had problems.
