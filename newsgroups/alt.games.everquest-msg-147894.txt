I hear that it is possible for defense to improve when you are hit by
certain traps, namely those that "hit" like a mob.  One such trap
appears near a bookshelf in the Tower of Frozen Shadow (Velious).

My question:

is this really a practical way to seek defense skill improvement?  How
much does that trap hit for?  Are there other traps that work
similarly?

Many thanks
