Brewing, Baking and Fishing... Woodelf Druid (best foragers... easy access
to zones with speciality drops)

Smithing... Dwarf Cleric or Paladin (high wisdom, high strength)

Jewelcraft... Highelf Enchanter (can also assist your other trades by
enchanting various metals, clay, etc)

Fletching... Ranger, any race

Tailoring... Bard (track, Selos, good melee, useful songs for killing LOTS
of lawn-trash greenies)

Alchemy... Barb Shammie for best Wisdom

Pottery... Rogue, any race... poison vials... really easy to advance, so
high Int/Wis not a priority

Tinkering... Gnome Necro... everyone should have at least one necro in their
list of Alts ;o)

If you're looking for a group of characters that can support each others'
tradeskills, then look for a particular religious group where you can get
one charater to a level where he/she can Imbue for the others.

For example...
Innoruuk Darkelves... Cleric for Smithing and Imbues, Enchanter for
Jewelcraft and Enchanting Ore, Mage/Necro for Tailoring (pets are useful for
farming large quantities of furs/silks and Temper components)
