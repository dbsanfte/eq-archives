What you just described:

PlayerA goes to 50 raids, in a point system would have 50 points.
PlayerB goes to 5 raids, in a point system would have 5 points.

PlayerA's dream item drops.  /rand 1 32000.  PlayerB wins and then isn't
seen at the next 9 raids.

I've seen that exact thing happen.  

You're asking for people to get screwed for being more dependable for raids
rather than being rewarded like they should be.  That's just goofy, and
rather selfish.
