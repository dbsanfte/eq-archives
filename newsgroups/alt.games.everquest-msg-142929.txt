Don't overreact. History of EQ tells us that just because one GM does
something it doesn't mean it will ever happen again regardless of
'precedent'. EQ GMs are *defined* by their inconsistency.

It happened once, that's kinda bad (but not horrible, that many
clerics have their epic now and that's a GOOD thing). Until it happens
repeatedly, it's not worth worrying about.
