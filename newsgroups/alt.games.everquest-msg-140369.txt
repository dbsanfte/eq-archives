    Also available in the Bazaar on my server as of last night. ;-)

    Yes, the gnome quest. I'd place it above two groups, if only to make
sure that unmezzables are offtanked quickly, though.

    Actually, drops off Draco in Fear. So you have to be Demi-capable, just
like for the Girdle.

> Supple Scale Armband - solo

    Remember who the armband is for - a wizard. I don't see a wizard soloing
the Warlord area in KC anytime soon. ;-)

    I think you cross your fingers and hope for loots of this quality, and
not crap like the two hander. Both the bracer and the gloves are fantastic,
and will stay on the people that get them for a hell of a long time. Which
would I prefer to see? As a cleric, I view fights from the perspective that
as long as we keep the main tank alive we will win eventually - so I favour
the bracer.

    There's two of these for sale in our Bazaar. One was in the 2 K range.

> Dreadfang's Hide - CT pickup group, maze. 3 people can do it.

    There's been one for sale all week on my server, but nobody has been
willing to pay 16 K for it yet.

> Boots of Flowing Slime - Pickup CT group

    Again, two for sale on my server at 70 K. The number will rise, as
Planks is camped 24-7 - literally. When the North Americans leave, there's
always an Asian group ready to move in.

> Frozen Orb - 2 people. also aout 100pp to buy

    Wow, your server is cheap! On ours it's 500 to 1000 pp.

I can think of on Quellious that have killed him. I know there's a few
guilds that are in the process of trying him, too.
