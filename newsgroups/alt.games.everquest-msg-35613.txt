My only gripe is that *each* listener "hears" a *different*
mangling of what you said.

I think it would make more sense if the garbling was done on
the "speaker's" side, since he's the one slurring his words,
and every listener heard the same mangled speech.

This would also allow all listeners to chuckle together over the
same unintended utterances, instead of one guy laughing at how
your slurred speech made you unwittingly speak an obscenity
or other amusing "speako", while the other listeners only got
to hear nonsense.
