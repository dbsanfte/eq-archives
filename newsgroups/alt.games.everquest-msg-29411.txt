One thing to keep in mind, even with veterans planar raids can go
horribly horribly awry.  Make sure you budget your time to be there a
few hours PAST the scheduled end of raid in case the tragic occurs.

One suggestion I can make from a raid that went sour recently, make
sure you stagger your groups entering the plane.  We had 24 people go
LD at the fear portal and we were all mass slaughtered because the
stinking zone didnt crash, it just killed all our connections.  One
second we were escorting clerics to our camp spot, then immediate 'you
have been disconnected' boxes.

The GMs just laughed and said tough, it was our fault for all being in
the same place at the same time.  GG Verant!  /bird
