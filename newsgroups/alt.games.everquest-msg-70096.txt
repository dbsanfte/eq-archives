I will say I am more than pleased with the changes to the barbarian
model, ESPECIALLY the armor...  for 38 or so levels (just after
getting full banded, and eventually some upgrades, like misc Totemic,
etc)  looked like a walking tin can, and with the exception of the
Runed Circlet, everything on my head looked like a bear head,
including an Iksar skull helm from the LOIO fort...

My only issue now is instead of standing tall and proud, my poor
shammy looks more like a Mafioso goon in stance and posture... but
with the horned helm,  Shield of Falsehood, and various 1h weapons, I
don't seem to get bothered for SoW as much as before )
