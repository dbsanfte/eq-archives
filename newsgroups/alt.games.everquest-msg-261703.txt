Oops, so they are.  I knew its a 10th of a second.... but its been a long
time since I used a fast pause (/pause 20 AoW rotations!), and on the
contrary very recently that I had to call a longer AE (They all tend to be
about 1 minute recasts now). So I guess im just used to thinking in 3
numbers for the pauses.

I don't use pauses in hotkeys very often (the only time I do, is for calling
mobs AE's.. so I only need 3 lines, and don't need to squeeze pauses into
the same lines as other commands)...

But i do remember pause being quirky.. and even though you'd think it being
at the end executes it last, it got executed first.
Did i imagine that, is that how it was, how it still is?

Yes I know some spells have a longer recast.  Cleric nukes.. shamans canni
and turg etc.

No i didn't forget it. I was just giving him a general idea, and making him
aware of the 2.2 delay in addition to any spells delay (which I did
mention).
Without knowing what spell he wants to hotkey, its impossible to make a
fully working "pause" hotkey script anyway.

The 3 seconds was just a small safeguard for the 2.2 really (and not taking
into account the spells recast).. because with lag and the like, a 22 pause
would not work for most people, even on a spell with zero refresh timer.

In the dark days before mass Canni, I vaguelly recall about 6 seconds pause
worked for doing 5 cannis.  Been so long I could be totally off... but for
some reason 6 is what sticks in my mind
