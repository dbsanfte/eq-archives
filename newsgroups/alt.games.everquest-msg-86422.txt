 From my experience it seemed about one scale per hour and we were
pulling all the snakes on our side as they spawned. Maybe in awhile once
everyone who hunts there has scales you'd be able to find people let you
loot them, but for now it seems they need them themselves. It all comes
down to luck though. You could probably kill three and a row and get
what you need in 10 minutes.
