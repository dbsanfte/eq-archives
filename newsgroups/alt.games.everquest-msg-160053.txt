Yep, if you don't have Invis (Warrior/Cleric/Paladin) it can be a bit
tricky to get from the FV port-in to anywhere.  It's pretty easy with
Invis tho, less than half of the drachnids See Invis so you just have
to be a bit careful to /con nearby mobs as you move, my Druid has not
yet come under attack running up to the LOIO zone despite the tendency
of the drachnids to hang out along the zone wall there.
