Nah - they may have logs but to convict someone for say - kiddie porn or
some other freak shit they need material evidence. They normally seize a
suspects computer quick smart for this.

Not entirely, just a hyped up overstatement. Deleting a file does not
physicall remove data. Eventually it will be overwritten so many times it
will not be recoverable though. Reformatting isn't even the clean slate a
lot of people believe.

True - me neither. I don't do freak shit and couldn't care less about who
reads my crud or listens to my calls.
