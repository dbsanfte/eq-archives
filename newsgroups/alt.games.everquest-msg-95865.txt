    Thank you! :-) I'll snip whatever parts of your analysis I don't have
questions about.

    I assume when the big "upping underused zone" XP bonus patch was done
that some ZEMs changed. Did any get over 100, that you recall?

    Is this also the case at low level? I've been a level one character
grouped with a level 2 character and the split of XP I got was quite small
compared with what I should expect from this, and much closer to the 1/3rd
I'd expect if it were straight levels. (Low level was easiest, I could
visually assess the impact of grouping.)

    Are the race modifiers applied directly to "XP to level", then?
