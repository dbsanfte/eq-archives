Interesting viewpoint, especially in light of your earlier
mock log-post.   I can see your viewpoint, but I dunno.  I
agree that it's a good thing to be a good-will ambassador
for your class.  But on the other hand, it seems a bit harsh
to say the refusing a request is inexcusable.
    Switching gears to heal, because the class I'm
concentrating on right now specializes in these rather than
SoW.  Right now I'm seriously considering make a
more-or-less permanent server change to FV, and finally
picking a cleric as my main.  FV is has alot of good people,
many of whom I've met actually do roleplay.  Yet, with /role
off, I get more heal requests, many of which are very
politely worded, than I can accommodate.  Therefore, I tend
to blow most of them off.  I'm not unfriendly.  I often have
long conversations with people whose characters are either
older or younger than my own, where no begging or asking for
buffs are going on, we simply are enjoying each other's
company.  But treating me like a buff or heal dispenser,
even if they ask nice?  Annoys me.  And I don't think is
inexcusable for me, or a druid, to turn them down
point-blank.
