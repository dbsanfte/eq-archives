I seem ( since last patch ) to crash alot when swapping between 
characters.....before patch could /q and log another account a dozen 
times without a problem. Now everytime I /q  or if I log out by camping 
and switch accounts/characters I seem to get that crash message at 
character selection...or a couple minutes after I get on.

Never had this problem, and I do mean that. If I crashed playing EQ it 
was once maybe 2 times a year. I run Win 2K BTW.
