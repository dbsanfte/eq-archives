Thanks for the replies!  I'm glad I found out about that before I got
in trouble.  I haven't yet gotten my rogue into a group high enough
where there is a master looter, but if I ever get her into one, I'll
try that advice.  Right now I'm hunting bandits in paludal and
everyone seems to have more loot than they can carry.  I think I'll
just ask if they mind if I pp and offer to not loot any dead
mobs..right now they'd be getting the better deal my pp's aren't
usually successful anyway and I wouldn't get any bronze.
Thanks~!
