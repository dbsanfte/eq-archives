Yep, evidently I did not see it yet on Trib because it was done in a
patch, while I saw it in FV on the test and from day one as anon says.

I could have sworn I was just on trib and still no planes armor
though...

The highest verified level I've heard of on FV is probably level 35 so
I'd guess people are 45 or more. People even being 50 does not
guaruntee a planes raid though since you need several things. The most
important is at least one person who knows how to lead a fear raid and
that the other people will listen to. I'm pretty sure there has been
no planes raid on FV yet. 

Really it would be easier for people to start raiding kael than the
planes since you can always just walk casually into kael to CR while
you can't do that in fear or hate and kael could be theoretically
started in on with a couple groups of 50s though not really the more
uber mobs. Will be interesting to see if that happens first on this
new server.
