Not to me it hasn't.  :)

Also a tack on.  Just because a few (t)wits decide to use it doesn't make it
make sense either.

I actually find the examples of variance an argument that the acronym came
after the original word.

Well, because most news readers won't display long links properly (like
yours above demostrated so aptly), I usually do include the text.  It also
makes it easier for lazy people.

Hmm, I'm not sure I like a person who decides to end a usenet post with this
line.  "I'll argue your point, but since I'm thrashing around, I'll ignore
this argument from now on."

>You'll never change your beliefs, nor will I.

Actually, I've been known to change my beliefs or views when proven wrong.
I don't like you assuming what I will or will not do from two exchanges.  If
you are one of those people who will grasp at straws rather than admit
another view is viable, that's certainly your perogative, just don't lump me
with you.

If you had thought that, you shouldn't have responded to my post -- that
would've save more bandwidth.
