I'd much rather lower level zones had Warren loot rules.
The reason I think you'll find it isn't used is that it's hard to get to
unless you are an Erudite. Sure you can port there, that normally costs 10pp
but then how about leaving. Not quite so easy for all races.

The Warren loot rules in Runnyeye would have been great but I'd like to have
seen the zone made easier if that was the case. My 45th level warrior is in
no way safe from death in there.
