Frankly, what did it for me was moving to a new game. I tried
Anarchy Online for about a month; I still have 3 characters there,
but it's really not much more than a Beta. AO did some things
different and maybe that's what I needed. I've played druids, clerics,
and magicians in EQ. Now that I'm back I started a Necro. The time
away, a new char, and new places I hadn't seen before have made EQ
new to me all over again.
