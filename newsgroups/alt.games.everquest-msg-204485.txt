  I had some free time today, so I decided to do the Trep's Shopping 
list quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2200)
for the hell of it. Now, I'd done this several times before, and it 
always gave me decent experience, usually 1.5 to 2 blue bubbles per 
turn-in. (I actually got myself from halfway through 39 to 40 doing it 
ten or fifteen times over the course of a couple of days.)
  Today, though, my experience bar barely moved. I think I may have 
gotten a tenth of a blue bubble, if that. Has this happened for anyone 
else?

I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my
