Nothing wrong with wood elf rogue. A bit weak on sta early on but that's
much less an issue than it was in the days when sta items were hard to
find. Depending on your server, you might consider powerleveling to at
least 20. For one thing, unless you can find groups at lower levels, you
will be unable to raise backstab anyway, other than buying it up at your
trainer. Assuming you have groups available at 20 via ldon you can start
working on your skills then. Also, a soloing rogue's survivability drops
off rather quickly after 20 or so depending on your gear.

BTW, Bristlebane isn't a particularly onerous god to have. He's
tolerated in Neriak when in dark elf illusion, something my Quellious
worshipping bard had problems with. I've had no reason to try Cabilis in
iksar illusion form but I suspect Bristlebane is a god tolerated by all
the other gods, good and evil alike. I'll have to test that theory
sometime. :)
