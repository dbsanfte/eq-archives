I think being part of the rotation team would stop me having fun doing what
I do best at raids (being a monk).. I can keep my group alive versus
Yelinak, Statue, Vindi, King Tormax etc "botting" a cleric

I guess a part of it, our clerics are all raid experienced (as I am, for a
monk).. wheras running my cleric in the cheal rotation, im back to being
n00b.. and have to keep pestering people (who are busy) with n00bish
questions.

Nope we dont ever berate our clerics... heh the servers "number 2" guild had
all their clerics walk out at one point.. they went from regular nToV, to 16
ppl exping in FG heh
