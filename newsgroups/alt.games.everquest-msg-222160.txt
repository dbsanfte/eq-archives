I have noticed while playing my rogue that evade success seems to depend a 
*lot* on timing. It seemed that in order for it to work, I had to make 
darned sure I hit it when neither the mob nor I was swinging. It makes 
sense, I guess, but I don't remember this being so much an issue when a 
played a rogue before.

Is this the way it's always been, or was there a change made to it sometime 
in the recent past?
