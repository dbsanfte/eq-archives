For what it's worth, my 2HS was maxed shortly after I made 40. I made sure of
it. However, once it *was* maxed, I put it away and hardly ever use it because
of taunt and keeping aggro problems, as stated originally.  That said, if I
manage to lay my hands on a Mith 2 Hander, I will certainly abandon the BABS for
it in a New York minute.
