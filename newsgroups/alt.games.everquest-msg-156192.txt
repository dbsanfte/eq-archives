Never, never, never had that problem.  When I still played melee and
hybrids, I loved to pull, and was did it often for groups I was in.  And
I was told by several that I was one of the best they had grouped with. 
Hell, sometime I go wild and pull with my cleric.  I know I ought not
to, but is is so fun!  
    Maybe  I have been in a group or two that tried to shut me down, but
if so, I just shrugged them off, and continued as puller.
