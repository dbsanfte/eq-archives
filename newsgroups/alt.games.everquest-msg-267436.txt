For one thing the work fridge isn't a public place. Its a fridge shared 
by a small number of people, with an additional small number of people 
who have legitimate access to it (cleaning/janitorial/managerial staff).

If the general public is accessing it they are where they aren't 
supposed to be, and given how many lunches she loses, we can be pretty 
sure its not random punks off the street sneaking in.

Even in 1st grade I had to leave my lunch in an unsecured location where 
it was possible for anyone in the class to take it. I know -I- didn't 
have a private locked locker in grade 1. As I recall it was a cubby in 
the back of the room. I had to leave my coat, shoes, and mittens too. 
All unprotected. While mitten, boot, and lunch thefts were an occasional 
problem, it wasn't a chronic one. We didn't live in paranoid fear of 
eachother, we didn't drag all our muddy, wet, dripping, smelly 
belongings everywhere to prevent someone from taking them. And we 
shouldn't have too. Even in grade 1 the expectation was that our fellow 
students knew better than to steal. (More often then not the stolen 
lunches and mittens etc were accidental.)

It sounds like you think a mechanic should be expected to lockdown his 
tool box every time he changes screwdrivers and sticks his head under a 
hood? If -I- was that mechanic, I'd either expect management to assist 
finding the theif, or I'd find a different shop to work in.
