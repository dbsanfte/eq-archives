I'd like to see instanced content without 'zones'. That would be a 
*very* nifty trick. (ie not possible)

But then people could still train you. You just wouldn't get munched by 
the returning train after they zoned.

There are other exploits too. Consider I pull a train, and then drop 
them, and they are 'returning'. Provided they don't all arrive home 
simultaneously, I could re-pull the first one to get home and switch to 
'idle', and since all his friends were still 'returning' it would be a 
single pull.

The presumption there is that the kiter is a group member. Its a pulling 
method, not a ks technique.
