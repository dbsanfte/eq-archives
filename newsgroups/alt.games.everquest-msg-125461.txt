That is a good question.  The Bind Wound Ability is not the same as heal.
It binds 5pts per skill level (I think) and requires bandages to work.  At
low levels (for newbie untwinked char) these bandages are expensive for the
number that it takes to raise this skill.  I didn't even start practicing
this skill until I was level 27 with my first character.

If you get your skill up it could be helpful in situations where you are low
on mana.  However, what I've wondered is wether the time used to bind would
have been better spent regenning mana.  It takes quite a while to Bind Wound
and usually requires several applications to get HP up to 50%.  Would this
time be better spent medding and then using a heal spell?  Also, you can
only bind to 50% so after that you would still need to "heal" in additiona
to Bind Wound.

Anyone out there ever crunched the numbers???
