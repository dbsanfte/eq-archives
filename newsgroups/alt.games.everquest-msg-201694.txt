OK upfront I'll say Im likely biased to ranger, its my main. Im also not
going to be able to disuss over lvl 50 stuff cos I havent got there yet.

I find it invaluable and miss it greatly when I dont have it. The
tracksort by distance is exceptionally useful....

Its convenient to pull, with space bowkiting is reasonable - albeit more 
tov lower the HP of a mob to a level you can take it in melee. As a ranger
you have snare, root and a few DDs and minor Dot to hit it with. I used to
arrow kite tigers near the windmill in LOIO quite a bit. With the massive
drop in bow costs you can get excellent bows dirt cheap, with fletching
certain arrows that are better than shop bought become cheaper than shop
bought rapidly.

> Finally, how practical is it to solo with a ranger?

Exceptionally IME. At low levels everyone bitched at me saying oh you cant
play a ranger solo above lvl 10, then it raised to oh you cant above the
teens, then to oh what we actually meant was high end game above 40 and so
on.. None of these predictions came true. At low level I could tank with
many of them. POssibly the lack of plate stuff might be an issue now with
twinking relatively easy and established servers filtering top end gear
steadily downwards. But in my banded and patchwork I felt I did OK. My
slow progression was my time slots for play not my in game class issue.

I dont know whether its the bst solo class and the necros in my guild
assure me its not, but it is a practical one where you can achieve the
levelling if you work on it at a reasonable rate.

Pick the right areas to hunt and you can level with the best of them solo.
The combinastion of melee-ish ability and a mana bar with a healing spell
makes a difference. Hit the level where your fear animal spell is
available and you are in gimp solo levelling straight to lvl 50 (and
higher according to many here). I did 25 plus in assorted animal areas,
hit DSP at 30 or so, 35 plus in GD, 40 plus in stonebrunt and EW. and
still going.
