Obviously my one of my posts haven't gotten through, cause I am still
screwed. Two of my computers are fried and the remaining one can't run EQ.
so it really doesn't matter what is said. I can't attend any of them anyway.
And who here plays on the Ayonae Ro server? Well on the ayo ro server my
guild has said in emails that the events in WC usually last about 10 to 15
minutes, because some lamo goes and kills the despawn trigger and ruins the
even for the timer to respawn. And really get right down to it, do you
always drop your group cause you hear something cool is going on? I wouldn't
mind doing that but I appreciate getting groups post 50 ).
