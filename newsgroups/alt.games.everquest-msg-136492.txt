That very ugly-looking word is the way Section 33 of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms is commonly referred to.   Sections 2
and 7-15 of the Charter list what most people think of as "their
rights" under the law.   Section 33 allows federal or provincial
legislatures to make a law which does limit those rights.  Thus you
could make a law that limits freedom of expression *notwithstanding*
(i.e. disregarding) the statement made in the Charter.  Such a law may
exist for a maximum of 5 years (renewable).

What some Alberta politicians are threatening to do is enact a law
which would invalidate a federal law, using Section 33.

While it may seem shocking that a government has the constitutional
right to disregard its own declaration of rights, my research so far
shows this to be fairly common.

The full text of the Charter is available at
http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/

The Charter is considered to be Appendix B of our constitution
(Constitution Act, 1982), and as such any constitutional ruling would
be incomplete if the Charter is not included.   Like the US
constitution, ours is subject to interpretation and court precedent.
Since 1992 sexual orientation has been "read into" Section 15 of the
Charter, and that precedent has been firmly established since.

An interesting note here is that you must read sexual orientation as a
prohibited grounds of discrimination in Section 15 to justify invoking
Section 33 in the way Alberta proposes.
