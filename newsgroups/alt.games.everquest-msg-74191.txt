Henry V,
I agree with you in your thought process.  IMHO I think that post 50 EQ
Sucks.  I work, yes work for some of the EQ people that dont know what that
is =)  Therefore I don't have 16-18 a day to play the game.  I think that
you can find pickup groups up until level 50 after that most zones that even
have pickup zones are groups of friends.  With that they don't want
outsiders joining their group.  They better find ways of getting the $10.00
a month customer to be able to do things in pickup groups or solo post 50 or
lookout when Shadowbane comes out!! I already hear that DAoC allows every
class to solo effectively and does not penalize them for not being to go on
those assasine 72 hour camps!!!
