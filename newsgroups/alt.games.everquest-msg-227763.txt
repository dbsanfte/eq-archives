Im not terribly hot on Compaqs. Gateways are much much better, very
reliable. Compared to my previous two computers which constantly had
problems and crashed often. This one after a year still runs as well and has
never crashed (without purpose, say from buggy third party apps).

More RAM is an absolute requirement. The video card as others are saying
isnt a powerhouse but EQ isnt a graphically intensive game. Well perhaps it
is but thats due to the horrible inefficiant graphics engine. If you want to
be able to go on raids with 72 people and experiance no lag then yeah you
will probably need a better video card but getting more RAM will help on
that a lot more.
