Just started a bard and really like it... A lot to do though and very
overwelming at times.  Here is my idea.  How about when a bard is singing a
song that you acually here different songs or different drum beats.  If your
solo then only you can here it or if your in a group then the whole group
can here it.  I think the effect would be greater as far as looks and sounds
are concerned instead of him just opening his mouth or pounding on his drum.
Just my 2 cents
