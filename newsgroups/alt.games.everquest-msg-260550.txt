There are three types of chests that can be opened.  One type can only be
opened by Rogues or Bards (mechanical trapped), one type can only be opened
by wisdom casters (cursed trapped), and one type can only be opened by
finger wagglers (magical trapped).

Rogues / bards do thiers via skills.  They need to use in succession "Sense
traps" "Disarm traps" "Pick lock" then type /open.

Casters and priests do thiers via spells.   There are specific spells sold
by the adventure merchants that will allow you to sense / disarm / lockpick
chests.  You need all 3 spells of your type to open the chest completely.
Reebo's Greater Augury / Reebo's Greater Clensing / Reebo's Greater Exorcism
are the three spells for your class, priest.   (Note there are lesser,
normal and greater versions of the spells.   Most people skip the lesser
versions and only buy the greater ones, if they buy them at all.)   They can
be purchased at any LDoN camp from spending adventure points.

As you already noted, you can also try to attack the chest, which results in
the trap automaticly going off (if there is a trap, some rare ones are not)
and has a large chance of destroying whatever was inside the chest.

After opening many chests, I've yet to see one that was worth spending the
adventure points to buy the spells.  (Not to mention the disarm one costs a
17 pp? reagent every time you cast it.)  The most I've gotten so far is
augments, which are the same strength as the ones that drop normally within
an adventure of that level.  (And they're rare.  Usually it's some shitty
potion nobody wants.)    I've heard rumors that "All level 65's, Hard
difficulty" can have "very nice" items in chests... but I've yet to see it
proven.

Lesser remove curse will help you to remove some of the bad effects that can
happen if a chest explodes.   Some high level events also have curse attacks
that need that spell to cure.   It's not something I'd recommend you buy at
the moment, but if you already went ahead and did so, it is not a complete
waste.
