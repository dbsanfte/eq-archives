    Screaming Terror, level 24. Very short duration - a necro can safely
keep two mobs locked down with this, in my experiences. Was supposed to
originally be a Fear spell with a mem blur on it - you Fear the add, it runs
away without remembering why so no adds come - but that couldn't be
programmed at the time. It would have also been incredibly potent in that
form - see an outdoor camp of three, ST away two mobs (nothing comes for you
because no hate propagation), kill third, then repeat until camp broken.

    Get back up to 93% XP, it's a post-50 spell, it requires a reagent
obtained by Sacrificing (killing without possibility of XP res) someone
above 46 and not level 60. Typically, someone who wants to quit EQ entirely
will get themselves eaten by a guild necromancer before going - that's the
major source of these reagents. In other words, this res blows. A
necromancer cannot in general restore XP to the population base, but rather
can only shift it from person to person.

    Looks like a sarnak's skull on a staff, with obligatory sparklies around
it. From some angles it is a duck, but I've found it isn't as bad as its
press.
