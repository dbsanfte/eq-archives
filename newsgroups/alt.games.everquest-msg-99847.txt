The weekend session was a pretty good one - another 2 lessons well learned
and again no rezzing to drive home the point. First lesson was "Don't forget
you have <Lich> up and go for a fresh beer and a piss". Second lesson was
"Don't catch the Nexus port down to Antonica when packet loss is high".
There is a wandering guard around there that doesn't like Necros and even
though he is easy to kill, the same cannot be said when on linkdeath
autopilot...doh.

Anyway - motivation to restore the lost XP was enstilled. Over to Timorous
Deep and was about to boat over to Kunark when I spot a wandering Spiroc
which conned light blue, previously I had no idea they were so high. Over to
their little treehouse and there was one delighted little Necro admiring a
nicely spaced tree full of light and dark blue single pulls, surrounded by
plenty of room for fear kiting. Bliss : )

After a few hours fear kiting became "automatic", so I moved over to the
fragile rogue pet - wow, talk about damage output: 160+ backstabs. Keeping
Lich going full time, and Bond'ing every second mob for HP, he was able to
pull continuosly without break as long as more mobs were availiable. Every
now and again a 50+ druid would pop by to grab spirocs for tri/quad/quin
kiting, so I made sure to leave half the treehouse untouched. A solo mage
set up camp for a while to and I kinda felt sorry for him - he sat on his
butt for 15 minutes after every pull almost - medding I gather. The necro
was easily getting in 6 or more kills to his every one, there were plenty
more mobs availiable too, so it wasn't hogging either.

Only once did my kite crash with one of the quadding druids, but I suspect
he was just a twerp trying to clear the entire area for himself as he
dragged his little posse twice over the top of the mage right afterwards
(but they didn't aggro). My rogue pet got wiped out in a blink but I feigned
and they all continued on their merry way. I then went into pulling
overdrive and when he came back 20 minutes later for his next batch there
was not a single spiroc to be seen. I didn't see him again but the next 50+
druid to arrive and everyone else co-existed very well.

After 8 hours total I was back to about a kill or two below dinging 55 and
glad to be going in the right direction again. Ended up switching to 100% AA
exp though to keep myself at 54. Without the Augmentation of Death spell
scribed yet, there was no reason to ding 55 and lessen the xp from such a
useful spot, till I find an equally good replacement area anyway. Got
halfway through my first AA point on sunday - all in all a very good weekend
considering there was major packet loss all weekend (my ISP).

So, the chimp has found the safety catch now, all that's left is to figure
out which is the "Ouchies" end before discovering the trigger : )
