Yeah, I rethought it, and upon reconsideration I think its better off
that Stonebrunt stay under populated. More kills for me. My gnome mage
has taken a vow to only hunt in Odus.  Been there since lvl 4 or so,
lvl 31 now, think can squeeze at least 10 more levels out of it,
pandas are still red.

I don't think the advanced zones are for everyone, or for anyone
according to you guys. They need someplace like orc alley or ill omen.
The path most traveled.  Let em level fast. And why? Oh so they can
get to mid 50s and start a twink and take them thru the same zones
again.  Lets keep it that way. 

Maybe I've been at this too long and got bitter.  I've got a 51
cleric, 52 enchanter, 45 druid etc. and I know how silly and jerky
karnors/sebilis is. I know all about bad groups in Ill Omen. How
ridiculouly easy Overthere is. I've gotten Ally with dragons in
Skyshrine. Killed Vox back in the pre-kunark days, helped obtain
epics, all that good crap. 

Oh well, the next free zone is going to be off of Surefall Glades, the
Unkempt Forest.  Still miles away from a gate spot, go figure.

Anyways me and Jabantik will hang out in Stonedblunt, maybe I'll
retire there.  Sad and alone.
