Actually I prefer styrofoam cups or any of the other drink holders that are
well insulated so that your drink does not become watered down. My favorite
being a set of plastic double cups with a vacuum betwen the inner and outer
cup.

For ice it depends on whether the ice is supposed to be `part` of the drink
or not.  If so shaved if not cracked large chunks.
