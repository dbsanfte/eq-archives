It is a simple matter to pair up with an EB caster, or get EB potions, or bage summoned
waterstones, in order to be able to work underwater or in an airless zone for a while.  Hunting
in the grey long enough to get three shissar organs is the work of one day at best, and more
than likely you already know someone who has two of the organs for MQ, so you only need one.  In
fact, if you don't have any source of EB, a friend can just go in, kill shissar till one drops,
and you can run in, loot it, and gate out on one breath, its not as though airlessness is
instant death.

Hadden is a huge time sink in a green zone, and his earring is an unlikely drop when he does
show up.  Once upon a time, it was one of the few EB items out there, and well worth pursuing.
With the ease with which various EB items now drop (Lodi, at least two in SG, drop in the Grey,
quest in the grey...and those are the easy ones that come to mind) he's no more than a footnote,
as far as I'm concerned.
