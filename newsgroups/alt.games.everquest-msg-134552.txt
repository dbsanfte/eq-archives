Yeah, it was lighthearted, but from the way I see it, broadband users are
the ones clogging things up :)  If you look at it from the standpoint of
Verant, and how much bandwith *they* have, they can support MANY times more
simultaneous 56K users than they can broadband users.  In other words, I am
throttled at 56K per second (less, in reality), no matter what I do.  A
cable modem user, on the other hand, could be sucking up 10 times that
amount.  The fact that they get in and out faster doesn't matter, it's the
bytes per second availability that limits Verant's bandwidth.

And yes, I *am* just bitter.  I had a cable modem over *5 years* ago, then
moved to Michigan, where they still don't offer it where I live (nor DSL),
despite the fact that AT&T's website tells me cable modems are available at
my address.  Gah.  LIES!  ALL LIES!

I did just finally get through to the patch server though :)
