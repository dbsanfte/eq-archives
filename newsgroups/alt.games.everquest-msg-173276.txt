A lot of people know about it, but few can take advantage of it.  See, the
Soulbinder will quickly con green to you, and then you won't be able to get
your skill-ups off of him/her/it.

When the Soulbinders were first introduced, they conned red to most folks -
and they wouldn't attack back if you attacked them.  This became a way to
max up your skills - equip a weapon, hit auto-attack, and walk away for an
hour or two.  Come back and find that your skill is now maxed.  When Verant
got wind of this, they brought down all the zones with Soulbinders in them
and retuned them to con green to most people.

So yes, it's an exploit, but not much of one.  You'd be better off getting
your skill-ups by nuking mobs that give you XP.
