Agreed with most of what you have said - Ringo pretty much said it.
Its not the game he has a problem with, its SOE he has a problem with.
It always amazes me how many people gripe about expansions costing
money and that its "milking" the public. They want it all for free.
Well gee, it costs a certain amount of money to develop this stuff. To
expect SOE to eat the cost is rediculous.

If Ringo didnt want to pay for the extras, he DIDNT HAVE TO buy em. As
a consumer, you have the ultimate choice to buy them or NOT to buy
them. If they didnt work on expansions, then hed be bitching about the
game becoming stale. SOE IS A FREAKING BUSINESS!! They are here to
MAKE MONEY!! Arrgghhh. Why is that such an offensive concept to many?
The only thing I find somewhat annoying is the GM spam and ads at
login, but its not that big of a deal. Now.. if product sponsor ads
start popping up in game... Im outta there.

But the other "points" Ringo brings up about EQ are not limited to EQ.
Youll find them in every other online persistant game. Nerfing... time
sinks... every game has got them to one degree or another.
