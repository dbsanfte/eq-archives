Hm, you obviously have been blessed with a talent for aggro management.
I've experienced quite a few differences between soloing my enchanter
and grouping. When soloing I didn't give a damn about aggro. I would
pull with tash, sick my pet(charmed pet, animation is a different story)
on the mob, slow and root the mob as soon as my casting would allow.
In the rare cases when the pet did not get aggro instantly I would
circle my pet till it landed a few more hits. Then root the mob and I'm
done.
If I do this in a group I would soon face a very angry warrior. Imagine
a mob I tash and slow on incoming and run in circles around the warrior
till he finally get's aggro.
And don't tell me to stand in front of the mob and take a few smacks.
This was valid before PoP mobs. But even with the 61 self rune a pop mob
don't need that much time to eat it's way through.

Aggro management is - as stated by 42 - the art of moving up on the hate
list but not that high that the tank loses aggro. And nobody learns that
by soloing. Be it with a pet or even without one.
Try a grouping warrior or a chanter. The former trying to gain aggro as
fast as possible the latter trying to not gain aggro but having to cast
essential high aggro spells as soon as possible.
Since you've played a chanter you should know of the damn high aggro an
tash/slow/mezz. And don't compare the malo line with tash. I was very
annoyed when I learned that Magicians/Shaman and even Bards can malo/oos
on incoming and an arrow from your warrior is all he needs to overcome
the aggro from the debuff.
So for casters good aggro management is good judgement when to cast
which spell imho. And to repeat myself I don't think you learn that
solo.

Maybe your opinion wasn't that convincing? You seem to hold "the
newsgroup" to higher standards than yourself.
