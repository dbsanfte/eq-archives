How about this...

Buy a new copy of EQ ($10.00), register and send the info. See what he does
with the account.  If he's legit, great!  If not, you don't lose any
hard-earned gear/loot.  If he's not legit, just recover the password (you
are the original owner with all the correct information, right?) and recover
the account.  What's to lose?  $10.00?  Hmmm...
