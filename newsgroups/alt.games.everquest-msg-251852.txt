Do the guards drop anything?  I'm not thinking of this as a particularly 
great way to exp, not unless I can get my kill rate up; its not bad, but 
what I like is the combination of drops and exp, and the fact that the 
place is convenient to LFG in or to play shorter durations in.

Nope, don't have it.  Worse, I was recently complaining about the lack 
of a single target one; that I think its generally a waste to DS the 
whole group... and nobody contradicted me.  I'll certainly look for 
this, could be the edge I need to take out the pair.

I didn't observe my pet switching to the lower HP, in fact it seemed to 
me that he was illogically switching to the one with high HP.  I mean, 
he starts in on a mob, I nuke it, the other one has taken damage only 
thru slapping my pet's DS... and yet he ends up switching targets.  I 
surmised he was picking target based on hate.

If the pet picks on whichever has the lowest HP, then I'd be pretty 
happy; it would be a simple matter of nuking fast enough to get one mob 
killed before the pair of them manage to kill my pet.  But if my Hate 
theory is correct, then the fact that he's an air pet, stunning his 
target, means that the other mob, which is hitting him more (due to not 
being stunned half the time), generates more hate and he switches to it. 
  Then when he beats on that one for a bit, the situation reverses and 
he switches back.

Consider what would happen if two warrior PCs (the PL'd kind who never 
hit a taunt button in their lives) in identicle equipment were to attack 
an air elemental mob.  You'd see it exhibit the same behavior wouldn't you?

Now you do say "a much lower health target", which is also mob behavior, 
when someone on the hate list goes to very low HP they do switch to it 
and won't come off till the PC is healed or dies.  SO if I can nuke fast 
enough to get the mob almost dead my pet will finish it off... but that 
wasn't my problem.  Heck, if I could nuke that fast, I could toss one 
more nuke in and kill the mob myself, and not care what my pet was doing!

Second objection; I found that when I tried burning a mob down, I ended 
up getting its attention fairly quickly.  Nuke slowly enough not to get 
aggro, don't heal at all... seems to me I'm going to lose the pet before 
I get one of the two dead.  This may, however, simply be a matter of 
timing, nuking a bit more slowly, but sufficient to get the job done.

I was mainly healing and adding nukes to speed up the kills; I can try 
leaning the other way, mainly nuking and throwing in a heal or two to 
help keep pet alive while waiting between nukes to keep the hate low.

Perhaps I'm weak on the "rules".  Leave pet taunt on, gear up pet with 
proccing weapons and dex belt, heck, pick the air pet cause his stuns 
also generate hate.  Sit on mount so you never sit down.  Nuke, pause, 
nuke.  Stay as far back from the fight as you can.  What more is there 
to it?  Admittedly, I wasn't doing a great job of the "stay back as far 
as you can" part, as that hall is fairly short and I need LOS in order 
to nuke.

I'm concerned that the rains will hit one who hasn't been beat on 
overmuch  by my pet, and it will decide to hate me.  Course I suppose 
once the pet has switched back and forth a few times (stupid git) he'll 
have them both taunted up to where a few 800 point waves won't bother 
them anymore.

I tried Sun Storm out a bit in a group, and found that I was getting an 
awful lot of resists on it; the theoretical damage to mana ratio was 
good but in reality it tended to bite.  Course that was single target, 
on two it should still be better damage per mana than my bolt.

Definately things to think about.
