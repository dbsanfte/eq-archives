The pet's proc rate, highest possible damage (and
ATK rating, and ac will all go up slightly.

Here's where the fun is: debuffs are important in two areas
(when fighting NPCs...when dualing, it's all important), drawing
aggro and lowering a mob's ability to resist certain spells.

Drawing aggro is important for something like waiting on the
main tank in a raid to get enough hate built up before casting
debuff spells, which are major taunts.  Lowering a mob's resists
also taunt, but some critters just can't be hit by some spells until
you lower their magic/poison/cold/etc resists.
