Can't argue with that.

This is one of my biggest peeves about pick-up groups. It's hard to avoid 
the feeling sometimes that it's become merely an endurance contest, where 
the few who manage to stay the longest end up getting to split all the 
loot. It would help if it became standard protocol to split before anyone 
left or joined the group.

/agree

If people want to do nothing but LDoN's, then that's their choice. 
Personally, I love the ability to do one when I have some time to kill. 
They are true dungeon crawls, which I much prefer to static camps.
