Each character saves their UI preference individually.  No worries about
your wife logging on and being confused by yours.

Depends.  I've done two custom UIs.  One is my ultra-minimalist,
ultra-compact raiding UI.  That gives zero "lag" to anyone that has tried
it, and most people find it to be speedier than the default skin.  My second
one, however, is a photoshopped chrome monstrosity that drags my
near-supercomputer down to about 3 frames per second.  But boy is it pretty.

Check the UI sites.  I never did find a specific one that suited me, but I
ripped off bits and pieces of all sorts of mods for the one I use
personally.
