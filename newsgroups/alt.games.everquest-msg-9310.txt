Yes they did.

The big difference is that the hotkeys are stored client-side, and thus have
no impact on the server performance.

To add a 12-slot container means increasing the storage space for each
character on each server by an additional 32 splots.  Depending on how they
implemented it, this could be a very big deal, involving a change to the
master character file.
