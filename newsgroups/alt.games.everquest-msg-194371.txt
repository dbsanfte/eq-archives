The 8x card will work just fine in your 4x AGP slot, and there will be no
difference in speed (well, nothing you or any human eye will notice).  The
whole 8x agp thingy is more marketing hype than anything else.

If you ran bench marks with the exact system at 4x AGP and 8x AGP I'd be
very surprised if the 8x card was any more than 2% quicker.

The card will be just fine and a HUGE improvement over your existing card.
