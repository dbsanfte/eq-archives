Its very easy if you go in invis, right up to his throne, to only get
him and maybe a couple adds. My druid has soloed him from about 49 -
55, often with no trouble. My strategy is this:

Go up there invis (duh)
wait until most of the other sarnaks wander off the platform
root his doggie
Ensnare him
run back and forth on the platform against the wall, near his throne,
nuking him and ignoring the dog hitting me sometimes, loot the prod,
gate.

Basically get him snared and someone keeping the dog busy or root it.
He hits like a tank and can beat someone down fast. The best bet is
not to get hit by him at all unless you have a good tank and someone
to heal it. If you have someone to snare and nuke its actually better
for them to move around on the platform nuking him while the melee
types just concentrate on the dog and any of the lowbie adds. The guy
drops pretty fast with a few nukes and when he is ensnared and intent
on hitting someone with melee, he hardly casts at all (DON'T ROOT HIM
or you negate that)
