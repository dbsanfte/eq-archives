You don't "have" to start a trade skill. You will never get rich from
tradeskills in EQ. In fact you will find yourself spending
hundreds-to-thousands of plat getting a skill high enough to make the
really cool stuff. If you want to start one for fun, go for it.
Tradeskills can be tons of fun, and a great way to meet other people.

As a Ranger you best suited for the following:
Fletching (so you can make your own arrows and bows)
*Brewing (a lot of recipes require foraged items)
*Baking (a lot of recipes require foraged items

You can also do Smithing, Tailoring, Jewel Craft or Pottery, but you
will find that some of your ingredients will require help from other
classes (eq an Enchanter is needed to make magic jewelry)

*Brewing and Baking are the cheapest skills to raise to master level

Play what you want, where you want. Someday you may take your Ranger
to Kunark, or your Iksar to the old world. By playing both now, you
will learn the areas. You can find great maps and info for almost all
of the EQ zones at www.eqatlas.com
