First off, go to www.eqtraders.com for answers to most of your tradeskill
questions, including Alchemy.

As to the answer, there are three gate potions that shaman can make, Field
of Bones, Everfrost, Innothule.  All of them are trivial at 170 alchemy.
Alchemy skill is level limited to 5 points per level over 25.  So, at 58,
the maximum alchemy skill a shaman can have is 170, which means probably an
80% or so success rate on making the potions.  It costs about 170pp per
attempt at a single dose of the potion.  So, cost of materials alone on a 10
dose potion at 80% success would be around 2kpp.  Now add in some profit for
the shaman...  I do see some of them for sale in the bazaar off and on, they
are called Frost, Bone, Swamp.  I seem to recall hearing that a Shar Vahl
gate potion had been discovered, but, am unable to locate any information on
it at the moment.
