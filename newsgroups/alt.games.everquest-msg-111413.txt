I see Playersauction as a perfectly legit method for obtaining gear.
Many of us do not have the time needed to obtain many of these items.
Also many of us are not in uber guilds whp raid all the time and get
items no problem. I have been playing EQ for over 2 years and have a
char in the end 50's but still cannot hold a candle to mid 50 players
in uber guilds. Also my time is worth more out of eq. The money i
could earn at work for working a 8 hour shift could play for 2
Fungi's. It makes sense for me to work than play EQ and hope i win a
roll on a decent drop.

Let the uber guild fools get me my items!
