I have characters named Lokari on the servers upon which I play, but
they're there solely to keep others from using the name and claiming
to be me. I do not play them.

As for that, the name Lokari is one I have used for at least a decade
in various forums, and was chosen without any knowledge of or regard
for commercial products.

How long I've used the name is of course irrelevant to the rules.
Should a player ever petition my name (unlikely since I don't play the
Lokari characters), and a GM actually agree that a brand of rowboat
from Finland constituted a name rules violation and force me to change
my name, I'd accept that.

Oh, and by the way, you might want to do some research into laws
regarding the claims you make *before* you make them. Product names
cannot be copyrighted - they can only be trademarked. Assuming you're
actually referring to the Finnish rowboat products, nowhere on their
pages do I see an indication that they actually have trademarked the
name.

To sum up, you're really, really reaching.
