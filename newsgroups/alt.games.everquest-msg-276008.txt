VS has a very large lifetap proc (I think it's a proc), 1500ish as I 
recall.  Don't recall his resists off hand.  The insane regen was 
probably the lifetap rather than a regen per se.  Are you sure your 
brother duoed VS, and not VSR?  You usually need lots of DPS to overcome 
his lifetap heals as I vaguely recall from doing VS a very long time ago.

No clue, I just float across the stairs that are not really there, and 
head straight to that wing, no key required.

Have not done an LDoN in a very long time now.

There are always rumors about various things after any patch, so, unless 
someone actually has experienced a problem, I would discount such rumors.

Unlikely it's a server specific issue, if there is an issue.
