I've noticed a tendency for my everquest files to crosslink even though I 
defrag my hard drive on a reasonably regular basis.  Have you tried running 
chkdsk with the fix errors and recover sectors options turned on (don't 
know how this works in XP, in 2000 it sets-up to run this when you first 
log on the computer and takes forever)?  It's helped my a couple of times, 
once when my map file for the plane of knowledge was corrupted.  That kept 
me from logging on a character I had on the plane at that time.
