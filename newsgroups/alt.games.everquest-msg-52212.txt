In Highpass you would do OK, so long as you're nothing like the Pally I
ran into there once. No clerics, so our group snatched up two Paladins.
The first time someone needed a heal...

Until about 15 tries later it finally took. And then the poor guy was
out of mana. About 20 attempts to hit someone with light healing. *sigh*
Turns out the dweeb had been power leveled from 1 straight to 19 and
twinked like mad. Couldn't hit anything, couldn't cast a spell to save
anyone's life. Our leader booted him after the second pull.
