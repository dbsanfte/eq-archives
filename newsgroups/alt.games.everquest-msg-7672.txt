And a much greater reason for someone to purchase several to carry.

Honestly I think overall demand will be higher.   There was no way I was going
to shell out that much money for 2 extra bank slots per pack... but a 10%
weight reduction might be worthwhile.  In the worst case scenario, demand will
most likely stay the same.

So, in short, Tailoring was only mildly improved instead of being drasticly
improved.   Cry me a river.
