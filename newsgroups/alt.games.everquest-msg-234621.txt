I'm with you Tim. I don't see a "copyright" issue either. 

As far as a copyright argument goes... it just doesn't make sense.
Plat isn't protected by copyright. It meets none of the criteria
required by copyright law.

Plat is not an artistic work. Plat doesn't represent an artistic work.
Plat is used in an artistic work. But so is the word "the"... that
doesn't afford "the" any special protections. Plat is simply a
counter. The act of "selling plat" is simply offering to perform a few
keystrokes on my end that reduce my counter and increase yours. It
isn't like a bank transaction... bank account numbers represent real
"dollars"... plat doesn't represent anything, its *just* a counter.

Now the EULA argument that you aren't allowed to sell items falls into
a grey area.

You are allowed to sell virtual property for other virtual property.
You are allowed to sell virtual property for virtual services. Both
virtual services and virtual property are implicitly tied to real
services/labor... my buff line in the virtual world is equivalent to
me pressing Alt-1 thru 8 in the real one, 6 hours of PLing is 6 hours
of real labor. I can purchase both services within the framework of
the game.

Its implicit to the game premise and that players are allowed to
exchange virtual assets for other virtual assets. And since virtual
assets are inextricably tied to real labor, the legal challenge is to
argue that an EULA can dictate what real world currency is used. 

Can an EULA legally state I'm allowed to buy your time with plat, but
not your money? You see, the EULA isn't saying you can't buy real
world assets with virtual assets its specifiying *which* real world
assets you are allowed to buy. That sounds like legal suicide to me :)

SOE can declare that its against the rules of them game, and ban
anyone that they perceive has violated them. That skirts the legal
issue entirely, and is equally effective. (More effective, because
there really isn't any legal retaliation to being booted from a game
for cheating. And most important the 'rules' of a game, beyond things
like racial discrimination and sexual harrasment etc are not subject
to legal scrutiny. 

If they  want to make it a bannable violation of the rules to enter
the Bazaar after 2pm PST they can...
