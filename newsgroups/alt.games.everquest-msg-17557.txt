terror forged mask:

Talk to Miadera Shadowfyre and she will tell you that she seeks a fellow
apostle of Cazic Thule to assist her in the [summoning of terror]. Ask her
what summoning of terror and she will say that it will be a frightfully
fulfilling summons. To do this, she needs

1) an eye of urd (from Guk),

2) some basalt drake scales (Rathe Mts),

3) the lens of Lord Soptyver (located in Beholder), and

4) a lock of widowmistress hair (located in Najena).

For you efforts, you will get a Terror Forged Mask
