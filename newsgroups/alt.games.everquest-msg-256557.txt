The following is from the point of view of advise to an enchanter.
hotkey 1: %t is unmezz/stun/etcable, I'm trying to root - save my ass!
Which is why I always have a nice fast casting root memmed... but I 
digress. Communication is essential for an Enchanter, such as:

> Roadrunner mobs are hard to mez, can you kill them first?"
Know your enemy. Mention what you are having problems with as the puller 
goes out. Tell the group what to go after first, while you lockdown 
others. If you see something incoming the you the enchanter knows is 
going to bounce everything you can throw at it, yell before it gets 
there. Make sure the puller knows that his priority is to attempt to not 
get two unmezzables at once.

I know when my mezzes run out. I know what tends to be harder to mez. I 
know what's slowed and debuffed (even if the shaman did it). I WILL be 
telling people what to kill next. Even when there's only one more 
target, because it's a hard habit to break. If there's a no damage 
snarer in the group I also ask them to snare it (in the prelims). I have 
a hotkey for 'assist me for next target' (the only time someone should 
assist me most times. If you don't know the others, please don't assist 
on me). Note to tanking rangers: Best mez break is snare followed by 
damage-root. pisses em off.
note to pallys: stun-whack

true dat. If he ain't squakin he ain't doing about 20% of his job. you 
take up the slack. And appear to do it well... I'm not critisizing you.

If we've got casters to slap around I'll be hanging next to the caster 
while the fight is going on, tracking my mezzes and color stunning the 
caster when he casts if I don't have to remez right that instant. I have 
Extended range, I can easily mez from over here.

The bard trick would be good too though (never run into a bard willing 
to do that, actually.) Do bards have a stun? I don't think they do, do 
they? Hmm al's says they have one at 55...  oh wait.. 5min recast. nm.

Anyway, far be it from me to tell someone how to play their class...
