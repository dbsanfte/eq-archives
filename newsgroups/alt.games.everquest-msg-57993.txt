No one knows his level--guesstimates are level 99.
As for his damage, it's higher than that.  He only "hits" for 1950
max, however it's quad 1950 with chain flurry.  Meaning it's usually 8
x 1950 per combat round.

He also has reportedly over 2 billion hits points (max allowed given a
signed 32-bit integer) and regens faster than Tunare.  He doesn't
death touch the whole zone, he has zone wide aggro will death touch
one person in that zone every 30 seconds.

You would crash the zone before you put a dent in Kerafyrm's health.
