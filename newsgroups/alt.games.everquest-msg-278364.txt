Glancing over the site, I see they're srving up using EQemu. This
should answer both your questions:

1) IANAL, but I believe technically Sony could come down on their
asses, just as they could any other EQemu site.  That said, it may not
be in Sony's best interest to currently pay them any mind; I can't
imagine Sony NOT being aware of this open-source project.  Also,
playing on this, or any other EQemu server is a violation of your EULA.

2) EQemu is a nifty collaborative project to emulate the EQlive serers.
 This was achieved by blatantly ignoring the EULA, and quite possibly
breaking copyright and reverse-engineering laws in many areas. Again,
IANAL, and am not familiar with the projects contributors or
co-ordinators, but it is defenitely a Grey project at best.
Specifically, they sniffed a lot of EQ traffic.

Xiphos - Personally, I'd rather develop a game from the ground up to
maintain both creative and legal integrity and legitemacy. But hey,
that's just me.
