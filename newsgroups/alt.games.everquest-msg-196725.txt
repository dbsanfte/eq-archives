I have managed to have 5 song effects going (briefly) using
Amplification but I'm not able to consistently keep that.  On
occasions (depends on lag) I can get 4 songs twisted with consistency,
and if I throw in the Amplification song (which lasts 30 seconds) that
is my 5th song.  A song will always drop for me if I attempt to
reapply Amplification after the 30 seconds is up.

Last night I was grouped with a Shaman and I was twisting..
Amplification
Chorus of Clarity
Chords of Dissonance
Fufil's Curtailing Chant
Tuyen's Chant of Flame

On occasions during our fights, if you include Amplification, I had 5
songs up even though it was only for a few seconds.
