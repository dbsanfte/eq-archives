On a similar theme I had at one time a handwritten list of items
people would commonly sell in the bazaar for less than a friendly
vendor would give you.  I once bought 80 assorted items inside twenty

Not exactly enough to worry Yantis but respectable considering a level
1 character could do it with perhaps 10 plat to start off with.
