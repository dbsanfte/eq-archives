Wow.  How things change.  I haven't looked at any kind of usenet headers in
15 years.  I remember when I first got on the internet, back in the late
80s, and using character based news readers.  I don't remember the news
reader but ELM was the mail reader.  Every message had full headers, whether
you wanted them or not.  And the internet was uphill both ways. heh  I
wonder if UUCP is still used?  Seems like scalability might be an issue.

Anyway, thanks for the info.
