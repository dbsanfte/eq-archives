I let the first one go, not knowing the lot I would run into later.  I am
generally a giving individual.  The first one I popped in and within 5 min
it popped.  I should have just took it, but I gave it up.  Figured I'd take
the next one... no big deal...

Then I have the run in with this rude little dwarf...

Perhaps, I have only encouraged a new problem with Asradin, but at least he
SEEMED to be appreciative.  I would like to think in someway he could return
the favor of kindness and latitude I gave him be letting him have the kill.
Thornbark on the other hand started off with ignorant childish attitude.  I
am sure, for all my patience, he learned nothing and will continue to be a
jerk.  Hope he gets bored and goes on to some other game.
