It is annoying, made worse by the lag in the graphics engine.  I can be
meleeing a mob and get the message that I cannot see it when it is still
right in front of me.  This is my cue that the cleric has hit it with a
knockback stun and it is really somewhere behind me.  Please use your lowest
level stuns first.  As long as they are able to land at all they will not
land any less due to resists, trust me.
