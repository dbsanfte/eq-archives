Hiya thailor! <wink>

5 reasons why it's like this:

1. Group oriented - You are forced to work with others to make it through
the higher lvl's (unless you're a Necro)
2. More social - You spend countless hours doing next to nothing
(medding...building trade skills) which gives you the opportunity to chat
more.
3. Large female player base (heehee...large female is right) - Due to the
fact that this game also caters to women, you find men being more polite in
hopes they'll meet that special someone online (puke) that "really is a
supermodel"
4. You can't really talk trash to someone and then kill them...then stand
over them and taunt them about it. Talking trash to NPC's gets boring after
awhile.
5. Any game where you can marry someone in game is bound to make you soft
and weak.

You're better off being gay...HA HA HA!!!
