Also shadowhaven and the bazaar, kael, and iceclad (well u can bind, sell
and buy food there anyway), and (of course) neriak, tho Im not sure that all
parts of neriak are ok. Maybe just stay in the foreign quarter.

There are also various vendors around that dont mind ogres. All the druid
vendors are ok (if theres no druids around). Gypsies in sro will probably
sell to you. Centaurs (and maybe krak windchaser) in SK.
