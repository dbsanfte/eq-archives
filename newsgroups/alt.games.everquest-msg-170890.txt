How about literally?  I think I mentioned this in serverwide.age when it 
happened - I saw a GM in the Freeport newb area the other day (did a 
/who).  About ten minutes later I saw him /saying stuff like "Okay, now 
kill this thing.  Now come here and I'll show you how to sell stuff."  I 
kinda gaped and did another /who on him - couldn't tell he was a GM 
anymore.  I dunno if it was a day off for him and he was helping out a 
friend, or if this is why I had to wait three days to get my last name 
on Taellaar.  ;)
