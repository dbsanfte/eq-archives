	You are indeed underleveled.  This quest eventually requires you to kill
level 35 or so mobs.  This is the new quest for Ghoulbane, the first of the
Paladin holy swords.  No longer must Paladins go out and assassinate another
Paladin for their first flaming blade.

	Ghoulbane is not NoTwink, but I don't know if a non-Paladin can complete
the quest -- if he can, he shouldn't be able to IMO.
