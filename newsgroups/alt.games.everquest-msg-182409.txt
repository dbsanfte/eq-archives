The problem with C is that when you allow one player's victory (or loss) to
substantially alter the game dynamic, the next player to come along may want
that same challenge (they are paying for) and it's no longer there.  With D,
the game can fluctuate over time, and the players have to time their actions
to the game's flow.  From a programming standpoint, either is doable, but D
is more marketable.  D already happens in a limited way, with guards killing
monsters that get too close, that proprosal is merely an expansion of the
theme.  It would make things interesting.  You're going to the inn to sleep
off your wounds and restock your food supply... You enter the inn and come
under attack.  It certainly adds a new dynamic to the game.
