Not that it matters any more, but I used to do that a lot when selling
really low end stuff. Expensive stuff I'd have some idea of what I
wanted for it and name a price but on lowbie items I just didn't care.
If I thought it was worth 100p and someone offered me 40 for it, I'd
probably take it. If someone offered me 20p, two stacks of bone chips
and a piece of banded armor then I'd probably just give it to him.
Anyone scrounging that hard for an upgrade deserves an occasional
break imo.

Seeing a 'not necessary' will always get me to add a tip if I happened
to be buying buffs with an alt.

I don't really see the mana cost as important. I'm paying for the time
of the person sitting in the nexus selling KEI, how much it costs to
cast is irrelevant. Kinda like the old paying for ports, I wasn't
paying for the time and mana it took to port as much as I was paying
for the time of someone actually jumping to different zones hoping to
make a buck from porting people.
