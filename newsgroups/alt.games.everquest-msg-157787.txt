Because the animation sucks in first person view, and the sound
sucks period.  But I've learned to ignore the irritation of the
former because my Paladin needs any ATK buff he can get, and my
Druid is, well, a Druid.  As for the latter, I usually play with
sound off these days, so that's become moot.

I'm sure all the "evils" out there are shedding great tears for
you over that.

I'll agree that it's special.

I could have spent some time inventing a more pleasant way to say

You seem to have this uncontrollable urge to use absurd analogies
in place of reasoned argument.  Which supports my assessment of
your capacity for imaginative thought.  You should try to learn a
new trick, it won't actually hurt you, promise.

More bullshit.  There are a number of very useful Druid ports that
remain so, and more than one of those that are no longer as useful
will still save a group travel time.  Besides that your evac ports
are unaffected.  And porting is just a small piece of your power.

I disagree.  In fact, if I didn't have so many friends who play Druids,
your whining would be enough for me to start a call for a major Druid
nerf to compensate for the IncompleteHeal (whatever it's called) they
just gave you, gimping Harmony wasn't enough, whiners like you deserve
to have something real to whine about.

Are you totally clueless???  Druids are hugely group friendly.

ROFL.  I take this as an assertion that you believe ridiculous
analogies form the basis of intelligent argument.

Um, I hate to break it to you, but you are posting here very much
"in the manner of a fuckwit".

You have presented your "concerns" in the form of an irrational
whine, why would I refer to them in any other fashion?

No, it naturally follows from your whine.

Once again, it's not your defining ability, and it's not been
rendered useless.

I'm waiting for you to express an idea other than "waaah!  they gave

It certainly would be, it's a good thing that didn't happen.

Are you serious?  Let's take just a moment to consider the absurdity
you put forth above about "doctor cut off their leg unnecessarily"
and "they couldn't play pro basketball anymore", shall we?  Tell me
now, what part of your Druid was cut off?  really, what was removed?
where is the damage you have suffered that is analogous to the loss
of a leg?  well?  for that matter, what damage have you suffered at
all?  well?  damn, that's a real shame, no damage at all, kinda makes
the total absence of anything even remotely analogous to not being
able to "play pro basketball anymore" pretty fucking moot, doesn't
it?  Hmmm, perhaps I've misjudged you, this last post makes it seem
possible that you're really a masochist fishing for abuse.
