Some kills still let me see some exp movement on the blue bar. I
completed a quest last night that gave me two and a half blue bubbles
of 57 :p and it's not that hard to get at least one blue bubble of exp
a night - you just don't see instant gratification.
Anyway, until Velious all we had was the yellow bar. And, at 51... you
ain't seen nuthin' yet.
