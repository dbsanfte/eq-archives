what gets me mad is people that leave groups when kei goes out because 
they think it's a must. Fellow shaman and necro's being the 2 that gets 
me mad the most! Think about it, a shaman can cann dance from level 24 
up, that with regen makes for a pretty effective mana regen. However... 
there is young shaman out there i have talked to that didn't even buy 
cann because they have kei cast on them all the time. This does hurt how 
well they can play there class, I do get Kei at times but that is only 
when I am taking part on a raid. I just wish people would open up there 
eyes and see that depending on that one spell is wrong, and leveing a 
group going though 3 or 4 zones and then porting up to the nexus to get 
a kei for the "benifit of the group" is not helping.
