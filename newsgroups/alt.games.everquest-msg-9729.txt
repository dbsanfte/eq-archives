The reason RC has done this and is enjoying Melons' post/findings so much is
obviously down to Biz digging thru dejanews archives to find something on
him, as he did in the past and I believe he may have done when I first
arrived. Kinda deserved, imo, if it is dragging on abit now. I did laugh
when I red an extract of Biz chastising someone for flaming a poster, that
was classic.

Bah, Kill files don't require will power, just not replying requires will
power...actually that hardly requires much either.

I don't really think RC cares anymore, he knows that this makes him look bad
but this is just the sort of thing Biz has done, or threatened to do. I
don't agree with it, predictably. I don't care much for Biz, there is no
love lost between us but I'm not in the least bit interested in who Biz is
IRL...I don't think he's ever claimed to be anything he's not 'cept maybe
smarter than others in one of his frequent flame wars but that line has been
worn out by many people.
I don't share this fascination with trying make Biz look bad,
either...surely those of that opinion do not need it strengthened, every
once in a while Biz does that himself and those that don't are going to side
with him more, like you said, a personal attack like this actually makes him
look cleaner than his attackers.

Oh well, wonder how long this'll run for
