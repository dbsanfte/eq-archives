Don't be silly.  Down time for a warrior soloing consists of binding wounds
till you are up to 50%, then picking your next target to kill.  A warrior is
much more active in down time than most casters, who are merely sitting waiting
for their mana to come back.  At extremely low levels you might have trouble
with cash for bandages, but that goes away soon enough.  And if you can get
enough cash together you can pick up a... darn it, whats the name of that thing
that procs bandages.
