No, the Pass is more like a friendly dungeon than a safe zone. There are
mobs at the Kith and EC entrance just waiting to jump you, and the zone
itself is mazy enough that it's easy to get lost in. And there's also some
guards, merchants, forges and such. The Keep is quite a bit more reasonable.
Bankers, merchants, and guards first, then you can go deeper to get to the
mobs.

Be sure to print out a map or somethine. If your server is anything like
Xev, the Keep has 30+ people in it at all times, and the Pass is deserted.
So you'll rarely find anyone to help with directions.

Oh yeah, happens to everyone. I think the idea was that with Selo's you
can easily stay out of melee range of anything remotely aggressive as long
as you don't run right over the top of them. Even with casters, you can
often be out of spell range before they can get a spell off on you.

If you can get from FP to HHK, you've done the hardest part. The HHK to
Qeynos run is pretty tame, especially if you run along the south shore of
West Karana. But don't forget to get a Bind in HHK while you're there,
just in case.
