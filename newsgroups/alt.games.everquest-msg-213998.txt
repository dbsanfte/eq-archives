I skipped my concluding point, which was that while DOTs can be used to full
efficiency simply by casting only on mobs that will live long enough to get full
effect (including casting a second time, third time, whatever it takes... as long as
you don't cast on a mob that will die before the DOT wears off), the fact that you
want the mob to stay snared means you almost always waste some of the DOT damage,
because you can't just stop casting the darkness.
