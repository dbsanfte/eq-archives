I'll give you one real obvious one.  When you're fighting multiple mobs
and one of them is a CHeal capable healer (ex: Darkpaw Curate in JP).
Its not so much that the healer is likely to get the spell off, assuming
you're working with a capable group/partner, as that the threat of the
spell forces you to focus on eliminating him, you can't just rot him
the way you can a melee add, especially as they are also enthusiastic
nukers and Cleric nukes can work pretty well for mobs due to their high
mana regen.  I've handled multiple pulls including a healer easily while
partnered with a Druid by getting the melees rooted and snared first,
then getting on the healer and asking the Druid to "kill it now please".
Works like a dream.  Druid/Paladin combo kicks, "ghetto" crowd control
(root) has its advantages, you can marinate the tough adds with a DoT or
two to tenderize them a bit while you're taking down the target of the
moment.
