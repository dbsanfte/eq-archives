I'd never played a Warcraft game in my life, but when my month of EQ2 was 
almost up, and I decided it just wasn't quite doing it for me, decided to 
give WoW a try, and I'm glad I did.

Now, I'm more of a soloing type player myself, and WoW is set up toward that 
a *lot* more than EQ2.  But from what I see scanning the various chat 
screens, grouping in WoW seems alive and well, with very little of the 
"dewdism", elitism, etc. that I'd resigned myself to experiencing when I 
started playing.  Now that's not to say it doesn't exist--it surely 
does--but it's just not become more than background noise on the server I 
mostly use, that I've noticed.

I'll just end by saying that toward the end of my EQ2 month, I'd experienced 
a ton of things I'd like to see modified or done away with--and like you, 
there's still much about EQ2 I like. After my WoW month, however, there's 
very little of that--zoning is so inconsequential as to be almost a 
non-issue, the graphics aren't the "latest and bestest", but they look 
great, anyway, and best of all I'm running them completely maxed--smooth as 
silk, and that's something that *never* happened in EQ2, even with me 
lowering most all the options as far as they'd go (in which case, of course, 
you're left with a game that pretty much looks like shit).

There's only one way to find out if you'd like WoW, though.  :-)
