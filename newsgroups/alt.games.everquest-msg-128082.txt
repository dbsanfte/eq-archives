To reset the zone 1 side must win. So, for example, if the Grimlings still
have their camp and the Wolf caves then you need to help them win against
the Owl bears. Once a side has won a named mob (of some sort) will spawn
near the outpost, kill him and reset the sides.

Couple of problems.
To help a side win a battle you need to kill the defenders of their
opponents, these spawn 4 at a time outside the cave entrance (or main hut in
Grimlings case) they are rooted to the spot and can summon, no, their not
50th level but they are tough. Most of the mobs in HollowShade war are
undercons, Grimlings especially.

Next, I have no idea what the named mob(s) that spawns to reset the zone is.
My only idea is it is Dirtchomp or Gorehorn (named hopper and Beetle) these
both spawn in the right area and I have only seen them when one side has won
(this may very well be coincidence) I have also read it is a named of
whatever race has won...can't confirm either of these.

The last problem, you really need a high level to do this for you and,
although you will likely see 2 or 3 in the zone, most of them are farming
and the Grimlings drop the best loot so it's not in their interest to reset
the zone.
