Corpse recovery is one of the most annoying aspects of EQ, for the
following reasons:

1. It discourages pushing your limits, because if you try something
too hard and die, your group then has to do corpse recovery, with your
non-casters hampered by not having access to their best equipment, and
your casters at about 60 percent of their normal mana.  If you
couldn't handle an area with your party at its best, having to try it
with a crippled party is just cruel.

2. It can be very time consuming.  Nothing spoils a day like capping
off a nice four or five hour raid by an hour of corpse recovery.

Of course, you can mitigate the above problems with necros and plat,
if you can afford it.

EQ has compasses, too.  They cost about 3 plat from a vendor.

The "sense heading" skill has always bugged me in EQ, because it makes
no sense for it not to start at 200.  A level 1 EQ character has
clearly already devoted considerable time to training to become an
adventurer (if not, the casters would not all start with spells).
Part of that training would include basic skills such as figuring out
your heading.  Our characters would not start out being less adept
outdoors than a typical Earth Boy Scout!  (Yes, that means everyone
should have foraging, too).
