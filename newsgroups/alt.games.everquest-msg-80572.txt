Yeah, it has the same importance as chr does for charming anything, which is
to say, it's a hotly debated topic. Some people swear that 200 chr makes a
huge difference, some notice no difference at all. I personally notice
little difference with charming either animals (with my druid) or other
stuff (with my chanter) as long as chr is over 120 or so; but your mileage
may vary. If the chr is under 100 though, forget it. You get too many
resists.
