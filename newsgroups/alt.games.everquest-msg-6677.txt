Some nice changes today. Some I've wanted for over a year! Woohoo! Such
as the difficulty looting really large NPCs. My better half stumbled upon 
something called a Terrorantuala in SRO once recently and we could not loot 
the damned thing no matter what we did.
 
 I kinda like the spell changes and additions with the Translocate line
except that now us Wizzies cannot TL ourselves. WTF? What's up with that?
I know I can use gate to do the same thing but suppose the group/raid is 
all over with and people are heading out and I'm doing TLs. So now I gotta
sit down, swap spells and gate myself with a different spell? And what 
about Group Translocate? It's not really a "Group Translocate" is it? It's 
the "Group Translocate except the group member casting it" spell instead. 
Hmmmmm. Welp based on the little tidbit of info "Translocate Group can be 
found on NPCs in Velious (and they won't give them up easily)." it sounds 
like I won't have to worry about that for a while. I think I see another 
20kpp spell in the future in the marketplace in FP.
 
 The addition of the looting text, the ability to move stuff in the bank
and the expanded friends list is very, very nice. I've want those for ages.

 I could care less about the PvP changes...
 
 
 Full patch text below:
 

May 8th, 3:00 am
------------------------------


** PvP changes **

We have made the first of our upcoming changes to the PvP aspects of EverQuest:
 
- Consider:  /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player
Character.  The 
character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him.  The
character
 will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack.  And the character will
show as
 'red' if he is above your range.  This will only take effect on PvP servers.

- Sanctuary Levels:  Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat,
unless they
 take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.  This will, obviously, only take place on
PvP servers.

- De-Leveling:  Characters that lose levels will only retain the combat skills of a
character two 
levels higher.  This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that
character 
will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character.  This change will
apply to 
all servers (it has to, code-wise).  So the two level buffer is there to make certain that
people 
that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected
at all), 
while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief
will find 
themselves at no great advantage.

These are the first of the things that we plan to.  We are taking a careful, step-by-step
approach 
to changes whenever we can, and we have other changes planned for upcoming patches.



** Quest Changes **

-  We've made a change to the Velious armor quests.  The folks in Kael and in Skyshrine that
give 
out rewards for these quests are now being stricter about who they will reward quest items
to.  You 
will have to be considered an 'ally' (see Features section below) by these NPCs in order to
be able 
to complete these quests.  If you are doing quests for the Coldain, however, they are
somewhat less 
picky, and they only require that they consider you 'kindly' to reward you for your labors.

- The Black Silk Cape will now drop more frequently.


** Bug Fixes **

- Attacking with a two-handed piercing weapon will now 'gray-out' the attack button as it
should.

- Text that once read: "You cannot remove this affect." now reads "You cannot remove this
effect."  
Changed by popular demand... :)

- Food Emotes:  Forcing your character to eat by right clicking food will now properly
display the 
appropriate emote to those in the area.

- Fixed a problem that often made it difficult to loot really large NPCs.


** Item Changes **

- The Shield of Tsunami can now be equipped in the secondary slot.

- Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows, the better the quiver the faster your bow.  We
will not 
be listing the speed increase a quiver will give your bow, but you can tell the good quivers
by their 
ability to reduce the weight of your arrows (better-made or magical quivers have this
property).

- The Ivory Handled Falchion should now 'proc' without telling you that it is out of
charges.  You 
may need to contact your GM to replace the item with a new version if it is still acting
strangely.
 
- The Opal Bracelet is now a wrist item, not a finger item.  Be aware, once you remove it
from your 
finger, it will not go back onto that finger, it will only fit on your wrists, as it should.

- The Large Dragonbone Shard will no longer appear to be a Staff of the Gathering.

- The Ring of Levitation will now poof when all the charges are used up, and should display
the 
correct number of charges.

- The Priceless Velium Reinforced Bow now has a range of 200 instead of a range of 0.

- The Refined Mithril Blade should now be equipable in both primary and secondary slots.

- The Unicorn Horn should now have a graphic.

- The Hammer of Flattening has been changed from tiny to large.  This might cause you a
little 
reorganization in your inventory.

- Runebranded Stone Buckler is now labeled as a shield and can be used to bash.

- The Ring of Pureblood is now a finger item, not a waist item.


** Spell Changes and Additions **

- Translocation spells:  Five new Wizard 'push' spells have been added (Translocate: Fay,
Tox, 
North, Combine and Group).  Translocate spells send the group to the location, while the
Wizard 
remains behind.  Translocate Group sends everyone in the group (except the Wizard) to their
own 
bind points.  Translocate Group can be found on NPCs in Velious (and they won't give them up
easily).  The others are available on an exclusive vendor.  All Translocate spells (even the
original Translocate) have confirmation boxes that must be accepted before the target will
be sent.  And Wizards can no longer Translocate themselves.

- Some lower 39th and 44th level Velious spells have had their drop rates increased.

- GM Resurrection has had it's name changed from ResurrectionGM to Customer Service
Resurrection so 
that players will be able to better tell when they are getting a resurrection from the GM
staff. GM 
resurrection will no longer have Res effects, and will leave the newly Ressed with full Hit
Points 
and Mana.

- Divine Aura and spells of that type (Divine Aura - cleric, Divine Barrier - cleric,
Kazumi's Note 
of Preservation - bard, Harmshield - necromancer, Quivering Veil of Xarn - necromancer) will
now 
prevent the caster from being stunned when hit for their duration.

- The Eye of Zomm series of spells will no longer work in Kedge Keep.  This change was made
to 
prevent an exploit.

 
** Feature Additions and Changes **

- Looting text has been changed.  You will now see a -- before and after any loot messages. 
This 
has been changed primarily to help prevent any fake looting messages from being thought of
as real.

- When you loot an item, you will receive a text message telling you what you have just
looted.

- Expanded Friends List:  The Friends List will now hold 30 character names.  And each
character has 
its own friends list.  You can find and edit this list with a text editor, if you need to,
outside 
the game.  You can locate the text files in your EverQuest directory.  The files will look
like 
this:  <character name>_<#>.ini.  The default Friends List for existing and new characters
will be 
your old Friends List.

- The destroy or drop item confirmation box will now close if you accidentally pick up
another item 
while they are open.  This should prevent accidentally deleting or dropping the wrong item.

- When selling to a merchant, you can no longer sell items that are inside a container by
having the 
container selected and clicking the sell button.  The merchant will tell you that you need
to empty 
the container before the merchant will buy it.  This should prevent folks from accidentally
selling 
items that they did not know were in those containers.

- You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank.

- There is a new /consider message: "regards you as an ally".  This is the highest level of 
friendliness that an NPC will register using the /consider command.  The faction required to
reach 
this rating is significantly higher than 'warmly'.
