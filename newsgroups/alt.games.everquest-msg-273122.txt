The first time I went to Nektro, it was the first time all but one in
my group was there.  Thankfully, the experienced one was our tank.  She
led the way and we completed a couple quests (the boars eye that you
alluded).  We were having a blast, and completed some of the first
floor quests.  Unfortunately, the tank had to leave, so the rest of us
followed suit.

The second time I went, it was a pickup group.  I was in EL and got a
tell asking if I wanted to hit the castle.  So I met up with them at
the entrance.  That group we had a defiler (who was in my first Nektro
group), an inquisitor, a necromancer (who was too low level to get any
credit while grouped with us, he just wanted to tour the castle and
hang out), a shadowknight (about the same level as me), a 37 berserker
as the tank, and myself (an assassin - around 34 at the time I
believe).

As we zoned in, the defiler crashed.  When he logged back in, it
wouldn't let him in the castle with us.  We /petitioned to get the
defiler back in with us, but the GMs couldn't help.  We were down to
five, with only one healer and one DPS (the necro was too low to hit a
lot of stuff in there).  It was their third or fourth time in the
castle and had it down to a science.  We completed the quests on the
first floor that I didn't do yet, then went to get the sisters.

We tore through the sisters, although the twins did give us a bit of a
problem.  I know the demon you were referring to well... He is like a
groupx3 level 45^^^ or there about.  We got around him by jumping over
the rail and then bonzai'ing right down into the cellar.

We finally got to the basement and ran into the Juggernaut.  We found
the quest you talked about, grumbled a bit, then went down the hall.
There are some rooms that open up and get all kinds of aggro from as
you pass.  We backed off a bit to regen, and that is when we noticed
the Juggernaut was back up.  He does respawn.

We went down the hallway into the final room.  After talking to
Everling, he attacked our tank.  The only problem was that nobody else
could attack Everling except the person who Everling was attacking.
Since those mobs are definately not soloable, we ended up wiping.

The third time I went back, everything was going good.  I was in a full
group, and two of us kind of lead the rest through all the first level
quests.  After that, it was on to the sisters (oddly enough, my locket
quest reset so I got credit for doing it again).  Everything was going
good until we got to the twins.  Our coercer wasn't paying attention,
went too far down the stairs, and got aggro'd.  He died quickly, and
then the mobs split up to hit everybody else.  There was no way for the
tank to get them all, and since the healers were busy trying to heal
themselves as the tank got beat on from behind they fell quickly.
Myself and the swashbuckler held out a tad longer, but there was really
no hope.  We wiped that time without even seeing Everling.

I am planning on going back Friday - we have a group already planned,
between 35 and 38 (tank might be 40).  As much fun as Nektro is, I am
looking forward to beating Everling and continuing on the Earring
quest.  Of course, as long as I've been trying to get Everling, others
have been trying to get the named in RoV - it sounds like he is a
really rare spawn (hopefully that was fixed).

A couple things work in our favor now.  First, the castle lock out has
been greatly reduced on 19 Jan.  On a 'successful' attempt, you are
locked out for 18 hours.  On a failed attempt, the lockout is only two
hours.  That will let us try a bunch of times over a weekend if we have
time rather than only getting a shot once a week.
Oh, and the refresh on your wife's evac should only be 15mins ;)
