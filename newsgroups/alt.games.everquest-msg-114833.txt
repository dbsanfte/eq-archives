As Richard pointed out, the easiest way is to help whack Sir Lucan, but
that's not an option if you want to save your Freeport Militia faction (but
it's fairly worthless to a Necro since you can just use the Freeport
underground or invis to get around the city).  There is also a bard quest
you can do to raise it; if you go to the Grub and Grog Tavern in East
Freeport you can give Fabian 2 gold to raise faction, so if you have the
cash just get a lot of gold, go down there, and do it repeatedly.  If your
faction is too low to get the quest, have a 39+ druid give you wolf form.

They hate you for a combination of your race, class, and religion.  I know
an agnostic Dark Elf enchanter is not KoS by default to Knights of Truth,
but as a DE necro you don't have much of a choice.
