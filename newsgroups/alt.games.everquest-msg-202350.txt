My apologies, bizbee.  Vitriol was too harsh a word to describe your
response.

What dman says - now *that's* vitriol.  =)

Er, learning how to use exploits is *not* the reason I created a new
character.  I don't think that's the reason the majority of people create
new characters, either.

I don't have a Fungi.  However, with Divine Purpose (a level 39 paladin
spell) and KEI going at the same time, I regen hitpoints as if I was wearing
a fungi tunic - that's all I meant.

And you'd be surprised to find out that Virtue is of very little use.  Yeah,
I have more hitpoints - but they still get eaten away, and it only increases
my downtime trying to heal it all back up.  Virtue's primary use is allowing
me to break a spawn - I can fight three blue mobs at once without fear of
dying.  After the spawn is broken, the only real use I get out of Virtue is
the AC boost.

KEI helps downtime, that's all.  Without it, healing up and recovering after
every battle is painfully slow.  I don't know about you, but I don't think
sitting and waiting to recover health and mana helps me learn how to play my
character any better.

Well, if you hadn't noticed, I'm *not* grouping.  I'm going to solo this guy
all the way up to 65 if I can.  Yes, I'm going to miss out on learning how
to melee in a group.  But I'm still learning a lot about some of the issues
a melee can face.

Again, you haven't told me how having KEI will make it so that I don't learn
how to play my paladin.  KEI shortens my downtime considerably.  I manage my
mana just fine - I actually barely cast during a battle.  Yaulp, of course,
gets cast constantly - at a cost of 1 mana.  I also cast root at the end of
the fight so that the mob won't flee.  All told, I use less than 100 mana
per fight - and I only use that much when root is resisted or breaks.

You'll have to explain to me what lessons I'm failing to learn by having
KEI, 'cuz I don't see it.

I disagree.  I personally know of a few people living in trailer parks
making less than twelve hundred dollars a month who play EQ.  All you need
is a so-so computer, a 56K internet connection, and $15 a month to pay Sony.

> Yeah yeah. Hitler probably said the same thing.

Oops.  You weren't half-bad until you invoked Godwin's Law.  I used an
exploit to get across a zone.  Hitler killed millions of people.  In no way,
shape, or form are the two morally equivalent.  You weren't doing so bad
until you went *way* over the top with this comparison.

Yes, I used an exploit to get through Siren's Grove.  Yes, I used it even
knowing it was an exploit.  Yes, I've stopped using it.  And yes, since then
I have not used any other exploits, nor do I want to - which is why I made
this post in the first place.  Feel free to call me a hypocrite for not
continuing to use exploits - my conscience is clear in that respect.
