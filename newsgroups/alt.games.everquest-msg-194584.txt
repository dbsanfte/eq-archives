I would recommend either a Plate class like Warrior, Shadow Knight or
Paladin.  Or a Monk.  I have a Mage and Warrior and like to switch off
playing the two.  If Groups are not Important then I would pick the Mage.
Before the Mage gained the ability to summon focus items I would have picked
the Necro.  With the Warrior or any other plate class you will not have to
worry about running in circles.  You will be at the center of the fight and
the only running in circles you will have to do is to taunt the mobs off of
the finger wiglers in the group that could not hold back their nukes until
the right time.  I am satisfied playing my Warrior however my Mage makes me
more money by soloing.
