Noclin might have been killed, but those 2 guards don't get killed... I've
seen a couple of lvl 50+ waiting for a Hole raid try to kill them.  It
wasn't happening.  However, as soon as they got out of a certain range, the
guards went back to their spawn points.

All of paineel (except Duriek Bloodpool in the newbie area, just above those
2 guards) is on the same faction - Heretics.  So if the guards wanted to
kill you, the whole city wants to.
