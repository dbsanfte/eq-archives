I have never put any percentages on it, but 50% sounds high, although it
breakes often enough and at bad times, so I am with Dan, considering all
the other tools an enchanter has it is not one of the best.

The defineing skill for an enchanter is mezz, no doubt about it, charm
is a minor tool. I have said this before, but the 34 level mezz last 72
seconds, and except for a greenie I have never had a charm last close to
that. I can have a roomfull of creatures mezzed, I can charm one, and
when charmed i have to be thinking about controlling it, and seriously
an enchanter has quite a bit to think about already.

:> Charming is a sideline...that's all it is. 

: For you, this may be true. Not every tool is right for every job. Just
: because a circular saw makes a poor hammer, does not make the circular
: saw useless, and a "sideline". Same with charm. Just because you are
: afraid of using this ability, does not make it a worthless ability for
: everyone. I use it, and make it pay.

Well I don't think he said useless. In fact I have found it very useful,
in the right situation. It has saved my butt on a few occasions so has
my pet, but I RARELY use either any more.

: Did you move root back there with charm too?

I don't root much any more either, because mezz parks a mob better than
root and since I am always grouped, usually I let others root. That does
not mean I don't root from time to time, depends on the configuration of
the group. The spells I alway keep memed are suffocate, anarchy, color
shift, entrance, and tashani. The others I am constantly swapping
around.

: I disagree. It's incredibly powerful, and a lot of fun.

It is fun, no doubt, but no way to make a living....

: Groups I get in are asking me to charm adds. They see the power. I

You will find, as you get higher in level, people will start asking you
to mezz. In fact, they will be expecting it, and if you start charming
stuff in dungeons people will loose patience with you fast. You do a
good job of mezzing and people will seek you out.

: Actually, charm is really a form of crowd control. I use it that way
: sometimes. Mez line is not defining for chanters, because the effect
: is shared with other classes.

Yup charm is a form of crowd control, but it is a second class form of
crowd control. AND bards can mezzmerize and charm, druids can charm...

: You seem to have a very narrow view of what's acceptable for your
: class. Don't you find that playing the same way all the time to get

I personally don't find this a narrow or limiting, only realistic. I
still charm/fear kite and even get out a pet from time to time. I would
not try to make a living doing it though, there are other classes that
are much better and more fun at it. *cough* necro.

From time to time I kite stuff with my ranger and melee with my druid,
but I would not try to make a living doing either, because it is not
their defining ability.
