Actually, for the record,they aren't in public domain.  Essentially every
post is copyrighted the moment it is posted and you own it.  Unfortunately
people have been making money off of stealing other peoples' work and when
questioned about it they yell out "Public Domain".

For all intents and purposes you own your stories, even if they are posted
in a public forum and have every right to demand that someone not post them
elsewhere.

I also wanted to add, thank you, Lewzephyr.  You'd be surprised how many
people forget to ask your question and from someone who is constantly
fighting sleezebags who insist on making money from my work, it's
appreciated.
