There is a cost of doing buisness with each customer, this opportunity cost
favors few customers rather than many. By limiting his sales to a set amount
below what he would like to sell you have effectively rasied his costs and
thus lowered his profit margin. Also if you would look below you will see
the only one gallon and only for a buck . You restricted his price as well.

1) The gas would sell just fine just the owner would not want to sell it. He
leaves the market, He sells none.

2) your history books are suspect at best but ww2 rationing like all other
rationing and goverment control of prices CAUSED scarcity. Scarcity you know
? Where many people want to buy something but cant since there is not enough
for sale? The reason that the people in the soviet union stood in line 8
hours to buy the 30 cent loaf of bread?

Well lets go to sanijans mentioning of the power crisis in california. Dont
know whether you know it or not but californians use less power per person
then in any other state. They conserve energy better than any of the rest of
us . They had an idiot governor who had a bright idea to restrict the price
of energy to a specific amount. The intent was to keep his people from
getting cheated by the evil greedy power companies. He ran the power
companies out of buisness. Then he had to make deals with outside california
power companies to buy power at a grossly inflated rate. Signing contracts
that mean californians pay more for power than anyone else and better yet
that power is produced in old outdated plants that pollute far more than
normal ones do.

Now the people he killed are harder to find because they hide . Im pretty
sure death certificates dont list idiot governor as the cause of death.
Perhaps they say something like the following.

Charles died due to severe lacerations of the face causing rapid blood loss
and the asociated heart failure. (dosnet mention the car crash was due to a
traffic light that went out)

Miss May died due to complications from a hip fracture several weeks ago
when she fell down the stairs . ( dosent mention that the lights where out
so she couldnt see )

Mr oxford died to heart failure associated with hardening of the arteries.
(dosent mention the all grease breakfest he ate out last week since his
stove wasnt working to make his morning oatmeal, he really enjoyed that
breakfest btw )

etc,etc,etc
