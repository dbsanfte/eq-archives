Warriors have Crafted, SK's have Dark Forge, Paladins have Ro, Shaman
totemic, Clerics, erm, well they have to be different with their pieces all
having different names and Rogues have Ravenscale....have I missed anyone?
Anyway, Druids don't get a quest armour from old world (not sure why that
is)

Full black is, likely,  Gnome skin from ToFS, normally worn for effect, only
the gloves are really any use to a druid.

Sorry, you're stuck in mismatched stuff that looks like leather.
You are at a level now where you can port for plat and make a little money
to buy some better equipment (many old world items will be affordable) but
I'm afraid, except for Elder Spiritualists it all seems to look the same to
me (especially now there are no Velious textures with SoL upgrade)
You may want to look cool in black but you really need the wisdom bonuses of
the boring looking Gatorscale legs and foremans tunics, sorry about that.
Have not seen the Earth Blessed Armour yet (still not got last piece for
tunic) but I am betting it looks like leather.
