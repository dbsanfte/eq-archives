Yes its sick, but its just like Quillmane in SK. Everyone goes for the kill
as soon as he pops.
Spawn time of mobs is perhaps 1 of the most serious problems with EQ. How
can they fix it? How can they make everyone happy? Epics are supposed to be
rare, but these days, everyone has a level 60 character somewhere, and epics
arent that rare anymore. Seems VI are trying to uphold a policy that
contrdicts their own code over time.
However, its nice to know that us lucky ones in huge guilds are gods on
their respective servers :)
