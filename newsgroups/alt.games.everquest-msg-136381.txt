They've Nerfed Gems!?!

That's it! Verant have gone to far this time.

I'm quitting, smiley, get your ass over to Bristlebane you can have..oh hang
on, I never used gems since the first day of it...smiley? Stay where you are
:ï¿½)

Wonder if the guy that wrote gems will write a patch for the new UI...I'm
sure it still works with the old interface, just not the new one (bit like
/camp desktop) did they pull it completely, gems, not /camp desktop, or is
it just disabled with new UI?

We should really have been notified about such a dramatic change and removal
of content from the game. Did they think another zone, friendlier interface
and easier trading facilities make up for removing Gems?

TBH until you posted I had forgotten all about Gems.
