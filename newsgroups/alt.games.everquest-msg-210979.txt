No, they do! I've been playing a Ranger since January and leveled him to 35,
and I'm surprised at how much I suck. Can't take hits worth crap, easily
outdamaged by most other melees, has the casting ability of a level 15
druid, but, oh wait, I HAVE TRACK! Oh, yay, I can track stuff. Yipee.

Why is it every other hybrid has a super-cool innate ability? SKs get
harmtouch and Paladins get lay of hands. Rangers get track. Track sucks.
Well, maybe that's not true, it's helpful, but it's no harmtouch or LOH.
Every other hybrid gets an ability that can help them during a combat
situation. Why don't rangers?

So I'm seriously considering retiring my Ranger, but I thought I'd come see
what everybody thought about rangers. Do you like Rangers? Are they helpful?
What are the pros and cons of being a ranger?
