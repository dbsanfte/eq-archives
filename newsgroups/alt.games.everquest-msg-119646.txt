Anybody who says they are going to petition you are just trying to scam you.
Do NOT give your weapon to anyone!!!!!  They don't have to give it back and
Verant won't back you up when you go to them complaining 'Someone stole my
sword' because you gave them the sword.


What server do you play on?  I may be able to give you some tips and meet
you one day to run interference on the idiots trying to steal from you.
