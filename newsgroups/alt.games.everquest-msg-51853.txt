I've not played all the classes, so I won't say what I think is the 4th
best, but I can state that the rumors and "General Consensus" that
enchanters can't solo is complete and total bunk. I make it a point to
solo my chanter at least one full level between ranks for no other reason
than it's the only way I can get my defense skill to rise. (I don't get
hit much in groups. For some reason, the rest of my group won't let me
stand there and take it ;-) Pet has great damage output and soloing with
it is fairly simple. Tash to pull, Mez on it's way in, which buys me the
time to slow it and drop the first DoT. Mob hits, pet engages and I step
back and start lobbing bombs on it to make sure I do more damage than pet
does. Sure it blows 2/3 of my mana, but I am my very own crack dealer ;-)  
Give me 3 minutes and we're back at it again...

It's also terrifyingly simple to charm solo a Chanter. A really good
charm soloist is, in my not so humble opinon, superior to all other
soloists.. even the druids and their fearsome quad-kiting ability.

Grab a "high green" that's an under-con to begin with and you've got 5
minutes or more you can have that thing laying waste to 4 or 5 blues
before you have to put the poor thing down.  (Green mobs rarely if ever
break charm early)  Griffawns in EK come to mind.. big undercon. Green at
20 and could chew through 4 or 5 (slowed) blue gnoll reavers before it was
time to mem-blur it and kill it, for even more exp. 4 to 6 mobs dead for
one bub of mana? Which I'll get back when I go looking for my next pet?

It's none-stop slaughter.

Of course... poorly timed charm breaks are also the most exhilirating of
experiences ;-)
