Ah well - I'm part of the MTV generation...I have to have instant
gratification or it suxxors (kidding!)

So I hear.  </shudder> How did people cope?  I started playing about a
month after Velious was launched (around Jan 2001) so all I've ever
known was the blue / yellow exp bar.  Now that I've hit 52 I'm putting
50% to AA (despite the best evidence to the contrary on this NG) (hehe
perhaps 100% when I get near 53 until I get that CoF that
I...dammit...NEED!) but I still say it would be nice to see a bit of
movement in xp per kill.

Good hunting to you all...
