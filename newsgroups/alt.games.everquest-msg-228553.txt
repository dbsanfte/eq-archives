Yeah.  It will mostly help at low levels, so will raise by a level or two
the average level at which people stop leveling and go do PvP.

However, if any guild *does* level up and, say, take down Naggy and/or Vox,
they get some major bragging rights.  Imagine that raid--one mistake that
wipes the raid, and the whole guild is back to level 1.  You get no test
runs to work out strategy or get your timing down.
