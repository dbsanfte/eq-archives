they were still gun toting loonies, and the lady, although I stress this
was a tragedy and shouldn't have happened, I guess it was a case of
itchy finger. I make no excuses and the guy should be hauled over the
coals in two directions!

I saw it too...He was definitely a fruitcake, and I have problems
believing the testimony of neo-nazis etc, but I would say that there did
seem to be some knowledge of the bomb....but there will always be this
kind of theory bandied about when these things happen, in an attempt to
justify the actions of a madman. I do believe that a lot of the
government crap in America is simply cash, I've written a poem about it
before getting involved in this debate. I think the whole American
system is cash controlled and always will be.
