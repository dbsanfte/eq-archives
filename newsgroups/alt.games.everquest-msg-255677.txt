Sorry, bad use of terms on my part.  I should've said I have a KEY
tied to it, not a "hotkey".  Using the Options:Keyboard window, I've
tied ctrl-F9 to first person camera, shift-F9 to top view, and
ctrl-shift-F9 to the user defined camera that I've made a third
person wide angle view.

But I can't do anything about your 5 years of inertia. :)

The user defined camera retains whatever angle you've last set it at, and
does not change when the character turns.  So you can approach the mobs,
switch to that camera and circle it around so it's looking through you
toward the mobs, switch back to first person, tag the target, spin around
and start running (I find it easier to do this in first person, but as I
said I'm getting better at judging which way I'm facing in third person),
then switch views to see what's following you.

It works especially well for my monk (and, I assume, any other FD class),
since when I feign I can easily watch what the mobs are doing, but when
I stand up I'm still positioned for running.  Indeed, if I'm in a place
where running takes a lot of navigation, I'll sometimes FD while in first
person, then switch to third to check what's behind me.  (Doesn't help
your Berserker, I know.)

Thanks for the explanation(s)!
