Yeah, I use OE too, and I've had this problem occasionally.  It's annoying,
and doubly so because if it crashes on a reply once, it'll generally crash
every time you try to reply to that post.  Bad as it is to type out a long
reply and lose it, it's worse when you try again and lose the next one you
type, after going to all the trouble to try to remember exactly what you
were saying the first time... :/
