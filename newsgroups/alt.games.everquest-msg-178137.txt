After Dark
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

What's that in the corner?
It's too dark to see.
What's that noise I'm hearing?
Who's that calling me?

Long ago and far away I heard your voice
Once I heard you sing your song I had no choice
Terror took control and told me what to say
And let me loose, I fear I've finally found a way

After dark, I see you
After dark, I feel you
After dark, I want you
After dark, I need you

Of age there is no question
Death's shadow is undone
We only need each other
And shelter from the sun

Long ago and far away I heard your voice
Once I heard you sing your song I had no choice
Terror took control and told me what to say
And let me loose, I fear I've finally found a way

After dark, I need you
After dark, I want you
After dark, I feel you
After dark, I see you

There's no turning back now
My fate is traced in blood
I've tasted true salvation
Your power is my drug

Long ago and far away I heard your voice
Once I heard you sing your song I had no choice
Terror took control and told me what to say
And let me loose, I fear I've finally found a way

After dark, I need you
After dark, I want you
After dark, I feel you
After dark, I see you
After dark, I touch you
After dark, I doooooo
After dark, after dark, after dark
