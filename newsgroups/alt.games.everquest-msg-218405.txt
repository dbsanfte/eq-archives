Wrong 'exit timer'.

I'm talking about the one they added shortly after the suicide, the one 
you and everyone else here probably told to go away and never popup 
again. The one that at login asks you to specify an alarm time so you 
can leave the game before you get 'so immersed in it you lose track of 
your life'.

The LD/quit/disconn timer you describe above has always been there 
afaik, and its purpose is as you state it.
