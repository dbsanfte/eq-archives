Well Jazz answered this one well, so i won't bother.

Harm touch does not have a skill number so much as it's damage is tied
into your level.  IIRC the Formula is (10*Level)+1.  I am sure some one
will correct me if this isn't the correct formula but its close.  Your
harm touch will go up as your level does.  My Shadowknight has only
gotten to around level 18, and has never had it resisted, that doesn't
mean it can't be, but nothing I have fought in my few levels has
resisted it.  I would guess it will be more into your twenties and 
thirties on up when mob magic resistance starts to go up as well.

I actually spent a good deal of time soloing "old" befallen (not sure
which version is up any more as it keeps flip flopping) on the first
floor or so, from about level 9 to 14.  Najena is pretty much empty as
everyone says.  Basically you will need to make friends to get raiding
parties together for most old world dungeons anymore.  Unrest is
probably the only one you could still find a pick up group for.  Cazic
Thule will be a good choice in your late 20/early 30's so you can get
the drops for your Sol Ro class armor, which is required for the SK
epic.

 I've spent a fair

Make friends.  Go to some of the zones you don't want to play in and
make friends.  It's very hard to find pick up groups for the lower end
dungeons like befallen, as the loot is generally crap these days, might
not be so bad on FV, but my guess is it will still be considered crap,
even if people are using lesser gear, as there will be next to no "true
newbies" on FV, and prejudices are hard to overcome.
