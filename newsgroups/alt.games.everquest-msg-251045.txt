Considering that from the POK stone to Paineel, the run was Tox to 
Paineel (book is right outside), Paineel to Warrens (again, a pretty 
short run), thru Warrens (longest part of the journey) to Stonebrunt, 
then across half the bottom of Stonebrunt to Gunthak, elapsed time with 
SOW four minutes plus any zoning time, thru mobs that are all green to 
pretty much anyone who would be hunting in Gunthak+, this doesn't strike 
me as a big deal.

Emerald Forest is even more of a joke, its what, a minute from the 
Cabalis port?  Skyfire?  Thats what, a minute from the OT port? 
Grimling Forest is perhaps three minutes from the Shadeweaver port, 
Twilight Sea is the only port on your list I'd consider worth looking 
for, because getting there will require moving across high level KOS 
mobs or going extraordinarily long distances.

You leave Wakening Lands off your list entirely, and that port shaves at 
least five minutes off the time from Great Divide stone, and again thru 
territory thats likely to be hostile to most people (Giant Faction being 
the least popular of the three, and Cobalt Scar, which is yet another 
five minutes of running thru yet another probably KOS zone (how many 
people are not KOS to both dragons and giants?).  A "Skyshrine" stone in 
CS or in WL would be, to me, the big killer stone that should finish off 
the port business, such as it is.
