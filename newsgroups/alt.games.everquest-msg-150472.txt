I too am using a linksys router. After a few days of banging my head against
the setup, things are going fine and no disconnects.

 I tested my system security at Shieldsup and a few other test sites. They
show me to be stealth/secure whether I use a firewall or not. Does anyone
know if this could be misleading me ? I have several firewalls Blackice,
Freedoom, Zonealarm but have not used them since the router shows being
stealthed/secure.

Thanks
