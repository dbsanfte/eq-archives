I used to do AOE groups all the time with my Wiz.  The hardest bit of
the whole thing is gathering the pulls together tightly.  My mate (a
cleric used to have DA up and do the pulling to the AOE group.
(Wizzies were arranged in a box formation but still close.  He would
pull the mobs to the centre of the box .. Chanter would stun .. cleric
click off DA/DB and join the chain stunning ... the cleric also has an
AOE stun .. spam healing if needed. Probably the best AOE type group we
used was:

1 x Enchanter
1 x Cleric
4 x Wizzies

This was pre-LDoN but the end result should be the same.
