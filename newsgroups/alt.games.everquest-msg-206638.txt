The major change is they've got player and guild housing now.  Here's what
housing gives you:

    1. You can hire merchants to operate out of the house.  They will give
    you a discount on what they sell.

    2. You can put tradeskill equipment in your house.  Combine this with #1
    and the house becomes a very good place to do your tradeskills.

    3. I believe houses have storage vaults--kind of like a private bank.

    4. There's some kind of port system involving houses, making travel from
    houses to the frontier port keeps fast, and maybe to some other places.

    5. When you die, you can choose to respawn in your house instead of at
    your bind point.

    6. There's some kind of access list for the house, controlling who can
    come in.  I *think* this can work with #3 to make a shared storage area
    among a group of people.

The housing is implemented in new zones connected to the main cities, so
there won't be houses just popping up anywhere.  You can only build on lots
in those zones.  The lots are grouped to form towns and villages.

The pricing is interesting...the lots are being sold with a reverse auction.
Each lot has a price, and if you are willing to pay that price, you can buy
it.  The price started out very very high (in EQ terms, think something like
a million plat), but is automatically dropping every so often.

I'd never understood why people wanted housing in MMORPGs, but looking at
the description of the DAoC housing, I can see the attraction, especially
for guild houses.  Having a place for the guild with component and
tradeskill vendors that give a discount, tradeskill equipment, a guild
vault, and a quick port to the house so it is easy for the guild to gather
for raids would be very nice.
