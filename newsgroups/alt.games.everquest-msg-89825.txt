 54 cleric/warrior is more than likely enough for the King camp. I can't
remember but at 54 you more than likely can pull singles. Two at the
most. The only problem I see is you don't have anyone to snare. Froggy
King seems to flee a little earlier than other froggies, so if he's not
snared he can make it pretty far if he resists a root or stun.
Especially if he's been SoWd by Shaman frogs, which is only usually an
issue on a fresh break. I'd try finding a druid or a wizard (or SK or
necro) to go along with you so you'll have someone to snare.

 You shouldn't have any problem finding the camp open, in most cases. At
least on my server there's usually nobody there. When they are it's just
to get crowns and they move on. If I can remember correctly (which I
probably can't) there are 6 frogs in his room, not including King. Two
on each side and two up on the ledges in front of him. At 60 I can
single pull King from his room but not sure how it would work at 54.
