  I think this change went in with the patch before this one.  Before the
big NPC buff patch, apparently all enchanters had a chance to land their
spells regardless of the level/MR of the target, which would explain why
NPCs could charm basically anyone.

  From the sounds of this part of the patch message, I think it will mean
that you will see improved resists when green mobs cast DD spells on you.
From the sounds of it though, there won't be any significant reduction in
the damage you'd take from spells cast by mobs you'd actually be fighting
for experience... just a bit lessening of the danger/annoyance factor of
getting clobbered by greens.
