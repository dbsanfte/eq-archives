I have done some looking around to get information on the two different
tunics with Fungal Regrowth effect.  There is the original one in OS, and
there is one that appears to be identical, except for who can wear it, that
drops in Fungus Grove.  According to the information I have found, the
effect is triggered, can be used only while wearing it, and in addition to
the 15 pt/tick regen has a built in snare of up to 90 percent.  First could
someone who has used one verify the information I have found, as it has been
gleaned from several places, and what I have found has been somewhat
contradictory.  The other thing I am interested in knowing is whether or not
it stacks with regen spells, such as Regrowth.  Thank you in advance.
