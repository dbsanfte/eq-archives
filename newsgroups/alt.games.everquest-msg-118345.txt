Heh.

Nice. I think I paid 600 for mine a while back. Sold my crown of
leaves for 400, though : )

I recall a time when I didn't have a single piece of resist gear -
when I was wearing the gear I'd recycled from my first incarnation,
which had been level 39. Every single number in the resist portion of
inventory was white and remained that way till I exchanged my lizzy
scale cloak with a kunzar cloak a human druid friend had bought and
couldn't wear. I was so impressed with myself when my fire resist was
a whopping 50 at level 49.

No. There are whips, though, but the only one I can think of is no
drop. And if *I* had money for that,  I'd buy a Lodi shield instead.

Spend some time in Kael and see if you can get the Thurg quest bracer
instead, then :)
(Oh, and I'm not really 59 yet. Was going to ding last night but ran
off to help a guildie with an epic mob. Will do it tonight instead)

I tried filling in a base value for AC to see if it'd give any
results, but nothing happened.
