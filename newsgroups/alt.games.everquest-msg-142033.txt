    We've just started the nightly explorations. Cleared to TVK, most of the
raid camped where the Akhevan Warders spawn - and then the server crashed
again. =/ It's been fun, and so far we haven't seen too much in the way of
"OMG total suckage!" loot.

    The only boss so far we've had to try a second time was DXXT, because
the scout monks didn't trigger the silence (so we didn't know about it) and
we lost too many initial tanks to it. Then, after we ressed up and were
discussing how to adjust, a shaman that camped the first fight logged in too
close and auto-pulled it - and we won that time. ;-) Really, some of the
trash pulls are tougher - I'd rather face the bosses than something like a 3
Eom pull. (Especially if they're Thalls. Ugh.)

    From what we've seen, we think we can set up a gimp mage/evacer combo in
every boss room we've done so far. That would make the zone loads of fun,
for us and for pearl vendors across Norrath!

> Great zone, wonderful decor

    It's nice once you get further in. I was worried after I zoned in that
it would all be like the zone area. I was thrilled to find out it isn't.

> Oh, and the blind SUCKS heh.

    I'm lucky - as a cleric I can stay out of range of the blind to do my
job. I remember when we first were learning the pulls and everything came
right into the middle of camp - blind stinks.

    I figure the real junk will get focus effects and some stat boosts added
eventually. You read on FoH's site how the zone was itemized in a week by
someone that had never done that before? Lame. Even lamer is that designer
is now a FoH member, but what can you do....
