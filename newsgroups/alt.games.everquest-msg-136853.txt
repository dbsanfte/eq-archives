to a bluebie server.

Finally, they allow these sort of transfers.

Most of the time, Tallon Zek was ok, but being an iksar monk on that server is pretty miserable,
frankly.  Vulnerability to being PK'd while soloing is an ever present problem that I'm tired of dealing
with, on top of the normal faction problems.  I usually had to carry PvP gear rather than gear that
I wanted to use against mobs.  I had to carry pumice stones, and SvM armor... as much as I could
afford with my level 25 iksar monk main.

And I still lost frequently, because I'd get ganked by groups of two or three other players in a group
out just for killing and looting the corpse.  Often I was getting ganked by these mini-PK groups that
were cross-teamed grouped... so another iksar was buffing and healing the guy attacking me.  How
fun.

Many times, the PK'ers were pretty good-natured.  Recently, a Paladin/Shaman team
PK'd my monk in LoIO, and then gave me a rez so that I wouldn't have to do the corpse run.  On the
other hand, a great deal of the shouting on Tallon Zek is stuff like  "i owned u... u lighty twink, .%$(@(#,
if you hdnt had a oor heeler id have stomped u!!!!"  blah blah blah. Yawn.  Teenagers...what'd ya
gonna do?

In any case, while PvP can be an interesting challenge sometimes, I'm tired of having to defend against
it while doing quests.  It just gets old and annoying.

So long Tallon Zek!
