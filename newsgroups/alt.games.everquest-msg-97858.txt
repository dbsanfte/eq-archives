I thought it was;

100cp = 1SP
100sp = 1GP
100gp = 1PP
100pp = 1MP (Mithril)

Am I wrong? Assuming I am and it's 1000gp for a plat.

I don't think cash has the value in DAoC as it does in EQ...there is less
trading between characters, from what I have seen, so whereas 16k could
nicely and quickly outfit a mid level character I'm not sure how much
shopping you'd have to do in DAoC to do the equivalent, remember Items wear
out in that game and there is a good chance that when someones finished with
a weapon it's also worn out.

I am not sure about it being easier to make cash in DAoC, I think it is
easier to keep yourself with funds while levelling (whereas it is easy in EQ
to be 40th level and only have a couple of hundred plat to your name) but
due to the less player demand for bought items I don't think you can get
extravegantly rich as easily (there is no farming in DAoC, the game has a
TLC built in) and as a weapon above your level will wear out faster and not
be anymore effective it is far better to actually work for items. Quests
rarely involve more than a couple of hours a camp and if there is more than
one after the item they can just group and all receive it. So all in all
that money is worth far more in EQ than it is DAoC, just thru the nature of
the game.
