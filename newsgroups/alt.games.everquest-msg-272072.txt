No kidding!  My husband and I can comfortably duo yellow group mobs, so we
were very frustrated to find that there were so many frigging solo mobs
around the docks!  And too far into the zone it became too tough for us at
29.

Until we discovered that they actually gave about 1/5 of the xp of group
mobs *and* we could kill 5 in the time it took to kill one group mob with
me not needing to heal at all...so it's all good.

Course, it left us with a quandry...do we "steal" mobs that are rightfully
meant for groups, or do we mow through mobs rightfully meant for soloers?
<:(  One of the downsides of being a group-mob-capable duo is that groups
don't even blink about moving into our space, because they assume we are
only doing solo mobs, and woe betide us if we ask they to respect us as
they'd respect another full group!  (I got a nice "Take your powergamer
ways away from the RP server!" this morning when I asked them to stop
taking mobs we were setting up to engage.  Meh.)
