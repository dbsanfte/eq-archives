The risk was practically nil in the case if Iraq or Afganistan.  The risk 
of another terrorist attack against the United States is likely not 
significantly different than it was prior to invading Afganistan, and 
quite possibly higher after the invasion of Iraq.

While they may not have admitted it, it is an open secret anymore that 
they do indeed posess a nuclear arsenal.

The whole point behind the nuclear weapons is not that they are useful on 
the battlefield, they are used to threaten massive retailiation against 
civilian targets, cities and such.

That is nice, I'm sure that a country like North Korea would never dream 
of attacking our civilians should we be stupid enough to attack them.

The biggest reason for never going to war with the USSR is the idea of 
mutual assured destruction.
