I soloed my Shaman from 29th to 30th on mostly Zelniaks (plus some
shrooms) doing the root/rot bit.  I had never done root/rot before
(always grouped as Shaman is usually in high demand for groups but DSP
had 40+ players and no empty groups so tried to solo).  I was amazed
at how effective root/rot is.

My wizard I quad-kited wolves in DSP from about 36th to 46th (they
start light blueing out then).  Unfortunately for quad-kiting, the
zelniaks are not social so won't add making them a poor choice.  But
the wolves are plentiful and with the wolf traps all around, it is
easy to get 4 of them chasing you.

PS  DSP is very popular zone on my server (Lanys) (30-40+ almost
constantly)
