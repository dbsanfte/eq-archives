that is what I did, bought the game after playing my char when my bro bought
the game.  played it some, but never subscribed.  got to 22nd level with
blademaster and like 12th with wizard.  Like I said before, EQ is kewl
enough.  Probably my biggest problem with EQ is the 8 spell slots.  that
just totally sucks.  DAOC at least doesn't siphon you to only 8 spells.
