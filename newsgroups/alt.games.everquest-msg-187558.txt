Embrace it.  It is a Good Thing (tm)!  A lot of times I'll be grinding
with a couple guildie warriors and my cleric.  I do a lot of the
pulling.  Getting hit a few times is welcome and they'll often wait to
taunt until I've been smacked once or twice (my defense is still too
low).  Once they get taunting I have very little worry about.
