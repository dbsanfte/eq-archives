That is exactly what Teckla is saying, 34% failure rate is too high for a 
combine that you can NO LONGER SKILL UP on.  So, I guess you two are 
arguing about nothing, since you have now agreed with Teckla that this is 
what it was all about to begin with.

Personally, I agree with Teckla that that is too high a failure rate for 
something that will not allow you to skill up any more.  I know it's just 
a game design, not intended to reflect RL, but, I do agree.
