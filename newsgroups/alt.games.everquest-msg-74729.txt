As far as katta you don't seem to need a particular faction for that
ethreal long sword. If the guy gives you the quest you are good.

As far as the aegis of life it used to take like max warmly but I
think they changed it and just warmly is fine. I'd get warmly and some
just to be sure. Its so easy to get warmly also, my dark elf cleric of
inny is allied to qeynos guards, priests and paladins of qeynos. Do
the six bone chips in a box paladin quest after buying out a few
hundred bone chips from vendors or turn in bandit sashes in the same
area. She's never done that quest because I lost patience with such
camps long ago and refuse to do any such camp now.

No, you can't really assume that. It works for many quest but one
newer example is that you need at least kindly for thurg armor (or
both parties do for mulitquesting it) and allied for skyshrine and
kael armors (ditto on mulitquesting) They will give you the quest
anyway before that.

Depends totally on the quest. Luclin so far (from my experience) seems
to have gone back to the "if the npc gives you the quest you are fine"
old model. At least so far in several luclin quests I've completed not
worrying about faction I got the items. I was apprehensive with a guy
in seru that I turned in stuff for lightcrawler armor with and I got
it. I did the etheral longsword quest you mention at I believe indiff
or less and got it.
