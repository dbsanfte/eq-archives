Ack, thats correct, upper left, not upper right.  The positions are also
numbered faintly, if you look carefully, so another way of saying this would be
"the lowest numbered slot"

Automating the hotkeyed slots for that food and drink wouldn't cost you any
more food consumption than clicking them yourself, and you'd never forget to do
it... but you will have to suffer the "you aren't hungry" message spam all the
time.

If you are the sort to remember to do this frequently, then the automation
isn't at all necessary
