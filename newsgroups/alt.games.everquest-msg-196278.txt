Actually, that's what happens when a couple of dimwits decide to have the 
rarest components for several classes' quest armor drop from the same four 
of five grouped mobs in the newbie area. I felt like I had to take a number 
or something to get a chance at one of the mobs. Then you have the people 
who feel they can monopolize the camp as long as they like, "Halflings are 
camped, gyfcvw!" Blow me. This looks like an exception to camping courtesy 
if ever there was one.
