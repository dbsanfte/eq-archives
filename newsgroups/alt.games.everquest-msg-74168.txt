Level 45 is without any doubt the hardest level I have yet encountered, it
took me forever to get out of it, and I'm grateful that I didn't die in the
level to give me a setback. I've managed to race through to level 51 now,
and whilst 51 *is* slow, it's nowhere near as bad as 45. My advice to anyone
that's struggling in 45, is simply to hang in there, as soon as you're out
you'll be 51 in no time at all. Whether this is true or not I'm not sure,
but I've heard from many people 59 is *the* hardest level, followed by 45
...

And BTW Mr. jaZZ, you sure did put the hex on me, I've died four times this
past week! LOL

Stevie.
