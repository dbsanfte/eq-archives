Actually from everything I've read Troll and Iksar get a 20% xp penalty, so
basically you have to earn a full bubble of xp more than someone with a
standard xp to get each level.  It of course gets progressively worse and
more noticeable.  BUT if you are playing a solo character the regen does
actually speed up the rate at which you are killing in some cases so it
balances out.  Where it starts to hurt is when you're in a group and killing
things at the same rate as a troll as if you were a human.  Then yes it can
start to hurt.

My Beastlord is a Troll and yes the xp penalty hurts a bit, but not enough
that I've ever once considered re-rolling him.
