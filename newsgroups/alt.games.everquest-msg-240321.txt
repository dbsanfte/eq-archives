As posted at one of the fansites. Some of these have been mentioned in
different places and posts here, but here's the complete list. Also a
few of these numbers are questionable.


 Fast facts about EverQuest
� Over 2.5 million copies of the game and its expansions have been
sold in box or digitally downloaded since 1999.
� If stacked end to end, the total number of EverQuest boxes created
would reach a height of more than 265 miles, which would stretch out
of the Earth�s atmosphere and past the orbit of the International
Space Station.
� EverQuest averages about 250,000 new subscribers every year.
Currently, there are more than 420,000 people playing the game.
� At peak times, more than 100,000 people around the globe will be
playing EverQuest simultaneously. Heaviest hours of operation for
EverQuest are from 5PM Pacific Standard Time to 11PM PST, with the
biggest days being Thursday and Sunday � traditionally, the biggest
nights for prime-time television viewing.
� There are almost 12 million characters created by players within the
game. Of these 12 million, more than 3 million have been played in the
last six months.
� The oldest EQ player is 78 (part of three generations of a single
family that play together from different states). The youngest is 9
(he plays with his mother and father).
� There are more than 1 million non-player characters populating the
world of EverQuest, made up of nearly 400 unique types of creatures.
� Total play time for all current players in the game equals more than
184,000 years.
� Only 17% of the characters played within EverQuest are human. 83%
are comprised of the fourteen other fantasy races available in the
game.
� EverQuest currently has more than 420,000 inhabitants, making the
game�s population larger than 42 of America�s state capitals. Based on
2000 Census figures, EQ�s population is four times that of Berkeley,
CA, Springfield, IL and Gary, IN; three times that of Pasadena, CA,
Hartford, CT, Lansing, MI or Tallahassee, FL; twice the population of
Orlando, FL, Des Moines, IA, Providence, RI or Richmond, VA; and
roughly equal in population to Atlanta, GA, Kansas City, MO, Fresno,
CA and Virginia Beach, VA.
� There are over 350 square miles of dungeons, mountains, plains,
valleys, cities and forests to explore in the game.
� There are more than 40,000 unique items for players to discover,
create or buy within the game. More than 3,000 of these items have
never been discovered by players.
� There are almost 100,000 trees within the world of EverQuest.
� More than 1500 servers run the world of EverQuest, which is the
equivalency of one of the world�s top 100 supercomputers. More than 18
miles of wire and cable connect all these boxes together.
� Over 10 quadrillion bytes of EverQuest data have left the SOE
network in the past five years. That�s a ten, followed by 15 zeroes.
