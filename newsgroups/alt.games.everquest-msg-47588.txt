In that case, I hope you realize that the trivial on imbued jewelry is
AFAIK awfully high, and that imbued emerald jewelry pretty much bites.
For instance, platinum emerald rings are AC 4 10 svfire, platinum
imbued emerald rings are AC 4, 8 svfire, 2 svdisease, 4 dex and -4 str
- in addition to the fact that fire and disease resists are hardly
needed at the same time, can you think of any class/race who could
wear this that would give up 4 str for 4 dex, especially when most
Tunare worshippers aren't exactly strong to begin with? The Karana
imbue does the same thing, but at least it compensates by being a free
gem and giving some wisdom.

However, there's a third cultural option you're forgetting: pottery
idols. If you skill up high enough, you could make tunare range slot
idols with some decent stats, including 3 wis. You'd need help from a
rogue to make glaze, but you'd be able to use your imbues, and raising
pottery skill is much cheaper than jewelcraft as well as much faster
than tailoring. Also, you'll have an enchanter to help out with
getting mana vials :)

And for the fourth option: if your enchanter is a high elf, you could
teach her to smith. On her own, she could make enchanted mithril
armor, and with the druid's help she could make imbued enchanted
mithril armor. Tunare imbued smithed armor is, unlike the jewelry,
very nice stuff indeed. Heck, you could run around with a light blue
uberdruid dressed in homemade armor one day! :) (Also, I believe
skilling up as a smith will be cheaper than skilling up in jewelcraft)
