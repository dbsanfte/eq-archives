"It's not a democracy" So you are saying user input and requests for 
features that these paying customers want to see are not appropriate? 
I'm glad you are not in management at SOE or any other MMO company for 
that matter.

As far as I am concerned customers of any product or service have every 
right to tell the companies they fork over their hard earned cash to 
exactly what they want for their money. I don't operate a business 
myself but that approach to paying customers seems like a pretty 
fundamental thing to me, within reason obviously. I mean, if 299,999 
account holders are pleased there is no real option for solo play and 
one account holder has a real problem with that, well then the best that 
can be done is to wish that person well and suggest another game like 
say, WoW.

But that is not the case here. A lot of people like the option to play 
solo sometimes and some even want to do it all of the time. So what? Why 
not let them? That just makes more customers happy and that generates 
more sales and more profits. What exactly is the problem with giving 
paying customers what they want for their money?

A criticism I often read in regards to those who like to solo in MMOs is 
what are they doing playing an MMO at all if they want to play by 
themselves? Well, the answer is pretty simple really. There are no 
single player worlds in existence that can compare to the vast worlds in 
MMOs. Is there any game the with the size, scope and complexity of 
EverQuest available in the realm of single player RPGs? No, there is 
not. Secondly, I think some people who like to solo still enjoy being in 
a world that is populated by other real people and not just entirely 
computer controlled npcs.

The more flexible a game of this kind can be in terms of pleasing the 
largest number of potential players, the better I say. I understand WoW 
allows it's players to go solo or group as they please and in all cases 
to be able to actually get something done and have fun regardless of 
whether they are grouped or not. Good for them! Yeah, EverQuest II could 
take a lesson from WoW here in my opinion.
