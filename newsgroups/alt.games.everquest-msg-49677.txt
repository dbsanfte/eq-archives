Several times. Sometimes it is just a week, twice it has been several
months. It is refreshing to go back.


No matter how good the game (any game, EQ is hardly alone here) is, it does
wear on you, either through the monotony of the game itself, or through the
politics, or whatever...and it helps a lot to take a breather. Personally,
if there isn't some new game that I want to go to, I'll fire up an older
game that I haven't played in years, or one that I never got around to
finishing, and do that one instead.
