My skill is 250, only thing I can really sell at a profit is 6ac 65hp rings.
Only really make a profit if I make the ring from a Fire Opal I have looted,
otherwise the 55pp from vendor makes the margins quite low. Xegony price for
these rings is 400-450pp. Bar of Velium is 263pp + gem 55pp is 318pp cost
price. Selling at 400pp per ring doesn't yield much PP to be worth the
effort considering fails.
