sigh, I wish my 41 druid had wisdom that high.  I don't have oodles of 
cash to spend on good wisdom stuff... and I have no idea how to improve 
my wisdom without money.  There's gotta be stuff I can get with a group 
that I can use.  Don't even be talking about no raid force because I'll 
never see that in this lifetime.
