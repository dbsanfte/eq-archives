Dont think you have to worry about where you hunt in Marus Seru regardless
of race.  My Iksar Shadow Knight was at the least Dubious to all the guards,
whether they be Hand Of Seru, or Haven Guards.

As far as loot goes, yes, it basically sucks, but the Exp IS fabulous. If
you hunt Recuso though you can offset your Food/BAndage costs at the least
though.
