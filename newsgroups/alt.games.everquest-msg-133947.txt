I have heard that there is a new zone of surefall glade, that exists on the
legends server or the test server, not sure which... does anyone have any
experience of it? It would be nice if there were mobs to get good faction
with the rangers there; i have an iksar monk who is trying to annoy cazic
thule by buddying up to the good guys ;-)

Poachers head quest is just a pain if you are kos to start with. I like
crushbone though; faction city! ally in everything you can get from killing
orcs...

well i was till they nerfed my max faction. Oh well.
