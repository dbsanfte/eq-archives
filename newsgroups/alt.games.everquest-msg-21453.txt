Ah, you've got it pretty easy, being a low level monk...I wouldn't worry
about dying (notice the spelling everyone <no one can spell "dying"correctly
;p> ) too much.

Breaking in to Hate (zoning in, then running to the Safe Spot) is the time
you're most likely to die...and being a monk you'll have a better chance of
surviving than the wizard next to you.  I'm sure your guild has given you
instructions on how to get to the SS, along with a link to a map or two of
Hate.

Once the break-in CRs are done, just listen.  There'll be a puller (probably
a monk, but not you) and a picker.  Don't do ANYTHING until the picker says
to, and make sure you assist the picker or whomever they decide is the main
tank.  But /assisting is old hat to you, I'm sure.

Then just beat on the critter.  It shouldn't aggro too much on you since
you're not doing the damage higher level monks and warriors are doing, but
if one decides it really hates you, FD.

Don't let it being "The Planes" psych you out.  I mean, big whoop, it's a
multi-party raid.  The rules are the same as when you killed stuff in CT or
SolB.  You have a lot of people going with you...pretty much overkill for
that zone, so it shouldn't be too overwhelming.
