Located in London? I should be a mere hop or two away from the servers.
Let's see them blame 'the Internet' or 'my ISP' now mwuhahahahahah!!!!

I should also, theoretically, be able to get an engaged tone on Tech

(note for the humour impaired: Please ask for assistance if you are not
equipped to manage the above sentence)

Ideally, they would offer a free account transfers for people with
European billing addresses, but personally, I think I've got too many
friends on Zeb to ever dream of moving at this point
