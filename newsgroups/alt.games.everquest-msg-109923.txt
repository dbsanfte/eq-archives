Thanks for all the GREAT advice on getting started as a DE cleric!  I am
wondering now if you can help me with another question - Wisdom gear.

I may be coming into some PP soon, so I'd like to get some kind of a list of
reasonably priced equipment I could get.  I may have as little as 400pp, or
as much as 1.5k (all depends on a dear friend of mine and what they can sell
a certain item for).

right now, I have no +wis gear. some +str, 2 serpentine bracers and
apolished bone hoop (+10 mana I think) but that's about it.  What should I
try to get?  I'm planning on doing a few of the quests suggested below, but
I'm going to work FP faction first at the Orc camps in the commons or in
Nektulous.

Also any suggestions would be greatly appreciated on how to get to Greater
Faydark (my server's auction zone) without being killed would be appreciated
as well.

Thanks!
