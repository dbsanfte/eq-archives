Hmm. You're hurting my head, now.

You see, I have an incredible love for alternate history, whether it
involves time-travel or not, and also for secret history. Therefore I
find it hard to pass up the beauty that is TERMINATOR 2, even for
ALIEN. Now, the problem is that BLADE RUNNER is an excellent film, but
I don't think it's much fun to watch. Beautiful, impressive,
spellbinding, but not a lot of fun.

I disregard the original TERMINATOR as less interesting than its
sequel, by the way.

I suppose you might have to look at James Cameron as being a rather
unimpressive director who managed to produce two or three very
accomplished films, while Ridley Scott is a talented director with a
few unfortunate credits to his name - but, then again, even his
unentertaining films are remarkable achievements.
