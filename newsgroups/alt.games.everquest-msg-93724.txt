I was having the same problem (occassional horrible frame rates after
zoning, had to restart game to fix) for a while.  I have not had it
occur since I changed textures from high to medium and turned dynamic
lighting off (did not test these changes separately).  For reference,
I have all Luclin models turned on, and my system has an Athlon XP
1600+,  GeForce2 Ti video, and 512MB RAM.

Also, a separate issue, I had awful video lag and grotesque crawling
ground textures, especially in some Luclin zones.  Crawling textures
stopped and video lag was reduced when I turned hardware TnL back on
(I had turned it off based on posted advice when lag was awful back
in January).  I still had to bring my clip plane in about 20% in
Hollowshade Moor to eliminatethe still noticeable video lag.
