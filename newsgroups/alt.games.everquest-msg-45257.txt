I would agree with your assesment overall.  I have not trained my skills as
high as you, but I have trained up Smithing to 142, Baking to 136, Tailoring
to 40ish, fishing not a clue where, I just fish, and Alchemy is at 43 now, I
really need to spend some money on getting it maxed for my level.  Only
reason I do alchemy is to keep my alts and guildies in SoW potions, and some
occasional other potions.  I make a lot more SoW potions than we need so I
can sell the extras at a profit.  It's just convenient, as I can get the
ingredients at FV where I have been banking lately, or Halas via the pot
room, for SoW and a few other potions.  Gives me something to do while I am
sitting on my butt medding.  I have not bothered to get tailoring higher
because I don't need it for my cultural armor, and it's a royal pain in the
butt.  Haven't worked on jewelry because it would cost way too much for me
being a barbarian shaman.  If I decide to do jewelry, I will probably have
to make a new character.
