This is indeed spell research and each INT casting class has it's own
"research book" and materials.

Some spells (not all) are combinations of 2 runes (3 for L39+ I think) that
you but in the Lexicon and hit "Combine".

This will check your research skill and either work and yield a spell, or
fail and waste the runes.  The more you reserch, the more of a chance you
skill will increase.

eq.castersrealm.com can get you started, but www.graffe.com/ is the great
source of all thing wizardly.

Good Luck!
