More to the point, what if (god forbid) they succeed in the ruling?

Now you have a proven case that items you get ingame belong to you and
have a monetary value. Next step:

"My FS sword poofed. Please talk to my lawyers about compensation for
$0.04 financial compensation and $5million for mental anguish"

"My next gen fungi tunic with 100hp per tick regen has been nerfed to
10hp per tick. This has curtailed the transaction I had set up for
$3000, and I would like you to pay compensation."

This opens up a HUGE can'o'worms in a country where you can insure a box
of cigars, then claim for 'fire damage' when you smoke them - and win.
