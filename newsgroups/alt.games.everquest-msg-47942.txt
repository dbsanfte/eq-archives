Most other classes notice a severe fall-off in AC bonus from AGI at high
numbers (im talking near 200). I read this simply as Monks seeing better
benefits at those high numbers, which kinda makes sense given their overall
lightness. I don't think it will make a lot of difference in the
run-of-the-mill range of AGI.
