   I have a weight problem.  I'm fat.  Always have been.  Always will be.  So why
shouldn't I play EQ?  It will  keep me from exercising?  As if.  I'm fat _and_ lazy. 
It will cause me to eat junk foods instead of celery and granola?  No, I've had a
taste for fried chicken drenched with crystal hot sauce long before I heard of EQ. 
It will let me forget my problems for a few, sometimes quite a few, hour each week
where I can run around, have adventures, meet people and make friends where it really
doesn't matter _what_ I look like?  Maybe I should just hole myself up in a closet or
something and wait for death to take me.
   I also sort wonder about the "addictive personality" part.  Better to be addicted
to EQ, imho, than crack or kiddy porn.
