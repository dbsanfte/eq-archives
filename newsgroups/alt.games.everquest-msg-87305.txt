get used to programming the MA's name in. it is superior to the F2-F6  key
then /assist method.
always have an /assist hotkey made up though as well.

heres a shortcut. lots of players have horrible long names like ooiiigiliii.
and i bet you cant be bothered to squint and see how many i's the fool has
put in his name etc.

1. well make your key to say this /assist %t
2. then target ooiiigiliii
3. then press your hoytkey ( the  one you made in step 1)
4. just to check right click to see the macro has changed into "/assist
ooiiigiliii"
5. use macro to fight mobs.
