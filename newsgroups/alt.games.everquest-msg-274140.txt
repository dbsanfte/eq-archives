   What?  I'm a woman, and I've never used the word "pussy" this way.  I
ask this of the other females of the newsgroups this is coming across
to, have you ever used "pussy" this way?  Maybe somewhere, somewhere
near you maybe, there is a woman who says this on a regular basis.  But
"pussy" in my experience is used far more as an insult than as any sort
of endearment.

    Not that it matters.  You're not holding yourself to any sort of
logical standard.  You've been quoted and requoted on the post where you
say 

"rubbish it's short for "pussy cat", stop reading innuendo when there is
none.
And no it's not extremely sexist as it is not alluding to females."

   This is a direct cut and paste from a message you posted earlier in
the thread.  And every time someone quotes it back to you, you respond
with "Liar"!  When caught, deny everything and attack your accuser, eh?

  And if your accuser happens to be a woman, accuse her of being a man
hater as well.
