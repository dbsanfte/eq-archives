I started in late 2000, and have been playing ever since.  I never knew 
the game pre Kunark, and only for a short while pre Velious.  The game 
was much harder then, much more enjoyable as a result.  The world seemed 
so much larger then, with a lot less zones than it does now.  I liked the 
boats, I liked having to actually plan out going somewhere.  I liked 
having to actually worry about corpse runs.  What can I say, I'm a 
masochist.
