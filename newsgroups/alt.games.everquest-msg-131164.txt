It sounds as though the OP is an experienced player using this cleric
as an alt.  The 'normal' path for a cleric through these levels is
pretty well documented on the web.  For example, Caster's realm has a
lot of good suggestions, as does the zone level chart at Allakhazam.

This post is not meant to advocate or discourage any of these places.

If you are an experienced player, you probably have a good grasp of
the layout of Norrath, as well as how to get around.  For these types
of clerics seeking a little more adventure, I have an idea to throw in
the pot:  Get to Kurns Tower!  Aside from being extremely isolated for
any cleric class, it is a haven for leveling them through the teens.

Pros:
* The learning curve of the tower starts out easy - you begin by
fighting mobs right up against the zone line if you need to bail.
* Pickup groups are _relatively_ easy to come by.  Be prepared to have
lots of lizard friends.
* The experience points seem to pass by pretty quickly here.
* The tower is has a lot of undead mobs.  This leaves the option open
to solo, should you ever feel the need.
* You can aquire the cleric pet here, which I suspect few people know
about.  The pet is an iksar monk, and are very well tuned for melee. 
Although they don't follow commands very well, they do a great job
keeping the mobs off of you while you mow through skeletons.  The
command to activate the pet is: /ooc Cleric seeks melee partner.
* Pure healers are not common here, so you will be sought after -
especially when you are high enough to venture downstairs where the
furby/carebear/penguin mobs can harm touch for 150.
* You can make good money here by collecting bone chips, which will
not encumber you like traditional means of loot.  On my server, there
was an abundance of high level PC's seeking an insane amount of bone
chips for iksar faction - and willing to pay 5pp-7pp per stack.
* The faction seeking PC's are sometimes quite generous with high
level buffs.
* There are some rare drops here that will make you a good deal of
cash.  The Solist Icy Wand is ultra rare, and sold recently (july
2002) for 3k on my server.  The Iksar Berserker Club drops, but I
don't know the price.  There are also various non-cleric class
specific quest items that people will pay for, the fingers of the
fingered skeleton come to mind.

Cons
* The tower is difficult to get to for any cleric race that young:
    - Nearest port is Emerald Jungle, which is still a dangerous run
    - Shammies can sell you a potion for self porting to FoB
    - TD Firepot can port you into W Cab, but you a way to invis thru
the city
    - Good races: FV -> Swamp of no hope -> FoB (you need a way to
invis!)
    - Evil races: OT -> ? -> FoB (again, invis needed)
* Once you get there, you are isolated from any bank, merchant, cleric
trainer, etc.
* You are hated there by iksar guards, and I have seen them wander as
far as the entry way to the tower.
* Binding is essential, but you can't self bind until 14.  You MUST
get someone else to bind you, and the nearest 'safe' bind point is the
ruins on the southeast corner of the field of bone.


So, there are risks involved in getting there, but once you surpass
those, Kurns is great.  You could stay in there until 19 and still get
good exp, and I've seen people stay until 22.

If preparing for the trip, make sure you have lots of backpacks, a
good supply of food/water (3 stacks of each at the least), and your
level 14 spells.  Level 19 as well, if you plan on staying that long. 
If you can't afford all your spells at level 11, I suggest you pickup
Healing, Expulse Undead, and Invis vs Undead at the very least.  You
will need to find a friend that can bind (and possibly invis!) to come
along with you.

I think most tower-bound folks begin fighting in the tower at level 10
(lvls 8 or 9 if in group), so I would not be surprised if a level 9
cleric was welcome there.
