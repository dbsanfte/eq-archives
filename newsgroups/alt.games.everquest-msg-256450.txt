I liked water up to level 34 because it was a great combo tank/damage
dealer.  Sometime after 34 I got the four focus items from the Sol Ro quests
(Torch of Alna for the fire pet, Stein of Moggok for Water, Shovel of Ponz
for Earth, and Broom of Somebody for Air) and switched to mainly using fire
from 34 to 39 and fire and air from 39-51.  The focus items will give the
fire and air (and water) pets additional hps, making them better tanks.  The
fire pet is great for the DS, the air pet is great for keeping aggro on the
pet instead of you.  The air pet is also a nice group pet because of the
stun.

All that was in the days before you could buy a Girdle of Magi'Kot (pet
only, +500 hp) for a few plat in the bazaar.  When I leveled, I went through
the pain of having all the pet spells at each level (even though I usually
only used one or two per spell circle).  If I had to do it over again, I'd
probably focus on just the water and fire pets at 24, 29, and 34.  The fire
pet would be for when I had some kind of hp boost item - either the Torch of
Alna or a Girdle of Magi'Kot, the water pet would be for other occasions.  I
would make an effort to get the Torch and Broom focus items no later than 34
and then stick with the air and fire pets at 39, 44, and 49.  I will say
that, up to 51 when pets take on a bit of a different flavor, if you choose
to stick with one pet the water pet is never a bad choice.  One note - you
can buy all of the level 44 pets in Katta Castellum and all of the 39 except
Earth.
