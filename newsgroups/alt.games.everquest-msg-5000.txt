I have been feeling really bad about neglecting Lokari - now that everyone
else is apoligizing I may as well do it also...

Im sorry for missing your last birthday!

Ok, so I admit - we never met - but Im just feeling guilty about missing it
and thought I should confess! After all - it was you who taught me how to
Sew! <<

'Bout damned time you apologized.  She and I have been coresponding since
her birthday and I could tell that she'd been crying.

Bastard.
