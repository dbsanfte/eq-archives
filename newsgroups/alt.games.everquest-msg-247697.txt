I have a 53 monk with sneak at 113.  I set up a hotkey that would sneak and
un-sneak every 10 seconds, and mapped it to my Nostromo N52 keypad so it
would run constantly.

I left it for and went afk for about an hour.

When I returned, I had gotten exactly zero skillups.  None.  Nada. Zip.

I did the same thing with FD, and got it maxxed.

Any idea why I didn't get skillups on Sneak?  Don't you just get the skill
by use?

Any help would be greatly appreciated
