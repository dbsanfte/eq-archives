I'm going to go out on a limb and say you don't raid much.  Wipeouts happen,
even to experienced raiding forces.   A 3 hour wait for corpses to appear at
the zone, with every raider taking an unrezed death every time wouldn't make
raiding very much fun.

Not counting, of course, the hour and a half to two hours you spent clearing
trash mobs and guards to even be in a position to attack the raid target.
