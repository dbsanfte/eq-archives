Yes, but their applications flew in the face of conventional wisdom.

The way science is supposed to work.  Not always the case anymore.

True.  The ideas I'm challenging is that we're at the end of that process,
not in the middle.  In other words, that we've weeded out the bad theories
and replaced them with good ones.  In many cases, it seems we've taken old
theories that we didn't have the understanding to properly support, and
replaced them with more "politically correct" ones.

Not evidence against it, but lack of faith in the "evidence" for the idea.
It's based on some big assumptions that are just taken for granted.  We've
got an elaborate stack of best guesses on top of best guesses, all based on
the best information availabe at the time, with some "blind" science serving
as filler.  My faith in such a concotion is lacking... let's just say that
I'm a bit skeptical.

Heh, I've seen some try it.  Not sure where they get their initial
concentration of carbon from, though, since the C-14 used in carbon dating
is a beta-minus decay daughter of nitrogen (if I recall properly, it was
just an asside when I was in Power School, so I didn't pay much attention to
it, I had other matters to study).  My instinct on that, though, is it's
more a problem with the reporter not understanding, or filling in gaps with
their lack of knowledge, than it is with bad science.
