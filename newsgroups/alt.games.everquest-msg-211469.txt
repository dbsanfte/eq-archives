=)  I've been trying to take the NDA somewhat seriously.  However, I notice
that just about all the juicy details I could share have *already* been
revealed in things like the LDoN Developer's Chat they had a couple of days
ago, as well as stuff released on the LDoN web site.  So I don't feel so bad
for the things that I've revealed so far.

> -15 minutes to get to the dungeon

I've seen different numbers, I think they're still fine-tuning.  Either way,
I've never taken more than five minutes to get to a dungeon, even if it's
two zones away.

> -1 hour to complete the dungeon task

This is *highly* variable.  I've been on 30-minute dungeons and 90-minute
dungeons.

Heh, well, there *is* this neat spell called, I believe, Eye of Zomm...

Well... I have yet to actually group with a rogue.  All the adventures we've
taken so far have not *required* a rogue.

I won't comment about the specifics of the traps, only to say that they're
nasty.

/shrug  I just think that, in general, it's good to have a couple of
self-clickies in your first slot or two.  I myself always have Koadic's
Heightened Focus in my first slot because I simply have to right-click my
shawl if the buff gets dispelled.  In one dungeon I had to Virtue the Main
Tank twice before finally giving him BoR and *then* giving him Virtue.

In general, buff management is no more difficult than you would find in any
zone if you manage buffs intelligently.

Hmm.  Well, let me say a couple of things: itemization hasn't been
implemented yet in the public beta, so I have no experience with "treasure"
from the dungeons.  But I've done just fine without a rogue so far.  Yeah, I
need to burn some mana healing people after getting hit by a trap, but it's
not been overly onerous so far.

Also, as revealed in the Developer's Chat, you get "Adventure Points" for
completing a dungeon.  You then use these "Adventure Points" to purchase
loot.  (There are specific vendors you go to in order to buy loot, but
again, they have nothing for sale so far.)  So you will be able to get loot
just fine without having to ever worry about the chests.

I'd love to say more - y'all know I'm not exactly shy about expressing
myself - but I really can't say any more.  Once the NDA is lifted, I'll be
more than happy to write up "Monual's Adventures in LDoNland".
