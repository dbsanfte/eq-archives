Language is really weird.

You only benefit from skill advances after zoning.  Rumor has it that you
LOSE these advancements if you don't zone before you camp after a language
session.  If you're not seeing it after SEVERAL zones, though, you may have
a bug on your hands, and you'll want to send a bug report (and maybe even
petition).
