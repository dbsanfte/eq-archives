Your logic here is flawed.  Yes, killing one mob they each take only 
1/4th the damage they would have soloing it, but they must kill two mobs 
in order to equal the exp of killing one mob (without considering the 
grouping bonus).  This means that they end up each taking half the 
damage they would have via soloing, to get the same base exp.  Add the 
two half damages together and you get the same damage taken to get the 
same amount of exp hmm, ok your logic isnt' flawed after all I just 
wasn't following it all the way.  The benefit is that they each then 
heal at their normal rate, pathetic as it is.  If they had a cleric 
healing them you wouldn't see this benefit, since the cleric would use 
just the same amount of mana (or more mana if they were of CHeal level) 
to heal two halfs as he would for one whole.  Warriors could do this as 
well, but since they can only bandage up to 50% this lets them handle a 
lot more damage.

I still put it to you that the ranger/cleric team I mentioned comes out 
-way- ahead of your two warrior team, as does any competent pair that 
works well together, I suppose warrior is just a weak example of that 
same principle.

Lets see.  5 level 30s versus 5 level 30s and one level 20

5 level 30s: 180% exp divided 5 ways =  36% exp each
5 level 30s and a level 20: 216% exp divided up: level 30s get 3/17ths 
and level 20 gets 2/17ths: 38%, 38%, 38%, 38%, 38%, 25%

Hey, a case where the group members actually get more exp than they did 
without the mule, assuming the mule contributes nothing at all.

If that mule was level 30 like the rest then you'd have each member 
getting 1/6th 216% which is 36% same as the 5 way split, the 6th man is 
free but not actually benefitting the group unless he does at least a 
little work.

If though, you take a group of level 20s and add one level 30 as the 
"6th man" you get
216% exp divide up: level 20s get 2/13ths and level 30 gets 3/13ths: 
33%, 33%, 33%, 33%, 33%, 50%

So be cautious in assuming adding a 6th man is always free, despite the 
way they worded it in the patch message, he's only free if he's lower 
level than you, and really what you want is someone who will actively 
help the group by adding more exp coming in instead of just worrying 
about how the split will work.
