No he kept himself hanging by playing bidding games with another
buyer. He was a moron, because he expected her to wait knowing that
she had another buyer ready to make a deal. He must consider his time
valuable (otherwise he wouldn't have gotten angry). I think it's funny
that he doesn't see the value in making an offer that will seal the
deal in the least amount of time. The BoTH might have cost him a
little more than market value, but he could have spent the rest of
that hour making back the difference instead of playing bidding games.

She wanted to make the best deal. That is the fundamental difference.
Sellers market in this case.

Exactly. He could have made her a deal so good that she would take it
immediately, or offered the most he was willing to off and say "take
it or leave it". Instead he wanted to get the item for as little as
possible. Nothing wrong with that, but he took the risk and lost out
on the item.

I'm the same way. When I make an offer it is usually the most I'm
willing to pay. If there is another buyer offering more. I move on. I
don't play games. It's not the sellers fault if two interested buyers
want to engage in a bidding war.

100-140 people in the Bazaar last night durring PST prime time. I
would be willing to bet it is about the same % of the total player
count on the server as any other. FV is one of the least populated
servers. In general most items are very cheap. Lot's of sellers....few
buyers. The usual suspects still command top dollar (pp)...(Fungis,
etc)

True, but as I mentioned above, both buyers in this case chose to play
"Market Tycoon". When that happens someone is going to lose out, and
time will be wasted in the process. Both should have been prepared for
that eventuality.
