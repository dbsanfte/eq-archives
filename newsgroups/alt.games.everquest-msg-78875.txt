Nothing wrong with getting rich if you can. Personally, that isn't why I
play a druid. I just happen to LIKE the class, money or not. I expect I'd
still have her as my main, regardless. In fact, since she's only 18, she
sin't making much money these days. I guess that'll change when she gets her
ports, but as I said, that ain't why I play her. And she IS my main.
