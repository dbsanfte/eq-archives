No, they key is nothing to do with installing the game, running the
tutorial or anything like that. The key is simply used to activate and
manage the account for access to the server - as such all that is dealt
with remotely and becomes just another login verification system. When you
reinstall all you need to know if your station name and password to strt
the login again. If a mate of mine loses his CDs he can happily borrow
mine to reinstall, or use his statin name and password to play on my
machine till his CDs show up in a house tidy....
