>Too bad there are no kitty monks.

I was soooo looking forward to this new race because I heard somewhere (or just
assumed) that they would be monks.  And now their not.  It would've been cool
to have a a tiger kicking butt with only it's hands (paws, claws whatever) I
think the monk class should have more than two races...phooey.
