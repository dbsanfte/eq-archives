I know many arent keen on PLing (and i hope this doesnt turn into an
anti-PL thread), but for those that do, where are your best spots?

The ultimate spot for me, for low leves is Kurns Tower. OMG. The xp is
just obscene here - especially after the newbie xp boosts. I kid you
not, I can PL (being a 53 druid) a newbie from level 1 to level 15 in
just a few hours. Lots of reds here to a lowbie, and the nice part is,
none of the skellies run. Just thorn up your little wannabe and watch
the skellies impale themselves. Once you do one point, run to the next
and so on. Early on, youll ding every few kills.

After that, Unrest is usally pretty nice until around 20. In wolf form
(and being high enough level) you can pick and choose any target in
the house (well i havent pulled from the basement) and nothing else
will agro. WW is another nice spot.

CC is pretty fun after that and you can farm the blocks of Velium as
you do it. OT is good as well until about 30. Nurga/Droga is sweet xp
after 30, and hardly anyone hunts here. After this - it gets pretty
hard to PL.

Anyone else have any sweet spots?
