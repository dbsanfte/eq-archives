Remember what I said about many shamans not knowing how to heal?

You have to expect lots of bad groups in your teens. People are
learning how to play their characters, and the bad groupers are still
being weeded out. Also, you might be expected to just heal yourself...

Best thing is to work on your own grouping abilities and doubt
everyone else's till they've proven their worth.
