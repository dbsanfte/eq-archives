   I would vote no.  It seems to me that the newbie hunting zones are
pretty well kept at a good population by the use of instancing.  By the
time one gets into the teens when groupage, at least from what I can tell,
seems more common, one would have learned enough of the game mechanics to
no longer be a "noobie".

   Of course, alot of this answer depends on what your definition of
"noobie" and "swamped with battlehardened experienced players" is.  If you
are talking about economics, well then, yes, there will always be players
that know more than  you.  If you are speaking of levels, then yes, until
you hit the level cap yourself, there will always be players who are a
higher level than you.  If you are speaking of "just knowing how to play
the game-ness" then you might want to consider that all MMORPGs have had
players of relative skill.  So.  I don't think you'll have any problems
learning the game and getting through the starting levels because of
players who have started earlier, but if you are the jealous type then yes,
there will be people who can inspire that reaction in you.
