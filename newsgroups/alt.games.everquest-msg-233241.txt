Yeah, Martin's right, it was just an AE DD.  Manageable if you stay off the
wall.  Er, from a cleric perspective.

We brought down VZ last night on our third attempt.  I didn't feel like he
would be a problem, his melee is easily manageable, it's just the annoying
FD proc.  When we wiped the first time, I confidently stated in guildchat
that VZ would *not* be a roadblock and that we'd get him soon.  I was right.
I'm not always.  ("Ornate prices will go down if I just wait long enough.")

We got into Phase 5 and took down Cazic Thule (first time ever for me,
including Fear) and tried Rallos Zek.  We simply didn't have the numbers (by
then it was 1am) so we'll try again tonight.

It actually took us a long time to wipe on RZ.  =)  After five minutes and
our fifth MT, I was saying into guildchat, "Burn him down" to which I was
told, "Dude, he's at 70%."  That emphasized how much of our DPS had logged /
been killed by that time.  =)
