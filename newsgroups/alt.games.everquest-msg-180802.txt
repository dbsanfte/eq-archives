One of the rules of online game design...  Never trust the client.   The
client is in the hands of the enemy.

All characters are stored on Sony's servers.  You cannot make a local
backup.

The best you can do is to force a save by handing money or an item to
another player.  To prevent duping in crashes, the game is set to backup
your character immediately every time that happens.
