On Sat, 09 Nov 2002 18:07:32 GMT, >Rotclaw< <nospam@nospam.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

That is true.

>Midgard's warriors? 

Because there is no such thing as balance in DAoC and many of the
descriptions are misleading.

The strength of midgard is... actually, they have no strength. This is
why they are losing badly on most servers.


> Makes no sense to me.

Welcome to DAoC.

You would think.

You have learned the first lesson of DAoC - the descriptions of the
realms have nothing to do with reality.

Yeah, well, I don't think Mythic really knows where they are going.

Interesting idea.

Hope that gives you a few pointers on how things work in Mythicworld.

Oh, one further thing... this is alt.games.everquest. 

But since I did virtually the same thing a few weeks ago, I understand
how it can happen. :-)
