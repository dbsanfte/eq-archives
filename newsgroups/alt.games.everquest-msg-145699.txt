Four of them, not ten. And it doesn't seem to be clear yet whether or
not they will be ground spawns, random drops, or drops off specific
mobs, nor how rare the drops will be.

In any event, it's far from just "farming" in terms of farming greens
for tradeskill crap. Most of the mobs will give (some) xp all the way to
level sixty. You can at least get an xp grind group going and have fun
hunting with your friends while seeking the drops, if they are mob
dropped. Either way, it's a damned sight better than sitting for weeks
staring at an empty patch of stoney ground slowly losing your mind.
