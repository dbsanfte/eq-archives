I believe it heals 1/4 of whatever your skill is.  If your skill is 20 that
would be 5hp per bandage.  Yeah, really sucky...I'd recommend making friends
with a mage (summon bandage) until you get your skill up higher.  Your max
skill is  (level+1)*5.  At level 11 that'd mean (11+1)*5 which means 12*5 =
60.  So each bandage would be 60/4 = 15hp each, if your skill was maxed.
