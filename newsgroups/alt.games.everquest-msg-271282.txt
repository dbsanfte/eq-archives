Because people are continually leaving EQ1.
I has this same problem about 4 months ago and paid for a server transfer.
Was great for about 2 months, then people started leaving the new server and 
Im back to square 1.
Only several hundred dollars poorer.

An analogy would be leaving one sinking ship, for another sinking ship that 
hasnt quite sunk as much yet.

Would be a decent idea if it cost 50 bucks or so, but were talking a very 
large sum of money to transfer servers.
I guess it depends on how rich you are. I guess if you can aford 50k to 
clone a cat, then a few hundred for a transfer isnt that bad.
