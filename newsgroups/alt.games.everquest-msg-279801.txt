Just remember that there are some dangers.  With any multiquest, it is
possible that the person doing the MQ (the one with the item but no
need for it) can actually receive the reward.  This isn't much danger
with something like the SEoC multiquest, but I have seen it happen to
someone handing in guts for the Amulet of the Grey Wastes quest and the
wrong person got the reward.  This happened because someone else had
already handed in an item, so the NPC was already at 1/3 or 2/3 needed
items.

Also remember that some NPCs require faction for the quest, and will
not accept an item from the multiquester in some cases.  Sony has
fooled around with faction requirements over the years so on older
quests it may be impossible to know for certain.  You are pretty safe
if you do some research on Allakhazam to see what faction requirements
there may be.  But in the end, caveat emptor.
