Ah.  Okay, when you asked about "commands" I thought you meant for
putting in hotkeys.  Sounds like you're more wondering what sorts
of actions you can attach to single keystrokes.

You can find that list by opening the Options window and going to
the Keys tab.  Select Category: All, and you'll get a long list of
things, and for each of them you can specify up to two keys (or
shift/ctrl/alt + keys) to invoke those actions.  If you try to use
a key that's already being used for something else, sometimes it'll
do both, but it might only do one of the effects.  (People sometimes
set up the left-arrow key as an alternate for invoking a hotbutton,
as a way to train up foraging or tracking or whatever.)

You can, of course, make a hotkey that opens a bag.  Hold down the
left button on the bag to get a hotkey, then drop it in your hotkey
window.  I tried setting up the same keypress to do both "toggle
inventory window" and "hot button 2" to see if I could do what you
described (single key to open inventory and a bag), but it didn't
work.

Note that, earlier this year, they added a way to have a single key
open ALL your bags (and another key to close them all).  That one
DOES work if you use the same key for it as for your inventory.  If
you don't want to open your bags every time, you can use "I" to open
the inventory normally, and have "ctl z" be the alternate key for
both the inventory and opening all the bags.

Hope this helps!
