While this is the conventional approach, you'll also see
the channels used for raid communication.

A raid being any activity undertaken by more than one
group, a line of communication for the raid is needed.
If everyone in the raid is in the same guild, then that
channel is often used, but when this isn't the case,
one of the three channels you name is nominated,
if not two.

A general approach is
OOC general chatter
SHOUT incoming, deaths, emergency heal requests, leader instructions

However, some zones will draw more than one raid at a time (I've seen
this most in Kael Drakkar for some reason) and then the general
plan is to split up the channels

Usual approach is for one raid to us OOC and the other SHOUT,
but an approach I liked better was for the channels OOC and AUCTION,
so that SHOUT could be used for communication between raids

I've also seen three raids in one zone, each using one of the three
channels.

The trick with these approaches is to go into your options chat filter,
and filter out the channel you aren't using, and into your chat box...
(hmm, can't think what this is called, but right click on your chat text)
and set your default channel to OOC or whatever "your" raid channel
is.

Its important to keep up a line of chatter in that channel, so that the
non-guildies in your raid aren't out of the loop and are having fun, I've
been on a few raids where things were deathly silent except for
the business at hand, and often even that wasn't announced... Its
possible that the guild hosting the raid was just really quiet, but
much more likely they were chattering away in GUILD

A couple times I've been in newbie zones where a raid was taking
place, and the newbs get very upset at having their OOC channel
swiped.  No, they can't keep it in GUILD... there's more than one
group.  No, they can't keep it in GUILD, there's more than one
guild.  No, they can't keep it in SAY, they are too spread out for
that to work.
