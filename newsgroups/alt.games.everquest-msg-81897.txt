Othern than to say "I feel for ya", none. That boat has been the bane of my
existence in EQ, but I have always quietly put up with it. I think it's
gotten a little flakier lately though... certainly seems like it has. I've
never gotten off anywhere but bb or fp, but I expect the same damn thing
happens at either end. Wish I could help.
