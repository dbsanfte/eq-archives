You don't get it, do you?

NOTHING JUSTIFIES TERRORISM...

NOTHING JUSTIFIES THE SPECIFIC TARGETING FOR MURDER OF INNOCENT WOMEN
AND CHILDREN...

Why specifically target and murder a mother and her three children in
their home??

If the Israeli military is the problem, then go after the Israeli
military.

It's the same issue as if some psycho American Indian came into your
house and slaughtered your family, because of what the US Military did
100 years ago..  

It makes just as much sense.

You may think you know what goes on there, due to your reading of very
biased websites..

Go to the area. Then come back here and try to justify terrorism as a
legitimate response..
