Hi,

a few months a go, I received an email telling me I was getting 7 free days
trial to come back to EQ.

Yesterday for fun, I patched EQ and tried to log. Surprise, I got in and was
able to play all night long.

how come I didnt received an email telling me I got free trials  again ??

Maybe everyone got these free trial days ?

Anyone else noticed this ?

later
