  Chalk it up as a loss in my opinion. You still may be patient and you
might get your money. They might have really went ld and just not got back
yet. We had something sorta the same happen couple weeks ago, my wife was
ML'r and she forgot one whole backpack of stuff on her she didn't sell. She
was still tracking people down a week later trying to give them the money.
=)   Give it a little more time, if you don't get it just try and pass the
word around about this person being a loothog.

  Good luck and sorry about your loss.
