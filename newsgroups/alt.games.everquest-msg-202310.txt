2-3K is about the going rate for 21% haste items (eq FBSS, SCHW, etc)
on most servers. Some servers will have higher, and some will have
lower prices. Your best bet is to check the bazaar every time you play
and to get a feel for the average prices on your server.

Also at 38 you could get into a Frenzy group in LGuk and get your own
FBSS.  Then sell it to make pp towards a haste item with better AC.
