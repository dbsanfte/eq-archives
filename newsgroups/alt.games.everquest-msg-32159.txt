    I assume you mean the reference.

    The Magna Carta is a document which was delived by King John in 1215,
basically decreeing that not even the King of England was above the law.
Or, more acurately, is held accountable to law.

    Since I did explain the idea more fully in a different post, I will only
point out the reference here, for folks who might not have known what the
Magna Carta is.
