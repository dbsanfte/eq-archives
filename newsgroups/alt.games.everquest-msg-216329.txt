Only collection quests I've ever failed have been due to problems with
the group... Some idiot running ahead of the puller and training us,
poking at a chest, or some other stupid crap and causing a wipe. Well,
okay, once was because 2 of the group members went LD for a good 15
minutes (Tragically, one was myself. Comcast burped locally...). The
group plugged ahead as best they could, and we did get within 2 of our
goal, but ultimately failed.
