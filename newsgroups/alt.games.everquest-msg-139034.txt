It's all the different exceptions that a lot of my exGF's (from various
Asian countries) find difficult to digest. They are used to certain rules
which hold true but upon spending so long learning the rules the exceptions
still trip them up.

My sweetest spot was for a Taiwanese GF I had who had a degree in mechanical
engineering was further studying tertiary opera singing. She knew Mandarin,
Cantonese, Taiwanese (different from mandarin BTW), Japanese, English,
French, German and Italian. When she asked me how many languages I knew and
could only answer "English" I realised exactly how linguistically ignorant I
was.

Grammer wise, my mother is learning Sanskrit at the moment, and she tried to
explain to me the basics of the grammer rules..... I never had a headache
hit me so quick before in my life ; )
