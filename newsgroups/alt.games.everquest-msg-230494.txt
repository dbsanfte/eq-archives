I had a new low record on Wednesday evening. My group had just died, and 
I, a 61 necro, was in POK waiting for a decision for a rez or should I 
head back to the group first. Some idiot named Datto sent me a tell 
demanding I twitch him. He was quite uppity about it too.

What part of "naked necro" says "twitch bitch"?? The fuckwad really 
pissed me off- and no, I don't care that if I was getting a rez and that 
would eliminate all of my mana. His uppity statement arrived while I was 
halfway back to the camp on the run.
