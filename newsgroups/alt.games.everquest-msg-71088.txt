First off, I'm glad *you* got the joke and saw I wasn't accusing you of
dickwaving as so many others here seemed to have. And your words do give
me some hope. A friend of mine with a warlord in a more serious guild
(Harmonium) recently told me that our guild was obviously in, what they
called, "that awkward stage". That is, finally getting enough people in
the same guild, online at the same time, and able to mount up four
groups of primarily 50+ or better, but still not sure exactly what to do
with all this firepower now that you've gotten it out of the box and
assembled. I guess I should have taken this as a positive thing, since
he was also saying we were "over the hump" and had a chance of getting
out of that perpetual churn, never go to the next level stage that so
many guilds just flounder around in until they collapse. But I'll tell
ya, the tactics and (as you point out) organizational requirements can
be daunting at first.

Well, we're not exactly doing Velketor yet, but it's not out of the
question if we get better organized.

Ah, but I disagree. The knowledge that you guys bought and paid for with
your own blood is now "common knowledge" to you, but it would certainly
still be a hidden secret or elite tactic for us. That is... until, as
you say, "it clicks".

That, along with ensuring that the incredibly differing personalities of
a few dozen people who play hardcore enough to break 51 don't suddenly
come into conflict and cause intercine warfare. :-)
Thank gawd I'm not an officer in my new guild, so others are left to
deal with those issues and I just bash stuff.
