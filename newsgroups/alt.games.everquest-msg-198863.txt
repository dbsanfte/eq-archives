Is there any chance I could get a look at your website? I am the
webmaster for our guild and we kinda sorta have a loot point system,
but I haven't implemented any means of tracking / administering. I
would be curious to know what other guilds have done on the technical
side. If you don't wanna post a url, you can send me email directly at
the address above...

thanks.
