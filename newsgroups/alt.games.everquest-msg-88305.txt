Heya,

Now up to 18 with my monk (my first melee- my other characters are a 30 
druid and a 19 chanter) I am starting to feel the math obsession...

Does anyone know a good site that has formulas, etc, for choosing damage 
and delay, calculating strength bonuses, Monk AGI -> AC bonuses, the merits 
of stamina for hit point totals, etc?

Jazz?
