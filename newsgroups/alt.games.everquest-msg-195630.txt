I played in beta 4, started retail a week or two after release. My recollection
is halfling exp bonus was given because nobody was playing halflings.

(tangent)

Bear in mind, the racial XP penalties are unchanged since release... When
I first started infravision was a big deal, damage output was so weak slam
could be significant, +stat items were astonishingly rare and hard to get
and generally added (a few) points instead of (a few hundred).

A ranger suffering 40% xp penalties (halflings couldnt be rangers) was
not out of line when they tanked as well as warriors, hit as hard, got
spells, had armour roughly as good with a nasty spartan patch between
banded and rubicite and could see in the dark as well.

The game has changed, things have been balanced out more... but the penalties
for race remain even if classes have gone... and the racial advantages are
far less important. Damage done by weapons has hugely increased, that
by slam hasnt. Damage done by mobs and hp totals have skyrocketed, regen
hasn't. Gamma has been introduced and even without it the 'night time'
dark has been hugely mitigated... etc.
