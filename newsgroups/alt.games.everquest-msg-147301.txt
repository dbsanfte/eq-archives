IS there actualy a bonus for having a full group, or is it just that you can
take down more/ bigger mob's?   I have read that they give you a bonus for
groups over 4, something like the dungen modifier. But i don't realy see it.
Then again I tend to be one of the lowest people in the group, sometimes
getting droped because the leader dings and i'm not 2/3 any more.  seem's
that a group should level at the same speed.(point for point, not % to %)

Thanks

Omiin
