From personal former experience (I no longer play) sometimes mouse targeting
is very tricky when multiple targets are close together. Most people prefer
'target nearest' and/or assist on main tank instead. I imagine the pointer
is whatever you are most comfortable with. I know someone that plays these
games with a little micro stick like some of the laptops have for a pointing
device. I can barely use one of those in windows proper...

I would think if I were more used to it a trackball, especially a palm ball,
would offer me more control and 'agility'.
