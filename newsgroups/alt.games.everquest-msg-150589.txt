Thanks for pointing out the mistake.  I did some playing around & see that
the formula appears to be:

IF INT <= 200 THEN
Mana = (LV*2) + (LV*INT/5)

IF INT > 200 THEN
Mana = (LV*42) + ((INT-200)*5.8)

This proves that past 200, INT doesn't do much for you regardless of LV.  A
LV1 is going to benefit the same as far as mana increase as a LV60 from the
same INT increase (assuming they both have 200 INT already & are being given
the same +INT item).  However, because a LV1 is going to have that mana last
allot longer, it would be better for them to have the extra INT than the
LV60 (if you were giving either of the two an item based on who could
benefit the most out of it).

So assuming the maximum is LV60 with 250 INT, their mana would be 2810
total.
