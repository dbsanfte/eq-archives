You need to run to the dragon portal in GD first to pick up the tooth there.
You and every member in your "porting group" must have that tooth or they
simply aren't ported.

The place is a bit more safe then IC, but the occasional Young Shardwurm
tends to walk by anyway (green at lvl 45 or so).

There are 2 other keys, WL and .. CS? Not sure where they are for I do not
have them yet :)
The trick is that once you have the WL key you can go to GD as well as WL
with that one (no need for the GD tooth anymore) and when you get the third
(CS?) you don't need the other 2 anymore.

The WL one is terrifying at best. It is located within aggro range of a
dragon which spawns 24 hours after the zone is up.

I normally use the GD one since I have ally faction with the dwarves and
tend to bind in Thurgadin.
