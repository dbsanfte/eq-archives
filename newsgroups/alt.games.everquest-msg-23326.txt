And therein lies your problem.  Being an American myself, I would never
admit it. (Oops, just did.  See we're all blathering morons.)  You should
have entered Canadian --.  That would have made you something between
British +- and French ?? without the caps lock problem or the boot stuck up
your rear.  You would have had a few "eh" problems to contend with as well
as pronouncing about "aboot", though.
