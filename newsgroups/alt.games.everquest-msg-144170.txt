Can you drop me an email, or give me your character names to look for again.
I think we are just doing one rogue epic this time around, but I'll have to
double check on that too.  We have a tough time with the pulls, but we think
we have it worked out now, so I won't guarantee anything being left standing

contrary, a level 60 ranger cannot harmony pull singles.
