new shoes. the one i have would be far better for you since they have a +25
mana boost and an Agi boost
i cant remember what there called now but will let you know with a post.
since you int is maxed you can boost your mana with things that boost mana
directly. they cost me 300pp which is a way cheap price and all they guy who
sold them to would say is that there from Veilous and he was in deseprite
need of pp. it was on the first day after you could buy Tboots.
