Sure but that's not entirely Sony's fault. Log in at 9:00pm PST and do a 
who all 28. I got 4 hits yesterday (actually i did a who all 27)... 2 
are in the bazaar afk, 1 is in OT, and 1 is in CoM or something with a 
55th level druid power leveling himself.

Who exactly should he group with? And should he be made to sit on his 
ass until the next day? Because after 9pm PST the server population goes 
down not up.

The game originally got its "legs" with a server population that was 
progressing from the low to then maximum 50th level. At 28th you were 
entering the mid-game and had likely dozens of people to play with. A 
who all 28 would result in a dozen hits, only 1 of which were being 
powerlevelled, none in the bazaar afk, and sure a couple would be 
soloing but very likely willing to group.

Its not the same game anymore. You can't pretend it is. It took the 
early players 5 years to get where they are today. Even if you could 
stop powerlevelling you can't expect a new player to wait 5 years to 
catch up to his friends. And even if you could it would be a long lonely 
journey because when the earlier players did it they had company... 
there are comparatively few people making that first journey to 65th 
today. I agree that sony has dumbed it down in ways that make new 
players incompetent when they get to 65th... but increased regen isn't 
one of them. PC and other easy high ZEM zones are far worse.
