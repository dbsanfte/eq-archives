Having both a magician AND a shaman at 52, I couldn't disagree more with 
Faned's position, my only thought was that perhaps the higher level 
spells in the line change this mechanic utterly; Malaise, Malaisement 
and Malosi, at least, are all way down in the Cancel Magic area of aggro 
generation; in fact I pull with either depending on whether I care more 
about resists or potential buffs the target might have.  In either case, 
and for either class, I want my pet to get the mob off me on the way in, 
and frankly pet aggro is really not all that and a bag of chips.  A 
nuke, or a slow (depending on class) and that mob is going to go right 
thru my pet and chase me around the field for a few laps before the 
pet's "get it off me" skills finally kick in.  As a mage, this was 
extremely important for a long time, as I had no way of moving faster 
than the mob, and about the same HP total as a box of dry spaghetti; I 
really needed the mob to get over to my pull area and then concentrate 
on my pet.

But he had no better luck with this than my shaman, no worse, but no 
better, my conclusion is that his malaise is no less aggrivating than my 
shaman's.

My enchanter had a different MO, soloing, he wanted to be hit, only then 
would his pet "get it off me" anyway, unless he was charming.  I also 
got him only to 30.  I didn't really notice tash line being particularly 
worse than malaise line, but I can't argue the contention that it is.
