And in TFC? In TFC the HW guy will have more armor and life, bigger
guns, be slower and unable to conc jump. Yet he can be killed by a
skilled scout. I have been. The pyro is fast with confusing weapons
that are short range and low damage but blind and with a single long
range weapon capable of damage thru walls. Yet if he stands still a
sniper will blow his head off. 

You can't compare the individual classes in a realm and say it's
unequal, what you need to compare is the overall realms. Does each
realm have classes that can fulfill the required roles equally? If not
then theres an imbalance. 

Level based imbalances exist in level based games. most people
understand that before crossing into the frontier.
