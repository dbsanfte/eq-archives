Well for one thing your talking about relatively light hitting mobs compared
to the stuff in Tier3+ planes. Even so an additional 250 damage per fight is
an additional k per 4 which means that pretty quickly it adds up to
significant damage. Now of course if you have plenty of mana regen for your
healer its not really an issue save that the mana saved in healing can be
used for rebuffing and nuking.
The question has to be.. Does the additional damage gained by the faster
weapon offset the mana spent for heals and that could have been used for
delivering damage through other means.
From everything I've read the dps diff between a WMBS and  WB is marginal at
best a couple of %. Additionally when tanking things that hit significantly
harder than those mobs you mention from your parses the equation moves
again.

And if you got 12 rips with a WMBS then you would probably have gotten more
like 8 or so using the slower Windblade. And its not just "stupidity" that
can cause such a circumstance. Lag can easily cause significant enrage
damage not because you weren't on the ball but becuase you got a touch of
lag and you got the enrage message a second or so after it actually kicked
off.

I do agree with your last point. And if you expect to be primarily a damage
dealer then the dps advantage of the WMBS would make it the superior choice.
However if you expect to use it as mainly a tanking weapon the blade eaks
out ahead for tanking purposes.
(I use one for my ranger because when I'm about doing damage I'm usually
bowing so it really doesn't matter what weapons I'm weilding but for those
times that I have to take a few hits the WB does respectable damage as well
as making me less of a mana sponge)
