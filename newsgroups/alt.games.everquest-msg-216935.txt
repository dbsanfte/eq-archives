you sound like you posted to the wrong group.....we all get to play on
dedicated servers [clusters] for 13 bucks a month =P

you sound also like someone trying to sell a server for a counterstrike / ut
/ dod whatever.....and for that reason, i have to tell you that 100 bucks a
month is a terrible cost....friend of mine has a server for 5 bucks...i know
a guy who got a sponser and pays nothing
