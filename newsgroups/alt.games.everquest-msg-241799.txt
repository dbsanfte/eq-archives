I actually think it adds some flavor to the game, knowing that you need 
to beware a rising of undead come sundown. I just think that making it a 
steady stream lasting the entire night is a bad idea. It's silly to force 
low level players into the city for the night. They should make the 
spawnings fewer and farther between so that you could still play, just 
with a heightened sense of danger at night.
