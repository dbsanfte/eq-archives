One my server, one guild had a fear raid.  They made heavy use of AoE
tactics, and killed a lot of stuff on the break-in in a very short
time.  Later, another guild was going up.  They had someone who went
in, who verified that the entrance was still clear from the last raid.
Everyone got ready, and zoned in (they were using the "everyone zones
in at once" break in technique).  Well, in between veryifying that it
was totally clear, and their zoning in...everything had repoped.

From there, things went downhill.  They were a good guild, with many
experienced Fear people...but you know how on a raid even an
experienced person occasionally makes a mistake?  Usually, that's not
too bad...but they got a bad run, and experienced people made every
mistake in the book over the next couple of hours.  From what I hear,
they spent most of a day working on various corpse recoveries.
