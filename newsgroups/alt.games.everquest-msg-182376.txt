Given the choice, would you prefer to play in a game where:
A) You have zones that hardly ever change. Take EC as an example, the orc
camps always have the name number of MOB, the orc smith always spawns at a
particular camp, etc.

B) Zones where the spawn tables are routinely modified as a side effect of
patches. Before the patch, camp 1 has 3 orcs. After the patch, camp 1 has 2
level 15 undead, and the hidden inn is now run by dark elves, etc.

C) Zones where the spawn tables are routinely modified as a side effect of
player actions. Kill the rangers and more rabid animals start to spawn, kill
Lord Shin Ree and the orcs stop spawning (and are replaced by human
"settler" spawns), etc.

D) Zones where the MOBs periodically mix it up. Every so often the undead at
the haunted ruins attack the guards at inn 2 and -- if the guards are
killed -- take over the site & force the merchants to relocate to the empty
hut (where they gather the guard to retake inn 2), etc.

For options B-D, would you prefer to limit the changes to things that are
fairly limited in nature or allow dramatic changes (e.g. sometimes EC will
have dark elf guards and merchants -- but, by the same token, sometimes the
halflings will colonize Nektulos forest)? The scope of the change can, of
course, depend on the zone (EC and Nektulos might see only minor changes but
the halfling might take control of Kithicor and the gnolls might occupy the
Aviak village in SK).
