That's why it's a 'Moose Head on the Wall'

The stats are something like (bane/focus from memory):

Sword of Truth
MAGIC LORE NO DROP
Skill: 1h slashing  Atk Delay: 45
DMG: 75  AC:100
Bane Damage: +25 cold
Bane Damage: +50 humanoid
Effect: +100% 1hs
STR: +50 DEX: +50 STA: +50 CHA: +50
WIS: +50 INT: +50 AGI: +50 HP: +50
MANA: +100 SV FIRE: +50 SV DISEASE: +50 SV COLD: +50
SV MAGIC: +50 SV POISON: +50
WT: 0.1  Size: Large
Class: NONE
Race: NONE



None/None means it's not equippable. Heard urban folklaw about someone
equipping it during the UI exploit period and getting suspended though
hehe. If it *DID* work, I'd be soloing in Qeynos with a 150dam 45delay
1hander hehe

Heh, our closest competition (never killed blood/emp/cursed/seru/etc)
did the same to us when we left Seru and headed for cursed. Their 15
people in the zone suddenly developed an overwealming need to kill a
taskmaster for a bag. Go figure.

Were you there? LOL

That was almost EXACTLY the text from the chat room (despite there being
a GM_SWAT in there), and given the fact that there were already 6 help
channels in chat, I figured petitioning on a different account would be
pointless.

Logged back in today, still alive in Ssra basement, under a bub hps,
doted slightly, and in the middle of the arch. Ran for cover JUST as a
wandering taskmaster came by. That's why I carry 3-4 bags of just around
with me LOL! Click dain ring and bagged aob shoulders. Throw on bagged
fungi. Pull out bagged bandage summoner and summon a stack. Pull out
insiv legs and invis. Bandage up before running out to safety hehe.

Oh god, I hope not.

Been fighting a long battle to NEVER have the guild do doze quests. The
items are certainly endgame, and the bracer I'd kill for, but the time
involved and 'staggered' nature of the awards just leaves far too many
headaches to deal with in a DKP guild. I don't wanna be stuck there for
6 months farming rare_drop_quest_junk07 just because someone paid 5dkp
for one of the other pieces and wants his item he paid for.

If ST's like that with quests, I don't wanna know!

Zlex was the toughest (dis AE), followed by Vyemm (pre-root nerf). I'm
not saying they should be able to breeze in there and clear the place,
but from what you're saying it's pitched about right. Can clear most of
it, but have a few touch-and-go battles to test your metel at the end.

One thing I gotta ask, does CoH work there? How about SC in the depths?
