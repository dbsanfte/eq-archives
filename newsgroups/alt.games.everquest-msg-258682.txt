There's also the matter of selecting the right tool for the job. I was
involved in a project to try to switch a Canada wide ISP's user database
to Oracle from C-Base, and without some serious trickery, Oracle is very
expensive from a set up time perspective to set up and tear down
connections to for queries. This was a database that had to validate
users logging in and track their connection times and the programming
team working on it never did get it to work reliably with the thousands
of connections per minute that ISP had running, as it was back in the
days of pay per hour ISP billing so users logged in, grabbed their email
and logged right back out. The time to set up a connection to query an
oracle database is rather long, which explains many of the problems SWG
had on launch. A solution that was proposed but never implemented before
the project was scrubbed at the ISP I was contracted to was to write an
intermediary daemon that would hold open query connections to oracle and
accept query connections itself from the dial up software. It would be
optimized to be able to accept and drop queries a lot faster than oracle
was capable of.
