well, if you just want to explore i would suggest that you go from luclin to
north karana via the nexus and then just start wondering around there (i am
not saying it is safe at all)

As far as the pictures are concerned, they go in your default eq folder (i.e
C:\program files\everquest\eq0000001.bmp)
