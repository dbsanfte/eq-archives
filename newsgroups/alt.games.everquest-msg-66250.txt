Ok.  So, they shouldn't give those people who tough it out to the
higher levels perks for getting there?

My main is a 51 Druid, I also have a 22 Ranger, 20 Enchanter, and a
level 5 Mage, and a level 8 Wizard.  I also have a level 30 Warrior, a
level 13 rogue, and a brand new level 2 Vah Shir Beastmaster.

Because your newer characters haven't matured enough to get the
ability.

So, start another caster.  It's not that big a deal.

Exactly, which is why you can still use all the nifty chat functions.
At low levels, your character is suppose to have to concentrate so
intently on meditating that he shuts out all of the outside world.
Staring at the spellbook is just how the game displays that.  As your
character matures and become more adept, he can calm his mind and
reach a meditative state easier, thusly he doesn't have to shut out
all other forms of sensory input.

And really, why is staring at a static spellbook any worse than
staring at a static landscape?

I really hate mediating with my druid.  At 51, to med up from empty to
full takes the better part of 10 minutes if I don't have a bard or
enchanter to help me out.  I however, understand that it's one of the
limitations of casting classes.  It would be nice if casters just got
unlimited mana, but that's just not the way it works.  So I cope.
Medding takes a while so I either chat with my friends or I pull out a
book or magazine.  Since my character is medding and not me, I can do
that.
