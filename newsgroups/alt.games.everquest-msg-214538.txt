Easier yes, but that doesn't mean people are going to be interested in going
with non DPS oriented groups if they have to push thru fast.

If you ever go on the Executioner trial (which is what most people, including
me, mean when they say POJ Trials), the answer to your dilemna would be to blow
all your mana on the pre boss mobs.  They have to die in under 30 seconds each,
4 in a row, rest a minute, 4 more, 4 more, 4 more.  The boss mob, you have lots
of time to deal with, and as long as someone survives who can rez you, everyone
else is expendible, I've never seen him nuked to death, but even that would be
possible, I have seen him kited around and around till I got enough mana
together to CHeal the warrior.  Kiting a summoner is not for the faint of heart,
of course...
