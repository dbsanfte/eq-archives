IMHO, I think it would be great if Verant would spring for an additional
staff of EM's "event masters" and hold events on a continueing basis.  They
don't need to be loot fest either, maybe advice to lowbies, Surprise mobs
spawning in strange places, unexpected rezzes "blessings from above",
unexpected heals and uber buffs, ...  All sorts of things.   They could
introduce Vox and Naggy code that would port anyone too high away if they
interfeared. You name it,  just to add spice to a static enviroment.  Let
them have a free hand and let them have fun.
