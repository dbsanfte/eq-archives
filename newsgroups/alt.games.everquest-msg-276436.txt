I tend to sell the loot off, but the quest rewards can be awesome. I have
done 4 characters to about 17, and there are some where you can solo all the
way, like dane's boots and the "restoring the balance" one (also the seafood
one in sq involving sea turles etc), and the catalog of outlying qeynos,
that give decent gear. Other quests, eg blackburrows, involve group mobs,
and i have soloed green and blue grp mobs with my warrior but my summoner
just seems to get wasted.

I've grouped a bit and the xp is faster, but so is the death rate and the
annoyance factor of group members falling off cliffs or just going afk for
extended periods (if someone's at the door, camp, it's 20 seconds of your
time!)

I've tried both and I couldn't say either game gets me over excited. EQ2 is
getting better but still has problems such as not being able to share
quests, so it's hard to get everyone interested in questing, and a lot of
mobs never seem to get touched, which is just wasted content. I wish there
was an xp bonus for killing a mob for the first time, and a law of
diminishing returns that would push people to try new areas.
