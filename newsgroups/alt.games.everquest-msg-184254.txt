When my Troll Beasty first started out he was my first toon on AB so had
nothing but his newbie knife and a few bits of netted he pinched off the
froggies, as he leveled into the early teens he was able to buy more and
more stuff, then into the late 20 he discovered Leather padding, and the
stupid money people will pay for it.

So once again his equipment got a major upgrade, but what to do with all the
old gear ? well none of it was fantastic, but it was too good to destroy, I
considered selling off in the bazaar but figured I would only get 300-400pp
if I was lucky, so I wandered off to shadeweaver and sat in the fire
watching the young'uns (its amazing how easy it is for a troll to walk into
a pile of burning twigs and hide) I spotted with one young beasty charging
out of sharval, zooming towards the closest mob, dropping dead, then
starting all over again.

While most the other Cats where running around in full sets of armour or
with big shiny weapons trying to level as fast as possible so they could
leave, this one cat (lets call him Timmy) seemed to be having a fantastic
time of it totally naked littering the landscape with his body.

So I call Timmy over to see me, and he runs away, it seems hes never seen a
Troll before and he thought I was trying to kill him =)

So after I finally convince him i'm a PC and unable to kill him he comes
back over to me, we chat away and it turns out this is his first ever day on
EQ (Yes real Newbies still exsist they are just rare) I hand over the gear
and hes totally flabber-ghasted, Most the armour gave him a chain look
which was a big diffrence from his pants and tunic, and his weapon has STATS
! he was totally blown away by this, and thought I was some kind of god =)

Needless to say hunting for him was alot easier, and I even hung about a bit
and showed him around, and helped him get his first pet.

And that I thought was the last I would hear of him, I added him to my
friends list just in case he ever needed me, but thought he would foget my
name after a few days.
A week or so ago I got a /tell from a level 51 primalist asking If I wanted
a bit of Powerleveling , thats odd I thought, I dont know any high lvl
beasty on AB ... Guess who it was ?

It turns out Timmy had'nt forgot me after all, I still keep in contact with
him now, oh and he too gave the gear away, I like to think its still being
given away somewhere =)
