They're not bugged.   It's just that the number of drops placed randomly on
the mobs in the dungeon is directly related to the number you are required
to collect.  If you are asked to collect under 25, they can be very rare
drops.    You might get lucky and get them at the same drop rate as a
collect 30 mission... but the chances of pure dumb luck making you go 15
minutes without seeing any drop at all are much higher.

I've had collections where the drop rate alone was the determining factor
that caused us to lose.

Uh, but it does.  Almost every pickup group I join begins with someone
announcing that all they want is a slaughter.   Usually it takes about 15
minutes of sitting there waiting before the group gets fed up and outvotes
them, and we end up on a collection or assassinate mission.
