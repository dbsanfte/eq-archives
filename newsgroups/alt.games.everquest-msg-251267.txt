Pretty sure I read that they rot into the graveyard zone after a week
of in game time, which is when the corpses would normally rot and
disappear.  The Graveyard zone is supposed to be for those who have
died, can't get to their corpse before they need to log, and are going
to be away for ungodly amounts of time.  Correct me if I'm wrong!
