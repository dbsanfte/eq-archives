OK, a little more information now.  I installed the latest NVidia drivers,
keeping Dx7.  Works exactly the same as the older driver.  No problems
zoning.  I talked to a friend who had a similar problem at one time, and he
had called VI tech support, who told him to get an older version of the
video drivers, he didn't have the specific version number, rather than the
latest, and that works for him with DX8.  I have the latest VIA drivers
already, I am not using a 3com NIC.  I think that I'll leave well enough
alone for now, and deal with the issue of DX8 when Luclin comes out.
