Shaman can only buy the majority of their spells from their home town.
You can go to Grobb or Ogguk to buy your spells. You can also buy spells
from the Gypsy in Oasis- she will sell to ALL shaman (with the possible
exception of iksar). Your DoTs can only be purchased from Stragak, a
troll in Innothule Swamp.

So resign yourself to going "home" every five levels or so.
