Heh. In The Grey yesterday, Nec, Dru, Rng.

Level 53, 60, 56.

I, as the ranger, made 57. It was insane. Run out to graveyard. Pull
seven iksar slaves. Hurtle forwards in wolf form to get distance,
turn, snare leading one, hurtle forwards, turn, snare, etc. Once all
snared scoot back to base. Nec charms one out of the pile. Dru and
I rapidly rootpark the remainder; takes about 20 seconds at most.

Necro slows whats parked and fears what I'm meeleing and sends in
charmed pet. Druid plays healer and "Ooops, I AE'd the rooted
cluster" when she gets bored.

Lots, and lots, and lots of xp. XP *slowed down* when an enchanter
and cleric later joined as as everyone slipped into "traditional"
roles.

P.S. Moktors is pretty. All rangers should be allowed to wear
shiny plate for ever and ever ;)
