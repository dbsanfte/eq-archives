mule, and it was gone before I could log the mule in.)

	You can get a Centi SS for 50 pp?  (Given to Rogues and Rangers, at

	Assuming that was the criteria, which I doubt very much.  If it was, it's
a stupid criteria, for this very reason.

	More likely that the kits were done by different people with no real
baseline criteria and no real review process, kind of like many things in EQ.

|consumables were included.

	No, it wouldn't have to be; newbies executing /testbuff already have
issued food and drink, and established characters below 25 using it will have
bought their own long ago.
