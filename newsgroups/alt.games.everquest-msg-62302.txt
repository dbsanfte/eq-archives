On half the dell computers I buy the video cards are not integrated.  I
mostly buy the Dimension L (discon), 2100, 4100 (discon) and 4300.  Just an
FYI.

As to integration in general, I don't mind the sound...all my home-builts
could be disabled without a problem...haven't tried at work yet.  Don't want
video integrated at home. :p

But I was thrilled when they got rid of the need for an I/O card. <g>  That
made my whole life a hell of a lot easier.
