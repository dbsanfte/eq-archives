Yep, got ya and it sucks.

Their problem is though they'd have no way to screen for "real
emergencies" or not being able to access your account. They'd have to
at least take thousands of calls before saying "sorry I can't help on
this issue, petition in game if 3 other level 10 players are hogging
the orc camp in east commons."

Hunh? I don't get what you are saying about the /surname problem.
"being normal names" doesn't allow you to use the /surname command????
