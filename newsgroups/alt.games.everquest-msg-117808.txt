I don't think that UO using Avatar before EQ stops it from being a very 
valid term... Everybody uses MOB, which originated on text MUDs or even 
earlier. The only problem I have with Avatar is that it seems to befit 
Firiona Vie and the other "one character" servers than the average, mule-
ridden server. It sounds too serious for anything other than a main 
character, let alone an EC mule or Hole-diving lvl 1 Erudite Cleric of CT.
