    Heh, add another method to the "Dain down the hole" pull. I do not know
the exact method how we pull him, but this is what I see from camp: after a
fairly long time of being told "Dain is coming soon", "We think we have him
now", and "Who is Grizznot" we'll see a lone monk running towards the pin
spot from down the tunnel that leads to Grizznot (not in the direction of
the well). Dain will be chasing that monk. That sounds different from the
other three methods presented here.
