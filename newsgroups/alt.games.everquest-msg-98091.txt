Yeah and now it seems like you can add Planes of Power to the list.  Plus as
I said before they have all the other Planes to themselves, theres an idea
make a few Planes for low-mid lvls only, have wepaons, armor and spells drop
thats only for those lvls.  Add in new mobs and a main mob guy (not a god)
in there just like in the Planes we have now?
