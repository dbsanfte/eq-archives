The big problem would be the regular players having an issue with the
massive training.  True, Crushbone is known for trains.  As each of
your level one toons die, they will be attracting the mobs to your
other level one toons.  Eventually a large number of mobs will be by
the zone in pouncing on your newbiws (and anyone else there for EXP)
as they zone in.  More than just annoying for players who need to do
CR or have begun to lose EXP from a death.

As for getting the melees there -- you plan to bind them at the
Crushbone zone right?  Have the magician/shaman/whatever that will
bind them invis them over for the trip to the zone line.
