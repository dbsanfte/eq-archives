I downloaded EQW one time and successfully managed to have 2 characters from
different accounts in the Xev Bazaar of old. Needless to say it was a
slideshow...

Only useful for transferring items, even then with all the fussing needed it
is easier just to drop off and pick up unless it's coin which can't be done
that way anymore. These days even my "adequate" setup* can literally crash
with one instance of EQ running if I zone into the bazaar and run straight
for the vendor scrums next to the banks. BTW - can anyone figure why the
hell they do that? A whole zone to work in and with a tracking function that
makes everyone a breeze to find. Yet they insist on standing on top of each
other so as to give everyones video card a hernia with so much work to do in
one screen?



"Adequate Setup"*

AMD Thunderbird 1.2Ghz
768mb pc133MB
Geforce 3 Ti 200 64mb
SB Audigy.

It was pretty decent when made - getting a little long in the tooth now.
Surgery times a 'proaching.
