Trueshot does make a difference (well, 265 DPS sustained mana free,
aggro free damage over 2 minutes on a red conning Dragon is hardly
balanced otherwise) but his damage output with Archery is high enough
that he only uses melee now when he has to proc a slow or something.

Also, it's really not *that* many points, I've not counted but I'm
pretty sure any Ranger with the third rank title (Hunter) has enough
for Archery Mastery 3 and Endless Quiver.  Unless he or she has pissed
away points on crap like Finishing Blow in of course.

If a mob is stuck in a wall the best you can do is ram yourself in the
same wall and hope for the best, if that's doesn't work then you have
to melee this is true, it's a hard coded bug in the engine so unlikely
to be fixed any time soon.

Line of sight isn't too much of a problem with large model mobs, Mage
pets seem to be the worst offenders for getting in the way.

[snip Rogue specific threads]

Ah yes I see, this is for Rogues only you realise?  They max backstab
much more often with Avatar so it won't have anywhere near that affect
on your (or my) melee DPS.  Having dex as near as 255 as possible
would help Archery criticals no end however.

For Rogues?  Pretty much every uber mob piercer in Luclin.  I'm not
keen on swapping weapons out personally but clearly for Avatar it's
worth it (six minutes until you have to do it again.)

Off the top of my head..

Mrylokar's Dagger of Vengeance
Tor Vignus
Vyemm's Fang
Tendonslicer
Bonechiller (offhand)
Claw of Lightning (offhand)

>From the same thread,  "You can't replace primal with anything."

For the proc, absolutely.  Once it's procced there are dozens of
better weapons available.  I mean - sheesh - if a primal two hander
was up for grabs I'd take it *just* for the proc even though I'd
always swap it out post proc.

Re: Your 200 DPS in Velks, any chance of finding your original timed
