You do realize that you see exactly the same things in both a 13" TV and
and 32" TV right? Duh. Which would you rather watch?

The point is that you are seeing them in more detail. 70% of the screen in
the windowed mode is useless. Just a bunch of big giant buttons with lots
of useless space in between, and at a lower resolution than can be had
by going to the full screen mode.
