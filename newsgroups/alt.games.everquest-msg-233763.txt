Tried that today.  Forgot that you can't have two packs.  Doh!  Still, 
farmed enough bits to make another two when I get the pouches - once I 
found where to farm the shadeling silks!

Fancied doing that, but the page I looked at said NOT soloable.  Must 
look further and see at what level it may become soloable.

Went to Santusc this morning, had a look round.  Very nice looking city, 
but not my sort of place.  (I like Ak'Anon which is still my favourite 
place.)  So I might just start hunting in Sanctus for the hell of it, it 
was certainly quiet :)
