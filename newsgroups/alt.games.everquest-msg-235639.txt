BTW: Yes, you're screwed. Don't turn in any more tribute for a week,
because IF they cap the hit at 0 (i.e. they don't allow you to go
negative) then any points you get this week might just get thrown out.

There it is again, and I'm just baffled. A guy like this who saved up
his skill-up results and bought some weapons to turn in IN GOOD FAITH
is getting screwed, and all you can think about is the obvious
abusers.

I guarantee you that there are 20 guys like the above and like me for
every single bait-sploiter. Why are the latter the only ones people
want to talk about?

How much plat did people lose on this? How many of you spent thousands
of plat and will see it wiped out with no return (and possibly
negative points for your trouble)?
