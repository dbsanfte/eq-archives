I played my human mage to 21 without a single piece of int gear.  
Got there in less than 2 days.  That's a human mage with a base
int of 110.  I played to 45ish with 138 int.  Never saw the need
to get more gear - it just doesn't make much of a difference.  
The big boosts I got were mainly gifts from a RL buddy of mine.
I then gave up a bunch of int to wear 3 of my focus items.  Why?
Because they increase the efficiency of my nukes - far more valuable
than the quantity.  Level 53 (nearly 54) mage - 153int.
