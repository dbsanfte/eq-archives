Took a HE Paladin w/Jade Mace from 1-25 in less than 11 hours with 43 shaman 
PLer. Levels 11-24 in Paud Caverns. Didn't slow mob, let Paladin gain skills 
and she hit ungodly fast, hard and landed more than 50% of the hits. When mob 
was at 49% health, cast winters roar, insti death.

Actually shocked me how fast the Paladin leveled and gained skills.
