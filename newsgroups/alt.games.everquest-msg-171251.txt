I thought that might be it, I have been doing this quite a bit, but have now
learned I may be losing out on defence ability, but with a newly recruited

Yeh it uses alot of arrows but I am learning fletching so always have lots
to spare :)

I just fletch the cheapest 150 range arrows for fighting, any others are
just to increase my fletching skill.
