If I may put on my "religious nut" hat for a few minutes, I would recommend
*against* buying this nice weapon in the Bazaar. I would recommend against
buying *any* gear in the Bazaar. And here's why.

First, you don't need it. You can actually get by on gear you can loot off
mobs you can kill. Really! And because you won't be wearing godlike gear,
you will have a lot of incentive to develop skills and strategies in playing
your character. Otherwise, there will came a point for you, late in the
game, where you will find that there is no more ubergear left that you can
buy to make up for your lack of crucial play ability, and you have too
many bad habits to unlearn.

Second, it gives you an excuse to go hunt in zones you might not ordinarily
go to. Do research on allakhazam or wherever to see what gear you might
want, and where it drops, and who drops it. Then go hunt there. It probably
won't be one of the 3 zones that's on the "fast xp" track, but it gives
you a reason to travel, see new sights, figure out how the zones connect,
see interesting critters, hunt things that you might otherwise never
encounter. You're a new player, and there's a *ton* of content out there.
It would be a shame to bypass it all.

Last and most important, there's more fun (in my opinion) in looting an item
that's an upgrade than there is in shopping for gear. A lot more fun. And
shopping for gear in the Bazaar is the best way to guarantee that nothing
you hunt for the next 30+ levels will ever drop anything that you'd ever
want. Do you *really* want to wait until you're level 54 before you loot
an item you'd actually want to keep? 


I'll admit that this is likely a minority opinion. I'm not sure I would
give the same advice to a player who has done the 1-70 route for a dozen
chars already: they probably already know what aspects of the game they
like and how to maximize them. I'm also not trying to promote a "things
were so much better back in the golden ages" nostalgia. I'm just pointing
out that there are other, less obvious, ways of playing that pay off
in different ways.
