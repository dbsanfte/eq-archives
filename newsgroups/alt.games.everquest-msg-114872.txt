Yes! It was fun! I decided to make a Tabby shaman and since all my
characters were in a land far, far away (im really too lazy to spend
the time walking or porting just to twink a level 1) I decided to
learn the joys of newbie shar vahl quests. I dinged to about 7 with
only a wooden spear (that i saved up to buy at 1 or 2pp) my cape and a
hopper hide buckler. Now the hopper hides took me long enough to find
since the drops were kind of rare but i killed lotsa blues along the
way. Then I had to learn brewing to do the next quest which involved
using xakra bile, scorpion blood and a flask of water. A couple hours
later i had both scorpion blood but the damn bile wouldnt drop off the
many worms i killed. Then I said screw it....im going outside for a
while. Then I start working on killing shades to do the jawbone quest.
After killing umpteen shades and no jawbone drop I had hit 7 but no
good equipment, spent all my money on spells and everything is kicking
my ass creating downtime. Ahhh screw it. I transferred some armor and
a couple hundred plat from my cleric to my druid and ran her over to
shadeweaver and now my tabby is running around kicking ass. The charm
of new characters runs out after the first roadblock for us "gotta do
it now" types.

Think they should increase the drop rates or leave as is? I mean its
all no drop stuff so its not like people are gonna be selling it. And
if by the time you do manage to get all the drops of all the items
necessary for you to complete youre newbie armor quests, your newbie
armor isnt sufficient for the Temple of Veeshan.
