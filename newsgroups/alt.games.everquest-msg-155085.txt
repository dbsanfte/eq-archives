Half Elf Rangers can start in SFG or GFay.  Yes, they get infravision.
As a special bonus, Half-Elves are permitted only three spell-casting
classes (Druid, Ranger, Paladin), all of which are WIS based, and they
have a -15 racial adjustment to WIS.  This, combined with there being
very very few Half Elf vendors in newbie areas, and the -5 to STR and
-5 to CON racial adjustments they also get (further gimping Paladins
and Rangers, while also penalizing their two remaining class choices
Warrior and Bard), and the fact that unlike the much taller High Elves
Half Elves cannot wear small armor... these are mot of the reasons
that more than a few of us believed TheVision(tm) took the form of a
perpetual scowl when it bothered to turn and regard Half Elves.  The
crowning blow came when cultural smithing was introduced and it was
made clear that there would be no cultural smithing for Half Elves,
which annoyed the hell out of Half Elven Paladin/Smiths like myself
throughout the game.

I'm still waiting for Half Elf Shadowknights and Necromancers.  The
time for us to rise up and throw off the yolk of our goody-two-shoes
oppressors and all of their limp-wrist collaborators is upon us.
Come Brothers and Sisters, let us teach our children true strength
and embrace the dark side!  Build for yourselves altars of darkness
and pain and give central place to the festering and corroded image
of that paragon of unrepentant wrong:  Chimp von Rastus.  Summon forth
your Gimp and go wreak havoc upon all who dare oppose your will.  Half
Elves of Norrath unite!  Together we shall overcome the puny obstacles
that stand before us and take our revenge for untold centuries of abuse!
