The only pumice changes that I remember are when egg-shaped puimce was
removed because (IIRC) someone decided that an insta-cast, fizzle-
proof dispel was too unbalancing (don't remember if it was a PvP issue
or across the board).  It was replaced by crystallized, which has a
casting delay.  This then became a PvP issue because pure melees had
no Channeling skill and were trivial to interrupt during the cast.
Don't remember exactly how they fixed that--I think they gave melees
an arbitary channeling skill of 50 or whatever.

This is all based on my memory of patch messages and subsequent
discussions--I'm too lazy right now to try to dig up any old posts. ;)
