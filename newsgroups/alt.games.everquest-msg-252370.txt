I apparently have 2 characters with corpses present in shadowrest.

How do I find shadowrest?  I know I am supposed to talk to someone, but 
when I ask I am unable to find out who to talk to to find it.  Someone 
said it was a female near the bank in plane of knowledge, no female at 
either bank when I looked.  Another said it was off plane of knowledge, 
not much help.

I'd like to retrieve anything on these two bodies, one for the owlbear 
pelts I know is on it, the other I suspect has nothing but it would be 
nice to not have that message.

Any help would be appreciated.
