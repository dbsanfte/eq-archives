"Hail, Biker Fred"

"Oh Hi, Gabriel, I was sitting here with my gang. We are in need of
some things for our party. I was about to send someone to get
[Budwieser] but we are all busy right now.

"What Budweiser?"

"It is a the beer we all drink. If you fly, we will [buy]."

"I will buy"

"Great, Gabriel, here is a bag. When you get six Budwiesers, combine
them in this six pack."

You go get the beer.
You combine the beers and hand it to Biker Fred.

Your faction standing with Outlaws got better.
Your faction standing with StormGuard got better.
Your faction standing with HellsAngels got worse.
Your faction standing with MillerBrewing got worse.
"Thanks, we are short cash, let my girl give you a hickey instead."
You gain experience!!
You receive a hickey.
