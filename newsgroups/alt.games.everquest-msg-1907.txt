Hmmm.  In hindsight, I should have not posted when I was upset.  I should
have waited, cooled down, and obviously used less flammable language.  Asked
something along the lines of:  Why did Verant include two games in the Scars
expansion disk that are unrelated to EQ rather than give us more expansion
material?

I'm not backing down from my position.  I'm merely apologizing for using
flammable language.
