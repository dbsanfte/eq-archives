Ayup.  Once my ranger hit 22 he churned 2 levels in 8 hours.  0
downtime.  And in Lake of ill manners he takes yellow sabertooth
grimalkins with almost no risk, and the xp beats almost every group I've
been in at that level.  I know of places that if there were groups
available I wouldn't be having the same problem, but people are afraid
of those places.
