I didnt know scouts did a huge amount of damage. Coming from playing 
standard RPG's like Baldurs Gate I always think of scouts as quick thief 
like players that dont do much damage but can come in handy disarming traps 
and scouting ahead.

I really can't decide what to do at the moment, though reading what you 
wrote it seems the scout class maybe what I am looking for.

Is a half-elven/elven scout too cliched :-)
