Ever notice that if you role play most of the population will just gawk and
try to figure out why this guy is talking like that? I have switched to
Sullon Zek and grouped with some one who was rp'ing, the first person to
role play I have seen in forever. When I spoke to him I was RP, but then the
others in the group wouldnt talk to him much, if at all.

I know FV is the RP server, but it seems the meaning of RPG is lost, now it
(EQ ect) is just a fps with swords.


Bummer.

When I first bought EQ i was in tears, joy overwelmed my being. I am living
the dream I drempt so many years ago when I was playing MUD's and wishing
that they where 3D.

Now it just kind of like quake with a sword at times.



Just a thought.
