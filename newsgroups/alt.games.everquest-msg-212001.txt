In my opinion, they've been changing the ZEMs invariably upwards, in an 
ongoing (and unnecessary) trend to make the game easier,...

...And/or possibly to encourage groups to  take chances in new zones 
(far too many) people would just avoid until maps, spawn times, mob 
levels, mob abilities, and plenty of solid tactics get published on the 
web...so they up the ZEM to compensate for deaths (if not the death xp 
itself since 96% rezes are common at the endgame, then the lost 
opportunity to generate xp as the group re-groups from a wipe.)

> That and loot and of

Yeah I'll buy into loot, and I'll also buy into taking advantage of the 
non-combat related conveinces (mapping, the lucling spires, the pop 
books, etc etc), and the ability to advance 'maxxed out characters' even 
more.

> course being able to find a group sell expansions like crazy.

Again, I'm not seeing that as a real impetus to buy expansions. Its a 
benefit sure, as a significant block do move to the expansion zones, so 
having the expansions do increase your grouping possibilities...I can 
see that... but I don't see that as being a prime motivator to shelling 
out for an expansion.

Alright... anyone else backing this up? Specifically, is there anyone 
who'll admit they line up to buy expansions primarily in order to PL 
their '3rd alts'?
