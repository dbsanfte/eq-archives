}Yes, I've rolled back drivers too, but there is absolutely no getting
}around the always asked very first question:
}"Are you using the latest drivers?"

True, although usually what the questioner meant, if they really thought 
about it, is "Are you using the latest -stable- drivers?"

}To chastise someone or act like they are an idiot for not upgrading
}drivers is ridiculous.... only when the new driver proves to be a
}blow-out should this question be asked. 

Ahhh I see.  See, I didn't read it as chastisement or idiot-treatment.  
Wanting to know what prompted the upgrade seems to me a perfectly 
legitimate question.  Since, if we can figure out what was not working 
that prompted the upgrade, that may have something to do with why it isn't 
working now.

}"You bought new tires for your car? Sure the other ones were bald, but
}they were still round...."

Ohhhh... they were -bald-.  Well, that explains it.  

Go back and read it as, "You bought new tires for your car?  Were they 
bald?  Out of balance?  Have nails stuck in them?  Past the warranty?"
