Forgot to add this part in last post. Yes, making money is the primary idea,
but also enough EXP to not go backwards at the same time.  You mention
turning in the molars...do I need to worry about other factions first?  Ones
that the killing won't effect?  I don't want to be handing in the molars &
have some other NPC take me out (like the ****ing guard thingy that ran up
to me while memorizing spells at the druid ring, killed me once, almost did
another time, resulting in faction hit).
    I'm bound by the druid at the druid ring, that way I can just gate back
with my stuff, and make the longer walk TO the Warrens.
