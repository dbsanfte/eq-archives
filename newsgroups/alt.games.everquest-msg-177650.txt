Google is your friend:

here's the allakazim one:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2200

I had found some on some guild board that were a bit more concise, but
can't seem to find them now.

Playing a crappy cha assling cleric, I go buy two opal steins putting my
cha up to 100 (110 is better), and a sow potion from the bazaar (or find
someone willing to sow you, but that slows your running around down when
it wears off).  requires about 26pp to do with maxed cha, grosses 60 pp,
so make sure you have enough cash first.  I'd suggest getting a kei as
well as soon as you can aford it to help with the gating, and let you
get some extra xp nuking down mobs if you can cast (obviously sow & kei
don't apply to bard.  Bind near the nexus book, get the box from trepp
just south of the library by saying "I am ready to begin", go through
each of the books neccessary buy components and gate back to pok,
leaving firona for last - where I nuke down a drachnid or two for some
extra xp & loot on the way, using travel time as medding time, and after
combining the box, pick it up out of inventory again put it back, buy
the weapons again.  then go through the cycle again and leave great
divide for last, repeat proceedure with drakkel wolves and armor.  tada
7-8% xp pluss 1 or 2 percent for nuking down mobs for a min. for each
trip.  This will = 36-40% xp & 136+pp per hour if you pull it off
perfectly.  Of course I rarely pull it off perfectly, usually f'ing
around with the mobs, etc, so that will slow you down, and I'm not sure
how fast a bard could do it with no gate, but I have a fast connection
and zone fairly quickly.  

Drops down to 5% per box at 40th-43rd so far, and the dracnids mostly
aren't worth killing any more but you can move on to frost giants in
GD.  It would proably not be worth it at 40+ for non-gaters considering
extra time, but I'm still able to get about 25% xp & 136+pp per hour
perfectly executed.   I'm still unable to find anything that's giving
better xp and loot.  Tried velktor's (group), & echo caverns (solo) so
far, going to try karnors tomarrow and see if that's better, velktor's
was giving about = xp, but echo was much worse.

Also if you are a wizard or druid (I think) you can do like a lesser
evac in FV to get to town, going even faster through this than I. 
There's an evil run of this quest I've heard that can be run in
Overthere instead of FV, and uses the evil vendors in the other cities.
