EQ has no future... The way the things ae going I give EQ maybe 1 or 2
years at the most before it goes the way of the Dodo. 
Verant has 4 new online games coming out as it is.
Star Wars Galaxies will be priority #1, EQ2 will be #2, and depending
what the out come is for Planetside and Sovereign, old EQ maybe #4 or
#5 on there list of Priorities. 
Just from the vibe I got talking to the deveopler of the upcoming
Planes expansion at E3 this year, Verant is just keeping it alive a
little longer. But in his words " No plans of yet for any expansion
after Planes, but if there is I wouldn't be surprise to see that high
elf on the cover beating a dead horse." off the record of course.

Verant is betting on EQer's to move on to EQ2 , those that don't will
get shit for support, shit for service and shit all around... you
don't like that.... too bad.

And they are betting BIG time on SWG, but they can't lose on that one,
Star Wars is just way to big of a property to blow, and Lucas games is
helping them out of course, from what i saw of the game at E3, it WILL
blow EQ's numbers out of the water. And EQ2 is just what EQ should be
if they ever fixed all the shit wrong with it. The only people that
won't move on are those that can't or won't get a new computer or
those that that just don't have a life and refuse to believe that they
have wasted so much time on a game and those are the people that will
still be trying to get there Epics and planning raids  for the
following  week when they get the message, " World coming down for
good in 10 mins, we at Verant thank you for playing Everquest ."

But don't fret...You will still be able to play EQ but only on a PS2,
Oh yeah , don't forget money Verant is sinking into Everquest Online
Adventures coming too you on your TV via a PS2.Hmm maybe that will be
prioirty #3 .Hey but at least a PS2 is only $199 at Best Buy, Oh .but
wait you need the PS2 Modem aswell to play, but thats only about $100
to $150. And don't forget the Game $50, Oh and the service charge,Just
because it a PS2 doesn't mean you still don't have to pay to play.
Hmmm thats $500 right there Another $200 and I might aswell get that
new computer and Play EQ2.

I like EQ, I have 2  52 Lvl charaters and 1 young wizzy at 18, But I
will never get my epics and more that likely never get to 60. I plan
on moving on to SWG. For one I like the way trade and commerce is set
up, much more fun than giving yourself carpal tunnel from tailoring or
baking.

But like I said EQ is in a Death Rattle at the moment and they are
just trying to keep it on life support. The signs are there and have
been there for a while. No more server numbers since DAOC came out so
you the consumer would not see the drop, Legends to give the high
rollers a world of their own, but hey ,they do get the best service on
legends, wait time for a Petition is all most instant.No more hell
levels.
And coming up...A new User Interface for EQ, as if that will help game
play, How often have you looked at the inter face and said " Gee, I
wish this Inter face was nicer so I can stare at it while I med and
heal". So Fucken stupid. And don't get me started on the Bazzar,
EQer's if you have noticed are a lazy bunch with the Give me this and
give me that < Bazzar will not work,you really only have to do  a few
things to set up shop but thats a few things to many for some, and was
the moon really the best place to have put it at.

Just my rant on what I see coming.....
