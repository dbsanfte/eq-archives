I can only speak for myself: Twinking is the equivalent of turning the game
difficulty level down. I'm sure jealousy is one aspect for some people,
elitism is probably the dominate one. It may even be a combination of the
two and additional ones I haven't figured out yet.

For instance, I just checked a level 1 character and it had 20 hit points.
You twink that character with 100 hps worth of hardware and you have just
turned the volume of you difficulty knob down by a factor of 6 with respect
to hps alone. Add in the other little perks like AC and stat bonuses and the
twink is playing such a low level game it can't be equated with a non twink.

IMHO: The game difficulty level is too high for the average consumer w/o
twinking<justified>.

There is way to much ego involved in this game and over the top connection
to characters. I mean it is your<generic your, not you your> pixels that
slew that dragon and you don't really have 10,000 pp in the bank. In all
likelyhood, the dragon slayer isn't old enough to drive yet let alone slay a
dragon.

The currency for bragging rights in this game<outside of the newsgroup> has
always been levels for ~90% of the players. Around here it is how well you
play at level and how much you know.

This creates two divergent groups that will naturally have conflict: People
who turned down the difficulty level of the game by twinking and don't know
the game from 1-20 and those that have played it as designed and have
intimate knowledge.

The conflict will always be between "I am superior to you because of my
levels" vs "They don't count because you had the difficulty setting on
beginner when you made them." Cows will be programming VCRs before the
conflict ends. I doubt if VI gives a carp<sic> since all the spin on the
subject is just free advertising for them.
