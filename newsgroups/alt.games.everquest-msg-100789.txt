In my experience a 56K winmodem is just fine, even a generic one with
EQ.  Biggest problems with modems are keeping connection not with lag.
Usually your home phone lines and the ISP you connect with is the
problem.  Try a different dial-in number and a different phone plug in
your home.  You may have a crappy ISP with outdated equipment or an
overloaded connection to the Internet.  EQ plays better with Cable or
DSL but analog modem should work fine.

There is an EQ setting; I am not sure what it is called.  It controls
the speed that you receive info from EQ.  Drop it down one number.


Turn off ALLL of the SOL skins and additions.  Disable all but the
most needed features in the game. ie.. 3dsky, misses, etc......


Get a total of 512M memory. I am guessing that is the total your
motherboard can use.  Research that and get the max.


Upgrade your video card. A low end video card will appear to have a
lot of lag. I do no have any recommendation for vid cards.  They
change so much.  I have 3 PC's.  One PC is a PIII 600 with a generic
ATI Radeon.   It lags to hell.  I have a PIII 800 with a real deal ATI
Radeon no problems.  The 600 is my weakest PC but plays great when I
strip all the skins.



Finally.  Buy two removable trays, another hard drive, and a copy of
XP HOME OEM.

The GM's can not help you with your PC
