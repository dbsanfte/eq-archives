Was that in that book? Shit, it's been a while. Anyway, I was actually
referring to the American historical record of penniless, homeless
drunks during the depression and prohibition era (and a good while
after, possibly to this day) who would drink rather... "inappropriate"
things when booze was unaffordable and/or illegal. Some of the most
common were, of course, codiene based cough syrup if they could find it,
aftershave, other isoproply alkeemahol based substances, etc.

But one of the seriously fucked up ones was cans of Sterno. As anyone
who's seen Sterno (including Biz or anybody in the food/catering/etc.
industries has, since it's commonly used for chaffing dishes and such)
could tell you, it's a nasty little paste that you don't even want to
get on your hands. But apparently, at least in NYC, some of the bums got
in the habit of purchasing it. (Could be gotten for pennies a can at
that time). It was then taken and smushed on to slices of bread and
squeezed to get a straight liquid out of it. The liquid, of course, is
now "drinkable" as opposed to edible, and some sort of myth arose that
the bread acted as some kind of "filter" to get the toxic crap out of
it. Yeah, apparently it would give you one hell of a buzz, but a fairly
small amount of it would drive you crippled -> crazy -> blind -> dead in
short order. The street lingo called it "squeeze" from how it was
created. Pretty sad, but an interesting twisted story none the less.

Bizbee's lack of answers to any questions in this thread were what made
me jokingly suggest that he hadn't been filtering his "squeeze" well
enough. The sad part is that I actually wasted the time to respond to
dozens of comments he made with legitimate answers, then ask follow up
questions as if I expected him to respond to them, on the topic of the
usefulness of /guildchat, and related topics. Seeing in each of those
posts in this thread that he had *no* answer for any of the points or
questions, he snipped several long discussion down to a single paragraph
answer mixing some normal Biz insults with an answer the equivalent of
"I know you are, but what am I?" [insert Pee Wee Herman voice there.]
Could have been a good topic for people buidling mid/upper level guilds,
but what can you do with somebody who is apparently physically incapable
of discussing something where they may have been minorly mistaken on a
point or two without trying to turn it into a war to divert attention
from any possible imperfection in themselves? You'll notice I didnt'
answer any of his tripe in this thread, since he brings nothing to the
table to discuss.

Sad, really.

But for whoever was bored enough to keep reading these tedious posts,
note the following: Of all the folks here, in the many guilds across the
various servers, not ONE FUCKING PERSON stood up to defend Bizbee's
arguments that a rule about having guild chat on was viable, etc. etc.
etc.   But of course, since he said it, it must be God's own word.
