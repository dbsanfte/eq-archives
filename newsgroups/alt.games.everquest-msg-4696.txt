    Not quite. I imagine they're just not giving you the deal they did
before.....

    A person on EQTraders once figured out the following: all items have a
"true cost". Call that X. Your faction, race, charisma, the "greed" of the
vendor and the item itself determine a fraction: a/b, with a<=b. a = b only
if
you have best possible in each category. When selling, you get (a/b)*X as
the price; when buying the same item back, you must pay (b/a)*X. OK, so far,
so good. But what if (b/a)*X yields a fractional amount of copper?

    At present, given that nobody has yet said they scammed the vendors, it
looks like the game engine truncates fractional copper. All well and
good.... until you buy a multiple. I imagine they have the price charged be
computed by c*(b/a)*X, where c = # of items bought. The engine would then
truncate THIS value, and you would seem to "overpay" by an amount roughly
equal to the old truncation amount times the number of items bought.

    OK, the reader in back has fallen asleep, so no more math. Promise. ;-)
I'd love to see someone determine the following points about selling, just
because I'm curious:

1) How "finely" does faction determine price. Does high apprehensive differ
from low apprehensive, in other words. Also, how does the fraction vary with
faction steps (amiable->indifferent->apprehensive)?
2) Does race really matter for pricing, or are we seeing the effect of
inherent greed on a vendor and thinking it's race? Is the race factor
coarse - you do/don't match vendor race - or fine - you are a half elf, and
dwarves view half elves as...?
3) What are the "step" levels for CHA to change price? Is it the same as
other scores, eg. jumps at 75 and 100?
4) What vendors are known to be greedy? To have least greed in a given area,
or for a given faction group?
5) What items have the "natural" fractions closest to one? What is the most
expensive item with a small percentile difference from a fraction of one?
What is the most expensive item with a small percentile difference from a
fraction of one? These items could, in effect, become the new "standard of
trade" if common enough and if value/weight made them equivalent to a good
deal of plat. ("I'll trade you three stacks of X for the Jaundiced Bone
Boots.")

    Note that I'm not curious enough to attempt to figure this out myself.
;-)
