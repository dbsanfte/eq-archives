Don't get me wrong, I have by far run into more kind and helpful
people for the most part rather than this type of user/player. Early
on I had a couple of different ones go out of their way to help me. I
never forgot. I will continue to be kind and helpful -it was just that
this last one got to me a little. Most people are helpful  in my
opinion.
