started doing this 2 days before I installed luclin but now in luclin I cant
even move and in everywhere else its really laggy.. takes me about 5 min to
zone when it use to take me on my cable modem about 30sec to 1 min to zone
depending on the zone... if there is any way any of you can help me it would
be greatly appreciated.
