Someone on another thread had the best idea I've heard so far, and that
is to not have the corpse appear until you zone into the graveyard zone.
There is some indication that corpses are now part of the character
record, since the corpse zoning change in ldon.  Otherwise the new
graveyard zone will become a lag pit very quickly. As for 10 minute
repop, while it can be convenient in normal experiencing in a plane, try
it on a raid. Ten minutes is not always enough to get a corpse rezzed,
especially if the player went link dead and died from it. Having to send
a cleric all the way to the graveyard zone to rez someone would be
incredibly annoying.
