Ok so Im only a level 24 Paladin, and its taken me roughly 3 months to get
there! Though reading some other comments, I may not be the slowest...

Now some kind person by the name of Lanamora purchased a useless book to me
called Book of the Rings, given to me very early in my life by some passing
magician.

Now I was paid quite well, but she also gave me "Blood of the Wolf potion 5
doses???

Now the questions are...should I sell it?
How much?
Is it like SoW
Can I use it on myself?
If so...How?



And a final question.

If I could travel anywhere faster than the speed of light,

would it  always be dark when I arrived?
