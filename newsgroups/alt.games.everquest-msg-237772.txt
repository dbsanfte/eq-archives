The point of researching it is non-existent. The hypothesis is that we
can't detect it. My point is that stipulating something exists which
is beyond our understanding is pointless... if by *definition* we
cannot understand it then there isn't much point in trying.

There are chaos theory applications to this. Yes.

Granted. But that means the model is incomplete not that the system is
unpredictable by its nature. That was my point. Two universes that
were identical at any given moment would unfold exactly the same way
ever after in a strictly causal system. so if it happened that one
universe became identical to the state the 2nd one was in 1 year ago
then an outside observer & non-interactor could know what was going to
happen in the first one, 1 year in advance.

Because I like my free will.

they are related. if you don't beleive there are exceptions to
absolute causality then free will can't exist.
