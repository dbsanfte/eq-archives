I posted a couple days ago about possibly buying a Dell.
Anyways have decided against them for convenience sake.
My next dilemma is the video card and Ram. The system
I am thinking about now is
p4 2.4
80gig ultra ata hdd
512 pc 2100 ram
cd burner
Nvidia GF4 mx440(this is the card system comes with standard)
SB Live 5.1
XP Home

What I really would like is the ATi 9700 but the price is out of my
league...so I am considering the Geforce 4 Ti 4200 128, has anyone
had experience with this card and are you happy with it?

Next question is...I asked at the store about upgrading to pc2700 Ram
but the salesman told me that this type of Ram is not really a standard
and can be unstable...this is the first time I have heard this. Is there any
truth to this? Would I be gaining much performance by upgrading the Ram
to 2700 or should I just stick with the 2100 and possibly add in another
512Mb Ram?

Thanks Again for the help )
