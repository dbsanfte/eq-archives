	I don't believe this is true.  I never noticed higher resists when
Aethanie (20 Mage) used them, and now that knockback is no longer an effect
but an attribute of the spell I wonder if it has any effect on resists at all.
(The knockback on Venture's Call of Sky procs didn't have any effects on its
resists, either, but it's a lure.)

	The Mages need to educate their guildmates, then.  There are fewer LOS
issues on bolts than there are on archery.
