Not only is it the fastest way, you're the best suited class for it too!

I found it easy to just grab a nice size train and tanking them all while
twisting AE dots (the dot/slow Melody of Mischief makes this even easier
for a bard). I could almost kill every mob in the zone before respawns,
though I mostly kept to the castle as there was often exp groups killing
the mobs outside (never saw one in the castle).

Still, expect quite a few hours of grinding faction before you're ally
with faction song.
