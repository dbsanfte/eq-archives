Amen, amen and amen some more.... I stopped playing my cleric because I 
wasn't able to get any good groups at level 36..... I was given LDoN for 
Christmas and went to one of the Wayfarer's camps and immediately got 
into a good group. Now less than a week later I'm at level 39.

If you need anything more than good ol' clarity then you're a bad cleric 
(period). I've found it no problem to do an LDoN at 40% mana going into 
it and barely ever going below that mark. The only time I've lost 
someone was when an enchanter attempted to mez a group of mobs and got 6 
mobs on him and the tanks were unable to taunt agro and my heals though 
they came as fast as I could cast them just weren't enough to save him.

As Runelord said; tip #1 for a cleric: instead of dropping your best 
heal, give the main tank your heal over time spell. I usually do this 
when someone who has agro gets to approx. 80% hp and it has always 
worked for me so far.
