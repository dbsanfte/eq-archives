Oh, now you are just being silly with semantics. :) Point is, my
*character* has a role, and her subclass provides her with a few extras,
some useful, some pointless.  It doesn't really bother me that my role is
the same as the shaman or druids (though many have said that the druids
role is as the best secondary healer in the game, but they make OK
primaries too, so that isn't a firm niche).  I can't wrap my brain around
why it should bother me that I share that role, to be honest, but that's
the fun of me not being the same person as you or anyone else, heh.

I guess the major difference is that I don't ask myself "Does my character
have a role?" but "Is my character fun?".  One thinks about roles when
finding a place in the world matters, whether in groups, guilds, or their
own heads.  But since I duo comfortably and have had many guild invites
and plenty of group invites without even being LFG...it doesn't seem I
need to worry about it.

And yes, I find it fun being a templar. My heals are unlike any heal we
saw in EQ-L.  My debuffs are actually effective.  My plate armor means
more than it did on EQ-L clerics and from all reports, it sets temps/inqs
above the shaman and druid insofar as survivability is concerned.  My
melee and nukes are, well, a bit like henpecks, but you can't expect the
world. :)  Oh, and I can make people swim faster, which I find excessively
cool for some odd reason.

<tangent>
Mind you, templars have THE dumbest flavor spells in the world.  No,
seriously. We make spell effects appear around someone but there's no
spell (that's a "blessing"...and gee, i always thought buffs were
blessings :P). We can Detect Evil, but, um, so can anyone who knows the
command /who evil %t.  I can make a macro for that and save 2g!  Our 45th
level high elf lacky is pretty cool, but it'll take a while to get there.
</tangent>

Why am I saying all this? I don't expect to convince you 42, obviously. :)
But there might be folks reading this and I figure it's worth hearing my
perspective as well.
