That's completely up to you.  Do you want to get some AA abilities
before you hit a certain level?  If not, wait to 65.  Just remember
that at 51, each AA costs you an entire regular level's worth of exp. 
You could be level 54, or you could have 3 AAs.  At 65 you can get an
AA in an hour of xp grinding.

Personally I see little sense going 50% or 20% or whatever, except
when placing 80% or 90% in AA so that you can work on alternate
advancement without too much danger of deleveling.
