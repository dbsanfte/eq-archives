}Why are we attracted to beauty?

We may have various opinions about what is or is not beautiful.  Because 
beauty, you see, is subjective.  That's where the whole line about it 
being in the eye of the beholder comes from.

}Why do we feel a fundamental violation when a theocratic fundamentalist 
}state blows up two ancient icons of another religion?

Because we were raised in a culture that stronly supports the ideas of 
religious tolerance and freedom, as long as we're not talking about people 
who consider drugs we don't approve of a sacrament, people who sacrifice 
animals to their gods, satanists, witches, or, this year, Fundamentalist 
Muslims.

}I postulate that, inside us all, is the whisper of Good, pointing our
}hearts, minds, and civilizations towards something greater than we have
}today. That, then, is evidence of "counter-evil" and suggests that Good and
}Evil are spiritual, not rational concepts -- and that they are
}transcultural, not state defined. 

This is the very crux of your argument -- almost.  I'd agree with it 
completely.  But the idea you're missing here is that that whisper of 
Good?  We simply don't all hear the same whisper.  And that's exactly what 
"subjective" means.

}And that logic itself cannot define Evil or Good.

Logic can do whatever it damn well pleases.  I've seen plenty of logical 
arguments that I would still judge to be wrong.  Their proponents would 
get all upset and jump up and down about how 'logical' an argument it was.  
But there's three basic problems.  

First, all logic is really good for is dividing statements in to truth and 
falsehood based on how they relate to an initial set of postulates that 
are assumed to be true or false.  If I disagree with your initial 
postulates, then there's no way in heck your logical arguments will ever 
convince me.

Second, the rightness or wrongness of many things can have as much an 
emotional basis as a logical one.  You can start with postulates I agree 
with, conduct a perfectly logical argument, and come to a conclusion.  But 
if that conclusion does not jibe with my "whisper of Good" and what it 
tells me, I'm sorry mate, but you're hosed.

Third, go learn in detail about Godel's Incompleteness Theroem.  It's fun.
