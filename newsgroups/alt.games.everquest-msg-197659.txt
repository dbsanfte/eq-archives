being a druid i know the pain of being bugged for ports while fighting etc.
etc. anon mostly worked. And fighting with afk message sory busy fighting
but i'm willing to break it for 1k to port you also chases ppl away or look
for other options. Another annoying thing ids when you have just 15 minutes
at hand and you decide to port, ppl hardly donate or you end up with ppl on
a corpserun. (i've never accepted donations from anyone on a cr) But despite
that i've made good money out of it
