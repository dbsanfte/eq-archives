$14.99 for month to month. It's cheaper to buy 6 or 12 months at a
time per month, though.

Then there's the all access pass, which includes subscriptions to EQ2,
Planetside, EQOA, and EQ1 as well as some of their other smaller
station games. I believe that runs somewhere between $20-25, not sure
exactly offhand.
