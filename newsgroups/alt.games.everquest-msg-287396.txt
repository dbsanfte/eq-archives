Simple, WoW promotes accessibility to a fault. Character progression
in WoW is just...easy. You don't have to group. You hardly have to
think. Tradeskills are automatically acquired. All you have to do is
skin what you kill or loot every applicable harvestable you find along
the way, and the crafting process itself is overly simplified. Classes
balanced for PvP are boring. None can have any sort of "cool"
abilities for fear of upsetting that balance. There are too few
classes (in the interest of further facilitating class balancing).
Skills customization amounts to earning points to spend to increase
the damage of your nukes by 1.6% or something silly per rank.

Besides, I think you're being a bit overly sensitive to my "drooling
masses" comment. It has been my experience that the percentage of the
WoW population that would fall into that category is *much* higher
than in EQ. I even went on to clarify that I am completely aware that
segment does not comprise all WoW players. Basically, if the shoe
fits... /shrug

Uh huh. How many players were required for that to happen? In WoW, you
can do it all by yourself as in it's not as difficult as in it's
easier.

IMO, yes.

Yup, and much more of it.

Easily. Every MMORPG should take a cue from the epic quests in EQ.
Beyond that, FedEx and Kill x Mobs quests are offered a-plenty by both
games.

> Better crafting?

It's no worse from the actual crafting standpoint, but, as I mentioned
above, the elements that support crafting, from obtaining the
components to the chance of actually (*gasp*) failing a combine do
make for a more compelling system.

You're putting a few words into my mouth there. WoW appeals more to
the least common denominator. Let's just leave it at that. Again, of
course there are plenty of fine, upstanding folks playing it as well,
but it is at the same time most *definitely* the preferred playground
for the "drooling masses".

Absolutely.

Perhaps, but like I said, would you pay $15/mo. to play chess? I
wouldn't, though I do like chess. /shrug
