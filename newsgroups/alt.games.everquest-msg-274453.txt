I don't think 1) & 2) really exist in video game associations.

All decisions are effectively, if not explicitly 3). If a unilateral 
action is taken that doesn't get approval from the group the guild 
disintegrates or re-organizes. Note the approval can be, and usually is 
*tacit*.

A guild leaders power of command is totally unenforceable. His job is 
really to mediate, negotiate, and build consensus. This applies from 
policy, to loot distribution, to selecting raid targets.

Generally, a good guild will have the illusion of 1) & 2) decisions, 
because the leader *has* tacit approval. That's why the people stay in 
the guild; the leaders direction is harmonious with their own 
preferences and goals. But the reality in my experience is that a 
'command decision' that fails to meet tacit consensus rarely survives.
