It wasn't a fit of pique at all Palindrome, nor were they upset.  These
are people that target any and every newsgroup that gets proposed at
alt.config, especially the ones that look like they might be legitimate.
Their purpose is to simply cause grief wherever and whenever they can, for
their amusement.  I almost wish they were upset or did it out of anger at
me because that wouldn't unnerve me as much (I don't like knowing that
people who get kicks out of random acts of nastiness exist), but they did
it simply because they could.  The fact that I have a webpage in my sig
that shows a "real face" behind it might have excited them even
more...that's my guess anyhow.
