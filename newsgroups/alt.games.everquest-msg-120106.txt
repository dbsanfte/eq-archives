Silly boy, of course you have.  What you aren't seeing is that a) the
rule you quoted was an example of a training offense, not the end all
and be all of valid guard interaction; and b) No the manual suggests
running to guards to save your butt, not to use them to gain exp without
intended risk.  Or can you see those things and still make your claims? 
Wouldn't be the first time an exploiter was duplicitous.

No I didn't give  any details did I?  The reason for that was folks such
as yourself.  I see no reason to spell  out exploits that the dimmer of
your crowd can't come up with on their own.  As for proof, it would be
illegal for me to hack into VI's databases and produce evidence of
actions against accounts for such acts and that would be the only valid
proof.  I know what I know, if you choose not to believe me that is not
a problem for me.  I still know what I know.

Novel tactics are how I make my living.  It is for that very reason that
I abhor exploiters.  The challenge to any game is to excell within the
rules, not to find a away around the rules.  I am a gamer,  not an
exploiter.

No they are more complex.  Here is one quoted from the "book", I know
how much you like quoting that:

11.You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not
communicate the existence of
   any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or
unintended benefits in
   game), either directly or through public posting, to any other user
of EverQuest. You will
   promptly report any such bug via the in-game "/bug" command or via
the eqtesting@soe.sony.com
   email address.

(For those wondering if guards getting exp for players is a feature, and
I know Zeller is <eg>, I'll remind you of the changes that were made to
guards a long time ago.  Can't recall if it was in beta or early retail,
but the Atone step that the OP mentioned using wasn't required.  Guards
didn't used to KS from players.  Of course this was exploited to great
extent, often with the added joy of getting players killed who needed
the guards because some idiot was using them as pets.  That is why
guards were changed.  This seems to indicate that using guards to gain
exp is not an intended feature in the eyes of the developer.  It also
shows how exploiters hurt real players.  Every time a guard steals your
kill thank the exploiters.)

Funny how you were able to find a reference to guards in the PNP section
of the conduct page, but totally missed the rule that actually applies. 
Still not sure if you are a very sly rules lawyer willing to twist facts
as your sort will, or just really inept.  Ah well, good luck on that
rich and powerful thing.
