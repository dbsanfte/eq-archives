From what I can see of the crab recipes, they are fantastic, but I can't see
myself ever getting to level 60, let alone 65, and doing tradeskills based
on the critters i was xping on as a young rogue, i got up to 92 (ok I
confess, i bought the spider legs at the stores, you'd think someone would
sell them at the bazaar for a gold each or sumthin'! (hehehe))

I guess I'll have to look at int/wis gear for a vah shir rogue as things are
plateuing now. Oh well, it was a good run. Here's the highest triv recipe
using cheap storebought ingredients I can find (except for frypan, buy in
bazaar or get smith friend to make it for you):

Patty Melt
This is a Banquet
WT: 0.1   Size: SMALL
stackable
NPC's sell this at 9s9c
NPC's buy this at 8s2c


  a.. Baking Components: bear/lion/wolf meat, cheese, loaf of bread,
non-stick frying pan
  In: spit, oven, tanaan oven, collapsible spit
  Yield: 1
  Also Returns: non-stick frying pan
  On Failure Returns: non-stick frying pan
  Trivial at: 191
Meat is sold a lot of places but it's nicest if you can get the stacks in
your bank as you go; if not, the place in shadowhaven where you zone from
the nexus has a vendor... I can sneak so faction is not an issue. I know
meat can be bought in thurgadin too but I don't know where else.
