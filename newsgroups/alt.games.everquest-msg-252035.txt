Strange. Was your wizard doing any damage before the mob went into run
mode? I know we tested this pretty extensively the last time I pulled
out my monk to PL someone (admittedly this was probably 2 years ago)
but if the cleric waited until the mob was in run mode and the monk
was feigned before doing anything, he wouldn't get any exp.
