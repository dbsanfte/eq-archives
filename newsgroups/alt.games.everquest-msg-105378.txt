Swing, Shming. All I know is I'm getting some popcorn to watch this one.
In any conversation I've read/seen on the various classes, you have
three kinds. Casters, melee, and hybrids. That's a pretty much baseline
definition. Where do *you* put druids and shaman out of these choices? 
Yes, if you wish you can break the casters down into "priest vs. Int
casters", and bards are certainly a grey area. But casters are casters.
Oh, and for the record, my wizard killed a crag spider with his +5 INT
dagger last night. So ;-p  So you're druid ain't all that. :-)
