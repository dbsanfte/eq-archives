I think this was definitely a killsteal, but probably not in the sense
that you would hope. I think that YOU were the one who KS'd them. If you
hit the wisp, and it kept going, that means that it had already aggro'd
on them. They may have hit it first, who knows. The fact of the matter
is, though, that the mob was already engaged in someone else, and had
them at the top of its hate list. What you should have done is followed
it to them, and asked if they wanted help. If you hit a mob, and it's
not low enough to run away due to the self-preservation instinct that
some of them have programmed in, then it's not yours to kill.
