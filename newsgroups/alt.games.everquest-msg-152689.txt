Ahh since Im feeling combative I will take this up. 

The point as I see it is that the level 44 nukes are being applied to
lower level mobs than the druid will at 49. Or one would think.
Therefore your math fails as all damage strength is measured relative
to the mobs being fought, in practice if not in theory. 400 point
nukes look good against an ulthork, very lacking against a Ice giant. 

Course a druids real strength at 49+ is DoT and AoE spells so perhaps
the nuke thing is not even relevant. 

Oops forgot about grouping, never mind )
