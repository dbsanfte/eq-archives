I like just doing the item name in quotes and then adding + everquest, 
IE:

"ruined wolf pelt" + everquest

Lots of times I'll find sites that give better or more complete 
information than Ally's does.  Not that I'm knocking Ally's, heck, it's 
the only site I pay a subscription fee for, and it's worth it :p  But 
still, I found some great information on getting through LGuk that way 
(combined with http://www.archive.org/ to find pages that have 
disappeared).
