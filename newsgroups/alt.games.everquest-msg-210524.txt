My thats almost hateful there.
Its not my fault that wepons and items ALMOST as good as epics can be
bought in the bazaar not to mention the no-drop items. My point was
that given the reward they are too much a PITA to pursue. As for the
NOOBS out there do you realize the SK epic costs money? 1900p plus a
set of fairly decent armor just to raise a stupid faction for a crappy
reward. Epics in serious need of overhaul.

Again outside of clerics and bards I dont see much worth the time of a
few dozen guildies to get these things. For one thing they need to be
soloable quests not freakin raids. Epics should be based on your own
efforts and skill not the size of your guild then they might mean
something again.
