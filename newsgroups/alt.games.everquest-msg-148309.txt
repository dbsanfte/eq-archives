Ok you guys are making my point for me:
Dozens of zones are freakin empty! Doesnt this say something? It aint
a matter of players being sheep its a matter of zone design being
screwed up. Either the risk is too high or the reward is too low or
both. Come on they know what zones need fixing but whens the last time
you saw one fixed? Seem a few nerfed to hell and back though. And the
only thing VI wants is your arse online as long as possible, besides
your money that is ). 

Lastly this from castersrealm:

UBER MOBS ON VACATION

Emperor Ssraeshzra and Lord Inquistor Sseru have been disabled after
an anomaly in their resistance levels was discovered which was
reportedly making the encounters too easy. 
No information has yet come forward from Sony on when they can be
expected to once again exist on Norrath's moon, but hopefully it won't
be too long. 

I rest my case
