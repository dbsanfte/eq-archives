While I agree that from a fantasy world perspective, this would be in keeping
with many popular stories, I don't think it would be feasible. That whole class
balancing thing, particularly in terms of casters vs. bashers would be thrown
out of whack. You'd have to turn around and also give groups of fighters the
ability to get huge damage bonus opportunities for "ganging up" on mobs. And
then the potential for uberdamage would force you to up the mobs to meet it, so
soon the orc pawns in the newbie area would be hitting for 125.
