   This afternoon, I gathered all the info in this newsgroup regarding our
CoH characters  that I could find and compiled them here, at
http://webpages.charter.net/lenny13/age.in.coh.htm .  Please use the email
link in the webpage to send me corrections or updates, or post them to this
thread.

   Also, since there is no clear consensus on where exactly us Everquest
folk should be posting about CoH, I started an Ezboard community forum for
this at http://pub84.ezboard.com/beverquestplayersincityofheroes .  I took
the liberty of making the board geared for all EQ/CoH players rather than
just ager's since well, because it made more sense to me to do it that
way.  I dunno how much activity this board will see, and no, it isn't
usenet, but at least now we do have a place of our own, should we choose to
use it.
