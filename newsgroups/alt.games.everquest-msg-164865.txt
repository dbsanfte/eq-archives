Don't need a Warrior for Exe at least, Guild group I was in did it
(first and only try for three of us) with a Paladin tanking and no
slower at all.  SK, Paladin, Ranger, Cleric, Wizard, Rogue.  Highest
level was 62 lowest 60 so not Vex Thal geared 65s either.

[Borrowed FT boots and horses might have made the difference but I
doubt it was huge.]

Only hiccup was the Cleric running around in circles with the final
mob at 5% chasing her for some reason despite her being the one who'd
done more trials than anyone else so knew *EXACTLY* what was
happening.
