Yeah ive specialised, evocation naturally, already have it around 130 
actually heh, not too shabby for level 32, the other specilisations are 
following slowly, around 50 atm
It would be silly to spend points on languages
Just group with someone who has the languae you want to learn and talk 
to them in the language whilst you fight
Just keep spamming them
Youll learn an entire new language in 10 mins
it wont show on your skills till you relog though
