If they don't want to allow offline selling, how about making it that
as soon as you log on your shop opens for business ? That way I could
be off adventuring while my shop is running and would give even more
time with a vendor going. 

It is just stupid that I have to have my system up and running and
connected with EQ running and a character just standing there doing
nothing. I don't want to run my system 24 hours a day with EQ running
in the background.

Cheers,
