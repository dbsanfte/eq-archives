    It just shows you care about doing your job right, and you care what
others think about you. Both those things make a cleric good. It never goes
away, nor should it - the moment you accept losing someone you've accepted
playing to a lower standard. But you have to be careful to be realistic, to
understand that you can't singlehandedly keep the party alive against any
and all odds. You have to be able to learn from each death, and put into
practice what you learned.

    I was in a hard Miragul's adventure recently with a puller who wasn't
paying attention to what the group was saying. He brought two to camp when I
was LOM (and the only healer), and the one crowd control person was AFK.
Both the warrior and the rogue started losing health. I considered the odds,
decided our only chance was if the warrior lived to get aggro and I didn't
get aggro, and announced a CH on the warrior to the group followed by "go
defensive NOW". I could have fast healed the rogue, backed up with aggro,
and attempted to root the add - but the warrior would have died. A group
heal would have left me a smear on the ice, followed by the rest of the
group. I had no option where the warrior, rogue, and myself would all live,
and the group's best chance was with the warrior and myself alive, so I
chose to let the rogue die. I didn't apologize, and he didn't ask for an
apology - he'd come to the same conclusion I had, and knew he was dead. I
still felt bad that someone had to die, though.

    James
