why you so considered about what zones I've been in?  And when you say
you've been to most of the high lvl zones, how long do you spend there, just
a bit or a long time?

I'm not a troll, I play EQ and yes I've been to Odus, I've been to the
Warrens when it first opened.  Just cause I state my mind on something tho
doesn't make me a troll, a whiner, loser, etc.  Even tho it does seem like
anytime someone dislike something about EQ they are called a troll.  If you
don't like something about EQ or anyother game, don't you have the right to
state how you feel?

Ok, did I say anything that i wasn't happy about the zones I have to go too,
did I say that I had experienced all the zones for my lvl?  No i didn't,
just said why keep giving zone after zone to high lvls when many haven't
been to over half the ones they got now, I think if Verant is gonna do new
zones then they should give new zones to all lvls.
I don't call giving high lvls zones after zone and then releasing one
low-mid zone here and there right.  Theres a bit of zones thats on the map
right now thats still not in the game, maybe try releasing those before
doing new exp paks, Planes, etc.

Well again I've talked to a handful that has said they haven't been to A LOT
of the zones aimed at them.
But sad that a persons not allowed to say anything on these newsgroups
without getting jumped onto, called troll and other names.  Be different if
I was shouting EQ sucked and to go play another game, or going around
talking trash about people.
