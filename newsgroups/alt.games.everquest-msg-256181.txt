Actually:

To get back to pok from:

SRO camp: -> swamp book (~5000, 1 zone)
NRO camp: -> bb book (magus to bb) (~4500, 1 zone)
EC camp: -> fp book  (~3500, 1 zone)
EVR camp: ->evr book (~5000, 0 zones)
BB camp: -> bb book (~4500, 0 zones)

SRO ldon ent -> swamp book (~5000, 1 zone [worst case])
NRO ldon ent -> swamp book (~10,500, 2 zones [worst case])
EC ldon ent -> swamp book (~10,500, 2 zones)
EVR lfon ent: -> evr book (~6000 units 0 zones [worst case])
BB ldon ent -> gfay book (south) ~6000 units 1 zone)


NRO/SRO camps to EC->FP is ~3500, 2 zones, which is shorter distance, 
but the extra zone kills your time. From SRO its faster to run through 
the swamp, and NRo is faster to magus to BB so you only zone once)

The EC LDoN ents to NRo camp is ~6500. Add another 4500 to run from BB->
book brings the total to 11000, 2 zones. Vs 10500 2 zones... so the 
swamp run is only -marginally- better. But in any case you shouldn't 
select to go to EC.

The NRo LDoN has a couple entrances, the worst case is show. Obviously 
from the entrance right by the SRo camp, the shortest route is to swamp 
book, at around ~4000, 1 zone.
