Watch out around the caster's guild, though.  Many a DE Cleric that could
wander freely around Qeynos has come to grief there. :-)  Oh, I think there
might be an NPC on that faction that wanders at night.

The most important lesson for people who had to raise faction to get into
another town is that unless they've /conned *every* NPC, they should always
be careful.
