I haven't had the chance to do it often but if you can swing it
there's something to be said for a shaman and 5 melee/tank group in
LDoN. I might be a bit hesitant to try it on Tak, those dungeons can
range from trivial to one where you're pretty much assured of a 5 pull
in every room but all the other themes should be trivial for that kind
of a group. 

I do like having a main healer (cleric or druid) around though, it's
nice to have backup when you see 4 resist messages on Tigir's. <g>
