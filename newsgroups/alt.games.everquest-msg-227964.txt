Agree and agree, all things I've said before leading up to this.  It's not
that monks are being enhanced that's bizarre, it's the method.  There was a
better way that the *vast* majority of monks would have preferred, and which
would have caused a helluva lot less strife from the other classes.

Simply add an AA for a 100% blur FD, useable on a longer timer than regular
FD.  Allow monks to continue to play like monks, but with improved *monk*
tools.  As it is, we're getting dumbed down bard tools.

The main bard trick that monks don't have access to, is the "perfect"
version of our class-defining trait.  Though I can imagine some fun tricks
to play with highsun, most monks don't give highsun much thought at all. 
And there's a *huge* difference between "feign quite frequently" and "full
mem blur".  HUGE.  :)

That's the problem though.  A monk puller will *not* be as good as any lull
class at "lulling" (we always have been and always will be the best at
"splitting", it's more a matter of time spent).  The monk-lull is a 30s
recast time and 18s duration.  We get to lull *one* mob.  Ever.  There will
never ever be an opportunity to lull a second mob.

There is a chance, we'll have to wait and see how it pans out, that the
lower level lull skill can coexist with the higher one and be able to lull
two mobs in a row.  But that's still half-assed, as the lower lull obviously
has more limitations.

Mentioned above.  Simply making monk tools work better.  If I could feign
with a guaranteed 100% wipe every 30 seconds (versus ~5 seconds on my
regular feign), it would speed up my pulling immensely, as well as giving me
the ability to do a dump pull (several aggroed, drop with regular feign
while only one is in aggro range of the rest of the group, hit my improved
feign to be *sure* I'm not standing back up to a train) and keep my DPS up. 
I do that pull now at times, without the standing back up part.  Due to the
nature of FD, this can actually be an effective way to keep the mobs rolling
in, but at a severe cost to my DPS.  With a 100% wipe ability I would have
choices.

With lull I have a choice as well.  Whether I want to pretend to be an
enchanter/bard/ranger/druid/cleric, and a rather sad one at that (30s/18s).
