Well you see here in lies the problem also. More people are concerned that their
friends are making it with them. They never demand any of my time. I just do it
out of the kindness of my heart. There are many more of us than the ones that
say "do it yourself cause I did". Therein lies the real problem with the flags.
I for one will be glad when I can spend time getting the Spectral parchments I
need for my next level spells WITH my friends at side.
