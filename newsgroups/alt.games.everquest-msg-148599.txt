}Fine Steel Plate for various alts of friends. So 180 skill. Then I got an

Right.  Exactly.  You've been hunting where, exactly?  Ssra?  By the time 
you get to Ssra, you oughta be able to afford 500pp, especially 
considering your potential return on investment, here.  Those pieces made 
from brellium -do- go for multiple Kpp...

And I speak from experience when I say the success rate on DE cultural at 
175 skill (highest banded used to take you) is... not good at all.  Ouch.
