Or you find a different group every week or two, or you have a group that
keeps some of their characters around your level.  There's lots of options.
There's also lots of people to group with, so there's almost always a bunch at
your level, at least for the first year or two of a game's lifecycle.

This is limited advice.  For a certain type of player, who won't be satisfied
unless he's near the top of the heap in terms of character power, avoiding
these games entirely is probably best.  If you like exploring, meeting people,
and killing random stuff regardless of "character advancement", it's very
easy to have an enjoyable evening in the game once or twice a week.

>So, would EQ2 be for me?

Give it a try.

Yup, this happens all the time, and is perhaps more common than a group of
people who know each other well and group often.  Less so in older games,
where the main reason people join is because they have friends there.
