Thanks, I wasn't aware of that!  Like I said, I have no experience
with FV, just have heard about the spider mobs but thought the FV
guards basically stayed over by the docks--I didn't know FV had their
own version of the goons!  I thought maybe evil races could just use
the FV portal to go to LOIO instead of having to go through FM from
the Overthere, but it sounds like they'd be better off going through
FM.
