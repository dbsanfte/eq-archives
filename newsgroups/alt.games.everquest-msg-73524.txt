  No, it's more like this:

  Level 1-9, cap = 20
  Level 11-19, cap = 28
  Level 20 and up = no cap

  Depending on your strength you may hit slightly harder.  I could do
29 damage per hit from 11-19 with my erudite shadow knight, but I saw
an ogre who was hitting for 30 during those same levels who conned
blue to me.  When I hit level 20, I could hit for up to 42 (without
strength buffs) with the same weapon.

  And then certain classes get damage bonuses of some sort at higher
levels.

  So when you reach level 10, the cap is increased.  When you reach
level 20, the cap is gone.
