You are definately an Evil man! I made the mistake of reading the
thread at work. ( I am a doctor, and had a clinic full of patients
when i read it) Suppressing my screams of laughter so as not to alarm
the patients, i fell off my chair and ended up rolling on the floor
making muffled squeals as tears rolled down my face. Unable to
coherently speak in reply to my secretary's worried quiries, she
assumed i was having a stroke and called 911. By the time the
paramedics arrived (very fast response I was pleased to note) I had
regained my composure and my chair. I then faced the embaracing task
of explaining to the paramedics and my worried office staff that i was
REALLY all right and didnt need to go to the hospital. I made a feeble
excuse of of coughing coffee up my nose( like the aformentioned
smoothie!) and sliping off my chair and knocking the wind out of
myself ( Evil Blimp strikes you for 400. You are stunned!) Once the
paramedics left my staff eyed me warily for the rest of the day (
office staff eyes you dubiosly) Luckily the patients were blissfully
unaware of my near demise at the hand of the Evil Blimp! Never again
will I read suck links at the office! They will have to wait untill I
get home and can make a fool of myself in private! Thank you for the
best laugh i have had in months!
