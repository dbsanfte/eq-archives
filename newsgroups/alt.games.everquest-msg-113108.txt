However, if you're in a situation where you're able to kill more mobs in the
same amount of time because of the 6th member, and reduce the risk of corpse
runs and lost xp through death, then I'd say, theoretically, it'd at least
even out.

Of course, I'm no mathematician.  If I were a mathematician, I'd play a
