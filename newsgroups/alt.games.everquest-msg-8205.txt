I thought farming is when you arnt getting XP just the loot, I was getting
XP - 33% of a blue bubble every 3 mins is good XP imo. (Not sure thought-
What exactly is farming?)

No need to jump down my throught, I came here to ask all your advice.
I let the guy have the camp the second time and came to this newsgroup to
get the matter clarified (reasonably behaviour, if you ask me)
(look that word up if it is unfamiliar to you).   is a silly flamey thing to
say.

I did say thank you when he gave me my camp back. I didnt offer to share
because he didnt ask the first time. The second time he certainly didn't
offer to share with me.

Besides, from what I heard and read since it seems that this issue is split
down the middle, so perhaps a few imho would be in order.

Thanks for responding
