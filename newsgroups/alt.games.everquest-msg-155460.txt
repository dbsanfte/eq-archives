I haven't changed resolution in ages, but, as I recall, at 640x480 you are
seeing less of the world than at higher resolutions.  So the question you
are asking is sort of irrelevant.  If you up to 1280x960, you will see four
times as much on the screen.  I could be wrong of course, as I said, it's
been a long time since I have changed resolutions.
