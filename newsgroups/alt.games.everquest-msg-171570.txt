I'm not familiar with Norton's firewall proggy, but have zone alarm pro.  In
that proggy when you allow certain exe's to access the internet (i.e.
Everquest.exe) there is an option that lets the firewall know that the file
changes frequently.  That's designed specifically for proggies that act in
this manner.
