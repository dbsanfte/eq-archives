Did it with my barbrian shaman who may have buffed someone killing
giants in GD but did no conscious faction work.  My DE mage got to
ally killing giants in GD for 5 levels with a couple friends, so we
had lots of extra toes and heads.  I just passed them over to the
barbarian via a friend and then turned them in.  Now to learn baking.
