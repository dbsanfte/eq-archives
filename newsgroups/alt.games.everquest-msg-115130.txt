OK, folks. I posted this same question on this newsgroup for levels 18
to 25 and every response told me to go to Paludal Caverns. All I can
say is "WOW!", thanks guys. That place gives insane xp.

What I'd like to do is get a thread going to describe the best
zones/mobs to get this type of great and fast XP from here on out. I'm
especially interested in the best place for 25 to 30 because that's
where my Wizard is at, but feel free to share your advice for INSANE
XP for any level (ie 30 on up through 60).

The reason I am interested in this is that I had to take time off from
EQ for several months and I am now considerably lower in level than my
old hunting buddies and guild members. I am still interested in
keeping my skills up, but I need to level quickly so I can begin to
group again with most of my comrades.

Thanks again to those of you who suggested Paludal Caverns! What an
incredible place to level fast from 18 to 25!
