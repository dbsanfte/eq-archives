My guild has had designated days for Epic fights and pickup groups on 
off days.  I've been on three different epic 1.5/2.0 fights and a fourth 
  in Droga where basically I watched two rangers whip their spider (they 
get a special whip from a previous step that has to proc during the 
fight, so no help from non-whip equipped rangers, no ds, etc.)  On that 
fight, neither ranger's whip proc'd, the spider died (and spawned a mess 
of tiny wimpy little spiders), and they had to wait 90min for respawn.

The first actual fight (where my toons got hit) was the Monk 1.5 mob in 
Siren's Grotto.  This was before they fixed it so he regenerates, so 
even with 2.5 wipes (we started with him near his spawn point on the 
edge of the pool above the 'Well') we managed to finally finish him off 
with just one group (two two-boxers, a bard, and a rogue)  He was 
slowable, max hit just above 1500, and had quite a few hps.  Don't have 
the cleric sitting on engage, death is rapid once he goes KOS.  The WW 
zoneline is a pain, kill the wanderers and the two walrus that pop there 
before pulling him in, then just finish him fast.  I two box cleric and 
war and my friend two boxes druid and monk.

The second fight was the Mage 2.0 (?) elemental guy in the Grey.  He has 
a fun AE Gflux which caused mass adds on our first go with two full 
groups.  Second go with 18 or 20 people, positioning the mob against the 
rocks nearby to minimize the Gflux effect (lev didn't help) did the 
trick.  He hit for around 1k.  Most of the damage went to the MT but 
there was some collateral damage from the Gflux at 20-30 second 
intervals.  Overall a fun quick fight, barring wipe and recovery hehe.

The third fight was the Shaman's Shark in Lake Rathe.  The quest Barb 
wasn't up when we got there.  Killed the madman in his tent and she 
popped right after I exited my wide ogre self from the tent. 
Coincidence?  Or time of day perhaps...  AE proc was a long lasting 
spinning stun (bard didn't seem to be effective at stopping the cast) 
The AE also has a DoT effect which with one group was rather harsh. 
Shark at 3% when my cleric died, very close to oom.  Doesn't see invis, 
aggro range is medium, regenerates rapidly after everyone was dead 
(having learned to rebind just before these events, after SG, he was 
bound up on the hill behind the barb npc).  Second try with 14-16 people 
was overkill.  Max hit around 600-750 or thereabouts.
