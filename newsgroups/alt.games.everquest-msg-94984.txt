I went to www.everquestlive.com and spent about 2 minutes looking and 
found the following:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/eqlive/contact.jsp

and much, much more relevant to this discussion:

http://www.station.sony.com/services/everquest-contactgm.jhtml

I would recommend using the contact your GM page, and submit your report, 
including a link to the ezboard discussion you posted here.  I would also 
send the same information to eqmail@soe.sony.com.  I would be very, very 
suprised if you didn't get a response.
