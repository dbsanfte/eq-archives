You Still have a lot to learn about Druids - they're not just sow/port whore's.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes, it's better to make them now and learn from
them, than to be still making them in your 30's .

I don't know about an idiot guide but you might want to look up the FAQ (it was
posted at the start of the month), it has plenty of sites listed that you might
want to check out. Many of them have newbie guides that may give you some
understanding of tactics and class breakdowns that highlight 
strengths/weaknesses etc.
