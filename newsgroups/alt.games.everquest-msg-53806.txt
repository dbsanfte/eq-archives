If you come across a situation where you think they MIGHT need help, ask
them first.  If you come across a situation where there's a damned good
possibility they REALLY need help and don't have time to respond to your
question, go ahead & help.

For people who get bent out of shape about it and bitch at you just say:

"I was trying to help you, there's no reason for you to be an ass about it.
You are on ignore."   And yeah, USE the /ignore feature.
