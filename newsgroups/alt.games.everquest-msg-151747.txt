I have both the NetGear 4 port and the Linksys 4 port. Both are great routers
and easy to use....provided your cable company maintains their DHCP. Mine
didn't, then told me that if I could get on the net and look at webpages, there
is not a problem with their servers. I told them I was getting anywhere from 50
to 100 % packet loss, guy tells me, "Oh, the DHCP is behind a firewall."
duh...... anyway, both of mine are hardwire and work great. All reports I have
read tell me the wireless setups are very good, and as a previous poster noted,
10 ms is virtually unoticeable. Or something to that effect, anyway. Lotsa
folks here much more versed than I but this is from a layman POV. Regards all.
