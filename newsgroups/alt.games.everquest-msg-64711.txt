I am sure Verant employs a large testing department, and I am sure they did
find and fix many errors.

However, They can not possibly test every possible hardware configuration.
There is a virtually limitless possible combination of hardware and testing
all of them is just not possible.  Terefore they have the test server, where
things happen early and you can help them improve the game for your
particular configuration.  If there is a problem with your configuration and
you have gone on Test and given Verant feedback, it is possible that the
problem will be fixed before the changes go live.

It is a way of telling Verrant what you need to run the game.
