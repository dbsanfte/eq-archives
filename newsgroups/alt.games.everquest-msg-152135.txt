True, but you don't have to get so specific.  You *might* be able to
pull off their rating system idea by doing polls of certain spawns and
seeing what the different classes thought of it.  Or you could go
class specific and check different classes for their tactics in
different spots (although I'm starting to think maybe I shouldn't have
mentioned grouping off to the *side* of orc highway to so many people,
because the last few times I soloed there it was damn crowded and the
highway was completely empty - d'oh :p)

Mega.  Don't say giga if you phone them up, you'll give them a heart
attack :)  I think the best thing to do if you're really worried about
bandwidth, would be create the bare bones of the guide on one site,
then upload the specific pages to other pages and link to them there.
This could also allow you to organize - ie use account 1 for the bare
bones, account 2 for faydwer hunting, 3 for antonica, etc.

You *may* be able to find that info on their website.  Shaw's website
is the messiest, most user-unfriendly I've ever seen, so I've never
bothered digging deep enough to see, since I don't run any popular
websites.

I agree with whoever said that you should stick with plain old text.
It makes a *huge* difference, and a good guide shouldn't need fancy
graphics anyway :)

>Annie <--- Not sure she wants to put idea in their head, either.  

Ryou
(has found it's very difficult to get an idea into tech support's head
- like "yes you WILL get out here and fix this modem that likes to go
offline every hour on the hour instead of running me through the same
phone routine I've already gone through ten times")
