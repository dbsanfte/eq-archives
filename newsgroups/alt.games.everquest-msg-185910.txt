Unfortunately I used wolf form at the pirate snow cougar camp in Iceclad.
The gnomes did not like that and my corpse now lies there.  One of the
murderers stands near the corpse and a sentry patrols in the immediate area
too.  I recall reading at the beginning of Vellious that corpse recovery
reaggravates them.  Is this still true?  I guess if I wait long enough that
NPC will eventually return to his station.  You should know, that my faction
with these guys is good.  But what should I do?
