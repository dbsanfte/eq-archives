This is probably not new...

Aggroed a silverfur wolf in Nedaria. The wolf is in the river and
comes racing over to tell me what it thought of my actions. Meanwhile,
I am backing up to get some space.

Wolf tries to get out of the river only to pop back into the river. It
continues to try getting out of the river to get at me but it pops
back inside the river.

I attempt to cast on it and get the "out of range" message or the
casting spontaneously aborts (no message). I know the wolf made it out
of the river when the casting continues normally.

I should /bug that.
