    Someone recently ran a test that confirmed that. Go to any other non-Old
World zone, find a level 53 plus mob you can stand beside while Invis, Taunt
it. It aggros, invis drops when you get attacked, fight on. Now do the same
thing in Cazic Thule.

    Nothing happens.

    Apparently Taunt never used to work in the old world on mobs 53 plus,
and the current thinking is that this "feature" wasn't turned off in new CT.

    Those are the solutions others have been using, along with having
knights chain-cast high aggro spells. Doesn't sound very fun from what they,
and my guild, have described. (I missed CT night, darn it. No wipeout in the
old AoF room for me!)
