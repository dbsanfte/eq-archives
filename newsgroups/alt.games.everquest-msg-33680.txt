I saw Star Wars on the first run, but I was only 3.  In other words, I don't
remember a time when I hadn't already seen Star Wars.  I'm envious :)  I do
remember my first ESB and ROTJ viewings though.

Again, I'm envious :)  That's one of those scenes that's so famous, you can't
help but know it's coming even if you've never seen the movie.

I *never* read/watch/listen to movie reviews.  I don't even like seeing movie
trailers and ads.  I like reading Ebert's *after* I see the movie.  But that's
about it.  Well, I like reading Ebert's reviews of movies when he gives them
zero or 1/2 stars, those can be funny :)  Nobody seems to respect the first
time movie goer experience.  Just look at the DVD cover for the original
Planet of the Apes.  *sigh*
