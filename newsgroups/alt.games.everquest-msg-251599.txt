Normal ldon. Non uber guild tank (Knight, had about 8700hp fully
buffed). Me on my druid (65, 6 aa, ft12). Once I'd cast regen I
cast a total of 5 heals throughout the *entire* ldon. What on
earth would you have a cleric for if they're not willing to nuke?

A normal ldon just doesnt put out damage. A ranger could heal it.
