Im sure it is a completely different playing environment and am sure it is
great fun. On Ultima Online they had a PvP server where you could max out
your charachters skills right at the beginning and then go equip yourself
with the money provided in your bank.

You could then proceed to run about the town beating seven shades of hell
out of eachother.

I personally thought this was a much better PvP environment as it put
everyone on the same level except for raw skill (how all PvP should be) and
knowledge of the game. It also allowed the veteran players a a place to go
to vent their anger on newbies.

Ahhhh UO was a great concept ruined by poor graphics and lag.

:(
