I think you're right. That guy's description of the 3rd view isn't the case
for me either. It changes the angle of view but the camera remains still
when your char turns.

I really don't know which view to play this game in. At first I thought 1st
person, but that was after coming from FPS like Quake. After playing AC and
some DAoC i got use to the over the shoulder view. But that view sux in eq
because you can't pan camera left/right or even up/down very much. Also
clicking on things in the environment past your char is very frustrating.
Click an inch outside your char and you'll be examining your char rather
than the creature you clicked on. So I guess it's back to 1st person, if i
stay with this.
