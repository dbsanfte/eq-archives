This I agree on, as a matter of principal.  Regardless of whether I 
expect to be ML, I try to start every adventure, or even normal grouping, 
with no coinage.  Doesn't always happen, but I do try.  (Kind of a 
selfish reason - I like to know how much "money" my time has been worth 
for the evening.  And it is more work, but mot really that much.

(A couple days ago, I think we may have had a ML that forgot the part 
about subtracting your personal money from the group loot.  I watched the 
loot messages, and there wasn't that much that dropped that was worth a 
lot.  But when the split came, it was nearly TWICE what I was expecting.  
And EVERYONE in the group mentioned that it was outstanding.  Or maybe we 
just got more coin of the mobs than I guessed at.)
