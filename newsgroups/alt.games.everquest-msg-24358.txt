    People go to LoIO, and for all intents and purposes nothing drops there.
Just XP and coin. And the zone is filled every night. Why? XP. XP. It's ALL
about the XP. The KEEP OUT sign is for higher-level players. And with the
exception of the Prod campers and the Bloodgill hunters, they avoid Lake
like the plague.

>Add that to the remoteness of the area

    It's right next to druid and wizard portals, and there's bind spots
available in Paineel that just won't be bothered by guards. Not that a
character of the proper level couldn't enter the Warrens and smack their way
to Dubious with Heretics fast enough. Compare this with Lake - Lake is NOT
near a safe port point for a 15-30 character, it is a boat-only affair.  The
route between FV and Lake (for example) is patrolled by mobs one is always
KOS to, mobs which also use movement-reduction spells.

    Get a port to Tox. There is ONE spot you must run past to get there once
inside Paineel, and the truly dangerous NPC that can be there isn't there as
often as he once was. Once in the "pool" area outside The Warrens, bind,
smack dogs until Dubious, and never worry again. For those that want vendors
and a bank from the beginning, bind in Erudin until you get Heretics faction
up. I've adventured in The Warrens with a barbarian warrior, a half elf
warrior, an Erudite enchanter, and a human monk, all low levels. With the
exception of the Barb Warrior (who should be nicknamed "Wrong Way" anyways),
they all got past the guards fine and can now /hug the guards with impunity.

>and I think we're looking at another empty zone.

    If it were an indoors zone, I'd agree with you. But it's an outdoor
zone. It will become Druid Central once it opens if the pathing and XP are
even remotely good.
