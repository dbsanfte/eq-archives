Debating whether or not historical figures were "terrorists" is
amusing but nonproductive if people cannot agree on a definition
of terrorism.  As far as I have seen in this discussion, there
has been no agreed-upon definition proposed and accepted.  

If one merely means "killing with which I disagree," then
there are terroristic aspects to virtually all wars on
all sides.  

One common and definition is that a requirement for an act to be
"terrorism" is that it must have as a political goal the intimidation
of a populace by selective killing, torture, etc. of noncombatants.  In
other words, a terrorist event must have as a goal the intent to
instill terror in the victims as an end in iself, and not be a
byproduct.

The implication of this is interesting because it means that merely the
killing of noncombatants does not constitute terrorism -- it must be
part of a strategy of societal intimidation.  Thus, for instance, the
Battle of Britain was a terror campaign on the part of the Germans
because the purpose of targeting civilians was a failed attempt to
break the extremely resilient British spirit.  The bombing of civilians
was terrorist act because of the *purpose* of the attack. In contrast,
the Mai Lai massacre would not be a terrorist attack because it was a
spontaneous acting out of base hatred against civilians and not part of
a campaign of intimidation.  The Mai Lai massacre was certainly a war
crime and a crime against humanity; it was not, by this definition, a
terrorist act.

Using the American Revolution, the British use of the Cayuga and Seneca
Indians to attack and kill women and children in upper New York was a
terror campaign because the purpose of the campaign was to break the
spirit of the settlers on the Northwest frontier through attacks on
noncombatants.  After the defeat of the British/Loyalist forces at
Elmira in 1779, the Revolutionaries destroyed tens of Cayuga and Seneca
villages in retribution, accompanied by the deaths of many Indian women
and children.  Since this was done as retaliation rather than part of a
campaign to instill terror, it is technically not a "terrorist" action
by this definition.  Similarly, the Loyalist Southern campaign of
terror under Benedict Arnold, which presaged Sherman's March to the
Sea, was a terrorist act because the purpose was to instill terror in
noncombatants.

The distinction between the targeting of noncombatants in an effort to
instill terror and the killing of noncombatants as a byproduct of a
campaign is an uncomfortable one for supporters of the Palestinian
attacks on noncombatants, and they thus both adopt a broader definition
which applies the name "terrorist" to any killing of a noncombatant
in order to create a moral equivalency. 

This redefinition is convenient in the short term, because
it allows one to use loaded terms in verbal attack.  In the
long term, however, it is counterproductive because it either
removes any real meaning to the term or, even worse, it 
justifies attacks on the Palestinians.  If there is no distinction
between the targeting of civilians for the purpose of instilling
terror and the killing of civilians as a byproduct of campaign,
then it would be equally OK for the Israelis to target women and children
as it is for the Palestinians to do so.  The Palestinian
campaign of terror is self-contradictory in that it denies
this distinction when justifying its own acts but clings
to the distinction when attempting to dissuade the Israelis
from equivalent tactics.
