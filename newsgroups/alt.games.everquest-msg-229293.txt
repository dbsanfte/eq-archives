More Discord impressions.

Made a human ranger, starting in Surefall.  Killed fish to get to level 
two (took four or five fish), then went out to Qeynos Hills; the tunnel 
was not at all hard to see in, I could tell it was dark, but it wasn't 
the blind nightmare it used to be.  Hunted in QH, lots of blue to me 
mobs, and very little that hated me.  Tried something too hard for me 
and ended up dead (I forget just what).

Starting over, I grabbed a bard letter, looted my junk off my body 
(including second backpack), then ran to Qeynos, killing all the way, 
hit level 2 before arriving there.  Handed in note, then worked my way 
back, killing and ninja looting the many many mobs scattered around 
north qeynos newbie ground and the south end of QH.  Killed the rest of 
the way back up, sold my kit and had enough to buy a hunting bow and 
several stacks of arrows.  Range was pathetically short, but a lot more 
fun than running up to mobs and hitting them.  I kept at it, hit level 
3, doing the same up and down run.  Bought myself almost a full set of 
cloth armor off vendor, kept going.  I got almost no skill ups at all, 
the result I imagine of my descision to get stamina... my int and wis 
were well below 100, and I really only saw one or two skill ups in each 
skill the whole time.

Eventually I died due to going AFK in what looked like a reasonably safe 
spot...was I trained?  Or did something wander by?  Can't tell.

Tested something someone else said; I deleted my ranger and made a human 
necro with the same name.  Ran him out to QH (long run thru the 
Aqueducts, and I almost died when  mangy rat aggroed on me and hit me 
with a disease dot).  No body, which is a pity, had a couple plat and as 
I said, almost a full set of cloth armor, prize winning stuff on an 
utterly non twinked server like this.  Didn't actually play the necro at 
all, although I probably would have had the gear been there.

Later, I was fooling around with my FV mage when someone (fooboy?) 
showed up with a character on Discord.  I checked and when he was 
aminable to the suggestion, went to discord and made a character in the 
same zone; a wood elf druid to go with his half elf bard so we'd both 
start in kelethin.  Did a mail run, bought spells, fell to my death! 
Did another mail run with some hunting on the way, bought spells again, 
did more hunting, pulled a yellow mob back for the two of us to kill... 
and died, nearly killing my partner too.  Third time up, by now Teapray 
joined us with a ranger.  Who promply got killed.  A couple times.  Not 
that this was news to me as I'd died several times myself.  We played 
around for a while, I rapidly learned just how tiny and mana consuming 
my minor heal was in a group.  Eventually Tea had to long, then I ended 
up soloing for a while.  Hit level 3, level 4, then pulled a blue mob 
that was kicking my tail.  I ran for kelethin to do yet another mail run 
(had made many that day) and this time managed to forget to turn off 
attack... boom dead.

I don't plan to start again in Kelethin, the loot situation was 
abyssimal, all sorts of quest drops that nobody showed the slightest 
interest in, and that weren't vendor sellable; I probably made less than 
a twentieth what I did over the same 4 levels in the qeynos area.

GFay was also overcamped, at least around kelethin, and had the largest 
jerk contingent I've seen in the game; any time you'd pull a skellie 
with visible weapon or shield someone would come up and deliberately KS 
it, frequently they'd do this with any other mob.  Down in the Felwithe 
area of the zone people were a lot more civil.

I'm still not sure why I keep plugging away at the thing at all, other 
than still being curious about it.  As tea noted, I'm not really all 
that interested in the PvP aspect of it.  And the "hardcore" aspect is a 
pain.  But maybe it is the hardcore part that keeps bringing me back. 
death means so much more on discord than on any other server!  Now if I 
could just stop dying from stupidity...

Splendid
aka Littlejerk, probably about to be deleted so I can start something 
else on discord!
