Thanks to whomever did the work.  I've been borrowing an FBSS from a 
friend, and even using that I feel bad that I'm not carrying the AC that I 
could be in my waist slot since I was wearing a Forest Giant Hide Belt ( 
AC10 Str6 Sta3 MR3 CR3 ).  I definitely won't be using the FRSS when I give 
the FBSS back.

After I do lose the FBSS, what haste item makes the most sense for a level 
43 Warrior and full group ( 43-46 ) to go for?  Do the Frenzy camp for a 
while or is there another item that makes sense to kill for ( I won't be 
buying one )?
