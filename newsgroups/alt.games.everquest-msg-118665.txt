That's unlikely, IMO.   Level 3, in your example, would be from
501 to 1500 (as a guess.)   If you raise the upper level of your
current level, you either adjust all the following levels or you
risk the "he died 200 times in level 5 so his requirement for
level 7 will be met before he's level 6 or he'll 'Ding' 6 and 7 at
the same time"-type problems.   It's simply much cleaner to
ignore the level requirements when XP is lost.

Uh, no.  All you have to do is ignore the level requirement when
XP is lost and check to see if the person is already that level when
gaining XP.   Individual XP metrics are way too cumbersome and
inefficient.

Extra action is extra action, period.   If you don't delevel, you don't
need those types of checks.   It's not a question of how easy it is to
code;  code without those checks is inherently easier/safer/faster
than code with them.
