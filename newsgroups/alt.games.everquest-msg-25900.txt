Depends what it is you need. :)  But the actual probable answer to your
question is "no."

But if you lose your corpse and wish it were somehow possible for you to
find it for yourself (assuming you're not a necro or bard) then yeah, for a
few plat you can buy a corpse locate rod.

Or if you just WISH it were possible for your warrior to get invis without a
group, you can buy an invis potion from a vendor for 11-15p (depending on
faction/CHA).

Both of the above (plus lots more) can be bought from any NPC potion vendor.
