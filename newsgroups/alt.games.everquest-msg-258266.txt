*shrug*   Every Interstate Highway in Michigan has a posted minimum speed of
45 MPH.   (Maximum varies from 55 to 70, depending on urban - rural).   I
assumed minimum speeds were standard everywhere.

It rarely means anything, since obviously they're not going to give you a
ticket for driving too slow in a traffic jam.  But I guess it does make the
"too cautious" drivers aware that they're not supposed to impede traffic on
the freeway by "being safe" and going much slower.
