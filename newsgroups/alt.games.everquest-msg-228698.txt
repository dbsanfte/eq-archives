Well - look at it from the PoV of the mages - we weren't told about
this change that will have a massive impact on many mages.  We discovered
it by ourselves and were then told nothing more than "Well, we don't
think it's right this should work like this."  Why?  Where is it 
overpowered?  In what context does it trivialize content?  These 
questions were never addressed.  It makes us wonder if they ever 
looked at pet-canni in operation, or just threw some numbers at the
whiteboard and said "OH WOW, That's not good"

Rytan then posted on the board with a (pretty acurate) numerical comparison
of mana regen rates.  But these assumed the mage was actively 
canni-petting, during which he can do nothing else.  No pet up, no
nukes, nothing.  Averaging the net canni-pet gain in a regular session
out over the entire session (rather than the brief time you actually
CP) yields net gains of 20 mana per tick, approx.  At no time did
they demonstrate where we were overpowered with the ability.  In fact,
most mages believe that our complete lack of defense and low utility
argue for us being one of the top DPS classes in the game.  A position
that we achieve with this mechanism.  So, not only do many believe
we weren't overpowered with it, but that we will be underpowered w/o
it.

I'm personally unhappy with the level of communication this represents
on Brenlo's part.  I'm not about to go around calling him names, but
I really believe we should have been given the same consideration as bards
when they're about to drastically change a 5 year old game mechanic.
