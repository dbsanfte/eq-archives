... don't ask me how I got ahold of it, because it's everywhere. If
you're interested in it, you already have it, so here's a rundown of
my thoughts.

Everything generally looks alright, however I'm still not a big fan of
the art style of everything. The characters don't look particularly
natural to me. Let's break it down with the only races I bothered to
try.

High elves: okay, not bad. By biggest qualm is that they've had a foot
or two completely lopped off. The hair options seem generally decent,
with various different designs and even some "classic" styles.

Dark elves: dissapointed, dissapointed, dissapointed. Those that
worried that they wouldn't be able to have the classic "blue tone" of
EQ, those fears are gone. You can have exactly as blue as in EQ, even
moreso if you like. So why am I so dissapointed? The hair styles are
incredibly lame for the dark elves; the females especially. Almost
every single one is with their hair up, I can count on my hand how
many there are with hair down (my favorite EQ hairstyle was the
snake-fang hairdo). Extreme lack of short-haired options for female
noticed.

How did it run, you might ask? Well, choppy. I'm running a P4 2.52
GHz, 1 GB DDR RAM, GeForce 4 Ti4200 (a bit of a bottleneck, I admit),
and the character creation screen alone chugged along when I tried to
rotate it. It reminded me of looking straight foward in the Bazaar
with the clip pane at half.

More as I explore it.
