There is a category listed "trader name" or something like that.

I have no experience with this particular way of looking, as I couldn't possibly care less who is
selling item X, or what items player Y has, I want to know what items are out there that my Troll Shaman
can use that have HP on them, or something along those lines.

I really wish the "effects" listing could be pinned down further, at least so far as I II or III so I
don't have to search thru a hundred level I focus items looking for the odd II one.   And I'd dearly
love to see a -not- function added to the search so I could leave out spells or things like that that
really clog up a search.
