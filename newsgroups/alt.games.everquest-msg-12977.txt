When I'm bored, I'll get into a debate with beggars over the meaning
of the word "need". "newbie shouts, "need buffs at tunnel, plx!"".
"/ooc You "need" food, air, water, and such. You "WANT" buffs. Get it
right, nimwit".

I'm strange, I guess. I've done corpse runs from FP to NK without SOW.
I've gotta a necro to lvl 30 with only the occasional drive-by buffs
from druids/etc - never asked for a single one. I hunt with my
non-druids quite regularly without SOW and do quite well. I must be an
incredible player, given the fact so many others think they "need"
these things to play...
