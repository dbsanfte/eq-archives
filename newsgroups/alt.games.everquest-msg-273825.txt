Come on, give us a break. This is the same weak ass arguement one of my
kids might give me for trying to get away with cursing....

"...But Dad...Fag is just a bundle of sticks... It says so right here in
the dictionary. ", said the immature teenager.

"Yes, and ass is just a donkey, but you and I both know you weren't
calling your brother a bundle of sticks or a donkey. You're still
grounded." said Dad.

The context that the word is used in is EVERYTHING and it's obvious from
your own email to Blizzard that you, yourself, posted that you were in
violation of the TOS.

Grow up and get over it.

Todd
