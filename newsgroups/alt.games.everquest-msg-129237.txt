None of these qualifies as stupid. Perhaps demanding, even
unreasonable, but not stupid.

Not stupid either.

Merriam-Webster defines dumb as "lacking the power of speech". This
would be a serious detriment in my line of work.

I'm sure I must have met at least one stupid person in my life, but I
can't think of a specific instance. For the most part, on an
individual basis, people are generally intelligent, reasonable, and
rational. There are, of couse, exceptions.

It's groups of people that are stupid, not individuals.
