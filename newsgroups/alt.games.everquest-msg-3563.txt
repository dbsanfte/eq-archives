Interestingly enough... that's exactly what I did with my Rogue. ;)

He was born in Freeport (I went with Half Elf cuz they're sexay, and he's a
swashbuckler romantic type), I ran over to RV, got a bind, stayed there till
I was 12, went over to WC and roleplayed my way to 15 fighting Wisps and
Kodiaks. :)

Roleplaying my way... I mean by I flirted with all the female druids at the
Druid ring, and they always gave me buffs. ;)

Au Revoir,
