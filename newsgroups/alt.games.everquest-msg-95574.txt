Yes, you wasted your points, but don't worry about it. I have almost
100 training points saved up at level 52 and nothing to spend them on.

As a rule only put 1 point into melee skills. They will raise fast
enough as you level. The only skills you might want to pump extra
points into are Mend, Feign Death(17), and Instill Doubt(18). These
three skills work best with a skill level above 100.

>Are all of these kick things upgrades or new additional skills ?  So whats the point in 
>training in them other than a seed point perhaps?

The only skill that "might" be worth keeping up is Dragon Punch. It is
used in one of the Disciplines you get post 50. Otherwise go with the
skill that does the most damage with the shortest recycle rate. Once
you get Flying Kick (30 or 35..can't remember offhand) you will use it
more than any other special attack.

>Is there a good monkey website - monkey-business or something I vaguely recall?

www.monkly-business.com

>Finally , I started the sash quests , the orange one, can I use any lego bracer 
>(eg one from crushbone) or does it have to come from a WC lego ?

The bracer drop is extremely rare from the WC legos. I took a trip to
crushbone to get mine, and the quest worked just fine.
