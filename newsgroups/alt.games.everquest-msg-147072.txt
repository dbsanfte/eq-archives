Hooo yeah, that's so true.   "Yeah, Mr. Raid Leader, it's not 'about the
experience.'  Sure, ok...but why does it always happen that YOU are in Team
KS?"

And even if he is not usually in Team KS that group is almost always
comprised of the same people...or more specifically NOT comprised of certain
classes...so what's their incentive to keep going back again and again and
again only to lose experience EVERY time....

My guild is excellent when it comes to whining...we don't do it.  Ok, not
that much...maybe 2 people say something demoralizing, and they immediately
get a tell asking them to stop it.  But still....

But still...we're getting to the point where we see how multi-MTs are a Good
Idea (we're not a raid guild...we don't know stuff raid guilds have known
for a year or two :p ) and since Hate appears to be royally screwed up we're
likely to create 4 self-contained groups to take down as many as 4
run-of-the-mill critters at once.
