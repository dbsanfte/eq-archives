As far as I know, you always appear while trading (or while looting a
corpse, so be careful while mouse panning around the Cazic Thule
throne room while naked and looking for your corpse...).  I would
suggest getting a druid friend to wolf form you to do your turn ins.
Check your faction from a distance, just to be on the safe side, but I
did this with my troll and it worked swimmingly.
