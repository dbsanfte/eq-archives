Heh. Well, the fundemental difference between cable and satellite is
most satellite subscribers OWNS their equipment. Most cable
subscribers rent from the cable company. Most customers can't seem to
get that concept. In the case of rental customers, yeah, DTV will send
out a free service call, as long as the problem wasn't
customer-caused. All others, they're gonna charge money to fix YOUR
equipment. They're not getting that rental charge out of the customer
who owns their equipment, and they're not getting the equipment back
when the customer cancels the account.

Best comparison I try to give people who also have Internet service is
to ask them if their ISP sends out a tech for free to fix their
computer if it crashes...

Anyway... It's $60 +parts and labor for a 1-time truck roll. It's
$59.90, parts and labor included, plus a one-year service commitment
for a protection plan that covers service calls for a full year. ;-)

That said...I prefer cable, really. A thunderstorm doesn't knock out
cable as easily as it does satellite (I've heard of people modifying
one of those old 18-foot dishes to work with a DTV receiver... Those
things get signal through a hurricane just about. ;-) ). Plus, fewer
"access card" issues and no dish to worry about getting bumped by the
neighborhood kids throwing balls around...and no need to get
permission fromt he apt manager to set up a dish.
