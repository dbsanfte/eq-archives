Is it mana free?  Cause if not, I don't really see how its going to be
faster than click click click on a ten second pulse.  I can click a
whole group up faster than I can med back mana from a single
rez.

Wiped 25 people on Klandicar a couple days ago.  Rezed them all,
all by myself. Took less than five minutes, just told them all there would
be no "are you ready; so DONT go afk till you get your rez" and wandered
thru clicking every body.  With multiple clicky clerics, its even faster,
we divide up the bodies by general area and click like mad, if we see
a little overlap its no big deal, no mana spent anyway.

If you want to upgrade rez in the new "every cleric has a click stick"
environment, you need to combine it with a CHeal and make it
less expensive than that CHeal... since the person brought back in
will be unbuffed, 3/4ths the time a real CHeal is a waste of mana.

A friend of mine just hit 56, someone said "woot, 96% rez" and
we just laughed... he's had 96% rez for more than a week now,
all this does for him is let him rez people while his body is still
missing.  Course the addition of Yaulp V and the new summoned
hammer were the truly exciting turning points at that level...

Bergh "ooh,  a rez I have to spend mana on?  Sign me up.... not" Brelltender

Hmm, thought of another way to make a new rez attractive.  Higher
exp returned.  This would really piss me off though, since it would mean
I might as well destroy the epic entirely, as its outclassed as a weapon by
the summoned hammer you have to spend 6pp on at a vendor... I keep
it in a bag now and haul it out whenever I see dead people.
