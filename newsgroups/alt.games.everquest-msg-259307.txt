Well I would like to see a little more info with people using at least 
similar AC values. Though from personal experience the BST at 1400 AC seems 
pretty low, since mine at level 51 is at 1100 AC with self bufs. (A little 
twinked but nothing like I would assume time gear should do)
I am assuming the tests where the same guard, so there was no level changes 
etc. Maybe do this a little more controlled vs. a caster's pet in a duel or 
just a duel vs. a level 65.

Course I am not volunteering to take the time to do this, and I applaud the 
person who did the test, just suggesting alternatives :)
