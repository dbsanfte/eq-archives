They should be very soloable by a 59 Druid.  They are snareable and
rootable.  They are social but you can usually get singles or doubles.
 They hit for around 100 - 150 and proc a somewhat damaging DoT.  Most
don't see invis but there are a few spiders that do.  Also, some of
the spiders themselves are invisible, so /con everything if you decide
to move up and keep see invis on.

It's also very likely that you will find some melee soloing in here
for shits and giggles, who has no interest in the threads...
