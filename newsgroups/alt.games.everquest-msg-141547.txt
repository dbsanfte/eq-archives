You can't really compare prices across classes.  When something is specific
to a class, you have to compare to the other alternatives available to that
class.

This is similar to why the price for various stat boosts depends on what
slot they are in.  A horrible neck stat boost might be a fantastic stat
boost for an range slot item.
