Let's take those suggestions one at a time ....

1) Group.  In a group setting (if I can find a group at all, which is rare),
seems like my druid's lot in life is to bestow wolf form, a few small buffs,
and taxi/evac service.  ~yawn~  I could group with my guild, but I only have
a couple of hours max at a time ... their just getting organized and I have
to camp (dang RL anyway).

2) Make friends.  In most of the zones the mobs I can hunt are found, people
don't seem to care for a lot of /ooc chatter.  You get told to shut up, or
ignored completely.  Unless you take /roleplay off, then you have all kinds
of friends.  "Buff/SoW/Port me plz".

Oh, or there's always the "There's no more room <on cyclops island/at the
spirocs/at the forest giant fort in Burning Wood>" conversations that
usually end up with some teenager who thinks his dick is as long as his
toon's level challenging me to a duel over a spawn point ... no thanks.

3) Join a guild.  In a guild, as mentioned in an earlier post.  Have been
for over a year now.

4) Start challenging yourself.  Again, that seems to consist of "Can I
root/dot that seafury at 47" or "Can I quad those spiroc provens without
getting backstabbed to death".

After reading the various replies, I'm beginning to think that it may be
more of a druid thing than at post-45 thing.

Just got the SK to 12.  Let's see how it goes this time.  As an ogre, I'm
hunting in places that were a bit inaccessible to my druid at a comparable
lvl, and plan to take him to the Overthere and points beyond rather than the
Oasis => SK pathway to 30 which I've done sooooo many times now.
