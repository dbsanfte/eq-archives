Theres no real reason other than cost, to not go back and revisit old 
quests/items though. And at $13/mo x 400,000 they could surely put a 
couple people on it part time...

The obvious solution to mudflation is to simply add at the top. EQ 
unfortunately can't do that for two reasons... 1) they've got technical 
issues with perpetually raising the level limits and caps etc... and 2) 
they've got financial reasons to 'convince' people not at the endgame to 
upgrade.

A *much* better solution to mudflation is to integrate the old 
quests/items into the expansions. Don't let the better items just drop 
off new mobs in the expansions... instead add reagents and quests to get 
those old weapons upgraded. That old world quested mace is total garbage 
by the standards set 4 expansions later... but its an absolutely 
critical piece, along with a sarnak claw from Kunark to get that 
kunark-expansion mace... which is itself a critical peice along the way 
to that nifty velious mace... which is the prime component to get that 
uber Pop or Luclin item... hell you could even have some uber pop item 
be made up of half a dozen old world quests, kunark quests, velious 
quests... and of course a number of drops from the planes.

A side benefit of this is that old world zones wouldn't get abandoned, 
and items from the old world would still be marketable...old world 
factions would be relevant again, and young guilds could work on the 
older quests, while they gear up, and come up with items they can 
eventually use for something useful...  ubers can spend time in the old 
world(s) working on these quests while they're lfg ... without it being 
a waste of their time.

In my experience people don't mind doing long quests, with junky 
intermediate items, they just don't like doing pointless ones of any 
length with a complete piece of junk at the end.

And from an economics point of view: quests that end up with uber items 
will be popular... and if you need all the previous expansions to do the 
quest nobody over at SOE is goign to shed a tear ... what better 
incentive to buy that missing velious or kunark...

Sure some folks might complain about "having to go back to the old 
world"... but I think a lot of people would find it refreshing to 'slum 
around' in lower guk or solb etc for a couple hours questing some item 
needed for a PoP quest...

I dunno... maybe im out to lunch on this one...
