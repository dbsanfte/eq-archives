Thanks for the info.  I just like the idea of a Necro having REALLY
CRAPPY CHA.  Not really roleplaying but I figure if they put CHA
minuses on things its gotta be for a reason.

And yes shopping does suck.

ME is challenging but will try it.  I find that my pet is a waste
there.  The traps are a real drag too.  I will try the area south of
the lake.
