I find safety in the fact that this vehicle has never been on a safety
issues list.  That every crash comparison done with "SUV's" never
includes this one.  That every recall and warning issued does not
include mine.  Size definitely helps when it comes to vehicles, I
don't think anyone will argue that.  After all, if it didn't why would
so many people be pissed that so many large vehicles are on the road
making it less safe fot those not in the large vehicles?

As for you, I never worry.  I either win or lose.  I rarely lose.
