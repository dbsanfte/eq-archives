Here is what a poster on Allakhazam's site had to say:

"Here is what you do after you get the coin. Give it back to Fabien then he
will give you a note and tells you to deliver it to Dionna, she is in S.
Qeynos. Dionna will then give a Placeholder Scroll- Effect: minor healing
ALL ALL. I haven't used it yet, came here to post my findings, so I'm not
sure if it has unlimited charges. But if there is more to this quest Dionna
did not give any indication, considering what is involved the scroll is
pretty worthless so hopefully there is more to this."

I haven't tried it out yet so I don't know if it's accurate.
