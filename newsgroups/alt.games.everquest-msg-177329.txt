Well that's just a brilliant idea.  Let's see, OT?  Nope, empty.  DSP?  
Couple of groups and many many PLers.  Echo?  Nobody my level.  SK?  
Empty.  Splitpaw?  Either empty or druid-filled.  Hmmm... looks like 
it's back to HHK.  Even having a guild group, at 33 I'm still going back 
there out of desperation for the levels so I can continue on with my 
life.

And /agree Ben.  I loathe the idiots who take over the entire zone for 
PLing purposes.
