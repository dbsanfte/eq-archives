So how exactly does making a point of expressing your inability to
accept others who may be different fit into an event designed to
increase acceptance of others who may be different?  I guess if you are
part of the crackpot right it is considered a show respect for those who
may be different by telling them  you don't like them.   Unless you
believed that the others in attendance might have benefited from the
opportunity to show tolerance for her intolerance?? Well since you
consider faux news and JAG to be good sources of  information regarding
the world around you it shouldn't come as a shock that your views are so
silly.

Maybe you should go back to pretending not to hear what I say, when you
try to form an actual reply it only makes things harder on you.
