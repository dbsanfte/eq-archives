I have been reading this newsgroup for several weeks now, and have found it
to be an invaluable source of information as well as entertainment.  This is
my first post, so be gentle.........

First, I must warn you that this story will NOT entail the slaying of
Dragons, crushing of Hill Giants, or obtaining that oh-so-rare piece of uber
armor.  Lately, my level 8 half-elf ranger (Solst, on Zeb) has been hunting
in Kaladim. Goblins, giant snakes, whatever I could track that conned dark
blue.  Level 9 has been very slow in coming.  I did try the grouping in
Crushbone experience, but felt cramped and out of place with this character.
The wide open spaces lend themselves much better to honing my archery
skills, so I have been concentrating my efforts in Kaladim.  I promised
myself I wouldn't stay on long last night, since sleep is required to
actually function in RL, and lately I have been pushing the limits.  But I
was sooooo close, only 1/2 bubble away from level 9.  I could see that blue
mana bar filling in my mind, enabling my ranger to overwhelm his opponents
with deadly combinations of slashing, kicking, and magical flames. Snaring
yellow conn's and pumping them with arrows as I ran backwards, watching
their HP drop like stock prices.... umm ....oh yeah... the story.  Ahem.

I decided I was getting no where quick and would head back to Greater
Faydark and camp next to orc lift and force myself to go through the
Crushbone experience just so I could hit level 9 faster.  On my way I track
a Goblin, conn's blue,  okay - I take him out.  Drops my HP 1 bubble, but it
will be back up before I get to the orc lift.  I spot a giant bat, conn's
blue, I take him out.  Drops my HP another bubble, so I'm down by 2, but
again I think I'll be okay.  I notice my experience bar has actually moved!
I can't see any reason why I didn't ding, there is absolutely no more room
on that bar!  I'm almost to the zone line when I spot a skellie on tracking
that conn's blue to me.  This is it!  I'm hitting nine tonight!  I'm only
down 2 bubbles, this skellie should only drop me 1-2 more at the worst,
right?  Target, start firing arrows, okay.... start firing arrows....WHAT?
Shoot! I'm out.  That's okay, so I slip up behind him and kick him and
activate auto attack. I get decent hits in and he turns to engage me.
Whack! insidious cackle, I'm stunned.  Meanwhile he keeps hitting me.  Okay
I can move again, back off and kick. 1H slash is NOT landing.  My HP is
dropping too fast, and this BLUE skellie is laughing at me.  I finally start
to land some hits, but I fear it is too little, too late.  I have 1 bubble
left and if I am seeing it correctly this walking heap of dried out bone
marrow, still has twice that if not more.  I'm backing away, trying to head
towards the zone line.  I think I'm close but can't turn, for fear his hits
on my back would just finish me off sooner.  I was so close...

Then, I spot someone on the edge of my peripheral vision.  I type /yell
hoping for assistance.  I have him down past 50%, I should at least get some
experience.  No one comes....

I am now down to less than half of one bubble, but the skellie is not far
behind.  Between getting stunned and finally getting some hits in , I have
made some progress.  I decide to hold my ground.  I may lose this battle due
to poor judgement, but not due to sheer cowardice.

It is so close now, my heart rate has to be pushing 150.   I get one more
kick and slash combo in and DING!  I can start breathing again.  I can't
remember when I've had so much fun.

/grin Why looky here, what is that strange blue bar filling below my HP?

Needless to say, I did not go to bed. I had to go buy all my spells didn't
I?  And I definitely needed to fletch more arrows.  Just a little side note,
for the first time ever I am picking up brownies on my tracking.  Is this
due to having mana now?  Had to kill a couple just to see how tough they
were.  What do you do with brownie parts? Bake them?

All in all, a very fun night.  Got to level 9, bought and memmed my spells,
got my fletching skill up to 56, and tried out the snare/kite ranger
technique.

Again, I'm sorry my first post has been so long.  I know it's not as
exciting as the epic quest tales, or plane raids, but it was personally a
very satisfying experience that I just had to share with someone.  Thanks
for listening!
