Aye, "spellin' weird" ain't roleplayin', but what it *be* is a method
o' conveyin' an accent.  I've 3 main characters, an' each one o' t'
wee buggers "speaks" in a completely different accent.

/Say, /Tell an' t' like be spoken, aye, which be why PLZ an' it's ilk
be wrong; nobody says "plz" oot loud (unless they be daft buggers).

By usin' differentiated spellin' ye convey t' differences o' t'
characters.  Each character says things in a different manner, an' by
spellin' 'em different, ye gi'e t' "listener" a different way o'
hearin' t' words.


Reyder, him tok like dat 'cuz him Dwarf.  Me toks like dis 'cuz me god
diffrunt mouf.  Take a look ad Ogre mouf sumday, yuuz seez dem fangs?
Well, dem make id perdy hard ta say da "th" sound.  Ogres nod all dat
smart cuz a' da curse, bud we knows whud we doin'.  Barshin' fings.
