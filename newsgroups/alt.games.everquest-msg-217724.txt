Yup Clarity's available on many old world merchants.
According to castersrealm its in:

  	
Ak`Anon Casters Guild
Erudin Palace Ench Guild
Felwithe Casters Guild
Freeport Casters Guild
Neriak Casters Guild
Qeynos Casters Guild

Not that ive personally verified it, but it sounds about right.

Breeze, is indeed a Kunark era spell, but was mostly just a leg up for 
lowbies. By the time Breeze came out the trade in Clarity was 
established, and since its just a 29th level spell it wasn't hard to 
find an enc able to cast it. The small number of encs between 16 and 29 
use breeze on themselves and groupmates, but theres never really been a 
market for it.
