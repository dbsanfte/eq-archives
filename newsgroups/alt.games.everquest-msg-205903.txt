Hi guys, I've been lurking on the list for a while now and I was wondering
if someone could either post a list of current market prices, or a link to
where this info is.  I don't have SoL so I can't go to the Bazaar, but I've
tried to buy a few things from players and the prices seem just ridiculous
(HQ bear pelt for 40-70p).  I play on Tholuxe Paelles, but I'll settle for
any info out there.

Thanks
