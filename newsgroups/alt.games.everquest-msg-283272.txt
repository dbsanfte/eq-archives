I've seen a "padded cell" firsthand, several years ago; there was an 
event in Qeynos where they were trying to do something or other (maybe 
it was the addition of Paineel?  I don't remember) and several of us 
were making nuisances of ourselves, which seemed "in character" but 
which also, at least in my case, was partly stemming from the 
outlandishly bad lag occaisioned by what seemed like several hundred 
players cramming into a single old world zone.

At any rate, I was never sure exactly what I'd done to warrant it, but 
my character was ported into a small room with no exits, in a different 
zone so I wasn't on the same OOC/Shout channel as everyone else.

Not being a gate class, nor armed with the now classic thurg gate potion 
or other means of getting a melee out of a zone, I wasn't able to tell 
if such would have been possible.  I was able to communicate via guild 
chat, and tells, but was in an otherwise empty zone so no "local" 
communications worked at all.

Lasted about 10 minutes, till they finally got done with their setup, or 
gave up on it, GM events often don't go the way the GM's intend...

Anyway, I was dumped back in a crowed Qeynos uncerimoniously, never did 
get any communication about what I'd done or why, never saw any 
consequences afterwards.

7 logged in days in that box?  I'd have long since stopped paying for 
the account, particularly if I never got any communication with my "jailors"

10 minutes, on the other hand, well that was pretty much amusing!
