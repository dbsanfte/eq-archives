> Hi all,

<snip>

Dwarves have the strength, so upgrade to small bronze.  You're perfect for
Unrest where small bronze drops.

You're about at the level where you can start some of the cleric quest armor
in Solusek Ro, though the platinum bars will cost you some cash.  At that
point I suggest Cazic Thule.  Folks commonly disregard old world zones but
that's because you'll only see old-school alts and p-levelled twinks there
<G>.  You'll get nice cash and fine steel weapons there.

Once you have some money, start swapping out some AC items for wis items as
your need dictates. <--this is sound advice for mid-lvl clerics so all you
AC freaks please don't bother replying....been there, done that, etc.
