}: You know, if you get enough of those (and those AoL CDs) you can tack them
}: up on a wall and make a realy neat mirror.  Friend in college interned at
}: MS and brought back scores of useless CD's and did that to a whole wall 
}: in his dorm room.  Very neat effect.
}If you hang the CDs on the outer ridge of the tacks, you can achieve a neat
}ripple effect.

"You can also add an elegant 'cracked' look to the CDs by microwaving them 
for a few seconds first."
