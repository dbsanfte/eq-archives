No. The powergamer will only need to whack a few dozen mobs before he 
finds or buys an upgrade. The casual gamer will probably go through 
hundreds of mobs before an upgrade opportunity shows up. Hell, my Druid 
has been in Elysian for the best part of two years now.

The difference between casuals and powergamers is not a linear one of 
time invested, but a curve. Powergamers have better tactics, are more 
likely to be keyed for better zones, have a closer circle of people to 
group with, etc.
