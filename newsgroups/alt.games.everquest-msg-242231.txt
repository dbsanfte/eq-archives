What should the next playable race be?

Ottermen	(Good?)

Aviark		(Neutral)
Centaur		(Neutral)

Orc		(Evil)
Gnoll		(Evil)
Kobold		(Evil)
Goblin		(Evil)
Minataur	(Evil)
Grimlings	(Evil)
Lizard Men	(Evil)

Undead		(Evil)

Other?

Personally I'd like to see some more evil races. The Orc model in LDoN
looks nice, so that could be a good one to add. I think my favorite
one would be Gnoll. An evil race that could be.. say, maybe Wizard,
Cleric, and Shaman. That'd be fun.
