/rant on...Why do a lot of people think that others "owe" them something?  I
mean, I usually help out when I can, for example if just sitting around in
chat, I usually don't mind gating someone somewhere...but if I am medding to
regain mana so that "I" might be able to get back to "my" game, why am I
expected to use the mana that I just spent ten minutes medding for to help
someone else and then have to med 10 more minutes before I can play and help
myself?  If people want rezzes and ports, why don't they play clerics and
druids?  I personally see it as equivalent as me saying to a tank..."Let me
port you over to X, kill X for me to ensure I get the experience and loot,
and then I'll port you back.  The tank gets nothing, loses 10 minutes or
more of game time, and may need to sit around and heal before they can play
again.  (Although I would be kind enough to heal/buff them before dropping
them back off)..../rant off
