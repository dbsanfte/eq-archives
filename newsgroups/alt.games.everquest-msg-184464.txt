Easy as pie.
Go to www.eqwindows.com - download and install the software.  The first time
you start the program, you will need to browse and find your Everquest.exe
file (or is it EQGame.exe -  EQWindows should direct you to the right file).
Start EQWindows and logon with your first account.  Press Ctrl-Alt-R to
release your mouse from the first EQ session and  start EQWindows again and
login with your second account.  I'd suggest that you turn off Luclin models
when logging in to do the transfers, the second session will load a lot
faster.  Once the second session has loaded up, press Alt-Tab to go back to
the first session and press Ctrl-Alt-R for that session to "recapture" the
mouse.  Now you can easily alt-tab between sessions.  That's it.

When I first started, I had EQ in two separate directories and an EQWindows
icon that pointed to each Everquest.exe file.  I found out that I didn't
need to have two separate EQ directories, so you don't need to copy your
current Everquest directory to a new one.  Note, a lot of things you have
defined for the characters on the account that you normally played on the
other computer are not going to be there, i.e. macros, hotkeys, window
locations (I think).
