Only by items, but you can gain a max of 10 more wis from alt
advancement xp in the 50's. 

Essentially by picking a half elf, you were automatically 20 wis lower
than the two highest druids (hafling and wood elf both with a max of
115) You are in fact 15 lower than a human, who only has a problem
with not having infravision (of course wolf form awlays has
ultravision.. and spirit of EAGLE has infra and you get it at 54 in
fungus grove as a drop)

Druids have no advantage outside of high wisdom as a class. All their
other stats are plenty high enough on any of the races at the default.
So wis is it.

If you are okay with having 20 less wis than wood elves or halflings,
you are fine. Right now my wood elf druid has some pretty fantastic
stuff like its epic 20 wis, lodizal shield 10 wis, talisman of
benevolance 15 wis etc. At level 56 I have 242 wis. If I had not
screwed up and only got wis to 110 (did not know about wis being the
only thing we need and threw away five points on dex, idiot) I'd now
have 247 wis. Is that going to make a huge difference? No, but do I
miss the 5 wis? yes. 255 is now the max wis to have to help you, I'll
probably still just reach it but you will have more trouble. In the
same gear that I have you'd only have 227 wis (assuming you maxxed
your wis to 95.. which I hope you did as a half elf for sure)

Assuming you maxxed your wis, a druid or halfling with max wis would
have 124 wis instead of 104 in your same gear. 

Knowing what I know now, if my wood elf druid was level 20 or under
I'd have restarted it so I could have my wis 5 points higher. If you
are level 20 or under I'd sure restart the half elf  as some other
class (wood elf or halfling, with MAX wis)  while a friend holds your
stuff.

FYI: They are elminating hell levels and making xp from level 1 - 10
much faster, as well as having you pop up in full equipment from level
1 - 10. In case you don't know, that means:

1) Starting over you'd level much faster once those changes are in, up
to level 10. This would give you a large boost in getting back to
where you were.

2) Once the change went through, your friend could give your level 1
halfling or wood elf your old druids stuff and you'd be assured of not
losing it because if you die you pop up at bind point with all your
stuff (once the changes go through)

Like I said, i'd seriously consider it if under level 20, especially
after the changes.
