"Scumsucker" seems to be a generic term used when a mob is not
programmed with table of race names, or something to that effect.
Before a recent patch, many dubious merchants would call my Iksar a
"scumsucker" when denying service.  Later after the patch, I was
referred to as an Iksar with the same rude denouncement.
