Missed a word.  "pick it up on a shelf"

I can't see why you think you need to debate preordering. 

When the game comes out the stores will have a zillion copies. Plenty 
for everyone who wants one within the first couple weeks. And even in 
the unlikely case that everywhere sells out, you can be assured their 
are plenty more on the way.

You can see how others fare with their systems, and buy it or not 
depending on the results/reports.

You hardly need to 'reserve a copy now' in order to even have a shot of 
getting the game if you later decide you want it. Its a mass produced 
video game, not an exclusive restaurant reservation.

This game is going to run for years, you won't be missing much if you 
miss the first couple lag ridden days as everyone churns around in the 
newbie yards.

Give it six months post launch. :)
