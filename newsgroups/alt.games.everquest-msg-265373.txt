Yeah, that fits what I've seen, too. I have a trait that gave me Gnoll 
Mastery Smite, which is what I would have received from the Mastery quests 
previously, and I've heard people complaining that they can't buy the quest 
books anymore. Sounds like they're migrating Mastery from a quest to a 
snowflake trait.
