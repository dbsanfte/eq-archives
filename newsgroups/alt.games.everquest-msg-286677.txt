Yep, I am.  Not one mention of it here, not one in general chat or in 
guild chatter on combine.   I get up in the morning, look at my trader 
who I've left logged in overnight, and they're spamming MOTD with the 
time and expected duration of the patch.

Am I shocked?  No, I'm not.

But am I forewarned?  No I'm not.

And thats really not my point.  Yes, if I cared enough to dig enough, I 
could find out, at least a little in advance.

My point is that the simple obvious channels for communticating these 
things are not used for doing so.

If they don't want the Updates button to lead to information about 
Updates, they should just take it down.

Its like I wander in to work, and there in front of me is a huge board 
with a sign over it saying VITAL INFO ABOUT YOUR JOB TODAY HERE and 
there's nothing, but if I wander over to the restroom and check on the 
third stall on the left, hey, there's the info... not written by some 
disgruntled employee leaking secrets, no its the official word from the 
boss, thats just where he puts the info.

Its sloppy.  Even if I happen to know the process, that doesn't make the 
process good.
