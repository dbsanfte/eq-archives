Good point.  If they give away weak items as promotional stuff to
entice more players, I have no problem with that.  Heck, I bought
the boxed LDON partly in order to get the in-game WR bag.

I'd only get torqued if they started giving away "good" items for
money.  "This week only, get a Cloak of Flames for only $100..."
