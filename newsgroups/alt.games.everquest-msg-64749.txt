7200 rpm drivers aren't needed for EQ.  They make a difference if you
capturing data from a digital camcorder but otherwise the bottlenecks on the
computer are the video card and cpu. Unless you have top equipment in both
cases, the faster harddrive is a waste.  Also 7200 drives run faster and
have a higher failure rate (due to the heat).  I believe there are 10,000
rpm drivers now. Of course the faster speed assumes an ata100 or at the
least an ata66 interface.
