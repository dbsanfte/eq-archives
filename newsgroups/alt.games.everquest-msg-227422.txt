You base this on what, a religious conviction?  If its anything but a 
gut feeling, you should be able to discuss the matter.

I laid out what I think are -reasons- why the system doesn't make sense, 
and even ones why I think it -seems- to make sense.

If you disagree, why?  Where did I go wrong?  Construct a similar thesis 
statement showing how it does work.  Or at least go thru and counter my 
statements on a point by point basis.

Show how NBG works to benefit the person who will go to any camp for any 
reason, and groups with randomly selected people most of which you'll 
never see again.

Show how it -isn't- subject to manipulation by anyone who is selfish 
enough to only hit targets where loot for then drops, or

I think this is overstated, there are quite a few people here who favor 
NBG.  But this is a fairly thought oriented newsgroup, I'd expect a 
larger proportion of them to have thought things thru and see the same 
thing I'm talking about; how NBG can really just be an excuse to pick 
your pockets.

Maybe someone claimed that, but I don't.  I think this idea is fairly 
radical, the opposite of how 95% of people in the game play.  NBG is 
quite common, I agree.  And even those who dont' care for it seldom say 
so, because there's no nice way to say so, and most people want to seem 
nice.

IF you don't want NBG, you must be greedy.  Who wants that?  And of 
course, to some extent its even true.  The only reason to object is that 
you want your fair share of the loot, instead of letting it line the 
pockets of the less scrupulous.  Wanting loot is greedy!

Ever go to a camp where nothing you can use drops?  Ever notice some guy 
you've grouped with several times, but Only at camps where things drop 
he might use?

Ever turn down an item because you have better, only to see someone else 
in the group take it on a NBG basis... even though you suspect they too 
have better?

Are you really glad NBG is the rule of the land?

If I was unable to see what was happening, blissfully ignorant, I would 
be.  Or if I was assudiously applying the same selfish tricks myself, I 
certainly would be.  But since I -can- see it, and don't want to be 
deceitful or duplicatous, I don't like it.  I usually put up with it, 
because I'd rather get robbed than make a fuss over loot, but I don't 
like it, and I'd love to see the public attitude about it change.

ps: again, this applies to pickup grouping in a large pool of players, 
more so than in a small pool, or a guild, or a regular group.  When you 
see the same people again and again, and can determine that they aren't 
taking you to the cleaners by abusing the NBG concept, its a fine idea 
that benefits everyone; much better to see items and spells go to 
someone who you'll group with, so you get the benefits, than sell them 
to strangers where you'll never see them again.
