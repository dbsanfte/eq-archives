Okay, spent the evening buying all but one of the parts for my newbie
Ogre warrior armour. Well, it has only just made level 10. Everything
was in Oggok except a "piece of giant bat fur - Grok says tuft", which I
purchased in The Ferrot (oh, plus 2 orange lizard scales). Stuff is just
literally almost everywhere in Oggok and The Ferrott.

Does anyone know where to find pristine spider(ling?) silk 

All up, I think it took less than 5pp. As I was doing some selling and
buying of various crafted stuff, I lost track.
