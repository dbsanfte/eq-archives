Well said.

There is a sizeable faction (a society, if you will) in the US who
think that *I* am evil, because I believe in a goddess rather than
their god, and practice witchcraft.

Not by me. I don't agree with what they did, and I would have given my
own life to stop them, but I understand their motivations. They saw us
as evil, and believed they would be rewarded in heaven for striking
us. I can't fault them for that. I can, however, insist that we crush
anyone involved into dust to ensure that it doesn't happen again.

Morality doesn't come into that debate - it's simple self interest.

Yeah, like training Osama to be a terrorist. It sucks when the
chickens come home to roost.
