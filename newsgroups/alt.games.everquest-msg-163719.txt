Up to level 60.  I haven't researched the new PoP spells yet cuz I'm a mere 
lowbie 56. :)

}The idea, as explained to me, was that people prefer VoG/SoV to WR because of

}from a haste standpoint.
}Combining WR with SoV means you get both the highest haste and the most useful
}buff effects.

If that's true, that's very cool.

}Apparantly this was done deliberately

It would be consistent with how other hastes reportedly stack.

}> Anyway haste doesnt stack.. and you only need a 35ish % haste item for VoG
}> to be totally effective

VoG is 58% haste.  If we assume that haste caps at 100% for the subject in 
question, 100-58 is 42.  now 42 is arguably 35ish, but there just ain't any 
42% haste items...

}WR is often referred to in my guild as "cleric haste" because I'm supposedly
}the only guy meleeing without a 35%+ haste item.  In fact, though, many of the
}other melee in the guild are also using 22 or 26% items.  SO just as I ask
}tanks what their AC is before deciding whether to drop an AC buff on them, a
}chanter could ask what people's item haste % is.

Well, I went around and inspected all the guild melees and decided that WR 
was a happy thing.  Well, especially since I can't cast VoG yet. :)
