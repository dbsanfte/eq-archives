Hi there!

I am new at EQ having a level 11 Barbarian Warrior in Halas, so forgive me
if the questions seem trivial to you.
I have had some luck joining various groups at times enjoying the sights at
Blackburrow.
1.
However I just can't seem to find a decent 1H blade, my bastard sword 8 dmg
seems fairly weak and will harvest 18 at most - how do I get my hands on a
more powerful weapon?
I have tried South Quenos and Halas merchants, but without any luck.
2.
I have gotten hold of the Blackburrow Brewers cask, I have read that it has
some value to rogues - what should I do with it / charge for it?
3.
My warrior is constantly poor - any ideas for earning pp?
