I think this whole angle is waste of energy. Why should anyone be
motivated to "share risk" with a port customer? This is not an equal
relationship. The portee is the one asking for a service. The porter
is not going around randomly asking people for plat and offering to
port people in exchange.

Anytime some portee started trying this angle with me, I'd just say
"not interested, go find another porter". You'd be amazed at the
number of portees that suddenly found they actually did trust me
enough to pay in advance.

Of course, this was on the PvP server, where just about everybody
wants to empty their pockets before porting anyway. Never know when
some PK is gonna take your cash, and port spires used to be a popular
PK camp spot.
