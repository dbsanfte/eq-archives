Not to flame or anything, but problem is that Microsoft states you can't
just easilly uninstall DirectX. Not only that, but assuming you had no
trouble in doing so, the minimum you need now is DX8, which I just
(yesterday) downloaded DX8.1, the newest version on the site.
    Would any other ideas work? I'm not having this problem but am curious
as to what it is (though as I also mentioned, what about DX8 having done
something to the way that the software communicates with the modem, or even
what about EQ now having trouble communicating, after all, ISA is pretty old
and nearly extinct, though I still like the old ISA SB16 sound cards as a
cheap yet good sound system).
