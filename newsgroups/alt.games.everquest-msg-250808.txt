I think you miss my point.  I wasn't suggesting that the difficulty of 
changing the engine (or of any other given thing they might do to the 
game) would be different due to its being an MMOG.  Rather, I meant to 
suggest that the reward per difficulty factor would be a lot higher with 
EQ than it would with an old school game.  Rather than provide an 
upgrade path from Fork In Your Eye to Fork In Your Eye II, they just 
wrote a whole new game in the same "world", same basic game style and so 
forth, and called it good.  Worked because people had tired of FIYE, and 
its couple of expansions, and the game was by then years old in tech 
terms.  With EQ, though, you have a base of people who spend cash every 
month just to keep playing... so maybe its worth the extra effort needed 
to upgrade rather than start over.

Sounds icky.  Also sounds like the sort of thing that would be 
impossible to not notice when running the changes on Test.  What would

Well of course its not, the time to try and change what is happening 
there would have been a couple years ago when EQ2 was first put in the 
pipeline.  I was just thinking about things in a theoretical way, with 
possible applications to the future of MMOG gaming, and possibly in the 
future evolution of EQ... but didn't mean to imply that we could hope to 
stop the EQ2 juggernaut at this late date.

Calling something EQ2, if what it really is is EQ lite only with better 
engine, seems to me a really scatterbrained idea.  The 2 part realy 
makes it sound like a sequel, rather than a substitute or prequel.

If that's the plan, then A) they shouldn't have called it EQ2, B) you're 
thinking people will go from a shiny new engine to the old kludgy one 
for the environment?   Sounds like now they need to update the EQ engine 
more than ever, since they won't be bringing in people that don't know 
better!

A player should certainly outgrow any given zone.  Instancing ala LDoN 
was an answer to that problem, but to me that destroys the sense of a 
world that was so strong before LDoN.  I like instancing for what it can 
do in terms of giving me access to content without having to fight with 
all the other players... but it still makes the game into more of a... 
well, game.  I particularly dislike the very feature you mention, where 
the zones are based on the level of the group hitting the zone.  Talk 
about creating a treadmill!  Not to mention that level is hardly an 
indicator of relative power; different class combinations, equipment 
levels, and strategic abilities meant that one group of all level 30s 
might be Half the killing machine that a second group of all level 30s.

What I'm complaining about, though, is that Everyone has outgrown most 
of the old world zones.  Its not that my level 20 character no longer 
wants to do Blackburrow... he's supposed to not want to go there 
anymore, he should have already moved on to higher level content. 
Rather, its that no new level 7 characters want to go there either.  And 
as you level up, this problem becomes more and more the case.  There are 
hundreds of zones that rarely see more than a couple lone wolves or the 
odd group of nostalgia freaks (or true adventurers or true clueless 
newbies).  Zones that were once crowded, even overcrowded.  Why? 
Because there are now other zones that offer easier experience, better 
loot, are easier to get to... and because there are no compelling 
reasons to go to those old zones.

Nope, as you observe, the point isn't to make Velious stuff more 
interesting to Velious era players (it was plenty interesting back then) 
but rather to make it interesting to modern players.  Given the effort 
required to make your velious armors, I'm suggesting that they should be 
brought in line with what that sort of effort would produce today... but 
that would be too easy, so instead, make them a first step in a quest 
that produces better armor or something of that ilk.  I understand that 
one of the complaints with doing this is they want everyone to be able 
to use everything in a given expansion with only original game plus that 
expansion.  But A) it would be possible to do it that way, by making 
part of each quest take place in the Old World (say, in your home city, 
for example).  or B) it wouldn't be necessary to make it work that way 
because you aren't offering this as an expansion, you are upgrading old 
content with this.   And C) so what, it sells more Boxes if people 
decide to buy old expansions in order to be able to do some of the 
updated old content.  And D) I was at any rate particularly thinking of 
upgrading real old content, the original game zones, more than the 
expansion zones.... although upgrading the unused expansion zones would 
add even more of the same improvement to the game, in terms of masses of 
currently unused content.

Sounds to me like their failure to use Test as a... well, Test... might 
have been a large part of the problem.  But thats just a guess, since I 
wasn't in the game or seeing much of what was being said at that time.
