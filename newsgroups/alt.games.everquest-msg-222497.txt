My level 49 cleric gets KEI before heading out on a mission.  I would probably
be fine without it while playing with my regular friends, (who single pull and
mez the adds and can give me regular clarity).  Mages and wizards often don't. 
I've only been LOM when I get in a group that insists on "offtanking" mobs,
(and then I'm often OOM, not just LOM).
