With all of the emphasis on quality levels, failure is relegated to a fairly 
rare and obscure result, and not even the worst result. If your green 
durability bar manages to hit 0% before the blue progress bar has completed, 
OR, you hit the Stop button before any quality level has been achieved 
(i.e., before the blue bar hits its first tick), then your combine is 
treated as a failure and you get a message indicating that the combine 
failed and that your ingredients were preserved, but fuel used for the 
combine was expended.

Every tradeskill device requires fuel to operate. For the Workbench 
(Jewelry) and Forge (Blacksmithing) the fuel is coal; for the Engraving Desk 
(Spells) the fuel is incense; for the Chemisty table (Alchemy) the fuel is a 
candle; for the Sawhorse (Woodworking) the fuel is sandpaper; and for the 
Loom (Tailoring) the fuel is a filament. In addition to the specific 
ingredients required for any given recipe, there will always be a fuel 
requirement. The only place I know of to obtain fuel is the merchants inside 
the tradeskill instance, who sell it for very nominal prices (6c each). I'd 
be pretty pissed if my combine failed and I lost that rare item required for 
the combine, or the pristine component that I'd worked ridiculously hard to 
create, so losing only the fuel on a failure is a decent result. In fact, 
it's often a better result than winding up with a crude final item that 
actually completes and therefore uses up your components. This introduces a 
new tactic: if you're not happy with the progress of a key combine and 
you're still early enough in the combine that you haven't yet achieved *any* 
quality level (i.e., before the blue bar has hit its first tick) you can 
simply hit the Stop button, kiss goodbye one recipe's worth of fuel, and 
restart the combine. If you do achieve any quality level and subsequently 
hit the Stop button, the combine will result in completion at the highest 
level of quality achieved before the Stop button was hit.

This allows you to choose between a couple of tactical approaches to 
grinding. On the one hand you can speedily rush through a series of crude 
combines that will complete very fast and get you minimal experience at a 
higher component cost. On the other hand, you could instead choose to 
attempt to bring every single combine to its highest level of quality and 
thus obtain greater experience from the final result (remember, the amount 
of experience awarded is linked to the final quality level achieved), but at 
a cost of more time. Basically it's the same tradeoff as you face between 
hunting low con mobs vs. high con mobs.

In practice, involuntary failures (meaning ones where I really struggled to 
complete and still lost) have happened to me maybe 10 times in all the 
hundreds of combines that I've done in 35 levels of crafting. Some times 
I've had failures simply because I was just grinding and wasn't really 
worried too much about preserving vendor purchased components, I just wanted 
the experience of a completed combine and hadn't been using my tradeskill 
buffs. Usually, if you're using your tradeskill buffs intelligently and 
you're really focusing on completing the combine, you should almost always 
be able to avoid a failure. But a random bad streak can occur, even if very 
rarely.
