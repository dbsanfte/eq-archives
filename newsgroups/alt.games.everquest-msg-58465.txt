In addition to the other suggestions you've gotten, you could find a
partner and go to Ocean of Tears and hunt Gargoyles for a couple levels.
(Save the eyes. Great money and they stack.) 
Also, could go to highpass and get in an orc group until your faction
with the Highpass guards get's good enough to get you into Highkeep. You
could make it to level 30 there in the basement no problem.
I'm told that some people can get into some forest giant grops around
level 20 in Kunark, but I never did that so I'm not sure. Something to
check into, though.
