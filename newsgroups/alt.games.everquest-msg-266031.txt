No, sorry, the environment doesn't work that way. If a Democratic 
administration passes a ban on logging on old-growth forests, the next 
Republican administration changes it back, the logging companies clear-
cut as many of those forests at they can get their hands on, then the 
Democrats get elected back. Guess what? Those forests aren't coming back. 
Same goes for all the species that go extinct in the meantime, and for 
all the filth dumped into rivers - a change of administration won't 
bring it back.

Still, as far as leftists go, I'm not particularly radical on 
environmental matters... probably because living in the UK, it's hard 
for me to conceive climate change as anything other than a good thing. :)

Fortunately, the judges' job is not to decide whether something is 
popular, but whether something is legal, or whether a law is 
constitutional. So, regardless of how many people believe God Hates Fags (
and how popular a pastime crotch-sniffing has become) discriminating 
against them is illegal, and that's something that people, even if they 
number over 51%, will have to learn to live with. Or else, obviously, 
vote for someone who will enshrine that discrimination in the 
Constitution, as has happened.
