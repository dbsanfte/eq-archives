This your first forray into MMORPG's? What you describe is not exactly an 
abberation, especially in the first week after launch. I suggest dealing 
with it or moving on, because foaming at the mouth at this point is a bit 
premature.

I've heard of EO, but not enough to make me think it's any kind of miracle 
of online gaming. Compare total downtime after a month. If EQ2 has 
substantially more than 30 hours of it (compared to EO's hour every day), 
then you might have some reason to complain.

It looks *nothing* like NWN. I don't know where you're coming from with 
that.
