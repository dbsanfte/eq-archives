I should have put the DD vs Summoned line on my "useless" list.  It isn't
completely worthless, but I rarely hunt summoned mobs, even more
rarely -exclusively- summoned as opposed to a mix.  Add to this the
fact that I'm rarely main nuke, and in fact often don't mem any nuke
at all, and you get a rare^2 situation.  Then when you consider that I'm
doing 516 with retribution, as opposed to 220 with sound of force
or 261 with expel summoned, you really have to wonder.

Hmm, did a little calculator work
Expel Summoned: 130 mana, 261 damage = 2.007 damage per mana
Sound of Force: 120 mana 220 damage1.8333333 damage per mana
Retribution: 240 mana 516 damage = 2.15 damage per mana

Discounting the (quite valuable) stun effect, sound of force is the
least efficient damage producer of the trio, as well as doing the
least actual damage per shot.

Just as a lark
Wrath: 145 mana, 218 damage = 1.503 damage per mana
lol, pitiful even in comparison to Sound.
Banish Undead: 225 mana, 585 damage = 2.6 damage per mana
Winnnna and new champeen!

Unfortunately I do not.  I have a large number of friends that
I group with regularly, in fairly random combinations.  Don't
do "real" pickup grouping with strangers much anymore, but
have retained the challenges of "what is the best plan with
this combination of characters" thinking.

If I had to pick my most frequent grouping it would be
Cleric, Wizard, Paladin.  Hardly the most efficient
group in the world, but friendship has to count for
something, and it is pretty functional.  I pull in, begin
chain stun on arrival, while paladin starts taunting and
engages.  Once the wizard gets shackles on, paladin
stuns while I stick fear.  Wizard drops in a nuke or
two to speed things up, I do a little stunning to keep
the fleeing mob closer to our spot, and soon its dead.
Since I've used the least mana, I run off to pull while
the pally Hats up and the wizard meds.  If things go
awry we have 3 people with roots, two people with
heals (yes paladin heals is a joke, except that LOH
works fine on the "only in emergencies" level of need
for a healer), 3 people with stuns, and one Evac.

Another frequent group is Cleric, Ranger, Druid, Warrior.
Ranger pulls, druid dots, I keep celestial running on
the ranger and the warrior complains about being unable
to taunt off him while I gripe about not being allowed
to fear indoors.  Why this group tends to do indoor
work when its -clearly- better suited to outdoors is
a mystery to me.  Res the ranger, repeat.  OK, its not
that bad, but you do have to question why rangers, the
"tank" with the worst AC, have the best taunt.  Even
not taunting, even using an inefficient two hander, with
the poor warrior doing everything he can, I'm still healing
the ranger.  Rangers aren't tanks... but how to keep em
from getting all the love?
