I hadn't even thought about that!  That would be really bad, if some boneheaded
melee, like a beastlord or something, were to grab aggro after the cleric
started a CH...  :)

Now, this I don't understand.  If we assume the DPS is similar, do I want to
hit for, say, 30 points every 1 second or for 180 points every 6 seconds.  I
understand that aggro decays with time.  In that case, I would expect the 30/1
second to generate less aggro at the end of 6 seconds, since some of that
damage has expired in the mob's memory.  On the other hand, the 180 hit might
as well be a nuker saying "hurt me, please!" :)  Does this scenario win out
because the tank has 6 seconds to grab aggro back before my next swat?  Or is
there something else I don't get?

I found that out the hard way...  I backed off from one fight and let Binky
handle it while I tossed a few heals and maybe a nuke or something.  I assume
that if I had left my warder's taunt off then I would not have shaken aggro by
moving out of range.  Is this right, or does the mob just swat whoever is
nearby?  I guess this would mean either that aggro decays with range or that my
warder was higher on the hate list, but the mob attacked me anyway because I
had the big pink "PC" triangle on my head. :)  Come to think of it, the second
seems more likely.  I haven't parsed it, but I'd bet that Binky outdamages me,
with all his procs.
