It's time to make a major move in life.

Head to Lake Of Ill Omen in Kunark. Its quiet a scary trip, but if you
can make your way to Oasis you can catch the boat to Fironia Vie.

Once there either ask for directions or get a guide (remember to bind)
Its only one zone over but the path to FV is littered with nasty 30ish
spiders. With a camo and sow you should be fine tho.

Once you hit the lake do the usual shout for a group and start
killing. There is a vendor in the windmill (SE of zone) you can sell
to but remember to buy lots of supplies in FV.

Once you are at home in the zone you can level comfortably to about
lvl 29 with relative ease. And you will be in hot demand, since it is
an outdoor area.
