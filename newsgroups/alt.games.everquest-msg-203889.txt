Allow me to add two items.

1)  You won't always be MA, especially when you start multi-group raiding.
When you're not MA, you're supposed to be helping dish out damage without
getting aggro.  High-damage, slow-swinging 2handers help.

2)  Some mobs riposte very, very frequently, and when they go into Rampage
the riposte every successful hit.  Slow weapons don't swing as often, thus
don't get riposted as often - and so cut down on the damage you're taking.
