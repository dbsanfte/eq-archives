Once again:  The mobs there require you to be within melee range to
cast on.  I've watched level 50+ casters blow entire manabars, even
after being told this.  They don't have especially high MR IF you are
within melee range.  There are a good number of high-level mobs with
this restriction.  I have never seen a mob that resists EVERYTHING,
though I'm sure they are out there.  Within about two minutes we
figured out that you had to be within melee range, it wasn't too
difficult.  We also shared that information with the zone, but really,
if you're level 55, especially as an enchanter (i.e. not an outdoor
only, soloer), you should know that certain mobs require melee range.
