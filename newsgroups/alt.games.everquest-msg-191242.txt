I would guess that serveral servers are involved in getting email to a ship:
your machine sends to your ISP's SMTP server, which then sends the message
to some Navy SMTP server, which determines what more specific Navy server to
send it to, and so on, until it gets to whatever server can actually deliver
right to your friend's mailbox.

So, the first question is, which server is bouncing the mail?  If any of
those intermediate servers cannot get to the next server for some reason, it
will bounce the mail.  Note that this would have nothing to do with whether
or not your friend's mailbox still works.

I'd not be at all surprised to find that ships stop receiving mail for
security reasons at various times during war.

You should be able to tell from the bounce message if it was an intermediate
server that bounced the message or not.

I doubt that they would rush to turn off email accounts of dead sailors.
That would give families and friends a hint about casualties before official
notice could be delivered, which they would not want to allow.

I wouldn't worry too much about it right now, if I were you, beyond the
general worry of having a friend in war.  I'm actually kind of amazed that
they even get personal email on military ships at sea, so the fact that it
might break down now and then doesn't seem a cause for concern.
