Apologies for jumping to Google; seems @Home's mail servers have given
up the ghost ahead of schedule.

Ever since it was "fixed" to "properly" use your bow's base damage,
Trueshot might produce some spectacular max hits, but it doesn't do
much, if anything, for your average.
And before you go there, no, using a high-delay bow does not help. 
Testing has shown that Trueshot damage correlates to ratio, not delay.
