Does anyone know why they haven't added an icon for this song?  Personally,
I'm sick and tired of people screaming for me to play mana song because they
don't see "Your mind clears" in the middle of all the battle spam.  On top
of this, being a bard, it's almost impossible to type a response back amid
all the twisting.
I stepped into Karnor's for the first time today (a tad scary at level 44 I
think) and the 2 casters were bitching even though I keep the song up
constantly in a 4 song twist.  "It's up almost constantly" I say, with
responses of "Oh yeah, DOH!" and bullshit like that, only to have them
repeat it again.  This is my highest level character and I'm still surprized
at how many people don't know this by this level (they were all high 40-low
50), or what a Bard can do for that matter.
Of course I'll keep slogging it out regardless.  The place seems a little
crazy, trains and all.  Funny.  I was there for almost 1/2 hour with no
signs of trains, thinking "I don't know why all the fuss over trains in
Karnor...maybe people on this server seem to know how to handle the place"
when is see /shout TRAIN!
It was an enormous, almost beautiful train.  I think it about emptied the
zone, hehe.

Sean...
