At 57, I think the warriors will remain mostly dark blue while the casters
will remain light blue.  At 59 they are almost all light blue.  I went
farming them for a little plat at 61 or 62 and they were mostly green with
an occasional light blue.  At 64, I would imagine someone would find the odd
gnoll that was light blue, but they would be hard to come by.  The exception
is Barducks Darkpaw, but he's a load to solo and I'm not sure of his respawn
time.
