Arrows are used by Warriors as a pulling tool you will have to stand back
out of Melee range and shoot arrows. Very expensive and very time comsumming
to raise archery. Also I don't think a group would be too happy with you if
you stand back and shoot arrouws for 20 points damage with a delay of 50
