I'd been using a Belkin KVM and I liked it fine but got to use a Linksys at
work and just liked the look better (not quality...quality was fine on both)
and the switching option so went with that instead.

I bought an older version but the new one I like even better...BUILT IN
CORDS!  Very nice for $37.
