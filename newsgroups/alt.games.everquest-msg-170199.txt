Eye of the Beholder, I know these characters are always the Stereotype (I
guess JRR made created that stereotype) she was beautiful, even for an elf.
He was gruff, even for a dwarf. He was big even for a troll...etc but I
think Cate and Liv were great castings as elves, no I don't find them that
attractive but I do think the both have an elvish look about them.
Eowyn, well I wouldn't climb over her and I much prefer the natural look of
humans have incomparison to the made up, great hair day, Elves...Did you
know Stuart Townsend (Lestat from QoTD) was originally cast as Aragorn but
only lasted 5 days on set. Hated it, apparently.

Agree, who cares? Besides it works well for elves, who have always been
portrayed as effeminate even xXx Legolas is a little bit on light footed
side. Yes, irl, Sir Ian Mckellan is gay, came out in the 80's I think,
during a radio or tv interview.

Best performance, imo, was Andy Serkis as Gollum, helped by some of the best
character CGI I have seen In the Fellowship I would have given that to Sean
Astin.
Legolas doesn't dominate the fight scenes so much, which should reduce the
amount of 1st level Rangers coming out, wonder if Gimli's bigger role will
bring about spate of Dwarven Warriors (all called Gimli but with half a
dozen repeated letters) Think I preferred Gandalf the Grey to Gandalf the
White (He's gone all Uber and almost gotten a l33t attitude with it) all in
all in an excellent 3hrs spent at the cinema, you know when a film is good
when you are hoping it will go on that little bit longer.

At least it is *only* another year till the 3rd part and not 3 like
StarWars, not that I really care to much for part 3 of Star Wars, I doubt it
will be given the treatment it needs.
