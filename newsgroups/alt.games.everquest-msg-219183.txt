The answer is right here in something you quoted me saying.  To
show what I'm talking about, a 20/40 weapon with 20% haste would
be the same thing as a 20/32 weapon... but if you get a 40% haste
item it would jump up only to a 20/19 weapon, while a "real"
20/32 weapon would jump up to 20/15... or for that matter, would
benefit from a different 20% haste item worn elsewhere on your
body, making it a 20/25 weapon effectively.

Combining haste with a weapon is very limiting.  People tend to
realize this, though, and even to overcompensate for it, so
you'll sometimes see weapons like the mithril two hander going
for less than a comperable ratio (with the haste figured in)
weapon.  If the haste on the weapon is similar to a haste on a
non weapon item, this even makes sense; better to keep using a
cheap weapon with the same ratio as the hasted one and buy the
haste item instead with the cash, then when you can afford a
better ratio weapon you will be able to upgrade to it; further it
will give you more flexibility, as you can use all your different
weapon skills to keep them capped, and situationally use two
weapons or one weapon or weapon and shield, and also use proccing
weapons when needed, all with the haste running.

This isn't to say a hasted weapon can't be a bargain, sometimes
the ratio you end up with is going to be far better than anything
you can set up with a haste item plus unhasted weapon at a given
point in your budget.  IN the long run I think everyone ends up
using non weapon haste except for a couple classes who's epics
have other very desirable effects and a 41% haste, which makes
them the ultimate offhand weapon.  But never having played a
melee up to anywhere near the end game levels, I can't really say
for sure.
