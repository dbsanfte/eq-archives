You are forgetting everyone who started in beta 4 before anyone had the
slightest idea of what any of the clases did except for what verant told us
i.e. shamans are the healers for the evil races and the barbarians of the
north, druids are the healers for the elves who live among the trees. Druids
at the beginning where RARE . Then in the midpoint there was a druid on
every corner due largely to gross misinformation. Now they are all but gone.
Incidently the choice for my original character was made because a rl friend
was playing a shaman and we didnt want to overlap.
