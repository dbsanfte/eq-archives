Most bartenders and rogues in most cities are more knowledgeable about 
their fellow citizens... odds are there is *somebody* that knows what 
groups the guards of freeport like and don't like (*and how much*) 
without making me kill one (or 1000).

Most good rpg games have internal mechanisms to learn about thinks like 
faction...

That would be a nice addition. There are some issues... like how to 
handle conflicts...does the mob just average the different factions when 
he looks at you? Ie if he hates you because you've killed his brother 
460 times (er beat him unconscious 460 times... yeah that it... just 
beat him unconscious), but loves you because you killed 500 gnolls, his 
home city's hated enemy... how does he react...?? lukewarm? forgive and 
forget? still murderous??

I'd probably shoot for a floor function... 'he likes you as little as 
possible'. It seems most realistic to me. ie...I don't care how many 
Kobolds you killed...you murdered fifty Wood Elves...

"You have ruined your own lands... you'll not ruin mine!!!"
