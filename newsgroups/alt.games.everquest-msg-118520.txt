My wife & I run 2 accounts through 1 56k modem. Tried ICS, result very 
flaky, hangs, discons etc...

Tried both winproxy & Sygate to provide NAT & all is well.  We both hit 
60 the other day so it has worked for us. :)

Setup can handle zoning at the same time, zoning separately it does 
cause lag over the shared connection. So its good not to let one 
character die :P

Performance degrades as you go on larger raids, I'd say the upper limit 
is at about 7 groups.  At this point you start getting lag/high ping.

Its not an ideal setup but as you are getting cable then it should serve 
you well til then.

We have no problems with everyday grouping/xp'ing & have done HoT, 
Vindi, planes/dragon raids with this setup.

www.sygate.com
www.winproxy.com
both available on trial.

suck it & see :)
