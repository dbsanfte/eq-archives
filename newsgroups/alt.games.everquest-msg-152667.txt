/agree, but...

Problems occur when the player-vendor has limited cash (Paying 90000 for
Fngi, but only has 300 left after all other purchases).   Inventory is full
after buying 80 spiderling silks and someone else wants to sell to the p-v.
I think there may be too many issues w/ not enough cash, full inventories,
etc. to make it practical.  Would be nice, though.
