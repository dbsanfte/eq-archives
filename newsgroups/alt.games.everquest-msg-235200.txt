Hehe!

I went to The Warrens the other evening for a quiet bit of levelling 
with my 20th Cleric. As it's usually empty and gives good exp. and 
faction for a couple of the quieter cities.

When I arrive it was mayhem. Kobolds going everywhere. a /Who showed a 
4th Dwarf Beserker,  a 59th level character, an Anon character and a 
21st level enchanter.

Then the chanter started on about someone had killed everything that 
moved and quite a few things that hadn't.

When the 5th level Beserker goes by the Paineel entrance with the 59th 
in tow.

So I assume they are what the enchanter is on about. So head the other 
way.

To find total devastation. Pile upon pile of bodies. As I round a corner 
my chat window blurs with sheer blizzard of XXXX does 264 points of 
non-melee damage to (Every Kobold in the Place?)

This is followed by a stampede of the few surviving Kobolds all with a 
couple HP tearing by me.

The Enchanter is now getting quite upset. So I hazard a guess it wasn't 
the 6th level Beserker and his colleague who were the one she was 
complaining about.

So I decide that as the wounded were bound to bring back friends It's 
time to leave.

A wasted journey. So I left the 7th level Dwarf Beserker and all.

It was the first time I had seen real POWER LEVELLING! the Dwarf went 
from 4th to 7th in under half an hour.

It was also the first time I had seen a faction fixing killing spree in 
full swing.

( See Thread "An Economic reality that should irritate socialists (that 
Everquest is proving once again" )

Seemed to me if there was ever a reason to keep a tight rein on the 
availability of high level gear and spells. This was a good example to 
keep the restrictions.
