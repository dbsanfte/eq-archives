Humm thats a good point.

What I'm guessing is that SoE implemented it differently than they 
described it.

I think they described it as "the 6th member is free" to incourage 5 man 
grps taking a 6th man. I'm guessing that what they actually did was make 
the bonus for a 6man group be 116%.

Then in a group of 10,11,12,13,14,15 they gain xp as follows :

Orriginal mob xp = 1000 (this is what a soloer of any level would get)
Group adjusted xp = 2160 (this is what will be split between the group)

Each player then gets a multiplier depending on level :

TotalXp * ((Level + 5) /(Total levels +(party size * 5)))

Lev10 = (2160) * ((15) / (105) ) = 309xp
Lev11 = 329xp
Lev12 = 350xp
Lev13 = 370xp
Lev14 = 391xp
Lev15 = 411xp

Then that xp gets modified again due to level smothing and the like.

As a quick comparisen here is a 5 man group dropping the level 15

Lev10 = 318
Lev11 = 339
Lev12 = 360
Lev13 = 381
Lev14 = 402

Humm they all get more xp :-/

Lets drop the level 10 instead

Lev11 = 320
Lev12 = 340
Lev13 = 360
Lev14 = 380
Lev15 = 400

Humm now they get less xp each vs the 6 man grp.

Looks like it is best to add a low leveler as your 6th man.
Unless SoE have managed to do what they described and make the xp for the 
6th man just appear rather than using a multiplyer.
