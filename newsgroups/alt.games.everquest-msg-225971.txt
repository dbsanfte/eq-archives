My ranger is 50, and all I can really do is echo the others.  Dumping aggro
at your level is damn difficult unless you have a SK as your MT.

Make sure you don't kick or taunt, no spells (I normally don't snare until
the mob is at 25%, and if it's a high DPS group I don't snare at all),
remove any haste items you might have on you (I only wore my FBSS to solo).

Or .... and let me say up front that I hate this option .... let someone
else pull.  Be there for DPS and to peel mobs off of the casters, and let
let someone else take the first shot.  Have the puller follow you while you
track, then let them get aggro and drag the mob back to your group.  The
viability of that option depends on your group make-up, as you don't want to
leave your casters unattended.
