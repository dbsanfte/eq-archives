    Yep, it is a bug I suffer from sometime too. Seems to happen to me after
I use the sit hotkey, and then use another hotkey immediately(before I have
finished actually sitting down). Thereafter, left clicking the cursor seems
to affect the desktop, rather than the game window. This would explain why
people would have programs opened when they go back to desktop, they have
clicked on a program shortcut apparently.
