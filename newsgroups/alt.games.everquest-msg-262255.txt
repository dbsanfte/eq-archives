I just hated to see you tear him up for valid reasoning, when his 
reasoning was just fine.

My objective was merely to clarify what the OPs argument was, and show 
my support for his reasoning. And that, assuming the asserted premises 
are valid then yes, its perfectly reasonable to suggest that: 'its 
broken and needs fixing, just not yet'.

To your comments that I actually demonstrate that those premises are in 
fact valid (ie that the enchanters are now less powerful than they -
should- be), I'll leave that to the OP to argue, as frankly, like you, 
I'm of the opinion that enchanters are still quite good.
