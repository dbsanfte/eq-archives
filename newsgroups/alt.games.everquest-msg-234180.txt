Wow I am so glad I left EQ when I did.
Why is every time someone detects a possible and even likely attempt
to screw the public it gets labeled as paranoid. Same ones said the
sharks on xev did not drop tons of plat, we know now they did, they
said there was no shared bank slot dupe bug, we know now there was.
Now who do you think is behind all this? Who has the most to gain? Yep
guess everyones just paranoid. Move along nothing to see here...sheesh
people leave this game, SoE doesnt deserve your loyalty. As alway
thats IMHO but very strongly.
