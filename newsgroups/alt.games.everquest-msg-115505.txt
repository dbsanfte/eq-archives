Hmmm can't speak for Afterlife, FoH's rep spreads across nearly all servers
(and isn't good) but I can vouch that Fu contains some of the most helpful
people I have met in game. Club Fu members completely changed my view of Top
Tier Guilds, one that was previously tarnished by the likes of RoV and CoL.
The hitch here is that if you were the sort of player these guilds were
after then you'd know who they were, they don't carry passengers.
