Sounds like you got a lot of mileage out of that system. However, no
offense, but it is pretty outdated at this point. Do you really expect
performance on par with today's machines just like you got back when
your's was current? 

Minimum requirements are just that, minimum. You can still play, but
your experience is not going to be nearly as pleasant as someone with
modern hardware. 

I *have* a new video card. I *love* the changes, though I do hope they
get a handle on the increased lag in some situations. I admit, that is a
problem.
