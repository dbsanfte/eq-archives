These are used in a quest and in about 30 or so trade skills

The quest is for one of the 6 crests for the tunarean court quest.  Here's a
link  you can do this at any level if you are carefull..
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=939
I would even sugest doing it before 10 just so you don't lose any experiance
when you die..  witch will hapen a lot if you try this quest below 35..
There realy isn't any use for this quest other thatn the faction adjustments
unles you are a tree huger, train driver, or ring master...  errr..  that
would be Druid, Ranger( I hate you Drander  3 CR because " i can pull just
one") and Beastlord.

And here is a link to all the trade skill items that use the misty acorns

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=14461

You can sell them in the bazaar for 2 - 20 or more plat depending on you
server or get your brewing skill to 128 the point this is triv.  and sell
the Oil for 10 - 50 + plat per ...  Again depends on your server

Ok if you are going to do the Trade skill side of this here is how you make
this, and also the quickest (Cheap) way to skill up.

Acorn Oil.
    1 Misty Acorn  (Foraged) or ground spawn
    1 Water Flask  Droped, Crafted (21), storebought

Water Flask  For the cheap people  =)
    1 Bottle   Storebought
    4 Pod of Water  Foraged


Now to raise your skill's fast
Fetid Essence
    1 Water flask  See above.
    1 fishing grubs  ( not just any will work.  Only 2 mercans sell the
corect one.  and as long as you aren't erodite you can get one of them from
Roary Fishpouncer for 2-3cp.  He is on Kerra Island _ the real one that you
get to through troxulia forest.  When you go throught the tunnel just con
the first kerran you see if you aren't KOS to him you can walk around there
all day..  Just don't kill any of them untill you are done with the
tradeskilling  ( this zone is awsome 20% XP mod)  Roary is in the hut to the
right..  Buy 7 backpack's full  that will get you to 122 verry fast.  )
close enought to the 128 triv that you will sucseed more than you dont with
the acorn oil.

Good luck.
