 For the casual, non-large guild player, there probably isn't much point
getting to 60 as fast as you can. For people that raid all the time and
want to be as efficient as possible, level 60 is the way to do it.
Sometimes we have guests with us in ToV. We had a level 55 monk
recently. He was in my group. It was interesting to see after every ae
how far his hp went down compared to mine. He basically died because the
cleric had to concentrate on the main tank instead of him.

 I 'rushed' and increased my run speed and regen because those are
beneficial. I haven't really done that much XPing in awhile since then.

 Depends on your play style and that of your guilds more than anything I
suppose. We regularly had PL days before Luclin came out for our people
that weren't 60 because we knew how beneficial 60 was.
