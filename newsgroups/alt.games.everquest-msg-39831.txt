Right, but you should know the patterns of when things get crowded.  Even
without numbers and for a new player, it won't take long before they realize
that 10PM ET is a living hell in some zones, but at 7AM ET its a barren
wasteland.

I don't agree with hiding the numbers, mind you, I think they're being too
paranoid.  But for normal day to day play, it just won't affect anything.

If they're so paranoid about competitors knowing numbers, why does Smed drop
the "410,000" figure every time he breathes?  Doesn't *that* number, opposed
to number of people logged in, give competitors *much* more useful
information?
