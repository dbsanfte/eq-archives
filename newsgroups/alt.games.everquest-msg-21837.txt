Been there, been a victim of that!

That's why I've found a few tanks who I rush to group with
because they understand that role of mana in the life of a
caster and make sure everyone is ready before pulling.

What I really hate are the tanks who are usually blue to me
who pull non-stop thinking they're "kicking major ass" and
they don't realize that I've been healing them continuously
each battle.  I guess they learn the hard way when I go oom
and can't heal them and they get pulverized by that "easy"
red mob...

Mike
