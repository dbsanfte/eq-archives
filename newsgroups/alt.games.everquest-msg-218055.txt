    Why Guk Is Avoided, by J. Grahame.

(1) The place is dark. It's honestly difficult to see mobs.
(2) The place is twisty, with lots of alcoves and hidden gullys. What looks
like a single pull frequently turns into three or more.
(3) The mob selection. More casters than other dungeons, and no
easy-to-charm stuff like the wolves in Rujark.
(4) The dungeon layouts. Typically, the target mob you need to
rescue/assassinate is a lot further away from the zone-in than in other
dungeons.
(5) Random loot drops. So far, I haven't seen anything really "sexy" drop in
Guk, like the plate BP, Veng. II ranged item, or Improved Damage IV item
from other themes. Guk also doesn't have the two big target vendor augments,
the 40 HP one or the 40 MANA one.
(6) Competition with Mistmoore. If you have a group that can tear through
undead, you have two choices of theme: MM or Guk. MM has a higher percentage
of undead, has wide-open rooms (unless you get the rocky crypt map), and is
much easier to see in. So why do Guk?

    On my server, Quellious, the numbers speak for themselves: 4000 people
with at least one Mistmoore win, 2000 people with at least one Rujark,
Takish, or Miragul win, 1000 people with at least one Guk win.

    No, they're results-oriented instead of process-oriented. They don't
regard playing a game as fun, they regard winning a game as fun. Losing is a
"waste of time", and to be avoided at all costs. As long as people think
that they can rack up huge rewards from the adventure merchants as long as
they accumulate points and don't fail, guess what they're going to do?
