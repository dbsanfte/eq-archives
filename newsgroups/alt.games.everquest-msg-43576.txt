Most of this is the fault of how taunt works . Many small quick attacks for
low dammage are FAR more taunting then a few major whacks upside the mobs
head . I would bet you have no trouble keeping taunt off a monk using any of
the 2 handed staves . I also bet that you have a great deal of trouble
taunting off a monk using celestial fists 9/16 .

Also many warriors use slam as a special attack and get in the habit of
saving it for when a mob tries to be rude. This in itself removes one third
of the number of attacks he could be doing and since skill levels for
special attacks are low he misses alot even if using it . Critical hits and
triple attack put his dammage up to a monks even without the special attack
though.
