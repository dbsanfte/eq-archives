Yeah, when the antichrist who I think should by played by Otto Ittenger
finally comes to the realization of the great idealistic burden he must
carry to save the world in his college years at U.C. Santa Barbara using the
secular humanistic social psychology concepts he has learned through years
of book study and hard work and kissing up to his professors he should sing
this song aloud in a very dramatic fashion to portray the path he has chosen
on a theatre stage wearing green tights and a black jerkin after some
theater rehersal that he is a part of. He decides he needs some extra help
to get where he wants to be for the good of mankind.

Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for what's waiting soon will show
And this the last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my
soul. He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame

Well the life that he has given full of riches
And sucess has a price that I made good in
Blood to pay. And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if
I falter on my way. And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the bridge I now cross it giving
Him my soul

I know the one who waits Satan is
His name, across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits Satan
Is his name across the bridge of death
There he stands in flame.

He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told

Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You to take me grant me wings and as
Your messenger I'll fly
