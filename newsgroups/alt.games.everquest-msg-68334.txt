    Top three CR people for physically pulling corpses out: Rogue, Monk,
Shadow Knight. ALL melees. I'll admit that this isn't true until the first
has Hide and Sneak, and the latter two Feign Death, but you can't argue with
it. CR has two elements: getting to the bodies, and *being able to deal with
aggro*. TWO casters have acceptable methods of dealing with aggro - Necros
can Feign, and Enchanters have fast-casting stuns, mezzes with fixed time
lengths, a Mem Blur spell to make the mob forget them, and a MR debuff to
make sure all of the above land. I've seen more warriors do a CR
successfully by using one Invis potion, then physically plowing out through
the mobs when Invis drops, than I've seen wizard or druid CRs total.
