Check out http://www.newsservers.net/

I signed up at a German university (no charge, no anything, they just want a
verifiable email and being a university they don't pass it on to 3rd parties
anyway), which I found through this site.

If you want some specific groups, go for 2 or 3 accounts. I have one for
.bin groups and this university one for normal postings.

ps. Later on I switched to an ADSL provider so I got a better access to
ng's, but I still use the other one at work and at friends' computers.
