I've only seen players with safe fall not get hit with 20k dmg while dropping. Cats 
and Monks seem to be best, haven't seen a rogue try it. Usually I go in first and 
clear the wanderers (61 necro) followed by our highest cleric with DA and then the 
rest of the group jump and either live or get rezzed. It's alwas amusing to watch
the splatter of your friends when they commit suicide.

One time we started at the beginning of the Hole and made it back to the waterfall. 
Ran short on time so I decided to take the raid force over the edge. Being the good 
lemmings they are many followed to their untimely death (missed! dangit!). Those that 
did survive were greeted by Nortlav the Scalekeeper and subsequently lifetapped for 
1k HP. Looked like a botched Nortlav kill so he didn't wander back to his little
corner and go on about Yael.

The CR was costly (about 12 coffins) but it was the most fun raid we'd had in a while.
Now we just follow the "Geronimo" theory for the quest mobs. With a single group the
exp loss from even a 90% rez is gained back rather quickly.

HINT: Make a brell worshiping assling rogue and park him at the back before 
attempting this. You can get derailed easily if Master Yael is up since his spawn
point is where I normally go to FD after harmshield wears off.
