Celaeno asked it already, but I am curious as well, is my gate (shaman)
somehow less effective than a Magician's gate?  I have used it successfully
in some damned awkward situations before.  Just made my second attempt at
the Erud's Crossing step of my epic, first time I gated out while the Killer
Shark was munching on me at level 26 or 27.  This time, I had sow and levi
up, so I swam to the surface, and ran out of range of the shark.  Just in
case you are curious, he did see through invis, had invis to animals up at
the time too.
