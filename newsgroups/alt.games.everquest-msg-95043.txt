I thought I'd be looking forward to this as well... but here's what I
think:

I'm so used to seeing the book open... plus, I KNOW i'm sitting,
because I see the open book.  Medding while just sitting, I often
forget I'm sitting when I try to cast a spell.  Then I have to hit the
stand hot key to get up and cast again.  With the open spell book, all
I had to do was hit the escape key.  Sure, escape key and a hot key
are both just one button push, but the hotkey is any one of 1 through
6 (8 with full view)... and have other buttons next to that hotkey on
the keyboard.  the Tilde, or the 9, 0 keys, etc.

"escape" was off, by itself, at the top corner of the keyboard, and
super-easy to hit and Alt-# to cast a spell.

Sure, it's really only a second or two that I'm saving... but when a
groupie is near death, that 1 second could save his life.

I just hate hitting a hotkey or alt-# to cast healing, then getting
the "You must be standing to cast a spell"... then hitting the #4
hotkey to stand, not realizing that it was actually my 5th hotkey that
was "stand"... :-)

PLUS... it's also quicker to change out spells... again, not too much
difference, but a second or two quicker.

I dunno... maybe it's just me.  :-)
