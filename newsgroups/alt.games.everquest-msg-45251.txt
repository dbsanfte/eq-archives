Heres my tradeskill cost/profit:
Baking:
Cost around 150pp and some time to get to 149 skill. Made 25pp on it on wedding
cakes so far. But use to make stat meat for warrior and low weight fish rolls
for monk.

Brewing:
Cost me around 250pp to get to 175 skill. Made 80pp so far, and used it a lot
for tailoring.

Fishing:
Next to nothing to get to 126 skill. No profit so far, just doing when selling
in NFP. Need later on for tailoring.

Fletching:
400pp to get to 133 skill, only doing cause i plan to do shawl quest someday. My
troll warrior used 150pp to get to 108 so he can make his own arrows. No profit.

Jewelcraft:
Spend 3500 to get to 132 skill, need it to 162, so probably gonna spend 3-4K
more. Again only for shawl, so no profit.

Pottery:
Spend around 400pp now, have 166 skill, only got expensive after done with the
normal poison vials, around 200pp up to there.
My rogue was the first to mass produce (or rather, didnt see anyone else sell
any the first month i sold. Might have been some before) Small Wisdom Deitys.
Bought Sands of Ro for 0-50pp each, 3pp in other cost, sold deity for 250pp
(price around 150pp on Veeshan now). Made around 10K and finances starting my
druid and her tradeskills. Probably too many selling them now to make it really
profitable, but you can still make 50-100pp once in a while on it. (oh, and for
people complaining about price, feel free to learn pottery, im happy to give you
recipes and tell you where to get materials. If you dont wanna get it to 130
skill yourself, you pay ;-) ).

Smithing:
Bottomless home, 'nuff said. Might be profitable if your cultural armor is
smithed, but as a wood elf, its only loss. Spend around 2500pp to get to 176
skill, stopped there.
Think i earned around 400pp total. All i use it for it to make banded for guild
and friends, and to make my bonings and studs for tailoring.

Tailoring:
Money maker, but BIGTIME time eater.
Spend around 3 weeks playing 12-16 hours a day (finally a good thing about being
unemployed) killing green mobs and getting no XP, AND used around 3K. That got
me to 100 skill. Spend around 600pp more to get to 115 skill, spend around 6-8K
more pp and XXXXXXXXX more time to get to 158 skill on Wu armor.
Now doing cultural tailoring, have 165 skill. Cost me 58pp and 2-5 rare forages
a try (sat in Kith last night while watching TV, sat there little over 3 hours
foraging, got 6 oak bark. Need 1 oak bark and 1-4 morning dew to make a try)

Earned enought to have 3 well equipped chars, finance the other tradeskills, and
still have money in bank. But was lucky, started making quivers the day they got
speed increase on top of the weight reduction, and got to Wu just as the Wu
recipes was discovered, so earned a lot on the initial "i want" rush from
buyers.
I can also sell the Cultural Wood elf boots, since they have +2 wis. All other
parts of the cultural are unsellable because you can get MUCH better stuff for a
cheap price (example the Tizmac Arms cost 25pp. 8 AC, 3 wis, - 3 int. My
cultural cost 58pp and 4 forages just to TRY to make one. Have 7 AC, 2 wis, 2
cha.

If you got to velious tailoring it get REALLY expensive, need velious pelts,
ground spawns or fished items, and for over 200pp worth of bonings A TRY. And
insane failure rates, havent made any velious stuff yet, did 5 tries at Black
Panther armor.

So tailoring have for me been THE profitable trade skill, but you can NOT buy
any of the stuff you need from vendors, so you have to hunt yourself, or buy
from other players. It WILL take time, and you WILL get bothered after camping
Heart Spiders in Guk 6 hours a day, 5 days in a row, and still only gotten 10
skill increases in Wu armor. Tailoring will NOT pay off before you get at least
87 skill where 10 slot backpacks are trivial, and normally best to get 20 points
over to reduce failure rate even more. So before 115 skill you will not earn
from tailoring, and you will have spend ridiculous amouth of time on it at that
time. Do NOT use as a fast way to money, only do it if you plan to a) learn all
tradeskills to make shawl quest, or b) LOVE the challenge to doing something
REALLY hard.


Almost all stuff for all tradeskills can be bougth, with tailoring being the
only skill where you have to hunt everything. So you can get all other
tradeskills up fast, ONLY a question of money (still get mad when chanters with
100 skill in jewelcraft complain about it being a hard skill. I got to 132 skill
in 2 hours in Felwithe). Tailoring is a question of spending a LOT more time
doing tradeskills or selling, than actually killing stuff.

My druid is level 36, and had a play time of 48 days, 14 hours, 24 min when i
checked last night. Thats the real cost of tradeskills, TIME. If i had only
killed stuff and levelled i would be 50+ by now, and maybe even have my epic.
Would probably have had more money from loot than i make from tailoring. But i
like tradeskills, and my high skill levels make me a sought after person on the
server, especially for my tailoring skill. But im still not sure it was worth
spending all that time on.
So only my druid do tradeskills, all others only do what they need (warrior need
fleching, monk could use baking to make fish rolls). And none of the others will
learn languages (druid am master in 10 languages, and expert in 1 more. Not
including Common).

So only do tradeskill if you really want to get the full of the game, or enjoy
the challenge, the money are better if you spend time on levelling up and
killing mobs instead.
