True, but they have to catch you first, then there's a messy court
hassle if you decide to contest it, and not a sure shot that they can
prove that they gave you the service in the first place. Usually too
much hassle for them to bother with once you're out of sight. Store I
worked at never bothered with pursuing shoplifters once they were out
the door if they weren't caught before then. ( Repeat offenders
usually wouldn't get out the door after a couple times, though. >< )

Like I said, all but a few around here allow pump first then pay.

>Utilities all want a deposit.

True, but there's a good chance that deposit won't cover the bill you
came up short on when they cut you off...
