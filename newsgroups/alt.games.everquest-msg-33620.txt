Why not just get invis and EB?  Not like there's a shortage of
druids in CS.  And you clearly are willing to use the help of
high level friends, since you had a buddy kill Whisper for you
to get you into SS in the first place, which by the way was
unnecessary, unless you plan on going from SS to CS a lot
on your own, you could have simply grouped with anyone
else with the key and gone thru with her.

Brells Beard, if you plan to go thru there a lot, get your CS fang
and get ports!
