Uh, no, you were insufficiently astute. 

TH understood entirely what you wrote. Your argument runs as
follows:

Phillip means "Horselover"
Phillip is an acceptable name
Horselover is similar to Ilikepotatos
---------------
ILikepotatos should be an acceptable name

Wheras for your argument to be sound it would require the argument
to look something like:

Phillip means "Horselover"
Phillip is an acceptable name
Patricia means "Ilike potatoes"
Patricia has a similar relationship to "Ilikepotatos" as...
   ...Philip has to "Horselover"
---------------
Patricia should be an acceptable name

The relationship between the "means" Phillip and the "is" Ilikespotatos
is not as precise as the first argument would appear to require.

It can be refuted by pointing out that while horselover IS similar to
Ilikespotatos Horselover would *also* be an impermissable name.
