Watch out as an Iksar though - most of the folk there are vendors, so
won't aggro, but you may be eaten by the enchanter gypsy and her pet.
I've had good results binding Iksar on the opposite side of the camp to
her, on the other side of the tent-thingies.

To get to SK, you may need to swim underneath the stone bridge, to avoid
the bridge guard, and the pally type there, who are on Qeynos factions I
believe.
