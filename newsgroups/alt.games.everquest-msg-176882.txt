Druid/Necro (my standard answer to this question) is an awesome combo.

Druid/Shadowknight has some of the strengths of the Druid/Necro pair,
along with good tanking ability.  Nice.

Shaman/Melee, as somebody else pointed out, is a can't lose pairing
tool.

Cleric/Tank works too.

Bard/Caster seems a good pairing too.

Really, you can do any healing class (Druid, Shaman, Cleric, and even
Paladin in a pinch) and any melee class and make it work.  Int casters
don't make all that great a partner for melee's due to lack of
healing, although if your melee is a pally it could work.  Ranger
healing is a joke, and while SK healing is nice, it's not good enough.

I can't think of any combination of casters that wouldn't work with
the right players at the controls.
