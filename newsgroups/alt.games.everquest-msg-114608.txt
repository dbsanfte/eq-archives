Halfling is hands down, no arguements possible, the best ranger of all
according to raw stats and the 5 percent xp bonus.

eq.castersrealm.com

Look under ranger creation guide and compare. Even putting all points
in stamina it still has FANTASTIC ranger stats.
The only way it lacks is that it can't wear the Treeweave bp, but that
is kind of passe' now anyway.

Its really quite surprising that the halfling has the best ranger
stats of all, it being the new ranger on the block.
