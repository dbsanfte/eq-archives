That's what FedEx basically told me when I told them I'd never ship with 
them again. That since I won't use them ever again their delivery 
problem to my address is not a problem.

(Step by step OT 'wtf did they do?' for those curious:
They lost my delivery.
They denied the claim on the delivery, as they claim it was delivered.
The package showed up at my local post office 3 and a half weeks later
They picked it up (USPS cannot do anything but call FedEx on this... I 
knew it was there but couldn't claim it). Driver said it had to return 
to Depot and be delivered tomorrow. I was there when driver picked it up.
They returned it to the sender instead of delivering to me.
The sender reshipped it Next day air AM (package is a month late at this 
point, and was an RMA for a wrong part already)
They claim now to have delivered it to my home... I took most of a day 
off and sat on my front porch from 8 am till 2 pm. No truck. Tracking 
says it was delivered, no signature required due to paperwork on file 
(There is no such paperwork, and after they lost it once I requested 
they purge any reords from my address. They can't find it EXCEPT when 
they want to leave it at someone else's house) at 11:47 am on that day.
It's back in claims. I've told them I've got the 6 hour VHS tape of me 
sitting on my porch waiting for them, playing tetris on my laptop, with 
cnn/fox news/msnbc/cspan on in the background.
I am NEVER EVER shipping Fed Ex again. If a merchant can't ship me UPS 
or <shudder> USPS, I won't buy from them.)
