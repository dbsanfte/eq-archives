It's got to be willowisps,  by far probably the most ganked mob in the
game.  Though there are certain mobs on my Deathlist

Kizdean Gix--Now has his own drawer at the Norrathian Morgue thanks to
my druid.

Martar Icebear--Slaughtered with extreme prejudice on sight

D'vinn--backstabbed and dotted done in by both my rogue and druid

Dragoon Zytl--tied score recently, with equal deaths to both sides,
Since still blue to my druid, i will probably kill him a few more times.

Thistle Underbrush-- Any one need Braided ivy cords?

Tundra Jack and Iceberg--The Kill Stealing MF'ing duo is on my list for
when i get a few more levels under my belt.  42 now, give me a few more
levels and They will go down.

Vengence is profitable in norrath as well heheh.
