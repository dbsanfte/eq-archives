Could anyone see any problems with my PC setup why it would make EQ soo
choppy no matter what Zone I'm in (some are better then other, but Barely).
I even have all the models turned OFF (Which really sucks) and video quality
down too LOW.
I have a P3 Celeron 933, 512 Mb of PC 133 Ram, ATI Radeon 8500, Sound
Blaster Live platinum, running WinXP and also ran win98,  and am on a DSL
connection.  If it helps any I have all the expansions.

 (I know I need a whole new system LOL)

Any ideas would be a big help, thanks in advance
