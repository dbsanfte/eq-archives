There are lots of classes that are good at both Soloing and grouping.
Magicians, Druids, Warriors, Necromancers are the best solo classes.
Paladins, Shadow knights, Rangers, Monks, Beast Lords, and Wizards are
decent soloers but are better in groups.  Enchanters and Clerics are very
group oriented, Soloing with them is possible but difficult.  They are very
sought in groups.

Its better to start out well, but any stats you neglect can be made up with
Gear. For example, Wizards, Necromancers, Magicians, and Enchanters are all
dependent on the Intelligence Stat.  it you neglect intelligence, there are
hundreds, if not thousands, of items that add to intelligence.

Stat mistakes usually don't hurt too much anyway.

> Is there portal magic or do you have to run everywhere ?

Portal magic exists, and is wonderful.  Only druids and wizards can teleport
themselves.  Everyone else must has two options. One: Run everywhere. Two:
Pay a high level Wizard or Druid Teleport you there.  At level 19 and 20
respectively, Drudis and Wizards get self-teleport spells.  At level 29,
both get group teleports, where they can port up to five others with them.
Later on, Wizards get Translocation spells, where they can port others while
not porting themselves.

Lots. My favorite is http://eq.castersrealm.com
Its a great site with lots of info.

Maps can be gotten at www.eqatlas.com
Levels 1-6 are extremely easy. 6-10 are also bery easy, just not as easy as
1-6.
