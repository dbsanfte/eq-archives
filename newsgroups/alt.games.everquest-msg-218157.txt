I've seen lots of families that had a single child of several turn out 
very difficult. Bad parenting? Hardly; model citizens, with a number of 
well adjusted kids to show for it... Bad genes? Maybe... but I maintain 
that that would not be anybodys 'fault'.

But it could be other stuff too...bad peer group, for example... oh but 
the parents should have identified and intervened... without alienting 
their kids in the process... parents aren't gods, at best they can 
influence their kids, but the kids have a mind of their own, and they 
react autonomously and unpredictably to any given parenting style.

Take another look. My example is exactly what you said. You said the 
ONLY parties responsible for the kids actions are the parties 
responsible for deciding to create them. Therefore, in order to hold SoE 
responsible for what it makes kids do (presuming that it does in fact 
make kids do stuff) then SoE must have a say in whether they are 
created. Obviously that is a crock.
