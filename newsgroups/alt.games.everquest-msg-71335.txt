Then yes, a full suit of silk and about 5pp would be the best twinkage
you can do. It's amazing the difference of having enough money for all
of your level one spells can be! And it's safer to have a guildmate
transfer the stuff over too.

Enjoy the young necro. Eventually, you'll have enough to twink back to
your necro if you so desire, or be able to give stuff to your other new
characters.
