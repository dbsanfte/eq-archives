Leaving in the sig as relevant since he's on my server.  :)

My guild just decided we're in this category last night.  Applications
closed this morning.  We'd like to progress in elementals and move toward
Time, and it's tough to do that when you're killing Grummus (and watching
all the loot rot) for the 17th time.  We also hit 70 people in raid last
night, the only 2-box being my pocket cleric (cause *I* know when I'm safe
to heal).  We never want to need a "secondary" raid.  Ever.  And we're
getting just a bit too close to that already.

The plus side to this is that when *all* elemental guilds have made this
decision, it leaves a void to be filled.  If past events are any indicator,
someone will try to fill that void.  In fact, probably a half dozen
someones, with two failing within the first week, two more failing within a
month...  building a guild is tough.
