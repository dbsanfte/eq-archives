1 point into dual wield is all it'll require.  Worst case, you hit 13,
you put in 1 point, you get DW 13.  Add 7 more points, you've got DW
20.  That just needs your skill points from 13 and 12.

You're at 8, now, so go ahead and dump points into Smithing.  You said
you wanted cheapest possible.  Well, skill points (up to the paying
point) are the cheapest possible.  And the next few points only cost a
single copper up to a couple of silver (depending on where you stop).
Just keep on buying points until you hit, say, 1 GP.  You'll probably
hit 20 points before then.  Sharpening rusty weapons would cost you
more.
