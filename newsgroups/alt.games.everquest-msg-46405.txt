Thanks for the advice. Surprisingly, however, I was able to resolve
the problem myself.

I decided that if it was gonna take all that time at the Character
Selection screen, I would try to fix the zone boot problem (the issue
where I am returned to the server selection screen almost every time I
zone). Research on usenet and Everquest.com indicated that
DATARATE.TXT determined packet size for communication. I've played
with this before, but never had any luck. My setup has a Linux system
with a modem that dials the internet and shares the connection with
the rest of the network (usually, my system is the only one accessing
the internet). It dawned on me that my windows computer wasn't really
talking to everquest, it was the Linux box. So, I reduced the MTU and
MRU sizes to 296 in pppd and voila! I still zone boot, but I've
virtually eliminated the delay at the Character Selection screen.

My guess is that Everquest looks at the packet size of a given
connection and decides how much data it really needs to send back and
forth during Character Selection. The recent patch must have changed a
threshold or something. Now that it knows that I've got a slower
connection, it decided it really didn'nt need all that communication
and let me in.

In any event, zone booting is a dream compared to the hell of a 2.5 -
3 minute zone.
