On and off over the past few days, my Berserker has been leader in his 
groups.  Leadership points accumulated gradually, and I peeked briefly 
at the table after asking in age chat how to do so (its the L button 
without anything else, I'd tried alt L and ctrl L but not just plain L) 
but otherwise ignored it.

Yesterday, I got a new message; I'd filled up my leadership bar and 
couldnt' get any more points till I spent some.

Now the bar I had looked like a regular exp bar with the yellow bar 
segments and a blue line running thru it, but underneath it said things 
like 1 of 4.  There being no abilities available for one point, when I 
originally looked and didn't even have one point yet, I didn't think 
about it.

Well, at 4 points I could pick all but two of the abilities; one costs 6 
points and a second costs 7 points.

Looking thru the list, I picked Delegate Group Main Assist, for four 
points, so my bar could start filling up again.  Now I can save up to 6 
points, which still puts that 7 point ability out of reach.

Several of the abilities have more than one level available to them, but 
the one I picked has only one.

Frankly, I loved the ability, with it on, the target of whoever I 
designated shows up to everyone in the group as having a special 
different looking target ring under it.  Playing with an enchanter in my 
group, this meant that she could very easily see what the current target 
is, and so much more easily mez everything else.  I could see what was 
going on, so I could stun adds if needed to help her get things under 
control, and switch back to the real target without having to go thru 
targeting MA and assisting; to be honest, after playing a cleric to 65, 
a bard to 57, a shaman to 52, and an enchanter to 30, I have a strong 
tendancy not to use assist since I'm so used to being responsible in 
part for crowd control and debuffing future targets.

I did have to use assist on some mobs where they stood really close 
together, and I couldn't tell which one the target circle was on.

Later experimenting determined that you have to have 3 people in the 
group to use the ability.

So, questions:

1) do you have to have GOD to see the circles?

2) it seemed that I have to be leader of the group to use the ability, 
is this correct?

3) what about other abilities like mana regen... only works if the 
leader has the ability?

4) many of the leadership ability descriptions are quite vague; in 
particular how much hp regen, mana regen, attack, etc is given by eash 
level of the various abilities?

5) do the abilities work across zone lines, or is there a range limit on 
them in a zone?

6) what are opinions of the various leadership abilities?

It looks to me as though the system is best designed to work with a 
regular group who can designate a member to be the regular leader and so 
get all the LA's maxed out, rather than spread the points around the 
group; and further to annoy people trying to form groups by rewarding 
the person who happens to be leader more than the rest of the group, 
even though leader is really just the power to invite, kick, and place 
an LFP message... or at least it was until now.

Grage, 30 Berzerk, joy of mezzers everywhere, Luclin
