Interrupting casters (especially gating ones) is a big benefit.  Not many
classes can do it "on demand" like a paladin, the few other classes that
have Stun spells usually have better spells memorized anyway ;)

Sure, you won't outdamage a rogue anytime soon, but they need someone to
evade onto ;)

Paladins can be very good at protecting casters.  We're probably the only
melee class that can build up significant taunt-value WITHOUT doing
damage - prefect for not screwing over the enchanter trying to mez the
problem mobs.  Turn off auto-attack, use Taunt, Stuns (the no-damage ones),
Root, maybe Flash-of-Light when appropriate.

Root-parking can be a great form of ghetto-crowed control in some
situations.  You've got the highest AC and HP of any Root-casting class, so
you can take a beating while dragging off the extra mob to Root away from
the battle... and like you said, your damage won't be missed too much ;)

Make sure you're getting all the mileage you can from your spells,
otherwise you're just a warrior with crappy skill-caps and worse armor, who
forgot to duel-wield.
