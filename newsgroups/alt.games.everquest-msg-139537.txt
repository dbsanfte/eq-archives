I know.  That makes it *so* much easier.  Well, for the only real class 
in EQ, anyway ;)

Really sucky, REALLY boring quest.  Plus I managed to stumble into the 
bar above the dock and run into some gnome who didn't like me.  Thank 
goodness *he* was blue.  Ran into a blue one *and* a white one later, 
and had caution enough to con first that time.  Weird thing is, that 
gnome was apparently supposed to be in HHK only he tends to appear in 
that bar every so often.  So I ran out and zoned into NRo, zoned back 
in, ran back carefully, peeked in - and all the chars that *had* been in 
that bar had despawned and new ones had taken their place.

How much do those picks cost from merchants?  The orc hatchets used for 
a GFay quest are sold for something like 6 copper then they turn around 
and charge somewhere around 7pp per hatchet when you want to buy em.  I 
figured the picks would be the same, and farming em would be a royal 
pita.

Actually, not talking about the gypsies anymore.  Talking about the 
everyday sellers in Freeport.  I'm tired of having to climb over the 
counter everytime I have to buy more kiola sap in North Freeport :)  I 
just cannot get that faction to move though.  Is there *one* faction 
only that will raise them?  Because some of those merchants don't seem 
to be on any faction at all (ie, those guys in the building you run 
through when coming off the boat in EFree) and some of them are on four 
or five (ie, the chicks in the pub in NFree with the brewer cask in it, 
that bitch in the bank who won't deal with me until I squeeeeeze in 
behind her...)
