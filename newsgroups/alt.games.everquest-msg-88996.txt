Twice in Mistmoore I crashed to the desktop yesterday.  I can't recall the 
last time this happened, previous.

After the second one, I thought about what I did when it happened, and in 
both cases, I was unmemming the spell I had temporarily memmed in slot 3 to 
remem tash*.

/book 1
right-click spell in slot 3.
( it doesn't unmem in the .00472 seconds I impatiently gave it )
double-right-click the spell icon in my impatience.
crash to desktop.

If I remember, I am going to test this again tonight to see if I can 
duplicate this.  If any of you have the wild urge, give the double-right-
click a shot on a memmed spell ( while looking at your book ) to see if it 
takes you to the desktop.

aside:

Here's a quick hint for those of you who are Mistmoore Newbies like me:  If 
you are in the castle and the lady who drops the drums is trying to charm 
the Ranger ( again ), you -can- AOE stun her to interrupt her spells. But, 
don't stand next to a wall that has 4-5 other mobs on the other side of it.  
They will hate you, and so will all of their friends they bring.

I hate it when I do stupid shit.  I hate it even more when I do the 
same stupid shit that has gotten me killed several times, now.  But, on the 
other hand, I'm learning a lot about Mistmoore.  That place is fun fun fun.
