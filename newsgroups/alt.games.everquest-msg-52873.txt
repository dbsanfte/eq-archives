... and in a single tank situation I would do the exact opposite. In a
single melee situation your group is probably underpowered to begin
with. You're going to be casting more mez and slow spells, so you're going
to have to be as mana efficient as possible. Aug lasts longer, costs
less. It's fairly cut-n-dry (IMO) as to which one to be using.
