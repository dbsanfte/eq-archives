 Okay I'm totally lost on what point you are TRYING to make here. Are you
saying because I don't know the authors of the software I'm guilty of my own
statement? If I heard that there was a security problem with a microsoft
product, (perhaps I should say another security problem) I would definately
research the issue, as I have done here, by asking questions...
 I merely read a post on another board concerning this issue and I asked if
anybody here had heard about it. Geez people, read the statements before you
act like a moron and respond acidically.
