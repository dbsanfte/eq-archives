It sounds as though you're playing your first character. This means
you will be poor - no way around it.

The people you mention are probably on their second or third
characters, and have 'twinked' money and items from their higher level
characters.

It's nothing to worry about - keep plugging away and you'll be high
level too, eventually.

Trade skills are a mixed bag. About the only way to make money at any
of them when your skill is low, is to be on a brand new server. And
even then, don't expect to make a lot of money.

As far as which skill to try your hand at, I can only speak about one
of them with any authority - tailoring (see my tailoring guide at the
website noted below).

Tailoring is *easy* to learn and advance in at the low skill levels.
The bulk of your supplies are gotten by killing lowbie animals and
spiders and such, and are quite plentiful. However, at the higher
skill levels, it's just the opposite - tailoring gets extremely
difficult to do when the items you need to continue are rare, or drop
off only high-level mobs.

Frankly, if your goal is to make money, I'd advise you to stay well
clear of the trade skills in general. More often than not, they're a
major money sink. But if you're looking to add a bit of color to your
character and have something to do beside eternal hack-and-slash, then
certainly try several of the trade skills out!

>im a 14 lvl wood elf ranger and still trying to learn stuff.

Get yourself a magic weapon (anything will do) and kill wisps. Lots
and lots of wisps. You can turn the Greater Lightstones in to a gypsy
in North Karana for something like 12 plat each. That's a good money
maker for your level.
