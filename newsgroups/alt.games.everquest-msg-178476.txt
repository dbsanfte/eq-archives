I think you misunderstand.

Before the economic meltdown, consumers would, on average, upgrade
their computers every 3 years.  That's what I've heard, anyway; I'm
not sure how accurate that is.

It goes without saying that hardware keeps getting better faster
stronger all the time.

I think there are a lot of people who wouldn't look twice at
$12.95/month for an online game, but balk at the idea of spending
$800 for a new computer.  It's probably a psychological issue more
than anything else.  But in any case, affordability is only one
factor.

I think there are a lot of people (like myself) who could afford to
upgrade their computer, but can't justify the expense in order to
improve their gaming experience.  At one point, I realized I was
lusting after a new computer...so that EverQuest would play better.
(All my other applications run more than fast enough on my current
PC.)  I just can't get myself to write a $1000-$2000 check so that
EverQuest runs better.

Of course, I *will* write that check, eventually.  At which point,
I will probably give EQ2 a look.
