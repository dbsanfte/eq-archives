You hang out with the crappy druids then.  Most of the druids I have 
grouped with, if they are the main healer, spend most of their time 
healing.  If they have excess mana, then they toss in nukes and such as 
well.

Shaman don't have to med up, shaman regen mana quite quickly and 
efficiently, at least at higher levels.  Even in the 40s with can II and 
Stoicism, mana regen is quite decent.

I have done many XP groups with no cleric.  I have done the Courtyard in 
BoT when I was the slower/haster/healer with some backup healing from the 
Paladin who was tanking, and four DPS types.  I have done a variety of XP 
camps, and LDoN adventures with a druid as the main healer, where I have 
not had to cast a single heal, other than when canning/torporing myself.

A well equipped ranger makes a passable tank, for that matter, a well 
equipped rogue does too.  I've done several PoV camps with a rogue 
tanking, and a druid healing.

It's people like you that perpetuate the myth that you need to have a 
cleric as the healer.
