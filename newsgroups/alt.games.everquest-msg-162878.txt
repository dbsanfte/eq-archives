Thanks for the suggestion, my wife and I created new characters tonight  on
Firiona Vie. She is Summerbreeze (Barb Warrior) and I am Winterfury (Barb
Shaman). We're going to start our long journey by hunting for a while
outside of Halas. I've already started enjoying the company of those I've
met here, seems like a good crowd. But man, I am slow at this level ...
