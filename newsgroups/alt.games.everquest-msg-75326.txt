While you're at it, allow the Nexus Scions to TP you to the Hole.

Of course, this would only as a last shot before death.  That way the people
who accidently attacked (as I do to my guild trainers on a monthly basis)
can just sit there and take their punishment and avoid the penalty.  Either

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
