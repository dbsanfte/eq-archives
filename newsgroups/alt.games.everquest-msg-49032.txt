	So by my going to the effort to get a license, the state isn't
giving me the right to drive but a priveledge.  Thanks.  

	Now back to DUTY vs. RIGHT, the focus of my post.  We all
have, upon reaching legal age, the right to apply for a license, not a
duty.  Oops. Priveledge again.  Nothing in the Constitution about
driving.

	Now back to DUTY vs. RIGHT. If I reach legal age, I have the
right to buy a drink to celebrate, not a duty do buy a drink.  Ooops
Priveledge again, at least now that Prohibition has been repealed.
Since the Constitution never allowed Americans the right to drink,
Prohibition removed the privelsedge.  The repeal of Prohibition
returned to us the priveledge.   
	
 	Now back to DUTY vs. RIGHT.  If arrested for DWI, we have the
right to an attorney and the right to have him present during
questioning.  We don't have a duty to call one.  Hey, I think I
finally got one.
