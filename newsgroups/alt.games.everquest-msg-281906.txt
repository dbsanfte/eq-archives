Some level 70 toon was complaining in /ooc that Permafrost was broken.
He wanted to try and solo Lady Vox since it seemed easy for a group of
mid 50's to deal with and should be "piece of cake" for a single 70
toon to kill.

But everytime he got close, the dragon just threw him to the EF zone
in.

Last time I fought Vox, I was a mid 50's beastlord and I haven't been
able to get close at 64 when I was doing my epic in PF.  And yes there
were lots of snickering in my guild over that moron.  I always get a
kick whenever some high level toon suddenly appeared and tries to be
"smart" while getting lots of things wrong.  

My favorite so far was a 55 chanty who claimed to have been a EQ
player since Kunark and was invited to PoV group.  He ended up in HoH
somehow and couldn't figure out where on the map "west wall" was.
