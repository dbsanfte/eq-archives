So - how much content exists now?    I've never felt as
constrained as I did in EQ for level-appropriate content
with decent XP/loot.

Yeah, been there, done that -- and EQ2 isn't "short of content"
by that standard, at least to 40ish.   It is short at the high-end
of the game -- but the vast majority of players aren't at the
high-end yet.

> "Strawman" is a good description of your reply, though.  =P

I'm just pointing out that EQ2 has enough content to allow a
player to XP up to 40 (at least) without doing the same thing
twice.   How's that 'short of content?'   It's certainly (from
my perspective anyway) *more* open than EQ was after
Velious -- for players not at the level-limit.

I've seen "short of content"  (five groups at the giant fort in
Frontier Mountains, for instance) -- EQ2 is NOT short of
content.
