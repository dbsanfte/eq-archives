Odd I find there are more tactics and strategies employed when you've 
got a few adds. The "single pull" requires no tactics or strategies once 
its arrived.

I mean for a 6 man group... one guy has to figure out how to pull, and 
the rest just mash a few keys when it arrives.

Encounters that are designed to be you fight a group of mobs is a real 
plus. In EQ1 by and large they only had the option of balancing single 
mobs against entire groups because that was the reality of 99% of pulls. 
With EQ2 they can experiment with weaker mobs that come in clusters as 
an alternative form of challenge. I think that's great.

(There are some issues I have with EQ2, but in principle I *like* 
encountering a cluster of mobs.

In P&P you frequently engaged the entire gaurd house at once, after 
dealing with patrols. In EQ1, you'd literally find a room with 5 mobs 
playing cards, and you'd lure them out and murder them one by one in the 
hallway while the rest of the crew obliviously dealt the next hand. Its 
like a B horror movie... hey fellow kobolds... I heard a noise in the 
dark hall, I'll go check on it by myself. 5 minutes later... hey Stu 
never came back... what's that sound? I'll go check on it, you all stay 
here...

Sure sometimes luring one out and killing it makes sense... but 99% of 
the time? The only time in EQ1 when you engage multiple mobs in an xp 
group is when you literally so overpower them it just doesn't matter.
