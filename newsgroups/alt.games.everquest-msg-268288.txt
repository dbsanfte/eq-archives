In those two levels, killing things in the high 40s became green.  More
importantly, the GAME changed awhile ago, so even at 60, they weren't worth
killing.  It used to be that xp was maximized by killing as many of the lowest
blues you could find.  Sebilis was packed.  The game evolved, and Sony made it
worthless to kill mobs outside of 5 levels of your own.  THAT made DC
worthless.

I don't know anyone who recommends getting this AA in the last 2 years.

Oh, I'm agreeing.  It's not a great AA.  It was back in Luclin, but just isn't
today.
