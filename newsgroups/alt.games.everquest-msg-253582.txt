My favorite places to farm solo are PoTactics and Riwwi.  In tactics
you can farm the piglet, which is incredibly boring but pretty easy
once you get the hang of it.  You can also watch for the Enraged War
Boar.  He is also pure melee, snareable, doesn't cast, etc...  He
drops ornate wrist patterns for leather, chain and silk.  I sold my
last two for 70k each.

Riwwi also takes some learning.  I suggest you just try out the arena
and try to learn it yourself.  Named pop in the arena and around the
rest of the zone, with pretty nice drops, ranging in value from 5k to
100k or more, and almost all of them are soloable by a Ranger, Druid,
Necro...not too sure a chanter can keep a charm there long enough to
help though.  There is a lot to learn about the zone though so be
ready for lots of deaths.
