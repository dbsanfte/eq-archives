If you stay away from the port enclosure you'll be fine. You can hunt there at
level 20 if you like, provided you hunt in the NE corner of the zone. 
The easiest way to get to the Overthere is via boat from ogre island in Timorous
Deep. Just go around the rocky outcrop to the west of the ogre village until you
can make out the dock. Wait for the boat to arrive and leave. Then as it passes
you swim out to it and get on board. The boat stops before it gets to the port
giving you more than enough time to swim to shore. This way's a hell of a lot
safer than running through Firiona Vie. ;)
