Hmmm - his Magelo is woefully out of date, but he has
FT9, MC3, Waterform 1 (for use in dungeons).  Mana pres for detrimental
spells, IDIV and 76 AA's (of which 19 are banked - I could max 
SCS and a couple of other things just by logging in and spending them -
I'm saving for pet affinity, however for when I raid again.)

He raid buffs to 4300+ HP and about 4200-4300 mana with VOQ
on.  He could really use IE (3 - he's at 280+ int w/o KEI)
With just SV, Kragg, IoS, 9 and Mark on he's right at 4k.

Our usual XP group in the Plant is a warrior (switched to a 2hand
weap for less ripostes), mage, bl, cleric, druid, wizard.  The Wiz is
FT9 as well (around 50ish AA now) and the cleric and druid are 200+
aa, max FT.  I can nuke as hard as cast/recast and aggro allow and still
not be the one calling for med breaks.

This *has* to be a matter of a better tank and mobs that live longer than
ours do.  If I nuked hard enough to need a mana robe I'd get summoned all
the time.  If mobs lived long enough for me to nuke out my mana, then
they wouldn't be sewer mobs (my current favorite XP spot).  When we're in
the groove, the druid, mage and wiz all nuke, the 2 pets and the BL are
on the back, the BL drops 2 nukes per (his 2 biggest, fights don't last 
long enough for them to recycle).

With SD, 9, KEI (over VoQ for duration), FT9, MC3, Waterform 1, base
standing of 3, self rods (5) and 20 medding he's getting 72 mana per tick
in our groups.  I've considered WF3, since our groups spend so much time
in dungeons.

I hardly go OOM at all :-P  remember, my mage grew up *poor* and I've 
lived with beyond substandard gear for much of my life.  Some of his gear
still is.  Of course, I consider several parts of my BL's gear to be
substandard - but that's because I expect more than just DPS out of him.

Elemental Silence and CoTAM are designed to go together, and in
Tak (hard, not worth the hassle in normal, mobs just go poof to quick - we
deliberately pull 2-3 at a time to save time.) and BoT are an insanely
powerful tool.  The 2 situational uses I alluded to.

I bought CoTAM for 22500 and ES for 3 or 4k.

As I said - 2 are useless:

Child of Ro is a steaming pile of buffalo feces.  About all it's good
for is duels.

Destroy Summoned - Evoc, situational, comparable base ratio to 
Black Steel.  The only advantage it offers is a small resist adjustment.

2 are "eh" ok:

Jewelry bag is useless until I grab a pair of Ornate boots.  I have the
cash, I've just spent it on the BL instead.  Again, my perception that 
he needs the money more to fufill his roles.  (remember, you can't 
summon a jewelry bag if you have a summoned focus item on you)

Maelstrom of Ro is okay - However,  In my groups the rest of us get hit 
so seldom that the increased mana cost over just DS'ing the MT is not
even close to cost effective.  With EQWatcher timing my DS's, it's a
simple thing to keep the DS on the MT at all times.

A couple more see only occasional use:

Maelstrom of Thunder has it's uses - Boss mob fights where mana efficiency
isn't an issue and highest DPS w/o aggro is.  However, the innate resist 
rate on rains combined with the fact that they don't focus combined with
the fact that they are Evoc results in their not finding much time in the
rotation now that I'm not raiding.

Remember that Malosinia offers a 15% increase in debuffing, at a 50%
increase in cost, so I usually use 'sini over it.  Where I don't use
'sini I use Mala.

In the Every Day category:

Black Steel is my bread and butter nuke, I live it and breathe
it.  Despite the fact that it only sells for 5k now and I've sold
many a copy - I don't regret for an instant buying it for 13k
way back when.

Girdle of Magi'Kot, Blade of the Kedge - 'nuff said.

Planar Renewal - a part of all my combat spell sets.

Shield of Maelin - usually if I need extra MR, otherwise I use
Kragg.  This doesn't dimishish it's usefulness overall, most people
don't have a BL at all times.

Just for giggles compare to the 5 BL specs: SD (use all the time)
Sorsha (my only pet), Rellic (my main pet proc, stun with no knock
back), Arag's Celerity (the only haste to use) and Frost Shard
(my top DPS nuke unless I get the GoD one).  There isn't a single
one I don't use constantly, every day.  This is why they command
higher prices on Lanys - BL's simply don't want to be without any of
these.  Mages can easily be w/o a huge number of their Specs and
no one will even notice.  After 3 weeks at 3k, I had to drop my last
jewelry bag to 2.5k to sell it.  After 5 weeks at 3k I still haven't
sold either of my copies of Maelstrom of Ro.  Maelin and CoR sit there
at 3k and less for weeks.  My one dupe BL spell, SD, sold for 7500 over
night.

I'm curious what group you'd use a rooting pet in.  It's a worse tank
(it takes damage age a higher rate than its increased HP compensates
for), it does no more damage, and it doesn't stun.  At any rate, I've
never won a single rune for turnin.  All my rune spells are purchased,
and people try to get 40 to 65k out of RS.
