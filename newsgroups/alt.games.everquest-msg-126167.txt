I just spent a couple of hours playing with the new interface on test.  There were
several GM's in WFP telling people how do do various things.  Lot's of /ooc chatter
going on about it.  This is what I noticed, playing a level 5 wood-elf warrior, with
Lenny playing a level 5 cleric.  This is _not_ comprehensive. 

The Good:
1) Overall looks nice.  Lot's of /oocing OMG this is great!  Overall, people seemed
happy with it, and not too many seemed to outright hate it.
2) You can have as many bags (well, at least four, which is how many I had on me)
open at one time.  No bank bags to see if this is true there also, but I suspect it
is.
3) You can type in a coin amount now when trading and banking.
4) You can turn off character rotation at the character select screen if you want.
5) The mouse wheel works in all screens that have a scroll bar.
6) The windows fade when you don't have your mouse on them.  Nice for little used
screens like buffs, were you don't _always_ need to be checking it.
7) You can now see all the skill level points you have, not just the ones that are
over 100.
8) When you move your mouse over a health, stamina, or mana bar, it tells you what
percentage of the bar remains.  This works for group members health as well.
9) More spell icons.  Easier to tell them apart (only seen with low level cleric
spells, however.  Dunno about other classes/levels).
10) GMs were making noises that the bazaar might be implemented.  Haven't been to
Luclin to check this out.
11) It is fairly easy to figure out how to send certain types of communication (such
as /tells) to its own chat window.


The Bad:
1) Looks clunky with all those windows.  Several people were /oocing that they had to
go to a different screen resolution.  
2) The windows fade away when the mouse isn't on them.  Hitting the ~ key doesn't
lock in a transparency anymore.  The chat window can be very hard to read, when the
background of it fades in and out (the text doesn't fade, however).  The fade away
effect _can_ be disabled, but it's not intuitive how to do it.  
3) The icon for the item you have in your range slot doesn't show up on your range
attack button.  Be careful if you have a stat item there you _don't_ want to throw. I
/feedbacked this.
4) Doesn't seem that you can see your group members mana.  Too bad, I was hoping.
5) All the windows go away when zoning, then reappear.  Not that big of a deal, but I
didn't like it.


The Ugly:
1) Lag in the open windows, my friends.  Selling is a pain in the ass.  Tradeskills
are worse.  Made me think of turning off the new interface.  As I type, Lenny has
logged back on (test server crashed for about 10 minutes).  He says this is better
now.
2) Cap locks now works in chat windows.  Yes, WE ARE GOING TO BE SEEING ALOT OF
SHOUTING.  I /feedbacked asking them to take this away, PLEASE.
3) Bald female wood-elves at the character select screen when creating a new
character.  Ugh.

The Funny:
They took away the Jaggedpine Forest zone for a while on test.  Some people were
bound there.  Ooops!

Annie <--- Done typing.  Must go play more!
