"Patch Day" is the name VI gives us to trick the EQ population. The actual
name of days like these is "Real Life Day".

It's the day when VI employees go outside, verify that there is a sun and
fresh air, go and visit their families (those that remember where they left
theirs), and assure each other that, yes, they have a life.

According to thier super secret documents, they feel we will take the same
actions.
