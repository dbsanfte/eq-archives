I can now see all 30 items for sale at the same time.  And it was decreed

This was not an exploit (er, umm, functionality issue), was it?  Was anyone
able to PP or Beg from a vendor?  Actually, the only way to stop begging is
have a command (like /whot, only /beggart) that adds a muzzle counter to a
char and as soon as it reaches some magic number (say, 1), the char is
muzzled and cannot say anything for a certain amount of in-game time.
