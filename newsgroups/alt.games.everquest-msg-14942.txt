Well, you still got the xp.

And you didn't lose the skill in 1HS that you might have got, since the
time you save not fighting that mob and not having longer downtime
because someone finished it off quickly can be spent fighting another
mob. So I think the guy did you a favour. Maybe his attitude was
abrasive after the event, but then so was yours - look at it from his
point of view, he was probably just rubbed up the wrong way by someone
getting upset after he'd helped them.

Well, according to the Verant PNP from
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp :

> You may not steal kills.

So according to that, technically yes, it is killstealing. However, you
haven't lost out on anything like xp or loot, and furthermore:

> The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill

seems to fall in the realm of honest mistake.

back to ryouseika:
> - and b) should I have reported him?

I suppose you could be a rules lawyer under the above bit of the PNP,
but I doubt that a GM would do anything under the circumstances.
