Entry to the Hole. Six spawns that the two of you can handle. Shaman
should be prepared to mostly just be hasting you, slowing the mobs, then
healing like crazy. Rooting them so they stay on you and not on the
shammy would be a "Good Thing" (tm).  Bring range/throwing weapons to
have the best chance of single pulls. Otherwise FD to break the pairs
until you get them all broken in a good order. 21 minute respawn there
on the six mobs and all will be full blue to you at 50. They started
turning light blue for me at 53/54 but the XP was still insane in their
with the ZEM that the Hole has.
