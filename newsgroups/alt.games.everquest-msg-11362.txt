Can anyone give me any idea's as to the best way to catch the Ghoul
messenger?  I have already found him, killed him and collected my sword, but
now a friend of mines wants to do the quest too.  I happened across the
critter quite by accident, on a run to save a lil dwarf being killed by
something nasty, so when my friend asked me where I hunted the ghoul, I
said........er no idea.  I have looked through various quest info's on a few
websites and followed what they recommended, but as yet haven't had any
success at finding the ghoul again.  Anyone tell me of a good place to wait
for him?  I know he spawns around 11pm

Next question....  Money!  I am not doing to bad at the moment, earning
around 50pp every few hours in PAW.  But its about time I upgraded my
armour, I want Ry'gorr, and have enough for the breastplate but nothing
else, anyone tell me where I can hunt and earn better than around 10-15pp
per hour (real time).  By the way, I ain't looking for a nasty place to
hunt, somewhere I can handle fairly well at my level would be best, as this
is my hell lvl and I don't wanna be dying every few mins lol.

Hope someone out there can help  : )
