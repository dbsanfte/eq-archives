I use to play a lvl 49 SK troll for awhile. SK's due have a nice way to taunt
without ever using the taunt button....cast a low lvl dot and that seems to
work almost everytime...i can really speak on the 50+ uber game...but it worked
for me in most groups i was in....One thing SK's are great for is grouping with
shamans in duo's. Fear kiting + shaman dots = dead mobs!!!  I will say you may
want to re think the Edu choice i played a troll..but i hear Ogres make the
best SK..no front stun!!!
