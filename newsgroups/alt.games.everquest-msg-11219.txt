It can't "summon" your corpse, but it can show you where it is...

Target yourself (or if you want to help someone else find their
corpse, target them) and then right-click on the rod (it has to be
in a main inventory slot at the time you right-click on it, it
won't do anything if you right-click it when it's in a container).

This will instantly spin you to point DIRECTLY in the direction
of the corpse.  For outdoor areas, that's all you need -- start
walking forward (without touching either the left or right
"turn me" keys), and eventually you'll trip over the corpse.

For indoor areas, or outdoor areas with a lot of obstacles in
your way, you may have to detour around walls or mountains,
in which case you'll lose your "corpse location fix" and you'll
have to fire the Chipped Bone Rod again to point you back at
the corpse.  Repeat as necessary (but remember that the Rod
can only be used three times, then you need to buy a new one).
