I found this interesting and can't quite figure out what happened here. 
Was in TT camping the hunter/forager for the Seb key and got a little 
bored. So I decide to sneak/hide over to the entrance to Seb to scout it 
out a bit. Clicked on the big red ball and actually zoned in! Anyone 
have a clue how I got in? I only had the hunter medallion and my 
lockpicks were in my bag. Have they changed this recently? Is a key no 
longer required? If so, is HS the same? I'd really rather not waste time 
on keys if I don't need to.
