Well, I dinged my baby Bardette to 25 last night and am thoroughly enjoying
playing her for the social utility aspect of playing, but I have to face the
fact that this bard career is proberly going to be ending soon as I lack the
required personal (not character) dexterity to play a Bard effectively.

So far I have been soloing as I am aware that just as a good bard in
invaluable to a group, a poor bard is completely and utterly useless. The
biggest problem is that I can only half concentrate on my surroundings and
twist 2 songs at a time, 3 would be out of the question (Genetics is a
bitch... my whole family is pretty unco and low bandwidth). At the moment,
swapping intruments is still beyond me, but I can tell this would be
possible in future with a lot of practice (on 2 song twisting only).

The biggest question is what sort of level barrier would I roughly be
looking at for a Soloing 2 song twisting bard? I am guessing the mid
thirties myself but then again, I am Chimp so that could be way off. My aims
for this character is as a guild/friend downtime minimiser, so its the
health and mana songs are going to be all important. This is not going to be
a "Battle Bard" in any way shape or form, she disbands when the group goes
into action. But then again, level aquired directly affects the songs a bard
get's as well so if it is too low she will be useless even in that limited
role.

Is it worth continuing her? Or should I just shelve her and start up a druid
or shaman for social playing in much the same role? The advantages of a
druid or shaman is that there will be no end level limitations as given
enough time even I could level these right up....Well, maybe : )
