If you had a wood elf or halvling with max wisdom (druid should always
max wisdom, no other stat really matters) you'd have at 115 wisdom
which would mean with the testament alone you'd have 125 wisdom.
Therefore you are one of those races and did not max wis or possibly a
human or, horror of horrors a half elf. If you are a half elf you are
going to have trouble getting very high widom until you are getting
planes/velious type armor. 

that being said there are some pretty cheap wis things you could get:

Legs gatorscale leggings (camp self in guk or buy for maybe 900 plat
or less) 4 wis.
OR
Get those friends at work to help you do the kromriff military
leggings quest for 5 wis no drop legs.

BP ulthork bp 3 wis and 30 mana (quite nice) and probably can buy for
less than a nature's shroud or mith runed tunic. Ulthork bp is from
man o'wars who are blue to a level 55 still. With friends may be able
to do them at 29 maybe. Kill walruses until some spawn way south (the
higher level walruses) in Eastern wastes.

Ulthork arms, 3 wis very nice, can buy or get self from the ulthorks
up north in eastern wastes (the lower level(non man 0'war) ones way up
north by shore and the giant jail area)

Golden efritti boots 9 wis or something, now down to like 3 k on some
servers which is not totally out of your range possibly at level 29.
Some lower level nice boots are now in crystal caverns which will be
good for you in groups now or soon, also in cc:

A nice dropping wis belt that is 4 wis or something, I forget off
which spawn but I think it can be any of a certain type orc you can
certainly kill in a group. My 34 -35 sk was soloing there quite well
on the orc spawns and they were all blue.. so you in a group would be
fine. Its really great xp also.

With pottery people can now make a wisdom diety range slot thing.

Wood elf smiths can now make a 2 wis or something mace which is imbued
to be either karana or tunare. I was making these for a while and
selling them in seconds to players at 200 plat a pop (hmm reminds me..
I have a ton of morning dew in bank right now.. :) )

Forest loops, not only do they drop off higher giants but my troll sk
soloing on them when still blue in warsillks wood at the fort around
level 29 or so got a couple. So I'd try there in a group if you can't
do them solo (easier with one okay armored melee type with you) They
are 2 ac 3 wis. 

One nice thing about forest loops if you are not aware: They always
have a nice value since to a VENDOR with good faction/charisma they
sell for about 290 or 300 plat. I was trying to sell one at auction
one day for 200 plat and no player was buying.. I went to sell to a
vendor and it had offer of like 290 plat.. ahaha.

Liz mantle from cazic or that 5 wis druid only shoulder from kith both
have good wis also. Both are sold pretty cheap by players.

Runed mithril bracers are good and pretty cheap now I think, etc and
so on.
