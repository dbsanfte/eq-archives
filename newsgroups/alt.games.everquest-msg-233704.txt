This isn't 100% reliable.  Once in a while, a Guardian / Protector will
spawn and be able to see invis.  I haven't seen it with a Sentry, yet, but I
wouldn't bet against it.  It's fairly rare, but it happens and it's not an
NPC that's been charmed and had See Invis cast on it nor has it been given a
See Invis item.

The little armor guys ( the ones the Necros / Chanters can DC ) near the
entrance may be able to see invis as they are undead.  They're usually not
up when I run by.
