Unless you were on Luclin or an equally civilized server (Torv the only
other one with a respected list I believe), you had to be lucky (ie not
sniped) or uberguild (ie doing the sniping or just mobilizing faster =)) to
get the SolB Ragefire. That hasn't changed, really. hat HAS changed is that
there's going to no more sitting in a room for 80 hours going mad, then
having 'your camp' 'stolen'. Now it's just a straight race to engage. It
doesn't even matter if you wipeout against this RF, since you are not
risking all your work on your epic.

And 56+ Kunark spells are going to get a lot more common =)
