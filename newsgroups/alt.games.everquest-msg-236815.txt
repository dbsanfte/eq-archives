Once upon a time I was a foolish young necromancer, who in the excitment of
working on the prayer shawl quest though it would be fun to become a gm
tailor.  Acrtic wyver was my skill up route of choice, so I spent many an
hour on the shores in Cobalt Scar fishing away for Cobalt Cod.  Once I came
to my senses and realized that tailoring is pure evil suckled from the cold
teat of Innoruuk himself, I was able to sell the several stacks of remaining
cod oil I had for 50pp each in the bazaar.  The weight of the coin offset to
some extent the pain caused by making velium studs.  I'm now a gm smith and
very glad I realized the evils of tailoring.
