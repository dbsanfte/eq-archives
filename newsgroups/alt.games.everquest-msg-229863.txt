Not worth it get to 13.

No it goes up pretty fast, I recommend you get a quick 1HS and 1HB and
practice. Frankly, max your Pierce first. A lot of people don't max
1HS and fewer max 1HB. One other skill most neglect is the throwing
skill, where you can do crist and deady strikes, not for much damage,
but a little, great for pulling and sneck pulling.

Well I would go for level forst, but too many people go for level
FIRST. Good Rogues know they are useful because of skill, Level is
just a qualifier. Get pick pocket, Pick locks, sense and detect traps,
and sneak and hide maxed every level.

I would NEVER advise a rogue to get Power levels, and I just as much
not have one level in Pal caverns.

Skills is the game for a Rogue, not level, but 1hs goes up fast when
you have a secondary.
