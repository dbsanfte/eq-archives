I once read an article that seemed to dig deeper in tradeskill fails
formula's. Basically every item has an innate fail that is always present
and the rest is determined by skill on an logaritmic scale. If you get more
skill over the trivial it will give more chance, but the effect is very
small, smaller then the innate chance basically.

For example metal bits that trivial at 20 skill.
(These are totally fictive numbers btw)
Assume an innate fail of 5%

at skill 1 you have about 5% innate + 94% chance at fail (99%)
at skill 5 you have about 5% innate + 84% chance at fail (89%)
at skill 10 you have about 5% innate + 70% chance at fail (75%)
at skill 15 you have about 5% innate + 45% chance at fail (50%)
at skill 20 you have about 5% innate + 5% chance at fail (10%)
at skill 100 you have about 5% innate + 2% chance at fail (7%)
at skill 250 you have about 5% innate + 1% chance at fail (6%)

The innate makes certain combines simply not profitable, even with extremly
higher skill. This is the reason why 2 items with the same trivial often
have different failure rates.

I do not have a link anymore because the page is gone, but this is what I
understood of the article and it seems pretty accurate.
