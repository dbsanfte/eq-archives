Hmmm...I haven't bought Planes of Power yet, so my impression is entirely
based on what I've read, mostly here...but the impression I get, when the
above is combined with the flags and the way you access the various planes
makes me think it should have been named Planes of Mario. :-)

I haven't decided if I'll get PoP.  Companies with successful games tend to
go through two phases.  The first phase is where the goal is to produce a
great game, because that will be the most fun for the players.  Yeah, the
real goal is to make money, but the people making the game decisions are
driven be the game--when making money and making a great game are at odds,
they *want* to pick the game, but concede some to making money because the
guys in suits make them do it. :-)  The second phase is where making money
is what drives the people making the game decisions.  Where a great game and
making money are at odds, they go for making money, without the suits having
to tell them.  Verant is showing signs of phase two.
