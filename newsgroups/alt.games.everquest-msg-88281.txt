 "Pretty sure I won't be your Valentine this year "


Ahh the ol' rhetorical English and Composition check :-) You sure got
suckered on that one. hehe
 Too easy and out right funny. You fail to address the replies, you resort
to spelling and grammar ? Sign of anger and weakness in any form. You lost
your touch, or does the sight of me just touch a nerve ? Loosing your cool
for sure :-)
 Your too easy and very predictable LuLu, I am a tad disappointed.

GetsumJ 1, Loudmouth -0

 BTW, How do I know your a Female and Canadian ?

You are what I say you are so get used too it. Fact is, I make you what I
want and not really much you can do about it. Stop me ?  Oh pleeaaase, we
been that road and you always reply till you block me like last time. What I
say catches your attention and forces you to defend yourself too no end. You
find that you are a bit worried that someone doesn't treat your words like
EF-Hutton. It is very disappointing too you and you understand me not. You
know two things,
 GetsumJ don't like Lokari, and Lokari is very uncomfortable with that
dislike. Your reign is being threatened and you look kinda worried. Kinda
Ironic don't ya think ?


 Why is my Websters so dusty, yet yours is worn out ?

 Cmon, spell check me some more. My grammar is rough, my spelling is tough,
and your nerves are shattered :-)

 Have a nice day , I know I will :-)

Your Valentine :-)
GetsumJ
