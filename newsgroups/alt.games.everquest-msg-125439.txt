Scorsese score

Speaking of roundups: We really, really thought we had mercifully
retired our long-running feature spotlighting songs about movie stars.
But we did not want to ignore a couple of late-breaking suggestions:

A reader whom we know only as "batchild1" e-mailed to apprise us of a
song called "Martin Scorsese," by King Missile. It's quite a tribute.
Sample lyric: Then I'd pick him up by the hair swing him over my head
a few times.

And the redoubtable Lou Curtiss of Folk Arts Rare Records writes in to
say: "Wouldn't be right if you didn't have some old-timers."

His candidates: Vernon Dahlhart's "There's a New Star in Heaven
Tonight--Rudolph Valentino" (recorded in 1926, Curtiss says); and Bill
Cox and Cliff Hobbs' recording of "The Last Flight of Will Rogers and
Wiley Post," from the mid-'30s.

And that's really the last flight of "Star Songs," too.
