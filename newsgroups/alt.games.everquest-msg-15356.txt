Clearly you are harassing me. This is harassment. I feel harassed. You are
harassing me based on my race/age/sex/religion.sexual preference/disability.
I am suing you under the Americans With Disabilities Act/Civil Rights
Act/National Parks Act of 1978. Your lawsuit is an extension of this
harassment.

If there are any others in this newsgroup who have been harassed or sexually
assaulted by Graefaxe, based on your race/age/sex/religion.sexual
preference/disability, contact me so we can file a class action lawsuit.

That's CLASS action, buddy!
