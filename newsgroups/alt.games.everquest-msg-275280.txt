I don't see why the MT should be in a better position that anybody else to
decide when to run? A far more important parameter is playing experience,
and the group leader should always be one of the more experience players.
I'm quite a newbie myself, and if I have brought a group together and sense
that someone would likely be a better leader than myself, I always suggest
him/her to take over.
