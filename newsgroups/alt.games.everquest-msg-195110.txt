Hubby and I are talking about returning to EQ sometime in the future when
we have new computers.  One thing I'm looking forward to is continuing on
my husband's cudgel quests (mmmm, mana-less mini avatar...*ranger drool*).  
He once had the idea of being the first Vah Shir Shaman on Xev with the
8th cudgel.  Well, it may be too late for that, but he could still be
among of the first.  We were held up at the 7th one before we quit,
though, because we could never get the right group into Charasis to get
the skulls.  A ranger/shaman duo is tricky because, if there is danger
(you really don't want to do a CR in charasis...I'd rather flee like a
cowardly varmint), I have to use a gate potion that will potentially take
a long time to get back from (quicker with pop boiks, though).  Not to
mention a gate potion that takes so long to cast it'll probably be
interrupted.

This brings me to thinking longingly of the gate hammer.  It would take me
Real Close to Charasis.  Of course, killing in charasis ruins the faction
that you use to get the gate hammer. And I currently don't have amiable
faction there.  However, let's say I was able to get amiable to the
outpost in OT.  Is the gate-point of the hammer out of the way of mobs
that would be able to destoy a 58 ranger?  IE, could I get the hammer, and
then happily destroy my faction without worrying?

Assuming that is possible, next question is...how do I get faction at the
outpost?
