All this has been an interesting read, and it only affects my grouping 
for LDoN one way:  it doesn't.  I was only curious on how the points were 
awarded, nothing more.  However, I have been in a string (4 or 5) of 
groups that I think we really should have gone with a hard adventure 
with.  I mean, finishing a kill 55 with 50 minutes left, and killing the 
REST of the mobs in dungeon in less than 20 min...well, I thought we 
shoulda done hard last night.  If we get the same group together again, 
we WILL do a hard adventure, noquestions.

Anyway, thanks all who took the time to answer.  Look forward to 
adventuring some more, and hopefully getting a pally friend of mine into 
LDoN (money issue at this time, but I may break down and get him the 
expansio for Christmas :) )
