Irrelevant to you maybe. To others they are important. And all of the 
expansion so far have been free.

Note that CS is run by NCSoft, *not* by Cryptic studios. Despite what 
NCSoft says, if you mention it in the forums, a dev will see it. Maybe 
not respond, but they will see it.

As I said, it is too minor for *me* to be overly concerned with. I tend 
to scan through the forums fairly frequently, and KSing is not something 
that comes up at all. As with any game, if the problem is big enough, 
people would howl as loud as they could on the forums and the devs would 
hear about it. When Issue 2 went live, and there was a bug that had all 
the mission mobs spawning at +1, the devs heard about it pretty fast on 
the official forums. The same happens with anything that is wrong, or is 
perceived as being wrong.

Based on the fact that there are not very many people screaming about it 
in the forums, I can feel confident in saying that the problem is, IMO,  
minimal at best and not really worth their time doing something about it. 
But I can only base that on the forums and on *my* experiences. I know 
that the forums are not the best cross-section to compare to, but between 
there and here, I think it is a pretty good pulse on the mood of the 
game. You may have a completely different experience than I have had in 
the game wrt KSing, so I can respect that your opinion (on importance) 
may be different than mine.

Well, as with anything, you have to read with a grain of salt and common 
sense. Once you apply your 1337-speak filter, it is pretty easy to see 
what the real problems are and what is just people being bitchy and 
whiney.
