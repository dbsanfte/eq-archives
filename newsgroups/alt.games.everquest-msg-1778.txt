Low summons max for 16, highs max for 20.  So I'd need to give it
something that hits for 9-11, not too much in that neighborhood
without going to 2hs...  Will I benefit from giving it a rusty
2hander?

I tried giving a pet a weighted axe once, the results were not
impressive.

A level _45_ friend of mine accidentally gave a mage pet a Ykeshan War
club instead of the rightful owner she was passing it to.  We got a
lot of mileage out of that pet, we couldnt stand to see it dismissed
and the GMs told us they couldnt help.  =)

Noted.
