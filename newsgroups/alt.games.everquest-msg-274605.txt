I actually agree both (a) that good/evil are not absolute and shouldn't
be enforced by the game (though I do enjoy the challenge of dealing with
it to the extent the game DOES enforce it, in the Old World at least,
through factions), and (b) that in on-line role-playing, just as in
face-to-face RP, it's important to remember that there's a real person
behind the character, and that person is presumably NOT "evil" even if
the character is.

Nevertheless, I also agree that the game is generally more fun if people
make just a little bit of effort to put things in terms of the game world.
So in your situation, you might have tried:

/shout Guards! Guards! Some invisible ne'er-do-evils are infiltrating
the city!  Oh why don't you ever listen to me?  Well, those do-gooders
had better be careful not to let themselves get caught!

I'll bet the other group would've had a good chuckle out of that. :-)
