Well it can be hard when you first start playing the game, and as
somebody else said, level 5 is kind of a crummy level, too high for
the newbie areas but not high enough for some of the mobs in the next
zones over.  But I think the Everfrost Peaks newbie (Halas barbarian
newbie area) might be a good area; a lot of the polar bear cubs,
wolves and wooly spiderlings should still be blue to you; just watch
out for the vengeful skeletons (vengeful composer, etc.) that like to
wander through.  

But actually it used to be a LOT harder for newbies a couple of years
ago.  It used to be that newbie characters only got 5 food and water
(now they get 20).  Also, between levels 1 and 4 when you died you
only got your newbie weapon and your food/drink back, but had to go
find your body to loot the rest of your stuff; and when you died after
level 4 you didn't even get your weapon or your food/water.  Also,
until you reached level 6, you only had 30 minutes to find your corpse
to get your stuff back or else your corpse would vanish and you would
lose all your stuff.  You also started losing experience about level
7.  Now newbies don't have to worry about looting their corpses till
level 10 and don't start losing experience till level 11.  

I remember one time when I first got the game and didn't have a clue;
I had some new character I had made, I think a high elf paladin or
high elf wizard or something like that, and I started wandering around
not knowing where I was going and wound up zoning in to Lesser
Faydark.  I still didn't know where I was going and kept wandering
around, then all of a sudden I see "A brownie scout begins to cast a
spell"--"A brownie scout begins to cast a spell", then shortly
afterwards I was dead.  I remember deleting that character right after
that!

Also, with PoP it's a lot easier to travel.  Before PoP, people had to
either take the boats and run, or else try to find a druid or wizard
who would be willing to port them, and some only would port for a fee
which was more than some newbies could afford.

Also, regarding the NPCs that ignore you--only certain NPCs will have
quests to give (where they're saying stuff in [brackets]).  You can
check out:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

for the lists of quests in each zone and which NPCs give the quests.

Hope this helps.
