Agreed in full.

Agreed there as well. However, I imagine station runs on the same boxen 
www.sony.com does, which is masked by load balancers. Traceroutes to both 
stop after eth0.nywf1.sonyonline.net (an ethernet interface on a router in 
New York). It's simply more cost effective to do it that way.

Bad assumption. Assume instead that a user uses l33t passwords- p@ssw0rd 
and stuff like that, all of which will be covered by a good cracker.

They should not. They should, however, be a bit more sympathetic to those 
that pay their paychecks.

Why? Probably the same reason I bother, daily, with a web server farm that 
attracts at most a few million visitors per day.
