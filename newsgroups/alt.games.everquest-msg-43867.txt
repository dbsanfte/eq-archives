No stuns?  They're some of the most useful spells that a cleric recieves,
stopping mob healing spells, gates and/or saving some damage while hurting the
mob a bit.  They're also dirt cheap to cast.

My level 30 cleric's lineup looks along these lines.

Greater Heal
Healing
Stun 1 (no damage)
Stun 2
Enstill
Nuke / undead nuke
Divine Aura
Divine Barrier

When it comes time to buff, I switch out a spell for that.  Usually the root
or the nuke.
