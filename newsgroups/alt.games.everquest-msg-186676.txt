Win95 evolved from a cooperative effort between Microsoft and IBM.

In the mid-80's, IBM and Microsoft entered into an agreement to work
together on a new operating system.  IBM brought the skillset to the table
to created a true multitasking environment (rather than the preemptive
multitasking of Windows 3.0) ... Microsoft brought the skillset to the table
to provide a Windows 3.0-like user interface for IBM's new multitasking
environment.  The child of this marriage was OS/2.

OS/2 had it's faults ... mainly the hundreds of setting that had to be
tinkered with for each DOS app to work.  The refinements continued until
OS/2 1.3, at which time Microsoft pulled out of the agreement ... in
essence, they took their ball and went home.

IBM pressed forward with OS/2, releasing OS/2 2.0 and OS/2 Warp ... but IBM
couldn't sell water in a desert.  They steadfastly refused to listen to the
folks who used OS/2 say that there were too many settings to be adjusted.
Sales suffered, and only a few of the major players of the time (Lotus,
WordPerfect) made OS/2-specific apps.

Microsoft, on the other hand, took the knowledge they had gleaned from IBM
and created an environment that was almost the same as OS/2 structurally.
However, having heard (and listened) to the folks who tried to use OS/2 (and
I was one of them ... on a screaming i486/50 with 32 megs of RAM), they
removed the necessity for adjusting settings (at the expense of declaring
that some DOS apps simply would not work) and added a few bells and
whistles.  This operating system was Windows 95.

So, you're absolutely correct, DK.  Win95 was not revolutionary at all.  It
evolved from OS/2 1.3.

Ben will argue with this, I'm sure.
