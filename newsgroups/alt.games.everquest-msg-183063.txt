The mana efficiency is huge if the pet buff part lasts an hour and a half
like
caster's realm lists it. Burn out 3 is only 15 minutes, meaning you really
have to keep it
memmed all the time to keep it on the pet. With EE i can swap it out with my
other buff
phantom armor and cast them both at once and have another slot when fighting
that
was used for BO3.
