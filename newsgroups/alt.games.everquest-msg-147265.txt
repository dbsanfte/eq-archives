It's not even a question of trust in my mind.  Are you expecting him to keep
your characters and equipment intact?  What if he upgrades / levels alot and
doesn't want to give it all up when you are ready to come back?  This is
almost, in my mind, like loaning money:  Only do it if you won't care if you
don't get it back.
