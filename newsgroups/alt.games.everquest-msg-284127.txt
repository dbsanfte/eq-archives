I can't be 100% certain, of course, but I haven't noticed any distinct
improvements in my ability to hold aggro with my BABS from the moment
I started using it with skill 0 to now when I have about 75, nor did I
notice it becoming harder when I switched out my previous Bull
Smasher/Bronze Dagger combo, where I had 1hb maxed and piercing
reasonably high.  So I'd say weapon skill doesn't affect aggro much,
if it does at all.

This is my strategy, and it seems to be working - I pretty much only
lose aggro when the wizards start getting nuke-happy, and unless the
mob is red it's usually fairly easy to taunt it back on me.  And
that's without Provoke, which I don't have yet as I got to 20 in South
Karana.
