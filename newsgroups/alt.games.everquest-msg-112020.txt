I find this post misleading in the extreme. While it is true that a chanter
(or necro versus undead) can charm , haste there pet and slow the attack
speed of a mob and thus continually kill with it, it is not so true for a
druid. The druid pet buff is short lived , and they have no good way to
mitigate the dammage on a charmed pet. As a druid using charm the best
method remains to find 2 blue mobs and charm one , slightly dammage the
other letting the pet do the brunt of the tanking and then when charm breaks
finnishing off your all but dead pet. It is still risky, only works in areas
with animals , and results over time in less exps per time period then root
dotting.
