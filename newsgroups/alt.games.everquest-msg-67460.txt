If I can find any... :) I did notice that HGs in Rathe Mountains seem to
have higher MR than giants in North Karana, or perhaps it's just a
matter of having been lucky picking a few low blues in a row (are there
any low blue HGs to a level 35?) and then running into a high blue.

Oh well... I don't really need the money, and if they are available,
Griffons are an easier XP source. :)
