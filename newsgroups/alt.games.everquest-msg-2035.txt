...if the only thing that was changed was the amount of space it
filled, nope, not a single complaint. The amount of space it fills is
irrelevant, what is relevant is WHAT fills that space.

And how did the CD not expand the game? It did what was advertised,
plus a few things that were advertised.

>Not expansion content AND a couple "free" games.

WOuld you rather the extra capacity be left empty?

On what planet?

No, it shows that they didn't expect their customers to be snot-nosed,
whiney brats who have unrealistic expectations. How silly of them.
