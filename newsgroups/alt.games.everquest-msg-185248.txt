i've read several places that enchanter nukes have a stun component.
and indeed, whenever i nuke a Giant, i get the message "your target
is immune to the stun portion of this effect."

but whenever i nuke a normal mob, it never sees to *actually get
stunned*.  the mob immediately starts swinging on me, without any
period of stun.

i looked it up on lucy, and indeed, the enchanter nukes contain a
stun component -- of 0.0 seconds duration.

why is this?  just to increase the aggro?
