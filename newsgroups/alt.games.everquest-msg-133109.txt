Nope.  I never quite made it.  I only made 27.  I kept ending up in
groups that got me killed.  (I haven't parsed my log yet, but I wouldn't
be surprised if I have had more than 8 deaths since Wednesday.) 
However, on Saturday night, when my guild leader found out in my
attempts to reach 30, I went 3 days with only 8 hours of sleep, he told
to go to bed and that I could go on the raid.  It was a lot of fun.  We
only got a couple rare drops.  I didn't win any rolls, but it was a lot
more fun than just camping a static spawn for hours on end.  And I did
get a pouch of fire dust(?) that I can use in the Warden of Tunare
quest. (I'm writing this from work, so I'm not sure on the exact
details.)  I think I did a good job though, my group was the only group
that didn't have a death.  (I don't count the guy who fell in the lava,
there was nothing I could do about that.)  I'd definitely do it again,
although I wish the god of luck would smile on me a bit more on the
rolls.
