1-10?

Try 1-55 lol :)

I didn't have much to do last night, bumped into a friend at Thurg bank on
her lil ranger, gave her some armour and took her to the giant fort...  beat
the mobs down and FD'd, she killed it and i got the faction hit (ie no exp
for her) hmm a bad fd..  so i do it again, and again, and again.. 7 fd's on1
mob and I still got the faction hit (i didnt play last night so I need to
investigate FD some more)

Decided a more surefire way was to log my cleric and wiz on (58 and 59),
targetted myself and cast heroic bond (else shes too low level to cast it
on) had to use SoW and Naltron cuz she was too low level for anythin else,
then she'd pull a mob, melee it to just over 50% while i healed, then I'd
blast it on my wiz to kill it but not take exp

Thats pleveling in a nutshell, some people don't like it but I dont think
their point is valid when your an experienced level 60..

monk: 60 - not pleveled at all
wizard: 59 - not pleveled at all
cleric: 58 - not pleveled at all
mage: 50 - not pleveled at all

So I don't think anybody can begrudge me my SK: level 53, troll with exp
penalty, less then 10 days played, totally pleveled :)

Pleveling also gives you a chance to get other skills up.. e.g defence and
melee skills as a caster
