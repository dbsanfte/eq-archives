The trick to selling them is to listen out for anybody wanting to buy spider
silks - these people are usually working on tailoring and will probably take
them off your hands.
Two zones i frequently find buyers to sell to are:-
Everfrost (lots of silk and hq bear drops)
East karana (crag spiders - often hunted for silks) 

Both of these zones you could hunt in to get exp, and sooner or later you'll
come across a buyer.

They finally discovered a food that reduces a womens sex drive-
Its called wedding cake.
