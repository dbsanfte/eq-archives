Admirable. Getting out of KC is a very good move.

There's the rub. KC and DL are they way they are because they are easy
and readily accessible places which the lamest idiots can reach with no
problems. However, that makes them the most attractive, and hence the
easiest place for pickup groups. Sadly, the good places generally
require bringing a group. But you might try DS or UP up on the moon. I
hear they are getting popular.

As for soloing, how unbelievably uber is your gear? 55 warrior and
"soloing" are not two things often found in the same sentence.

Where ever you get xp is the best place to get "AA points" as they are
just xp going into a different bucket.
