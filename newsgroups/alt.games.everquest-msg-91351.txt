well, as much as I like to jump to conclusion....

400k $10 players
8k $40 players

I think the el cheapo crowd has nothing to worry about, yet, maybe.

And besided, service just to be crap, in all my time on EQ I've rarely seen
a patch go right and when velious came out, there were also a metric butt
load of problems. Things can't get any worse than this, presumably.

Buck up, keep a stiff upper lip and remember that the legends server isn't
up yet either. (or they're not telling us punters).

I personally don't mind at all that they use the legends server to test out
new stuff we're getting later on. Heck, the old test server required us to
invest time. Now the rich lot get to beta trudge through non-functionality
before we get the nifty map screen and the likes.
