No Drop spells for multiple reasons:

1) To prevent people like you from not even buying the expansion.
2) Spells are the weapons of casters, they should be no drop as much as 
any other item is... and I at least think there is a place for a no-drop 
concept in the game... but others differ.
3) To 'encourage' people to play the game. Spells as the result of 
quests or AP for LDoN mean that you have done at least a little more 
with your life in EQ than farm spiderlings...
