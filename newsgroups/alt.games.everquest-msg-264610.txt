You shouldn't have ever thought anything different.

More likely Lucas was unreasonable when it came to negotiating what 
their cut of the All-pass would be. (e.g. They probably wanted the same 
cut they get from the single user version for 100% of the accounts. And 
they probably wouldn't budge. Lucas and unreasonable are synonomous.)

Its too bad, they'd sell a lot more all access passes if they co-bundled 
them. 

I'm stunned that AO/SB/ etc and other smaller unrelated companies 
haven't come out with 'multi-access passes.'

The mmog market is inherently suffocated by its own success. New 
entrants to the market have to compete directly with long time 
established games, and most players only play one or two at the most, at 
least at one time.

It would seriously shrink the mmorpg competition space if one pass got 
you into multiple games. People would pay an incremental extra to get 
access a 2nd game. But in general paying the whole fee over is a double 
negative in that

1) it literally costs twice as much, and this puts an upper limit on the 
number of games one will subscribe to.

2) your perceived value is halved, because you only have so much gaming 
time, and now you are effectively paying twice as much per hour per 
game. This contributes to being dissillusioned with multiple mmogs, and 
is an incitement to cancel whichever one you play the least... because 
your value/dollar ratio is the worst. If you log into game 2 once a 
week, and you pay just as much as game 1 which you play everyday its 
hard to justify game 2.

Further All access passes are in the publishers best interest. The 
players (if its managed correctly) will only be allowed to play one game 
at a time (we don't want people splitting their account, so they play EQ 
while Dad plays EQ2) so their total play time will not increase *and* 
the total revenue will increase. Its a win situation.

They could even set up inter company deals to track usage and break fees 
literally according to percentage time in each game. So there is no risk 
of cannibalizing your own player base.

So if AC is 10/mo, and and AO is 10/mo. And the player is currently only 
playing AC. They buy a dual pass, for 15/mo, and spend 75% of their time 
in AC and 25% in AO... and the AC publisher ends up even (maybe even a 
little ahead because they get the same dollars, but are using less 
bandwidth), while the AO publisher ends up ahead pure and simple. And of 
course, when the AO customer plays a little AC reciprocity kicks in...

And finally players that balk at subscription  games in general might be 
won over by a deal that gives them 3 or 4 games for the price of 2, 
increasing the size of the market as a whole.
