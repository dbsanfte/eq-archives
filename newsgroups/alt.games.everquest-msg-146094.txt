    It may suck, but that's because it's challenging. ;-)

    Yeah, things like backstory are sorely lacking. Well, they exist, but
behind so much timesink bullshit that most people actually got the spoilers
before they discovered the content.

    And "released too early" has never applied to an expansion more than
this one. BUT - would you still consider it unfinished? As at last patch,
it's looking pretty good. Bland in terms of history, but good in terms of
gameplay.

> Could they fuck the faction system up any more?

    The faction system isn't messed up. It's just irrelevant, which is an
even bigger crime. In Velious, you had to make tough choices at first as to
who you wanted to support (later in the expansion you could switch faction
quickly with kills on certain mobs). In Luclin, it doesn't really matter.
Katta faction is pretty much irrelevant, except as a setup for the Lord Seru
fight. And if you kill what you need to kill to get to Seru, you'll have the
faction anyways. Seru factions are only good if you don't like being chased
from Netherbian zone to Mons Letalis zone in Marus Seru.

    And that's not even counting the numerous "you start scowls, they can't
increase, they only go down" factions in Luclin. Why have a Disciples of
Rhag'Zedune faction, if I cannot raise it and start KOS to it? Just so I
know when to stop healing on boss mob encounters? "Oh, took a bunch of
useless faction hits. Fight is over!"

    If you do the Earring of Veracity quest and gear up to kill Seru, you
get the backstory and find out about how the different sections of Seru
don't get along. You also see certain indications in Katta that things
aren't so happy, especially with that Nathyn fellow being undead and all.
But the problem is it only goes as far as the one quest. You'd think they'd
make the system so it actually made a difference which house in Seru you
were with, or have more quests that require Nathyn to like you. But all the
Seru factions do is determine where you need to be invis as you tromp from
house to house, killing to get reports and shards.
