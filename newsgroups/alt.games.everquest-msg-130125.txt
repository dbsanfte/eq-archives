Uhmmm... BANG! (that's the sound of me bursting your bubble)
That's been the stated policy for as long as I've been playing.
LD is either deliberate (in which case, you're a cheat and death is your
reward)... or beyond VIs' control (in which case they're supposed to fix it
how?)

Guides are volunteers... GMs are (poorly) paid staff based/living in San
Diego.
Either way, they're not paid $12.95/month... so why the fuck should they
drop everything to come running just for YOU? You haven't paid for your own
personal guide/GM... so you can shut the fuck up and accept the same service
the rest of us do, or get the fuck out of Norrath!

They already do, they're called GMs, knuklehead
