Well, maybe he will come somewhere after dain_45345353 (i lost count) in
priorities /groan

Didnt realise he was 3 day though (you sure about that?) was told its a 7
day pop.

And who exactly are you tracking from the zoneline?  Maybe I overlooked it,
but he had an exact same name as the rest of the stuff in there (same level
etc) the only difference is he was rooted

We had 3 lvl 60 enchanters there (well 2 bots and a chanter) and just kept
them mezzed.  The MA thought it better to just concentrate on the named,
before bothering with adds.. we had like 8 adds in all though, after that
wonderful train :)

Its also a pain because you can't clearly judge distance/melee box on things
like the giant slime, or even which way they are facing (which is a pain on
enrage)
