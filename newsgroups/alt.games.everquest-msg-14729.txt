Yeah, in your case they are becoming a bit extreme.  There isn't a bug that
you are exploiting.  The onus should be on them to keep these things from
happenning, but you are playing by the rules in the environment they
intentionally setup.  Finding bugs in the code and exploiting is a different
story.
