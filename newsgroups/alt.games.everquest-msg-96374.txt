You didn't know that because it is not correct. Or at least, it was not well
explained. It may work while on your cursor but it certainly works when
equiped in the primary (hand) slot.

Here's the deal:

1) Go to magecompendium.com. There is a pet section that tells you exactly
what pets hit for each and every level and other usefull information. Write
down the maximum damage for a pet of your current summoning capabilities.

2) Summon your pet using focus item if you have it. Focus item needs to be
held, in the primary slot, not just in a bag or other inventory slot. You'll
know this for certain when you get to L34 because if you don't use the focus
your pet not be as large as they should be. The appropriate focus items also
work on all pets from 4-49. After that you need the proper stave of
elemental mastery which will increase your pet by 1 level and works only on
pets from 51-60.

3) Take your new pet out for a test drive. Have "others hits ON" in the chat
filter. Have pet attack something easy to kill (or hard, be brave). Note the
maximum damage your pet does.

4) Compare that maximum damage to the number you wrote down  from
magecompendium.com.

5) If pet does not hit for maximum or 2pts less than maximum you may want to
repeat steps 1-5.
