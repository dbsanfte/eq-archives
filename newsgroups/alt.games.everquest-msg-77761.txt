You've overlooked Flaming Sword of Xuzl, which Wizards get at level
59.  It's similar to the Cleric pet, but has about 150 HP, takes more
mana to cast, and is not buffable.  Oh, and the spell is a mob drop,
rather than a vendor spell.

Wizard's are the class that can surround themselves with the most
entities, I think.  At 59, we could have simultaneously the Flaming
Sword of Xuzl, an Eye of Zomm or an Eye of Tallon, and a familiar.
(And a horse, too, if you want to count that).
