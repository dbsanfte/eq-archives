Yep my 26th lvl druid can take him. I about messed myself when my husband
who had logged in my druid for an item transfer took him on. But he did it
with the aid of one heal from a 19th lvl cleric. But it was very close and
snare wasn't even tried - husband is more of a beat on them and nuke than
snare and dot/kite type, lol.
