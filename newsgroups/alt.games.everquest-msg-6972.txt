Most people will say that Mage pets are much better than Necro pets. I
tend to disagree.....

Mage pets hit harder than Necro pets, BUT Necro pets take less damage
and hit more often. How you may say????? Fear kiting! A Necro uses
darkness and fear to help his pet kill mobs. Since the mob is running
away the pet hits it more often, and doesn't take any damage in
return. The Mage and his pet stand toe-to-toe with the mob and take
more damage overall. This leads to less efficiency and longer down
times for the mage.

You cannot judge a pet or player character by duel performance.
(Unless you only care about duelling)
