West Freeport, in the canals.  Cast Enduring Breath on yourself (to be
safe), and swim into one of the grates, and go watch TV or read a book until
it is time to recast EB.  Angle yourself so your head is out of water, so
you don't drown if you forget to cast EB.

I did something similar, except I had a Fishbone Earring, so didn't have to
worry about EB, and I used Neriak since I'm a Dark Elf.  I just left myself
swiming when I went to bed, and had 200 swimming skill then next morning.
