It disheartens me to see that you understand how a high percentage of your 
posts can be classified, yet, you still post the way you do.  Go back and 
look at your posts from even a small sample - say - the last 2 months.  
Look at how many of them you either outright flamed someone or made 
inferences to them being stupid, idiotic, etc..  It fully backs up my 
statement that you are a condescending asshole.

I'll toss some fish rolls down that hole when you get hungry.  You won't 
thirst since you're probably past the water table.  Maybe a new shovel.

Buh-bye.
