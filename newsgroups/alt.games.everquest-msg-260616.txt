i have had 3 ATI cards in my life and i have had problems with them all.
their customer service policies suck.  after 2 weeks after purchase you have 
to pay for service unless you register, and even then free service is 
limited..  until a few months back their website was impossible to navagite 
and find specific drivers.  in my old computer i have an ATI all in wonder 
card, and every 6 weeks the drivers disappear.  video capture craps out and 
has to be reinstalled.  oh, and the drivers that came on the cd with it are 
not the correct ones for the card.
as far as NVIDIA cards, the only problem ive had was with madden 2003.  the 
graphics arent as sharp with the older nvidia nvidia card i had as opposed 
to the ATI.  but ever since putting the 5700 (yeah, i know its a crappy 
card, but its the best i could afford at the time) ive had no problems with 
any games.
