I've heard of plenty of solo Druids specializing Evocation.  Can't
recall anybody ever saying they'd specialized Conjuration, though
I can certainly see the value if you prefer root/rot as a solo
tactic (which I do).  But, when I've played my Druids, by far the
most common situation in which I find myself hurting for mana is
when grouped as a healer.  And, as grouping is my prefered MO when
playing Druid, I'm more than willing to trade off some soloing
efficiency for the ability to keep my group alive longer in tough
situations.  Besides, as Celaeno has pointed out in the past, it's
best to spec Alt to save mana on all those Roots.  ;)
