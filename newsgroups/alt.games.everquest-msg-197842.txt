Hello all,

I came back after about a year and a half absence because sony sent me a letter
stating I had a free 7 days to come try everything out.  Their tactics worked
and I'll be starting up my subscription again.

However, it is now almost 2:00 central, 1:00 pacific time and I still cant log
onto the game server.  Is it down still? Or is this just from so many people
trying to get on?

Mike
