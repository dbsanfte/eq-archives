Well, this is a little different, but Ive been disconnected frequently
when leaving my vendor on. Not a crash to desktop, just back to the
login screen. Then one day, my vendor was on, and i just happen to
check the screen when I saw a bard going from spot to spot singing
some kind of detrimental song (perhaps wailing opera? =p). I of course
cant prove his true intent, but I interpreted it as him trying to bump
off as many vendors as he could. Later of course, I saw him on as a
vendor.
