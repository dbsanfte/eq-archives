Yeah, turn them in.  It brightens guides' days to have to tell you they
aren't doing anything wrong and you can turn on a filter to protect yourself
from the naughty bits.  :P

Or ignore them and walk away, just like you'd do in real life if you saw a
couple making out beside a building while *still* *not* *doing* *anything*
*illegal*.  Your morals are not (necessarily or define-ably) better than
theirs, please try to avoid that tendency to force them upon others just
because in your opinion you are godlike.
