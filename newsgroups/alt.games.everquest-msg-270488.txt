Oh, so you are privvy to the organizational structure at SOE? Somehow I 
doubt that. I also doubt that a game development division falls under 
the auspices of IT. I would think it most likely that IT and development 
are somewhat separate organizations in any MMO company. I will agree 
with you that Test always falls within the realm of the development 
group however. Have you ever worked in software development Thomas? 
Nothing personal but to anyone who has it is obvious you've reached 
beyond your own experience in making such an incorrect assumption about 
the organization of a software development house.
