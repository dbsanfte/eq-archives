I would presume that it would be the 55 pct total extension since I
don't see the game as going to the trouble of calculating the
extension based on each circumstance that would allow for it (e.g.
calculate for AA then for focus).

I don't know if anyone has advertised their EXT duration including
focus. If they did then they must be doing the AA EXT + Focus EXT =
TOTAL EXT for I don't ever recall seeing odd EXT pcts.

It never occurred to me that Enchanters might not have an Extended
Enhancement focus item, though I am sure many do. I have taken to
having my mage summon various focus items for my druid since he's
started to outlevel the easily purchased focus items and he is
mana-dependant for effectiveness.
