Starting another channel would not have been good, people would have had to
hear about it and know it to join the conversation, and lets face it, most
would not join the channel.

That is what it is for, and anyone who doesn't want to hear it can turn it
off.

On a different note, I was in a multi-party group in Umbral Plains the other
day, we setup our raidchannel as UMBRALV and we happily calling assists and
heals and incoming in the channel. Then another multi-party group shows up
and starts using SHOUT for all their communication.

I sent out a simple "/ooc wow, those custom channels sure are nice, aren't
they" ok, it was sarcastic, but it was meant to be a friendly reminder that
they should do this. reply I got back was "if you don't want to hear us,
turn shout off". This isn't an option, since I'm sure if they had a train
they would "/shout TRAIN" of course I couldn't hear it. How rude of them.
would have taken 3 seconds for them to fix it.
