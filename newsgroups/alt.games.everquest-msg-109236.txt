As a caster I have about 5 hotkey banks filled with 1 extra for off-time
things. I know some druid and shaman friends have even more because of their
number of spells and quick access to them. Just to give an indication:

bank 1: 2 target buttons (MT, ST), spell gems from 5-8, pet attack, pet back
off
bank 2: most pet commands like sit here, guard me, get lost etc, loc, bind
wound
bank 3: item effects, general commands and extra buttons for quick
targeting, also hotkey for CoH command when memmed in slot 1 and the "to be
deceased" key with /yell, groupsay help and /loc :)
bank 4: /book pages.
bank 5: more /book pages and keys to swap with bank 1
bank 6: commands like to chain-cast spells when needed (spells to get skills
up or actually nuke by using 5 /cast x commands to go as fast as I can) and
multiple time fish / sense headings etc.

Although the first 3 banks are useful for combat, 4 and 5 are highly used as
well especially at prep time for raids etc. Also note that I still have to
use the "main" console for invites and disbands. Simply don't have a spot to
dump those :)
I know most sort of by heart, but having a visual conformation that I'm
actually in the correct bank saves a lot of anguish (pressing the "yell/help
me" button over and over instead of "/pet back off" usually gets people very
irritated)
