From worst to best:

Scowls ready to attack = will attack you if you come within aggro range
Glares threateningly   = will attack you if you get very close
Glowers dubiously      = won't attack, but also won't talk to you
Apprehensive           = okay to talk and buy/sell
Indifferent            = "normal"
Amiable                = friendly
Kindly considers you   = more friendly
Warmly                 = very friendly
Ally                   = highest level of friendly with the best deals
