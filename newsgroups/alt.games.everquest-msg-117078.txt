buddy creates an alt toon.  I hop on with my alt (not on his friends list)
and we get ready to go hunting.  I decide to jump on with my Dru main and
buff him good.

My main on his main bud list. I send him several tells to come out to Misty.
He never responds.  I wait...wait...wait.  send another tell...no response.
I wait some more.  Finally get a tell from him.  "wassup?" is all I get.  I
respond to hurry his butt to Misty.  no response.

I go into RV.  I do a /who...he's in the zone...no AFK.  I send another
tell.  nada.  I wait, wait, wait.  I'm now getting pissed.  But, think
there's a decent reason he's not responding.  I think it's either work or
his girlfriend.

finally get another tell, "what are you doing?".  I respond, "waiting for
your ASS."  again, no more response.  he decides to check his ignore
list...all of his friends entries from the main ended up in ignore!

Talk about almost losing our minds.  He was getting just as frustrated as I.
neither of us guessed he ignore list.

passing on...you may run into same problem.
