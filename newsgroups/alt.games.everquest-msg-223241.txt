Thing is, a really good group it doesn't matter what adventure you pick, 
there's more than enough time to kill every mob in the place either way. 
  But low DPS groups, partial groups, may find some of the missions 
quite hard, particularly if they don't get lucky:

Assasination involves a mob which pops in a random location after you've 
killed a certain number of mobs in the dungeon.  If your dungeon splits 
and you've headed the wrong way, most of the mobs you killed to spawn 
him turn out not to be ones you had to kill to get to him.  Luck can cut 
your work in half or double it, depending on the layout of the place and 
the location of the boss.

Rescue is the same objection, but more so; a stealthy team can move 
around dungeons skipping mobs at will and do an assasination, but for 
rescue you are going to have to clear that path like it or not.

Thats half the jobs out there, which means you will have to ask twice on 
average to get a job you like.

Collection involves randomness too; the distribution of items is 
unpredictable, I've seen ten mobs go by with no drop when they'd been 
dropping every second one more or less for 40 mobs.  I've heard that its 
possible to kill every mob and still not come up with a full set, but 
I've never seen this.

Cut out this job, though, as well and now you have to ask an average of 
4 times to get what you want.

Slaughter is simple and straightforward; kill mobs till you've killed 
enough.  Its easy to see how well you are doing and all you have to be 
able to do is find mobs and kill them, one at a time, many at a time, 
whatever you like.  I'm amazed bards aren't busily soloing this mission 
type.  But groups that don't kill fast might not want to get this one, 
compared to sneaking in and taking out one target it can be a bitch.

Question to me is, why do they force us to ask and reask and reask, with 
a delay in between?  Why not let people ask for the mission type they 
want, and then stick them with their choice to whatever degree of 
randomness you like, but they don't know what it is till they get it?

I've done all 4 types of missions at least a couple times now, with 
several collection and slaughter... oddly the one I've done most is the 
one people seem to like least, collection... and the reason for this is 
because one group I go with frequently is good enough that we don't 
really care which mission we get, and we seem to get collect a lot.
