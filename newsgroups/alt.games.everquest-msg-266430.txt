I think his AA's and playtime are fairly common, and certainly not out of
synch for where he and his guild were.

They were a high end guild yes, but at the forefront of zones and content,
no.  Why is ultra hardcore playtime required, when your not in a race?

EQ isn't really rocket science... with enough of class X, Y and Z, relevant
gear, and either persistance or skill (or both) sooner or later you will
overcome any mob in your path.  They werent doing server/game firsts, or
even in the running for them really, they just have a solid core that allows
continuos raiding and progression.

A lot of my guild wouldn't fit your criteria of hardcore either.. just
looking at cleric AA's on the server.. our clerics have 412, 633, 560, 811,
268, 372, 452, 368, 384.  Some of them are casual raiders, some of them are
high 90's% raiders.  The number of people with 100% attendence in my guild
for any 30 days has never been more than like 4 people.  2 hours, 1 hour, or
30 minutes before our raid start time we have 20ish people online. 30 mins
after a raid, we are 30 or less online too.  People play to raid, not to
grind AA's, farm, quest or Ldon to the death.. and I think thats definately
a growing trend in playstyle now.

Thats not a new trend for us, its always been that way.  Were not the top
guild in EQ, hell were not even close. Numbers are recalled from memory so
some may be a bit off, but we were something like 17th to beat Uqua, 4th to
beat Inktu'ta, 10th to kill Zun, 8th to enter Anguish.  We are up there,
never contesting the top spots, but never far behind. We have an average
guild attendence of like 55%, a memberbase of 85-90, and a regular raiding
crew of 48-52.

Friends I talk to, be it tells or serverwide channels, generally have the
same experiences, numbers and actives as us (member bases around 100, 50
people at any 1 raid).. and thats people in my "elitest" monk channel with
the "insane" requirements  to join... so were talking pure endgame guilds
here too.
