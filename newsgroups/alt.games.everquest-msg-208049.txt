In past NBG threads I always took the position that those who
advocate NBG in pickup groups are (almost) always being quite
greedy, the sorts who only go where the loot they're after
will drop and expect others to help them without incurring any
obligation to do the same in turn.  My recent experience on
Stromm has showed me an alternative use for NBG, although I am
not sure if it would apply very well on the older servers.

My guild has been using NBG pickup groups in zones where usable
loot drops as a PR/recruiting tool.  There is a fair amount of
flux in the membership, and even existence, of the "not quite
ready for prime-time" guilds on Stromm.  Some guilds have melted
down, others have merged, others have merged then evaporated,
and some, like the one I'm in, have been growing even though we
lose an occasional member to another guild or to abandoning the
server.  In an environment like this making friends among those
who are unguilded or disatisfied with their guilds or in guilds
that have questionable prospects is crucial to our survival and
success.  So we'll put together (or join) pickup groups with 2
to 4 of our members in them and head out to camps where stuff
drops for the "outsiders" we're grouped with.  When the whole
plan is to make other people happy the greed issue never comes
into play.  And some of the folks we befriend in this fashion
end up joining us (we're somewhat selective, based on mostly on
attitude as skills can be taught/learned).  As a side benefit
we're usually hunting in full or ear full groups, getting good
xp along with the occasional shot at an upgrade.

Hrmm.  I guess the point of this rambling was just to note how
changing the reason for being in pickup groups changes the way
NBG looks.  If you're in the group mostly because you're looking
to befriend other players, rather than mostly trying to improve
your character, then the loot awards become just another tool to
use in making a favorable impression.  If you're cooperating to
achieve goals routinely, and the guild is expressly committed to
upgrading members gear as a way to make the guild stronger, then
an occasional XP group drop just isn't a big deal.  So where I
used to say that NBG only made sense in groups of friends and/or
guildmates, I am now using it as a tool to help make friends and
recruit guildmates.
