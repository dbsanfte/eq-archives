I agree with ya, man.

There's all kinds of threads on message boards stating that high level
players are so mean, they won't help me, blah blah blah.

Apparently, they aren't telling the whole story.  I've had over a dozen
lowbie characters on various servers, and every single higher level
character I've asked a question to, asked for help and whatnot has been very
polite.  Many of them even went out of their way to come to where I was at
to help me finish these quests.

For example, last night, I started a DE cleric, and needed a black mamba
skin for my armor quest.  I asked if he had an extra one for sale, and he
said no, but he would help me kill black mambas until we get one.  Well,
four hours later, we finally got the skin.  He asked for no compensation
whatsoever, and any offers I did make were refused.

I think most of these people who complain about high levels being so mean
are probably demanding to see what armor they are wearing, demanding to drop
their group to come sow 4 zones away, etc.

High level characters rock.
