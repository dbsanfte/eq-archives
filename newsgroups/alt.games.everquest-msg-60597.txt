If you are going to use memblur/atone in a group, you better let the
taunters know.  Nothing as annoying than working hard to generate
aggro to have someone wipe clear the entire aggro list because they
got tapped a couple of time when they sat down after chain healing
someone.

Or just trust your tanks.
Healing is aggro, but tanks (well good ones anyways) can usually taunt
off the mob within a couple of swings.  Add stuns (even resisted) and
root (again even resisted), it just makes the job harder to taunt
things off.

The same thing with enchanters.  I've seen too many enchanters who get
aggroed (you stacked Tash, Mez, and Slow and wonder why it's pissed
with you?) and *AFTER* I've gotten the mob taunted off (after one or
two swipes at them), they would fire off their AoE stun to piss it off
again.
