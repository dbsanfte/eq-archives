They didn't suggest it was too slow, they suggested it was too hard... and
after -one- mob, and a mob we beat despite poor preperation (enchanter didn't
have mez memmed at all, neither chanter nor I were prepared to deuff resists).
I can't for the life of me imagine giving up at that point, instead of trying a
few more and refining tactics, -then- examining the risk vs reward

My experience prior to the patch was the reverse of this, exp per kill in POP
was so good that going anywhere else was like driving your car in third gear
instead of fourth (or for POV, Fifth).  My bard wasn't able to get POP groups
much prior to 52, but when he did the exp flew.  Once he started being able to
solo in POD, there was really no reason to go anywhere else, I tried to find
something comperable outside the planes but never had any luck.  My cleric,
similarly, found exp anywhere outside the planes downright laughable, and the
wall hit when tier one no longer yeilded exp unless in a group at one of the
contested camps was a tough one; there was nowhere else to go, not when doing
any other kind of mob meant a tenth the exp per hour.

Yes, thats so, but previously the exp/kill was so high that it could compensate
for a low kills per hour.  And depending on the group and the mob, even a high
exp per kill can't do that forever, its quite possible that our group would
still have been better off elsewhere.  What I'm looking at, though, is that
even with a 5 and 6 man group (which is supposed to be a much better exp deal
than it used to) exp for killing a yellow to me mob (meaning it was white or
-barely- dark blue to the high man in the group) got about the same exp as
soloing a cyan mob in COM.  If it had been the same exp as getting a dark blue,
then we could look at the mobs per hour, decide that it was too low, and move
on...

This does work with my experience, but I don't think POJ was any better than
Chardok or Seb or anywhere else you are pulling dark blue mobs in quantity.
Once upon a time I'd have expected twice the exp per hour here as outside the
planes, now, if there was any boost I wasn't noticing it.

Yes, they made noises in that direction, but if you think about it, thats not
really the effect.

Increase exp for groups and decrease it overall, everywhere, to compensate, and
yes, you'd encourage grouping.

But increase it for groups and decrease it -only in POP- and you shouldn't
connect the two events.

Grouping is better than it was before, soloing is no worse than it was before,
thats the effect of the group change.

Exp in planes is worse than it was before, both for soloing and for groups.

Doing both at once hides the degree to which its worse for groups, thats all.

The question I have is how much did they really nerf it (doing the math means
that to do what they said it would have to have been a 20% reduction or less),
and is it now A) still better than the rest of the game.  B) Now about the same
as high ZEM zones elsewhere.  C) Now about the same as average zones
elsewhere.  D) Actually worse than average

Part of whats masking all this information is that the average level of mobs in
POP tends to be higher, and they've monkied with the exp we get off tackling
mobs that are close to or above our own level, so that killing mobs 10 levels
lower than you in HS won't be as good as killing mobs your own level in PON...
at least in theory.  I'm hoping that we can come to some consensus here as to
the relative feel of various zones compared to before the patch.

I personally feel that the nerf of POD might have been as high as 50%; in my
experience the exp per kill here at low 50s was nothing short of astonishing
pre patch, and now is nothing short of ho hum.  And that may well have been the
intent; stop us all from crowding in to the POP zones like they were the only
ones in the game, breathe new life into all the old world zones that have
become deserted.  Increasing group exp, decreasing POP exp, would mean that
full groups working old world dungeons would now be the way to go, instead of
soloing in POP like my bard did most of 52-57.
