Yup, I've gotten that one as well.

I haven't encountered any polls after that one.

Possible, but the xp grind is very boring. I may vote by cancelling
my acount. There are times when the Commons seems to have about 2
monsters, and no corpses about to show a sudeen jump in players. The
respawn on Stromm needs to be faster so new characters can get
somewhere.

As pointed out somewhere in here, those of us with 5 hours a week to
game, grouping doesn't work for me. Which is where I am. I've been
asked to group twice, and both times I was about to log out, and I'm
on vacation. Normally I wouldn't have as many hours as I've gamed
the past week available for gaming. Probably about 15 hours total.
