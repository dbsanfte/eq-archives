Believe it or not, as a monk I can't port either.  I don't even have gate.

Why is that so difficult?  "Thanks for the port, guild_druid01, can i have a
sow and invis now?"   I don't even have to ask my guild porters, its just
considered the norm I guess

It was 1 of 3 choices.. the other 2 are perfectly legit

Im assuming your of a high enough level to have nice buffs, ac and hp.. SG
is trivial.  If your really weary, cast a celestial elix before you start
your run and don't stop.  The only tough mobs, the seahorses (hits for
170's) and they can't even get out the water.

You also have DA and DB.. thats a *lot* of invulnerability time to get
across SG and also probably WW.

Well maybe were 'wannabe ubers' too, by racing for each pop of ST.

The way I see it, we made a commitment to ST, we pharmed first broods, we
made a nice pile of keys, so now we pharm the zone virtually every pop...
help those people get primals that helped me get my ST key etc..

we can beat any guild on our server to ST a lot of the time (prexus has a
huge amount of big guilds, we need a freakin server split already)  so it
makes sense to equip our whole guild, and then be done totally with the zone

ST raids happen early at morning (8am est) when theres no other viable
raiding zone... and for our efforts, we have 45+ primals (not including
people with multiple primals), and the most scales on the server (we have
6.. not even sure any other guild has 1)

And then us 'wannabe uber guild' go clear nToV or whatever else happens to
be up at the time
