I've easily passed the trials (as in, first attempt , repeated times) using
the following group

cleric (bot)
shaman (bot-me)
monk - me
monk
monk
person to be flagged

Guess the lack of rogues didn't hurt me much..

Im not saying rogues are inferior DPS wise to any melee class.. but to list
them as a requirement or necessity is 100% incorrect, imo.

Ps last time guildies had to do a trial, they used
enchanter
wizard
wizard
wizard
cleric
paladin

And passed first time.
