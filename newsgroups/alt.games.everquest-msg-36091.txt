Everytime I try to zone... I get the "Loading please wait" message  and then
the screen goes blank and I end up getting booted back to the server screen.
I have to sign on again ( after waiting a while because my charector is
still active). This is a major pain in the azz!!!
 Has anybody else have this problem? Is there a fix?

        Thanks,
            DMc
