Ta da.  DoD.  To equip, there are no points, you just go do all of them to
get the one or at most two pieces you can get from each.  Each person in the
group that finishes a mission gets a piece of class/archetype-specific loot
on the cursor when finished, as well as sometimes a chest drop at the end
and the random rare drops.  It's a good system, though I could see it
leading to a lot of carbon copies.  The "easy" rewards are Time level, the
"hard" rewards (and those hard missions can be pretty tough) are as good as
a lot of raid drops in GoD and even some later content.  Importantly, there
are some clickies and focus effects in the mix.

There are also quests that use entire sets of these missions for other
rewards (discs, spells, better toys), which was a nice touch.

You can mindlessly grind the same mission over and over with DoD (many do,
particularly with the monster missions), but you find a lot more people out
doing the other sets as well.  Granted, these are mostly raiders, but I
don't think it's a matter of gear but rather knowledge (I almost said
intelligence...  which would be correct, but get me yelled at   =).  The
raiders have a "need" to get those spells/discs (and even some of the
equipment), and the knowledge to know where to get it, or that it even
exists.
