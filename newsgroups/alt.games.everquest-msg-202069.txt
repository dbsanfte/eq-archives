As other people said, its 65 but the Alternate Advancement points
basically make it pretty unlimited. Some really hardcore people might
be 65 and have every AA ability under the sun but most won't.

So in a way "level" is sort of unlimited in EQ now. Even after you get
65 you'll still be trying to get tons of XP, this time for alternate
advancement.
