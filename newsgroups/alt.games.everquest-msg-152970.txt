Oops...forgot to mention that part.  I believe I remember reading that the
limit was "/pause 100", or a 10 second time since you don't really need more
than that in EQ.  That would give 40 second pause before task (4 lines then
task).

I was thinking along the lines of a gutter type of layout, with the
beginning of it on top of the key, that way the ball falls onto the key,
hits it, then rolls off of the keyboard.

Setting the VCR software ins't a problem.  It does automatically start with
Windows also.  The problem is consider the strain in the following
situation.
AMD 1.2GHz Thunderbird processor.
512 MB PC100 RAM
Win98SE
ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon 7500, 4x AGP, 64MB RAM
Sound Blaster Live! Value (PCI)

    Run EQ as a merchant in the Bazaar (we already know how this can be on
your system).  Have ALL graphics settings set to maximum (character models &
all), which normally isn't a problem with exception of slightly choppy
framerate in certain Luclin zones (Kunark has no problem).  Running EQ at
800x600 resolution, 32-bit color.  Also using software to run DirectX 8.1
with a Window in normal Windows mode (rather than DirectX mode like games
normally run).
    AND AT THE SAME TIME!!!...
    Capture 640x480 resolution, 6 Mega-bit per second (about 2.6-2.8 GB per
hour), 30 frame per second, MPEG2 video with 44,100 Hz 16 bit Stereo (CD
quality) audio, capturing from a cable tuner.


THAT is why I need EQ to shut down if left running.  I really doubt ANY
video card (now or anywhere in near future, at least not til the 512MB-1GB,
1GHz DDR video memory, 32x AGP, 2+ GHz CPU, type of card comes out) can
handle that, or even think about doing it for more than a few mili-seconds,
and that is assuming that both EQ & the TV software aren't using the same
resources & wouldn't BOTH crash & fail to run if tried to run at the same
time (more likely what would happen).

Though thanks for the other suggestions as well.
