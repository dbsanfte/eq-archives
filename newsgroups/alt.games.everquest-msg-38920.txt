I generally prefer the subtitled versions of movies, because, in the cases
that I have seen both, I have enjoyed the subtitled one better.  The one
that comes to mind immediately is Das Boot.  If an excellent job of dubbing
is done, then it can work, but most movies that I have seen, there is a lot
lost in the dubbing.  I don't generally have any trouble reading the
subtitles and following the movie, but then, I'm a fast reader.  And, I
loved Yojimbo, have it on laserdisc as a matter of fact.
