I have a 61 DE shadowknight that i enjoy alot, nowadays the SKs are very
good soloers (darkness/fear combo) and  a very welcome addition to groups
since we are the best class (equal to paladins) to gain and hold aggro and
to handle spikeaggro quickly. If i was to make a sk today i was probably
going to go for the ogre, the most deaths i have suffered is from being
stunned so bad that the FD didnt go off...better to back up to a wall and
just hit the FD button as an ogre..never fail.
