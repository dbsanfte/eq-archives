Test server was able to operate with virtually no difference from prod
servers with about a fifth the population. It actually worked better
in many ways, the competition for mobs was so much less.

I wouldn't be surprised if Tallon and Vallon Zek get merged, or maybe
Sullon Zek with one or both of them. They could be merged tomorrow for
that matter. But no regular server will be merged for quite a long
time. 2006 at the earliest.
