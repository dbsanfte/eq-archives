Coldain has more mana once you consider how much each point of wisdom is
worth, however they do have slightly less AC (not really an issue in most
cases though)

I think the main reason is that there are a LOT more of the Eboots, they've
been out since day one (well, whenever people started killing the Efreet)
and were the ultimate in footwear for all the priests and pure casters
before Kunark, and for the most part afterwards.  Whereas once Velious came
out, there were many people with Eboots, and more coming in since they still
drop, while Coldain boots, while (ultimately) a minor improvement, had to
start flooding the market from scratch.

Also, Eboots are some of the few things that Druids can wear with a plate
graphic, which sure as hell better account for why I see so many 45+ druids
in BCPs, I'll take my SoN thanks.

Interestingly though, I got a pair of Eboots at level 30 or so for 2k, when
the average price at that time was 3k-3500, eventually I was able to sell
them for max value, buy coldain cheap, and repeat the trade a few times,
sometimes I'd have Coldain skin (currently wearing and definitely not
selling anymore, I can get money easier without sacrificing equipment),
sometimes I'd have Eboots, and if I was between boots, I still have a pair
of cultural tailored 2 wis boots for backup.

Honestly though, I'm really in the market now for some boots with nice
wis/mana and some SAVES and maybe AC on them, with normal hunting gear I'm
around 80 fire/cold and 60 magic, with save gear that's 103 fire/cold and 63
magic (need to buy a 14 MR ring for resists over my 7 wis ring) and AC
around 750 self buffed (no matter what gear), 800 raid buffed, and this is
as a druid (with no Crystal Chitin/elysian/planar/velious quest armor),
although I'm currently about halfway through the Rough Silver Chain quest,
which will be a nice upgrade for my resist set from my Serpent insignia
collar (5 all resists)

Hmm... enough rambling for you?   I really have a bad habit of rambling a
lot.
