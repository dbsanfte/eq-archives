Few options I'd consider:

Sol A - easy kills, few pp per mob & lots of FS weapons at 5pp ish a
go.  Vendor there too to sell with.  Few named mobs with decent drops
too for the bazaar.

FM - not sure about this at 42, someone will correct me on it im sure!
 Giant Fort has lots of fast spawning mobs with for the most part few
hp (1200ish) - I cant even get it clear they pop that fast!  Regular
loot sucks odd pp, words runes etc but the other drops are worth it. 
Lore weapons are c45pp each, non lore 20ish, Cap & belt 12ish, tunic
60, earring 285pp.  Typically I can do 500pp in 30 mins or so when
I've nothing better to do.

Rathe - you already know about this - trouble is its always heavily
camped.

LDoN - not done a 40s adventure but drops on 65s make around 1200 per
run (200ish each after split).  Lots of tradeskill items drop there
that go for a bomb in the bazaar: Words, Runes & likes of Dew Clover.
