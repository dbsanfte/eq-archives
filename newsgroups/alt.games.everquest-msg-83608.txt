My paladin tends to have a serious case of wanderlust, so I don't think my
bard would be any better.

Well... maybe Erolisi won't be too much of a problem, then.  Of course,
since Neriak is the city of Innoruk....

I'll probably just stick with what I've got now, then.  Hopefully the mask
of deception will help, maybe it won't.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
