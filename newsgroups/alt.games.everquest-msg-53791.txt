I already said PvP is a special case but you still can not tell any thing by
inspection. He can slip on gear after the fight starts and inspection will
not tell you if that player is buffed to the gills. Inspection while
equipment shopping by wearing it is not going to tell the person any thing
about that gear. Putting it on so the player can see the graphic is fine but
no inspection is needed. Telling the stats or showing in a trade window is
still the only thing needed.
