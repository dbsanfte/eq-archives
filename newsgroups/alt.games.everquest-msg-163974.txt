Um, no. something dies, pull the next one.  Takes an extra 15-30 seconds
under most exp group circumstances compared to having one mezzed or
offtanked.

AH, but with my group, our PETS put out such insane DPS (my wolf parses
around 200-230 dps) that we aren't limited by anything but spawns.  I can
make an aa point (at 60) in about 4 hours there, SOLO, ON MOSTLY LIGHT BLUE
giants, with the enchanter, yeah, it slows a bit down, but we can keep the
arena clear, sooo...

And the loot is good anyways.

Except that the warrior CANT be aggressive 100% of the time, thus the monks
outdamage them when they're not under aggressive. (allowing your assumption
that they're not outdamaging them when they ARE under aggressive)
