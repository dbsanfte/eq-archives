Get yourself over to either Warslilks Woods, where at 30 you should be
able to solo the Forest Greenwood giants (there are Forest Evergreens
but not sure they drop off those) there that drop Forest Loops
(earrings) which have +3 Wis and other stats, although as a druid
might be tough as kiting space there not the best, but doable. If you
want a group at 30 then go to Frontier Mountains and head to the Giant
Fort and kill Giant Hillocks (27+), Tumps(30+), Craig(33+) and
Braes(33+) -- these are estimates on levels. These also drop Forest
Loops but you would then need to roll for it.
