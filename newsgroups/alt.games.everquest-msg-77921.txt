Loves this part in particular. :-)
***************************************
GS: Considering the huge amounts of time many people spend playing
online games, what's your idea of a healthy balance between games and
real life? How much time do you spend playing online games? 

BM: With some additional free time lately, I've been playing EQ about 4
to 5 hours a night, most evenings of the week. But this will undoubtedly
decrease again once we're further along with the company and the
project. 

I think that like any other compelling form of entertainment people need
to be careful and use moderation. Playing the heck out of a computer or
video game, or watching TV all day, or just about anything else in
excess will usually lead to all sorts of problems. Not only will you
become burnt out with something you truly enjoy, but also other aspects
of your life might be harmed--jobs, relationships, etc. So take it easy
and keep in mind both moderation and variety.

Sheesh, Brad. Did ya get that one out with a straight face, or was this
over the phone so they couldn't see you smirking?
;-)
Hey, look! Brad just said "EverQuest" and "moderation" in the same
sentence! MUA HA HA.
