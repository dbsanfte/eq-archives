For reference Im a level 52 ranger ;)


Honestly, if I were doing it as a business transaction - say it was
in a zone all greens and the person wasnt a friend or a friend of
 a friend - I'd charge by time increments. Im not going to charge
100pp for a track thats already up, but equally I'm not staying
around for 2 hours endlessly hitting track for 100pp either ;)

The values may change but the principle should be the same at any
level , I guess.

For a friend, or someone entertaining, or a group I would do it for
free ; if I was bored I might do it for free too but I dont think
thats what you're asking ;)
