I wouldn't worry, I can't think of anything they've done recently that had
very much to do with the "Vision."

Verant still decides what to add, and if it doesn't affect balance or
playability but only enjoyability such as added bind points & NPC binders
they might consider it.  If something is finally deemed broken (like
player-only bind) they'll eventually fix it.

Verant has never shown lack of balls.
