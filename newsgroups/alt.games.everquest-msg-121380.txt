Wrong. 

How can you possibly assert that people suffering from mental illness
are incapable of making an "informed choice". Millions of people live
daily with mental illness, and still manage to conduct reasonably
normal lives. They take responsibilty for their actions, and they are
fully capable of making "informed choices". There are many levels and
degrees of mental illness.

In the situation resulting in this discussion, the man/boy who
committed suicide was able to find work, earn a paycheck, and live on
his own in the time leading up to his death. Those facts alone
indicate that given the proper care and attention he most likely would
not have taken his own life.

Where were the 1 year olds parents, and why was a light fixture left
within reach, plugged in, and without a bulb inserted? I would feel
pity that such a young life was wasted, and I would hope that the
parents (or caretakers) responsible for the child were held criminally
accountable. I would not feel compassion or empathy for thier loss,
since it could have (and should have) been prevented.

Neither (the man/boy, or the hypothetical child) should have been left
to their own devices. The infant being completely ignorant, and the
man.boy with a history of problems spanning years.

You seem to have a low opinion of mentally ill people. You do not have
to be "healthy" to understand the difference between right and wrong
(eg understand consequences) or exercise self-control (form intent and
deny compulsion).
