When I am kiting, only singles mind you, I use one of the alternate
viewpoints, usually the one from the greatest distance from me.  It allows
me to keep an eye on my mob.  I have to swivel the viewpoint around at times
just to see where I am going too.  The deal is that if you are going to quad
in a crowded area, like DL normally is, then you have to take extra care
with your mobs.
