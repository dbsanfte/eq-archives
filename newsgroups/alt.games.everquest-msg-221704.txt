Yeah, you're right, but that's not exactly the same scenario I
described.

I don't think it is ridiculous at all. Different people find fun in
different things. Contract negotiation, haggling in the marketplace,
etc. are some of the many types of games people play. Think Monopoly,
Railroad Tycoon, etc.

There is nothing wrong with people who pursue and/or create this
aspect of Everquest for themselves. It is their choice to do so, and
your choice to refuse their terms. Speaking of them in a negative way
on a newsgroup when noone was harmed IS rediculous.

Remember that the cleric was not forcing her position on anyone. It
was not extortion. It was a case of no harm no foul. At the very worst
the result of the cleric's proposal was the same as if the cleric had
said "no thanks" to the group invitation.

Aren't these exactly the questions you ask yourself when pricing items
you want to sell or auction? Is that ridiculous? I don't think so.

If you are that business-minded (some are) and choose to play the game
that way, you are free to, and that's the way it should be.
