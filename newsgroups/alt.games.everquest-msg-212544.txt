Gather Mana is wonderful (zero to FM in 3 seconds...every 2:30 real-world
hours) but requires Mental Clarity 3.  If you're shooting for Gather Mana,
work on MC3 (takes 2, then 4, then 6 points) first, for your Archtypes.

MGB is an obvious serious time saver.  I'd go for this (in fact, I did :p )
before Gather Mana but both abilities are WONDERFUL.

Combat Agility (arch) will get you hit less often, thereby giving you a
better chance of getting a spell cast...and also a better chance of not
dying. :p  There are actually a number of Arch that are really nice for
enchanters, I'm just telling you which way I went.

For fun I spent points in Permanent Illusion.  It's actually damned handy as
well, but I really did it 'cause it's cool.  And, good thing I did, because
Project Illusion requires that.
