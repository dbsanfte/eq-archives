Just based on annecdotal evidence, the bleeding stopped a few weeks
after CoH came out. All the raiders pissed off by GoD where long gone
by then and the casual players that were looking for something new
switched to CoH.

More troubling from Sony's perspective is that the majority won't be
coming back this time because GoD just pissed off too many people. The
raiders where pissed because they got tired of broken content and
casual players where pissed because GoD made it pretty clear that if
you weren't a raider, there wasn't much future for them in EQ.
