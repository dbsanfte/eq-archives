Well, yesterday I went and installed DirectX 8.0a, then installed the latest
Geforce2 drivers, and reinstalled my sound drivers.  After that, everytime I
zone, EQ just locks up.  Network activity is occurring, task manager shows
Entering World is running, but I never zone in.  Oh well, I needed to
reinstall Win2k anyway.  Formatted, installed Win2k with DirectX7,
reinstalled all drivers, everything is back to working.  I don't know if the
problem was with the Geforce2 drivers, or with the new DirectX.  Going to
try the new drivers tonight, maybe.  The reason I decided to try this was
that every once in a while, EQ freezes for a few seconds.  It's not frequent
enough that it has caused me any problems, but it's quite annoying.  I am
using a Geforce2 MX400 card with 64mb, PIII-800, and built in sound support
using some VIA chipset.  Anyone else out there have experience with these
kind of problems that has managed to resolve them?  Any recommendations
would be appreciated.  One more thing, I checked the resources of the
various devices, and the network card, the sound, and the video card are all
sharing IRQ 11, I vaguely recall that that could be a source of problems.
