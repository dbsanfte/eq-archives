  I know many people never have it, and so therefore it is in some way
related to configuration.  I only play two characters on Terris-Thule, a
mage and a druid.  It never happened with the mage up to level 24 where he
is now.  All incidents have been with the druid, now level 29; one 4 months
ago, one two months ago, and now 6 or 7 within the last 3 days.  Very
odd, could it be patch-related??

  It's the dramatic rise that has me concerned.  If there is something
I can do to prevent it, changing configurations or whatever, I will
gladly do that without Verant fixing anything (although I do believe
they should fix it, I'm not on a campaign for "principle" or anything)

  I am not the only one.  Last night I did a /shout in LOIO (while
in midair) and received over 6 players (out of 40-50 in zone) that
stated they had similar things happen to them.  I asked configuration
questions to those that would talk to me, and I can't see a common
denominator, different processors, different video cards, different
connections.

  The advice from most was to forget this and just talk a GM into an
exp res when it happens.  The attitude is the bug will never be fixed.
That may be, but let's see.
