Groups I am familar with enjoy the crowd control, and when kei goes down (if
the group is together that long) it is nice to get C2.

There was that problem before kei.  I don't see a change or worsening on
that problem.  Obviously you would think it would be worsened, but in

What kei has done is help to fix the biggest complaint that eq has had since
the beta days.  That is downtime.  Sitting on your butt medding before the
next pull was the number one complaint in eq and kei reduced it.
