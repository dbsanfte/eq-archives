There's your flaw. You're expecting it to mirror reality closely. I
note you have no complaint about the lack of character aging, lack of
lavatories, and so on. Or the way that you can sit there and practice
making a single item in many trades (Fish rolls in baking, for
example), and automaticly become better at everything else that's
easier to make even if it's a totally different product. (I've been
making fish rolls for days, now I can marinate and grill a perfect
steak even though I've never touched one before in my life!)

Yes, the system is imperfect. There are many reasons for straying from
a "perfect" mirroring of reality: technical limitations, game balance,
etc. Fail rates are a balance, as well as the trivial levels. Someone
said "reliable" combines don't come until at least 50 points over
trivial. Imagine how cheap and easy smithing practice would be if
metal bits didn't trivial until the fail rates were reliable - say,
70. On the other hand, think how cheap and easy it would be if fail
rates were that low as soon as it became trivial. The cost is
INTENTIONAL.
