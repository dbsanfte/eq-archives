Because the default jobs are what I told you.  Kill stuff, do your job.
Leave the saving of players to the people who are supposed to.

If in your regular group you say, "oh, now the enchanter's going to be MT,
ranger's going to be CC, warrior's gonna do nothing but look around for
adds, paladin's gonna pull, cleric's gonna nuke, and the necro's going to be
healer," that's fine & dandy...do it how ever you want.  But in pickup
groups or ANY time you hunt with strangers, do it the way EVERYONE should
know, or communicate how this group will be doing it.

Had the tank NOT changed targets it's quite possible that NO ONE would have
died.  Yes, a good enchanter adapts to bone-headed tanks that don't know
their roles in pickup groups, and it's obvious you had a mediocre one at
best.

But quite frankly, your class SUCKS when it comes to saving players, when
you compare it to the abilities of enchanters or bards, just like shaman
SUCK when it comes to melee, compared to your class.
