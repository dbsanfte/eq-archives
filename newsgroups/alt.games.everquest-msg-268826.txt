That reasoning is flawed then. If you want to show the association off
you're not really working for the guild are you? You're working for the
personal satisfaction of knowing that other people know you're in that
guild. I'm in a guild and while it's encouraged to do writs it's not an
absolute must. I still have pride in my guildmates, but I don't see the
need to show off to everyone else. JMO

Question: If you could live forever, would you and why? Answer: I would not
live forever, because we should not live forever, because if we were
supposed to live forever, then we would live forever, but we cannot live
forever, which is why I would not live forever.
