I usually do the b) thing. But this time I could not do that :) There was
this level 56 or so druid in Misty that was offering 100pp for a stack!
Hell, I need money. I gated to WC, ran to the inn from  EC, bought 1 stack
and gated back to Misty. Voila 100pp :) I know, I was mean, but come on ...
you would think a level 54 would know that you can acutally buy a stack of
bat wings for 2gp or so.
