Most likely it was the social aspects of the game.  Here are some
differences between the two games that affect socializing.  By
"socializing" I mean both interaction with random people, *and*
developing a set of regular online friends to play with.

1. DAoC does not have long range broadcasts outside of the main city
of each realm.

2. DAoC doesn't require nearly as much continuous playtime as EQ to
accomplish things.  My EQ time overlapped with that of my friends
because it is almost not possible to NOT overlap in EQ. :-)

3. EQ players in many zones tend to crowd into a few areas.  If you
have any Wizard or Druid friends in real life who run ShowEQ, go watch
and have them take a tour of the world, and look at the distribution
of players in each zone.  Take a zone like Frontier Mountains.  There,
you'll find that most players are in one of the following areas: near
LoIO zone, near the giant fort, near OT zone, and perhaps a group
working the rare spawn cycle.  Then note where the mobs are: the
*entire* zone is full of mobs that all of those people (except the
ones working the rares) could hunt.

In DAoC, the players spread out more.  Even though if you were to
compute the players/area ratio for the two games, DAoC would come out
as more crowded (approximately the same number of people per server as
EQ, crowded into a smaller world), you run into fewer people in DAoC.

4. DAoC has less camps.  In EQ, you decide you want a group, you go to
one of the many camps, and wait...someone in a group there will
eventually leave, and you'll get a spot.  Meanwhile, you are
participating in zone chat while waiting, goofing off with the other
people waiting at the zone line, etc..  Groups in EQ at many camps
become entities in their own right, independent of the players who are
just cells in the body of the group.  In DAoC, rather than one person
leaving but the group staying, it is more likely that the whole group
will leave.

5. Soloing in general works a lot better in DAoC than in EQ, so there
is less incentive to form groups.

6. EQ is older.  DAoC's social structure is still forming.  When most
of the DAoC population is in guilds and doing RvR, things might be
different.
