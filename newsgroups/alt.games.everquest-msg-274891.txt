That is crazy, not sure what is going on then.  When we are in PF, it
takes one, maybe two kills before the .5% vitality that you get per
hour is used up.    Last night I had about 14% vitality when I logged
in (adventuring).  Less than an hour later, it was dry - but that
includes one quest completion and progress on a book quest (not sure if
each page gives an xp bonus or not).

One thing that is possible is the xp bars are messed up.  The top and
bottom bar don't agree with each other.  I didn't think that issue
applied to the vitality marker, since it is external to the bars, but I
guess it is a possibility.
