I KNEW someone was going to think of this.
Wonder what model of fantasy physics applies. If it's anything like real
physics, that breath can't be steam: it's freezing outside, it's even more
freezing in the body of the mob, so...the water won't make it out of the
body to begin with, it's frozen in place.

  Hmmm. Is it even water? Maybe they are made of many different ices...
possibly it's ammonia or something with a lower boiling point than water.
Aren't you glad you can't SMELL the environment in Norrath?
Of course you are. You have been ever since spawning in Qeynos without
getting overwhelmed by the stench of solid biological waste, produced by 
humans
and animals of many species.
