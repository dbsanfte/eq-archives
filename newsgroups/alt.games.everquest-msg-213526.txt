Holly is far less picky than that.  It's entirely sufficient for her
twisted purpose to have the animal hurt (or even attempt to hurt) you.
She really doesn't give a shit if you hurt the animals or not, she's
just looking for an excuse slice and dice player characters.  Frankly,
I suspect she's jealous of the DEs (Kizdean Gix, Dorn B'Dinn, et al)
who rarely trouble themseles to find an excuse for a homicidal rampage.
