I would agree with you normally.... however :)

These cards worked FINE before the new DirectX engine.  I had a Rage Fury Pro
(as did my cousin) and both of us upgraded because of the problems.

The cards work fine for every other game, why not EQ?  They used to.

Aside from that, the cards were on the supported list until Verant saw the
amount of people having problems, then, someone ordered the removal of them
from the website.

Not all of this is driver issues, nor is all of this EQ issues, it's somewhere
in between.  That's what makes it so frustrating.
