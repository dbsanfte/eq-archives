One good thing...it's more convenient to use the Luclin teleports than the
boats.
With the boats, you wait and wait, never really knowing when the boat will
show.  Then you just sit there for the next thirty minutes while the boat
sails.
With Luclin, there is a zone-wide broadcast that tells you when the port
will activate.  Then you can hunt or whatever until it's time to go.

That alone is worth it to me.
