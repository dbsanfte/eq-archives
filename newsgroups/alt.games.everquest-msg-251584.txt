There must be some remark about "nuts and bolts" that belongs here. :)

I only recently started a Wizard, and saw that some of my spells were
deprecated because they required LOS.  So like you, I tended to use
them only in specific situations.  But I too grew curious about never
seeing them miss.  So one time when I was grouped in the lobby of
Kurns, and the healer was medding, I poked forward into the big hall,
targetted a mob off to one side, then backed up into the lobby and
cast a bolt.  My intent was to see what the message said when LOS was
blocked, so I'd know what to watch for.  Instead, there was a pause
of a few seconds, and then my targetted mob came around the corner
at me.

Later I tried it again, and this time it took nearly half a minute for
the mob to appear; I think I must've targetted something on the second
floor walkway.  Apparently LOS spells not only don't require an open
LOS, they don't even require that the target be visible!  This means
they're mostly better than other nukes, since bolts generally do more
damage per mana.  (They do also have an additional delay while the bolt
travels to the target.)

I've been told that LOS spells really did used to require LOS, and
that the current behavior is an effect of the DX9 engine.  Probably
it'll get fixed some day, but in the meantime, bolt away!

Judge to defendant: "And what were you, a simple locksmith, doing in
that house of ill repute when the police launched their raid?"

Defendant: "If it please your honor, I was making a bolt for the door."
