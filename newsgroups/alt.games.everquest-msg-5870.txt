Though others report it happening elsewhere, I have to wonder if it isn't
something specific to South Karanas.  The one time I experienced that was with
my wizard. I was running from a Bull elephant who aggro'd on me while I was
soloing an elephant, and I had made it to the bridge while being gored all to
hell by the bull.  I zoned through ok, but landed at the gypsy camp. (Last place
I had bound myself, since I was selling loot there, and could still port back to
the bridge to save time.)
  Weird indeed, but since I didn't lose my stuff or any xp, and apparently
hadn't actually "died", I shrugged it off, healed up, and went back out again.
