Real Money isn't a token in a *video game* though. 

Think about it this way: If you are going to extend legal protection to 
that virtual sword then you have to extend legal protection to that 
virtual plat too. And once that is in place, if someone scams you in 
game... by swapping in a no rent summoned bag for that Evil Eye bag you 
thought you agreed to purchase. Now its not a matter for the GMs to sort 
out... Now the police and courts are involved.

What if SoE nerfs that sword? Can you sue them?

etc etc etc

That is ridiculous. Property crime in the inner world of a *video game* 
should not be subject to the law, and thus property in the inner world 
of a video game should not be protected by those laws.

There is a good reason SoE's EULA states that all the contents of your 
account belongs to them and not you.
