Not why com is bad . Com has plenty of room. It however does have vastly
overpowered caster mobs , magic immune reavers , a lagg problem which is
near unbelievable , and it requires a rogue or cheating with gravity spells
and a magician .  You aggro through walls , ae spells get you in trouble ,
the loot is not split into sections for the lesser mobs ( further in dosent
pay that much better unless you fight the reavers ).
