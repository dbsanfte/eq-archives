Most clerics found that pet useless when it cost 600 mana to cast.
Now that it costs 180 mana (well, 250 mana if you don't have
the incredibly underpriced Enshrouded Veil) to cast, I don't think
you'll see all that many thinking clerics turning up their noses at it.

In fact, when people are discussing the improved cleric damage
output, they are almost certainly including the pet as part of that
output.

Snare undead, I agree, is a sadly lacking spell for both paladins
and clerics, although giving it just to paladins might redress the
balance the cleric upgrade tips over.  Then again, I'd also
like to see the number of zones with undead in them doubled.
