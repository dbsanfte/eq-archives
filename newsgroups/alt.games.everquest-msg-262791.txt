I disagree here.  It's a game.  A passtime. No more, no less.  To make more
than that out of it is to give it life that it simply doesn't deserve.

Anyone who attempts to acquire self esteem by doing something which 99.9% of
the world finds beyond meaningless (like completing their epic) is in pretty
sad shape.  I know people in RL who are like that, though ... and frankly,
they are in pretty sad shape with regards to self esteem.  The concept of
balance has been lost to them.  They remind me of the people who skipped
class and eventually flunked out of college to play D&D, then looked down on
those of us who actually went to class instead of gaming.

It's no different than being around someone who lives to play golf.  Now,
don't get me wrong.  I like to play golf.  But when I'm around someone who's
absolutely eaten up with it ... who can talk of nothing else ... I pity
them.  There's a reason the phrase "Get a life" was coined ... for folks
who've lost their sense of balance.  Everything in moderation.

There are much more fulfilling ways to acquire self esteem.  Offer to help a
cause you believe in.  Lend a hand at your neighborhood elementary school.
Go to the public library and read for the kids on Saturdays.

Or, if you're a soloist (/grin), get on a bike and start training, then ride
a century.  The same size subset of people as play EQ may actually know what
a century is, but the reward one reaps by the accomplishment is far greater
than simply acquiring an item in a game.

You can buy a patch or a plaque that says you've ridden a century, but you
can't buy a century.  You can only earn it. And seeing someone else with a
plaque doesn't cheapen yours one little bit. ;-)
