I mean lag as in high packet loss.  When I first log into the game world,
everything is fine for about 5 minutes, then the latency meter on the upper
left of my screen goes blood red with loss in the 70-80% range.

My frame-rate is fine - movement is smooth, the characters on the screen move
smoothly, etc. (I turned down practically every single bells and whistles the
game allows, even sound.)

While I don't think having more RAM on my system would solve this problem, I
still plan on getting more, considering how cheap it is these days.
