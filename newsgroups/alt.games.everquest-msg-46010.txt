Yes, the some of the spiders do... but I was leading up
to suggesting the Cabalis bind spot, since its safe as houses
if you can invis or rogue hide&sneak.

That spot also happens to be where the firepots out in Timorous
Deep take you, which is how I discovered that it was "safe"... I
bought some invis potions and ported in with my cleric to
see what would happen, fully expecting to end up dead and an
interesting CR.  Well, one thing, using the pots does not break
invis.  But then when I arrived there was nothing there to be
scared of, and I stood around for ten minutes, still nothing,
broke invis to con the guards I could see in the distance (checked
before breaking, they don't see invis, cause I was indif) and
still nothing.

I've literally left my Erudite necro there, fully visible, for an hour
while afk, just -trying- to get dead, nothing.  Only way that those
guards are going to go after you there is if someone trains them
to that spot, and non-iksar are so amazingly rare in Cabalis that
I can't see worrying about it.

They are quite scary, since one of their most frequent casts is
a good solid root.  Used to be worse, back when root broke
your SOW, so even if you could manage to survive till root
broke you'd still end up unable to run to the zone without the
spider (and its add buddies) nibbling at your heels the whole
way.
