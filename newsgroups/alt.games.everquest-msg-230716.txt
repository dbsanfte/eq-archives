I have to admit... I followed this thread for a bit, but found it dull and
contrived.  I admit to being shocked quite a bit by its popularity.  My
personal theory is that the guys really enjoyed a post by a gal who actually
expresses interest in the opposite sex.

The writing is good, don't get me wrong, the author has talent.  Just the
subject material was uninteresting to me.
