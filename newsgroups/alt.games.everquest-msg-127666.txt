Isn't ShowEQ the biggest cheat there is at the moment?  And that isn't
really modifying anything, its just viewing things that weren't meant to be
viewed.  As far as I know you can't really cheat other than ShowEQ simply
because everything important is done on their side.

Though there was that little glitch back in late summer of 2000 (I believe
it was August) where an Asian version of EQ (forgot what country) had allot
of people on the Nameless server developed a memory hack that allowed them
to duplicate stuff.  I believe the duplicating bug was that they had someone
put stuff into the trade window to show it (might have also worked with
inspect) and that person's screen flickered a time or two, then they cancel
the trade, leaving themselves with a copy of everything they saw from the
other person.  I think the outcome was that Verant banned over 100 accounts
by tracing a coded serial # for each item back to the individuals and
learning who was involved (or something like that).

What ever happened with that story?  Anyone else able to confirm or correct
any of this or add to it?  How long did it take to clean up the mess, and
did the eventually remove ALL duplicated items?  Has anything else even
close to this happened since?
