As a software engineer.. you should know by know that SoE *NEEDS* EQ2
to survive. EQ is simply growing old.. products do not last forever
and if you do not innovate you get run over. SoE has now had the
chance to rewrite the entire game from the ground up... without a lot
of the old issues that existed due to legacy code. If they've done
their job well(ya right), we could have a game built to expand..
doesn't have caps of 255 that made sense in the 80's, is setup to be
able to be supported on multiple systems, has a next generation sound
and graphics interface, and raises the bar for other games in the
genre. Simply patching EQ some more won't do that.

To give an analogy.. the mmorpg industry is about where the operating
system industry was in 1995. Windows had been out for 10 years and
over that time a midguided initial program to provide a windowing
interface for PC's was enhanced and enhanced, but still built off old
technology. With Windows 95 Microsoft completely rewrote the system..
brought in a lot more integration and put out a product that was light
years beyond what they had put out before. Did it end up killing
Windows 3.11? Sure... but there isn't anybody who doesn't consider
that a good thing. The nice part about this paradigm shift in mmorpgs
is that you'll have a viable choice to go along with EQ2. Don't like
it? Try Worlds of Warcraft.. see if its up your alley. Or City of
Heroes.. the choices are there.

Either way.. if you can't see that the original EQ will be dead in a
couple years.. whether EQ2 comes out or not as a result to advances in
the technology... you need to learn more about software engineering.
