Horse on and model off does not work - as you can find out painfully
when you have a playfull chanter turn you into a race whose model you
have turned off. You loose your horse, and get the "you have to have
both your current model and elemtal/horse turned on" error.  Too bad
realy, dark elf shaman always cracks me up.
