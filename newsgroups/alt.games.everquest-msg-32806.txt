MT is an excellent zone IMO. Everything from sewing kits to baking supply
vendors right there. I don't know if it is still true, but the goblin
workers there used to drop an inordinate amount of hardware for their level.
No zoning to turn in Deathfist Orc belts, Deputy Budo is right there.

Several low level quests and tie point to several mid level quests. Don't
know if the Queen still spawns in MT, but I actually completed the bug
collection for the bug collection quest w/o ever needing to leave the zone
by killing her there. I have seen several people offering a couple of pp per
honeycomb which drops off of a bixie.

I think I have picked up a +5 mana statue off of Mooto.

If you didn't need to go to your guildmaster for training, you could get all
the way to 15-17 w/o zoning once and have several nice pieces of hardware.
