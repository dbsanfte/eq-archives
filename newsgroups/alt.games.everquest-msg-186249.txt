In DL in particular, I have seen many times where the mob runs away from 
you at top speed when you get far enough away.  It does not just path back 
to where it belongs, it is actively running away.  It has been a long time 
since I have hunted there, but it was quite annoying.  This is behavior 
that I definitely do not see in most zones.
