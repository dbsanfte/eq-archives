I play on Sullon Zek. It is by far the hardest server to play on. No one can
kill you until you are lvl 6+ then the fun starts. You need a very thick
skin and some skills to make it much past lvl 14 here. Only 1 character per
account is allowed here as well as there are no rules.

http://pub101.ezboard.com/bsullonzekatwar is the servers message board.

Things here are very harsh. So is the message board. You have been warned.


BTW  IMHO this is the way everquest should be played
