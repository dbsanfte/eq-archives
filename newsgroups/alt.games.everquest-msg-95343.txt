I would recommend Druid, Monk, Mage, or Necro. Druid because
it would provide Healing, Porting, SoW, Tracking, Snare, and
DoTs that stack with yours. Monk because it's the melee
class that is least dependent on healing (which you don't
have). Mage or Necro because the pet could be your tank.
Although Paladin would seem ideal (big tank with the best
melee healing), after low levels Paladins often don't have
enough damage output to kill mobs without healing support
from priests.
