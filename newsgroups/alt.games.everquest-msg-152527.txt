Yes fix the stinking game.

New content is; harder hitting, under conning MoBs who are immune to
key spells that my class depends on. Here I am a druid, the "king" of
the outdoors and my animal fear, snare, root are made useless because
some of the MoBs in zone are immune. Frankly if a MoB is that
important that you don't want those spells to work; stick it at the
bottom of a dungeon where I can't reach it. It's "Yard Trash", it
doesn't need all that buffing. But I am sure it is all in the name of
"challenge".  All it does for me is make me leave that zone and never
come back. "Yard Trash" isn't worth the risks or effort for a few
plats, if even that.

Jaggedpine left me empty, Stoneburnt was hard to reach for it's
rewards. If those zones are new content, I can live without new
content.
