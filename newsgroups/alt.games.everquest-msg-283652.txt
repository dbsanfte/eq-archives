Indefinitely.

I'm pretty sure you can't open a merchant window while FD, and I'm
quite sure you can't FD after the window is open.  I'm also pretty
sure opening the window breaks Hide, but I'm not sure whether the
faction check happens before or after that, i.e., do you get the
indifferent faction for the purpose of opening the window.  I don't
think it works, but haven't tried it recently.
