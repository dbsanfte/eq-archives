Hand wraps

Three shade bandages, special no drop pattern, combine.

For beast lord quest.

Note that beast lords getting this quest from animist proven are
supplied with
the pattern and a four slot sewing kit.  Failing the 3 bandages and
pattern combine
does not destroy the pattern.

I have never had combine to make Shade Threads fail, but have had
several
combines to make Shade bandages fail, neither operation is trivial yet
at 12 tailoring
skill.  I hvae failed the Hand Wrap combine four times running, now, so
its trivial
level must be -significantly- higher than 12.

Oh, and Shadeling silks drop off Xatra Larvae in the crater around Shar
Val, which
is the 1-5 hunting grounds.  Newbies need some care fighting there, as
lots of
normally non-aggro creatures will add if you are fighting a larvae.

I'm glad to see the hopperhide recipees, as I clearly need to work
harder on
getting tailoring up if I'm going to get this quest done!

There is an NPC somewhere in town who talks about Xatra tailoring, I
wasn't
interested in tailoring overmuch at the time (busy trying to cope with
my
insanely bad lag while exploring)
