Remembering that this is stuck in the realm of opinions, I still must
respetfully disagree. We are all familiar with the people who try to
draw analogies between widely disparate things in this and other
newsgroups.

Examples such as, "Oh, I see. So you're saying it's ok to take seven
pennies out of the 'share a penny' cup at the convenience store rather
than giving the clerk a dime and getting change. And I suppose you think
sodomizing orphaned three year olds is fine to, DON'T YOU!!??!!
PERVERT!"

This, however, does not IMHO fall into that category at all. My example
was two people doing things that were both damaging to the other person
and clearly wrong. However, one was just hugely more damaging, life
threatening, etc. than the other. Yours was the same thing.
Ninjalooting, steamrolling raids, etc. have a much larger effect on more
people, cost items, time, etc. worth a lot more in PP/xp etc. than the
example of some unscrupulous vendor ripping off a poorly funded newbie
in a trade, but they are both plainly wrong and make the perpetrators
shitheels. I think the analogy stands up quite well.

It takes *you*, or *me* nothing more than a bit of patience. Then again,
we've been playing for years and have well over a hundred levels of
experience across our characters and have been around the proverbial
block more than a few times. We know the resources are out there, and if
not, have the contacts to speak with on short notice to ferret them out.
Think back, if you can, to when you had been in the game less than a
month like the OP. Would you have known where to look to find out
accurate price information or relative worth, value, attributes of an
item? Would you have  known anyone reliable to ask? Hell, would you even
have known *what* to ask? I wouldn't have. So no. Trying to pull out a
"caveat emptor" and dump the responsibility on the feet of the OP in our
hypothetical scenario here is a complete copout as I see it.

I've missed some as well. My bad only, not the sellers. But as to "far
slimier", see my burning the house down analogy. There are far slimier,
and downright illegal against the PNP scams being pulled. Doesn't make
this lesser offense any less of a shitheel move, though.

Me either... but it's fun to hash it out sometimes, isn't it? :-)

I dunno. For some reason, it only ever bothered me when Annie did it.
Probably a mental imbalance I really need to look into. Well, and of
course, when you do it, since you point it out specifically to direct at
me. Started out as a simple joke one day with Annie, but has seemingly
evolved over the last year into the defining element of our online
dialogue. Point in case... I didn't even notice Khosh's sig. Of course,
I will now. ;-)

I can loan you some medication for that. Granted, it was prescribed for
one of our horses with a rather different ailment, but hey... it
couldn't hurt to try.

jaZZ <---- Couldn't hurt *me* anyway.
