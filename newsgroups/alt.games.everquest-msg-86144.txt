Yep, I still share my password with the person who has the key to my 
apartment.  I NEVER said anything about sharing with a 15-year old punk.  
I made it very clear that I share the password with someone who has access 
to all my real life stuff.  In case you missed it, the point is that an 
Everquest password is like anything else, share it only with people you 
trust, and don't share it if you can't stand to lose it.  (Yes, I could 
stand to lose my character, a lot easier than I could stand to lose my 
home, or my car, or my bank account.)  Oh, and if the person who has my 
account were to go apeshit crazy and sell my account off, I certainly 
wouldn't come crying about it here.  
(Another sidebar, since I do work in computer security, how the FUCK do 
you suggest I handle supporting 30some firewalls in North America and 
another 60some worldwide without allow other people access to them, in 
some cases, people I've never met personally?  Then once you figure that 
out, work on the dozens of routers and switches and unix and NT boxes and 
all that.  Oh, sure, you're Superman the deep cover CIA operative and 
could do it all yourself, but the real world relys on trust and logging.)
