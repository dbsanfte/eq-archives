> Which character would you say is the best?

Well since you asked what I say is best, I like three characters almost
equally. Rogue, Shaman, & Mage. Shaman & Mage can solo pretty much all the
time (shaman gets easier at 34 because of pet). Rogue is fun you can do lots
of things for a party, and if you have a good tank to hold agro you can add
long term DPS that no other class can.

People will suggest playing what sounds fun and this is the best advice they
can give. Don't try a bunch of characters to level 10, honestly play one (or
maybe two if you have lots of play time) to at least 20 before you try
something else (unless you totally hate the class early on, but remember it
will change)

Solo classes
Mage & Necro (under 20) sick pet cast DOTS & nukes
Necro over 20 fear kiting snare mob, fear mob, sick pet & DOTS
Beastlord (pet at 9) sick pet, DOT, & melee (never played one this is
observation)
Wizard root & nuke, at 29 snare and kite (AOE nuke, run, repeat) more than 1
mob (4 is supposedly optimal)
Druid - root & nuke or DOT, snare and kite more than 1 mob eventually (not
sure when this becomes easiest)
Bard - charm fight mob, break charm kill mob, "swarm kiting" get a crap load
of mobs charm one let the others beat it down, break charm and kill it,
repeat (or something like this)
Enchanter - charm fight mob, break charm kill mob. Use pet if you can get
hit only once, debuf let pet kill it nuke & DOT
Shadowknight - fear kite eventually

Cleric, Warrior, Paladin, Monk, & Rogue - can solo, just not very optimal -
but they are usually wanted in groups anyway (as are the above if groups are
smart) - I probably missed some class in this list, oh well.

Personally my first character back in the beta days was a shaman....
