It's an accepted USENET maxim that those who must resort to personal
attaks are doing so because they are confronted with overwhelming
evidence that their stand and/or position is completely wrong. That
they are, in fact, conceding the debate.

Thank you for your concession...

Actually, since you can't hold an adult debate w/o lapsing into
personal attacks (which, judging from your previous posts, I would
have assumed was beneath you) why don't you just "Plonk" me in
USENET.. It would be in your best interests to do so..
