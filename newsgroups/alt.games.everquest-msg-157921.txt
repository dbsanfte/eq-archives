Just a quick comment here.  I'm not a log parsing ubah player with
multiple level 60+ characters, but in my limited druidic experience,
soloing yellows is not very efficient.  So I'm not sure how truly
valuable it is to be able to solo some yellows a bit longer than
some other classes.  I can get more exp and loot sticking with dark
blues.

But, as I mentioned in another thread, I do find playing a druid
easier than most of the other classes I've tried, except for necro.
