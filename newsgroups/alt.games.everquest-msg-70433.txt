I saw one the first day, plus I heard that a guild cleric, level 52, bought
one of the most expensive ones for 110kp.   I wondered how he could afford
it, then I grouped with him in Seb for the first time.  All the gems &
jewelry went to him except a couple of black sapphires.  He spent (he
claims) 300p on peridots and sold the gems/jewelry for 1300p.

He's a new guild member who hasn't bothered checking the guild board even
once (and we require minimum once/wk and soon at least twice, maybe thrice)
and hasn't checked the charter.  He seems nice enough but something tells me
he may not be voted in as a full member in a few weeks.
