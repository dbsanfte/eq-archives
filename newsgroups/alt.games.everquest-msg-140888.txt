Then you need a better puller.  CT isn't an easy place to pull, far from it,
but with a more cautious puller, getting 1 or 2 inc would have been a
totally different result.

Also, taking care that the mob FOLLOWS you back to base is vital.  if the
mob gets lost for whatever reason (you ran too fast with SoW, or it stopped
to cast and you didn't wait) then it will path through the maze, and you
WILL get wiped

hehe even in full plate, it would take about 2 seconds to kill you.   if the
warrior has AE taunt then good, 7 mobs are hitting him instead of the
casters.. but hes gonna drop like a rock.  Toss a cheal on him, the cleric
is now gonna drop like a rock.

They do so much damage so fast, no matter how well geared the group, get
more than a handful of mobs and your dead before you even get your spell off

So with full buffs (focus, aego, brells, stam) he's going to be in the high
6k region - thats at least 1k more HP than me (probably higher AC too)

How many guilds on your server have killed the AoW/Tunare?  On prexus its 4
and 5, another guild got her to 50%, and an alliance killed her

We have about 8 guilds who kill Dain (not sure if the others could or not..
I guess they don't because of faction)

Your server sounds like a dream come true for guild with big plans but also
big competition on their own server.  Maybe thats where TR will move to if
their deal with VI works :)

250 people in ssra/ntov chasing 1 target just isn't fun for anybody
