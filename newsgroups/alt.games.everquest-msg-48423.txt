I surely wouldn't do this as a full-time soloing technique, but I think it
would be fun to try.  The kiting I -have- done was with my bow in WC.  A
good friend of mine has a fletching over 200 and made me a nice bow in
return for him borrowing all my INT gear that he could wear, so I gave the
bow to my warrior.  The kites usually started out as 1-on-1s, but when a
Derv decides to jump in to help his buddy, or I would grab an add on
accident, I would switch to a different view and start backpeddling, raining
arrows down ( if shooting one ever 5 seconds or so is considered raining =)

I remember watching my first quad-kite at Gargoyle / Spec isle when I was
playing my Necro.  It was awesome to behold, having never seen it before.
The druid took the time to explain to me how it was accomplished and was
nice enough never to bring them near where I was pulling to.

I would also have to sit and watch a warrior "kiting" with a weighted axe
for the pure entertainment value.  Seeing new things is what I am into, and
that, Shirley, would be new.
