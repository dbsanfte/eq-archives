Thanks, we've met. :)

/em looks at his own sloppy, brute-force code for figuring out a tiny 
detail about how nature works running in the other window...

You're saying this isn't a valid comparison?  It's only a matter of scale, 
really.

I fully expect Nature to handle things in a brute force manner.  But it 
frequently ends up being rather elegant.  I'd expect something far better 
than brute force from a deity, though.  Why make proteins out of 20-22 
randomly shuffled elements and allow them to tune themselves through this 
complicated evolutionary process, rather than making a structure that is 
the perfect tool for the job in the first place?
