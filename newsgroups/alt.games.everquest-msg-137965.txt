Scroll down.  DOH.  There it is, the options I'd really wanted to see,

I changed all the dark blue ones as well.  I'll have to play around
and try to come up with a good overall color plan, but the
emergency level mission was to pick any colors at all that could
be seen without straining.

I'm quite irritated that that box can't be resized, I'd really like to see
all the chats and their colors at the same time, but no matter where
I scroll they don't seem to all fit.  I guess its resizable or scroll
but not both?

Any idea as to a rational color scheme would be appreciated
here, I think I made some of the bars the same color as guild
say and so forth, would be better if I could tell at a glance
what kind of message each is by color, which seems to be the
idea.
