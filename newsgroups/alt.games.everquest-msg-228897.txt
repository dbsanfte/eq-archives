Sit on it.

I found a Hill giant that way in Eastern Karana.  I sat down to med.

Next thing I see is a hill giant is attempting to hit me. I know as a 
Halfling most thing seem bigger to me. But I was certain that Hill 
Giants were bigger than me.

But as I slowly spun on the spot (due to stun) Nothing???

Luckily I still had SoW up. So when the stun wore off I legged it. I was 
amazed as Hill Giant lumbered out the hill I was sitting on.

So be careful where you sit to rest. You never know what might be hiding 
under that pebble :)

Yours
