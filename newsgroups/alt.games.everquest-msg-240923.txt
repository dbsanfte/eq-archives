Advantage: People you can group with, that know you.

Dis Advantage: If your guild requires it you may "have" to show up at a
certain number of events.

I play in a guild that is pretty loose about all that stuff, mainly it is a
way for all of us to see who is on and to help get to know the player base.
Also to help each other out.  I mean how often can you /ooc a need for your
char and someone will get it for you jjust because your a "guildy"?
