Before today I'd have said you would be nuts to give up FT2 for any amount
of resist penalty.  Frankly, the difference between 100 save and 250 save
amounted to pretty much nothing at all, I'd given up ever putting on my resist
kit that I'd so lovingly assembled, wis and mana and hp and AC and heck,
charisma were more important than resists, level was pretty much the only
thing that mattered.

Looking at todays patch message, though, it seems like I just might start
caring about resists again after all.
