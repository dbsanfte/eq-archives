And believe me, that is a lot of weight.

My first experience with being seriously overweight was my first trip to
Freeport (with a halfling druid, no less). Rosewhite went to do the orc pawn
pick quest, turning them in four at a time to (mumble) Hallard at Hallard's
Resale in East Freeport (gives great faction with the local merchants and
rogues guild.) Found a merchant, filled my inventory... and realized that, at
10 stone per pick, I was at more than 300 weight and had an agility of 2. After
5 minutes of trying to reach the shop's door, I turned around, swallowed my
greed, and sold back most of the picks.

Bah!
