My best and only take on this: Verant should not have built a combat
arena for the uber-duber-super Sleeper where any kind of strategy
could be used at all.  A square box with no doors is the only space
Verant seems to be capable of handling.  And no scripts, Verant should
NOT be allowed to script their own game.

First you had monsters that spells could not touch, examples like the
Reavers in City of Mist.  Then came monsters that went insane if you
meleed them and auto-riposted (giants), area-lifetapped (VS), or just
plain booted you out of the zone (Nagafen, Vox).  Now you have a giant
sleeping human that spews area-no-casters-work vomit, death touches,
summons, and basically flexes his biceps until you are all dead.

If you build a monster that fantastically tough, you have to expect
the guilds to get fantastically tough back.

The Sleeper was purpose-built to defeat normal play tactics, you
cannot deny.  A zergling rush of 100 lvl 60 warriors would not be
enough.  Massed chain-nuking by 100 lvl 60 Wizards would not be
enough.  After you've recovered from the zone crashing from all that
going on, the only thing left is to use each of your abilities to the
bleeding edge.

Verant now comes across as a spoiled child, that awful GM you had
playing D&D in seventh grade who got pissed if you beat his
encounters; like a child they are now punishing the guild for their
own shortcomings.

/sigh

It's not that it is a bad game..  It's that if they had responsible,
solid professionals at the helm instead of MuD rejects then it could
have been an excellent game.
