Oh, we do. At least the MA/SA/ Mezzer. But the point is, you still
*take* them so they can share in the loot, upgrade their kits, etc. with
stuff that they can use in xp grind groups to level up. And, of course,
to stop our incessant whinging which would follow otherwise.

Oh, I'm not saying we don't dish out some fair damage, and we can
certainly *take* more than the other damage dealers if the shit hits the
fan. Point is, if you're trying to do a given target with "x" number of
raiders (x being a challengingly low number) I'd certainly want those
extra slots filled with monks and rogues before I'd want to stick extra
warriors in them. But I think you and I already agree on that much.

Then again, never underestimate the power of meat shield whining in /gu
chat or on the guild boards. :-p
