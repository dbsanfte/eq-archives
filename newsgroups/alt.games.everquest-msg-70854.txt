Y'know, sometimes it just isn't your day .....

My 23 ranger is in Everfrost soloing mammys this morning.  First pull is
yellow, no problem with the kill.  Second pull, though, is tough.  To make
matters worse, I fizzle 5 straight Ignites (I really needed that mana).
It's getting the rolls ... I'm down to two bubs of health and decide to
regroup.  Root it, back off, and heal myself.  Then med a bit.  When root
breaks, I stand up, face the mammy ... and root myself firmly to the ground.

Here, Mr. Mammy ... please kill me.  I'm too stupid to live.

Ah, there's a white mammy on track ... easy pickings.  I can get some of my
XP back, and maybe a tusk if I'm lucky.  Snare, burn burn burn etc., then
turn to fight.  Fear it ... man, I'm not hitting this thing worth crap.  It
turns, fear it again.  Good thing I'm kicking it hard, because I'm sure not
hitting it.  It turns, I'm oom.  As I'm about to die, I realize that I
forgot to turn on attack.

Recover corpse, and decide it's time to play Bejeweled.  I'm obviously ~not~
in the EQ groove today.  :-)

Crash (I'd go fishing, but I'd probably break my pole)
