I've never had a problem in FV. Avoid that necros area (who's rarely there -
when he is he's by the mouth of the river), and just keep your eyes out for
the spiders - they've got a very small agro radius. I used to run through
there regularily at about 17. Dreadlands on the other hand, if you've not
got invis or are not there at peak times, is a deathtrap for the lower
levels.

Having said that, I'm not really a great advocate for the Lake due to the
amount of idiots there, and if you really are scared of the drachnids
obviously that would put you off!
