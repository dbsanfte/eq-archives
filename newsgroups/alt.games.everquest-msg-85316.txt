My enchanter is level 56.  I didn't say "Argh, what a waste of time!"  If it
was a waste I wouldn't have many of my research-only spells.

So your advice to all level 16s is not to do research?  Just out of
curiosity, where are they going to find research-only spells a year from
now, when NO ONE does research because of your advice?  This game has little
turn-over, but turn-over DOES exist.
