*SNIP*

I totally feel with you. This is NOT acceptable. Maybe - just maybe - I
could accept their explanations if the quest had some elaborate storyline
that actually made it clear and logical that your faction couldn't be higher
that X.
However, an explanation just involving their stupid attempt to stop MQ's,
cheats etc., is just not good enough.
SOE, that completely sucks! And the fact that you won't accept
responsibility for this bull just adds to your already dubious reputation
for non-customer service.

Pirg, I wish there were something that could be done to help you.
I'm thinking maybe some sort of unified petition? Maybe a website where ppl.
could comment on this? I don't know...
