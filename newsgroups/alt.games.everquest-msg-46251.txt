I actually considered selling my Anarchy online account, box, level 33
doctor MA with armor and stuff a few levels ahead (so far ahead she
had to wear implants to use it) beta client and patches burned onto
cdroms, etc for what I basically paid for it at the store.  However,
after hearing how funcom screwed the game up even more to the point
where its unplayable sort of now and after doing that they are
basically pulling a verant on their message boards, I could not wish
this game on my worst enemy. 

Would sending the game back to a gaming company complete with some
fecal matter be a federal offense possibly? I bet it would since the
fecal matter could be considered a contagion or something. Darn, guess
I'll have to just be satisfied with breaking it and throwing it away.
