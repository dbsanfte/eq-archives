Bah sarcasm dosent suit you . I make fresh homemade pizza in less than a
minute . That qualifies it as raid food . I refuse to sacrifice quality
though :p . I make my own homemade bread too but since that takes 4 hrs it
does not qualify as raid food . The sliced beef sandwhiches it makes from
yesterdays bread do though :p

As for the tortillas I usually buy them premade since it dosent seem to
degrade the quality any . I would be tempted to soak my own beans but I
usually just use beef,chicken , or bacon since I like it so much better .
Bacon quesidillas are just grande and dont take too much time . They dont
count as raid food either since they have a tendency to be messy, and
replacing the $10 keyboard every month would get annoying .
