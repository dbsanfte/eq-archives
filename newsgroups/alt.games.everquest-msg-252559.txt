Graeme led me to an interesting tangent, and I'd be interested on your 
take on it:

If I own the plat (or 'control access to it'), and we agree that it (or 
the 'control' of it) has value, and we agree the courts should recognize 
property crime like fraud...

Then, in games like UO, AC1 Darktide, or on some EQ PvP servers... or 
any game where players have the ability to 'forcibly' take 'property' 
from other players against their will, property which has real legally 
recognized value... isn't that theft? Real theft? Real, honest to god, 
*criminal theft*?!

I'm rapidly beginning to think that even if plat and items have monetary 
value, there is no way in hell the courts should recognize it.
