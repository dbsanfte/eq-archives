actually I have not noticed anything too awe inspiring about having stamina
up high as much as str

imho 65 hp is nice, but compared to an added 10-20 points per hit it seems
to fall short

so far I have (plus or minus a couple pts, just off the top of my head):
153str 101agi 102dex 139int 80sta with mostly rygorr and sentient boots
bracer and helm

I havent tried less str and more sta, but have tried less str and I know its
a major contributing factor in how hard I hit

(thx for noting the df arms, corrected :)

str
