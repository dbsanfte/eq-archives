True, DirectX has taken over in the gaming world.....OpenGL is still common
in the CAD area....

Yup, Verant did, not Microsoft....

Hard to say, as a developer you can get a developers account from MS and
download just about anything they've ever made...MSDOS, win95,etc...I'd
guess that all the major dx releases are there.....

And as far as the consumer goes, MOST of the time the DX is backwards
compatible, example, I have had DX8.0a on my machine for moths, it runs DX7
games, etc.....
