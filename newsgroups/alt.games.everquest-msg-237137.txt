Sorry, I wasn't clear.  I was asking about the Crematory compared
to the Plant.  Yes, the crematory is VASTLY easier.  However, the
XP sucked rocks :-P  We were seeing 1% AA per 2 mobs in the outside
of the Crematory, and 2.5% aa per mob in the outside of the Plant.

Occasionally I'd offtank a Plant mob with my kitty (6-6.1k hp depending
if our druid is there, 1150ish AC).

The advantage we have over groups with 'chanters slowing is I slow
on incoming.  We actually went in with an enchanter the other day (into
the Crematory) and I had to laugh at the message indicating my 65%
slow had worn off (because his had hit) when the mob was already at 50%
health and falling fast.

Yeah, there's a wanderer in the first room that will path all the way to
the entrance.

I still believe I can duo there, but I'd vastly prefer a full group
in the Plant.
