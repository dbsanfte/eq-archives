    In XP groups you do. Too bad they don't need to sit on their asses to
get back HPs, the cleric does it in one spell cast. Amazingly, the warrior
can continue to do damage while that cleric sits on his ass, gaining back
mana. The same cannot be said of the wizard in the same group - they stand
to deal damage, they stop medding.

    Graffe's has a lot of parses of XP group DPS. You really should go read
it sometime, as they take into account things like time spent looking for
mobs that the standard "DPS = mana regen x damage/mana on best nuke"
analysis doesn't. It still doesn't come out in the wizard's favour, though,
unless you specifically build a group to utilize a wizard's best ratio
spells - AoE spells. And that means wizards get passed over for the sorts of
pickup groups that everyone else gets invited into. (Whether that's
important is a different topic.)
