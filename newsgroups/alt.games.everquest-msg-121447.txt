The zone to Tox is near the newbie zone tunnel.  Go to the drop off for the
hole, and follow along the wall, you'll eventually find it.  The zone back
to Tox forest is to the left of the path leading to the newbie area.
    And if someone tells you the guards won't attack you...don't believe
them.  I lost some EXP and made a corpse run due to that.  They obey the
rules of any other guards, only some claim with slightly smaller agro
radius.  If you've got invis, mez, SoW, or anything similar, run between
them to the Warrens.  (you are referring to the guards that you pass between
on your way into the newbie zone right?)
