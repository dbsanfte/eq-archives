Recently an ex-guildmember Enchantress spent the better part of an
hour and a half enchanting 5 bags of Brellium for me.  I then spent 3
hours using up everything she'd enchanted.

I had a couple of failures on making blocks, sheets, and rings, but
*not a single failure* on making the actual armour.

Imbued Enchanted Dwarven Plate:

Gorget (went from 202 to 203 on this one)
Boots
Gauntlets

Then I threw caution to the wind:

Breastplate
Greaves
Vambrace
Bracer
Bracer

Did I mention that I'm a *really* happy smith?


Reyder Axeman, Xegony.
Really happy Paladin of Brell.
