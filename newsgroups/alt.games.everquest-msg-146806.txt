Most druids I know eagerly awaited this rumored upgrade
to their epic, and are delighted it came thru.  It wasn't a
"stealth" anything, they knew it was coming.  And it
sure as Brell was nothing at all resembling a nerf.

Old epic wouldn't stick to snare immune mobs, was
overwritten by necro epic, and overwrote any existing
snare (other than necro epic, I suppose) and was
resisted more often than it is now, due to a second
check to see if snare portion was resisted.  Worst,
though, was the fact that the snare on it lasted far
less time than Ensnare, which is a cheap quick casting
spell.  Using epic to resnare a mob which had outlived
the original epic snare was nearly impossible, since
the cast time was long enough for an unsnared mob to
catch and likely kill the caster.  Brell, roaming mobs
would literally walk out of range by the time the cast
was complete, making it difficult to use to pull with.

Could these factors be overcome?  Sure.  But now
you don't have to worry about any of them, and the
only cost is that you have to keep ensnare memmed
to use even on lowbie mobs who would have died
before the epic ran out... but honestly, is there a druid
out there who doesn't keep a snare memmed just in
case?  Brell's Beard, if they are that short lived, mem
your level 1 snare!
