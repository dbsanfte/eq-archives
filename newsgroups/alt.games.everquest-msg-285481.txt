So here's what I ended up with

Compaq V2602XT
AMD Sempron Mobile 3000+
256 MB DDR PC2700 RAM (1 DIMM)
40 GB Hard Drive
CD-RW/DVD ROM combo drive
56K modem |10/100 NIC | 802.11G
ATI RADEON XPRESS 200
AC 97 Audio
14.1 WXGA High-Definition BrightView
Windows XP Home

Actually, it appears the Radeon card is 200M, not 200 (I was warned to 
avoid the 200P, but had no information about the M

The memory is a single card, and there are two slots for cards, so I 
plan to buy two 512M cards, so that two machines have those while the 
other two machines get two 256M cards each.

There's also an empty PC card slot, no idea what I might be able to pop 
in there, is there a card based HD equivalent?

I currently have a Linksys wireless G router running in the house, with 
my DSL plugged into it so our machines can share the internet 
connection; is this workable for the built in 801.11G wi fi connection 
on the machines?

Waiting on the batteries to charge, according to the instructions I 
should charge full before starting them up.  Grr, these things are 
taking longer to pop than Stormfeather!
