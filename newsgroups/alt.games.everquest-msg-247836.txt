I've used the AE spell trick to get the named whirling dervish out of 
the canyon walls in Beholder maze. Also got 2 goblins who were hiding 
there as well :)

Also if you can track to the spot. Sitting on top of the NPC sometimes 
triggers Sit Aggro.

Hehe! found that with Hill Giants in Eastern Karana. One day I wanted a 
rest. So I went to the top of the hill. Looked around saw nothing 
nearby. So sat down!

Bang! I was being hit by a Hill Giant. I ran he popped out of the 
ground. I was dead in no time. Due to his bash stopping me running.

Hehe! I am more careful where I sit now :)

Oh! and there is a "Shadowed Man" under the hill in Nektulos Forest I've 
never got out from under the ground.  None of  the above tricks worked 
on him :(

This bug is as old as EQ. DX9 just changed where it occurs and who it 
effects :)
