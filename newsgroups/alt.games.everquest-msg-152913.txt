Hard to say. They may once in a while but I doubt the read it on a regular basis.
Brad Mcquaid used to read and post here. Google can prove that.
But the group quickly filled with Verant bashers and idiot posters that
had BRAD READ THIS!! on every subject. Usually with a demand about some
insane ass stupid feature that no one with a brain would implement in the game.
So Brad stopped posting here, thank god.

If I were them I'd read every board and newsgroup about EQ I could
but I would never post to them. Just stay in lurk mode, and get the
general feel for the whole community rather than a few vocal idiots
with no lives that post to get attention.
