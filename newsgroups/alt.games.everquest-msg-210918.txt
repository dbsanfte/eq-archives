Malachite is cheap even as an untwinked level 4.  By 24 its a joke, the only
trouble with malachite is having to carry it around, eating loot carrying slots,
but since it comes in stacks of 20 thats not a huge problem either normally.  I
guess with a pet dying every mob, its more of an issue.

These plan doesn't seem like they would work, though.  Isn't damage the pet does
attributed to the mage?  I'm very surprised to hear that killing the pet would
wipe the damage away as if the mage had zoned.  Not impossible, but very
surprising.

It sounds as if you've used these methods successfully, which would mean that
I'm wrong about the details of how exp works with pets involved.

Summoning a new pet every mob doesn't seem like an efficient way to PL, thats a
pretty hefty mana cost to pay.  Plus the pets will be fairly wimpy, no burnout,
no items... unless I'm to gear them up as well which will increase the mana cost
per kill even further.  Seems like it would be simpler to just throw a nuke
calibrated to do 40% damage or so!

Here's my thinking.  The goal is to increase the kills per hour for the shaman
by any means available.  High mana cost approaches aren't good if I don't have
the mana supply to keep them running constantly.  So what I want to do is figure
out how to speed her up without spending a lot of mana.  Seems to me a pet near
her level should be able to do just a bit less damage than she does.  If I (or
my pet) is doing say 10DPS and she's doing 11 DPS, then she'll outdamage him.
And I can speed things along then via DS, which is unattributed damage,
effectively just reducing the damage she and the pet have to do for a kill.  If
DS is the only thing I have to cast, then my mana should hold out just fine.  If
we decide to have pet tank then I can also heal him without getting any credit
for it, and she can work on outdamaging him via spells.

Which pet to use is another question.  Earth pet will keep mob rooted, which
means no runners and easy escape for the shaman in case it gets too rough... but
it also means mobs won't run away so they do 20% more damage per lifetime  And
his damage output is relatively low, which means I could perhaps use a higher
level one and still not outdamage her.  Fire pet has a better DS than my cast
one if he's tanking, and decent damage output anyway.   Water pet has I think
the best damage output, which might not be in my best interest under the
circumstances.  Air pet, though, stuns, and this means reducing the mob damage
output.  If shaman is tanking, then thats probably the best thing we can do,
keep the mob from hurting her so much, which means saving her mana in terms of
not having to heal herself so much.
