Yep, open doors isn't as important as the find traps and remove traps
will be in LDoN find traps can skill up anywhere, keep mashing it.

I have a hot key 

/attack off
/doability ? (backstab)
/doability ? (hide)
/doability ? (pick pockets)
/doability ? (sense traps)

Just do it, you dont loot that much when you do, and anyone that
worried about the money is probably a twink anyway. If you loot
something big or a lot of cash do a /split

If someone really whines about it, they are probably pulling a fast
one themselves. Just be polite, and if you want do a /split. You need
PP skill in the end game, and 50th level is tough to pick it up,
believe me.

This hotkey is important, zone in and mash it, turn and mash it, if
you mash it again you return to normal run speed. You hide and sneak
will get you out of trouble faster than running.

DOnt ignore this! NO dont!

Use two pierceers til thats maxed, then 1hs and 1hb. I used to use a
whip. If the offhand weapon is slow ditch it and get a fast one. I
have a training loadout and a raid loadout. My weapons are fast as I
can get for taining, and highest ratio for raid.
 
One other annyoing thing, use CON when hiding and sneaking. Dont get
caught stealing cookies from KoS mobs cause they see invis.

Get yourself good AGIL STR and DEX items. I also look for STA items.
Learn pottery and make your own poison vials, and dont overlook them.
Choking Asmag isnt a bad dot. Other poison combinations pay off in
time.

You are not a tank, it is all about aggro. If you stand toe to toe you
lose. You need to make sure your tank has aggro, if he doesn't evade
(stop-hide-sneak) and wait til he has it. If the mob keeps beating on
you keep mashing evade.
