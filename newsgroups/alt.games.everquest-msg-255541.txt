Earlier, I went to Abysmal sea and did the smithing quests, just as 
annoying as the tailoring quests, and I did the same thing: 100 of the 
first, second and third steps, and only enough of the fourth step to cap 
out my skill at 54.

I didn't go on to get my skill any higher, though.

Even earlier, I'd picked up a rhino horn and HQ walrus hide while moving 
thru the prison area, both very easy drops.

After getting the skill up, I wandered around EW for a while till 
finally stumbling across a skinning rock.

Still later I found myself in POK, so I ran over to one of the forges 
and did the combine, success first time (trivial is 41 I'm told)

So, when I got done with the second ring, I was immediately able to do 
the third ring, handing in the skinning knife and second ring, owning 
the latter no more than 20 seconds, enough to link it to my friend.
