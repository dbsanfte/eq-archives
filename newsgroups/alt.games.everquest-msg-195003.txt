Aye, I hadn't realized how much the shaman suffers from lack of snare; I
considered it since I've often regretted not making a DE cleric for the same
necklace. I just didn't think it would be nearly as important, lacking fear.

Anyone who -does- have a snare using shaman have any comments?  Is it really
useful, or is the duration so short that its just a curiousity, nice perhaps
for stopping runners but little else?  How about resists, as you level up
does it become hard to land, or is it like Flash of Light, sticks to almost
everything?

I went with Iksar because of the regen (can trolls be Innorruk shaman or just
ogres?), the AC bonus (since shaman can't wear plate anyway, getting a AC
bonus for not being able to wear plate seemed like a good deal) for the
thought that I could actually fit into that "jarcrap" junk that always rots
in KC and perhaps like it (had a cleric once that could use it, but since she
could wear plate the AC on it seemed low.  Shaman are stuck with chain
anyway, I figure!) but mostly because I'd only tinkered around with a couple
lizzies before for 5 or 6 levels each, and thought I'd give it a stronger
shot this time, what with POP transportation so I wouldn't have to suffer so
much from being universally despised by the soft skins.
