The trick to doing the canni-dance is to get the best of both worlds,
you catch the mediate tick then hit your canni hotkey and sit back
down before the next med tick. It becomes 2nd nature after a while. 

... or these days, just say screw it and get a horse <g>. 

Canni hotkey is something like:
/sit off
/cast 5
/cast 5 (catches fizzle) 
/pause 15
/sit on

These days, given KEI, horses, stoicism it's less important so a lot
of people don't bother. Used to be a big deal back in the old days.
