I've seen quite a few people in this newsgroup complain about people who 
can't (or won't) play their characters class correctly so I thought I 
would ask this question. My Druid is lvl 26, nearly 27, and until now 
has almost exclusively been soloed. I've been in a few groups in the 
early levels, but the Druid skills didn't really come into play. If I 
join a group now, how will I be "expected" to play as a 26 Druid by the 
other players in the group ?

Sorry if this is a dumb question but I don't want to get a reputation 
for being no good in a group.

Thanks,

Jon.

p.s On a completely different note, on the picture you get after you 
"Enter World" there is a some kind of castle in the top left (I think). 
Is that in the game and if so where. I'd like to go and see it. Thanks.
