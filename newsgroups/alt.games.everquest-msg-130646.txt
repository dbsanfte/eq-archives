I doubt that either qualifies as "unbiased". Possibly one is
less or differently biased than the other. Quite simply I wouldn't
trust a US source to be unbaised on this subject.

Probably the best test for a news source lacking bias in this
matter would be if they attract equal complains from both pro-Israeli
and pro-Palestinian quarters.

I just had a look at several TV news websites.
Sky: mentions Bush wanting Arafat voted out.
CNN: has a story about the IDF stopping a car bomb.
Foxnews: has a story of Arafat atempting to open dialogue with Colin
Powell (This is actually an Associated Press story).
BBC: had no stories about Israel or Palestine
ITN: ditto.
