Not everyone does the /report. And the "logs" mentioned track
character inventory, not their actions. They track what items a player
had and what happened to it if they do not have it anymore - given
away, dropped, destroyed, consumed, etc. I beleive an item lost to a
bug will have no "what happened" log.
