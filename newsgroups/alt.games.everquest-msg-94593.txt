Well,

So far no one has expressed any real interest.
No I am not a troll but, I dont feel I have anything to prove to anyone.
If no one cares, hey then that is fine also.
No I am not involved in the incident. I personally
have spoken to GMs possibly 7 times at most in three years.
The only comment up until this time was that GMs never
help.
