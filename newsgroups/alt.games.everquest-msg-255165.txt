And boy did he kick their asses. I am no fan of Brenlo's but he put
those whiney "I want everything now, by myself, with no effort!" twits
in their place bigtime.

This was a response in a thread where a bunch of whining casual
powergamers were complaining about no solo ldons being on the front
burner.

Here's the quote:

"I see a lot of folks saying that they are casual players and don't
have time to group.  EQ has always been about grouping.  Nothing in
the 5 year history of the game has changed that.  If you have made it
to 65, as a casual player, you most likely had to group.  Grouping has
been and will always be a necessary part of advancement in EQ, even if
we decide to add Solo adventure zones. 
 
"Raiding on the other hand is optional.  If you want the bigger
rewards, then you will have to raid.  The amount of group content as
compared to raid content is enormous and there is much that can be
done in short amounts of time with a group.  There are over 200
hundred zones in EQ.  Many unused, but capable of supporting small
group encounters for an hour or two.  Omens will have fewer raid
content and more group content than Gates did.  It will not require
many flags to progress so few zones will be locked to any players but
it will still require a group effort for the most part, as EQ always
has.
 
"I am what you have labeled as a casual player.  I have a few
characters in the 60s and I am nowhere as hardcore as many of you.  I
have been playing for over 5 years now.  I have only raided twice.  I
can logon and find plenty to do in a couple hours of play time.  I
know that I am not going to get the cool Time or Gates gear unless I
raid and I okay with that.  That is not a time investment I want to
make, nor is it the way I choose to play the game. 
 
"So is this argument that you have nothing to do outside of raiding if
you are a casual player?  Which I believe, and I know many of you will
agree, is false.   Or is this argument really about wanting the raid
awards (loot) without having to raid?


...and we all know its Door #2....
