You'll note he actually said "I am a Cleric and I refuse to go running 
for KEI."  Of course your argument works much better if you put words
in his mouth.  At 61, fighting in areas where it takes half an hour
or more simply to fight to our spot - anyone who leaves to go get
KEI will probably be replaced, at the very least they are on their own
to make it back to the group - we aren't evaccing and fighting in 
again.

No, "xx who REFUSES to get KEI LFG" means he refuses to get it,
not that he refuses it if it is offered - do you see the difference?
 
> Why refuse to get KEI?  

Because he doesn't want to hold up the entire group while he
goes running off for it?  Because he doesn't want to be bound
fighting in zones/areas that are an easy run to PoK or Nexus?
Try fighting in places where it's impossible to get back to 
the group unless they all evac out and everyone fights back in
someday - you'd be pretty ticked off if you had to stop everything
because someone felt they could not function without KEI.

Clarity is more than sufficient to keep <46 groups going - if 
you want it, just invite an enchanter or bard to group with you.
