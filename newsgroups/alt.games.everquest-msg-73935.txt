There is no EQ2. It also looks as though instead of making EQ2 they
are just upgrading EQ (dx 8.1, Luclin, new models, etc) This is quite
a bit different than what UO was going to be to UO2 (was really sad to
see that go.. stupid EA marketing people) They can REALLY upgrade EQ a
lot as they go along while still having the most content of any
mmorpg. They've already shown that in the switch to dx8 and Luclin
with luclin models and such.

I think its going to be a bit like the UO UO2 thing, only make sense
this time, and they will not have an EQ2 at all. They seem to instead
be making OTHER games for possibly different market share like Star
Wars Galaxies and Planetside. I bet verant won't make another medieval
mmorpg until EQ is quite dead as far as subscribers. I mean, if SWG
has say 600,000 month to month subscribers which is MORE than possible
(knowing EQ gets over 400,000 now) and EQ still retains a large
customer base also then why bother?

They've never really mentioned EQ2 themselves. The only mention of it
was in what some supposed hacker found on Brad McQuaids computer
alluding to EQ2. In retrospect though even that could have possibly
been talking about luclin (if it happened at all)
