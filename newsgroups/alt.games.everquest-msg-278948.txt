Right it was the post I responded to, Vidden. Sorry about the confusion.

You don't need scaling zones for that. Within reason many EQ1 zones are 
like that. 

In fact most dungeons from Unrest to SolA to LGuk to Befallen were 
suitable for level ranges spanning 20-30 levels. And what's more as you 
levelled up you could return to the dungeon and do a different piece of 
it.

Its more fun like that imo. LDoNs are dull because they are exactly the 
same as you level up. Lower Guk or Solusek B is fun, as you level up you 
push deeper and deeper into new areas and new named. There's a reason to 
go back every few levels and see what you can do.

You've seen splitpaw with your 28th level character, and done it all. 
What's the incentive to go back later and do the same thing again once 
the novelty of the 'new zone' has worn off. There's never going to be a 
question of 'can I do this now?' or 'How deep can I go?' The answers are 
always "of course you can! we scaled it to your capabilities", and "all 
the way, we scaled it to your capabilities... just like every other time 
you've ever been here".
