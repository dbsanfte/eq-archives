    Actually, this is the first I've read of it only being "a few hundred 
points". The other posts in the thread indicated the items would be tribute 
priced approximately the same as droppables of the same quality, less some 
sort of discount.

    Honestly, a few hundred guild tribute points is worthless. The officers 
in my guild would rather keep the rotted item and use it as a source of 
humorous links or hand it to the Tactics gnome than hand it in for less than 
ten minutes' use of one of the many guild tribute abilities.

    50 pp items get deleted so I have bag space. That won't make the grade.
