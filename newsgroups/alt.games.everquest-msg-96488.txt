??
Ro's Fiery Sundering is the first 'Drop Only' spell a Druid has to go
hunting for... so not many Druids have it at 45 and below.

And quoting the 3 lowest mana costs for spells a Druid CAN use (no grouping
druid should use root) is a good way of showing your ignorance about a class
;o)

It's not as effective as Sow... and has HALF the duration of SoW.
So... are you going to cast Pack Spirit twice as often for reduced benefit?
Or SoW individually for usefulness?
Even in a 6 person group, Pack Spirit is no more efficient than Single
Target SoW... and with a reduced effect... THAT'S why most Druids don't use
it.

Half wit... if it hits the fan, that's what Succour is for.
