Read your history( actually not yours Britain's ). That was NOT the point of
it at all. Laws used to control were written down no matter who they
controlled. One document was to control the king for the benefit of the
barons came into existance some time ago. It was called the Magna Carta; you
may have heard of it. Laws to control were always written down. The only
case I can come up with where this wasn't so was the rule of thumb.
