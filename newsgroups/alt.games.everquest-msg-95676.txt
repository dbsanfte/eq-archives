Ogre with 220ish smithing here, so it is doable. STR is a modifier for
smithing skill-ups in much the same way as INT/WIS is, and I didn't seem
to have much trouble getting to 175 on storebought stuff. Once you move
onto hunted items (leather padding) it slows down immensely though.

Invest in some +str and +int gear as a 'smithing kit' as well as a +cha
set for buying the materials.

Never seemed too tough when we've pulled them. Usually just 'another mob
to kill' when clearing to Stat/AoW. Definitely miles easier than Vindi.
Unsure on respawn times since we only ever kill them when AoW is up. 

Maybe you could ask the statue or AoW capable guild on your server if
you could loot the piece if no guildies want. If they're doing Statue or
AoW regularly anyway, it's doubtful any of them would put in the time
for such a tough quest with rewards less than they could loot. I'm sure
if you're polite, keep out of the way, and promise to leave as soon as
you're looted it, there prolly wouldn't be a problem. Even easier if you
know people in the guild and can get them to ask on your behalf, rather
than 'cold calling'.
