Heres another tip; make your request an enjoyable play experience
for the person in question, and not just begging, no matter how
dressed up.

I've been offered baked spider legs oh so yummy for buffs - they got
them. 

I've heard of someone levelling (yes, fighting) in Ro and having
a little halfling rogue sneak up behind them invis and suddenly scream

"NOBODY MOVE! PAWS IN THE AIR! This is a STICK UP! Ya better cast that
SoW on me now so I can get away quick an nobody dies! Thats right! 
Move it puppypaws! .............................. please?"

That sort of thing, where they've come to you and exhibited some
charm and wit to improve YOUR play time as well as their own almost
always gets a sow.

Interestingly, both my main toons can sow - a 60 ranger, and a 36
druid. 

I get asked for SoW and ports (yes, ports) maybe once a week on
the ranger, and dont mind doing it.

I get asked for Sow, regen, thorns, buffs, sld, ports, PL me plz,
around 10-20 times a day on the druid, *and* its getting noticably
worse more recently.

This may illustrate why druids are noticably more cranky than others.

Its not about the mana, its about the building frustration of being
unable to immerse yourself in your relaxing escapist world of
heroic deeds without it being interrupted and disturbed every 10
minutes by people, MOST of whom are neither polite nor reasonable
if you are busy.

You have to work hard to distinguish yourself from the real beggars;
and if you think working a lil to make it an enjoyable experience
for the person you're asking a favour for is unfair, I'll take that
as an example of extreme selfishness... I dont imagine you would
think that though ;)

Sui, generally fluffy SoWWer ;)
