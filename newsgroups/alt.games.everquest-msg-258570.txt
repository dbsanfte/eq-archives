I can speak for shamans. Our best heal is a ratio of 2.8 and we don't
get that 'till 62. Our best HoT is 6 and we get that at 65, but HoTs
don't keep the tank alive in a raid encounter. (Well at least not
without a CHeal chain to back him up.)

Our best nuke is a ratio of 3, don't get it until 64. Our best DoT is
a ratio of 6 but takes 2.6 minutes to get full effect.

So we don't do either of the healing of the damage or the doing of the
damage very well. (Compared to Clerics or Wizards, for sure.)

But look at it this way, HP only matters to one person, the MT. If the
ranger can regen 150HP per tick, does it ~really~ matter? Sure it will
save some mana here and there, but even 150HP regen isn't going to
keep a ranger alive against the truly nasty mobs, as MT. So what you
have is even at the regens that are allowed, you still need someone to
heal the MT, usually several someones, and a bunch of casters in the
background doing their best to take down the mob.

So while HP is worth intrinsically only 4 for every 1 Mana, there are
usually about 4 other people in the group casting spells with only one
person using HP. So in effect HP has a value of 16 to 1 against Mana.

My logic may be flawed, but that's what occurred to me.
