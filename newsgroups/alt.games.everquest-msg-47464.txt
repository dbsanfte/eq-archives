You can not go to either one of those continents without the expansion
packs, correct. And be very careful: you CAN be teleported in but if you
don't have the expansions, you will crash on landing and will NOT be able
to retrieve your corpse. I don't know if you can zone in (are the boats
visible if you don't have the expantions?) You also miss out on the spiffy
visuals for Kunark and Velious items.

We Americans do not have a right to oversee
our leaders, to demand upfront accountability
of their actions and to question their every
decision; this is the moral imperative and
duty of every citizen.
