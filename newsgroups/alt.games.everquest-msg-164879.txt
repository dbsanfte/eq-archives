 Keep in perspective. I feel the need to justify nothing to impress you. Who
are you to me ?   Nobody :-) If you feel I'm an idiot, then why do you read.
Better yet, ask yourself why you even replied. Are you better then everyone
else who tried to shut me up ? Do you think that today is the day !! I will
stop him !!!!. Don't flatter yourself faggot, you ain't crap in my book and
I personally don't give a flying fck about your feeble attempt to analyze my
words

 Now, go back too your kiddy porn sites and stop sticking your nose in where
it can get cut off.

 Now, go spread your cheer to others you "Supposedly" kill-file.
