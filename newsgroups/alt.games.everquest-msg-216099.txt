Since you can only have 5 lines per hotkey, how does that work?

IF they don't understand easy phrases like No Pulling, Out of Mana, how
likely are they to understand it in their own language; "pulling" is a
specialized term that doesn't mean "causing a monster to come over and start
beating on us" in english, "mana" is a specialized term that doesn't mean
"power to magically heal/damage/control" in english.  The only language
troubles I've ever really had were with korean guild, and even they
understood and used simple things like OOM and 50M and so forth... I have no
idea what word they used for "pulling" but do no rim sah an enraged ulthork
was still pretty clearly an incoming message, particularly when it was
coming from the puller and similar phrases were repeated with different mob
names every time he'd pull something

I'm not clear on what you are saying, perhaps instead of french spanish and
german you should work on your english.  As a healer I have no desire to
stay at 30% mana, and as a healer, no matter how good at timing my heals I
might be, I am not ultimately in control of my mana bar; the question is how
hard the tank is getting hit, how often, how many mobs, how much (if any)
time between mobs, what his HP total is and what his defenses are like; none
of which I can control by timing my spell casting.  Not as a cleric (65),
shaman (51), druid (only 34) or any other class I've played.  IF you are
playing at a constant 30% mana, then you could just as easily play at a
constant 90% mana, and have a lot more mana in case of trouble; perhaps with
3 times as large a mana pool you'd not lose people when that "damned ikky
monk" wanders past.
