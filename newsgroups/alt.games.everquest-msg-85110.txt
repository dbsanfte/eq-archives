First, as a rule of thumb you can double an employee's salary to get 
cost of employment, your 116 suddenly becomes 58.  Second, 2k per month 
isn't exactly big bucks, employer costs at that salary level are 
probably actually higher than that (we'll assume that they can find 
enough people willing to endure the abuse of a pack of 8000 emotionally 
retarded video game players convinced that they have paid for the right 
to abuse said employees), so now you're down to 50 or fewer potential CS 
employees.  Finally, they are surely not doing this without expectation 
of turning a profit, so if you're lucky there'll be 20-25 CS employees 
dedicated to the server.  Divide those 25 folks amongst the constant 
flood of demands for special content and special treatment and I'll bet 
that there won't be all that much difference between the "ghetto" 
servers and the Legends server when you take that 10khp fall due to a 
terrain bug (i.e. you'll _probably_ get answered before the rez timer 
expires, and maybe if you're lucky you'll hear from somebody within 5 
minutes).
