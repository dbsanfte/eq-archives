Out of all the craptastic stuff going on in that thread and James'
description of it here, this is the part that really got to me initally
and had me boggling.

(Edit: my emphasis added on last word.)

By who's fucking decision? I guess that's all I'd really like to know.
Sure, if any of the guilds can do it alone, they would. If they tried
the encounter and realized they couldn't, and were willing to band
together to give it a shot, who is it that's making these rules that
they can't? Is your guild leader a GM or some other employee of SoE? I
didn't think so. So you're not making those kinds of rules.

If and when we run into a flag mob that we just can't beat, this would
be a no brainer for me. If another guild of a similar level to us
invited to go along against that mob to get everyone flagged and our
raid leader said yes, you can bet your ass I'd be there in a heartbeat
with no regrets. Would the top dog guild on our server bitch? I really
don't know, nor do I give a rat's ass. But you may rest assured that if
they started posting bullshit all over the web about how we weren't
"allowed" to do it if we couldn't do it just with our guild alone I'd be
among the first to be responding in big, bold capital letters that they
were cordially invited to go fuck themselves.

I'd also have loved to have been a fly on the wall in whatever smoke
filled back room it was where *that* little gem was settled on. There's
a lot of posts making it look like somehow James' guild is the "injured
party" here, but something definitely smells about this whole "deal".
