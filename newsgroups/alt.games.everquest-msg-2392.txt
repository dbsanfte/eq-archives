I'm assuming you mean the tome of order/discord.  Well, if you want to be a
playerkiller you give it to a priest of discord.  You will then be able to
kill other pks and they will be able to kill you.  Or you can put it in the
bank and save it in case you think you might want to become a pk later on or
you can destroy it and not be a pk.  Other than that I don't know anything
else about paladins.
