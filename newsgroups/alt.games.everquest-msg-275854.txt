Heh, yes, just the behaviour to watch out for if you are rash enough
to say you are a female player, when gaming.  Actually, it's amazing
how many male players have some lovelorn idiot following them around
because their character is female :D

On a slight tangent, I have struck up some in-game friendships with EQ
players, and, after a few weeks of teaming up, some turned out to be
female gamers.  According to most of them, they had never played a
male character, and thought it odd that men would play a female
character.  One lady in particular was stunned when, after some weeks
of teaming up as a duo, I said something in passing that indicated I
was a man - I had assumed she knew already, having been introduced by
another female gamer who knew us both.  She was dumbfounded, and
thought I was kidding her, and it took me some while to convince her.
She thought women played female characters and men played male
characters, and that was that.
