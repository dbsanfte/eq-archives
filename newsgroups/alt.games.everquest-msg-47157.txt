Unfortunately this dungeon is kinda screwy, not sure if much would
even be blue for a level 16 until moderately far in. Most of the mobs
only go up to a certain point then you have the boss mobs which are
blue to a level 34 or something (mugglewump, king, etc)
Maybe a group of 16 pluses could take some of them I don't know.

You might actually do better at 16 grouping in stonebrunt.. which you
can just run to from warrens. But you will end up with the same
problem you mention in warrens, lack of people.

The stuff that drops from those mobs blue up to a 34 is really pretty
mediocre. Its all also no drop yet very single class/race oriented
(for example the erud sk helm which reclaims energy, I've never had
that drop when an erud sk was even in the zone) On an established
server it is fairly poor loot, even for non twinks.

This zone may have its first usefulness on the FV roleplay server
since I guess virtually nothing on that server is no drop, so there
will finally be a point to doing this area at the appropriate levels. 
I was messing around on FV test with a shaman and even the quest stuff
like parts for a quest and final products such as the tribunal
initiate neck thing are all droppable/tradeable. Even the box you put
the bones in for the pally bone quest (I saved bone chips from newbing
in halas, and went from start of level 5 to level 6 with 50 bone
chips.. ooh!) is tradeable after its combined.

I don't think very many people like it much. For coming at such an
advanced stage in the game its really one of the worst zones. 
The only way warrens and stonebrunt would get enough traffic is if
they were dumped off of east commons or something instead of where
they are. You might actually have more traffic then you'd want though
then ;)

The main problem besides design is that its in the odus area. Odus
just really sucks to get to unless you have a porter to get you there.
The erud boat is super slow, never having been upgraded like the
butcher/freeport one was in speed or the addition of another boat. I
think the fact that qeynos really never became as densely populated as
the freeport area has something to do with it also. Most people leave
erudin soon then go to qeynos and most people also leave qeynos pretty
soon heading east.

Not that I've seen. The level 54 was probably there doing the mind
numbingly boring task of trying to raise faction killing stuff.
