LOL The groups.google.com thing is at the root of your confusion. =P

A kill file is a tool that is possessed any decent news reader these
days; you probably don't have anything like it available if you're using
a web based service like Google. It allows you to automatically filter
posts by author, subject, etc. so that you never even have to see such
things as spam and mindless drivel from people whose opinions you
dislike. Basically, you add the offending subject/author to a special
file (details vary from software to software as to how you go about
doing that) and they disappear forever as far as you're concerned. 

The reason you sometimes don't see certain postings is because some news
servers are better than others. It's not uncommon for a post to be
dropped here and there; but others who use different servers may still
get that post and reply to it. Stop using Google. Check with your ISP
and get the name of their news feed; use it instead. If it continues to
happen often, complain to your ISP or switch services.

Dunno why you can't see Bizbee's posts; but it's probably related to the
answer to #2. He's a regular on this forum known for his, erm, outspoken
opinions, and he posts quite frequently. /grin
