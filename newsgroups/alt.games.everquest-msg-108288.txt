Being quite new to the game myself (11days realtime) I was wondering what
people think of rangers in groups. Im lv30 myself and i tend to solo most of
the time, but 40+ do we have a role?
Not wanting to start a flame contest, or anything i was just interested in
peoples views on rangers in groups.

Thanks for ya time.
