I can hear the Necros wailing in sympathy for you now. :-p

> No bind, 

You're not a caster. Bind is a spell. But VI already put soulbinders in
the game to stop all the whining. (Or some of it anyway.) If you mean
you should be able to bind *anywhere* then there would be no need for
casters as you could bind rush just about any mob in the game.

It's a spell. (see above.) However, you can get Thurg or regular gate
potions if you're willing to put in the time/money.

They're called "classes with heal spells". Group with, get to know them,
love them.

It's a spell. (You may be sensing a pattern here.)

Don't be silly. You're already a cleric pet.

Well, except for the rediculously nice and easy to get armor that drops
in Umbral, the centi weapons that drop like baby food, etc. etc. etc. 
And the AA stuff which, while fairly sucky, is as good or better than
most of the other classes farily sucky AA stuff.

/agree. The druids didn't get it much worse/better than anyone else.

Casters... soulbinders... see above.

What server are you on? You can't swing a dead frogloc without hitting a
warlord on ours.

It's called grouping. Try it. You'll love it.

Keep something in the bank for corpse runs. It's not hard. And you'll
usually be bound near a bank in your early levels.

Try the munster with that. It's sooooo much more tangey and zesty than
plain old cheddar!
