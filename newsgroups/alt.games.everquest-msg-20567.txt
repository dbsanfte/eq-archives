My my, you see me use "fascism" a lot in my posts? Funny, I seem to
have missed these "lots" of times I've used it. Anyone else wanna help
me find these times I've used the word, since they're apparently so
frequent...?

...if "damn" offends you, you are entirely too sensative. Most people
don't even consider the word anywhere near vulgar anymore. It even
makes its way past the prudes at the censor boards now days.

And here I was hoping you weren't just trolling, but a response this
idiotic can't possibly be anything BUT a troll. No further discussion
needed.
