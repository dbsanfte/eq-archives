Necro has definitely been Nerfed more than any other class.  Druids follow a
close second.   I'm surprized I haven't seen Bards mentioned here yet.  It
used to be that the low level AE mez song worked flawlessly and could keep a
whole group of mobs parked while your group picked them off 1 by 1.  This
was nerfed a while ago, and the song is now for the most part, worthless.
The resists are now too numerous to be useful, and the hate factor
associated with it means that any bard who sings it, will soon be at his
bind point.  The Bard Charm line has been nerfed also.  They raised the mana
cost on the level 39 Charm, and they made it so that a recharmed mob will no
longer get back to attacking its previous target.  The whole introduction of
secondary resists blew too.  Bards have had more than thier fair share of
Nerfs.
