Yeah, I've seen it. Trying to buy the item after the random other slot
goes empty results in a "You can only have one of these items" messages.
Left me scratching my head quite a few times till I figured it out.
"Since when did ruined cat pelts become LORE?" It's especially puzzling

I /bugged it but didn't reinstall, and at any rate, since I haven't done
a lot of merchant surfing lately, I haven't been encountering it much, so
it's dropped below my radar, so to speak.
