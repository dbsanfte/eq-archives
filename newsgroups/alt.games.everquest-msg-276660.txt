Extra content is entirely different to what is being proposed. What is on
offer is better gear etc when you make a payment. The example given by them
was in a racing game, the person paying the most gets the best car, not to
see different tracks.

this is a different issue and in most cases that already exists.

The danger is that it would be very tempting for designers to give people
'incentives' to use the payment system. The example of the racing car that
they gave in the article translates into gear in MMOGs, such as armor or
weaponry. If for example, to get an 'epic', on must solo Blarg the Wondrous,
then people who simply play the game might find the encounter impossible.
The 'Princes' who come from real life wealthy backgrounds will lord it over
the 'peons' who work in game for what they get. If  the base cost of the
game is often all you are going to be able to afford, do you really want
some Saudi prince to be able to buy their way into the top levels of the
game? Would you like it if it was between you and that prince as to who
could join a group, and they pick the prince because his gear is better than
you would ever be able to earn?

This would break immersion for most games. The recent debacle about /pizza
in EQ2 is an example of how people despise this sort of link. You are
already paying for the game. To pay and still have to watch irrelevant
advertising is maddening and one of the reasons people buy DVDs rather than
watch movies. I think the introduction of inappropriate advertising would
increase interest in other games. They are big now, but something like this
could destabilise what is quite a fragile market. Something else will appear
to fill the void and we won't have any idea what it is. Maybe virtual
reality where you physically interact with the environment with force
feedback or maybe something we can't even conceive of.

Already is. Some games are banned in australia. If someone did a MMOG of
GTA, i expect it would be banned straight away.

This is the first time I've seen this matter raised and i doubt highly many
people would see any relationship. Orc rights now? Goblins unfairly depicted
in LOTR? Sauron sues for defamation?

Or just ludicrous full stop.
