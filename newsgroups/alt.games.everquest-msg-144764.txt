You say "diety."  I wonder, then, if it's not possible for that diety to be
taken as the Christian God...  I know it's common to refer to the Lord and
Lady, but it would be interesting to see if Judeo-Christianity and Wicca are
compatible (once Pat Robertson is removed from the discussion).  IIRC, the
emphasis is on a Goddess... is that a particularly feminist thing, or is it
common across all of Wicca (ie, based on nature being seen as a mother)?

Hmm, where I had thought them to not be serious about their religion, it
seems they are simply trying to counter the worst of the misinformation.

I can think of worst things to consider the best hour of the day.
