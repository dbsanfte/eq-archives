 The pathing is very bad in some areas. Most people don't see it since
they are sitting waiting on mobs to show up, but the pullers see it. I'd
say it almost makes a FD puller required for single-group XP if you're
going to be camping one of the tombs. Mobs within the same room don't
have a problem, it's just when you want to get them into other rooms
that things get funky.

 Not sure where that would be. Unless it's near the Temple of Marr
portal with all the named guards. I don't really recall any flurry mobs
there. Nor rampage, either. Not inconceivable that they aren't in there
somewhere though.

 Yeah, they didn't seem weakling to me. They are at least as tough as
the average PoV mob.

 Exactly. I actually think PoV is better XP. Expecially the Razorfiend
caves. It's just more noticeable because most guilds in Halls of Honor
are there by themselves so there's never a shortage of mobs to pull.
