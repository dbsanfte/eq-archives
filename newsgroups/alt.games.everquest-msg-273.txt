The rule is simple -- you have the effect of ONE haste item and ONE haste 
spell. Anything that displays in your buff window (like proc of the exe 
axe) is considered a spell. If you have 2 haste items, the best haste is 
used. The only way you can have 2 haste spells, is to have a 
shaman/chanter spell and bard song. In this case, the haste component of 
the bard song will not add.
