I've weaned myself from this habit, although it was
satisfying to get congratulations from people I
had grouped with in the past who happened to be
in the same zone with me.  Now though, I get complaints
from time to time from same..."hey man, you leveled,
why didn't you ding!"

If you are steadfastly not a twink, you have I think
a certain liscense to mock others equipment.  This
only applies to first characters, though, as knowledge
of how everything works is the ultimate form of
twinkage.  Everyone on Firiona Vie is a twink.

Yes, I agree, its odd, but the words exist solely for
politeness, and yet people abbreviate them, thus
obviating the politeness factor.

Spam is a good way to get on my ignore list... and
you -don't- want to be on clerical ignore lists.

Except in S Ro on the AC, where all gloves are
off.  Then again, 6a) don't camp the AC in
S Ro, as you will either have the kill stolen, or
be forced to violate your ethics and steal someone
else's kill.  Go to OOT like an adult.

I disagree here, unless you put heavy emphasis on the
word constantly.  I don't mind helping out strangers
by replying with the address of a spot I'm familiar with,
think it helps create a sense of community.  On the
other hand, I expect to tell them once and once only,
and I don't expect to give them three or four more
adresses in the zone in the next few minutes.

While I appreciate the thought, really having one cleric
pissed off at you isn't likely to be all that crippling.
You need to avoid making a habit of pissing off people,
thats true, but one swallow doesn't make a summer,
and one cleric isn't going to keep you from getting
resed most of the time.

This is Verant's fault, for giving the "x is inspecting
you" message in the first place.  Sensible people
disable that message so they aren't bothered by
people who simply don't know any better.  But
its still excellent advice, since the people that
object most to being inspected unasked are the
same ones that aren't sensible enough to disable
the message.  Emotions and sense rarely mix in
a case like this.

I have no problem with Gandalph, although it
is a violation of the Naming Policy.  At least its
an effort to pick a name from a fantasy/medieval
background.

Demanding is right out, but asking for SOW in
open channel doesn't seem like too much of a
crime.  After all, any sensible druid, shaman,
or ranger seems to keep it constantly memmed,
and it costs very little mana once you've leveled
up a bit.  It makes such an enormous difference
in the game that I'm happy to hand it out if its
convenient.  I don't like to be put on the spot with
a /tell about it, though, if its not convenient, well,
thats my call, and the lack of an answer to a general
call should be sufficient.
