I'm just courious about what you mean by "Scripted 'Bots". I can't imagine
playing 6 characters at once, even though I've seen pictures of EQ setups
for just this. Is it just a paper script with the sequence of hot keys to
press, or is there some way to automate a character with some kind of
programing script?

I do occasionally 2-box, and have some hotkeys set up that help. Controlling
2 characters at once is tough enough when the shit hits the fan.

Not that I have the means or desire to try to run 6 characters at once, just
wondering how it could even possibly be done. /boggle
