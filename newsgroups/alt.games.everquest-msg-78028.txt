Think it's just easier to get killed and get the food for being a low
level. Used a lot of my hard earned money for food, not worth it at
this point. Got lost badly in Qeynos, got a better map now. I thought
bread was common? Sheeeze. Ended up buying grapes. Also bought some
mead, only to find out it doesn't do shit to quench the thirst. Ah
well live and learn.

Might figure this out if I can get back to leveling and stop screwing
around with food ;-)

I think I might have a clue on this one as well. Seems the books are
for advanced things, I think. Looks like I'm stuck with my picks.
