The thing I do when I hit slumps is Tradeskills. Clerics make great Smiths
with high Wis. and the ability to Imbue at least one gem for your cultural
armor.

Brewing and fishing are a great combo. Brew up a batch of whatever isn't
trivial to you, sit yourself down by a lake in an interesting zone, and see
what you catch while you drink yourself silly. Fishing is the one tradeskill
you can do while drunk. (In EQ and RL)

There are some great tradeskill quests, like the shawl quests in Thrug.

Just my 2cp
