Thanks to everyone for all the answers. I think I'll go for
exactly these two. I actually also need a perma EB item as
well, so thanks for mentioning it :) I can solo the WW goblin
fort with ease at level 55 ... what does it drop off? Only
the grachnist? If so. hourlong killing of everything in that
fort should pop him sometime not? Even if he's up somewhere
else in WW. I heard several grachnist can be up at all times.
I have no tracker to look for him elsewhere...
