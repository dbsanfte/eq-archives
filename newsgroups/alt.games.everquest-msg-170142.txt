I guess it's just unfortunate for you that you don't get as much
enjoyment out of the lower levels as you do the upper. I suppose I can
see how some people may see it that way. Different people find
different aspects of the game mroe entertaining than others. There are
those who really get off on having taken down certain uber mobs often
enough to become an authority on it, analyzing every aspect and
debating technique and methodology relating to the encounter. More
power to them. I may even ask their advice on occasion. However,
making a science of it and trying to achieve ultimate efficiency is
not job one in my mind. Having fun and still managing to kill the mob
without too many people dying is more important.

Having my highest level being upper thirties, I have enjoyed all level
periods so far and don't see any reason I won't also enjoy the higher
levels when I get there, as long as it's not reduced to a production
line raiding atmosphere. *That* would detract from it as far as I'm
concerned. The fact that I will have helped take down uber mob X or
will have done it z number of times won't mean much to me. The time I
have doing it will.
