I'm not going to argue that EQ has less downtime (when soloing at least)
than DAoC, that would be ridiculous. But please to god, stop claiming that
regen rates in EQ are static, because they aren't. I'm not talking about
mend, cannibalize, lich form, clarity, bard song, fungi tunics, or anything
else...REGEN RATES OF HITPOINTS AND MANA ARE NOT STATIC 
THROUGH THE LIFE OF THE CHARACTER. PERIOD.

No. Scales is:
Level 1, 50 hitpoints, regen 10 hitpoints per second
Level 50, 5000 hitpoints, regen 1000 hitpoints per second.

Goes up is:
Level 1, 50 hitpoints, regen 10 hitpoints per second
Level 50, 5000 hitpoints, regen 90 hitpoints per second.

Your view of everquest is:
Level 1, 50 hitpoints, regen 1 hitpoint per second
Level 50, 5000 hitpoints, regen 1 hitpoint per second.

And I can go from post-rez to full hp/full mana in about 4 minutes with my
shaman. Less if there is a cleric to throw heals, and considerably less if
I ever get a copy of Torpor.

Here is the thing tho...I go OOM roughly once every 2-3 months. Seriously.
I don't really care how long it takes me to go from empty to full, because
that information is unimportant to how I play the game. Dandy that it takes
your bard 1:35 to go from empty to full...well, it takes me about the same
amount (probably less) to go from last-fight to ready-for-next-fight when
soloing in EQ...so where is your advantage?
