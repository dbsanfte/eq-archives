I'm using OE right now, and the easiest way IMHO is to open up one of the
idiot's messages, then go to Message -> Block Sender.  That will block based
on email ID.

If the poster is using multiple IDs, you'll have to block each one separately,
but if they're using just multiple munges, such as:

imanidiot@nospam.com
imanidiot@nospam.com.com
imanidiot@msn.nospam.com

etc., then block one of them, go into Tools -> Message Rules -> Blocked
Senders List, select the address that you just blocked, and click "Modify".
Change the entry so it looks like:  imanidiot* (the * will match everything),
save it, then make sure the checkmark is in the News column.
