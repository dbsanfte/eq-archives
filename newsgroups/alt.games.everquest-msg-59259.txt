I would like to go back to LGuk and camp the ghoul lord. He's often
camped, however, but there are other good camps down there for items or
xp, so it's no big deal. However, getting down there can often be a
pain. As a troll, I was born KOS to the live froggies, and have killed
hundreds, if not thousands, since then. The trip down is either futzing
around with trying to be invis, or fighting some army of greens that
want to swarm me. This got me to wondering.... do you get some sort of
*huge* faction bump with the live frogs for helping kill the frog ghoul
lord in undead side? You know... similar to the huge bump with Knights
of Truth you get for helping to kill Lucan?
  I figure if that's the case, and I stop down there and find him
camped, could I just wait for him to spawn and pop an arrow into him
when the campers are fighting him? Getting non-KOS to the live frogs
would be a nice, convenient plus to my travels. But I'm also wondering
if trolls are limited to some maximum best possible faction with live
frogs so I'll *always* be KOS?
  Any of you tried this?
