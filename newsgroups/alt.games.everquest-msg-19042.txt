Well, I don't actually care whether you 'think so' or not, since you
don't actually know, do you? I was quoting from the official naming
policies, which I will now bother to dig out:

From http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp

Conditions for Surname Changes:
 
The player is level 20+ and...

* Either the surname, or the combination of the first name and surname
violate the Naming Policy.

* Is getting married or divorced.

* Is entering or leaving a guild or family that shares a common surname.

* Doesn't have a surname yet, or wishes their current surname to contain
double capitals (e.g. McGregor, GaFennix, XacLevir).

* Doesn't have a surname yet, or wishes their current surname to contain
an accent ( ` ) (e.g. Ka`Trevx, Doli`k, Jan`frik).

* Doesn't have a surname yet and the surname they are trying to give
themselves is not being granted even though it does not violate the
Naming Policy.

* Surnames will not be modified for any other reason.
