There's a lot of discussion/complaints on the EQ techie forum about lag
issues. Prior to LDoN I suddenly had horrendous problems with it. I couldn't
sit or remain motionless else I would be LD within a couple of minutes. In
fact I ended up playing my warrior just so I could get a decent gaming
session. Anyway I found the EQ techie board and looked over the posts and
one made reference to this patch
ftp://ftp.eenet.ee/win/Drivers/VIA/vlatency_v020_beta4_057301.zip for
GeForce cards. I installed it and the lag problem disappeared immediately
after I restarted the game!

Now the bad news - when LDoN came out it was as though  that patch wasn't
installed and I am back to square one again. The only reason I posted it is
that it may offer a solution for anyone else. Saying that the AB server has
just come down for a short patch so SoE may hopefully have resolved it.
We'll have to see.

Just for the record - my specs:
 Windows 2k
 Athlon 1800
 512MB DDR RAM
 Geforce 4MX 440
 Creative SB Live! 5.1 Digital Sound card
 512kbps DSL
 I run at 1024x768 with 16bit color.
