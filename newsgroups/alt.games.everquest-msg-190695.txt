You didn't say the level of your warrior, so what I am suggesting may
be something you'd have to buy instead of hunt for.
 
Jagged Chodikai Spine -- piercing weapon that drops in Chardok - light
source
Silvery 2-handed Axe -- 2H Slash that drops in Permafrot - Infravision
Glowing Velium Axe -- 2H Slash from Kael - lightsource
Globe of the Everburning Flame -- Range slot +2 vs Cold - lightsource

Check the bazaar using the filter "light" for more.
