Your numbers illustrate my point even better than the ones I proposed.  Ok,
so 1200 hp divided by 120 damage per second equals 10 seconds before an
unaided chanter dies (I'd given him 6 in my previous post).  If you cast
Celestial Healing, as I do, when the chanter mezes or when the puller
announces 'Incoming', the chanter should get healed for more than 300 hp
over those 10 seconds which makes for at least 2 more seconds of life (we're
up to 12 now).

Am I to think that during those 12 seconds, there is nothing the cleric (or
anyone else for that matter) can do?  I figure there is more than enough
time to stun, root and cast Superior Healing (583 hp)...  After which you
can re-root or stun again if neither of them stuck in the first place (not
to mention that the cleric's three casts will probably shift aggro on to
him -- Stun is a real hate builder).  Darn, to add to your aggro factor, you
could even engage the mob to save the chanter!

I always cast Celestial Healing on the puller/tank before he leaves and cast
on the chanter as soon as the mob is pulled to camp (especially so when
doing Captain since random pops happen all the time). Therefore, Cel healing
should be finished casting on chanter at about the same time he finishes
mezing (and moves to the top of the hate list if/when it's resisted).  If
mez is resisted, the cleric has tons of time to stun, to root *and* cast Sup
Heal.

LOL  I always keep the chanter in view because, you say so yourself, if a
cleric waits for the health bar to start fading before doing anything, it
might be too late..  Ok but, for arguments sake, let's say that you're right
and that healing an aggroed chanter is useless and a waste of mana.  Is
there anything else you can do? Yes there is, and plenty!  But it implies a
heads-up approch and keeping an eye on a very fragile and *very* important
member of your group.

In Captain, casters usually each stick to the corners at the top of the
stairs and to the right (I prefer facing the casters and positioning myself
to the left of the stairs and across the hall between the two entrances)

Then root the mob or stun it!  Then you can use a low-level heal to fill out
the health bar (Cel H should still be up, remember).  The chanter should
also be able to help himself a tad if you can give him a window of a few
seconds

My point is that if you are so sure that healing a chanter is useless, then
it's even more important that you always be ready to take the root-stun
approach and heal later.  Heck, even anything from the Calm, Soothe and
Atone line of spells would be useful.  Or even a DD wallop.

I just don't buy the fact that chanters are as good as dead the minute the
Captain aggroes them.  I'd even go as far as guaranteeing a chanter in my
group at least a 90% chance of making it if the Captain popped on his head
and attacked him while the group was totally involved with a few other mobs.

But then, that may be because I play my cleric differently.
