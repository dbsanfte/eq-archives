I used to go to a Necro website.  I -thought- it was:

http://necros.eqclasses.com

It had a ton of guides, information, etc on playing a Necro.  Now, it just 
goes to a discussion area at:

http://necro.eqclasses.com  ( no 's' ).

Does anyone know the real address to get back to the necro site that isn't 
the discussion board?  The background was black and it had a bunch of 
"magikal" symbols down the left side of the page.  Great description, huh?
