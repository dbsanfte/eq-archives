BB is in the same zone as a pok book (a minor factor for those who run 
to pok between every adventure to beg for buffs), BB is dead friggen 
simple to pull, BB is wide open, easy to pull (trivial for pull 
classes), features few rooms with many adds, features enough undead to 
be a little easier on that score, it has few complete healers, few 
wizards, and few mobs that HT, few casters in general really. Its 
probably the easiest one.

SRo on the other hand is full of CH mobs, Wizard mobs, and several large 
fairly densely packed rooms with difficult to see mobs.

Lately I've been doing 3-man ldons with a 55 sk, clr, and enc. Its a 
nice challenge. The disparity in casters in guk vs mistmoore is 
significant enough that the enchanter can easily maintain mana with just 
C2 and mana taps in guk, but is noticeably more mana starved in 
mistmoore. (Running tribute and still having low mana issues.)

As for targeting in guk. That seems to be fixed. I occasionally still 
use the cycle targets key, but usually mouse clicking works.
