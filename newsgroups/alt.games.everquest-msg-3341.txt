PvP (Rallos Zek server) -- You can fight anyone within 4 levels of
you, no matter what race.

PvP-teams (Tallon and Vallon Zek) -- YOu can fight anyone that's not
on your team and is within 8 levels of you.  The teams are:

Human-types (Human, Erudite, Barbarian)
Elves (Half-elf, Wood elf, High elf)
Shorties (Dwarves, Gnomes, Halflings)
Dark races (Dark elves, Trolls, Ogres, Iksar)
