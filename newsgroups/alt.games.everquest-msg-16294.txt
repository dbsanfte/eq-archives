Hmmmm, now this does add some neat potential here.  All that's left of the
SK/necro discussion (I'd say) is the necro's higher mana regen vs. the SK's
damage output.......no, I'd still say Necro.  SK's would make the mob drop
faster but that'd mean he/she'd have to cast even more.  Him sitting would
mean down time.
