Alright, I thought I'd poll the general group here, as there seems to
be a fairly informed bunch of EQ players here.

At whatpoint would you kick a group member from a LDoN group, and at
what point would you just give up completely?  I'm asking as an
occiasional group leader here, where do you draw the line?

I'll give you a couple examples of people who gave made my 'do not
group with' list recently.  I've had people go afk for extended
periods of time, I've had one person go on afk and put himself on
auto-follow with one of the other players, and I've had people
repoeatedly not listen to directions (stop pulling for a fricking
second , DO NOT touch the crate, etc.)

Now, In all these cases, it has ended up in a failed dungeon.  Also,
due to the timed nature, and inablility to replace said morons once
you've accepted, I've been loathe to turf them.  Soldier on and see if
they smarten up.

But I think I've turned the corner and am about to become a
no-nonsense hardass about these dungeons.  I think I'd rather take the
mission failure than the wipe, or the possibilituy of failure than the
idiot who runs down the wrong corridor and agro's six more mobs on the
group.

Basically, do I want ot be the nice guy, or do I want to be known as
the 'no-bullshit tolerated guy'.  My loot splits are fair, and I
haven't had any problems with my successes, but seeing as my main is
37, I don't have  a lot of LDoN options if I get blacklisted here, as
some of these fools will likely be close in level for a while.

Any thoughts, a.g.e??
