    As you are aware, this does not mean the work is not copyrighted.  (Rip
the covers and title page off a copy of Chichton's latest, it's still
his/his publisher's).
    All it means is that the copy on your computer does not have that
information on it.  Which means (barring an assertion by you that you wrote
it, which you didn't make) that the onus would be on you to prove that the
work is in the public domain, or that the copyright is truely untracible.
    Since there are numerous references within the document to a currently
operating agency (SOE) including contact information, it is clear that it is
an internal corporate document and therefore (barring other, refuting,
information) obviously copyrighted to Sony.  Though it could be a fake
designed to look like the real thing, in which case the copyright would
belong to the person generating the fake, and not to Sony (but to find that
out, Sony would probably have to deny the document).
    In fact, you proported this as fact, by stating that you believed it to
be the SOE manual for the EQ Guide program.
    Since you further implied sufficient experience that you should
reasonably be aware that copyright information does not have to be present
to be true, we can deduce the following:

    As far as you know it is a copyrighted document.

    Not so I saw, (see above about SOE), but there are several people named,
that could be (or at least be safely considered as) contributers, since they
are named, specifically, as having official capacity within the agency the
document describes.

    Probably safer for you to have said that, rather than admit that you
have reason to suspect that the document might not of been free for you to
distribute.  (From a liability point of view).

    The copyright issue was not really the main point of my post, though
since it seems to be your defense, I ultimately suggest that it is probably
a very safe assumtion that this (assuming it is genuine) is a copyrighted
document. If it isn't genuine, then it is definitely a copyrighted document,
but the author is probably unwilling to take credit, in which case you are
probably safe.
    The document itself may not be legal for you to posses.  How you got it,
may be illegal. And, in either case it is probably not legal for you to
distribute.  Your assertion that it seems to posses no copyright information
is simply not a viable defense.
