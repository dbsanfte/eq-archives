    The encounters are built around people having CH. It would be more
correct to say, "Every high-end encounter in the game is geared towards
having clerics as healers." Druids sure don't suffer as healers in the
lower-end game, although you DO spend most of your play time eventually at
the high end.

    I've seen raids called because we didn't have enough clerics or shamans
(in terms of priest classes). So druids need tuning to do something useful
and unique, as they are the odd class out. At this point in time they don't,
and that's why they aren't a needed raid class. Circle of Seasons, PotC and
the fire debuff just aren't required enough. I'd love to see druids get a
group HoT spell - that would be useful.

    All a druid is good for is SoW? Thank you for telling me - I'll be sure
to give all my characters SoW potions and never group with the beggars
again! And here I thought that when my monk duo'ed with a druid that the
damage shields, snares, HP buffs, regen, near-irresistable DoT on the mob
and top-up heals were helping me! =/

    Clerics heal. It's what they do. It's pretty much all they do - heal,
buff HP/AC, and nuke. If they weren't the best healers, would you really
want to group with one over some other healer? Can they solo very well if
they aren't getting groups? Would it make you feel better if, instead of
"Greater Healing", the cleric version was called "Heal of Faith" or some
other stupid name and healed 15% more than your Greater Healing?

    And that 15% bonus shows up other places, just to antagonize you more.
There's pods that drop during the caller quest in Fungus Grove that have one
charge of "Fungal Restoration" - 90 HP heal. When my cleric uses one,
however, my cleric 15% inherent bonus and my AA ability both kick in and I
get 107 HPs of healing. =)
