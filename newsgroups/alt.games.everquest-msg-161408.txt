Intended. The only thing you cannot do is stack multiple pre50 fire
dots and multiple post50 fire dots. You can stack immolate and breath
of Ro (always could), but not flame lick and immolate (just for the
example :) ), and you can't have 10 druids all cast BoR on a target;
you can only have a debuff on a target once so only one spell will
stick.
