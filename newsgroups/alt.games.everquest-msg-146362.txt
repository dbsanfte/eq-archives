Actually warrior was used to be considered a better damage dealer than a 
cleric. Of course, a monk or rogue are better, but not always available. 
Used to be, a paladin or an SK would be acceptable for that role.

Hmm, I didn't look at it from that perspective. I looked at it from 
perspective of "now you have no reason to have a second warrior, since 
second cleric will do more damage and provide a healing safety net too"

Most groups don't need to go after tougher mobs. As soon as a group can 
take non-stop stream of blues, adding people only reduces experience.
Unless, of course, they are friends, etc. But in 90% of cases that I've 
seen people go for efficiency over enjoyment

Actually I'll have to try that, I'm not positive. Say, killing an even 
mob takes at least twice longer than killing a low blue. And it gives 
about 60% more experience than that same low blue. So it's still less 
experience, and more danger (which is fun for some, and not fun for 
others).
