I did the quest back before it got nerfed, when there were about five spawn
points for the skellies. The hilts dropped like leaves (well, almost.) If I made
the round killing them all, then starting over on a second round, I don't think
there was once that I could kill ten of them without getting a hilt to drop.
  Now the number of skells has been reduced. (one? two?) and I believe the drop
rate as well.  While hunting elementals last weekend for smithing components, I
got attacked by, and killed, easily a half dozen of them and I never saw a hilt.
So yes, Virginia, I think it's a rare(r) drop now.
