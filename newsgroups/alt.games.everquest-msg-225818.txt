Mage pets often make decent tanks especially with Focus and HoV, I had
'Dogdog' tank pre slowed PoV outer mobs for 15 minutes while I waited
for the rest of the group to arrive.  Three or four casts of Torpor
and three or four casts of Kraggs was all he needed per mob. <cough>

Had to wait until they were slowed before sending him in of course or
he'd tend to explode on contact..
