Field of Bone or LoIO in Kunark is easy money too... and closer to home.
But paineel is a nice change of scenery, and every newbie should run the 
warrens at least once.

Not much reason to worry about Erudin as a Necro. Now that the books and 
teleporters are in tox forest.

Luclin and PoP nullify that. The reason most of the old world towns are 
empty is because you can get pretty much everything you need either in 
your hometown or on Luclin so factioning for evil races has become 
pretty moot.

Shopping the bazaar will get you better stuff for the effort... but 
farming cash is far far duller than questing. Some people balance the 
two activities... some people just farm cash... and some people just 
quest... its up to you.
