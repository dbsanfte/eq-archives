Hello all!  I play a 38 bard on Bristlebane.  I have two questions about
instrument skills (plus a bonus!).  I've been lurking here for a while and have
scanned EQDiva and have not found the answers.  

1. Which stat governs skill raises?  Is it Int/Wis?  Dex?  Cha?  I know it's
Int/Wis for most casting and tradeskills and then Dex (weapons), Agi (defense)
and Str (offense) for assorted melee skills.  However, it's not obvious what it
is for my instrument skills.  Most of my skills (except singing) are lagging in
the 160's instead of near my level cap (195), and I want to know which stat
would help them along.  

2. What is the use of high instrument skills, or casting skills generally? 
I've noticed on other characters (e.g. a level 9 ranger) that low skills tend
to fizzle.  A lot.  If I have a high skill, do I just avoid fizzling, or is
there some other benefit?

3. An added bonus question! :)  Is there a known fudge factor between level and
resists?  I notice that, all else being equal, I'm practically immune to spells
from mobs many levels below me.  It seems levels > all for spell resists.  How
much do I need to pump my resists to "look" a level higher, or to matter?  I
ask because I try to sing the most appropriate DS song to whatever I'm facing
(e.g. poison, disease, etc.) and wonder if the bump of 20-ish to resists really
matters.  I'd still sing it for the DS, don't get me wrong. :)  I just wonder
at what point it's worth moving over to the pure resist songs for the bigger
boost, or to nearly guarantee immunity, if possible.  

Thank you!  This place has been a great source of wisdom to me as I've been
lurking here for several months.
