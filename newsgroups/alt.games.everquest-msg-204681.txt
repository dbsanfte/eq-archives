They only guarantee keeping the characters for three months. But
that doesn't mean they do delete them when that time expires. I
have heard it said that they have never deleted a character, although
you also hear people claiming to have logged on and found their
character absent. I suspect there's a strong chance your characters
will still be there when you return.

The recent prexus rollback proved they even keep deleted characters
in some form. All my old experiments re-appeared after that.
