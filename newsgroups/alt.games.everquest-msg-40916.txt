I've been camping xxorbb for 2 weeks, about 60 playing hours, for the
goblin alchemist.  I was there for 18 of his spawns on Saturday, 12 on
Sunday, 8 yesterday, 2 this morning.  He has NEVER spawned in any of
that time.  Has anyone seen him (on Xev server), know if there's
something special that you need to do to get him to pop, or if he's
broken?

I've petitioned, feedbacked, emailed, cried, slept, etc...while
waiting for him, all to no avail.  Any help will be appreciated!
