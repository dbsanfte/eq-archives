I would imagine that they do believe it makes them right.  In the end, you
have faith that there is a universal concept of evil.  Others do not.  There
is no way to prove or disprove it.  Lokari appears to believe that there is
no such a universal concept.  I don't see any way to persuade either one of
you that you are wrong, as I see no way to prove either side of the issue.
I have my beliefs as to which one is correct, but I accept the fact that I
could be wrong.
