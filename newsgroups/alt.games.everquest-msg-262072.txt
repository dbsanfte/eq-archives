One way that might help here (I used it to max faction with my iksar) is to
group with someone who's very low level and who has nothing to lose by
dying, and preferably who can fear a mob (not necessary but nice). Then bind
them just outside.Once in, if buffed and sowed, they should be able to make
quite a train either by just running about or by fearing in the right place
(can't recall where i did it, but i do recall half of crushbone suddenly
charging at me). Use your many pbaoe spells to destroy them utterly. Share
the loot; newbie gets belt/pads, you get scalps, everyone's happy!

I recall using my wood elf druid loaded with hp gear but most newbies are
ridiculously twinked anyhoo and perhaps you can just ask a friend if they'd
like to start an alt. The lower the level, the bigger the train but the hard
it is to stay alive long enough for pbaeo to wipe them. Still death is
nothing but a gate just outside, so just rezone and the loot is there.

CB was abandoned when i got there and exept for some areas i think i pretty
much depopulated it this way. Obviously around the slavers you have to be
careful as the slaves can join in and give you nasty faction hits; took a
bite out of my gem choppers once i think, had to kill a few minotaurs to
make up for it.

Oh well, I've decided to leave my epic until later because epic 2.0 mobs are
in hte same area (lake rathe) and i really don't want to have my corpse
camped by them. If you haven't done cleric epic, watch out.
