|Rangers.

	The only problem with Rangers these days is that Verant can't decide what
the hell the class is supposed to be.

	If we're supposed to be "light tanks" then our melee damage output is OK
but we need a 250 Defense like every other fighter class in the game and the
same HP boosts they get post-50.

	If we're supposed to be "damage dealers" like the Rogues, then we need
more melee damage output.  More than Warriors, less than Rogues and Monks.

	Right now, if we consider the game from the perspective of a commander
picking out a military force, there's never a reason to use a Ranger.
Warriors deal more damage and have better defense; use them instead.
