Now we all see why we didn't miss you

Remington was teasing you about the fact that *YOUR* headers
are wrong.  Not ours, not our comprehension of the implications
of the international dateline, but *YOUR* headers.

"Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2004 16:39:51 -0800"

See the -0800?  that means PST.  Since it is now 06:15 PST,
your headers are saying you posted from 10 hours in the future.

Well, one nice thing about your return, the flames you've so
justly earned with this post will distract attention from poor
hapless @ndrew.
