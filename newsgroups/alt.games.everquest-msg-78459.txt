Wow. Astonishing ignorance. You simply do not know what you are talking
about. It is by no means safer to snare individually. It is in fact much
more difficult for a Wizard to do things this way not to mention slower. Why
do things at Druid speed when you can do them at Wizard speed?

Most Wizards don't opt to double up with anyone when they quad kite. Bah,
you clearly don't know enough about these things to be worth arguing with.
