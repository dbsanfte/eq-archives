Been toying with the idea of camping it for a shot at a Solists, which is
why I was thinking about it. Might be worth it for the cleric to wander
around in Kurns for that possibility alone Close to LoIO too, so good
place to go solo if the groups in LoIO are too pathetic to risk your EXP
with. Happens a lot, one moron in a group can really make things tough
for the clerics and us Enchanters...

 /g ASSIST on the primary damn it!
