If they stayed at $10 a month while other games are more, they would win by
default. They would get MORE new subscribers, and keep more of the players
they have already. If some kid wants to play EQ, and has to pay to play, and
used his / her allowance or paper route money to play EQ he / she may not
even get to play when they want. To me I can come up with 3 bucks a month. I
just don't want to bacuse I can play Counter strike, or Quake free still.
Its more that the patches are always messed up, they drop servers outta the
blue for emergency patches, and it takes hours to get a guide even, and then
90% of the time no one will help you anyway, they say "Its part of the game,
sorry" so we are payin' more and getting less, like meny others if there
were a substantial increese in the service they provide. Then maybe it would
be a little more justified, as things are now. I think the increese is to
much at one time. I could see $1 or $1.50. but they are just being greedy
now..
