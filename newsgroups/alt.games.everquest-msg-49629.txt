I probably have no business wandering about LOIO as I am
just a 15 druid.  I strolled around a large structure in the
Northeast corner of the zone, from where one may zone
to West Cabilis.  None of the guards seemed to mind my
being around.

Then I killed a Sarnak hatchling, for no good reason.  I am
now not welcome, as the guards killing me on site indicates.
I suppose I have to improve my faction with those guards.
My foolish killing of the hatchling resulted in the following.

My faction with SarnakCollective went down.
My faction with LegionOfCabilis went up.
My faction with BroodOfDiZok went down.

I've two questions.  First, is BroodOfDiZok the guards there?
Second, how do I raise my faction with whomever I must?  I
wonder what I'll be able to kill in my sadly naked state until
I can go loot my sorry corpse.

Thank you for you help, and I'll not wince too much when you
tell me I've been an bonehead.
