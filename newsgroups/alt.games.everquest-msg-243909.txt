The one thing I got upset about was the simple fact that someone jumped
in kicking assuming they were arguing with me. I wasn't there to argue.

Nope. Just offering various "for instances" for further discussion.

Again, with the debating crap. I'M NOT DEBATING!!!! You seem to *want*
very badly for me to be, BUT I'M NOT.

No retreat. No argument. I merely adjust the parameters for
reexamination. It's a civil process. You're trying to make it combative.

Maybe I'll run all topics by you for your approval beforehand in the
future. I've learned a lesson alright, though surely not the one you're
claiming to have taught.

Me too.

Surely you can wrap your mind around the concept of discussion without
debate. Honestly, if you refuse to hear me, I really don't know what
else to say.
