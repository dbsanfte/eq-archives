Luckily the people who run GOM aren't very bright.  The way they got scammed
is easy to avoid, but they've never put any work into doing so.

Or perchance I'm being hard on them and they're running on too tight a
margin to afford the method of protecting themselves.  Either way, I
certainly won't cry if they (and Yantis et al) are put out of business.
