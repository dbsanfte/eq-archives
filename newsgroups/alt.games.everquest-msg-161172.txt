Wasn't written by me.  In another group we had a huge discussion about
Flames and those who are true flame warriors.  Someone said that there are
two ways to flame.  One was to shot from the hip with a 6-shooter, getting
those not so innocent bystanders as well as the intended victim(s).  The
other way was to use a rapier and to be very particular with who you hit and
what you hit.  The problem is that by the time you make a hit, the other
person has blasted you (being your argument) full of holes.  I tend to use
both techniques rather effectively and simultaneously.  Hence the quote from
someone I cut down.
