Warrior and SK/Nec Guild are servants of Inny and you'd need to be a
worshipper of him to not be KoS with them.
Human, Agnostic Rogues are pretty safe in Neriak as are SK's (of different
Gods) but as you say, stay away from the Indigo Brotherhood.

They took their name from  the D Row that was signed on the first pics of
them. I believe D (David) Row was the creator as well as the artist of the
race of Dark Elves but I can't remember. Not sure if they were intentially
called Drow to start with or whether the name just stuck from the pics.

Agnostic you will be Dubious in human cities, the other races are less
tolerable of them, I am dubious to most of Erudin (except pallies) but no
hope in Halas.

I've been thinking recently of wrecking my Neriak Faction and getting non
KoS to Dwarves and Elves, has anyone else ever done this (Ooh a good Dark
Elf, there's a novel idea...wait I feel a franchise coming on) I am an ally
in Qeynos and High Pass (guards at least) Only the Halflings have a Druid
ring I am not safe at....hmmm may have to check out some faction tables.
