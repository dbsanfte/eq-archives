Hmm... so a game of cyclopses, titans, dragons, seraphim and archmages.
Interesting.  Of course there would be a lot of problems with it.   You
can't exactly take the gods of fantasy-type creatures, and send them out to
bash rats -> kobolds -> skeletons -> gnolls -> zombies.   You would have to
come up with something even more powerful than them to fight.  Perhaps start
them out on parties or raids of humans attempting to hunt them, then move on
into an alliance against all the demons of hell.

Also doesn't seem to leave much room for tradeskills.
