One of my guildies got the first new Ragefire spawn on EMarr. She was
just exping in SKyfire when it popped at 5 am one morning, and they
set about gathering people. While they were doing this, another guild
started porting in to get him. Thankfully, the new guild ended up
deciding to join forces with my guildie instead of making a huge row
about it.

She got her Chardok piece two nights ago, and we have our first cleric
with a stick :)
