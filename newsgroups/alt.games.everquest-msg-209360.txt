-Not sure what level the ravens are in PoTorment.  
-Ice burrowers in WW, but I think they are level 61, if not them,
several other animals in WW.

Can't think of anything beyond that other than the lower level animals
in the tier one zones.  PoD rats (they do hit for 250 or so), PoN
stalkers and ravens, PoJ rats?
