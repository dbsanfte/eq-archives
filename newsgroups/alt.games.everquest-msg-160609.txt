Some items now have 2 levels listed -
recommended (where you get all the stats)
and required.

An example is the Nightmare Compound Bow,
recommended level of 61, required of 46.

When a friend linked it to me, I was a bit
shocked to see reduced stats on something,
as I'd just hit 60.

I'd guess that they need to go back and
change flags on all existing items with
a required level to reflect the dual
flags.

Until they do, things will show recommended
level when it means required (like much of
the stuff from CT)
