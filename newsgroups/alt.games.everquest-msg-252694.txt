There are lots of fights where AE spells/rampage make melee less than
appealing.  If I could still put out 90% of my DPS from range, you can bet
I'd be standing at range and doing that for the whole fight on some of those
rather than being the monk that wasn't worth healing in melee range (and I
run a pocket cleric on raids, *still* often not worth healing on fights like
that).  =)

But since I top out at about 15 dps from range...
