The point I was making was that *no* movie retailer actually sells movies.

But that presupposes the courts recognize that playing EQ on your 
computer in your den is conducting business on someone elses property. 
Do we have a precedent for that? In any country?

Unless your referring to it as a TOS violation as part of the clickthru 
contract... and if that's the case the contract already stipulates the 
course of action SOE will take: banning your account. If I write a 
contract that says "You shall give me 5 gumballs by Monday; if you do 
not meet this obligation I will stop giving you access to my phone." A 
suit for breach of contract for punitive and/or other damages when you 
fail to show up with 5 gumballs will be upheld by the court... they'll 
rule that the contract already lays out what happens: no more phone 
access for the gumball guy, and simply suggest that I go ahead and stop 
letting you use my phone... (of course the terms of this contract are 
pretty trivial... and it would probably tossed on those grounds first... 
but the point remains)

Good point. Except that the problem is then ostensibly the 'plat farmer' 
and 'casino operator' and a solid argument can be made that these will 
exist, even without out of game plat sales.

ISPs are trying very hard to be idependant carriers, like telephone 
companies. And in my opinion at least that is their correct role. They 
should not be held responsible for what their subscribers do with the 
service. You can't sue AT&T for damages because a collection agency is 
phoning you more often than is legal...
