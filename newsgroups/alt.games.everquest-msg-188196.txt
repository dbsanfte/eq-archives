I believe that potions are the only items that disappear when they run out
of charges.  There may be a few others, but that's all I know of.  I got a
ball of yarn (several actually) thats only use is 4 charges of snare and
when you use the 4 charges it still says it has 1 charge but it stops
casting and doesn't poof.
