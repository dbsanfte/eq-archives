You need to learn more about how Usenet works.

When I make a post (like this one), it's initially stored on my ISP's news
server.  My ISP has a newsfeed arrangement with a couple of other places,
and eventually (usually within a few minutes) it propagates over to them,
and from them to whichever places they get a feed from, and so on and so on,
eventually reaching your local news server, where you can read it.  Because
of this, sometimes you will wind up seeing replies to a post before you see
the original one.

It's not like a web board or a BBS, where there is one central location for
everything.  Every server has a copy of every article listed.

But what happens to the old articles?  That depends on how the server is set
up.  Some groups, mainly high-activity ones, are set to delete everything
older than a week.  Some groups are set to delete things even earlier than
that.  Usually, things are kept around for a month or two, but it's all at
the discretion of whoever is running the server.

Also note that if a copy of the post is deleted off of one server, that has
no effect on the other servers.  That post will continue to exist on the
other servers until they delete their local copies.

As others have noted, nobody runs the place.  There is a set of guidelines
outlining how news servers behave and talk to each other, and other
guidelines about how to create groups, but it's all voluntary and done by
consensus.  The kicker is that if you don't follow the consensus, nobody is
obliged to propagate your articles, which tends to keep things on an even
keel.
