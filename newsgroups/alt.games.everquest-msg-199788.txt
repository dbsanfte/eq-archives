It sounds like you dont have any higher ups giving you gear - so I suggest
hunting the Beastlord in Everfrost until 4 or 5 then heading to blackburrow.

I say this because Vah Shir can do the Beastlord Newbie quests which give
you nice newbie armor the beastlord guild area is in the back of Halas just
hail the guy that isn't a merchant or a trainer - or you can jump start the
quest by handing in grey wolf pelts and he will tell you want the next step
is.
