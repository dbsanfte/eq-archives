First off who in the world lead you to believe Bards have time for Chat.
When you are twisting you may need to change instruments also. Here is what
I do 1st never carry more the 4 containers or bags. Drag the empty slot
locations to hot key spot 3 and 4 in hot key spot 2 put your secondary. Now
you can change instruments very quickly I have singing songs in spots 7 and
8 and instrument songs in 1, 5 and 6 with appropriate instrument next to
them. Now practice very little mouse movement easy changed instruments and
only 5 songs to Twist.
