There's a difference between doing what's right, and doing what's allowed.
I have worked the low end of CS (not for Verant or any other computer
company) and I agree 100% with everything Tweety says.  I make a terrible CS
person; my two biggest loathings are for stupidity and meanness, and CS work
dumps both on you by the truckload.  I think it's entirely right that morons
and assholes should receive a swift kick in the ass instead of the
preferential treatment to which they think they're entitled.  Unfortunately,
giving idiots their just desserts is so often illegal.  Sometimes my hand
still twitches at the thought of some particularly memorable asswipe whose
vacant skull I was not allowed to crush with the nearest convenient heavy
object.
