Not if you're not in any way worried about role-playing. Just read the
other posts on the places NOT to kill bears. Another one I would mention
is Jaggedpine Forest. Jaggedpine is a nice place for druids and rangers
to hunt griffons but if you kill bears there, you end up with lots of
aggros. I'm a 55 ranger and get squeamish about killing 'real' animals
(unless I can think of a really good reason why I need to :P ) so I
killed lots of hoppers in Shadeweaver's for their pelts and forgot
about the bear pelts.
