Kill BB Gnolls for teeth in BlackBurrow
Hand teeth to Capt Tillin in Sth Q hand Moonstoons to Mcneal in Fish Ales,
it's this part that gives Knights of Thunder and Priests of Life faction.

Killing the Necro in the WFP Sewers should also give you faction hits, she's
part of the Bloodsabres so is opposing faction.
