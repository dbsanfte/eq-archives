One thing than no one has mentioned is that the better cure spells remove
counters in waves, so to speak.  If you look at the Lucy data for Cure
Poison it will say:

Slot 1: Decrease poison counter by 1(L1) to 4(L12)

 So a level 1 cleric will remove 1 poison counter per cast, but after level
4 she will be removing 4 counters per cast.  Then look at the level 51
cleric spell Pure Blood:

Slot 1: Decrease poison counter by 9
Slot 2: Decrease poison counter by 9
Slot 3: Decrease disease counter by 9
Slot 4: Decrease disease counter by 9

The reason splitting up the removal of counters is a good thing, is that it
can allow the spell to cure more than one effect.  Say Jibober has 2 disease
dots cast on him, Infectious Cloud, which has 1 disease counter, and
Scourge, which has 4 disease counters, in that order.  If a cleric casts
counteract disease, which removes 8 disease counters in one slot, on Jibober
only Infectious Cloud is going to be cured.  The reasoning being that each
slot of a spell can only effect one detriment.  If the cleric were instead
to cast Pure Blood on Jibober, then the first decrease disease counter by 9
would remove Infectious Cloud and the second would remove Scourge.  Granted
the splitting up of counter removal is really only important if the target
has more that one detrimental effect on them, but it is useful information
none the less.
