Are there any Free Everquest Servers?  I just finished playing my
first MMORPG game, Ragnorak Online.  It was fun, but I would like to
try something that is more interactive and has more combat and such.
I would love to try Everquest for about 2 weeks, that seems like the
amount of time I need to really get into it.  Are there any free
servers for it that I can try it out on?
