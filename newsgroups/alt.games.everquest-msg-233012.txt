I know I am at the right spawn point......  I sing the Highsung and have a
lvl 65 at the spawn point at around p500 n4000.  Kill the mob... 13 mins
later a new one pops.  I have a been reading a lot of people having trouble
lately and I think it is because a lot less people are fighting in the zone.
By that I mean that might be his spawn point and we are killing the right
guy to get him to pop but there must be another trigger.....  Here I go
again though tonight.  Trying to get a few people to help me and we are
gonna kill everything around the GY while waiting for the 13 mins.  I will
keep you posted.  Also if anyone has anything more to add please put it in.
Thanks
