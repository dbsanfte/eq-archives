I found a similar card lying on the ground in Queynos hills. It's
nice to know it's part of a quest. What I also found amusing is
that, at least the card I found, was a magic the gathering reference.

The card being the `ebon lotus', which sounds a lot like the
`black lotus' which was one of the most desired cards in the
game.
