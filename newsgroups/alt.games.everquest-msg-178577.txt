When I was around lvl 25 to 30 I used to hunt in Loio sometimes, especially
if there was a saddle or sarnak fort group going.

I once met a chanter of the same lvl on the saddle who had over 100 charisma
more than me. Mez resists for him were less. I am Gnomer he was HE. I wonder
if there is a certain amount of cha that does affect Mezes. At the time I
had around 110 cha he had 200something.

Now at 60 and comparing resists to the other chanters in my guild I seem to
get resists slightly  more, and I have higher charisma, and they are HE's
and slightly lower lvl!. Now I'm thinking there is a racial bonus for
certain races or a negative one for Gnomers!!!
