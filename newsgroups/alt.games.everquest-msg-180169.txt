Yes dragoons suck.  Period the end.
I bound my druid right at the zone line between OT and FM.  Port out to
anywhere with a merchant to sell, then gate back.  
I kited the animals northeast along the mountain ridge towards Warslicks Woods.
 Watch out for other groups!! OH, and sarnaks.  At that level alot of my snares
didn't take on sarnaks, and some of them run at sow speed.   One berzerker in
particular outran my wolf form :(
