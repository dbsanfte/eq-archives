A while back EQ gave out free keys and gave a site to download the original
game.I downloaded the game and saved it on a CD and wrote the free key they
gave me on the CD. I was planning to give it to a friend but never did.Is
that key still good or do you think the canceled it after it wasn't used
right away?
