Were you LOM? If not, there were still things you could do to help:
root, stun, heal, etc. If you *were* LOM, did everyone get the "RUN!"
message? I often spam it several times before turning tail. Did
everyone else take off as well? If they did, I can't imagine you were
wrong for taking the safe way out.

Tough call really. Had you followed them out, maybe you could have
spot healed the tanks enough for the three of you to get out. However,
if your heals drew aggro, were they paying enough attention to you to
turn and pull the mobs off you? I doubt it. Like everyone else, they
were beating feet for the zone.

Were it me, I probably would have followed along and helped any way I
could. I can always cast DA if necessary. I can't say I would hold it
against you for gating though. They were running to save their skins,
you should be allowed to do so as well.
