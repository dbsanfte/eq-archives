Good idea!  Would you like to volunteer for this assignment?  I am sure 
many among us would be most pleased, if you did, with only a slight 
flamewar over whether any faq that was ever touched by Taras Bulbas in any 
way is good for more than firelighters.

}But I have been on usenet for years, and pretty much any group I read 
}posts a weekly faq/faq update/request for stuff to add to the faq.

Excellent observation!  This is, indeed, true!

}I can  honestly say that [just as a wild example] in the 8 years that I 
}have been on the Rialto [rec.org.sca] they have always posted the weekly 
}faq, 

Ahh, now you see, those other groups have something this group does not...
And that would be someone who is willing to remember to post the faq once 
a week and keep it updated, and/or figure out some way to automate the 
process.  Would you wish to volunteer for this duty?  Surely, the 
accolades will be many, and the flames much fewer!

}and there was never a autogenerated welcome posting telling me to go 
}read the faq...it just appears one a week=) 

Did you ever read newsgroups from an old unix system?  On the order of 
15 years ago?  A halcyon era, it was.  The FAQs did not say "do not 
post in HTML", for HTML had not been invented yet.  And MIME was a 
type of artist, loathed by most, but Multipart Internet Mail 
Extensions were a mere pipe dream, and not the scourge of text-only 
newsgroups they were to become.  

Pretty much all the newsreaders available in that day, the first time a 
user ran them, would auto-subscribe them to news.announce.newusers, 
news.answers, and possibly a couple more local groups.  Therein would be 
found wondrous posts, describing the marvels of reading the FAQ and arcana 
such as interspersed bottom posting.  Truly, it was a time of legend.  

But all such things must pass, of course.  Nowadays, when you mention a 
FAQ, way too many folks think you just misspelled something naughty.

}And I am perfectly happy  blaming Bill Gates and AOHell for everything, 
}including my husbands dandruff=)

Good on you.  Just don't blame SOE for anything, that always devolves into 
a relatively pointless flamewar. :)
