Yep there's all sorts of loonies.
I was with a group on the ledge in OT.  We had been there for a while
and had just pulled a sabertooth tiger.  Some wood elf female came
walking by obviously recovering from injuries and sits down right in
the middle of our current battle.  For whatever reason, the nice kitty
turned on her and killed her before we could taunt it away.  Was she
ever upset.  She was bound many zones away and blamed our group for
training her.  Who in their right mind would decide to med in the
middle of an active battle???  And then how do you get off blaming
that group for your death?
