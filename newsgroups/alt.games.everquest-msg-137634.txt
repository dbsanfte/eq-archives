We've done several, and just did it again last night. (*yawn* stupid
work night raids. Still behind on sleep.)

Nothing really much to say on that one other than the obvious. Have a
suitable sized force with plenty of melee. Get a VERY high level to pull
all of the Dark Elves. (Your chances for single pulls with a sixty are
better, though not assured. We had at least one double last night.)

Make sure the rogue does the turn-in and either get's out safely or has
somebody to drag him for a FAST rez while you pull the general.

General's a right bastage, but it's really more of a zerg fight if you
have the numbers and people keep their heads. We had 35 people last
night. Once we *finallY* got started, I'd say the whole thing was over
in about fifteen minutes and the general died in under thirty seconds.
Happy rogue. Tired raiders.
