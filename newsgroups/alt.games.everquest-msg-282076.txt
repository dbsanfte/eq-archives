I know that these are the same people who used to operate Winter's Roar. As 
a matter of fact, it looks like the exact same game with all WR references 
removed. Additionally, if you use the term "Winter's Roar" on their forums, 
it is automatically changed (for display purposes only - it still shows up 
in search results) to "Shards of Dalaya". "WR" is even changed to "SoD". 
Many links in the forum posts refer to other posts in the Winter's Roar 
forums which no longer exist.

I believe their policy is to not reference *any* external game sites to 
avoid any sort of backlash. I'm certain that SoE knows about them, but for 
whatever reason, they are able to operate as Shards of Dalaya where they 
couldn't under the previous name. It would be interesting to know the 
particulars.
