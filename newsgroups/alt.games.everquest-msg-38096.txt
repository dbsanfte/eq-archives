I used to work in media.  It is very easy for a reporter to get something
wrong by abbreviating it in his notes and then later going on memory while
he's typing back at the office.  Or, more commonly, for a know-nothing
editor to mess with the wording of a story he has no understanding of.

I can just envision some editor in a newsroom looking over the final rough
draft, saying, "What the hell is this 'Shadows of Luclin' crap?...no one's
gonna know what that is!.....'EverQuest2' is better...People know what a
'part 2' is.... fits into the copy better, too........"

Many editors specialize in dumbing down stories to the lowest common
denominator.  They say it appeals to the widest possible audience, which
means more money from advertising revenues.
