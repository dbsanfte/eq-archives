Was logging on with my account and clicking to get through the
annoying messages, and where they usually have the button to log on,
it was replaced with a "Preorder Now!".. so without thinking I
clicked, and realized it said PREORDER, now it says my order is
placed.

.. trouble is, I don't WANT it. Any way to get rid of it?
