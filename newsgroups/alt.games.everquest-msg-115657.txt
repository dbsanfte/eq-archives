You could also do both the "Ancient Pattern" and the "Platinum
Speckled Powder" chapters, both requires a lot of travel but no 
figthing.

From my own I never forget my exictment when I, at 33, was doing the 
"Platinum Speckled Powder" - the chase of the Human Skelleton, who runs 
at near SoW speed in and out between Giants, Monkeye's and Diggers 
(all Darkblue, yellow or Red) in FM and he don't stop before you
actually
have given him the Wood Painting and hit the 'Give' key. 
....at 33 we don't have Levi yet, and Camo breakes when interacting.... 
That hole 'session' really keept me 'on the egde of the chair' :-)
