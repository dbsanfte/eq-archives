The problem is, there wasn't a government warning, and the PM has been
called to question about that. So now, after the event, they have issued the
warning.

Indonesia, nepal, anywhere overseas is dangerous. I'd say there are few
countries as safe as australia. But that bomb blast was unprecedented for
that country, and may have well been organised to destabilise the government
by elements of the military still angry over australia's involvement in
Timor.

So it's big news, because it's not the Balinese as a group who are
dangerous, it's a group affiliated to Al-Quieda (sp?) which may have links
to a revolutionary element within the indonesian government, who care
nothing for the Balinese people and hate the western world with a vengeance.

And one balinese was airlifted, which is generous, and more may yet be.
Australia's resources in dealing with burns of this type were actually
tapped out; we ran out of the artificial skin that they use. This wasn't an
ordinary bombing, this was a calculated and intelligent attack by a group
with military level strategy, not some bunch of blood-crazed fanatics. One
bomb was used to crowd people together into another place, where the second
explosion was amplified by the use of gas cylinders... home made weapons of
mass destruction... just like those aircraft in america were.
