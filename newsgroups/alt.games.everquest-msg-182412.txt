This could be interesting, but what would it really accomplish?  I like
different zones for different reasons, and there are pleanty to see.  Now
special events would make it interesting, but fundamental zone changes can
make life awkward (Kithcor Forest for example).

I guess what I am thinking of are GM type events, which I think EQ needs
more of!
