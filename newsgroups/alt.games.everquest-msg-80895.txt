I greatly doubt it's a Verant bandwidth problem.  Sure, they need a TON of 
bandwidth, but Everquest is a VERY stable application in terms of 
bandwidth utilization.  It's not something that is prone to heavy peaks 
and then large lull periods.  It most likely almost exactly mimics the 
behaviour of general internet backbone traffic.  (Specific sites are 
usually very bursty, with huge spikes in the minute to minute or even 
second to second readings.  Backbone traffic measurements follow a very 
regular double sine-wave pattern.)  The very predictable bandwidth needs 
make it easy to monitor and predict when you're running out.

There is no way of knowing except for a pretty obvious lack of press 
release indicating ANY growth in subscriber base.  The Christmas season 
probably did lead to a number of new subscribers, but I haven't seen 
anything to indicate that it did anything more than replace those who have 
quit playing.  The entertainment industry lives on hype, and if EQ were to 
have a 10% increase in subscriber base, I think we would know it pretty 
quickly.  I just don't see any indication of that.

They have under-estimated bandwidth demands for the patch servers and the 
login servers, which have nothing to do with the game.  In fact there is 
absolutely no real reason to even have the patch server located in the 
same network as the live servers.

I understand what you're trying to do, and I'm hoping to find some clue as 
to the problem.  I don't think it's based on server utilization though, 
since I've been seeing the problem at weird hours.  (I recently completed 
my epic and as I got close I was regularly logging on at odd hours to 
check for spawns, kill mobs, do MQs, etc.)  I know that when they gave the 
server population numbers, the low-point at 6am or so was about 20% of the 
maximum server population.  I am seeing guildmembers disconnecting 
randomly, even at 6am.

I have no reason to think that /bug is ignored.  It all depends on how 
you report it.  If you do a /bug and say:

     Everyone is getting diconnected, you guys suck, you don't know 
     what you're doing, fix it now!

you probably won't see much action.  However if you do a /bug and say:

     I have noticed an increase in the number of disconnects.  I've 
     been logging the disconnects, and in a 6 person group we average
     9 disconnects an hour from 8-11pm.  From midnight until 3am we 
     only average 3 disconnects an hour.  I have kept logs of this, and
     will gladly send them if required.  In addition, I have been going
     LD several times a night, and I have been monitoring my connection
     to ensure that it's not general internet routing problems causing
     the LDs.  Every time I saw my packet-loss meter go into the red, I
     exectued a traceroute from a second computer on my network, and 
     the routes were stable.  I can also include these logs if you can
     use them.  I can be reached at eqtester@beta.com (which is the
     same email address registered with this account).

you would probably have a much greater chance of getting someone to take 
your report seriously.

I have submitted a /bug every time I have petitioned for a GM rez due to a 
bug (other than server crash, they generally are aware that it crashed).  
I figure that if it's enough of a bug that I'm asking for a GM rez, then 
it surely is enough of a bug to warrent a /bug submission.  I've had 
almost entirely positive interactions with the GMs, and received rezzes in 
every case where I died to a bug and /petitioned.

good thing we had 2 clerics in the group last night, lots of LD
