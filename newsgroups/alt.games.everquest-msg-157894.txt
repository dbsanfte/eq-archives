Oh HELL yes. :) After that whole "oops you forgot to register so let's
port your darkie ass under Kelethin for fun" incident, I got to the
PoK going "okay, where are they gonna send me *next*?"  It took me a
long time to find any vendors cause, well, I was afraid to click on
the pictures on the walls - I thought maybe you were supposed to guess
which picture was for what city, so I ran further and further inside
the city and suddenly heard a vendor saying "hello, can I interest you
in spell:such and such?", turned around, and one of those pictures
slid into the wall and a player came out.

Oops. :)
