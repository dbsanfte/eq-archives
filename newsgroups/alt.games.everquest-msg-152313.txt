	Um, no.

	What it means is that rather than crank out another free zone that no one
will use *coughstonebruntcough*, they'll spend some time working on the
existing zones that no one uses.  Maybe fixing some of the 2,000 or so
unsolvable quests in the game.  Maybe putting two and two together and finally
realising that the reason no one goes into dungeons with Goblins is because
they're all filled with green-agro casters that can nuke level 60 characters
into the ground.

	They'll continue to make expansions as long as people bought the last one,
trust me.
