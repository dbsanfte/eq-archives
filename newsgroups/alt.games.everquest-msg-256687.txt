Well, it depends what kind of guild you are in.  It's nice to be able to
trust guildies and I understand that not all guilds are like that, but dont
assume all guilds are the other way either.  The problem I see with that
system is that is cumbersome.  Why not just have the ones that can use it
/random.  Much quicker.
