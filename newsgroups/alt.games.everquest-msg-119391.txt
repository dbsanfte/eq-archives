Are you referring to your system temporarily freezing, causing lag on your
part, causing the server to think you've just quit holding any arrow keys on
the keyboard & are intentionally standing still, causing the mob to continue
to catch up with you, and when your system starts going up at normal speed
again (even if it's only happening for a few 10ths of a second, that is
enough if it happens a few times), the mob has caught up with you, is now
running at the same speed as you, pounding you till you're dead, due to the
lag on your system?

(I think I just wrote one hell of a run-on sentence???)
