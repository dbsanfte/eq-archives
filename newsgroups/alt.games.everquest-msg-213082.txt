    Not nerfed. There's two skeletons that get caught in a corner of the
pyramid where the red-con NPC is. They used to path from there, to the
central building where they'd take up positions outside the door, and then
away again. Since there's an object in the corner where they get caught, the
only way to pull them without walking in and getting both (and possibly Mr.
Red NPC if he hates you) is to target them with something like Sense The
Dead. For all you 'sploiters in the crowd, when they're stuck in the corner
you could target them from outside that pyramid with Sense The Dead and
blast away through the pyramid - they'll never warp on top of you. My
necromancer did that a few times until I wandered around to the back of the
pyramid and found it to be hollow, not solid as I suspected, and started
pulling them out normally.

    They spawn faster than that. My necromancer kills them as fast as they
spawn, with a little time left over, and does so in the time it takes for
Dooming Darkness to end. She also chain-pulls, no med time required. Dooming
Darkness lasts 1.5 minutes, so with your description she'd clear the place
in a little over 6 minutes and be waiting around for the next 14. What I've
noticed is the repops seem to be clusters, where multiple mobs (looks like
two) pop from one spawn point. Perhaps you had one mob from each cluster
left up?

    I fear kite, so I need a bit of room, but that would work nicely for the
cleric/warrior pair. The only thing I hate about the pyramid is I always
have SoW on, and running down it you're pretty much guaranteed to take some
falling damage.

    Brother Balatin: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=254

    He and his placeholder despawn from time to time, so you usually don't
need to wait long for the PH. Killing him raises iksar monk faction, and
lowers faction with the Whistling Fist Brotherhood (Whistling Fists quest)
and with the mysterious "Combine Empire", whoever or whatever that is. No
loot, but if you run out of regular mobs he makes a nice, light snack (he's
lower level than the plaguebones, roughly 30 to 33).

    He's part of the bard epic quest. He's Dubious to my necromancer, and
Scowls at my shaman in bear form, so I stay away from his level 60 ass.

    When did you last go there? My necromancer last killed the Wraithbone
about a month ago. Only ever saw two, but I usually avoid the area behind
the central pyramid anyways. He's not worth the effort, in my opinion - he
has a ton of HPs relative to anything else around there.
