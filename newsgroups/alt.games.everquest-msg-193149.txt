Bah give me a smaller 3 or 4 person group any day for xp.  9 players? 
ever been on a raid?  Know how long it takes to get organized.  I
imagine this is just a headache.  

We used to do 7 person groups in some spots where it was advantageous,
sometimes even a couple groups - if you aren't after (and are after
loot) it doesn't even matter if you are in the same group really.
