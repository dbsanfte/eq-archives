I think it's true that old saying "a bad enchanter is better than none at
all."

What makes you qualified to tell another class what buffs they do or do not
need?  If the answer is "because I have a <class> about the same level,"
cool.  Otherwise, cast the spell & quit yer bitchin.  Just because
enchanters are the most powerful class doesn't mean you know everything (or
even a lot) about other classes.

You play a high elf, don't you?
