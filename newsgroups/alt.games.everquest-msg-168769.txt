I have all the latest drivers, patches, updates, equipment, and about 25% of
the time logging in, my mouse cursor is stuck in the top left corner of the
screen and I can't do anything other than Ctrl-Alt-Del out and restart the
whole launch process all over again and hope that I don't see this twice in
a row. I thought it was something anomalous in my system until I noticed the
same thing happened to my wife's machine, and I noticed that the EQ Support
page actually contains this question in the FAQ, suggesting that it is a
common occurrence. Unfortunately, they don't have any useful advice other
than the usual "update your drivers" suggestion.

Anyone else encounter this and figure out how to avoid the problem?

Thanks,
