It's not really a game mechanics thing that causes it.  Basically the 
argument goes something like this: levels get you groups faster and AA 
generally lets you kill faster/more efficiently.  If you split between AA 
and levels early on you end up not leveling as fast with a mediocre set of 
AAs that have marginal utility.  In general you'll get AAs faster at 65 
than you will earlier on.  Exceptions might be if you still solo/group in 
old world zones where the XP drops off significantly in higher levels.  And 
there are some AAs that are class defining (like EQ/AM3, SoS or Canni5) 
that you might want to get before 65.

In the end, do what you want; it's your money, your time and your XP.  
Though people might laugh at you if you decide to max out your general AAs 
at level 51.  Not unlike the cleric on Karana that didn't know there was 
anything other than general AAs, and remained a level 65 baron for a very 
long time (apparently he just ignored those little tabs across the top of 
the window; he sucked as a cleric anyway).
