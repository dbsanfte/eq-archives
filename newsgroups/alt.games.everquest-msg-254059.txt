You make it sound like they'd get a raise out of the deal, when in 
reality, the income tax would just be shifted directly to the 
individual, who would turn around and give it to the government anyways.

(ie suppose I'm paid 1k; 200 hundred is going to be paid in income tax, 
and the company, matches it for another 200. If we get rid of the tax at 
the corporate side, I take home that 200 (yay!), and the the government 
shifts the tax burden directly to me, taking 400 from me in income 
tax... I end up exactly where I started.

Unless there is a progresive tax in place, and making that extra 200 
pushes me over to the next tax bracket... and suddenly I'm taxed another 
50 (total 450) and am now behind the game!!!

Its a fantasy to think that removing corporate taxes on wages is going 
to amount to a raise for everybody; its safe to assume a government, 
particularly one running huge deficits, is going to recapture that 
revenue somewhere else.
