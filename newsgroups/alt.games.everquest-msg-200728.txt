Yes its a game. Not a single player game and therefore the emotional
attachment

I have played new characters on new servers. Made new friends.
But to be honest after you see 90 some percent of your online buddies move
on it can feel like work making friends at times. I think that is what this
game really is. A new version of the local slough to play hockey on. It's
more about the friends than game. Although the game definitely matters. Kids
didn't go to the ice to play marbles or tiddly winks.

Same emotions as high school or college or moving out of an area.
Exciting to move on yet nostalgia for the old time get together.

I still play the game but more as a hanger on.
Even being a guild officer helping out newbs was fun for awhile.
hmm first guild raid 3 newbs fell thru the hole in the floor in befallen
near SK female in befallen.
funny what you forget you instinctively learn over the years.

It takes energy to maintain friendships. The game creates the energy to fuel
that energy.
When the excitement of playing wanes well .. one cause of burnout or
goodbye.

I will probably stop playing for awhile until EQ2. Saving up the energy for
that.

And that's my take on it.
