I still remember having to micromanage a solar energy collector because the
sunlight energy of one day was radically different to the next, the way the
beast master guys were the toughest group and seemed to have invaded Star
Wars from the Pikachu universe, Having to run from town to town because
there were no vehicles, having really tough monsters spawning inside the
local shopping areas for no adequately explored reason, the dancer as a
player class (worst idea ever, why not have plumber and carpet cleaner,
while we are at it), the way the wookie bowcaster sucked...

Mny things that made me look at the wonderful; graphics and recalling A Fish
Called Wanda, say "these people could WATCH Star Wars. They just couldn't
UNDERSTAND it".
