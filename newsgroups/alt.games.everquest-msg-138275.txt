Good idea...on paper. Trouble is, I don't think most newbs who could
afford it (and need it) would be willing to pay for it. Too often,
it's just not considered a critical skill to learn right away, much to
the chagrin of any baby alt I roll up. The ones who do see it as such
are typically willing to do a bit of research on their own anyway.
