Ahh - in that case I am going to have to resist the urge of fast XP from AoE
kiting and concetrate on old fashioned getting the shite kicked outta the
bard for defence gain. I can handle not having weapons skill up to par as a
higher level bard is not a mellee class but defence equals AC - which equals
living through some mistakes/unexpected heappenings instead of yet another
"learning experience".

On an unrelated note: I have detect trap / disarm trap and tracking all
mapped to my ->  (right arrow) key for automatic skill gain which has been
working fine, even to the point of not being near a trap to raise "disarm
trap". You get a message saying no traps detected but you slowly raise
regardless. Anyway  -I was passing through Echo Caverns, turn tight which
happened to activate my detect/disarm hotkeys and bam - it detected and
disarmed those floating anenome looking that like to latch onto you and
start draining your health. I was pretty chuffed about that as I had no idea
they were classed as a trap : )
