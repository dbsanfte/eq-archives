The paladin Ro quests are great... if you're wearing banded or less.  Still,
with the plat you dump into the platinum bars, I'd recommend a trip to the
bazaar.  You can outfit yourself with a nice set of Validous Custodous (sp?)
gear and still have enough left over to buy some +AGI stuff (which you'll
need if you're decked out in VC gear).  It's on-par with Ro, and doesn't
require you to kill good races to get.  All in all, I'd call that a good
thing.

The only drawback is not having the pride of having earned your gear (which
was kinda cool... before I did the quests, the only piece of plate armor I
had was the L Guk leggings for the Lambent... yes, I was so underequipped,
that was an upgrade).
