Eh, it can still be done.  Just forget you ever heard of the <img> tag.

Compare and contrast these two pages:

http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Enchanter
http://www.geocities.com/zinphandelchianti/encspell.html

My page is 57k.  That's probably smaller than the 'UGO' logo image up in 
the corner of the castersrealm page.  It's also printer-friendly and 
compatible with most every browser out there.  Hmm... well, any browser 
that supports tables. You might need netscape 3ish or better.  

Therefore, even if I got oh, 4000 hits a day on it, geocities probably 
wouldn't even notice.  A picture may be worth a thousand words, but 
sometimes, the thousand words is more intrinsically useful.

And thanks, y'all, for visiting my focus effects page 688 times this 
month.  Makes me feel all warm and wiggly. :)
