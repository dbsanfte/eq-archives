I have a 55th enc. Here are my trades.

Fletching 202
Pottery 200
Jewel 200
Baking 200
Pottery 200
Tailoring 200
Smiting 120

You mean to tell me I have to delete my 141 days played char and start a new
one to get my jewel craft to 250 because I had no Idea you can only have one
skill over 200? Remind me again why I pay 10 a month?
