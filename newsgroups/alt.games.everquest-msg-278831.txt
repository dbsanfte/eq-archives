Hi All,

How the heck do you get into the guild hall? I've clicked all over the door 
and all I get is "You cannot reach that" or no response. Of course that 
assumes that the guild hall entrance looks just like the PoK entrance to the 
bazaar and that it is just the other side of the building that houses Darius 
and the food merchant in PoK. Otherwise, I have no idea what I'm clicking 
on. lol

Thanks,

Mike W.
