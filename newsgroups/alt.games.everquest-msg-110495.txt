I was in Overthere for the billionth time it seems.  Was soloing with my 40
Bard in the southeast area.  I was charming a spiked succulent and having it
tank a sabertooth tiger when 2 times I got a debuff icon that didn't last
too long at all and would end with "You are no longer captivated".  It
didn't seem to do anything too debilitating, but I've never seen this, and
I'm pretty sure there was nothing else around me.

What could have cast this on me?

TIA,
Sean...
