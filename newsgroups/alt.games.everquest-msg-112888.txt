Nothing else it could be in my case...I _really_ don't use this email
address anywhere else.  I did about 2 years ago, but this spam started a
few days after I started posting on this newsgroup. Not to blame this
group or anything...I'm sure posting on any newsgroup would catch spammers
attention.  

Speaking of which....I use Pine, and it's associated news reader, for
viewing and posting here.  I prefer it because I don't like browsers for
my newsgroup/email needs, and it's more convenient for my lifestyle than
having to download software onto every machine I use throughout the day.

Does anyone else out there use Pine and know of a way to mask my address,
if I wished to start now?  (Rather too late, but I suppose damage control
is still possible).
