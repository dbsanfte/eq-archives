Wouldn't work for the following reasons -

1) Like Windows, Linux only supports one set of video drivers at a
time - would require the ability to accurately detect the video card,
and make a decision (a la Xconfigurator), all the while assuming there
is even an available driver for that particular card (bets, anyone?) 
2) Would require the ability to detect and load a large variety of
sound drivers, and to this day, there are still some modern cards that
are not supported by Linux
3) Linux USB support is still Alpha, which would screw everyone using
a USB mouse, DSL Modem, Cable Modem, etc... 
4) would, to be realistic, require the partitioning of a hard drive to
support all files which must be stored natively.  Let's face it, fat32
and ext/ext32, etc etc etc, are not exactly compatible, in spite of
attempts to cross the barriers... unless you want to put in a native
samba server as well...
5) load and go games, and save to an external disk, went extinct with
the death of Atari, Commodore, et al...
