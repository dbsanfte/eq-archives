   I did leave out some details in the interest of trying to keep the post
fairly long instead of insanely wrong.

   I did ask the leader, who was the ranger, if he would pull if pac'd.  I was
addressing him directly in group chat, using his name.  He ignored me.  I asked
some other tank type, I forget which, the same question.  Again, nothing.  It
was as if I were simply talking to myself.  And I did pretty much take control
of the group once I realized what was going on, but there was simply no response
from the tanks when I asked them about pulling.  Ya, I should have taken it to
tells, but didn't think of it at the time.

    I do have my spell effects on low, but I didn't notice anyone other than me,
the shaman and druid casting any spells.  I think the tank types were simply
running up to the mob and going into auto attack.  Maybe they were taunting too,
but I couldn't tell.  I would go down to half or a quarter health before they
got it off of me, usually, and I couldn't sit without regaining agro.  It didn't
occur to me at the time, but it is possible that some were botted.  I didn't
ask.

    I think that the best way to handle it would have been to follow the
suggestion to formally be made leader, then start booting people if needed to
make a point.  But, I was a bit wary of doing that since I don't want to play
into the stereotype of the bossy, prima donna cleric bitch type.  But perhaps I
shouldn't have worried that much and really have gone for the gusto.
