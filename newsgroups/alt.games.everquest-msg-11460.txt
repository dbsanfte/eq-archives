>Much lower ac? Much lower than what?

oh much lower than the ac of warriors , sks , paladins , and bards in that
order .

> Severe weight limit? Doesn't seem that severe to me.

Im sure it dosent if you have never played anything but a monk . The
question is what do you gain by having it since no other class has such a
limit? It should be a tradeoff for above normal abilities elsewhere . What
exactly do you think they are? 3rd best melee dammager out of 3 non
spellcasters ?

Ah so maybe perhaps you are a monk that uses all gear only useable by a
monk? I know mine is wearing predominately all/all gear . For instance azure
sleeves , runebranded girdle , crown of the froglok kings , spider fur cloak
just to name a few . The only monk only item i use is a sceptre of mastery
from kael . A weapon . I could twink with pretty much whatever I want and im
using all/ all gear . Explain please why your gear is better?

I knew the pitfalls of the monk class long before I started one so resent
the implication that im whining . I will however continue to point out that
the classes are not in the least bit balanced . This is particularly easy to
see if you take the 3 combat classes and look at them at 60 .

The rogue is the best at dealing dammage par none (at least half again as
much as any other ), He has secondary skills that are at the very least
extremely usefull, and is some cases absolutely essential . He has the same
basic armor class as a ranger who verant swears is a semi tank. Has the
minor disadvantage of some vendors not liking him because of his class but
can use one of his abilities to counter it .

The warrior deals good solid dammage . Has next to no secondary abilities .
And is the absolute best at taking dammage of any class in the game .

The monk does good solid dammage , just a bit below a warrior . Has a few
special abilities that have some use but is not the only class to have such
. Is the 5th best at taking dammage . Has a severe restriction of a weight
limit .

Before kunark came out I think monks where balanced correctly . Feign worked
fairly well which made a monk a premier puller . They nerfed and now it
requires 2 feigners to do the job one did before . Before kunark monks
outdammaged warriors by about 50% to make up for there lack of tanking
ability, and as a balance for the weight limit monks faced . Kunark
destroyed the balance among all the classes, the monk lost quite a bit in
the rebalance . Since they are trying to regain the delicate balance they
had before kunark , I see no reason not to point out where they screwed up.
