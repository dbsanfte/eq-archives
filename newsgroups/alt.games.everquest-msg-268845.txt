That's what I mean - you may belong to a neutral race, but your
character can never be neutral, you must be aligned with a city.
Unless, I guess, you betray your city to the point that they won't let
you back in but don't complete it to go the other city, but then
you're forever stuck at level 19 or below since you can't get a class
quest (or so I assume).
