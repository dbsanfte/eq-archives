No.  To my mind what is fair is for the raider to be at a druid ring
sufficiently in advance so as not to hold up  and inconvenience the entire
raiding party. 

Unfair, unthinking and slovenly is to show up late, inconvenience the entire
raid, and then expect  everyone to wait, the druid or wizzie to drop whet he's
doing and come port the *star* to the game.

I did not join a guild to be a port whore.
