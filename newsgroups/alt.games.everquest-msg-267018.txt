I didn't experience any appreciable lag, aside from the server crashes it 
runs fine for me.  I am wondering if it is an issue with your video card. 
Have you checked the forums to see the X800/ATI threads?  I know during beta 
there were some issues with ATI in general so that may be a good place to 
start.  Look at the "Known issues with EQ2" thread and install the 
recommended drivers that they have listed there.

With your machine you shouldn't have any trouble running the game, I know 
several people with similar rigs that run it fine.  My second machine is 
also an Athlon 2700+, 1Gig, and a 9800XT and it runs well on that.  I can't 
turn the graphics up like I can on my primary, but it runs pretty well.

Check into the driver issue and look for ATI threads on the official forums, 
maybe someone has some ideas there.
