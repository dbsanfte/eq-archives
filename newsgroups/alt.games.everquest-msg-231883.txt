I done this elsewhere....1) their basic design would have been based on
what was there and the issues raised, 2) the pbem field had all this data
and the problems were plain in that field and they WERE that popular and
3) Avalon at the very least had a very large number of players connected
compared to most things at the time and a large player base and complex
data sets for storage (I've seen the code as a friend was developing based
on their engine for a while). THe information, and worries were there, the
games to compare were as well.

Heck there had even been a isometric 3D pure multiplayer game already
(erg Dragon summat or other was the name). It didnt do wonderfully well as
lag was such a big issue with it but any dev team on that field should
have known about it....
