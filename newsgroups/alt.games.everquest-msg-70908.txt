The second part is not even true if you install the latest expansion. I've got
a AMD equivalent of a P2, and sure, I lag a lot, but the game is still very
playable, and I'm certainly not "hosed."

People with Voodoos are either hosed already, or they will be hosed in the not
too distant future. One could honestly say they were hosed the moment their
cards ceased to be supported by the company that created them.
