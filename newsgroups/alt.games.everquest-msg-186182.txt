Started a dwarf cleric a little while ago.Went to Kelethin after 6 levels to
go orc hunting (its been years since I've been here for any length of
time)it was a little light on players but I didn't think too much about
it.Got to 9th level got my spells then got on the boat to Freeport.I ran to
ec and start hunting to get up to 10th I'm here now and I've noticed the (in
my day) precious orc camps are always without players where did they go?
