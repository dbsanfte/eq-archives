A pain, but not a huge issue, esp at early levels... you die at 1-4,
who cares?

>2. Nightblind until Level 51

Night blindness should never be an issue in Everfrost - that zone is
far brighter than the Vah Shir newbie area, even with infavision.

As can trolls and Iksar... and every other race except ogre, IIRC.

Not bloody likely... anyone that starts a barbarian in Halas, and
leaves that zone without either being in full banded, or with 3-400pp
in the bank by level 9 has absolutely no clue how to play the zone.

I seriously had to resist the urge to twink my BL, and managed to
survive the urge... in a period of 4 days of casual play, making level
7, already had 185pp in the bank... don't know about anyone else's
server, but HQ bear skins sell for between 25 and 30pp ea on Zeb...
and they are not that rare of a drop off of polar bear cubs... screw
trade skills early on... sell those lq/mq pelts for a couple gp
each... it adds up, and quickly... and the level 1-4 that buys food or
drink is a fool.

You can hit level 4 without ever leaving the t-section at the bottom
of the Halas ramp... and just whip up on skellies, gnoll pups and
gobby's for 2 quick levels... at 3, beat the hell out of polar bear
cubs... same with 4... at 5, you can either stick with cubs, or go out
just beyond the north entrance to the tundra, and camp gobby scouts...
do them 5-6... at 7, entrance to BB... blue cons all the way to 8 or
9... all without ever leaving the zone... 

and for even easier cash, kill the skellies carrying weapons... 1 to 2
gp each, up to a pp if you get a staff, is not chump change at low
levels.

lvl 8 or 9, find some like minded people and wail on mammoth calves,
orc troopers, snow leapords, etc... hit 12 or 13 that way, and then
start soloing the calves... Everfrost only gets bad for exp from about
15 to 20 or so... then you can start on mommas, and group then solo
them to 30... 

True, there are better zones past 10, but not many... and since we are
talking BL's here, ultimately the best place to learn to solo.

And, FWIW, my shammy solo'ed his first vengy at 5... talk about the
absolute overcon of the game.
