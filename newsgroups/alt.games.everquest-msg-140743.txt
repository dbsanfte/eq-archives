Food has stat bonuses. Alchohol not sure.

As for how exp is distributed well its no use asking really. There are alot
of factors to be taken into consideration in xp distribution. Such as the
race, class and level. More people usually means that you can knock down
mobs faster (assuming you have a virtually endless supply of mobs like in
some zones). Earning a bit less xp but the higher kill rate negates that
effect totally.
