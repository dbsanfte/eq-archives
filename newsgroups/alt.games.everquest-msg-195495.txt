    I get the ten dose ones, the LVL/2 + 1 type, for 350 pp in the Quellious
Bazaar from an always-available trader named Fenugreek. Presumably the
character is an alchemy mule at max skill, as she usually has the lowest
potion prices across the board and carries a fantastic selection including
the various Homeland Gate potions.

    I will mention that they more than paid for themselves when I was
soloing in Nadox, trying to get the components for my Pure Blood spell. The
amount of damage one ten dose potion did over the course of my time there is
nothing short of profane.
