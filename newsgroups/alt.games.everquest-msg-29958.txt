But you *do* ignore the major difference between a "camp" and a "farm". When
you are camping something, you are looking to obtain either experience or a
single, specific of loot (such as the ring off the Ancient Cyclops) or both.
When you are farming something, you are hunting green mobs for the loot, over
and over again. Camping is a necessity in Everquest, whether you are soloing
or in a single group or part of a multi-group raid. Farming, in many cases,
just as much a necessity (so speaks a tailor about to start a 36 skill point
push by making Wu's armor.)

Again: why is is worse for a single person to solo a spawn point than for a
group?

That is fine when you need so much time to recover between mobs that the
critter spawns before you are ready. I spent level 26 with another druid,
sharing the Hermit in South Karana. But if I can keep up with the spawn on my
own, why is it wrong for me to hold the camp alone?

Why should the soloer have to move on? I have always been courteous to say,
"Give me a bit longer, and I will let you know when I am about to leave", but
that is just me being courteous. I

So why are you complaining?
