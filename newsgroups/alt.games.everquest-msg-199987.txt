hi

the other day, i brought my guild to chardok for the cleric epic fight

i read everything i could about the king (i had never been deeper than the
bridges in chardok), as did the cleric who was getting his epic

so we planned, brought our guildies, fought fought fought fought fought
fought and got to a locked door....

and we looked at each other and said "wtf?"

we're a really small organiziation...that night we were 53 cleric 59 pally
62 enc 54 war 54 war 53 mnk and then like sub-50 mage enc druid wiz . . . we
brought what we needed and we did FINE, it just took a while

we didn't know we needed a rogue, and it was not mentioned on allakhazam or
by any of our friends

so.....i'm 1/2 asking WHY we never heard we needed a rogue (is it assumed
that raids have rogues?) and 1/2 just kind of upset that our tactical
cleverness was underminded by a simple locked door

(BTW we didn't feel like running at the door until we get 'popped'
through-we dont cheat, we just left and swore to go back next week)

anyway, .........yeah
