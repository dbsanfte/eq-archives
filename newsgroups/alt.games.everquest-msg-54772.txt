He entertained you for three days; you really should be thanking him.

I'd have thought that after the nine hundredth "EverQuest sucks and ruins
your life" post that you'd just ignore at least one of them, but no, you're
one Hell of a determined flamer.  When "EverQuest sucks and ruins your life"
post nine-thousand and one rolls in, I'm sure you'll be here to flame it,
and I for one will be here to watch you do it!

I love reading your flames, you put so much hard work into them, some people
might think you're just a loon or a kook but, I for one appreciate it.
Keep up the good work bizbee.

Hats off to you sir!
