Well basically nothing, but then if you can successfully charm kill
things, you will probably get more exp that way than with the pally
helping anyway.  Of course there is always aggro kiting or fear
kiting, if possible...

Straight melee kinda suck duoing with good solo classes such as Necro,
Chanter, and Druid, at least at the high levels in certain situations.
 These classes can do so much more if they group with non-melee damage
dealers.  I take my Ranger to tactics and group with Chanters all the
time.  They love ensnare.  But the last thing they want is a rogue or
monk coming to help.
