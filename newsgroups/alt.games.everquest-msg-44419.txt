Shaman are good, mainly because of slows.

>(mana free
>nuke)

You said it.

More damage:
* Saves cleric mana (the mob is alive for less time, so it does less damage)
* Brings in more exp (the more mobs you kill...)
* Makes the rogue twice as valuable (or more) as, for example, a second
warrior, when being added to the group.

Say you're using this group:
1 enchanter
2 warriors
1 monk
1 cleric
1 magician

Only one warrior at a time can be taking the damage (preferably the one with
the highest AC). Replace one warrior with a rogue and you have the same role
(damage dealing) covered better. The rogue probably does about 1400 damage a
minute (if not more), while the warrior is doing 700 (or less) per minute.

So, in my rambling sentence construction, there you have an explanation of why
rogues are good.
