True.  And I know more than one person who's had their wallet or purse 
stolen from their car doing almost exactly that.  It was gas stations and 
not kwik-e-marts, but the same principle applies.

How's Sony's site relevant?  My firewall has blocked over 1500 potentially 
harmful direct attacks on my IP since I reinstalled it a couple months 
ago.  What's to stop one of those harmful attacks from landing in the two 
minutes I was forced to lower all my defenses?  A competent skript kiddie 
(oxymoron, I know. :) ) could do a lot of harm to my system in two whole 
minutes...
