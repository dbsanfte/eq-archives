How do you know?

I mean, its entirely possible that you are right, I'm not denying that. 
  And in fact I admitted as much, as you see from where you quoted me above.

But its entirely possible, too, that you aren't.  This isn't a return to 
classic EQ, its a restriction to the original lands released with 
classic EQ.  They've already said that many of the features of modern EQ 
will be included; spells every level instead of clusters every 4, 5, or 
9, spells that weren't originally in the game, so on and so forth.

Exactly which features will and won't be in the game for this server is 
largely a matter of conjecture, except for the few hints which have 
leaked out of beta or from the developers (to the extent that they are 
at all reliable).

I can see saying that certain spells which you can only buy from two 
spots in Velious won't be in the game till Velious is open, for example; 
after all, you can't go buy them unless they deliberately change the 
vendor stock for the server.

I've seen them say that you'll have the added bank slots, the shared 
bank, and so forth, though, even though those came out much later.

But /claim is available from anywhere, any continent, all it requires is 
that you bought the expansion in box and haven't used it yet.  So... maybe.

Could be.  But wouldn't it be sweet?

Since I don't actually need the mount on any of my current characters, I 
   might as well wait and see.
