Bill Clinton was the first president in a long time to have a
noticable impact on my life. And a positive one at that. I can now
drive 65mph on the freeway thanks to Bill. God bless him.

Georg Jr. wrote me a check for $300.00. God bless him. He also got me
out of the Kyoto Treaty. God bless him.

Other than that, the only time a presidents desicion has touched my
life is Jimmy Carter. He lifted the federal ban on brewing beer in
your own home. God bless him. (Ironically, though, he is also the one
who imposed the 55mph federal speed limit that I bless Bill for
lifting.)
