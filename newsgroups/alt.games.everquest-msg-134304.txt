OK, so the patch isn't quite live yet after all.

Does it make sense to run the patcher anyway?

Here's my thinking, patches often consist of several
files.  Each may take some time to download.  If
the final fiddling with the patch only involves only
one of the several, then I'll at least have the rest
ready, to shorten my DL time.

Further, the Jaggedpine patch should be relatively
bulletproof, since they not only ran it on test (they
are very bad at using test as a patch test platform)
but on a real live server that functions with something
close to the rest of our rule set and interface.

So at least I can probably get downloading JP out
of the way while I wait, no?
