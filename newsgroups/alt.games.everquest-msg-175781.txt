"Captain of our Souls"

Today we may say aloud before an awe-struck world: "We are still masters of
our fate. We are still captain of our souls." Prime Minister's Speech on the
War Situation, House of Commons, September 9, 1941

"Linchpin of the English-speaking world"

"Canada is the linchpin of the English-speaking world. Canada, with those
relations of friendly, affectionate intimacy with the United States on the
one hand and with her unswerving fidelity to the British Commonwealth and
the Motherland on the other, is the link which joins together these great
branches of the human family, a link which, spanning the oceans, brings the
continents into their true relation and will prevent in future generations
any growth of division between the proud and the happy nations of Europe and
the great countries which have come into existence in the New World." Speech
given at a luncheon in honour of Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada,
Mansion House, London, September 4, 1941.

"Never Give In"

The speech was made 29 October 1941 to the boys at Churchill's old public
[private] school, Harrow--not Oxford or Cambridge:"Never give in--never,
never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give
in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force;
never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.''

"We shall fight on the beaches"

"We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We
shall fight in the fields, and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills.
We shall never surrender!" Speech about Dunkirk given in House of Commons
June 4, 1940.
