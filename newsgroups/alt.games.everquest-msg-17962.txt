Im sick and tired hearing people slag them and their products down, its just
inverted snobbery. People like to laugh at windows users and aol
subscribers...why exactly? I use windows 98 and AOL is my isp. I dont want to
run linux or any other UNIX os just so i can take the piss out of windows users
and aol provides me with perfectly satisfactory internet access. I read this
newsgroup using their own reader, it reads the ng! thats pretty much im all im
interested in. I tried opera as a browser but it offers nothing I.E doesnt so
whats all the fuss about?? Windows isnt fail safe , no piece of sodtware is,
but i have had few problems and it isnt half as bugged as people make out. And
if you think a chimp could use it check out the registry :P
AOL connects me at a respectable rate and the lines are never busy (i cant say
that much about other free isp's) they have e-mail, a browser and FTP so what
is so bad about them?
