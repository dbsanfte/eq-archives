The more I look at this the more impossible it seems that they have 
actually found a way to make it work as they said it does. Which ever way I 
change the numbers I end up with the Levels of the group changing what xp 
is gained by both the orriginal and the new party members.

Can anyone work out a way that a group of different level players still get 
the same xp with 6 in the group as with 5 in the group (other than adding 
only a player that is the average level) ?

Jim
