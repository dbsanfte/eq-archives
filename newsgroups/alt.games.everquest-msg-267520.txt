Yes, I am doing that. Without that, regenning from yellow or red takes
forever. With auto-food/water, I can usually fill up from red in a
minute or so, and if I'm running around looking for mobs, I'm usually
filled up by the time I find another one.

Unless I'm grouped, I prefer to stand in area (usually on a rock,
stump, or something else elevated) and just camp the respawn of
whatever mob I'm after.

It'd be nice if I could turn off auto-food/water when I'm camping easy
solo mobs that my beetle summon can kill on its own. Paying 12c every
few minutes seems like a waste if I'm just killing gray or green mobs
for some quest.
