Warning: meandering, nostalgic, slightly whiney pseudo-rant follows...

I got EQ (plus Kunark expansion) as a gift.  At the time, Velious was
available as well, but I didn't have it.

I started up a human warrior in Freeport (I always start new RPGs as a
human warrior, to get comfortable and familiar with the interface).

It was an awe inspiring experience.  I ran into lots of nice people of
all levels in Freeport.  It was the interaction with other live players
that got me hooked.  I was playing with *other people* from around the
(real) world.  This EQ world was alive and breathing.  It was incredible!

I left EQ (for the second time, and hopefully, permanently) about six
months ago.  When I finally left, the world was dead.  Okay, there are
a few ridiculously busy zones, like the giant PoK (which really killed
the performance of my machine).  But places like PoK are *too* busy for
my taste.  I felt like SOE decided we're all sardines and should be
parked in this one zone.  A one stop shop for all your adventuring needs.

It's not what I wanted.

I wax nostalgic for the days when the newbie cities were actually places
with lots of people to run into and interact with.  For the life of me,
I'll never understand why SOE decided to add zones like PoK and seriously
dilute the value of all the other cities as a result.  And why they also
decided to balance the zones poorly with respect to one another, the
result being the over-camped Paludal and the under-used, well, everything
else.

Most of the world is like a sad ghost town now, the game a heaven for
power-levelers, but kind of sad, and barren, and dissapointing, to
non-power-levelers.  It doesn't live and breathe anymore.  My opinion is
that PoP was the first nail in the coffin: it trivialized too many cities
and made travel pointlessly easy.  (In a living, breathing world, travel
can be half the fun!  It doesn't always have to be about rushing to your
next xp grinding spot!)

Yes, I know, I know...you don't *have* to travel via PoK, you don't have
to go there at all.  You can walk!...but it's not the same anymore.  If
you're lucky you'll run into one person going the other direction...no
more living, breathing world.  Abandoned.

I'm just posting this hoping SOE will listen, and perhaps tune EQ2 with
some of these random thoughts of mine in mind...  Perhaps, if SOE is
reading this, my opinions and thoughts are useless to them: perhaps the
real money is to be made catering to the power-levelers, who need their
instant travel to be happy, who need a few well identified power XP zones
to speed up that XP grind.

Then again, perhaps SOE needs to make sure the EQ2 world is living and
breathing: never EVER allow content to become trivialized!  I never
thought I'd sit around and get nostalgic about the EC tunnel or Faymart!
Gods, I miss running into people who are part of a world, and play the
part!  Instead of power-gamers who just want to get the right classes
together for yet *another* LDoN run, with little to no social interaction,
only a few utterances to improve the efficiency of the crawl.

I miss starting an alt in a new city and running into other players.
Back in the old days (cue the "walking uphill in snow both ways to
school" music in the background) there was always people around willing
to show you the ropes in a new city, it was a great way to make new
friends.  It was so refreshing to get a weapon from a higher up, and
their only request?  "Make sure you do the same for someone lower level
than you some day."  (And I always did, 10x over!)

Now it's just zone after zone of emptiness.  "Get thee to Paludal," is
the only answer, where you're greeted not by a living, breathing world
full of people, but a power-gamer paradise: no time for talk, gotta grind
out that next level, until I get go to the next XP rich zone and grind
out some more, while ignoring all the deprecated, unloved content that
used to be filled with adventure, and socialization, and fun before...

pointless meandering whining mode off...
