You don't even need to have an offensive name to get it nerfed by the name
nazis... anything that's too long, too many similar letters, or just
anything that annoys whattever GM/Guide is currently in the middle of a 'bad
day' and feels he/she has to take it out on someone.

What's the possible problem with 'Billybobbobobob'? (pronounced Billy Bob
Bo-Bo Bob... if you can remember the episode of 'Pinky and The Brain' it
comes from, you'll get the joke)
