Tuning "balance" to gear that's not on over 50% of the population is silly
really IMHO.  WA5 at 305 dex increases proc rate on standard proc items
from 2 ppm to a whopping 3ppm, nice kinda, but still BFD in many ways. :)


: So can anybody else with a Taunt button, like, say, another Warrior.

A successful taunt gets the taunter to top of hatelist+1.  If I have to
get into an agro fight with a Knight I will lose. period.

I'm aware of this. :)  It's pretty useful but mostly in a survival kind of
way or to help pull of a reasonably sane tank swap.  Only time I've used
/furious in a planned way recently was vs. this named criter in Qinimi that's
part of the BiC.  Cleared area, equipped Dathor Hammer, plonked mob with
arrow, mashed furious, mob got lotsa damage real fast and died eventually. :)
But most of the times I've personally used Furious has been in "Oh Shit"
situations, agro gone bad and 2*10^64 mobs come swarming in, mash /furi mash
AE-Taunt, pray cleric gets someplace to camp safe. :)

: IN FORCED SINGLE-GROUP CONTENT.

Forced single group has existed since PoP.  PoJ Trials anyone?  Mind you,
those are relatively weak compared to the GoD things but as I've said
GoD was and is still in many ways an utter waste of an expansion for the
masses.  Also, tanks never really tanked there.  That was left to Mr. pookah.
All melee for those mobs were and still are from what I've been reading still
speedbumps to let Mr. Pookah gank it.  All this nerf to /def did was to
once again re-inforce and enhance the role of the Enchanter.  Knights and Wars
are now both going splat should they attempt to tank those.

: effectively in KT+ as who don't.  So it's probably mostly a matter

Once again, the sound Tactic is using a hasted charmed 1200 hitting critter
to obliterate the mob.
