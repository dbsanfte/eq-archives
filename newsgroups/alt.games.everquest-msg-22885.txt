 all/all 0.0 weight isn't a bad monk item either. I'm not sure why
everyone seems to consider this a caster item just because it happens to
have 30cha. It ends up giving you around 17ac if you factor in the agi.
I forgot the formula on agi to ac though so that could be wrong.

 I'd maybe give 2k for that if I didn't have anything better. Froggy
crown is ac12 and has some nice fr/cr resists for around 1k so I
wouldn't place the jester crown more than double.
