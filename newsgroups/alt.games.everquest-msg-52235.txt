What difference does that make?
A warrior can LEVEL solo.  He will obviously need a full guild to get
the armor.

Not quite.
You can still dual quest velious armors last I checked.  Warlord's BP
is AC59, just one off CoFM.

But that's beside the point.

Why?
Because it takes a whopping 3 groups to go and farm the shit outta
Sleeper's Tomb?

And what difference does this make to a warrior soloing to level 60?

Yep, why not?
You can do it with full cobalt.
Remember, old world mobs have a soft cap at 1100AC.  Anyone over
1100AC will take virtually no damage from the mob let alone someone
who is 10 levels higher than what those mobs were tuned for.

Hell, a level 60 warrior wearing full indocite can probably break the
king spawn without problems.

>By solo to 60 I don't mean, solo a mob or 5 every once in a while.

He can and has broken the King spawn and cleared all the way to the
elemental room with just a fungi tunic on.  He would often *forget* to
switch out of the fungi tunic.

Also remember, at higher levels a warrior's combat table changes.  At
level 51+, he gets a higher damage combat table.  The damage output
against old world mobs is ridiculous.
