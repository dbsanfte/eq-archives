Specs won't roam unless pulled.

Specs wander the beach when whoever pulled them dies, zones or feigns... if
they don't even /shout a warning, they're scum.

The type of player that doesn't shout a warning, is usually the type of
player that can't communicate in a group... something that's VITAL by the
time you hit the 40s... which is why he/she is stuck trying to solo an 8
spawn Fear-Caster... and getting innocent bystanders killed in the process.

The trouble is they don't CARE if lowbies die. It's just a hazard of
Oasis... you go there to hunt the plentiful Crocs (it IS good XP, after all)
and if you get caught by a Spec (or SG/Cazel) from some careless
40-something, you'll make the XP back in 2 or 3 kills. It's annoying and
you'll come across more of the same as you level and hunt in more dangerous
zones.

The up-side is that you'll learn to recognise the dangers of careless pulls
by other players... and stand more chance of avoiding becoming train-fodder
in a place where a CR is hazardous and the XP loss will REALLY hurt.
