  Great!  When can you start?  These spammers
have been cluttering up this newsgroup for a
very long time.

  You mean there are *other* newsgroups out there,
somewhere?!!!

  I strongly suspect that you would not have
bothered to invest your time in such "research"
had you not objected to *what* he was saying,
as well as where he was saying it.
  The fact is that such remarks could have easily
worked their way into this newsgroup by using
Fischer as the subject, and by disguising the
message as part of a serious query into Fischer's
sanity, or lack thereof.  No small task, but it
could be done.
  Be that as it may, if you really are an anti-spam
man, shouldn't you begin by eliminating the most
objectionable spam, first?  It is very unlikely
that many readers worked their way through all
of that longwinded posting, and were thus
"contaminated" with objectionable (to some)
ideas.  Most readers undoubtedly moved on, as
soon as they realized they were reading non-
politically-correct anti-jewish propaganda.
  OTOH, what about posts which simply give a
handy link to click on (such as WILDsex.com),
whereupon the hapless reader may be
dissappointed to find only dull, boring porn, and
nothing whatever to read about _chess_?  Don't
forget to go after these guys, too.*     We lose
more readers that way...   ;-)

job.  Thanks.   ;-)
