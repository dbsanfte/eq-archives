/agreed on all points.
Yes, EQ was more the symptom, not the problem.  As divorce stories go....I
have one hell of an atypical whopper.
I have made good friends through the game.  Ironically, one of them, is
going in to business with me in my RL addiction....paintball.   I used to
run a field and store before the divorce, decided to re-open it.   This
guy....I met through a friend in EQ....and he was by far THE luckiest
character I have ever seen.  He would get ultra rare drops on the first
kill, get off the big killer AOE nuke when he had 3 hit points left, would
start talking to someone quitting the game, and they would give him all
their stuff.   I mean, this happened to him all the time.  He lives not to
far...and loves paintball, has cash, good business sense, and one hell of a
work ethic.
And, I have enjoyed reading your posts.  Perhaps Ill be a non playing poster
from now on.
