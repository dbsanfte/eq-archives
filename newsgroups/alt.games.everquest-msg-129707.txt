on behalf of the palestinians?  did he ever live among the palestinians?
did he ever go around and get signatures for his terrorist act?
don't let your pro-isreali ego get in the way of your reason.

motives are motives... it isn't justification for the killing of innocent
people.
just becuase something terrible happens doesn't mean you should ignore the
motives, no matter how unrelated to the actual crime it may be.
they were HIS motives.

he spent his money on an attack rather than helping people.  definitely a
immoral choice.  this is certain.
he's stupid as well as rash.. what's so surprising about that statement?

foolish and bruttally stupid?  i cited my sources.  my sources cite their
sources (ZMAG sources are listed at the bottom).
and you?  other neanderthals and their unsupported opinions?  here's a
lesson for you in simple terms a person of your ignorance may understand.
DEBATE = ARGUMENT + SUPPORT, SUPPORT = RESEARCH.
