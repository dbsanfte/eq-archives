All it says is that you should summarize at the top.  Doesn't say where 
to put your text (other than not at the top).  Of course if you don't 
summarize or include just enough of the message I guess you can put your 
reply anywhere in the message.  
I'm sorry, but this is very, very vague.  I've dealt with technical 
incompatabilities from different interpretations of RFCs many times, and 
in every case the RFC was about 100 times more clearly worded than this.  
In addition, this is not worded like most RFCs, and RFC != BCP.  
Otherwise we would all be using birds to transmit packets as described in 
RFC-2594 (which updates RFC-1149).
