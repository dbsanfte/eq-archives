Oh, but there most assuredly was.  As I stated, I'd go so far as to say that
it would be *IMPOSSIBLE* for a level 21 beastlord to hit for 80 with a 1h
weapon, and used game mechanics as my basis for that, as well as experience
with a character that uses a lot of the same weapons.  It's simply not
possible.  I remember my ranger enjoying around level 45 finally hitting for
some big numbers with a 1h weapon, and that was a wurmslayer, a 25 damage
weapon.  Find me a 25 damage weapon (has to be quite a bit higher actually,
but let's aim for 25) for a 21 beastlord to wield.
