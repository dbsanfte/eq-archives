I have no clue where people get the chivalry idea.  The rules of chivalry
were between the nobility.  Just about everyone else was benieth them in
that respect.  Then there is the religious fanatic on top of that.

With my druid I port for donations, and leave the amount up to the donator.
Many have ridden for free.  Oh well.  If I get enough to pay for my next
level of spells, I am happy.
