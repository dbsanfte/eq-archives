    Almost every night on Quellious. You have to wait for an opening, or be
like several mages on the server and do AoE mod rod to clear a spot. It
starts getting blocked at about 10:30-11 PM PST, and you start seeing spaces
open up at around 1:30 AM PST.

    Many people don't ignore the spam. Just by watching conversations and
debates in ooc I can see that. Personally I'm like you - I turn off ooc,
shout, and auction the moment I step into the zone. But lots of folks don't,
especially the ones that were used to it from
EC/GFay/insert_auction_zone_here.

    Most people don't use the most general features, and instead search for
specific items they have been told are "good". For example, instead of a
caster looking for all robes with +MANA, they'll look for all Froglok
Bonecaster's Robes because their friend told them that was a good robe to
wear. When you auction with links, people will click on the link, see your
item, and say "OMG that's so cool! I want that!" It's promoting brand
awareness.
