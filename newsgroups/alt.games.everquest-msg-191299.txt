It's not irrelevant, it is in fact directly forbidden by SOE's policies.

From the play nice policy

"2. You may not ninjaloot.

Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature 
without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are 
in attendance.

The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that 
carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being 
looted by the rightful owner."

The corpses of Mobs over level 55 last for 30 minutes, yet are open to
anyone after 2.  This does not mean that the people who killed it forfeit
rights to it, only that they are in the process of awarding loot/clearing
adds.  In the case of time constrained trials you can't afford to take
people out of the raid for sorting out loot during the trial.
