Yes yes, we saw this the last time you posted this. However, one can
only wonder how long it took for you to find a time when the
statistics favored you, since as I recall it took you *months* before
you posted it, and the newsgroup, as proven by google, tends to have a
slight edge to bottomposting. It stands to reason at some points,
especially when TomG is particularly active, that top posting would
edge ahead.

However since stats have been posted showing its not a top posting
group, and your stats can't be verified while ours came directly from
google, I'm afraid your case remains unproven.

You should stop lying about things like no one posting stats that
countered you, and that you've never top posted in the group, etc
etc... You wouldn't get called a liar if you didn't lie so much.


>You can swear now Mr Sisson.

No need. You still haven't proven me wrong.
