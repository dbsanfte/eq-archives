Or Necromancer.  Sadly, not many people really know that.

This is certainly a problem, same one clerics have at much much
lower levels since the addition of Temperence; why do the other
"lasts more than an hour" buffs have a level 46 restriction, but
if you want Twink level HP and AC its available to all that can
pony up a pair of peridot (one for the spell and one as a tip)? 
This is one area where bards really win out; their longest buff
lasts two minutes, hardly enough time to cross a zone, much less
complete an LDoN run.

I have to admit I haven't really done chanter charm much, group
or solo, chanters are so fragile.  As a bard, though, charm is my
meal ticket, my solo exp engine, my group "no its only 5 adds I
can still handle this" magic trick, and my "yeah, bard melee Does
suck, but if you need DPS my friend the Diseased Rat here will be
glad to pinch hit for me" all rolled into one.  Of course as a
bard I'm fully expecting all those things to break all the time,
I -have- to juggle cause very little I can do ever lasts more
than 18 seconds.

My enchanter relies much more on things working as expected, I
just thought that perhaps if all the chanter had to do was
concentrate on the charm angle he could actually do a pretty good
job of it.  Given that people were saying the "real" chanter jobs
(mez and slow) weren't needed at all in LDoN, heck, sounded like
a golden opportunity to try Plan B.  But I can't really claim it
works, I have no experience with trying it as a chanter in an
LDoN
