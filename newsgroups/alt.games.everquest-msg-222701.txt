Ahh... Ok sorry for the mix up... Been playing this game for almost 3
years now and still have not been to all the zones, LOL.

However, I wonder if the same stratagy would work. After all, some of
the Mobs mentioned in this zone are undead right? Or, there are mobs
undead in the zone that can be charmed to kill the other mobs? I think
this would be the best was to solo in this area but I speak from druid
experience with the plain of nightmare solo style (that fails alot for
me, I have to get alittle higher level then 53 I think to do that
well). For my druid though, there are only charmed pets to my disposal
or kiting, but it's hard to kite when alot of mobs my level range like
to summon (Run Run *SMACK* ~Stunned~ Run Run *SMACK* LOADING, PLEASE
WAIT...)      :)

What do you think? Will the charming stratagy work better then using
the summoned pet?
