I have a 56 mage friend that pulls with a lvl 1 dd spell and seems to work
well without generating unnecessary aggro.   In areas like Echo Caverns he
can pull one of the Kings of the Above and Below even though they sit on
thrones that are side by side.  I am not sure how this technique works on
higher level mobs but it seems to be effective so far.
