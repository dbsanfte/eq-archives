The why the HELL did you start an arguement about it? You are the
one who replied to what I was saying to someone else in this
thread....

There is no such button or link!!! Even searching the page for
the word "Patch" says "The text you have entered was not found"
.....

I will give you the benifit of the doubt that you subscribe to
crgaming and that that link/button is only available to
subscribers and you arent THINKING when replying...

...but it really looks like you are here trolling just to argue
and not to provide any constructive input.
