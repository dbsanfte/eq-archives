Actually I think it is very helpful, just like quarantining AOL users off on
their own server too...

: )

I always get a nervous twitch speaking to Mac users on the phone:

Them: "Is the Internet down?"
Moi: "No... Let me just take you over a few settings..."
Them: "I have a Mac - I don't need to worry about those."
Moi: *sigh*

Mac users are the second most difficult users to support, surpassed only by
Linux users. Clarification: Linux users who don't know enough to find their
own information or know enough to just ask for needed information. They both
share that special sort of arrogance that completely and utterly prohibits
even mentioning the idea the problem could be at their end, even when they
are so clueless as to not know what phone number their computer is dialing.

Them: "But it worked yesterday"
Moi: *silence as I find a hard object to bash my head against*

I think this site sums it up well: http://www.linuxisforbitches.com/
