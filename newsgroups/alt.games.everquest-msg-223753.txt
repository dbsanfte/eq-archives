Weird, I've been guilds where ae tl has been used regularly for leaving
raids for the last 2 years and never once heard anyone complain about
not having gotten the box. In a recent 3 guild mix up over the Emporer,
which happily our guild wasn't part of there was complaints of wizards
spamming ae tl but I didn't hear any complaints of anyone getting tl'd
out without getting the box, and there were 130 or more people there.
Maybe the lag in the bazaar can do wierd things but that's the first
time I've ever heard of it.
