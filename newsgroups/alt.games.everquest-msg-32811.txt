See Our views are not exactly opposite. Communism in it's ideal form
doesn't have a bureaucracy or a scumbag leader. That part is supposed
go away after the "temporary dictatorship" dissolves and ideally the
members of said  temporary dictatorship weren't corrupt. That being
said I completely concur with you. in the following. It has never been
done right nor will it unless mankind suddenly becomes more
enlightened and less greedy. 

Call me silly but there is no way that a doctor and a teacher should
be making less money per year (and this is coming from a canadian bear
in mind) than someone who straps a pair of metal blades to his feet
and skates around for 20 minutes out of an hour, or (from a
prowrestling fan .. yes it is a choreographed soap opera for adults) a
guy or gal who throws on tights and pretends to get beat up.

Ideally the incentive to work comes from an "esprit de corps" and
being able to do a job you love but you are right where there is a
safety net that catches everyone regardless of why they fell people
will fal just to lay in the hammock
