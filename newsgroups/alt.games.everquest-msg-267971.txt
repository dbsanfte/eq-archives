It's documented in the PDF manual that came with the open beta:

	Unlearning Trade Skills

	You can unlearn trade skills by opening up your Skills window
	(hotkey K or click on the Skills tab from the Character Info
	panel).  Then click on the trade skill. At the bottom of the
	Skills window is a crossed out circle next to the selected
	trade skill. Click on that to unlearn the skill. Unlearning a
	trade skill frees up a slot for you to learn a new trade skill,
	but it also erases all skill points you have accumulated in that
	skill. If you later relearn the trade skill, you will not resume
	it at your last skill level, but must start from the bottom again.

I also think I heard how do this a million times on the general chat
channel when playing the game.
