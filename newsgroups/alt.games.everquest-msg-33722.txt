Well this is more of a convenience for people 
besides kids also. For example I used a check card
check account just for EQ, had no overdraft
protection on it since I always made sure I had like
20 or 15 bucks in it. I forgot to get money in there soon enough and
eq was charged and my account went like 90 cents over costing
me like 35 bucks or something and they had also closed the account
by the time I got there. I said screw you and walked out. But now I
have to get another visa checking account at some bank and that may
show up so I might have to go back to that first one and pay it
anyway.

Are these game cards out yet? Cause I'd certainly buy one if they
were.
