First, you can leave your MP3s where they are now...you dont have to move 
them to get it to work.

Check out http://www.tc.umn.edu/~prat0088/resources.htm for instructions 
on how to set it up...For some reason, the site doesnt mention that you 
need to have Winamp running in the background when you start EQ. Also, it 
currently doesn't have full playlist control; the only ones I've been 
able to use are: 

/note winamp play (to start playing your music)
/note winamp next (skip to the next song)
/note winamp stop (stop the music)

The site says full playlist control will be in the next version, but it 
also says it was supposed to be released at the end of July...
