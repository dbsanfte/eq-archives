If your're enjoying yourself, (and it sounds like you are) and you are
fully aware of the limitations you'll encounter at higher levels and
don't mind that (sounds like this is the case also) then there's
absolutely nothing wrong and you can tell them to go eat shit and die.

If you do decide later that you want to get into the high levels and
still solo, though, I'll tell ya right now that you're in the wrong
class.
