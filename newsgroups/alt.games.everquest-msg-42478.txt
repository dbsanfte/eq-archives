Here is EverQuestsDaBest's stupid-post modus operandi:

He picks some little fact about Everquest, asks some stupid question about
it, and sits back and watches.  If he didn't know the answer to this
question about the Dragoon, why'd he put his character's religion in the
text?  I for one don't go around saying "Oh I play a level 34 agnostic
bard".

Please people, quit replying to his inane posts.
