The only reason I know of that Druids are not valued healers, is beacuse
when PoP came out they all started wanting groups for the good xp instead of
sloing. And these druids had not seen a group in 20 levels or more and were
very bad at healing and even worse at pulling agro :(

Although I did once have a druid that got splattered 2 times in my group and
got agro countless times because he laned a backup heals, I guess the dot
and other stuff they cast cause too much agro and the tiny heal she threw in
was the last straw.....please note the 2 times she died were heals while I
was totally oom.
