I was just wondering how EQ1 worked with all the expansions and if EQ2 will
go the same way.

I'm kinda worried that once I hit 50 (It will be awhile!), I will be left
with a game where everyone is lvl 50 and there is nothing to do.

How does this stuff work in EQ1? Are there simply no lower level players in
EQ1, is everyone lvl 50? I kinda like the whole character progression and
really dont fancy being stuck on the same level without anything to aim at.
I of course plan of creating new characters so at least I will have that.

I'm not even sure how new content works. Is it simply adding new locations
and equipment? Has EQ1 changed much from it's initial release?
