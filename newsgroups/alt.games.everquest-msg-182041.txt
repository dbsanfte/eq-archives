Actually, he's trying to use his Classic edition account key which 
doesn't have the expansions enabled. He needs to use the Gold account KEY 
to register those expansions with the Classic account he has already set 
up. 

The gold can be used to either "upgrade" an existing account (which is 
what he needs to do) or to start a new account.
