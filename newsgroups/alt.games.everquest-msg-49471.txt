I don't type all that well or very fast.  So I tend to shorten
things in game to speed up the process.  I do it when I offer help
and when I ask.  I wrie things like plz thanx, u r welcome all the
time.  This saves time and does the job.  I do alwasy say please and
use the good manners I was taught.  It always amazes me when people
in this group get all up tight over an abbbreviations, player names
and other in game things that are just different strokes for
different folks.  Just to be helpful to all of you  Everquest is a
GAME.  Please try to not get to self-righteous and overly serious
about it.  ABove all plz enjoy your self in game, and thnx for
reading my post.
