Ok I've been reading all these posts about EQ2 and I'm a little freaked out.
(ok, so I DON'T have a real life) anyway I suppose all we can do at this
point is speculate, but I am wondering:

Is it going to be a completely new game?  It seems from the way it is
described that this is the intention because of the advancement of the
storyline and changes to Norrath.   If it is only an expansion or upgrade
this would not work unless everyone had the upgrade. OK-so assuming it is a
completely new game-what about:

Tranferring characters-don't see how this could be done-does this mean that
everyone starts over?  How depressing.

Will regular EQ still exist-can't imagine them axing it with so many people
still playing, but over time I imaging people will     leave for the new
game.  Will the old EQ just fade away over time?  Will Freeport become a
ghost town?  Will Verant continue to tweak, upgrade and fix the old game
when they have a new one to deal with?

What will this do to the incentive to play right now?  Why strive to keep
advancing and obtaining gear now, when it may all be for nothing in the near
future?

Why have they been making, and continue to make BIG changes to the current
game if it will all be scrapped soon in place of EQ2?

What about guilds? Looks like they would all have to be started over just
like new players.  Guess it would be up to players to cooridinate movement
to new servers.  What if all my friends move to different servers?  OH
NOOOOOO!

Not to mention all the questions I have about actual game content......
No universal bank?
Pack horses?
100 levels?
Breaking gear?

Oh the humanity!!!!!

I hope I can sleep tonight!
