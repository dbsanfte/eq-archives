 There's a difference between taunting and drawing aggro.  As a monk I
can draw agro but I can't taunt. I'd make that lower than 9 myself.

 Technically it's 50% unless, I guess, you do the removal of the +HP
equipment technique. It goes up to 70% when you get a 201 skill which is
attainable at 51.

 Love my Bo! The original 5/8 solo rating is probably fairly accurate.
Like most classes a Monk can solo but they'd rather not.
