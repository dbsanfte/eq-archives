Just one note, Most people I know pronouns SNES as Ess-ness.  I'm not
sure if that makes it an acronym or not.  

I would point out that although Acronyms are Abbreviations,
Abbreviations are not acronyms.

I would posit, that we have gotten so far into the semantic discussion,
that any discussion of politeness vs(pronounced Versus)  brevity has
ended.

You forgot to mention that the SS under Hitler was also an Abbreviation.
