I dont give to beggars either.  Ever.  I have given money away though.
It was to someone auctioning "Young Rogue looting to earn some money
running errands."

I was stunned as I so RARELY see people who are willing to EARN thier
pay.  I didnt even have an errand.  I just sent him on a Wild Goose
Chase.  I sent him from EC to the FP bank to deliver 20pp to a friend
who was "logging on his main".  I gave him 25pp.  When he got there
and couldnt find it I told him he could keep it for trying to earn a
decent living rather than expecting others to hand it to him.

Like with many things, it is in the approach.  Ask me if I can spare a
weapon or some PP and the answer is "inspect and read my bio" (it says
as the last line "And Beggars?  NO!"  Now if someone were to come up
to me and want to know if there was anything they could do to earn a
few pp to buy their next spells?  I am sure I have SOMETHING you can
do for me.  I have even designed minor quests for players to obtain
things like Velium weapons and Lumberjack Caps and such.

But GIVE you something because you ask?  No.
