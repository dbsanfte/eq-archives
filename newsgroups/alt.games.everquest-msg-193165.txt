One of the top ten rules for Usenet states that I shouldn't reply to
your type of message, but I'm going to anyway.

I have strong dislike for rude SOBs like you. In game & RL.   I
certainly don't need to join you in a group to determine what type of
person you are.  You've already made that very clear by the language
you use.   I'd imagine that you have very few friends in EQ & RL.  You
sound like a loner.  You'll probably never figure out why other people
don't like you.

I only popped into this newsgroup to post a few messages about a
problem I was having with my pet.  I wanted to see if others were
having the same problem and to find out the best way to report the
problem.   I don't normally read this newsgroup nor post to it.  You
somehow misread what I posted  & then bashed me for not stating my EQ
toon name.   Is there really any value to posting ones EQ character
name or server.  I mean really, who cares?  And, believe it or not,
you can be rich & still get the short end of the stick.  This thread
relates to a question of fairness in looting, not rich vs poor.

While here, I thought I might be able to help out someone who asked a
relatively simple question.  People like you never help others.   You
only come here to flame.  For some odd reason you get your jollies
that way.  I have no use for rude SOBs like you.
