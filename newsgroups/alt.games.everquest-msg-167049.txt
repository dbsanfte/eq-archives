<snip my post>

The picture didn't show, actually :(  said it couldn't be displayed (seems
like they removed it, as it wasn't a broken link).  the picture at
'http://www.guru3d.com/tech/geforcefx/?PHPSESSID=03f6536695d5179fb60ea37da1e
f2862' doesn't seem to large, if that is what you were talking about.. I
remember reading one of the cards needed to plug itself into the main power,
might that be the one that link was supposed to point to?  Thanks for
letting me know about the 9700, the more I read about it the better it
sounds, but I still think I would like to wait for the new GeForce.. one of
the best things about NVIDIA is they really keep up with the drivers.. I've
found that I don't like the way ATI does it.. any hardware more than a year
old is hard to find, kind of like they want to make you upgrade by hiding
the drivers.  Of course you can find them, but they're just not as
accessible and they aren't updated as frequently.
