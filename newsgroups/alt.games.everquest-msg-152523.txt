}Having a bazaar *at all* is certainly better than having nothing.
}However, the consignment shop approach seems far superior.

I'd agree that it would be superior for me, personally, but it does have 
two drawbacks:

1)  By not using the merchant code, it would completely disallow 
participation by people who can't use the new UI.  Currently, they can buy 
from bazaar vendors, but cannot sell or search them.

2)  It would lose some of the roleplaying realism.  As implemented, it 
reminds me somewhat of actual bazaars I've seen in foreign countries, and 
that's kinda cool.  Well, except for 90% of the merchants not being there 
and the lack of haggling, but in my experience, most EQ players had no 
idea how to really haggle anyway.
