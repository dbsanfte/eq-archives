At 32 you could probably find some good groups in the Overthere.   I've never
had any trouble finding a group.  And if you ever end up with 2 druids in a
group, each of you take a different role:  one buffs and sows while the other
heals.  If there isn't a chanter one of you root the adds.  
Oh, and ignore the trolls....
