True... but then you must ask yourself why he keeps cutting his hand..
and why after your 10,000th bandage that... while he loves you like
family, the damn thing still hasn't healed :>.

Well... I really detest the Exposition.. er.. Wayfarers...
Brotherhood. It was one fucked up story concept to introduce a brand
new set of characters whose entire duties consisted of sitting around
and spewing exposition every time you did something in expansion.

True. It'll happen like every other advancement. Some company will
make a game based on a new tact.. get some market share.. and SoE will
adapt EQ or EQ2 to handle the advancement.

Its the Microsoft playbook and they'll follow it.. step by step. Why
pay to generate unique material that may not fly when you can just
borrow something proven from your competitors?
