I'm sorry, if I'm talking to a Verant rep in the Verant Online Chatroom...
the comment that it's "MY" ISP... is, uh... stupid.

When my ISP disconnects me... it disconnects me from everything for the
duration of the disconnect.

Now if my ISP knocked me off a server in a hic-up... I'll be back on the
server in a matter of a minute... if I can't get back on the server... and
I'm in the chat... and a VI rep tells me <you know the rest>.

On this topic, I was just telling my ranger pet that SOE/VI should provide a
standalone server status utility (like EQStatus) that tells server and or
zone status (up/down/locked/unable to determine).  Populations would be
nice... but I don't ACTUALLY need to know how many people are on my
server... in the same zone, camping the same thing, sure... but world
population?  I don't actually care.
