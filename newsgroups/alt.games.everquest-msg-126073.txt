Because I happen to view it differently than you do?  Because I think

Really?  Why is crap more offensive than shit?  

If I were to turn around and see a steer charging for me (actually has
happened to me) and were to yell "Gah!" it would be inoffensive, but
if I were to yell "Shit!" it would be offensive?  Despite that they
have exactly the same meaning in that context?

I understand the people might be offended by it.  I don't agree they
the SHOULD be offended by it.

>Refusing to recognize this can only be seen as rude and selfish. 

As opposed to expecting people to tailor their thoughts to suit you?

I use the word shit.  The word has done no damage to you unless you
CHOOSE to let it offend you.  Being offended is a choice.  You don't
have to be.  It's not an assault.  I haven't taken any options away
from you.

>Does it foster ill will more often than not? Yep. Say to a passerby,

Part of effective conversation is understanding your audience.  If
it's important to engage this person in conversation, then I probably
won't use any 'harsh' language with him.  At least until I get to know
them and their mind on the subject.

>This is a ridiculous exercise in futility. Congratulations on getting

Your choice as to whether or not you're gonna get worked up.

I'm sure she'll be disappointed to know you disapprove of her beliefs.
