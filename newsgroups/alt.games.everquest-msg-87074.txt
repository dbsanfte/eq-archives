Yes, but:

  a) I'm proposing a change to the game engine anyway, and

  b) I'm not suggesting that the loot drop be determined by
     how long the mob has been *up*, I'm suggesting that the
     loot it gets *when it spawns* is determined by how long
     it has been since the mob was last triggered (or died,
     which would work almost the same way).

So it would still be a "spawn, itemize, and forget" mechanism,
not one which would involve rearranging loot when the mob dies.
