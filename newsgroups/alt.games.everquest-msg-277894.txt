My son bought EQ platinum, to upgrade his eq gold account. He also had
a second, non-eq equipped login to the everquest.com website. When he
entered to code for the eq platinum, he put it into his non-eq login,
which he really didnt want to do. He asked me if he can switch the key;
I figured, no way they would do that, and that it was off to best buy
with another $20 for another key. But he did the live chat thing a few
days later, explained what happened, had to provide billing info for
both accts and they did switch it. I was pleasantly surprised.
