I don't have LDoN, but the LD's and not being able to zone have plagued
me to the point where I have canceled my EQ account. I have spent this
week rebooting my system more than I have played, by far, so have given
up on EQ. I emailed their technical support people and got the answer
that it was my ISP. When I informed them it was the same on both a dial
up and a T1 line, same answer. I program in the telecommunications
field, and have had some of our techies check out both the line at work
and at home with some pretty sophisticated equipment, and all is fine on
my end. I have zero online problems elsewhere, just with EQ. I get the
distinct feeling Sony is sluffing me off..... Just a feeling, because as
we all know, sometimes terse emails give an impression that was never
intended.

These problems materialized with the patch prior to LDoN and got much
worse after that release. I had very few problems prior to that. It
doesn't take rocket science to make some kind of a link between these
occurrences! However, I am not ruling out the possibility that there is
a problem on my end, though I do see others with similar problems
posting here. It seems their problems cropped up under similar
circumstances to mine.

So for now, good-bye EQ. If you're reading this Koscha, post a time
you'll be on and I'll return the items you gave me on FV!!!
