Ok, I just ding'd L15 with my pally. About to get my 2nd set of spells. My
concern is that I *THINK* I have enuff $$$ to buy all the L15 spells. I
would like to get them all, you never know when you might need any one of
them. My main concern is what should I train in to reduce the # of fizzles.
I get ALOT of fizzles.
During melee, my Blind or Yaulp tends to fizzle quite a bit. I have used
these every chance I get, every once in a while, I see "You have increased
your skill in Divination". When I go for some training, I see Divination,
but not the other casting disciplines. Do I have to transcribe the spells
into my book first to see the other casting disciplines? Should I just save
the points for when I get to L20 for Double Attack or another of the melee
skills?

Anyone have any feelings/opinions about this? Thanks in advance.
