The weird thing is that my other comp is also behind the same ICS, and works
flawlessly... i'm going to try some of the other options suggested here,
like IRQ settings, LAN drivers, Energy savings, and swap file....  The other
comp works perfectly.

Investing in a hardware router is defenitly something i had planned, but
since i will be moving from NL (220 volts) to the US next year (110 volts) i
have decided to to buy any more electrical appliances....
