Maybe this will help - similar situation.  Was trying to log on with
my win2k laptop earlier this week.  Right before the character
selection screen it would reboot the machine!  I finally, in
desperation (sad, huh?) deleted the eqclient.ini file.  

It worked, but I had some setup work to do again.

Got me as to if it will work for you, but you might want to delete
yours as well (after backing it up somewhere...)
