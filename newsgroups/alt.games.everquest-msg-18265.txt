The item itself was overpowered.
Insta-cast invis which is basically an insta-faction reset for 95% of
the mobs in Velious.

I've got SKs and Necros who are able to bank in Rivervale these days
because of this item.

Three classes were given a self-only invis spell with a fixed
duration:  Enchanter, Wizards and Druids.  SKs and Necros actually
have it better than these three classes.
