	He he I'll do the cleric part:

	Follow the group to the spot the monsters will be lured to.
(That's "camp").  Sit down.  Watch all the red bars in the group
window.  When one gets almost all the way to the left click it and
cast a heal spell.  Be careful not to click the green bars because
then you'll heal the pet instead and that wont help.  After the heal
casts and/or the target dies anyway remember to sit down so you'll
run out of mana a little later.
