You keep forgetting: George W. Bush hasn't cut your taxes, he's forced
you to borrow money.

When you buy things using your credit card, and don't immediately pay
it off, you end up paying MORE for that item, compared to just paying
in cash (in most circumstances).

"Tax and spend" is much better than "borrow and spend" under most
circumstances (with exceptions, such as buying real estate).  Sorry,
but republicans remain the fiscally irresponsible party with their
"borrow and spend" approach to economics.

Just because you have a high credit card limit doesn't mean you're
wealthy.

I'm for increasing taxes at least enough to negate the deficit, and
not allowing the U.S. government to use that money for anything else.

I agree, though I *do* think Kerry would get much closer to having a
balanced budget than George W. Bush.  George W. Bush is pressing for
yet another tax cut for the wealthy.  That's just wrong, but it'll
"buy" him all the "sucker" voters who actually think they're getting
some free money.

But, as we both know, George W. Bush will get re-elected, so this
speculation probably isn't terribly valuable.  Kerry will never get
the chance to even try.  Which is sad, because we already know based
on first-hand experience that Bush sucks.  Why it is that America is
going to re-elect a known failure is beyond me...
