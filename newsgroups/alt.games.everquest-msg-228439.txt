What are you calling the mid ? A warrior starts to outdamage every other
(non pure melee) class at level 15...they now have dual wield / double
attack.

A clerics melee is horrible compared to a warrior, only comparable up to
level 13, the warrior then pulls ahead....at around level 20ish, there is
little point in a cleric meleeing as the will do awful damage, better off
medding for a nuke.

When my brother read your above statement, he kinda laughed (he plays a
65cleric), he said clerics melee worse than EVERYONE apart from
shamans....he even said enchanters where above them, whether he meant that
or not, who knows.

The long cast time / refresh of nukes makes them bad damage dealers also,
over time a warrior will still do more damage.

I recall a parse from a time equipped cleric, who went 'all out dps' and
managed about 60dps average (which actually, isnt that bad, just horrible
compared to most / any other class including warriors).
