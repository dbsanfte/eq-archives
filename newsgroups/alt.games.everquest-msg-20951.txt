Yep.  Just make sure you're not moving when you drink it.  I think some of
the potions were set so that they could be interrupted.  I know that some
of the dropped items can be, I've had Crystalline Silk Nets interrupted
before.  Other than that, I really like those things.  As a Magician
soloing, those nets are almost a "Get out of death Free" card.  If the
pet's about to die, back up, hit the net, and start casting a new pet while
the mob is glued down.  Or just blast it, if it's low enough.  I'm not very
good at "chain pet" killing, so the nets work out pretty well.
