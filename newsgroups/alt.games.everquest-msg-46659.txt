While Druids are excellent solo'ers, they come NOWHERE near the
soloing ability of Necromancers.  

Necro's are solo gods.

And druids at high levels don't do much of anything with any great
skill.  A druid is a useful member of a exp grind group, but for raid
level encounters there isn't anything they can do well enough to
justify they're place in the raid.
