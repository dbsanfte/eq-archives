I think what you're seeing is wandering mobs repopping.  The zones
try to maintain a certain number (or perhaps a range) of wandering
mobs.  If some of the mobs get killed, the zone spawns new ones.
I'm not entirely sure, but suspect that for the most part the new
spawns are randomly chosen from among the list for the zone (not
necessarily all equally likely, of course).

So if you're looking for a particular mob, and it's not in the zone,
start killing whatever IS in the zone.  Whatever you kill will be
replaced by new stuff, and each new mob has some chance of being the
one you want.  The more people in the zone killing random junk, the
more new stuff gets spawned, and the more chances you have of the
one you want showing up.

That's why, e.g., in East Karanas you'll hear people reminding each
other to kill the snakes and other nearby stuff while farming spiders.
It's not that killing snakes specifically spawns spiders (at least, I
don't think that's the case); it's that killing more of anything means
more spiders will spawn.
