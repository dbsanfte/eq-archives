I'd imagine this was done because of the OoW AA "Origin" and all the high
elves that have done Tunare/PoG raids.  Probably not the only place
something like this changed.  In fact, unrelated to the origin AA for
obvious reasons, all of the mobs in PoTime(A) became untargetable with OoW. 
I'm thinking this was done to stop people from grinding there.  Why they'd
worry about it now puzzles me, as my guild has had people grinding there
that showed up early to Time raids for a good while.

I'd imagine there's a good chance some guards in Rivervale, Kelethin and
Neriak were changed.  Unlikely that anything would be changed in Qeynos,
Freeport, Oggok or Grobb.
