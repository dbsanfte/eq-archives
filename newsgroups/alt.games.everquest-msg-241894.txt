I think they keep adjusting thre environment efects of the zones. I notice
twilight sea keep changing, from dark to light, to foggy, to clear.
All in a zone that has no day/night cycle.
FG is wierd too. Sometimes pitch black, other times quite bright.
Umbral plains is a joke too. BRIGHT light, and a bright white haze. Not very
umbral.

No biggie tho. I do wish they would fix up falling through walls in dungeons
tho.
