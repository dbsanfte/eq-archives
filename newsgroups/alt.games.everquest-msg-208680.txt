I've read somewhere you can get down by walking backwards towards it, or
"walk" (click off run) on it while looking down.
Never tried it myself, levitate works good enough and besides most drops
aren't that bad for damage. At least not as long as you're not encumbered.

Getting up is easy, walk against it and look up. Make sure levitate is off
though, it somehow screws up climbing ladders.
