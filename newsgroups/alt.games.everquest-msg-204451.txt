What's involved in this? I saw someone last night saying they're casting 
it and am curious of the details.

When I logged on last night at about 1:40am I had a C3 that I still had 
from when I previously played, and estimated I'd had it about an hour 
before logging on. Well, I kept waiting for the effect to expire, but it 
never did. I leveled up and was about to go to bed at about 3:20am. I 
went to the Bazaar and set up shop, and checking on my logs it shows 
that C3 expired at like 4:38.

Not including the previous hour of usage, this thing lasted 3 hours. 
That's 4 hours total. How'd it last so long?
