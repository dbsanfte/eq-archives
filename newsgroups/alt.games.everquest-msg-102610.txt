Calling her loony is perhaps a bit cruel, I would agree. I am sure she
is distraught over this. I am a mother myself and I know I would be
devastated if something like this happened to my daughter. OTOH, I don't
think it would ever cross my mind in similar circumstances to run out
and sue a video game company. EQ has only been in existence, what, 3
yrs. or so? My impression, based on her comments in the article, is that
this young man had had emotional problems for far longer than that. It's
all about accepting responsibility for what you create and my instinct
here says the mother in this case didn't do all she could and now can't
face up to her own failure. Therefore, she looks to blame an outside
agency. And, yes, children do sometimes just die. Ask any parent who has
lost a child to SIDS or miscarriage. It is tragic, certainly, and rare;
but it *does* happen.
