*takes a look around*

Um - I do not think extermination of the species is going to occur very soon
because of some people choosing not to breed.

It's called a vasectomy.

Actually it was included in the very first comment I made, and reiterated in
all subsequent posts bar one.
By the way - the first comment I made which you obviously did not read was:

"Like that pathetic mother whose son suicided so decided it had everything
to
do with EQ and of course nothing to do with herself. Let me see, now how
much of an influence is 18 odd years of bringing up a kid from an age where
they don't even know if it is wrong or right to smear shit over their faces
and play with their pecker all day? Now for the kicker - how much are
genetics involved in the chances of developing mental illness? So - Little
Johnny  smokes a 10 gauge and of course it is <nothing> to do with the
parents... Of course not."
