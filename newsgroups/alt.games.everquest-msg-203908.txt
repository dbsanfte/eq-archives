Not hard to do, start in Commonlands or Nek forest and kill orcs. KILL
KILL KILL. Soon you will be dubious to the freeport Guards. You can
also use invis and do a couple faction quests, one is in EFP, where
you deliver notes in WFP, and they can be done with invis. There is an
often overlooked Orc Pick quest, where yo get a lottery ticket back,
but it is faction goodness.

No matter what steer clear of the Monk guild, they have no sense of
humor.

Not too bad, just try getting there without a port. :-)

Besides being a smelly city, there is little to offer anyone. I have
tried getting dubious there, and I am convinced it is like Felwithe
faction, not possible. Now I hunt Brandl.

Oh yeah, Dwarves and Elves look good when they are smoking. Watchman
Halv is great exp.
