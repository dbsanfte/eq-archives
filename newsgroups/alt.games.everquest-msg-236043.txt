I think it is a little sad that a person cannot feel freedom to do something
way out there without people accusing him of evil.  Nothing he mentioned in
the site (that I saw) was actually evil.  I dont consider arranging breeding
patterns to be necessarily evil, as long as it is consensual.  My only
problem with it is the fear that it would develop into a jim jones thing.
And logically, I have no basis in statistics for a belief that it would
*probably* do so.
