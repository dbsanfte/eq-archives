The wonderful joys of the "Attractive Nuisance" laws.  It is the owners
responsibility to secure anything that may be a hazard.  I remember reading
about a guy who rode his shiny chromed everything motorcycle to a fast food
restaurant and while he was inside a 5 or 6 year old kid decided to try to climb
on his bike.  You can guess what happens from here.  The kid pulls it over on
himself and the owner gets in trouble.  Make sense don't it?
