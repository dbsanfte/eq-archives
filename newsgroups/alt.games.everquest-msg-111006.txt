Now wouldn't it have been nice if BT had simply explained that to me?  Well,
nice for me, I mean.  I'd have been happy with that.  Instead, once of their
tech support operators tells me something about a card locking up but can't
give me any further details, and the person I spoke to on my next call
denied this fervently.  "Oh, no, I don't know who's told you that but..."

What I HAVE noticed is that, while BT themselves have been keen to help,
their engineering contractors have been completely useless in terms of
providing information.  Not only was End User here kept completely in the
dark throughout a MONTH without a connection, but it seems BT tech support
knew very little more than I did.

Thank you to PIPEX for somehow obtaining this information and posting it,
because as far as I was concerned I would have had more luck getting hold of
state secrets.
