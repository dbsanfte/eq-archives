Read your own post. You postulate malice and conspiracy where
inability to control the Internet and your system configuration are
almost certainly to blame. Then, rather than allowing yourself to
believe that there might be something wrong with your machine's
configuration, you claim that it couldn't possibly be a driver problem
because you've tried some unspecified combination of drivers and,
after all, you're a professional software developer and couldn't
possibly be wrong about this.

You can be wrong. You are wrong. And, you give professional developers
a bad name when you demonstrate overweening arrogance in the face of
your own inability to adequately troubleshoot a problem.
