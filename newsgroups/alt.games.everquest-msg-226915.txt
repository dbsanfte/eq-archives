Odd the timing that you posted this because I was contemplating on
writing a post titled something like: Are Druids really useful these
days?  It wasn't going to be a troll post.  I was going to ask the
question because I have a friend that has a druid and he's having a
tough time getting into groups at Level 51.  A few nights ago I was in
a pick up group in the PoD and I saw my friend online.  When I asked
the group if my druid friend could join they laughed.  Well, I didn't
literally hear them laugh but I could tell by their group tells that
they didn't think very highly of druids.

Then I started thinking about it.  What can Druids really offer in the
50+ game in PoP.  Not a whole hell of a lot when you think about it. 
As you pointed out, PoP has made Druid porting pretty much useless. 
The only time I ask a Druid for a port is to get to Stonebrunt Mtns. 
Their heals are not all that great.  Get a cleric with KEI and forget
the backup healer role a druid can play.  Damage shield?  Whoop de
doo...  Snares?  Other classes can handle that and add more to a
group.  DoT's?  I'd rather have a Necro in my group.  Direct Damage
spells, I'll take the Wizard every time.  Resistances and stat buffs? 
I'd rather have a Shaman and a Bard.

Personally, I like Druids in dungeons for their evac's.  These days,
it seems that Druids are only good for powerlevelling lower level
characters.  It's too bad because pre-PoP I always wanted a Druid in
my group.  Of course, pre-PoP I was level 30.

I think the Druid class needs to be addressed to some degree.  Sure,
they are a soloing class.  However, Necro's and Beastlords are also
soloing classes and they can add alot in terms of damage.  Perhaps
Druids over the years have been the beneficiaries of a lot of good
spells to make them effective soloer's between levels 1-50.  However,
I'd like to see changes to make them more useful in the end game, even
if it's one or two new spells.
