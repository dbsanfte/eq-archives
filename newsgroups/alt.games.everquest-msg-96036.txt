    I'm glad I don't drink when I'm at the keyboard. That would have been
awful to clean up.

    You forgot the REAL fun one, failing the bits. Messes up all your
stacks, makes a mess of your inventory. It's even worse when you're powering
up a tradeskill where you get part of the ingredients back on failure (vials
for Poison Making), or other assorted trash (bottles in Brewing). And as
someone else pointed out, Heady Kiolas are worse than bits. Much, much, much
worse.

    If you're a real tradeskiller your stuff isn't very good anyways. Now
that you know firsthand how bad it can be, I'm sure your respect for Tiru
and her patience has increased.
