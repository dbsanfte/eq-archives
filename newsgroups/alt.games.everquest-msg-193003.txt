Then why do we have eqatlas, eqtrader, alakazham (sp?) and others. Is

The game is really what you want to make of it. If someone wants to
learn everything first hand, then they obviously will not read this
newsgroup, or any fan/cheat webpages.

But for some of us, it is just a game to relax and stuff all this hard
work crap that requires months of mental work. 

I die enough in the game anyway. That is enough risk as it is.
