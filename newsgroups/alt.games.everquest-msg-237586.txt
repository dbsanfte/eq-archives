Keep in mind that only certain religions dictate that belief in God is
required.  I believe in God, but were I to disbelieve tomorrow and become
a strong atheist the rest of my life, I don't think there would be any
'divine consequences'.

I am of the opinion that faith is strictly optional and often damaging,
that there is a god, and that organized religion is dangerous bullshit
that'll lead to millions, if not billions, more needless deaths on this
planet.
