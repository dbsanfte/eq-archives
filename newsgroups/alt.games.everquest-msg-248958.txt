}1. You don't have either Trials or AD: you can be vflagged into HoHb

}I've heard its possible you can't vflag into HoHb if you're already
}being vflagged into HoH, but I can't say for sure if that's true or
}not, since most people doing MM are 62 and over.

I can verify that you -can- vflag to hohb, if you're already vflagged to 
hoha.  Of course, the poor 58 SK who did that this last weekend went LD 
for the entire time MM's planar projection thingy was up...
