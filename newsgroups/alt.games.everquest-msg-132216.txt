No, He doesn't have to be made of anything.

That is the whole point. When you get down to
trying to explain the nature of God... all bets
are off.

It is not possible to assign human or natural
properties to Him, with any accuracy. He is not
subject to any of the laws which may govern our
universe.

Or so a theologian might say.
