Well, I've been perusing the Bazaar for a while, so I got a pretty
good idea of where to go with my equipment (basically whatever has the
highest AC for less than 20k, or less than 10k if there isn't much
difference) so I't just a matter of time before I get the upgrades. I
really don't want to buy any more intermidiate upgrades. What he is
waering right now, is the best items I could find for less than 500pp
per slot. In most cases they were a great deal cheeper than 500pp a
slot. Have been focusing on AC more than anything else. My shaman can
buff him over 100 points on STR and DEX, and about 60 points on AGL
and STA. So when properly buffed, he is maxed in STR, a few points shy
of maxed in DEX, and has over 200 in AGL and STA.

I'm going to buy high AC pieces with stats wherever possible, then aug
them all with resists. Should do just fine. My next target is a
Wind-Worn Breastplate, which I have seen for just under 10k before.

Thank you very much for the offer of help in that regard though. =)

I can't bring myself to do it. =( I really hate faction hits. The only
faction I have been able to bring myself to ruin has been Freeport
Millita, and that's only because it improves the Pally and Cleric
faction in Freeport.

Actually I like to take time and raise faction when I can. My Oger
Warrior, can actually freely roam most of Kaladim now.

I did spend some time in the basement though hacking up Gobbies.

Yeah, I checked that place out. Been meaning to for a long while. Way
back before I quit EQ for the first time, I wanted to see the combine
ruins, but never made it there. Recently went there and marveled at
the huge spires for about 15 minutes.

I was pulling to the north side of Karnors which was pretty good exp,
then moved into Burning Woods. Both were good for 2Box PLing.

I also found that the zone line to Frontier Mountains in The Overthere
has significantly higher level mobs than the Skyfire zone.

My warrior is 43 now, so most of the stuff in the open air areas or
Kunark and Velious are becoming DB, which isn't so good for PLing.

I think I'm going to focus on the LoY zones until I can't get exp from
the mobs anymore. Particualrly the Luggald Temple in Dulak side but
the spawn times seem to be very low, which means that you have to
progress deeper into the zone to get more mobs, but the mobs deeper in
become much harder to pull single...

I'm sure I'll think of something.

Maybe head to Cobalt Scar to make some money.

Thanks for the assistance. =)
