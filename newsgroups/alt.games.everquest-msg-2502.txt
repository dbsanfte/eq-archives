I have always been the opposite.  I would be the one that was OK while my
guildmates where "lagged".  I have been in Hate when all but 5 us went LD.
When over 80% of the people go LD,  I don't see how it could be those 30+
peoples fault and not VI or one of VI's vendors.

Lag and LD is the reason I deleted my bard.  Some classes are more lag/LD
tolerant than others.  The Bard is the least and the Warrior is the most
(followed close by all pet classes).
