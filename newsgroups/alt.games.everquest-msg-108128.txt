Ben, did ya notice in the very beginning of the post he says, 'de rogue'?

}[top post corrected]
}Or enchanter, or troll, or ogre, or evil worshipping human, erudite,
}gnome... (and I think agnostic human monks start ok in OT also)

Agnostic gnomes are also fine.  At least, my agnostic gnome enchanter 
started at apprehensive with no alliance or illusion,  kindly now. :)

Rogues and bards with the DE illusion mask will also be ok, as will anyone 
under the influence of a Ball of Golem Clay.

To my knowledge, the places you can lose Outpost faction (VenrillSathir) 
are:

Kaesora
Karnor's Castle
Ogres in Timorous Deep
Scorpions in Overthere

I am not sure if you take VS hits in Howling Stones, and would rather like 
to know...
