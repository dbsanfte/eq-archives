You missed the key spell line that mages whine about when the subject
of beastlords comes up: Slow.  Of course, my opinion was "if you can't
beat 'em, join 'em".  I have a 47 BL on my second account as well as
a 52 enchanter.  I will not be without slow :)

Buffs?  Not for me, keeping a DS up and people in rods is enough of
a distraction from nuking.  Tanking?  Well, I knew when I made my
mage that I'd be made of wet tissue paper.

Mages are about damage -- a combination of burst and sustained DPS
that no other class can match.  Wizards can outburst us, but it takes
much better gear than mine for a wizard to outdo me in sustained DPS.
Rogues in much better equipment than I have can out-do me in sustained
DPS, but are unlikely to hit my (current) max burst DPS of 350+
(260ish from rains, 90+ from a back-stabbing water pet)

My only problem is that I can't go from FM to OOM while maintaining
this DPS without being summoned and eaten.

This and the lack of survivability of pets in ae environments are the
only two things I'd like to see addressed.  It's not so much balance
vis-a-vis another class, but just a severe problem that can keep us
from living up to our magely potential.

BL pets aren't "better", they are comparable.  I feel this is as it should
be, necros, mages and beatlords live by their pets (although mages are
more likely than either to die without their pet :-P).

The test proposed by Empty is meaningless, if I put my 62 water pet
on the back of a mob and a 65 BL puts his 64 warder in the same spot,
My pet will win.  Switch out the water pet with 61 air and it will
be a close run thing.  Change the test to tanking and (barring intervention
from the player) 61 air is just *slightly* worse at tanking than 
the 64 warder.  Again, as it should be, the 64 warder is a spectral
spell, 61 air is an ethereal.
