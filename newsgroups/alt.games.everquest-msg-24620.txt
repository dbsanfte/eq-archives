AC is probably a waste.  Aside from the really early part of the game
(maybe up until 12 or so), you're simply not going to ever be able to
bring it up to anything useful.  You're better off with HP equipment.

Until you reach your mid 30's or so, concentrate hevily on +mana
items.  Intelligence doesnt' really matter all that much until you can
start hitting 5 mana or more per intel point.  Pick up moonstone
rings, Black Sapphire jewlerly, an embroidered black cape, polished
bone bracers, wolf fur slippers, and if you can pick one up, an Ishiva
robe.  If not, an Advisor/Oracle robe will do well.  The good thing
is, you can keep most of this stuff, as you'll be wearing it a lot of
it again once you finally get your intel maxed out to 200.

I'd also think very seriously about buying a pair of Tboots.  However,
being an enchanter, and in a group most of the time, you may not
really need them to escape danger.  If you dont' feel like you need
them, stock up on Sow potions.  

Should you take up jewlcraft (and chances are, you will), I'd build a
charisma suit.
