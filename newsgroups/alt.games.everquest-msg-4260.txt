Yes, the login server is down, but there is a way to get information. I'm
not sure how it works, but tools like EverMon have a scrolling banner with
the status text.  For example, during the recent emergency patch it had a
message like:

    Emergency server patch. ETA 0 hours, 44 minutes

So there is a way to get information to all of us trying to log in.  I don't
know why they don't have the client get that same message when it can't
connect to the login server. It seems like it would be a nice thing to see.
