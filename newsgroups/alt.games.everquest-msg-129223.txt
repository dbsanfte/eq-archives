Taellaar. *g* And thanks for the advice.  Now I think I've got *too* 
many choices *g*  I saw a Crystaline Spider Fang going for 400 today.  
So close, and yet so very, very far...

Also, roughly how much is this quest going to cost?  Any idea?  I was 
actually toying with trying some of it now, as some people on allakhazam 
claim they've started it around my level.
