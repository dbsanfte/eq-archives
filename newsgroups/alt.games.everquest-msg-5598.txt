Hello.... After following this group for the past little while (A couple of
months)
I feel I must make a prognosis on some of the Major problems in Norrath and
see what the rest of the group thinks, maybe it's just me.

However it appears that 2 major disorders seem to be rampant upon the face
of norath and i feel I must place the blame squarely upon Bertoxolus as
these seem to have reached epidemic (plague) proportions and we need to do
something to stop it before it destroys the whole world!

Disorder #1
Levelitis:  This serious disorder is characterized by a person who cares
nothing about the the enjoyment of the wonderful world that we live and
breath in everyday, and can only find pleasure in "Leveling up"
While I understand that there are certain pleasures associated with the
"Ding" sydrome, there is too much to be explored and too many things to do
(i.e. Tailoring, Blacksmithing, Cooking, Fletching, working on other skills)
and these poor people suffering from Levelitis seem totally oblivious to the
other pleasures and joys of the game, they only want to see 60 as fast as
possible so they can get "Phat Lewtz" which brings us to disorder #2

Disorder #2
Phat Lewtz Syndrome:  This is by far the WORST of the 2 disorders as it
seems to effect young and old and most within just a few weeks of playing.
Phat Lewtz Syndrome is characterized by the following behaviors.  Fighting
Monsters only for "plat and Lewtz", trying to roll over any drop that may be
worth over a plat.
"Ninja Looting" which is looting out of turn or before the monster even hits
the ground, but most especially looting items (including No-Drop) when
someone else in your group may have a greater need for it.  But the most
chronic sufferer of all are the poor people who will go so far as to ruin a
friendship over a single or multiple drops
Another form of Phat Lewtz syndrome are those poor souls who will sit and
camp a Monster for days or weeks for an Item they have no use for and intend
to sell, this in itself is not so bad provided there is no one else in the
zone who could have a use for those items.  I believe the second version of
Phat Lewtz syndrome is commonly called "Farming" but either way I have
noticed that Phat Lewtz syndrome has hit epidemic proportions, just go to
East Commons sometime and watch as people fight over those stupid Orc Belts
to show a classic example of both disorders.

So now that I have laid down the disorders we need to come about with a
solution.  So far the only one I can see is just simple understanding and
education.  It is my belief that we should take it upon ourselves to walk
the many lands of Norrath and educate those we come in contact with about
the dangers of these two horrible plagues.  And when the Plane or Decay
opens I shall personally go up to Bertox and give him a piece of my mind as
he seems to be intentionally trying to ruin the very world he seeks to
control.

Please feel free to comment on the above as i seek to know what the other
members of our elite little club feel on these 2 most important issues.
