Tell me.. did your 'model' have the same spawn/kill/wait system that
everyone else has? If it is you'll have the same ebay problems no
matter what you do. You can 'go after' people all you want.. they will
get around you. When there is money to be made they will do whatever
it takes and obfuscate their practice as much as needed so as to not
have you be able to pin this as actual 'farming'.
