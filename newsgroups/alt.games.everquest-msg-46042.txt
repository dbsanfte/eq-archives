In Freeport, head to North Ro and check Spoolie Gee's stock on hand. He is
in the inn, off to one side. You might want to save your money, though;
many of the Wu's items require 9 or 10 slots and the large sewing kit only
has 8. Find the community sewing kit in East Freeport (upstairs in the shop
with three armor and pattern merchants; I don't recall the name) or one of
the other community sewing kits in other cities (most places have one);
they have 10 slots.
