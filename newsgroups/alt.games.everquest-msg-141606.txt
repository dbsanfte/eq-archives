I am idly considering returning to EQ after a bit of a hiatus. The
only way I might come back though is to the supposed "Role-play"
server. But I have a few questions, and would love any response...

1)Do folks actually role-play?
2) Is the world empty of players, especially since you can't twink
there?
3) Any tips from players on FV?

Thanks
