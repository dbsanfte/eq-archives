My first char is a human wizard.  I did go as hard with int as I could, but
he always had a hard time of it.  He was always running OOM too fast, and I
started quad kiting much later than most people simply because my mana pool
was not up to snuff.  But I don't think I could bear levelling a wizard
again.  I do think about it sometimes, but I've started a gnome necro --
overdone, I know -- and I am constantly thinking how easily the necro can
kill stuff my wizard wouldn't have touched at the same level.  I guess I'll
probably just mess around with new combinations, rather than suffering the
wizard deal again.
