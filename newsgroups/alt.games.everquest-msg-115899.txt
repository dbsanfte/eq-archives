     On FV I logged into the Nek forest today just in time
to catch the buildup of forces of the Dark elves who where
preparing to invade Freeport under the newly created guild,
Children of Darkness.  I ran over to Freeport and was
invited to join the Defenders of Norrath.  Lenny, of course,
joined the CoD.  Within an hour, there were over 200 people
duking it out in WFP.  Lag was so bad I could barely move,
and could not cast any spells at all.  Not that it mattered,
I was so green that the only person I could touch was Lenny.
   Lenny, in RL, had decided to put away a fifth of whiskey,
and wasn't at his most rational.  He spent most of the event
yelling at me to "Die, Stupid elf BITCH!" (our computers are
less than 4 feet away from each other, and we pretty much
play side by side). It was somewhat distracting.  I
refrained from slapping him.  The /shout in-game comments
were pretty much the same.  For two hours, mass confusion
and random abuse was the rule, both in front of my screen
and to my side in RL.  Finally, he passed out, and I logged
out.  
   All it all, it was interesting, but seemed pretty
pointless to me.  Not sure I would be in a hurry to join
this sort of thing again.

Annie <--- Also kinda hopes Lenny wakes up with a massive
hangover.
