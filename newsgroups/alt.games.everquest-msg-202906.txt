the problem with them, which i dont think can be derived from the spell data
info thingy, is that the visage spells count as a buff

so you tash, you slow, you sit, you get up and cast a visage spell on the
tank, you sit -- and are aggro'd

it works just like that; you get aggro for casting it since it's a buff

you just need to wait, same as any other spell, for the moment when the
tank's aggro is better than yours

the visage spells are only good when there are two tanks in a group and the
cleric only wants to heal one..most damage classes know how to be
responsible about their aggro, so if they dont, then that's another time to
use it

still, be careful
