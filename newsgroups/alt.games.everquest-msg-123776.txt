Greetings,
    While waiting for the Nexus in North Karana to become activated I
decided to try and kill a griff or two with my 46 enchanter.  I was
surprised to come across this one named The Silver Griffon. Charmed a
regular griffon and sent it in. When killed there was text saying a
corrupted aura or something was given off in death. It dropped No Drop
wings. Wish I could remember the actual name.
     Later, I took my 55 druid to run around looking for any quest that may
be involved. I tracked it again but while trying to kill it I discovered
that it is invulnerable to changes in run speed. It is very fast. Couldn't
get far enough away to blast it without getting hit. Lost about half my hps
before killing it.
     Now both chars have the wings. There isn't much info at all at the
usual sites. Looks to be very new. I looked all over WK and NK for any clue
as to any quests involved. I haven't been to Qeynos as yet to ask around
there. Has anyone here any more info on this? Thanks


CommDon
