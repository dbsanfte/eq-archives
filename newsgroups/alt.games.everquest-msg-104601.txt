I even play EQ in third person, from behind. I find it works best in
EQ to also see yourself in relation to your surroundings as well as
critters beating on you from behind. Another advantage of this in EQ
is that you don't have problems with other players blocking your view
as much and your view is uniform whether playing an ogre or a gnome.
