Yesterday I posted about being randomly relcoated, sometimes in the air to
fall to death.  Many players ingame have confirmed that it happens, although
many more have never had it happen.

It hit again last night, this time on cable modem in clear weather.  

But to my immense good fortune, I wound up so high that I could get a /loc
before hitting the ground.  In fact, I had enough time to arrange my funeral
and get my last will and testament passed as an act of Congress.

I was standing at LOIO at about this location:

-2308.77 380.51 75.08

One split second later -- I am in clouds, nothing but clouds.  Doing a /loc
gives:

-2308.77 380.51 33786026184847998000000000000000000000.00

I did not make up that height number.  Is is 39 digits long.

I waited an hour for a GM to respond to my petition while falling.
Finally, gave up and gated from my location (in a galaxy far, far
away) back to the mill and resumed playing; keeping levitate on
the entire time in case the next random loc was not so high but high
enough to die.  It did not happen again all night.

Let's see someone deny that is a bug!  I have screenshots of it.

It needs to be found and fixed.  It does kill players randomly.
It does place your corpse in a location nowhere near where you
were standing, often (but not always).
