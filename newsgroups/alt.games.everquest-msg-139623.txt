I have personally always been a big fan of death resulting in xp loss
and corpse runs in EQ. Sure, it sucks when it happens to you, but it
sure does make you try a little harder to exercise some skill and
caution and halfway know what you are doing.

No xp penalty/corpse run pre-level 10? At the same time, I feel this
is a good idea. There should be a learning period for those who have
no clue what they are doing yet.
