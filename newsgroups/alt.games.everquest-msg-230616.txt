Maybe... If you had PoP and LDoN then you already had everquest right?

Call Sony, tell them you bought Evolutions to get the missing previous 
expansions (which is why you bought evolutions right??) but that you 
used the evolutions cd-key to create a new account instead of tacking 
the expansions onto the existing account.

They should be willing to ban the new account, and allow you to use 
evolutions with ldon, and pop on your old account. Be assertive, if this 
is indeed why you bought evolutions there is no reason you should have 
to buy additional software.
