If you had flung a heal on the tank, I'm almost certain
you'd have been ported out immediately.  It would have
added you to Naggy's hate list, and that's all it takes.

...and you may not be able to.

Last week my 59 Paladin was pulling Ice Giants to help a Vox raid,
and I couldn't even get within clicking distance of the "pile of
rocks" door, much less open it, before I got zapped out.  No way
I'd be able to open the door and run far enough down the slope to
see her.

I managed to get my Bard to levitate up the "back door" to her
lair.  My intent was to Sneak and tiptoe around the corner and
tweak her tail, but I sent an "Eye of Zomm" (right-click effect
from SS Helm) around to check, and she was looking right at
the place I'd be walking in from.  So that wouldn't be a good
idea.

Your best bet to actually see her is to buy a "Stalking Probe"
from a Tinker, and use its Eye of Zomm effect (5 charges) to
go take a peek at her from out of aggro range.
