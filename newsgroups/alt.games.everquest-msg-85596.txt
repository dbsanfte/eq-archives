A large percentage, but sadly not all. Next classic example. We're
camping the Hole entrance last week. Pulling down to the rock golem and
cruiser in front of the tower. A group has shown up and is sitting a
short ways behind us in the safe area. No biggie... people stage there
for small raids all the time, they see the entry is camped... no
problems.)

I've pulled another cruiser. We start fighting it, and I've no sooner
established aggro and we've begun beating on it seriously, when the monk
in their group (level 55, no less) stands up and decides he's going to
practice Instill Doubt on my mob. While most monk's ID is about as
useful as tits on a nun, of course it works this time. THe nearly full
health cruiser turns tale and makes a beeline  for his friends. We
managed to snare him and kill him before he made the base of the stairs,
but had he made it through the fully spawned gate and down to the golem
by the tower, the ensuing train would have been.... interesting to say
the least.

Idiocy has no level cap.
