Thats the way I remember it.

You could zone in, and kill things (although I never went, quit the game
before I got high enough)... but there was nothing special in there, and
nothing dropped anything but common loot such as fish scales.

I know we didn't download it, and I know it wasn't itemized for the longest
time... but I don't know if you were actually able to zone in from day one or
not.
