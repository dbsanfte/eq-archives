As i understand it, horses are part of the "global" models that are
loaded when you launch EQ (along with all the player races, pets, a
few select mobs and I believe some of the gods so they can be
"summoned" by the live team for GM events), and hence available in any
zone (unless you have the models turned off for the horses). I dont
believe your horse will suddenly look like a lizard once you zone into
a LOY zone.
