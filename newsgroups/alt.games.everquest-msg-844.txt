I wrote some scripts to look at how items were selling on eBay.  I have 
put characters, levels and servers on the site (voinsider.com) so far but 
I'm thinking about expanding it since I already have the data.  Since I'm 
not as into EQ as the 3 friends I made the site for, I don't really know 
what else is important to post on the site.  Check it out and let me know 
what items you'd be interested in that I have not posted on the site so 
far.  Maybe that can help figure out what sells.
