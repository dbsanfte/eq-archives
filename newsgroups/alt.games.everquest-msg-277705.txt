Actually, I was the original poster and I didn't mention which EQ
I was talking about (my bad).  But the person who griped about not
being able to put LORE in the shared bank was replying to someone
who had brought up EQ2 (as apparently EQ2 was already using the
terms that I spotted as new in EQLive).

Anyway, I have no idea how it works in EQ2, but in EQLive you CAN
put LORE items in the shared bank.  I do it all the time, especially
with my bazaar mule.  (If I have a Lore item for sale and acquire
another, I can put the one in the shared bank.  I can even then take
it out and store it in another character's bank in order to make room
to hold a third, etc.)

As for why there are Lore items at all, as others have said, there
are many reasons.  In some cases it's because having more than one
could be unbalancing.  E.g., the Rallic Pack (a weight-reducing bag),
you're only allowed one per character.  If you want other WR bags
you have to find other types.  In some cases it's to make it harder
to do the same quest repeatedly.  E.g., talk to NPC X and get an item,
take item to NPC Y to get the reward.  Making the item Lore means you
can't just say the trigger phrase to X over and over and then take 100
copies of the item to NPC Y.  Similarly, making a quest item Lore
makes it harder to set up a bazaar mule with a large supply of them,
so people are more likely to go do the quest themselves instead of
buying the pieces.  (The pieces could be made No Trade instead, but
that has other ramifications.)
