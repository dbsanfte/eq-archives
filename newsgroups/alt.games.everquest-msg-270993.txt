As far as I can tell, this is true.  I started a Fixer last night and
bought low level newcomer armor.  Leveling it seems to bring the stats
in line with the higher end versions I have on my nano-mage.  The only
hard part is remembering to level it. :-)

I still haven't figured this one out.  In fact, I didn't realize that
the Fling and Burst were specifically activatable.  How do you use the
special attack?

The biggest reason I've found for sticking around is the (in my
experience) higher rate of implant drops on the island.  If you get
lucky, an extra hour or two on the island can yield enough drops to
cover most of your implant slots.

My only complaint with the mission system is that the missions I'm
presented with that I want to go on for the award or cash-to-XP ratio
are generally out in the boonies, and I haven't found a way to "bind" in
this game.  When you're doing a harder than average mission and the run
is 15 to 20 minutes, dying can be a head-meet-keyboard moment. :-)
