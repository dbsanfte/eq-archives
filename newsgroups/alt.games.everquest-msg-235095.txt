They're forced to give it a National whatever rating (Thanks Tipper!) 
for what audience it's suitable for. However, even if the basic game, 
were you playing alone, may be suitable for young teens, the 60 year old 
pervert who tries to cyber with them the minute they log in may make 
that rating "change during online play".

If you watch the credits section when you're first logging in, it says 
the same thing, along with the rating it gives, including that warning.
