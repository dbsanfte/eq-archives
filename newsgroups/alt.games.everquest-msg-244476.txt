Galdorin Visigothe has this to say:

Norrath is so great and so dear
With all the folk that live here

Dwarves make lots of ale
High elves are too pale
Trolls are slimy and green
Ogres are very unclean
Gnomes can make things tick
Halflings, masters of the trick
Iksar get by with scales
Vah Shir oft' use their tails
Humans are very plain
Dark elves deal out pain
Frogloks are smarter now
Erudites, the highest brow
Half elves have no city
Wood elves are so pretty
The last Norrathians I'm told
Are barbarians who love the cold

All these folk share these lands
Putting it in very good hands
