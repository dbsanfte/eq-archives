Heck yeah...

I pay 80 a month for my business internet access too!!!

But lets see...

Go see a movie...

50.00 for movie...
50.00 for popcorn, drinks... candy... for the same amount of people...

Uh.,.. how about dinner...

Arigatos...200.00 for dinner, drinks... apps... etc... for the same amount
of people...

Thats 300.00 dollars.. for two lousy nights of entertainment....

I spend 100.00 a month for entertainment every night...   I am getting off
cheap...

I bowl in two leagues which cost me 23.00 a week plus twenty more for
bracket money... Thats 172.00 a month...

Ever go to a football game?

I go to the Bucs games...
For 7 people its 1000.00 dollars to go to a game, nevemind drinks and
food...

Ever go to a Devil Rays game... 175.00 for seven people, 200.00 for food.

Tampa Bay Lightning... During the playoffs it was 300.00 a seat... 2100.00
for seven people...

Soooooooooooooo...

We have had 2 guild parties at our home where people all over the country
came... it was wonderful.

We have made wonderful friends... Whom we visit regularly...

Your perspective is wrong, EQ is entertainment... the cheapest entertainment
there is... I would gladly pay double for the wonderful times I have had.
