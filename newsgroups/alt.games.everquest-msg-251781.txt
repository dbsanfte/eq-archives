"Mauvin hall"  =)  It's a spot I often hunt with my cleric 2-boxed, both as
magician and monk.  Though I take the higher level guards before the hall
and just uses the hall mobs as filler between spawns.  I can handle the hall
solo (much better with my magician than with my much better equipped monk,
sadly).

At 65, one will usually be light blue (which semi-defeats the point), and if
you pull the dark blue the light blue won't come.  If they both spawn dark
blue you just have to take two at once.

You should have the 61 DS, same as the 63 but single-target.  If you don't,
get it.  I honestly can't imagine that you don't have it already...

You've just stated the problem, and the answer to the problem, and seem to
have not noticed either.  =)

Let's look at what you've observed (and I'll throw in some further
observations from experience):

1. Magician pets switch targets (magician pets will switch to a much lower
health target and stay on it until it dies).

2. Your pet can take one mob without assistance.

3. You run out of mana alternating heals and nukes.

4. You have heals I never bothered to get with my magician (my observation
of course).

5. You "have to find a way to kill one of the mobs faster".

Conclusion: Stop trying to be a cleric.  Burn one down.   =)

My magician, when soloing, keeps one heal loaded and rarely uses it.  Pets
regen health very quickly between fights, have amazing taunt ability as long
as you understand the "rules", and basically allow you to nuke nonstop if
necessary.

You might also explore rains when taking two mobs at once.  That won't stop
the pet from switching targets, and in the long run the pet will take more
damage, but alternating a couple of rains (long recycle time) would probably
work too.  Or combining the strategies, you could bolt one, rain, bolt, and
that would lock the pet onto one target while still damaging both.

I used to hate rains.  There were many reasons to, much like I used to hate
bolts.  But at 61+, and with the changes to rains over the past year or so,
they really become a viable ability.
