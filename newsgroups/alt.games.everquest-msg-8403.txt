IMO you were a jerk.  If someon accused me of causing his linkdeath to steal
a spawn I would be pretty insulted and I don't think a follow up "just
kidding" would make everything better.  This is certainly not an "honorable"
way to behave.  I can't believe you actually considered reporting this guy
to his guild!  He gave you a lot more leeway than you deserved.  Overall, EQ
is a great experience ... but it would be a lot better if it didn't have
jerks like you spoiling people's days.

IMO this is VERY childish.  Two wrongs don't make a right .... and the fact
you seem to seriously think of this stuff reinforces my opinion that you are
a loser.
