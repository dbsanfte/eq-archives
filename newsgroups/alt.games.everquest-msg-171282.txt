Skills I use at level 54: Sneak (don't listen to people who tell you
it is useless, you need it to buy/sell/train in some places), Hide,
Forage, Sense Heading (not anymore but you do until at least level 39
when it caps), Taunt, Tracking, and sometimes disarm (mostly useless).
 There are no other skills, unless you want to take up begging or
something along those lines, that you will need.  I have never run out
of room for skill buttons.
