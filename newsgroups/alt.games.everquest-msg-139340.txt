There is no way in hell I will survive a port into Grimling. :-) Oh,
my characters will easily... but my computer won't. I have to run with
the camera pointed straight down to get through the zone at all....

I question the need for one in Dawnshroud. It's two zones away from
Nexus and the one zone in between is a complete pushover zone with
virtually no danger to anyone over L20. On the other hand, if it keeps
ME morons from training shrooms all over the people at the hopper
caves every five minutes it might be worth it.
