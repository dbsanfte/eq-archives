5 points for the first level, then 3 for the next level of Suspend
Minion.  Second level lets the pet keep its gear and buffs.

With the pet canni nerf, Suspend Minion has just become a way to carry
a pet while invisible instead of a way to store the good pet while you
canni.  Pet Hold is much better because I hated when I would call off
the pet but the mob would hit the pet before the pet could move far
enough away.  BTW, you can't suspend a pet during combat. 
  
Other good choices are Spell Casting Mastery (increases the chance
your specialization will save you mana), Water Elemental Form (+1 mana
regen when you can't sit on a mount and Enduring Breath), Mental
Clarity (permanent +1 mana regen), or Spell Casting Fury (critical
hits from nukes).
