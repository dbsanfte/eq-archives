Geek.com's glossary says this:

    IT (Information Technology) - The field of work dealing with computers
    and technology, or more specifically, the organization within a company
    that takes care of all of the computers, telephones, webservers, and
    Internet connectivity that keeps a company able to communicate with the
    outside world by electronic means. 

That is more in line with what I've seen, and better matches what you find
if you go look at the job offerings from companies that sell software.  The
development that falls under the IT umbrella tends to be *internal*
development.

Check out, for example, Microsoft, Apple, Symantec, and Blizzard, and you'll
find that the development jobs under the IT department/group/whatever are
for internal stuff, and the development jobs for things that are more
directly used by customers are under some kind of development department or
group.

I tried to check SOE's job offerings, but their jobs site is full of "page
not found" errors.
