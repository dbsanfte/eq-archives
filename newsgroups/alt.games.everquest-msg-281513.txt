For another first-hand opinion, I have played both EQ2 and WoW, coming
from EQ.  The only one I'm still subscribed to is WoW.

When EQ2 came out, about 3/4 of the main players in my very casual
guild (including me) tried it out.  The guild is pretty much gone from
EQ now.  However, maybe 1/4 of those that moved to EQ2 stayed there.
The rest of us went over to WoW around Christmastime, and almost all
are still there.  Some have even tried EQ2 again after the recent
changes, when there was that free re-sub trial week.  They came right
back.  A few of us tried Guild Wars...I think I lasted less than a
month.  I didn't even get halfway through the quest part of the game
before I got bored.

Anyway, I have thought a few times about trying EQ again.  I've always
wanted to play a bard, for example.  But trying EQ2 again has barely
crossed my mind.  Even the free re-sub week was barely enough to turn
my head and look at the recent patch notes.  I'll still try it if they
add beastlords, or some similar melee pet class.  That's about it,
though.

That's just my opinion, of course.  Everyone has a different
experience.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
