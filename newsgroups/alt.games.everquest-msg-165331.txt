I recently upgraded to a new mboard and celeron 1.8 ghz and
have a cable modem connection. Oh and added a geforce 4 4200 128 meg.
I already had 512 meg ram and an ata 100 hd.

Generally speaking, you will be the fastest in a different resolution,
like 1024 x768 or 800 x 600. You will be a LOT faster with all old
models. setting textures to low in options both saves lots of system
memory. 

I was using my geforce 2 mx 64 meg before this 4200 and had
no lag in the bazaar due to using old models. I got the 4200 and 
figured I'd use new again but am even laggy in the bazaar with that
card at only 5 percent clip, no names, low textures, etc. 
New models just seem to really slow you down at least in that area.

I set antialias to "let program control." I think in EQ it will
default to 2x then. Hitting don't use anti aliiasing will speed up
your performance but clothing textures on people will be jaggier at
the edges.

Unfortunately EQ is riding on top of an old engine, slowing down
under the weight of the new models no matter what graphics card/memory
you have. It doesn't take advantage of geforce 4 TI stuff.

EQ is direct 3d so the GL settings do nothing.
