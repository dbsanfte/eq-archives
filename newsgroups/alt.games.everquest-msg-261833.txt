According to the Druids Grove:
<cut and paste begin>

"Third Part - The Goblin Event

Bag of Diseased Maiden's Hair can be obtained by doing the Goblin 
Hide n' Seek event in Frontier Mountains. First, you need to make a 
Poor Goblin Disguise, and Master (100 skill) Goblin language.

The Goblin disguise:

Green Body Paint:
brewing Emerald Leaves (foraged in EJ) + Cactus Pulp (foraged in 
North Ro) + Lichenclover (foraged in FM, Field of Bone, FV or looted 
from FM mobs) + 1 Water Flask.

After the Body paint is done... Combine it with: 2x Copper Armband + 
Carved Wooden Mask + Goblin Lioncloths + Green Goblin Skin in a Loom 
or a Tailoring Kit. These items can drop of any goblin in FM or 
Droga.

The fastest way to learn to Goblin Language is to group with a 
friend and spam each other with goblin. It also helps if the other 
person is better at it than you.

After this is completed head over to the entrance of Droga in 
Frontier Mountains. Wait till it's nightfall, then click the Poor 
Goblin Disguise which will "disguise" you (it gives you no Goblin 
form). Inmediately, say "start the contest" in /say and in Goblin 
language. You will get a zonewide emote if you did it right and the 
contest will start. After a few minutes a bunch of Goblin Seekers, 
King Dronan and a few goblin named will pop. They will run a 
scripted event about a hide n' seek game. After the King indicates 
that the contest has begun, a bunch of Goblin Hiders will pop.
Now, there's a trick to finding them. I did it this way: simply 
track one, and when it changes direction in your track keep going 
the way you were tracking it before. Eventually you will find one, 
since they seem to pop in the same place (but in some random part of 
the zone). They hit for 200 more or less, they are rootable and 
snareable. Sometimes you will get Hider adds for some reason, since 
the event is bugged."

<cut and paste end>

At first read, I thought it sounded interesting, but now that I've 
read your post, it makes me cringe for anyone who might be there 
XPing or passing through to Nurga or Droga.
