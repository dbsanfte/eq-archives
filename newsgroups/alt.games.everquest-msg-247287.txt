Thanks Martin for your suggestion. I'm doing that now. I have FT12 and do
turn on FT3 when heading to known, heavy usage situations.  I'm trying to
increase the usefulness to my group with additional tribute abilities
without wasting them by turning on things that wont stack with my current
items and spell.

Thanks again for everyone's help.
