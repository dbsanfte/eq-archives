It can happen at lower levels, too, though it's less likely to
be fatal there.  The other night I was in a pickup LDON with a
level 23 monk who exclaimed with delight in /gsay when his Mend
skill worked.  Since Mend always works at skill 101+ I asked him
what his skill level was, and he said 15.  What's worse, I think
his Feign Death skill was similarly low.  I was running a monk of
my own (with most skills maxed or near maxed) and felt embarrassed
on behalf of my class.

On the other hand, that level of LDON is easy enough that the
group just mowed through it anyway.
