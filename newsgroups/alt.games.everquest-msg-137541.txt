You could try netherbian lair for a while.  The mosquitos in echo cavern are
great if you have a DS.  But stay away from the plant looking things.  They
will root you and suck your life and they are not killable.  They are not
even mobs, they're traps.  But just dont walk under them and you should be
ok.
