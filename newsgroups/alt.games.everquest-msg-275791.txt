Hmm. A few years ago I had a similar problem with a web forum, but
the requestor that popped up said 'bad password or login'. It turned
out to be a 'cookies disabled' problem instead. After several failed

they sent me, I then enabled cookies and got right in. So its not
always obviously cookies disabled.
