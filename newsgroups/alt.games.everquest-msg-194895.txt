Ogre warrior. There, ya satisfied? No? Shocker. No one can tell you what 
the best class is, because it's a personal decision. They're all great at 
something, so you are best off playing the one you enjoy the most. Some 
people just really like dwarves for surly role-playing opportunites. Others 
just want to be a wizard for sheer nukage.

Perhaps it would help if you specified what area you would like them to be 
best at.
