Don't know exactly what a Charachter is, but the best Character that you can
play is the one YOU will have the most fun with.  You usually know around
level 15-20 if it's the "best character"  BUT also know that characters
don't REALLY start to shine until the 30's.  Think LONG term when deciding.
ie, enchanters/bards/rogues suck (yes, I've played all three) in the
beginning, but EXCEL once they hit the mid/upper levels.

Right now, I'd say the best is a High Elf Cleric.  a Month ago it was a
Barbarian Shaman.

/shrug

you have to play what's right for YOU.
