VoQ is why enchanters get groups these days - it's enough of a boost over
KEI folks are willing to share XP to keep a constant supply.  :)

Speaking as an enchanter - VoQ means that I can do an LDON without
sacrificing a spell gem to a mana tap; KEI just doesn't keep up with our
favorite paladin's pull rate.  It means that a healer with decent mana
management never runs out of mana in BoT.

Speaking as a wizard, VoQ means I can usually drop an extra shock per mob,
so say an extra 1100 damage per mob.

I find VoQ a luxury - you can play without it (heck, you can play without
KEI) but it speeds things up nicely.  Maybe that's why my wizard and
enchanter are on separate accounts...
