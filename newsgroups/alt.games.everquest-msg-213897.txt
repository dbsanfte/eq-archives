East Commons, North Ro, I think S Ro, Butcherblock, Everfrost are the
ones I know of. I admit, I wasn't that thorough in my adventuring, so
I'm sure I missed a couple.

Only ones I ever actually went to were in North Ro, and Oasis. I think
there's one in LFay, Innothule, and Everfrost. There are others, I'm
sure.

All I've heard about the spells is all the LDoN spells are going to
only be purchasable via adventure points.

Can't really answer that, since my experience in the beta was limited
by time constraints. ><

It might have changed, but when I went in, I couldn't see any of the
items on the adventure vendors until I had points to buy with.

Didn't go through them all... The themes that I know of that have the
most undead would be Mistmoore Cats and Deepest Guk, I believe.
Rujarikan Hills theme didn't have any that I encountered.

>    Interactive objects: are they targettable the same as NPCs are?

Yup. Target them to inspect, detect traps, disarm, pick lock, then
open. You actually get xp on the open stage. Once opened, loot like
you would a mob's corpse. As I understand it, they basically are
"special" mobs... If you don't have a rogue handy or anyone who has
the disarm/unlock spells, simply target and attack, but risk setting
off the trap (which can be nasty, I hear. Never gambled with trapped
containers myself) or breaking some/all contents.
