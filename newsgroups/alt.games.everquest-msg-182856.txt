    God below, if we were doing taglines here I'd immortalise you as saying
"sometimes the fastest haste isn't the best"

    What're the other categories of haste?

    Yes. If a group isn't zero-downtime best-buffs and nuking like gods, I'm
even more better off soloing. I wouldn't dream of turning up to grind group
without C3 and I'm an SK.

    115 mana per 11 mins? I spent 115 mana per fight as often as not...

    That's ok you're doing a good job of ignoring me here.

    Considering the other enchanter has about a large chance of having C3 I
wouldn't mind that one bit. And about zero chance of casting anything other
than his top haste spell on us, I'd you wont be outlevelling us 2 to 1 any
time soon.

    Hey I'm all for declaring some buffs unnecessary but if you're disabling
your group's output by turning up without any mana regen, you're costing
everybody, yourself included, experience they and you would otherwise get.

    The MORE melees you have (and therefore typically the fewer casters) you
more important higher haste is!

    Hey you're probably a brilliant enchanter, but an idiot enchanter with
c3 is doing more for his groups than you are.
