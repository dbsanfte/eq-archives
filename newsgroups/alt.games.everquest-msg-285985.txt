Reinstalling over what you've got might not fix it, since it won't
touch the character-specific files.  (They're not part of the
release.)  If you rename the folder and install from scratch, that
ought to do it.  But it's a lot easier to just move the two files
for your character (named in my previous post) and see if that
fixes the problem.  If so, then start copying sections back from
the old files until you figure out which piece is causing problems.
Sometimes I've found something obviously broken in one of those
files, maybe a result of the client crashing at a bad time.

Good luck!
