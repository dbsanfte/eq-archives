	As a crafter, it wouldn't wave my flag to be making the augments.

	The difference is that in EQ equipment is dropped, there are some crafted 
items that can be useful, and every crafter has the full abilities of their 
character class at their disposal if they want the dropped stuff.  In SWG, 
equipment was supposed to be crafted -- only now, there is stuff that is 
effectively dropped, regardless of whether or not a crafter has to "process" 
it, and the crafters can't get it themselves because they don't have the 
firepower.

	SWG already has this in the form of weapon powerups.  They're a good source 
of income for Weaponsmiths because they are expended at a good pace, but no 
one is cheering over their ability to make them.

	EQ is still the 900 pound gorilla of the commercial mud market.

	How many thousands of people on a Quake Team server at once?

	That's not in dispute.  What is in dispute is which of them are any good.

	Well first off, that means 80% does not.

	Secondly, according to a poll on the SOE forums, the majority of SWG's 
players have never played a commercial mud before and bought in because they 
were Star Wars fans.  IE, they just don't know any better.

	Finally, it sure looks to me like SWG is starting to bleed people.  I'm 
willing to bet a lot of those accounts are "maintainence level" like 
mine...kept going just to keep the properties from decaying.
