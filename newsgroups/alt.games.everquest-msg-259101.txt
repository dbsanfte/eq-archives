Well, I would have recommended one of the 6800 Ultras (that's what I run), 
but I wasn't sure how much you were willing to spend. I'm not sure how Asus 
justifies their claim of 25% greater performance than other 6800's based on 
their circuit board design (I haven't read any of the reviews), so I would 
try and validate that claim before laying down their price. Their pack-in 
isn't anything to get excited about. But you're certainly looking at the 
right GPU.
