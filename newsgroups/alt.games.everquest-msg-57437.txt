Gang control of SOME kind would be nice.  (ie server checking to see just
how MANY MPC's are already within the zone before setting another in there,
since MPC's cannot zone, this shouldn't be too much coding)

True.  Cut their visibility down.  Its down everytime when it rains (if it
is accompanied by fog).  Should be simple, but, probably not, who knows.


> 3) they use more advanced movement tactics to evade the player

Cant agree with this one.  Sooo, the game would be more challenging? :)  I
believe that is the intent of VI.  Why incorporate endless lines of code to
make "smarter" mobs, when they can use US as guienea pigs. ;p

Dunno if I understand -exactly- what you are saying here.  So no comment. ;p

Why not?  ALL mobs are classified in class just like PC's.  The fact that
the coding inhibits most mobs from actually USING these abilities isn't
reason to down those MPC's that do.  Again.  VI resolved the issue with
"unsmart" mobs, sort to speak.

The mobs already exist though.  The MPC is just taking the reigns of that
mob.  Or atleast this is how I understand it.  In essence, MORE mobs aren't
being added to the zone just to suffice those who wish to play them.  If
this ISNT the case, well, then I believe maybe it should be. Though a
SERIOUS question to debate with you if I may in an intelligent professional
manner:

Would you still share these feelings (ie #6) if the above comments of mine
were applied?  I believe it just isn't "fun" at your perspective because of
such "errors" (which most like I said I agree with you) existing.

No.  This isn't a fix.  No offense, but, this is a contridiction to your
thinking.  So now the PC should be able to play around and/or fight the MPC
with almost no repercussions?  Mobs that are MUCH lower in level are agroing
on higher PC's everyday, and vice versa.

As I said, I believe the mobs are already in the "world,"  though the server
is just placing the "controls" at the hands of a person.

Yes.  Now you're thinking. ;)  Not only do I personally like this idea (and
agree above) but I believe it is one that could be presented (if it hasn't
been already) to VI.  Remember, I'm not doubting ONE BIT that ANY email that
is sent to VI with some sort of derogatory statements, they throw it away
immediately.  Well that and "negative" type comments such as "This just
plain suxx0rs).

I would prefer they FIXED the obvious issues.  I believe it not only gives
my own characters on PvP an added challenge, but allows me to challenge
others as well.

Naww.  I still strongly believe they added this feature mainly to create
"smart" mobs more than anything. Who knows though, really, what's going
threw their (VI's) minds.
