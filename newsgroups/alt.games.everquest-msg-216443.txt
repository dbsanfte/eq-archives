Necros are great vs. undead.  Before PoP came out I was once in a trio
that was 54 Necro and 2x 50 Paladins, we owned everything from Frenzy
to Lord in LGuk.  And we were there camping Frenzy for FBSS as neither
of us had a haste item, to give an idea of the gear level of the
Paladins.  Jabober was outdamaging us (individually) except when we
would get multiple IoN procs in a fight (of course, he always got to
beat on the mob's back, the coward).
