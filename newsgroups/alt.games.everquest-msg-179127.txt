I get KEI for soloing with my druid, that's really about all. Since
that's all about minimizing "sit" time after I kill something, that's
the only time I really care. If I happen to get it on another
character, great. But I almost never even try to get it. And if I
group with my druid, I don't get it. (but then again lately I'm never
grouping with my druid)

What really irks me is the people shouting "XXX with KEI lfg". If I'm
taking you into my group, it's because I want somebody of your class
and I want it played right. I'm not going to see "Druid with KEI lfg"
and think "Nah I don't want a druid... oh wait, they have KEI! Get em
get em get em!" And if you're a dumbfuck, KEI or not, I'll boot you
out and/or leave.

KEI is an accessory, not something to be relied on.
