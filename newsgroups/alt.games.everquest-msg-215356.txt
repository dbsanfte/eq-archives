   Yep.  And if I were to find myself in a guild that took up the
practice, I would /guild remove asap.  Better to have no tag than one
that will take any kill stealer, horse thief, or incompetent bumble in
off the street over my head.

I am guildless now... and making sure that I any guild I get into has a
strict screening process.
