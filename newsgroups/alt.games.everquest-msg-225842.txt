While the stats do get worse as you reduce in levels, the FT part, which 
is about 20 times as important as every stat on it, does not.  From 
level one this is a usable item, and its the cheapest FT you can buy buy 
a factor of 10 (even on a point per point basis)

If you play outdoors a lot, a horse is better mana regen, but its also 
even more expensive than an earring... and its useless indoors.  Since 
Indoors got a big boost for the low end game with the introduction of 
LDoN, an earring may now be a better buy than a mount.

I say this as a 52 mage who's owned a lizard since 40 or so, and Doesn't 
own a solstice earring yet.  Why?  Well LDoN came out while I was in my 
30s and I didn't really realize how much of my exp was going to come 
from there.  Oh well, as LDoN slows down the mount will start to pay off 
more and more, reportedly by 55 or so I'll be back to "planes all the 
time" for exp work.
