"Dwarfs"?  I thought only Walt Disney called them "Dwarfs".  We prefer
"Dwarves" thank ye, and don't think for a second that we look any more evil
than the other sour-pussed, scowl-faced so-called 'good' races out there;
though admittedly we do have a bit of a problem with bandits...
Back to Topic, RP being used as a guide for hunting can certainly be
challenging; and even differs among the good races.  Dwarves for example
should have no problems about the hunt for aviaks because their chicks are
always poopin on our cities front gate.
