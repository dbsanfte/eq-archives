  It's my opinion that it's kind of hard to screw up with a druid. ;)

  It would seem to me that troll shamans can later on make up for their lack
of wisdom via the Cannibalize spell and their ability to regen.  Trolls have
some other cons, like not being able to wear medium armors and the fact that
they're as big as a house.  Iksars have regen too, and aren't as big, but
the problems trolls face with faction are not quite as sever as Iksar
faction woes.

  I'm no shaman expert... but like sushi said, an intelligent player can
make any combo work well.
