    I was looking at the everguest 2 subscription cards, and 90 days for 
69.99 (canadian), it seem s bit pricy. So basically its 3 months for 69.99, 
seems like a big rip off. What i was wondering, is it 3 months? or does it 
count the number of days u acutally sign in all together? Because if i was 
to get everquest 2, i would probly only play 2 days a week, so i would be 
getting ripped off big time.

Any one know about this?
