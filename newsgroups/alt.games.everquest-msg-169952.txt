Well we had an Ebay guild on Brell called Radiant Decay. What they did is
ask everyone above 60 who bought a char on ebay to join their guild. It
didn't work, I think they attempted an Avatar or War raid and were wipe in a
blink of an eye. They are now disbanded. Lol

Bad thing is they joined other crap guilds. Ah well I'm staying all out of
the server politics and carry on as normal. Doesn't bother me at all, unless
they train me ofcourse.
