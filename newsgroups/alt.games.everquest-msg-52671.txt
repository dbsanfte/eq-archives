I agree, and also have it in a log file that he didn't start casting a spell
until Hadden was about 3/4 dead (com'on...a big backstab and
a quad attack, followed by me getting pummeled and attacking back
twice doesn't exactly happen instantaneously).  Which the GM
apparantly noticed, too.

Different GM's, I guess...of course, if the GM let the melee
folks wear it down to 51% and then didn't care when nuke-boy
dropped the big one on it, I'd have to say that's a pretty
shitty attitude from a GM.

Me, too.  The difference is that I attacked Hadden first, and he
was fully aggro'd on me.  I was lucky enough to know within 20
minutes or so his exact spawn time, and I'm sorry some dumb-ass
had to sit and wait on him for 4 hours (including me, the first time
I killed him to start timing his spawn).  If I am playing a caster
and am sitting in S.Ro waiting on the AC to spawn, but don't
have mana/don't see him/don't react quick enough, "but I've been
sitting here for 4 whole hours!" seems kinda silly to say if somebody
else gets to him first.  I've waited in S. Ro for a few days before with my
then 52 rogue, and saw the AC about two hills away.  I ran up just
in time to see him "adhere to the ground."  No damage done, but he'd
obviously been engaged already, at the time by a half-mana 47 shaman.
We were the only two people in the zone that could have taken him,
and you better believe that I could have out melee'd the AC from
a shaman needing root/dot to take him down.  But I didn't.  I went over
and sat with the shaman, medding furiously, and asked if she needed
help.  She waited until she had him right around 40%, and then told
me to go at it...and I killed him for her...she got the ring.

Now I could have taken it, and the AC is a very-KS'd mob in
S. Ro...sorta like HPH used to be a FFA zone on many servers.

But I saw he was rooted by someone not in a group with me, and
defacto, he was no longer my kill to claim, even though I could
have.

The part where he tells me that he gets 3K per earring in
EC?
