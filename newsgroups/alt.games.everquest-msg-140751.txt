Bleh, I didn't see you posting more to liven it up

And how could it have been anywhere near boring, when 3 r/l women were
typing pretty racey cyber for me?!?! :)

>(If anything was scary, it was the hordes of oversized sigs)

Theres one person who takes it as a personal insult when you mention
shrinking his sig..  it's come up on our private boards more than once

I can only think of 2 people with outrageously long sigs tho.. and only 1
was posting on that thread
