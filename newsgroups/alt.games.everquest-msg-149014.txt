 You're referring to a part of the game that only a small percentage
will be seeing. I haven't been to VT. I have 0 125hp items. Come to
think of it I don't have that many 100hp items either. Sure, if you
equip a monk with every single best item possible they may get up there,
but those cases are hardly unbalancing overall since they are few. I
just don't buy the 'Monks are overpowered' rants I've been reading on
the boards the past few weeks.
