Sadly, human's are not all capable of showing the same amount of self
control you believe them capable of.  Do you never have impulses?

Within the confines in EQ (or anywhere for that matter), it isn't always
100% possible to remember this consciously 100% of the time, and stating
that it requires 'minimal effort' is from your persepctive only and shows a
lack of understanding.

This isn't an excuse, just an explanation.
