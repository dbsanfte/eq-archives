Seems like I missed Mr Wizzard's response to me here.

We were, in fact, talking about the campaign against *all*
native Americans, not just some selected highlights.  Since
the interactions varied from actual battles, various
forms of co-operation to handing out blankets
deliberately infected with smallpox, we can't take
it for granted we're talking about "armed natives".

Plus, the topic was brought up by someone suggesting
that anyone wanting to call Israeli oppression must
first agree to give back America to the natives.

No, and no.  I believe you have snipped the rest of my
paragraph where I pointed out that "having bigger guns"
does not imply having the best genes.

100 years is too fast for evolution anyway, and I think you'll
find that advances in medicine which mean that poor genes
are not selected out will have greater long run influence on
which genes survive into the future than "killing native
Americans because they are inferior".

Plus, I have stated in this thread several times my objection
to Darwin being produced as a *moral* arbiter of some
kind ("the fittest survive, therefore that killing was good")

Bottom line, it just ain't true that being murdered by better
armed and more ruthless enemies is a proof that your
genes are defective.
