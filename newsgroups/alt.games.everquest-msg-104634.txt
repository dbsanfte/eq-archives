There's someone here who doesn't know what they're talking about, but
it's not the person you're replying to.

He's not talking about Bard songs stacking with other buffs, he's
talking *using* bard songs to bypass the anti-stack code on other
spells.

EG:

Buff1 doesn't stack with Buff2 - it's deliberately coded that way by VI

Buff1 can be tricked into stacking with Buff2, by singing Bardsong1 and
ordering buffs, so that Buff2 overwrites Bardsong1,  and you end up with
Buff1 and Buff2 stacking. Thus you could stack Focus and Kragg, or stack
Aego and Symbol etc. 

The recent fubaring of bardsongs is an attempt to fix that exploit, and
further goes to prove coding songs is a black art that VI forgot to put
1 point into at the trainer (:o/
