Note that "Hal" is violating several things in his ISP's terms of
service (posting to the wrong groups, posting to too many groups (he's
hit dozens of groups with this post, 4 at a time), posting copyrighted
material).  Take the time to send a complaint to his ISP, and we might
be rid of this junk.

Note: I'm not objecting to the content--people have the right to be
idiots and to express their idiocy.  Make sure in your complaints to not
try to get him banned for *what* he says...just for *where* he says it.
