At one point I heard someone mention that later on druids could stack like 
four DoTs. How does that work? I was told that you cannot stack DoTs, then 
I was told that you can stack them but only if they're of a different type 
(ie flame lick and stinging swarm but not stinging swarm and creeping 
crud.)

Could anyone explain this to me?
