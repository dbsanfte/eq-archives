My experience with this is limited, as I play a Monk. That said, when in 
groups with clerics I notice they usually have at least three heals memmed- 
their best Celestial (for topping off pullers, etc. I get cele'd a lot), 
CH, and their best non-CH for casters and emergencies. I also note that 
most keep up root and some keep up DA (good clerics!).
