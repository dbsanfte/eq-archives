No kidding. I was wandering through after exploring Permafrost (1) and
saw a bard of grouping range asling for group. Hmm, ok sounds fun. I
walk up, offer and we group. Before we can even discuss tactics, a
warrior shows up and asks to join. Hey hey! Tactic change, we need
to... Look, a mage, nuke and pet, get him! Rogue, nice addition, get
him too. Soandso says out of character "21 Shaman LFG to hunk aviaks" 
What was going to be a lark (pardon the pun) turned in to a nice churn
and burn group. Only 1 overpull all night, good chatter, fun group. As
we broke up, I noticed that a couple were in the same guild, and they
were discussing a guild offer to me. I am usually picky, but these
were great folks, and I accepted. A couple minutes guild chat decides
it, this is a great group of guildies.
Welcome to The powers that Be, Chrystiana Stormcrow of Ayonae Ro

(1) Heh, I tend to get a wandering streak. Should have been a kender.
Thos ice giants spooky. Nice hunt right at the zone for a mid 20's,
too tough for a lone 21, err make that 20, no I mean 19 Druid. (danged
death loops. Whoda thought that big nasty would wander over to my bind
point in Everfrost?) Back to 21 after that group, though. Thanks guys!
