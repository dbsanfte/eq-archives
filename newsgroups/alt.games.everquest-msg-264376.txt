If you just want to talk pure DPS, no parse is needed. If the puller 
always leaves when the last mob is down to 25% then percentage of the 
time the puller would be in camp adding DPS would be as follows...

2-mobs in camp: 87.5%
4-mobs in camp: 93.75%

Some people would trade that off as insurance against the possibility of 
a wipe. My point was that, mana permitting of course, if everyone is 
comfortable with their roles and the present environment, a couple 
additional mezzed mobs waiting in camp is better.
