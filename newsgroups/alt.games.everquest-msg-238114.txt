/nods.

Bots refers to 'robots' and usually has connotations of macroing, and
often of cheating. Its possible, in my opinion to use bots
legitimately without it negatively affecting the game (e.g. to perform
a hundred combines using the old tradeskill ui...) or to setup a buff
bot (In AC for example people had complex bots that would stand in
some out of the way place, and if anyone handed them an L-note or any
of a selection of pre-approved mob-drop objects it would buff them, or
open a travel portal for them... it was really slick. Basically a
player controlled npc... it didn't do anything that a player couldn't
do but it releived the tedium of actually playing that KEI/port
whore...

Unfortunately the potential to cheat with bots is considerable. So
they are often frowned upon, particularly since cheaters are drawn to
them like flies to ... 


Also many people who have more than one account do *not* use 'bots.

Many players are simply 2-boxers and are actually playing both
characters simultaneously without any macro-tools beyond what is built
into to EQ. This is usually ideally done with two machines, but you
can have a more limited solution with one machine (ie buff/heal
between fights, or one account sits in the bazaar)
