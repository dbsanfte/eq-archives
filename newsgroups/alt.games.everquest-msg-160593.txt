The simple act of attempting to attack generates hate. Go create a level
one character with no skills yet, equip him with his newbie weapon and
go attack a rat.  Even if you miss on the first swing, the rat will
react and aggro. Whether or not you do any damage, the hate is
generated.

Fully resisted spells generate the same hate (possibly even *more* from
the corpses I leave around) as spells that land for full damage.

Hate never "decays" that I know of. It only seems that way because as
you lie back in the grass and do nothing, while others are attacking,
you fall behind them on the hate list. "Fall behind" is even misleading
here, since in reality you are at the same spot. They just pull ahead of
you.

If you are the only person fighting the mob and you swing and miss just
one time, it will continue attempting to fight you until one of you is
dead or out of aggro range.

You know... I'm going to leave that there, but after starting at what I
just wrote and thinking, I may be totally wrong about "decay".  Only one
example comes to mind, and it was long ago, but it may prove the case.
We were setting up for an Ixiblat raid for the cleric epic, back in the
day.  The trigger mob had been pulled to the skyfire zone, but we
weren't ready to start yet. The mob kept wanting to wander away. 

So, to keep things at the ready stage, I attacked the mob with a single
kick. The mob began attacking me. For a while, I was in danger of
killing the quest mob without realizing it, because I kept riposting on
occasion. Then I turned around with my back to the mob and let her swing
away while we continued to set up.  Then, to my total surprise, she just
gave up and walked away, heading out toward the forrest. I had to go hit
her again to get her to come back to the staging area.

Hrmm... maybe hate *does* decay. But I can tell you, for only kicking
her once and riposting a few times, I was on that hate list for a
looooong time.
