First, log on at a time when you can leave your computer on,
and logged into EQ.

2nd - buy a Trader's Satchel.  They are available from Merchant
Tekrama just inside and to the right of the door in the building
between the 2 banks.  It runs 1PP and a bit of change, holds 
10 giant items, but weighs 25 so you can't just use them to carry
stuff around in.

3rd - put any items you want to sell into the Trader's Satchel,
you can only sell stuff that is in one.

4th - walk to one of the long covered stall areas where all the
other folks with "Trader" above their head are, find a clear spot
and make sure your into the area under the awning.

5th - Type /trader - A window will come up that shows all the 
items you have on your person that are in Trader's Satchels.

6th - Select each item - then, at the bottom of the window you'll
see windows for PP, GP, SP and CP - click on each one, and an 
entry window will pop up.  Enter how much of each denomination to
make up the price for your item.  When you have the price you want,
hit the Set Price button.  Do this for each item you want to sell,
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE PRICE YOU REALLY WANT IN THERE.  Can't
say this enough, folks have gotten some incredible deals in the
past because someone dropped a zero on the price and didn't catch
it.

7th - hit Begin Trader button - you'll get a list of the items you
have up for sale and the price on each - DOUBLE CHECK THE PRICES 
AGAIN.  You can alter the price at any time by selecting the item
and setting the price again.

Finally, Walk away, eat dinner, watch a movie with you girlfriend
have a good night's sleep.  Come back and see if anything sold :)
The window will have messages if people browsed your wares, and if
anyone bought anything.

If you can't leave it on for a long time, check the prices on tradeskill
supplies (like spider silks and pelts) and price yours a bit lower.
Folks with way more time will come along and buy yours, then reprice
them at the accepted max for your server.  So, if most folks are selling
spider silks for 5pp and you make yours 3pp 5gp, one of the other sellers
will often come along and buy you out and reprice.  ONLY DO THIS IF YOU
MUST SELL FAST - if you have time do not dramatically underprice your 
goods, price them near the median price, they will eventually sell.

If you don't know what price your stuff should sell for, bring up the
/bazaar window and search for that item by name and check the prices.
Take many of them with a grain of salt - make sure you see many prices
for an item from different sellers before you decide on a price (especially
important when you start getting items worth a few hundred or a few 
1000pp to make sure you actually sell it while not cheating yourself.

And ................ I tend to ramble, hope it helps some :)
