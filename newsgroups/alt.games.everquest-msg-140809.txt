Most people I know find they like a different class after they have already
leveled a char to 60 and watch another class play alongside with them. In
raids, in exp groups. the way the get around and the items/quests for that
class/race.

When I used to play my war being mt on raids I found myself liking the other
pure melee classes more and more. So I leveled a monk to 55 in my offtime
and found that the monk was not what I wanted to play. So I leveled another
monk to 50,but this time an iksar - got bored of him quick. Went back to my
warrior and was happy gain. Then one day my account gets hacked and all the
gm's can do is a naked restore. At the time I thought I will quit EQ for
good so I decided to decline the restore.... But damn things have a way of
coming back  3 months later (and alot of hardball merchant playing) I have a
twinked out rogue and I really like this class. I can't wait to do my solo
hate run and I am already working on the burning rapier quest.
