"I have Auto Split On" is an excuse to rob your groupmates.  And a bad one.  I
always, immediately upon joining a group, ask that "split" be turned off.  I
don't want the left over copper while those on their feet get the plat.  "Lets
take turns" works well.  If they don't like it I'm ok with it too.  I'll take
my little cleric with no strength and find a new group.
Getting older and wiser.... :)
