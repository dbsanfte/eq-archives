Thats not right....

Firstly, you need constant healing on your MA (versus Ail and the silencing
guardian).. clerics need to stay nearby (or be  able to run in range FAST.

Secondly, and most importantly, Ails ae range is HUGE.  I know this from
running my shammy and cleric there, and even on my druid "tunare checker"...
you simply don't have time to run out of the ae radius, whilst achieving any
kind of effective healing whatsoever.   You can't do a cheal chain versus
Ail whilst avoiding the ae.. you suck it up and figure a way to deal with
the silence.

I remember that, and dispell was mentioned as the "master plan" for dealing
with it (albeit not as openly as I think ppl are now..)

Every guild I've ever seen kill ail, from hardcore raiding guilds to
small/mid sized "once/twice a week raid" guilds has used bards to deal with
silence on clerics
