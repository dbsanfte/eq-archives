The bazaar is suposed to be more than a "prefered" spot to auction.
Supposedly they are making it so you can set up bots to advertise prices and
stuff. I'm hoping they do it like UO. I want to be able to give an NPC my
stuff, set a prefered price for it, and come back and collect my cash later
on. If they did this right it'd be worth the travel time.
