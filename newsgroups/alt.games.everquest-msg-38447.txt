>> 1    Is there any kind of map feature so you can work out there you are?

get maps from eq.atlas.com 
type:    /loc       this  will give your location in game.

>> 2    I have a level 3 druid, can I use bind, and if so, how?

you get bind at lvl 14.
you are already bound in kelethin so dont worry about it unless you start
travelling which there is no real need to until  lvl 15  by which time you will
already have it.

>> 3    I seem to be wandering around Kelethin at the moment without any 
purpose, I have talked to pretty much everyone and got a few very minor 
quests. How do you get more substantial quests and know where to go for  them?

With higher faction (gained from minor quests and killing certain prey) you
will get better quests. For more info on quests try
allakhazam.com.

I recommend bookmarking  both of these sites you  WILL be there often.
