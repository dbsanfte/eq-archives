How can you be offended man? You are a christian, most compassionate and
understanding of all religions? You know that people will sin, but you know
that you can forgive them.
The problem with this point of view is that is reduces someones personal
freedom. I can see a christians point on abortion and sex outside wedlock,
as these things do affect other people, without their consent. But then you
say that homosexual sex is wrong, based on your christian beliefs. To think
like that may be in keeping with what the Bible says about homosexuals, but
not what the overall philosophy of christianity says. You have to let go of
that mouldy old book, that really has no relevance, except for the main
underlying message. You gotta love your neighbour mate. That is what being a
christian is all about.

PS...Im not religious whatsoever, but I was brought through a christian
education.
