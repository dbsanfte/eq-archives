'Tis indeed so. If your intelligence is decreased, thereby reducing your mana pool,
you have less mana to regenerate overall before you're FOM. It's not about speed of
regeneration, it's about total mana.

For example, say your normal mana is, oh, 200 (don't ask me 200 what; I don't know),
and your drunk mana is 100 because of decreased intelligence. Assuming a constant mana
regen rate of 2 mana per second (another arbitrary number), it would take 100 seconds
to med to full when sober, but only 50 seconds when you're drunk.
