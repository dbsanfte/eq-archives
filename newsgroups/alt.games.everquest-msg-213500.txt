Hunt or Farm?

Hunt, I wouldn't suggest solo'ing most of the mobs there for exp. unless it
swims in the Sea itself pretty much everything there has some sort of proc
that'll make a solo, melee's life painful and often short. The island layout
of the zone doesn't lend itself too well to kiting, IMO.

Farming, you can probably start farming the Elementals at mid 40's
relatively safely...I am not sure when they stop social aggro, didn't at 51
but only takes you to kill one named to make you KoS to that type and they
will aggro on sight/in range.
Shadows, Mid fifties (ish) The 150pnt Lifetap they proc makes them nasty
opponents. My warrior can clear the island at 55 (buffed AQ, SLN, Regrowth)
but the Frenzied Shadow has a serious proc rate and is a nasty fight at that
level, think there is another named that is equally a PITA, don't remember
which. As a ranger you could avoid melee far more so, although the fights
would be longer you could probable cope with them at a lower level than my
tank.
Secret Grove - Laggy as hell this area, all the aliens here also proc their
special abilities (unlike the ones in Ten. Mnts.) and some are still blue
uptil 54. Beetles best choice for hunting.
