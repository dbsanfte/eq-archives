I am grouping up with at friend and looking for a new hunting ground.  30
Druid + 25 Necro, is the duo.  We have been killing the giants in WW - but
now am looking to move on to something more productive.  So far, all I can
come up with is SK - but either one of us has hunted in that zone.  Any
ideas where we could rake in the exp??

Thanks In Advance
JerryD
