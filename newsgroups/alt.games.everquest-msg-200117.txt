I'll do that... but I'm quite certain of it. Without Yaulp, I get a proc
every 20-30 seconds. With it it's every 5-10, with occasional strings of
multiples. My understanding is that haste does not affect proc rates, and
certainly mana regen does not, which only leaves the DEX effect of Yaulp V.

Basically, with Yaulp V there are MOBs that will drop twice as quickly
with Yaulp V than without, and a 30% haste does not explain that.

I've seen similar effects with other peoples' weapons with a bard
twisting their DEX song.
