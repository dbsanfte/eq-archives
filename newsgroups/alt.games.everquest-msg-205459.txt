Given room to run, I don't see why "oh no, slow aggro" is a problem.  So the
mob is chasing me instead of the tank, who cares?  Root it, snare it, or just
let me outrun it far enough ahead to get another shot at slow.  Or we give up
on slow completely and you just chase it around and kill it without worrying
about its damage output.  With a snarer and tanks that are capable of -not-
getting aggro (pets with taunt off are great at this) hate kiting is like a
100% slow, that costs no mana to land.  Only trouble is, PC tanks have a hard
time landing their blows on that moving target, it can be exhausting.  For a
group of pet handlers, though, its cake, just torque the mob, then keep moving
around while the pets chew it up from behind, extra bonus points for the
backstab pets some get.

I like exp per hour, myself, don't care whether thats 6 hard mobs or 60 easy
ones; its niether xp per mob nor kills per hour, but xp per mob times kills per
hour that is the item of interest.  In a way, a lower kill rate is -more-
interesting to me (given that its not coming from down time, but from harder
fights) because the fights themselves are more interesting.  Killing light
blues that my pet can solo without heals or slows... well I can actually do
some decent exp per hour that way, but it starts to pitch me face down into my
corn flakes after a while
