I've recently started playing EQ again (or trying to), but am rather tired
of Pauldale Caverns.  I've been here from LV18 (less than a bubble into 18)
to 1 bubble left into 22 (actually at one point was as high as half way
through 23).  This is getting too repetitive now.  I'd like to find a new
place to hunt.  Can anyone recommend a good place?  I'm a LV22 DE Necro.  I
also need some better armor and items first.  I'm currently in an Apprentice
robe (which is OK for now), +2 INT ring, +3 INT GM event ring, and the rest
of my armor was looted from orc pawns in EC.  I've got about 500pp right
now, but am not sure what would be good to invest in and for how much (+INT,
but also AC? STR? HP? Mana? other?).
