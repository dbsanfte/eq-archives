    Note that: casting CH once every so often.

    If all someone needs when partnering for XP is the occasional CH, then
why try and increase the healing power of a druid on instant heals? Could
you not function as well with a variant of Celestial Elixir (1500 healed for
300 mana)? Wouldn't a CE variant be better given the massive aggro a CH can
draw, and how completely helpless Mr. Assling In Leather would be after that
aggro? Ask that Velk's cleric some time how overfull on mana he is and what
heals he casts.

    If you want a raid role, wouldn't a group CE be an awesome spell - low
aggro versus a straight group heal, so efficient it'd be silly, great
healing for casters modding or against AoE damage (especially if it was
coded to be usable with /tgb)? Imagine that - a healing role that doesn't
involve casting one's biggest heal on the biggest tank in the raid, the role
a cleric already has! But the druids that want CH aren't the brightest
apples - they see one heal that is "most efficient", and so they want it.

    And amazingly enough, all three are used for different things and have a
place on a raid. Things like casting time and HoT vs. instant heal really do
matter, you know.

    If druids don't know what to ask for which would be reasonable and
ensure them spots in raids/XP groups, and instead ask for the moon and the
stars, well, g'bye!
