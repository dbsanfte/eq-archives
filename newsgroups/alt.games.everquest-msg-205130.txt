Not something I recommend.  Limits your flexibility.

Let's say I've got my bard in Trakanon's Teeth, chant-kiting the ghosts
there.  I've got my drum equipped, clicked the SS boots for levitate, hit a
round of Selo's Acc Chorus for speed, and I'm chewing on a champion with
Chant of Flame, Chant of Frost, and Chant of Disease (my usual mix.)  But
the gods of pathing have decided that a frog shaman is going to join the
dance, and I'm being dotted and nuked - it's only a matter of moments until
I'm rooted, and then that champion is going to make elf-paste in a green
foil wrapper.

If I was using macros for my twists, my best shot is to run until the macro
ends and hope I'm not rooted.  Unsatisfying, it wastes time and XP I could
be earning.  Without switching targets, I drop chant of flame for snaresong
to give me more time - and I can do so instantly, whether that means my
twist changes from 1-2-3 to 1-4-3 or whatever.  Then I switch targets to the
shaman, twist 6 in there (charmsong), tab back to the champion, /pet attack
and away we go.  My kill rate doesn't even twitch.
