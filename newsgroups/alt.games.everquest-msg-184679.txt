as far as I can tell, there's not much difference between indoor and 
outdoor in EQOA.  Some things that are different in EQOA --  SoW will 
drop as soon as you cast an offensive spell or start whacking something, 
similar to Scale of Wolf in EQ.
The faction conning sucks major, you get Blue face(amiable), white face 
(indifferent), and red face (KOS).  You do get numerical values whenever 
you change a faction ie: 231 Circle of Unseen Hands (-1) first number is 
your current value and second is the change.  I kind of like that you 
get the numbers but the displayed value never goes beyond -2000 or +2000 
even tho it's possible to be above and below those values.  I also 
haven't figured out what value a faction changes from indifferent to KOS.
There is no zoning in EQOA either, you run around for miles and you have 
  no idea what zones you are in unless you check on the start button. 
At least the compass works without having to use a sense heading skill.
One complaint from a few rangers I've talked to: Using a bow uses your 
power.  Power is like mana only everyone uses power, spells use power, 
skills like kick use power, everyone has a pool of power.
Another thing that's different is no corpse runs, you never need to go 
after a corpse, but never go out hunting with all your money on you. 
Half your money is taken whenever you die, keep it in the bank and it's 
safe.
I do like the coachmen, makes it easy to get around, you can start off 
in qeynos and in a few hops be in freeport.  But..you have to run that 
trip first, no free rides.  LONG RUNS to the next coachman but at least 
for the good races there's plenty of them, not sure of evils but I've 
heard a few complaints about there not being enough coaches.
Vox is alive and well in her little corner of the map and as far as I 
know no one is high enough to go after her, yet.  I've seen quite a few 
30s the last few days so I anticipate someone will have to go see her soon.
Alot of things in EQOA are different, some things are recognizable tho, 
I've found the NK spires and the bridge to EK alot farther apart than 
you'd think they are.  Oasis looks nice except for some nasty stuff that 
didn't like me. Freeport needs to grow up some to look like Freeport and 
there's no sewers there, come to think of it, I don't think there's a 
Qeynos aqueducts either.

Don't play EQOA expecting it to be the same as EQ, it's vastly 
different. In fact, I don't recommend any hard-core EQ players to come 
play EQOA, they won't like it.  EQOA is great for people who really 
enjoy doing quests.  You get special skills or spells for completing 
them and alot of experience.  If you talk to your guild master from 
level 1, you get to level 3 without touching a mob. Then if you get 
lucky on drops, you only have to kill 2 mobs and go back and you're 
level 4.  I love the questing, I plan to do as many of them as I can.
