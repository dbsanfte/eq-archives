Not at all.  Using the Fungi Tunic as an example, I COULD afford one
if I wanted, but I dont feel it is any more appropriate for my level
than the Cobalt Gauntlets or Idol of the Thorned I have in the bank.

Yes, the PLAYER earned them, the character did not.

For some of us there is a distinction between the 2.  Just like to
some people this game is a game no different than playing Mrs. PacMan
while others of us treat it as a different world where each character
has different sets of rules.  Would a young Paladin for instance
accept a gift from an evil 50+ Necromancer?  I think not, yet players
often use a necro to farm items for thier other toons.  Some of us
dont agree with the min/max mentality.

Sadly you are right.  Most people, like most in the Real World, lack
any sort of spine.  I am an avid anti-twinkingPL and it never ceases
to amaze me how many people who were right there with me in that
mindset eventually turn to twinkers themselves, most commonly for 1 of
2 reasons.  They either hate selling so much that they go with the
"Well, I have a Velium Etched Stone Mace, Crystal Chitin Shield,
Gauntlets of the Black,  etc.... I guess I will just start a Cleric."
or after getting to fight with Dragons and Giants and all sorts of
interesting creatures, they consider the killing of Orc Pawns and
Black Bears to be too tedious so they make it so they can get thru
those levels safer and find a friend to PL them.  

15 months on my main (only for the most part as I RARELY play any
alts, none are even double digit) and I still have no desire to twink
despite having over 30k in the bank at one point.  At level 35 I would
buy MUCH better than I have on or I could simply wear the Cobalt and
Idol, but I am a believer in not having equipment that is overpowering
for your level.  To make yourself ultra powerful for your level takes
out a large part of the challenge.  The trip to 60 is a journey, not a
race.
