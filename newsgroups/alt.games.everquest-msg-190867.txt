Case #1:

PL'ing a cleric by letting my pet take a mob down, reclaiming
the pet and having the cleric finish the mob with a nuke.  Cleric
is sitting out of aggro range while pet beats down mob, I reclaim
a second early and the mob attacks me instead of running.  Cleric
stands, nukes once and gets xp.  Until the nuke that killed the
mob hit, he wasn't even on the hate list.  This happened many,
many times while I was PL'ing the cleric.  In a couple of spots
where mobs don't run, this was the standard.  The cleric always
got xp.  This is because the removal of the pet makes all the damage
done to it up to that point uncredited, and the cleric does the
most damage to it.

Case #2

Over a period of 2 months we made raid after raid in CoM to get
our huge number of Druids/Rangers their JR.  I and a 55 pally in
our guild were usually early.  Since we were LFG so the raid
leader could see who he had, we were ungrouped, but bored.  He
would pull stuff, and I'd sic my 54 water pet on their back.  I
sat nearby while the mob stayed on him and my pet outdamaged him
with the result that I always, *ALWAYS* got credit.  There is
no questiong that he had aggro and I outdamaged him.  He NEVER
got credit.

This doesn't even mention the fact that I presented a link and
the quote from the patch message that said the group with the
highest aggregate damage gets the kill.

But, because you "strongly disagree", we'll just throw out this
massive body of evidence and accept your word.
