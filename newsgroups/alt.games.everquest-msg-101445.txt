Speaking as someone who has played on Brell, Tribunal, Nameless, and
Tholuxe when they first came out, the DAY they first came out, let me
assure you that your time frame is very conservative.

There is usually at least two guilds aiming to be the top guild on the
server by the second week, and the only reason it takes that long is
because 1. the gms don't usually make guilds the first week and 2. it
takes that long for people to find out who is who.

These, contrary to popular opinion, don't generally fall apart until
MUCH later, if ever.
