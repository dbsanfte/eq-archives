I hate it when writers of scripts put in things in movies when they have no
idea on the use of the reference. (the movie Dungeons and Dragons is the
biggest example)

I.E. "You reached the 50th level of Kunark!"
and other EQ things that the Drummer of the Band says that I can not
remember atm.
At least he did wear a EQ T-shirt a couple of times.

LOL.
