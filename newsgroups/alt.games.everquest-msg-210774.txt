My mage has never had anyone ask for a focus item in 24 levels.  In fact,
one summon has been requested; arrows.  At 16.  Then again at 20 by the
same guy, who I was happy to keep supplied, in fact going so far as to
always have another stack on my cursor.

I didn't even remember the things existed till I hit 16, actually, although
some have existed since level 4; they weren't listed on my "all the spells"
worksheet I'd printed out ages ago, and castersrealm was down so I wasn't
looking there for spells like I normally do.  Looking at Lucy for the first
time when I was checking out locations of level 16 spells (by the way, Lucy
doesn't have locations!) I noticed I'd missed several summon items and
kicked myself, as an utterly untwinked mage these spells are the equivalent
of a couple hundred pp worth of bazaar bought gear.

Most people either already have real focus items for these effects, or
don't know what focus effects are and why they are more important for a
caster than just about any stat you can think of (yes, including
wis/int/mana, no, perhaps not including HP if the amount of HP is large
enough)

I'll tell you one thing that would help encourage me to hand out the focus
gear; make it non lore.  I can't pre summon a bunch up while LFG, I have to
hand over mine and summon replacements.  Its time consuming, its a mana
hog, its tiresome.

Another thing that would help; put the description of effects on the item,
instead of only on the spell.  As it stands, its "hey, want this no rent
item with crappy stats and an obscurely named effect?" if I just send a
generic tell with the item linked, so I have to explain the darn thing.
Its a pain.

Putting the effect description on the items and allowing you to summon them
in quantity would also mean you could summon up a trader bag full of each
sort and leave them on your bazaar mule, hopefully getting them into
circulation and teaching people what they are...and giving mages a
potential income producer similar to (but far less effective than) the
KEI/Temperance deals, while based on summons which is the raison d'etre of
the class, after all.

Splendid One, 24 gnomage, Firiona Vie

ps in my greater experience as a cleric to 65, shaman to 51, bard to 57, so
on and so forth, I rarely saw anyone requesting focus items from mages in
groups at any level
