Hmmm, your reply seems like a complete over reaction to my post; but I'll
take it inline...

I can't point out an instance where you said competition was bad.  As far as
you saying improving EQ is a bad thing, am I limited to your initial post or
can I look in all of your posts?  Also, do I have to match that phrase
exactly or can I post an "implication"?

"Fanbois"?  Well, I haven't played in more than 3 months; but I still have
an active account at least until November.  Frankly, I'm a little taken
aback by your surprise at finding EQ fans in a newsgroup called
alt.games.everquest

I disagree.  There is a formula for successful MMORPGs, which includes
strong financial backing.  Verant has that, they are not panicking.  They
may very well be engaging in "press release warfare", but that is hardly new
amongst competing products.

Girlfriend?  What's a girlfriend?

I look forward to it.
