** Project M Implemented  **

Tonight we have patched something to the PvP servers that many players have
been waiting for. The ability to play that gnoll, orc, or the cute and fuzzy
rat. On your character select screen you will notice another button in the
upper right part of your screen called "Monster". Clicking this button will
randomly place you in a low-level NPC in a random zone. You will be given
full control of the creature to do with it what you like. You may hunt and
kill other creatures. You may even attack other players.

I didn't see the button they're talking about.  I don't have any characters
created though.  Do I need to make one for the button to appear?  Its on the
8 character select screen right?  I've tried verious PvP servers just for
test, even went as far as the first part of character creation (the choose
name, race, class part) and didn't see it anywhere on the screen.  Sorry for
the late question but just got a chance to log on and try.
