Seriously, congrats.  It is an amazing feeling.

I had been saving pp for close to 3 months as I need to upgrade my weapon,
and had enough to get my wurmslayer.  I head over to EC (pre bazaar days)
and see who is selling what.

I see that one guy is selling all of his equipment as he is starting a new
character and wanted some quick pp.  I send him a tell letting him know I
am interested in his Wurmslayer, and he quotes a price that is more than
half the price of what I was expecting.

We start talking and he informs me he is also selling a FBSS, but
unfortunately is a little out of my price range.  I give him the money,
get my Wurmslayer and go about on my merry way.  A few minutes later I get
a tell from the guy telling me to come back as there was a problem with
the trade.  I go back over and he puts the FBSS in the window and tells me
to give him the remainder of my money and the sword I had on hand before
my wurmy.  I do so and he gives me the FBSS.  I was so happy, hell I still
get happy when I look at my inventory.

To this day whenever I upgrade my armor/weapons, I just head over to a
newbieish zone and announce that I am selling so and so and end up
practically giving it away for money in hand and the piece they are
upgrading.  Its a good feeling doing that as I know how the person on the
other end feels too :)
