Bladeturn is good. It's using tactics, which is good. But its only one
thing to reduce the massive domination archers have had. They're
getting nerfed to hell now (and they thought Mythic was different
*snort*).

As for the visibility problem, considering you STILL can't tell which
direction you were hit from that only matters if he appears in front
of you.
