I think it all depends on what they are begging for...
I get relatively high lvl folks begging me all the time to summon
bandages for them, or of course the infamous food,drink, weapon and
I'm sure as I get higher, to summon them armors, and what not.  Most
of the time this happens while they are on a corpse run.

One thing about a magician begging, is they probably won't beg for
"stuff" (even at lvl 12 we have enough summon spells to give walmart a
run for it's money), they will most likely be begging for cash.  At
lvl 16 you start getting really expensive spells,but you probably
don't have the cash to buy them.  When my first mage hit lvl 12, he
sat at the entrance to BB and summoned bandages and what not for cash,
then ran to the Ice Giants in front of perma-frost and would exchange
stacks of food and drink, for plats or fs weapons, when he had enough
cash he just sat there and played banker for a few hours each week,
exchanging gold for plat, and keeping the silver and coppers.  By the
time he hit 16 he had enough cash to buy spells well into his late
20's.

My new mage (lvl 7), is not going to need cash for anything BUT spells
and reagents.
