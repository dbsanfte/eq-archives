Im an officer in a guild that does strictly merit loot too.

We base loot on a few things

Raid attendence whilst online - ie how many times you raid whilst your
online
    (then raid attendence overall) - how much you actually play
Last loot date - We have an online database that records loot dates
Total loots in a period - How many loots you have gotten last month e.g

+ Random factor - we just "decide" every now and then to give loot out of
guild.  For example, we went to kill AoW, a guild was on Vindi and in our
pull path, they wouldnt have a Vindi force for another hour+ and we didnt
want to take their mob, so they joined us, we killed Vindi, gave them the
loot.

We pulled Statue immediatly after, whilst they were still with us (we really
didnt need their help on vindi, statue or AoW, we just wanted to kill aow
asap) started taking tells, and then decided sod it, lets give them
everything on Statue too.  We could of used some of the loot, the rest we
would have banked for dot money etc, but every now and then we decide making
somebody in a small guilds day >> the guild bank

The random factor is rare times that people raid with us, like a one-off
occasion.  If its somebody raiding with us most days in a view to joining,
then they get standard loot rights (but if its uber loot and its v a guilded
member, guildie will win).

We have given AoW loots (BoC, Helms, Bows) to non guilded people, as an
example of how high it scales, but they have been raiding with us a month or
so and are recruits (who may or may not get it)

The hardest thing for us usually, is where to place "alts" in the running
for loots.. e.g I take a 62 shaman to every raid as my alt (occasionaly
cleric/wiz) but my shaman doesnt ask for loots until its FFA (if its FFA
anybody can loot, but if they say in officer channel its FFA then I'll speak
up for my shaman before everybody tries to loot it)

Some people do ask for loots for their alts though, and figure that "my
cleric alt is at every raid, he should get the same loot consideration"..
its a hard one to call, but 9 times in 10 I will vote against a "bot"
getting loot, unless the other names on the list have no merit or do not
deserve it.
