That's what I heard too.  But our team was sharing with his team for over an
hour already.  Since before Mezzmer got there they only had 3 people, we
even helped them on adds and everything was fine.  We even agreed that the
named Orc would be FFA (of course we got the halberd).

It only got bad when Mezz got there.

Actually we did outpower them.  Our team consisted of a cleric, mage,
wizard, chanter, warrior and pally.  We were taking most of the kills.

>Some battles aren't worth fighting.

You're right, it wasn't worth it.  No one was enjoying the camp anymore.
For one jerk to ruin an entirely enjoyable event for 6 other people just
pisses the hell out of me.  Geez, I guess, if you're right, then bizbee is
right too, huh?

PS  quick poll:  How many other people will honestly move away instead of
holding their ground?
