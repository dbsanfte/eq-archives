Nice one!  I was thinking along those lines, but you hit the nail
there  :D  I often have an amusing image in mind when people get
"hoard" and "horde" mixed up, too.  I'd rather sneak in and loot a
dragon hoard than a dragon horde, heh.  I've seen many a media
article, website, etc., get those muddled.  Oh, and "grisly" often
gets mixed up in newspapers with "grizzly".  I read an article here
where they said the dead victim (found in his car) "had suffered a
grizzly death", which is equally sloppy.  Made me picture a huge bear
rearing up from the back seat and shredding the driver... 

My main hate, though, is "rouge" instead of "rogue" - I mean, how hard
is it to get THAT right, ffs?
