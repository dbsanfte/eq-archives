Okay, you win. Nobody ever got put in jail on a 'say so' arrest.
Nobody ever got jailed with no laws broken, ever.

That I posted there is absolute nonsense. Because people have gone
to jail with no laws broken. If any of you think nobody ever went to
jail for any length of time with no laws broken, then you have not
experiened reality much. Maybe you didn't live in 'olden' times,
thats pre-1990. But such things were going on fairly recently.

If you don't want to believe such things never happened. Thats okay
with me.
