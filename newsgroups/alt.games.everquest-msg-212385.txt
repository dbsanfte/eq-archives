> What is that .... death / damage per second?

Damage Per Second. The harder MoBs you face at the high-end game, the more
HP they have, and the faster they will be able to kill you and your group.
Therefore, high DPS from you and your posse will bring down the MoB faster,
and is therefore desirable. Simple logic. :)
I have yet to try the Trials in PoJ myself, but I understand that high DPS
is essential to complete them, since you're working on time limits before
next wave of enemies pop.
