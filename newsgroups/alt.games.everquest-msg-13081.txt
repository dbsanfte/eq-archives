Hmmm, now thats not bad - not bad at all! Ah, so many accents, so few
characters - Im going to have to start up a whole bunch I see... the
Slavic Gnome Enchanter, the Hick Erudite Necro, the German Barb
Shaman, the Scottish High Elf Paladin... oh yes, fine times!

Hmm, maybe an Australian Human Monk? 
Monk:"G'day mate - whoa, fair go cobber - you almost got me there!
Struth, bruce! Easy on!" 

OtherClass: "Hey, you Monk -  go pull that mob!"

Monk: "No worries, mate!"

Yeah, I think I could work that :)
