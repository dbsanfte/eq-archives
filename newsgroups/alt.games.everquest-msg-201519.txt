Totally agree.  I'll read them again soon, I'm sure.

LOVED Jhereg, but thought they all went slightly downhill after that, but 
not at the steep angle that most series' take when the sequels come out.

I did NOT like Brokedown Palace.  I don't remember why.  Imagine that.

Jhereg was great.  If you like fantasy, you should like this book.
