EQ1 was never exactly a hard game to play. I played an enchanter, which was 
perhaps one of the most challenging clases, but that doesnt even compare to 
the skill you need to compete in a FPS or starcraft.

Id rate eq1 as 95% grind and 5% skill, so "succeeding just by putting time 
in" is pretty much what eq1 has always been, and probably ever will be. WOW 
is in the same category too.

If anythig , his message seems to suggest that success will be made more 
available to those who *cant* put in heaps of time. ie the casual player. In 
any case, I think talk about developing eq1 is a bit moot.
