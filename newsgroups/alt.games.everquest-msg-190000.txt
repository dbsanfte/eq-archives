Ohhhh, ok, thanks for the information. :)  I'd heard that the sense of
taste can change for herbivorous humans, but not that they themselves
smell different.  I can't fault her for that.

As an interesting diversion, the opposite sort of thing happened to my
husband.  We went on the Atkins diet to lose weight (about the same time
we quit EQ), and he's been thriving on it.  I went off (I'm the sort who
could be a vegetarian but NOT a pure carnivore), but I don't know if he'll
ever be able to eat bread/pasta again.  As soon as he does, he gets an
upset stomach and bad acne.  Greens are no problem fortunately.  

The human metabolism is much more individualized than I used to realize.
