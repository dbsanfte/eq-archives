At the end of the Coldain Shawl 3 quest, you earn the Seal of Thoridain
which you turn in with your old Shawl to get the new shawl.

But you also get back the seal!

Is it possible to give this Seal to someone else for them to use?

In other words, instead of going thru the entire quest, can they just borrow
someone's seal and turn it in with their shawl?
