Well, it's an odd set of rules you play by while PL'ing with a monk.

The biggest one is that the mob must be at the end of its run path.  That
can take several forms.  In some zones, the mobs never run, therefore the
mob is always at the end of its run path.  If a mob runs off to the point
where it starts to pace back and forth, that's the end of its run path.  If
the mob is rooted, it's at the end of its run path.

My method of PL'ing a caster with a monk is to beat a mob down, feign, then
root with the caster.  Root assures that the mob is at the end of its run
path and the PL'ee will get the experience.

As an aside, if the mob breaks root before the nuke hits, which will happen
occasionally, and the mob isn't yet at the pacing point, the PL'ee won't get
experience.  To illustrate why exp isn't based on aggro, imagine this
situation with a wizard PL'ee whose root breaks and the mob comes to beat on
them, channels a nuke through the beating for a killshot, obviously has the
aggro, and yet gets no experience.  Been there, done that.
