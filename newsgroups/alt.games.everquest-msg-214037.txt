Wow you leave them game for a couple years and everything changes, went
through the tunnel yesterday and not a sole there (can't say that I miss the
spamming though), went into Blackburrow tonight and there were only 3 people
and not one train the whole night (can't say that I miss trains in BB either
but they were funny sometimes)
