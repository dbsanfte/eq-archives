Why?  Get 20 iron rations.  Better, 20 Fish Rolls.  Or better
still some stat enhancing miraculous meal suited to your
class, and then a stack of something cheap to force feed.

See rations above.  Fuzzlecutter 5000 is the one stack solution,
or look at Qeynos Afternoon Tea or Kaladim Constitutional.
Alternately, drink Milk, its same thirst quenching as water for
half the price.... only reason for water is trade skilling.
