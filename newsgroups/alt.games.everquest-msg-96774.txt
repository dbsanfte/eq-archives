Ok, I've gotten this from this NG and checked in the code some mana
calculators use (castersrealm one at least I think).
Previously any int above 200 only counted for 1 mana per 1 int. Now it has
been upped to simply half of what you get normally up to 200 int

Mana supply:
up to 200 int: (level * int (max 200)) / 5
above 200 int: (level * (int - 200)) / 10

in your case:
(51 * 200) / 5 = 2040
(51 * 21) / 10 = 107
2147 + 155 extra mana = 2302 mana

with your mana gear:
(51 * 200) / 5 = 2040
2040 + 325 extra mana = 2365 mana

So in your case your mana gear is slightly better then your int gear. The
difference gets smaller as you level up, but it's almost negliable. Do note
that higher int/wis helps with tradeskill increases so you might want to
hang on to that +int gear for a while longer.
