Fishing IS worth it. If your group is down on  it's luck then popping a few
fish out of the water can be a boost.

A bit boring so always a timely thing after you've had a good bashing and need
to heal!

Bait is 2/4cp and the fish sell for 1/2sp so not a bad ROI :-)

Also it's part of developing the overall character so go for it!
