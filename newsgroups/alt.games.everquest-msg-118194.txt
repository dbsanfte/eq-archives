Ok, so just as I suspected, weapon does nothing (most likely).  Now, how do
I put a sign on his back that says "Don't give me a fucking weapon"?  If I
have a 2-handed sword or a halberd, I might toss it his way, but 9 times out
of 10, if my pet has a weapon then some jackass gave it to him on the way
by.
Have these people ever thought about *asking*?  I know their heart is in the
right place, but if I have to destroy my pet and recast a new one to be
effective it can take FOREVER to get my highest level pet again.

Thanks to all for clarifying this,
SEAN...
