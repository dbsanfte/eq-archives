I know that Phara Dar does an AE mez...and that is pretty bad (but you can
get around it). Charm would be just brutal tho...too brutal, really. A
single charmed person can wipe out a whole group when fighting EEs or
whatever...imagine if a third of your raid suddenly turns on the
rest...with a big dragon still alive hitting as well.

Zland...forgot about him. Not a good target for most folks, on most servers
(as far as I know) he is heavily farmed for ST key pieces. So is klandicar.

Ah, but the tranix crown is obscenely rare, and usually awarded to a monk
when it drops, who are not likely to let it go.

I phrased that poorly. By one resist I meant say...fire and disease, or
poison and cold...magic is seperate. The only dragons where you can skimp
out on the magic resist is in the west wastes. All the others need heavy
MR.
