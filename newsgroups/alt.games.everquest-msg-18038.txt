This is what Warriors should do when asked for a port/sow:

/em Wiggles fingers hopefully at %t

then right click on the preserved split paw you carry around for such
occasions...


Wouldn't be quite so funny with a cleric somehow, but oh well...


My enchanter gets mistaken for a druid when he's in illusion:wood elf
since he's wearing things like whitescale tunic, hand woven leggings etc
(since robes don't show up in all illusion forms).

When I get asked for SoW I usually say, "I'll give it a try, hang
on...", then breeze them instead :)

Confuses the hell out of some people...
