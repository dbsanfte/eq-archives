As I recall, the way it works is this:  when you cast 
alliance/collaboration/benevolence on an NPC it raises the faction that 
they're on.  Clurg is on multiple factions.  So what I did (when I only 
had alliance) was cast it on one Greenblood SK, one Graknek warrior, one 
bouncer, and Clurg himself.  It doesn't stack completely with itself, but 
it somehow partially stacks.

'Course, now I'm ally to everyone in Oggok except the merchants, the 
banker, and the shammy guild in my native Gnome form, so I don't need to 
mess with all that. :)  Bash dem lizzies!

Only the banker is KOS.  Keep forgetting about that and having to 
mez/memblur. :)
