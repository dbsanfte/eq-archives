That is true as far as it goes.

However the point of contention here is that there are those who
believe that such a character is appropriate here in the US..

Also, one needs to consider that, once a child begins questioning,
where do you stop??

Lesa et al's position is contradictory.

On the ONE hand they state that you should ALWAYS answer a childs
question and should NEVER tell them, "wait till you are older."

On the OTHER hand, they state you should only answer a child's
questions up to what you believe his or her level of understanding.
This directly contradicts her/their first position..

On the THIRD hand  (three hands, like that??  :^)  ) Lesa has now
introduced the concept that, if the child is able to pose the
question, that means they would automatically be able to understand
the answer.

Needless to say, keeping up with her/their position is difficult at
best.

I agree with this 1000%....  Which is why it is obvious to anyone but
the most PC-Blinded liberal that there is MORE than "teaching
tolerance" in this HIV Character.  If tolerance was truly the issue,
then a racially different muppet would be a LOT more appropriate.

In the United States, a child is more likely to run into racial
intolerance more so then HIV intolerance..

Just my opinion, of course...
