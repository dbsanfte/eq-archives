ALMOST cleric level...

But, please look at what you just wrote.  Everything you have told me that
we have is defined as being second best to someone else, unique only in that
it is combined in one class.  This argument could be use for ANY class, AND
they all have SOME spell or ability that they are best at on top of that.

The right combination in a party will render us completely superfulous.

I have very good friends, and am a founding member of the Arbiters (E'Ci).
They are great people and would never dream of excluding me from anything I
wanted to join in on.

That doesn't stop me from worrying about how much I have to offer though.  I
want to be there because I'm useful, not because they made room for me.
