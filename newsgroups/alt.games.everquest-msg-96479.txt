1) Go through Kithicor, West commons, East commons and into Nro...  Get on
the raft at the docks where they have Finkel or some funky name like that.
Board his raft when it gets there.  It will take you to Velious.  Given you
are 17...  Most of the mobs out there on the main island of Iceclad Ocean
are in their 30s, I would say....  No.
