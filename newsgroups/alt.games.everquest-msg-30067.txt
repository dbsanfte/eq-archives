I have a couple of questions about faction:

1.  Is the *amount* of the change in faction vary according to the death of
particular creatures?  For example, the faction change resulting from the
death of an Orc Pawn vs the change as a result of the death of an Orc
Legionnaire.  Or perhaps and Orc in E Commonlands vs an Orc in some other
zone.

2.  How many degrees of separation comprise a particular faction/consider
unit?  For example, how many degrees of 'apprehensive' might there be?
There is probably no way to know exactly where one sits in that spectrum.
One might be able to calculate how many particular critter deaths are
required to raise the faction to the next level.

3.  Are particular factions more or less resistant to change?

My thanks in advance for the sharing of your wisdom.
