In 1-handed form the ornate gets a damage bonus that scales linearly with
the higher delay warblade.  I probably would too.  Of course, all of us can
only dream of 35/23 1h weapons until a couple expansions from now anyway.

(45 x 2 + (65-25)/3)/30 = 3.43
(35 x 2 + (65-25)/3)/23 = 3.7

My main hand 1h weapon - (17 x 2 + (65-25)/3)/21 = 2.24

Yeah, those would make some kickass 1h weapons.  But since they aren't, it
might be better to look at them as the 2h weapons they are.  :)

Using your formula for modals --

(45 x 2 + (65-25/3) + (65-27/4) + 1) / 30 = 3.79
(35 x 2 + (65-25/3) + 1) / 23 = 3.67
(52 x 2 + (65-25/3) + (65-27/4) + 1) / 42 = 3.04

When they're 2h weapons, using the "modal method", it's obvious which one is
the better weapon.  No surprise, the one with the better ratio and higher
damage bonus.  I'm not a big fan of modals, however, as I have found
situations where they are simply wrong in what they would suggest.  That's
because they don't take into account haste and +atk, both of which will have
an impact on a weapon's performance.  For instance, the REBB and mithril
shod staff.  The REBB puts out better damage in my hands, but put the
mithril shod in the hands of someone with 2k+ atk and it will outperform the
REBB.
