Enthusiasts,

I am a newbie, and was perplexed by something that happened
earlier today.  I was playing my 12 wood elf ranger in Butcherblock
and I attacked a bandit at a camp.  Glynn and Glenda Smeltpot and
Barma Dunfire all came after me.  I ran to a short distance from
the crossroads, so I could trot to the guards there if the bandits
were getting the best of me.  I killed the three without much
trouble, probably only because a kind sole had just before given
me a terrific buff, which increased my HP by more than half.

Immediately after I killed the second, a fourth bandit named
Gundl joined in.  I killed the third and started in on Gundl, who
conned blue to me just as the other three had.  I could not land
a blow.  I was using an axe of the iron back, and I missed 28 times,
never connecting.  My son had sound advice: "Daddy, run to the
guards!"  As the guards seemed uninterested in my peril, I died.  I
did land one or two kicks, as well as a couple punches, but that
was small satisfaction.

My question is, why in the world was this guy impervious to my
blows from the axe?  I haven't a clue.  Thanks in advance for your
help.
