Not to the same extent....the wizzies response to the mob moving in his
direction is likely to be to run screaming and mashing his 'save me'
hotkey. An SK is however likely going to have built up a fair amount of
aggro from his melee, his bash or slam, plus his smaller spells and so his
big hit spell is going to drag the aggro right at him. He is also liely
going to continue delivering the damage etc.

At that point a warrior has a problem retaining tank status.

My main is a ranger and if there's one thing I CAN do its pull the mobs
off the cleric and the nukers. Dual wield, double attack, kick, taunt, and
disarm plus snare, flame lick and root and nukes add up to seriously high,
seriously fast aggro.

It has been noticeable as I have gone up my scant 38 levels and seen the
game changes over 2 years so of play that warriors have an ever harder
time of it retaining their main tank status. If I group then I wait till
the pull has occured and the MT is kicking butt - then I get involved,
snare if necessary (but not always) but otherwise my spells get used for
buffs, emergency crowd control, maintaining SoW and the odd bit of rapid
heal on the nukers in downtime to save the cleric's big heals.

I recently went hunting giants in GD in a trio...myself, a warrior and a
Pally. THe warrior pulled and engaged. BOth myself and pally had problems
with aggro hitting us...him with his 100point heals, and me with snare.
Yet we both had to be stunning and nuking otherwise the warrior went
down..and when the giant turned on us it was too much...we had to split up
the group dynamic was so bad....

THat warrior with all his melee ability and hate list raising skills could
not keep aggro even with us doing the bare minimum to be assists.

Yes, but as that giant hunt above showed now its really difficult for
enough to get generated before you are needed to assist. Its easier in a
full group with a dedicated cleric, a specialist nuker etc to spread the
hate.....but then as a ranger, or and SK or a pally you still arent using
your abilities to their fullest except in specialist events ie ranger
acting as nuke group bodyguard.....now with the upgraded raid system you
can put a ranger in a nuke or heal group to act as emergency aggro
generator to save the wizzies so the kill group can come in more easily
(mainly open raids rather than say a guidl raid)

I did wonder for a while whether I should actually bother upgrading my
weaps as weak though they were they did keep the aggro down....Soloing
became impossible so I did the upgrade. >
