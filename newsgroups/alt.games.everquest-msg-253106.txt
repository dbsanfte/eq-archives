Need Before Greed.

The idea that items should be distributed among the people contributing 
to the fight on the basis of it being an upgrade for them, rather than 
among all people that contributed on the basis that they can sell the 
item if its not something they actually want.

Slightly better is "can and will use", but in both cases this policy is 
often better defined as "opportunity for dishonest people to cheat the 
honorable"; its quite easy to lie about what will be an upgrade for your 
character.  In a good guild this isn't that much of a problem, in random 
pickup groups its highly likely you'll see at least one abuser in any 
given group.

Even in a guild, though, its subject to other forms of abuse, for 
example a poorly geared character (as, to be honest, most of mine are, 
since I tend to more or less ignore gear while driving up towards 65, 
figuring to worry about that later) is going to see more upgrades 
dropping than one who took the time out from leveling to gather good 
equipment; you're favoring the people who were lazy coming up!
