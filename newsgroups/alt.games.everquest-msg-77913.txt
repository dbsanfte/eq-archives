Hi, I was wondering if any of you learned tech types could help me out a
bit, please.  I just unpacked a brand new system and I'm wondering how to
get the most out of my hardware...

Athlon xp 1.7 Gig
Asus Ti 200, 64 MB GeForce3
256 MB DDR (getting another 256 today, for Luclin - seller forgot to install
it)

I just installed Kunark and Velious and went with the default settings the
game suggested. Well, it sure is blinding fast compared to what my P-233 MMX
and 8 MB Voodoo could churn out but the resolution isn't what I thought it
would be...

Anything I can do to make things look a little better?

Regards,

Thumper

PS: What does the Mip Map thingie do?
