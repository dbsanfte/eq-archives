As others have pointed out, getting him his own account is best.  If
you can't/won't do that, you can't fully protect yourself, but here
are some things that will help.

1. You said your characters are on the Luclin server?  Make a
character on some other server, e.g., Brell.

2. When you aren't playing, make a backup copy of all the files in the
EQ directory that have the names of your Luclin characters in them,
and delete those files.  Then log in to your Brell character, to make
sure that the default server on the server sleection screen will be
Brell.

Now, when he plays, it won't be obvious what server you play on, so
unless he actively tries to find your characters, he won't see them.

3. When you want to play, restore all those files you backed up in
step #2 before you start EQ.
