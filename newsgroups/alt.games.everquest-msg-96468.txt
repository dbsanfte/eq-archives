I didn't think there were THAT many. Maybe there was just a
coincidence of dumb posts in a short period of time.

You shouldn't need a raid guild. Anyone with a group of friends can go
to a dungeon and it doesnt take THAT long to get to any of them.

I don't make judgements on roleplaying. If you find DL and OT a great
place to roleplay well more power to you (you get a /boggle from me
though, with ill omen they make up the unholy trinity of
idiots-in-shout zones). Only in the quality of the zones and in
fighting in them am I talking about.
