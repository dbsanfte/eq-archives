What wizzies need is a focus item of there own that works by
doubling cast time, while reducing mana cost by about 50%.  That
would give them the option of doing improved sustained DPS against
fast burn down at lower efficiency.  I really don't think it would
be an appropriate thing for mage's, because we already have our
pets doing sustained damage in xp groups.
