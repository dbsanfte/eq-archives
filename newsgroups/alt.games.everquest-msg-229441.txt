Ran an LDoN last night with my regular group plus my shaman friend I 
moved to this server with (first time getting them together, after all 
this time, went well which was nice)

The core of this group is a husband and wife warrior cleric team who 
have their computers adjacent to each other IRL, the warrior runs 
forward, the cleric follows and assists to get his targets, moves 
forward just far enough to be in lull range (its not LOS).  They do a 
very good job this way, and accidental aggros from getting too close are 
always on the warrior instead of the cleric, while the warrior can 
usually grab most of the aggro'ed mobs when the cleric gets a resist and 
attack reaction (rare due to a high charisma).

At any rate, we have little trouble finishing the mission proper, making 
decent time (its a collect), 61 minutes to complete, even though the 
cleric doesn't have KEI.

Afterwards, I kill my pet to run Eye of Tallon (twice the duration of 
Eye of Zomm, but annoyingly it invis's me when cast, so my pet dies), 
and go play scout.  Two names up, in seperate directions, one really 
really far away, the other merely really far away.  We go for the second 
mob.  But its a long way, as I say, eventually we are forced to lull 
mobs and pass them.  Despite a narrow corridor, this actually works 
fine.  Up in our fight spot, we attack a mob in order to clear room to 
fight the named.  Goes reasonably well, until suddenly I get attacked 
from behind.  Another mob adds.  Two more add.  The other mob at our 
fight location adds.  At the height of the encounter we have 6 mobs on 
us, juggling roots, pet parking, slowing, Pally, Shaman, even cleric off 
tanking... only person not directly stopping mobs from doing anything is 
me, and I'm dumping my mana bar fast as I can to turn 6 into 5, 4, 3, 2 
OOM; including letting my pet die and casting a replacement while 
happily its crappy earth pet root keeps its opponent standing still just 
long enough.  We live, using every bit of our full mana bars, a mod rod 
charge each, a LOH, and every trick we can think of.

As soon as the last mob dies, warrior pulls the named, which we procede 
to tear apart regulation style, despite having pulled on less than 10% 
mana... mob dies, we loot, and poof, kicked.  Had to try it no matter 
how unprepared, the timer was running out; and it worked.

Anyway, as I say, this is a very reliable team here, we did nothing 
wrong at all, except that the Lull rules have changed, and this is our 
first encounter with exactly what that means.  Mobs came in on us as 
their lulls wore off and they chained in in short order, just as you 
would predict; from first cast on to last cast on (the mob next to the 
one we were actually killing).

Solution A) would be to find a better spot to pull to, further from the 
adds.  B) would be to recast lulls as needed on the couple mobs closest 
to the fight.  C) would be... what?  Kill our way in instead of lulling 
comes to mind, but this would have been impossible, if we hadn't had to 
go nuts and kill those mobs behind us we would have been a little ahead 
of schedule... but we wouldn't have killed them as quickly as we did 
when pressed, since we wouldn't have run as many chances (several HP 
bars got to within a hair of purple, and my earth elemental pet root 
thing is -highly- unreliable, wouldn't have tried it if it weren't for 
the fact that a new pet is a lot more HP for the mana than healing a pet)
