At level 51, with the Luclin expansion, you have the ability to get
'Alternate Advancment' Exp. It's kinda like leveling except instead of 'ding
you get next level' you get a 'ding you have 1 more AA point'. you use those
AA points for everything from faster running, faster hp mana regen, stats
(int wis str etc) etc

http://eq.castersrealm.com/archetype/
http://eq.castersrealm.com/archetype/Details.asp?Id=15 Run speed for example

each 'ability' in the first of three rounds of AA (one at 51, one at 55, and
one round of AA abilities at 59) has a set number of points to get, and a
set level you can attain. Run speed cost one point per increase and you can
increase 3 times for example. Someone who has run3 will run 30% faster.
Someon who has 3 HP regen will regen 3 hp per tick standing 6 hp per tick
sitting more than someone who doesn't.

Hope this answers some questions. in game to look at what skills you can use
(if you have Luclin) hit the V button and your adVancement screen will pop
up

Good Luck
