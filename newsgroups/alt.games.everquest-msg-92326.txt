Judging from the number of calls we take every day, one would think
DTV was the worst system in the world... But looking at the comments
and call history on the accounts of the people calling, one thing
turns up... Most of the callers call quite frequently. Every little
twitch. No matter how many times we tell them resetting the system by
unplugging it is going to fix most problems (which is usually all that
has to be done when they're on the phone), the first thing they do is
call. Or they're calling because they ran past their limit on PPV
porn...

Heck, 90% of the calls we get, the person could solve the problem
themselves if they'd even skim the owner's manual...
