Depends if you raid or not,my cleric doesnt.
My 65,10 AAs Cleric has 220 Wis and FT9.This is with some (free)
Ldon Wis augs.
We had this discussion not long ago,but I am happy to repeat.  :)
My update sequence:

1)Focus effect
2)FT
3)Hitpoints(Sta)
4)Str,Dex
5)Wis or mana(I never look for this,comes automatically)

I just love casters,who fall when a mob looks at them;lately  I was 
grouped in PoD at castle area(lvl 57 mobs),casted my *best*(rofl)
heal(no IH2 item equipped) with my 55 Ranger on a 57 Enchanter,
guess what,his hp bar moved for 10% !!!
I still wonder,how that is possible,but I casted several heals on him
with the same result.Thank god we had a tank ,capable to hold aggro
*very* well - me.   :)

Melforge 55 Ranger(tank)
