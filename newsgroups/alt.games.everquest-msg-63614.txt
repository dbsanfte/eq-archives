  I never bothered researching the druid epic extensively, but the
impression I get from most of my research on the epics is that they usually
involve bringing down at least one boss-type mob that requires the concerted
effort of several high level characters (or even several high level groups).
So it helps to be level 46+ or preferably level 50+ so you can attend and
pull your weight during the raids.

  However, most of the epic quests have elements of them that can be
completed at lower levels, starting as low as level 20 or so.  You won't be
able to actually complete it for a long time to come, but you might want to
do some research on your epic quest to see what parts you can get out of the
way now.
