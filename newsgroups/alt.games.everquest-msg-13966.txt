Hello! First, a little thing that bugs me for some reason. The company name
is Verant, not Verdant. I cant imagine where people find that 'd'. Ah well.
But anyways, you should've jumped in the water, and then died. Nearly
everything in the game will happily go in the water to chase you. But even
not knowing this, you should never have to worry about 'accidentally'
exploiting. If you do something, and you realize that it's letting you get
away with something, no big deal, the GMs arent going to come grab you. But,
if you continue doing this, knowing full well you shouldnt be, well, thats
trouble. :)

I hope that made sense. :)
