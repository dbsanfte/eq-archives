Looks like it's a slow day in a.g.e., so I'll throw this one out. 
Mudflation. It is one of the biggest problems in any MMORPG. Once the uber 
items become so affordable that you can easily buy gear that you couldn't 
dream of questing at your level, what keeps you going? Time spent with 
friends? Adventuring to new places? What do *you* do to keep if fun and 
interesting?
