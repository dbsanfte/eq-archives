Was interesting to see your evaluation.  I note that your examples were
heavily skewed to PoP (and not Tier 1 either), where I have not played.

It could be that my appreciation for other spell effects is in part
due to my keen awareness of Root's deficiencies, my only higher level
(not high, only 55, but higher) character is a Paladin.  I always have
Root mem'd, even when it's probably a waste of a slot, just because
all it takes is one time that Root prevents a train, or lets the
Enchanter get clear to cast, or allows the survivors of a wipe-in-
progress to camp/gate/zone to make up for a month of not using it.
But when I Root it's usually in the midst of, or a desperate attempt
to prevent, a disaster that would not be happenning except that some
key spell effect was unavailable or the player with it was an idiot.
So I tend to view other things as more valuable.  Perhaps I'll start
playing Kaev again and level to 60 so I can see for myself in PoP, but
I'm not leaning that way at present.
