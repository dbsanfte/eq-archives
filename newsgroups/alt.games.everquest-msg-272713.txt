A rooted MOB will attack the nearest PC in melee reach over any and all
pets that might be or have been beating on it. This is one reason why
Magician earth pets, which cast root, are not very welcome in most
groups because of the proximity aggro due to the root (e.g. the player
rogue can't move in to backstab because the MOB will turn towards him
even if a pet has inflicted substantial damage and otherwise generated
lots of hate).
