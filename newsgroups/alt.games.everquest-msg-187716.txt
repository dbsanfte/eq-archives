Once again we have a difference of opinion.  Having a cleric
myself, I'd never consider not rezzing a group mate.  If I was
really pissed, I'd rez them and disband them.  It's simply
part of the territory of being a group cleric.  Before creating
Dhargo (our shared cleric), the main reason we ever invited
one was for rezzes, with their ability to heal just relieving
our druid of the task so she could nuke/dot more.

But then, I feel that helping with CR is the responsibilty of
everyone in the group who was there when a group mate died.
If you can't count on someone when it drops in the pot - then
they are worthless.  People Like the OP who abandon groups
while they are still in harms way and who don't rez someone
they committed to supporting are that sort of player.

Like I said earlier though, the speed looting asswipe that
prompted the whole thing wouldn't have lasted 2 kills in my
group.  Guy joins I say "Ok, we roll for the nice stuff,
Tsuga or Beach ML's the cash drops.  Just before we lose
someone we split."  Guy loots without being told to I say
"Hey Soandso, Tsu is ML - leave the bodies".  Guy loots
again "Okay, sorry you couldn't stay with us"
/target soandso  /disband.  Actually had to do it a couple
of times.

Also remember that Beach always carried 'dots around for
clerics to symbol him with, and was able to grab agro as
only a ranger intent on it can :)  No one in our close circle
allowed a cleric to get beat on for any amount of time, even
our wizard friend who'd go to full burn to pull the mob off.
In return, we damn well expected to be rezzed when (not if)
we died.  Heh, we used to fight fast and hard.

I played organized B-Ball from the time I was 6 to the
time I was 30 (and blew out my knee).  Grouping in EQ became
the replacement for the kind of close teamwork you develop
on the court.  I always felt you owed your team mate your
all on the court, and that the same is true in EQ.  So you
can see where my feeling that you do not abandon your team
mates comes from.

I'd no more condone a cleric not rezzing a groupmate, than
a team mate who didn't play D, who shot too much and didn't
pass or who didn't hit the boards.  These are basic things
that you simply *DO* you should not have to be told, they
are not optional - they form the core of your contribution
to your team.  Anyone who thinks that they don't have to rez
or heal a groupmate simply does not belong on my team,
because they don't understand what a team is.

Heh, enough rambling - I have work I'm supposed to be doing.
what it comes  down to is that

A.  The Group leader failed his group by not controlling
the speed looter to begin with.

B.  The speed looter failed his group by being a loot whore.

C.  The OP failed his team by abandoning them after he'd
committed to fighting with them.
