I gig Athalon, 512 MB Memory runs great with the new models, With alowly 
Geforce 2 Mx card and 56K Modem. The PC is own built. I would go so far 
to say that since the latest patches its running faster than pre Luc 
models.

All I can think is if you haven't got the latest drivers try that, but 
it doesn't seem right. I've also checked texture caching on - even 
though they recommend not for 512MB or more. Worth trying.

Have you tried benchmarking the PC?
