Because I'm -bored-, man.  I buff everyone up, then they tell me not to 
mezz anything, they'd rather offtank.  Don't slow anything, the shaman 
will do that.  And it only takes one enchanter to do the tashes.  And for 
god's sake, don't use those nasssty nukes that push the mob around!  Not 
that our nukes do much more damage than the pet would.  But still, it 
would be doing something, feeling like I'm making some positive 
contribution, and am not just a warm body filling up the roster.

Let me have my weeny pet, so I can at least feel like I'm doing 
-something-.  Otherwise, I may as well just go /afk, wait for the rez, and 
bid on the loot.

I'd be perfectly happy to charm something, of course, but then, I -still- 
wouldn't have /pet hold.  And if they don't want a pet without /pet hold, 
I'm -sure- they don't want a pet without /pet hold that can break charm...

You're right.  Not paying atention for a few moments is definitely not 
worth the risk to the raid.  I hereby volunteer to not do that, when I 
have a pet up.

>I have a pet, I don't have pet discipline, I don't use my pet on raids.  
>Doesn't bother me in the least.

*Shrug* I pop mine up sometimes when I'm probably not supposed to, and 
don't see any harm come from it.  So then I wonder -why- I'm not supposed 
to.
