This happens to my Brother, on all bar one of his family's accounts.

In his case, no, because one account works! But EQIM has the same firewall
restrictions as EQ does (posted on EQLive somewhere).

This is from the EQLive Tech Forum, in case it helps:

Problem posted on EQLive Tech Help Forum:

  I can't even seem to log into it, it says invalide login. I can still log
in to EQ though. Any ideas?

  Response (from a player):

  Change your password, run EQ and select account then change password. I
have 2 accounts with the same password and neither one would work, I changed
my password and all is fine. I figure this is something with new encryption
that they are using, not sure though.
