Oops nm, don't know what I was thinking before.

Yeah, you can do the old Log in Log out multiquest. You log both
characters there, each with a head at quest guy. You have the gnome
sit, give him the head and camp. You then immediately log on the dwarf
and give the other head and get the bloodforge armor. Or really any
order since the armor is not no drop.

My druid and my cleric did something similar for the no drop caddecus
of sacrement quest and for jboots ;)
