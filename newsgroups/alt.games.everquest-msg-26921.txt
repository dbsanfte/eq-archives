I know that others know the answer to this off the top of their heads but
just in case you want to play TONIGHT I'll toss out an answer.

EQDEVICE.TXT

What does it have in there?  Rename it to something else and crank up EQ &
see what it does.

I also know that it's very important to follow the directions on how to
uninstall your Voodoo and install your GeForce...hopefully you did that.
