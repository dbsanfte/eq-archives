OK. In the interests of exhaustion, I'll push the argument a stage further.
You're a level 25 Ranger pulling a Rook in SK. You Snare it AND hit it with
Flame Lick. I see it trotting past and drop a 180 Frost Shock on it. You
think I won't pull it if I'm stood there doing that kind of damage to it?
Cloud cuckoo-land...

If it's running, then there's no excuse. I agree. It's obviously engaged
with someone.

If it's walking and you've seen someone hit it, or it's obvious that
someone's pulling it, there's still NO excuse.

If you're innocently hitting something at full health that appears to be
walking, then there's little you can do. I've run these ones over to the
person I robbed and rooted them nearby to apologise and pass them back, and
I've dropped them as I started and then pulled the next to them after
telling them of my intentions.

It's common courtesy. "I saw it first" doesn't really cut it if you're going
to get along nicely.
