Perhaps because "you are being inspected" is so often followed by "you have lots
of stuff, gimme some plat or some stuff" or "sell me <insert item you are
currently using>" messages? Beggars often inspect their targets first. It's too
bad that disabling the inspect spam won't disable the beggar as well.
