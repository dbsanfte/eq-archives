My Erudite Necro is level 16.  You start off KoS in Qeynos but not the
catacombs.  You are apprehensive to Fp Militia, and Coalition of ill.,
Dubious to Knights of Truth (guards in N. FP) and common residents.  You
start out Dubious to the Elves in Kelethin Felwithe, but without killing
orcs you won't be able to do any quests to raise faction either.  You
are KoS to the Dwarf Guards in BB, Indiff to Citizens.  You are KoS to
Gnomes, except for the Necro guild which you start out amiable to.  You
start out dubious (might have been apprehensive to necros) to pretty
much all of neriak/nek forest.  there is no way to raise your faction
with the necro guild there, but they will sell to you.  You can raise
the merchants, dread guard inner and outer however with the red wine
quest, with the guy off the library.  After a backpack or so of wine, my
erudite necro is allied to the merchants, amiable to dread guard inner
and apprehensive to dread guard outer.  If you decide to raise your
faction with the Elves you will need to avoid the Warrior guild in
Neriak, but that's not hard to do.  You are KoS in Halas or at least to
the guards, in Everfrost, never went into the city.  You are dubious to
all factions in Rivervale EXCEPT for the Cleric guild which is KoS.  The
cleric guild is right by the Kith forest zone, They don't see invis
though.  You can bank but can't sell in Rivervale.  You are KoS in
HHP/HHK.  You are KoS to trolls and ogres.  Not sure beyond that but i
think that covers most city factions anyways.
