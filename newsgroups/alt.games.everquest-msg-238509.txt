Hmm. My epic, my blessed coldain shawl, my lavastone ring (never saw
anyone else with that on my server, I'd have farmed it if I played
longer). Was damned proud of my circlet of the falinkan, my gloves of
earthcrafting and my belt of the wanderer back in the day, too. And my
hierophant cloak from a GM event, which I handed over to my mage when
I upgraded it. Cap of drowned souls gets special mention for being my
nemesis - I was after it actively for half a year and finally got it 2
weeks before I left the game :)

If I ever should play again (not counting on it), I'd more than likely
switch mains. Upgrading Cel would require more raiding hours in a
large guild than I'd ever care to do, and to be honest I find that
when I look at top end gear the numbers all become meaningless.
