Foxy,
Paladins and Shadowknights have tanked Avatar of War, Warders in ST, most of
North ToV, Xanamech, and other fairly serious mobs in my personal
experience.  If the guild makes a concerted effort to help him get the
equipment and skills to do the job, a Knight can stand up to a great deal.
There may come a time when your friend has to step aside for a warrior - but
it'll be in the Elemental Planes or so.  Plenty of time...
