The change to make charmed pets break charm as soon as their master dies
seems to be what's doing this, indirectly.

The 'fix' seems to have involved changing the order in which things happen
while zoning, and my guess is that in some cases, the new order allows heals
to land before the "He's dead Jim" hits, so the server sends you an update
that he's at 40% hp, when he's really dead, and it never gets around to
telling you he's dead.

(note this is just speculation on my part)

Does targetting the corpse after zoning out still show it at 40% ?
