I have to side with Richard here.  I fail to see how anybody's gaming
experience is enhanced by the "roleplay opportunity" of spendinf an hour
waiting for a response to "paying for bind at XXX, please send tell"
ooc'd and shouted at five minute intervals, followed by logging off the
game in disgust.  This is not a roleplay opportunity, it is a pointless
impediment to gameplay

Only if the price is truly extortionate.  Say level squared times the
xp fraction restored (i.e. 50% rez for a L50 would be 50^^2*.50=1250pp).

Kaev
still able to count times xp rez received on one hand at L50
