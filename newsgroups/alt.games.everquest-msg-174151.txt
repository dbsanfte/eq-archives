At least I know how to *spell* it properly...

But I see you're fixated on "propoganda [sic]", you've been
ranting about it for several days now.

Unlike you, Ben, I prefer actual evidence and informed reasoning.

Ah, so you admit it *is* possible to think that leaving
Saddam in power in 91' was a mistake, *without* it being
"proof" of being a "grab-the-oil conspirator" (as you had
previously asserted).  Ben, that ringing sound you hear
is the clue phone.

Sigh.  Ben, do I *really* need to dig out for you all the
zillions of editorials and public statements by various world
leaders back in '91 saying that the situation simply didn't
allow going after Saddam, no matter how much that might be
a Good Thing?  The fact that it was politically impossible
to do so, both domestically and internationally, is one of the
best established facts of the Gulf War.

If you're seriously trying to dispute that, or imply that
I need to document it somehow, then quite frankly you're
a fucking idiot.

As someone said in another context, "You're not qualified to
even comment anymore until you inform yourself."

Ben, this is a classic example of the fallacy of "begging
the question" (or "petitio principii" since you're being
pretentious and reverting to Latin).

Begging the question is quite popular among paranoid 
crackpots, BTW.

You start with the unsupported *premise* that they have
"no casus belli" (brushing off the many reasons given
here in this thread), then use this "fact" in support of
your conclusion that since they have no casus belli (you
believe) then therefore it "must" be about oil.

Sheesh -- that not only presumes the conclusion (hint,
you need to *establish* that they have no casus belli,
you can't just presume it, because that's what you're trying
to prove), it also includes the false choice fallacy,
wherein you try to jump directly from "there's no casus
belli" to "it must therefore be oil" (as opposed to
other sorts of possible motives).

You're arguing in circles here:

Ben:  "It's all about oil".

      "Oh?  Why can't it be about 9/11 and national safety?"

Ben:  "Don't be a fool, we know it's not about that because
      it's about oil, and since it's not about 9/11,
      it's obviously about oil.  Are you dense?"

Don't presume to lecture *me* on "doing the math", Ben.

Why are you lying, Ben?

Let's check what you actually wrote:

# If you meant this to show that it wasn't about oil ("we didn't go
# because it wasn't about oil!"), you accomplished the exact opposite.

"The exact opposite" of "showing that it wasn't about oil"
is "showing that it is about oil".  You claimed that his
point (we didn't finish off Saddam in 91) showed that it
*is* about oil.

You didn't say he failed at his argument, you said he
"accomplished the exact opposite".  That's quite a different
thing.  Your meaning was entirely clear.

Don't run away from your statements just because they
turn out to be idiotic.  Retract them, or try to defend them,
but don't lie about what you actually said.

Don't be a dickhead, Ben.  I know what he can do with his oil.
It's just that that doesn't support your point, since
we didn't in any way force Iraq to use its oil to serve *our*
oil needs.  We're just ensuring that he doesn't use the revenues
to build back up his war machine, which is a different
thing entirely.

Was that really so hard?

And before you trot out some silly theory about us limiting
Iraq's oil production to moderate OPEC and oil prices, let
me point out that Iraq is currently already producing at
very near their max capacity.  Nor are they prohibited
from *cutting* production if they choose (they shut off
the taps in 2000 and again in 2002, for example), nor
is there a *cap* on how much they can sell (all limits
were removed in 1999).

So, please, what the fuck was your point again?

Ben, let me give you a lesson in how not to make an
ass of yourself:  Most people, when they're trying to
argue a point, actually present some facts and then
explain how they relate to the point they're trying
to make.  They don't just say "you're ignorant so I win"
in a lame attempt to imply that they've got support
for their evidence somewhere, but they're not going
to bother showing it to anyone.

Repeat:  The brain-dead "no blood for oil" folks were
revealed to be morons when we got an unconditional surrender
from Iraq, and *didn't* bother to grab their oil.  Period.
No amount of dancing will change that.

Oh, so they were stupid the first time, but by gosh
*now* their identical mantra will prove true because
nothing is ever the same way twice?
Forgive me if I don't find that very convincing.


> Or did Iraq invade Kuwait while we were playing EQ?

No, you idiot.  But if you can't grasp that 3000 dead
people in the heart of New York is going to change
how the US views and deals with weapons of mass
destruction in the hands of people who hate us,
then you're *entirely* beyond reason.

9/11 was a *bigger* event than Iraq invading Kuwait,
you hopeless dolt.  What sort of blindness makes
you incapable of grasping that, or apparently even
forgetting that it happened, as your clueless
comment above implies?


>You'd go start a war without cause and keep terrorism going strong.

No, I wouldn't.

Go ahead, Ben -- tell us about the Jewish bankers.
That's one of my favorite fairy tales.

Ben, you really are a jackass.

I formulate my opinions based on thirty years of constantly
following current events, double-checking facts for myself,
debating them with informed people on various political
discussion boards (this current thread has *not* risen
to the level of "informed people"), comparing competing
claims from various sides of the political fence to
see which hold water on a given issue, reading articles
in the foreign press, studying history, and so on.

If you don't like my conclusions, tough shit, but you're
just being childish by trying to dismiss them as being
the product of not thinking for myself.

You, on the other hand, parrot the empty-headed liberal
party line ("blood for oil, blood for oil, *squawk*!").
It's as if you're channeling that deep political 
analyst, Barbra Streisand.  When challenged
on various points, you dodge, dance, namecall, go
off on a tangent, declare victory, repeat your assertions 
as if restating them will give them any more weight,
or even cluelessly provide information that undercuts
your own point.

I grow very weary of it.


> How much do you pay the Republican coffers
>a year, I wonder, mr oil man?

Not a dime, child, but that sure is another fine example
of your empty sloganeering and sneering when you should
be trying to argue your position.  And the fact that
you consider the question or its answer to be even
remotely relevant to supporting your position or
refuting mine speaks volumes about you.

If you can keep that knee from jerking, maybe you'll
be able to think more clearly.
