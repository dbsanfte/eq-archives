missed the beginning of this thread but here goes ..

Scott, listen up ..

Ever bought a bag of candy and had a free chance to win something inside?
Ever opened a box of Cracker Jacks and gotten a free toy/sticker inside?
Ever bought a new piece of computer hardware and gotten some free software
with it?
(For that matter, did your computer come with the OS and software, or did
you buy it all yourself, separately?)
Ever bought a car that had seat covers, an engine, or a rear view mirror in
it? Or did you buy all those separately?
Ever bought a computer game that had other games by the same company on the
CD?

See where the idea is headed?
