I leave the band on to prevent finger-staining. Seems I read somewhere that
cigar bands were originally designed for that purpose.

Here's a tidbit I culled from cigars.about.com:

To Remove or Not to Remove the Band


There is much debate about this topic. Many folks say it is bad etiquette to
keep it on others say it doesn't matter. In Europe, particularly in England,
it is considered bad etiquette to keep the band on. The reason is that
people feel like they are flaunting their cigars, sort of like wearing name
brand clothing. In early America, when men used to wear white gloves, they
preferred to keep the band on so that they wouldn't dirty their gloves. So
in the US it doesn't seem to matter. There are many reasons you want to keep
the band on, in my opinion. It helps identify which is the right side up of
your cigar ( I have seen people almost put the lit end of the cigar in their
mouths), your fingers don't get hot, it helps you decide when to stop
smoking, and most importantly, it helps keep your wrapper secure. If you do
remove the band I recommend you light your cigar and smoke it for a few
minutes before doing so. This helps the wrapper get a little warm and it
loosens the band. Cigar manufacturers use a vegetable gum to secure the
wrapper and labels and sometimes they get stuck together. Warming up your
cigar before removing the label relieves this problem. I personally don't
mind knowing what other people smoke and it usually starts a good
conversation, how do you like that brand? etc. So, again it's all a matter
of choice. I wouldn't spend too much time fretting about it. It's not worth
it. You have your cigar don't you? Who cares about the band!!
