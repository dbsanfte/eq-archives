I went through this same search. IVU for others is not the same as the
IVU for WIZ.   Looked at Caster's Realm and saw the list for vendors.
Had a friend online in Skyshrine and asked if he could grab one for
me.  It wasn't there. Unless something has changed since I got mine,
it is only a drop spell.  Anyone that managed to get it at the vendor
was lucky and picked up a scroll that someone unloaded there after
looting it from a MOB.

I finally managed to get it at auction in EC.

Good luck
