No, it does not.  And try "rebuts" next time.

First, I never said that he does it "ALL THE TIME".  Bizbee
is either suffering from enormously bad reading comprehension,
or he's clumsily engaging in a dishonest "straw man" argument
(where one lies about the opponent's position and then
rebuts the false accusation instead of the real one).  This
alone makes Bizbee's alleged "rebuttal" an invalid one,
since he is declaring my evidence insufficient because it
does not support AN ABSOLUTE STATEMENT THAT I NEVER MADE.

Second, I SPECIFICALLY had said in my original comment
(the one that made Bizbee go ballistic and insist on
"proof") that Bizbee had not flamed any innocent bystanders
recently.  So the fact that my examples are older ones
certainly doesn't invalidate them, since the point
under contention was whether Bizbee had EVER DONE SO IN
THE PAST.

Third, he was so adamant in his "oh my god I'm being
accused unfairly", that he confidently claimed that
he doubted I'd be able to come up with even ONE example.
I came up with what, seven?

Fourth, you apparently did not read my post very
carefully, or you would have seen that I pointed out
that Bizbee has taken steps to make sure that NONE
OF HIS OLDER POSTS CAN BE RETRIEVED, which needless
to say makes it much more difficult to compile
examples.  Nonetheless, I came up with quite a few
without much looking, and could find even more if
anyone really wants to see them.

So since the passage of Bizbee's that you quote above
boils down to, "the examples are old" (which is not
a valid defense), and "if I do it often, why aren't
there more" (which is not a valid defense, I'm not
going to spend days of research on this little spat,
and Bizbee asserted that there wouldn't be ANY)
and finally "you didn't prove I do it ALL THE TIME"
(which is a cheap shot because I *never* made
that claim and thus don't need to support it), then
it appears that Bizbee has no leg left to stand on.

And neither do you, unless you can come up with
anything better in Bizbee's non-rebuttal.


> You made a
>generalization, and cannot substaniate it.

I most certainly did "substaniate [sic]" it.

First, read my long post which lists multiple times when 
Bizbee flamed people for no apparent reason.  This is
sufficient proof, because Bizbee claimed in effect,
"I never do that", and even a single example (much less
the several I posted) is a valid proof of, "yes you do".

Bizbee did not adequately defend these examples of
his behavior, other than to get incoherently obscene and
scream about me being a "pinhead".

One he lamely "defended" by saying that
he didn't like the target of his blast.  Another he
"defended" by saying that it was a stupid question,
not realizing that in the example the question had
been asked BY BIZBEE HIMSELF, as I had made abundantly clear.
Another he "defended" by simply asking me incredulously
if someone asking the newsgroup how to deal with a jerk
in-game was a "legitimate" question (which of course
it is), without explaining why exactly he felt it was
*not* and deserved the sort of response he gave it.
None of these "defenses" are valid, they are simple
rhetorical hand-waving, they are bluster, they are
an attempt at declaring Bizbee's flames to be so
self-evidently righteous that they need no actual
defense other than to gasp over the fact that I
considered them uncalled for on Bizbee's part.

And so on.  Ridiculing the examples without explaining
precisely *what* is wrong with them, or what makes
them (allegedly) invalid, does not count as a "rebuttal".
A rebuttal has a strict definition:

    re-but (ri but')  v. <-but-ted, -but-ting>
              v.t. 
            1.  to refute by evidence or argument.
            2.  to oppose by contrary proof.

Responding with ridicule is not a rebuttal.  Responding
with multiple variations of "go to hell!" is not a rebuttal.
Responding with namecalling is not a rebuttal.  Calling
the examples invalid without explaining specifically
*why* they are actually invalid is not a rebuttal.

Bizbee has yet to rebut my response.  I doubt he ever will.


>I am not defending BIZBEE. Just pointing out that he answered your
>claim and your small offering of proof.

Oh, yes, he "answered it".  A child screaming "FUCK YOU!" has
"answered" the charge that he has broken a lamp and the evidence
against him.  But he certainly hasn't rebutted it, has he?
