Some people tend to look down on it, can't tell you why, other than, the 
fact that they will be used to posting on the EMarr forums, and not know 
the norms of posting to usenet.  Not all of them, but, many.  In addition 
to that, we will get a sudden influx of the dregs of the EMarr forums in 
addition to the many nice, friendly types.
