    I saw that once. 8) The wandering guards in Qeynos were in just the
right position, and the gate guards had been pulled to the side by a fleeing
person who was unwise with his AoE placement. For the record: Fippy runs
into town, runs all the way past the Temple of Life complex to the zone to
the other half of Qeynos, then starts back. At which point he intersected
the path of a wandering guard.
