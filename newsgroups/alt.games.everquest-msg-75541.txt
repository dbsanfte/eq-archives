That's RIGHT!
I love it... people in EQ genuinely cooperate... Sometimes you'll find
people being downright evil... luring newbies into bad areas, promising
group buffs only to actually be porting to someplace horrid... etc.,  very
rare.

Just yesterday I had a cleric or someting (hard to tell since she was so
shiney) buff me to Vice-God status.... as a 16th level Druid, I all of the
sudden had an almost bottomless mana supply, almost 1000 hit points and they
were all regenerating at a high rate!  Wow!

Woot.. love the coop EQ... ;)  Us against the MOB... of course, experiences
may vary on PvP servers.
