Hehe, not always. My druid dont have it yet, and i got some smartass 
druid cast it on me when i hunted in CS. Nice of him if it wasnt for the 
fact that the spell got same stacking problem as Dead Man Floating (dont 
know if they fixed that one), so SoE overwrite your Levitate, but if 
youre already levitating you do NOT get a levi, and you can not cast it 
on yourself again because you already got a better spell.
So all i got from a druid tryig to be helpfull was 400 fall damage, and 
some lost mana because i had to remove SoE and cast sow and levi on 
myself again.
