LOL, I've lived with this since I was a kid, so have long since
forgotten the medical term. What it amounts to is that if two shades of
the same color are close enough in the spectrum, then to my eyes they
look the same. I have particular difficulty with shades of blue, so
lucky me to be an EQ addict! As an example, in that picture linked
above, I can read the bottom text, but didn't "see" that there was top
text until I showed it to a friend who was visiting.
