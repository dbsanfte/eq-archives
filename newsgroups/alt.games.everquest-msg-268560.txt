Judging from the observations made on various boards (EQ server boards, the
official EQLive boards, class sites, etc), most EQ(1) servers have lost (on
average) somewhere between 20 - 30% of their population at the moment. Trouble
is, if 20% of a (non-zerg) guild leaves, said guild has to either recruit
replacements or fold. If it folds, some people will look for new guilds and
others will just quit - hastening the decline. Vicious circle.

SOE really ought to start seriously considering either drastically reducing
the cost of servermoves, or just start merging servers.
