Ok, right now my severely-non-uber guild us basically doing 2 DKP per raid,
and 1 DKP per "boss" bonus.  As far as DKP costs, it's strictly on a bid
basis (as well as need, but that's unofficial).  Of course, we need to grab
additional people to even take the arena, as we're almost up to a shadow of
our former selves, so larger guilds can help more than this.
