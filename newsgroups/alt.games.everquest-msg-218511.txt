Ive done a few AoE groups as both an enchanter and as a wizard. ITs
real important that the chanter stay alive during this because the
chain stunning is sure to generate aggro. Sometimes they resist and
whack you. If you get stunned from these whacks then the others
recover and whack you as well and you drop quick. Ive had that happen
in PoJ trials. With one healer and one puller you dont have time for
the healer to switch targets because the puller is usually in dire
need of a heal when he gets back. So for a good AoE group i recommend
2 chanters. Also try to avoid areas with mobs that harmtouch and
caster mobs. The sk's damage the puller too much before he can get
back and the casters get out of stun range too much. You want plenty
of plain old melee mobs. Sebilis and City of Mist are cool. Also, we
would take turns looting. its fun to loot 25 mobs in sebilis because
they got lots of gems and spells.

my ideal setup is:

epic wizard puller
wizard
wizard
enchanter
enchanter
cleric


ive also done it with
paladin
mage
wizard
druid
enchanter
cleric

but it wasnt near as efficient.
