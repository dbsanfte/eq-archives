Not that feedback here does any good, but I hadn't seen any mention of
the temporary content.

Overall I was impressed, it was nice to see people in the old world
again, camping 'classic mobs'. Its amazing just how little change was
required to generate interest in the stuff.

Personally, I think they should leave the fabled mobs *in*. Randomly
popping, and despawning after a while if they're unengaged to prevent
level appropriate groups from being forced out of the areas once
they're up.

It adds something to the game, and so much of the game is worth taking
a look at, if all it takes is one or two quality drops in each old
zone to generate interest in adventuring around instead of just
playing in the new content, then there is really no excuse to pull
them out.
