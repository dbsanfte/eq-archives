    Huh?! Low to mid? What that you been smokin' there friend? Jaggedpine is
far from low to mid level... even the Jaggedpine critters must run somewhere
in the low 30's, and good luck with that if you ever came upon a situation
where QRG Protected Animals was ever lowered, despite the 'Jaggedpine
Critters' faction.
    I've found that my faction with Jaggedpine Critters is the same as with
QRG Protected Animals, which ain't all that good... and since killing the
critters lowers a ton of Jaggedpine factions... well, u get the picture.
    The critters aggro, forcing you to die, run or kill them, and if you do
then your Jaggedpine factions take a hit. Oh, and don't go running to the
guards for help, they remind me of Holly Windstalker, and they don't like it
much if you're dubious or less with them.
    Get the general feeling there? At 47 there are a few critters that are
still light blue to me who decided to aggro me after about 10 seconds of my
first zone-in to Jaggedpine, which was about after 10 minutes of it going
live, so I waste 'em and take not just a few bad faction hits. All of a
sudden I go from indifferently to dubious with the guards (who knows how
close it was, Treants and I didn't see eye to eye much)... then I proceed to
move about a bit more carefully which resulted in a death and a crap CR (I
was bound in the world port room, not too bad, but still).
    Some little freak of a NPC that I can't remember the name of near a
bandit camp toasted me in like 2 casts. Then I find I have aggroed a wolf to
the port-out loc and he bites me in the butt right after I get a rez and
loot. Next thing I know I am hopping around trying to click the port while a
few guards are slicing my haircut a bit shorter.
    Low to mid? NOT

Why can't I reply when it asks me "What would you like your tombstone to
say"?
