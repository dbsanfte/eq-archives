I dont think that YALP violates any EULA clause, nor does it do
anything funny. All it is really is a fancy file viewer for the
EQLOG*.* files that EverQuest spits out. So I cant imagine anybody
getting upset about people using it. Believe me, the last thing I want
is to be banned from EQ for doing anything wrong... How would I spend
my after dinner time without EQ?

Happy EQ'ing...
