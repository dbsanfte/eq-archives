I am 100% with you. I am addicted and i find it very hard to stay away from the
game. It is so sad that when im with my girlfriend almost all the time i think
about EQ. I find it boring to be with my girlfriend most of the time except when
i know i cant go on my pc. Heres an example : The other day my power supply
exploded. This means i couldnt open my pc. No pc, no EQ. Know what? I wasnt mad,
I wasnt crying. Actually i was happy. I was happy that I had no choice but to do
something else, bring my girl outside for a meal, do sports with friends (I used
to live for sports), It even felt great just to sit on a chair outside on a
sunny day. Thats some of the things I almost never do cause as soon as i have
some spare time, i run for the PC. I felt like i was living a new life. I
enjoyed being with my girlfriend. Thanks god i have her cause i'd be an hermit.
Now that my PC is repaired, im back in EQ, i dream EQ, i eat EQ, i think EQ, im
here, reading a newsgroup about EQ while working. At least I try to play mainly
on weekdays. I take week-ends for partying, sex, beer...:P .I feel lucky that i
could manage to keep all my friends and loved ones (even though my gf HATE
"Eva-Quest" like she says..)since i started in beta. I left the game for about a
year and wanted to give Kunark a try...MISTAKE. Im about to start my own
business and i dont want EQ to destroy it all. EQ is a drug and i need to work
on some ways to quit the game. I wish i could loose all my characters or
equipment but i just dont have the guts to delete it all. I think the magic word
here is: Moderation...for now. :)

Boat!! ;)

PS: Im french so dont bitch about the spelling mistakes. ;P
