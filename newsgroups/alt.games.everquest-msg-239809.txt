It's probably best to farm spiderling silks and buy cheap lq hides; the new
ui should tell you which ones work when you do a search on padding. You
shouldn't pay more than 10 each. The real costs are the molds and the folded
metal; ironically i use to fold the sheets and try to sell them, but noone
ever bought them. The bazaar sells spiderling for incredible prices, so
*avoid*.

I remember back in my porting days, i offerred to port a couple of monks,
who said they had nothing to offer as a donation. I said that a few
spiderling silks would have been nice. (This was before the drop rate was
nerfed). They laughed, saying that 8 level monks shouldn't have to kill
level 3 mobs.

At level 56, I'm still killing those level 3 mobs ;-)
