It's a simple concept...

You either support Terrorism or you don't..

There is no such thing as supporting terrorism here and there, but NOT
supporting terrorism there or here...

So, if you support the Palestinian Terrorism, then you by default MUST
support the 9/11 attacks and all other terrorism..

It's logic...  pure and simple...
