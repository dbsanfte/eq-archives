    How will we get to Luclin (exact method, please describe in detail if
you know, and providing source of info/screenshots would be appreciated as
well).  Also how will we know where the transportation locations are?  I
would say to not install it until after you download the first patch.  That
should give some clue (like the NRO file being downloaded as the a patch
just before or about when Velious went live).  I'd say one of the following.
1) Today's patch will reveal the locations.
2) The first live patch will reveal the locations.
3a) They were a little more cruel and secretly snuck it into a patch a while
ago and its already there, but wont be active until a certain date.
3b) Same as above, only instead of a zone file being downloaded the file is
downloaded in some other form and either when you run EQ.EXE file that
renames/replaces the proper zone file, or it has the needed porting info in
it.
4) They become extremely cruel, same situation as 3a & 3b (they don't tell
us what zones the ports are in), only they are even more cruel and filter
all text for 48 hours except for /say to prevent us from /shout /auction
/ouch /gsay or any other mass communication methods to spread word of the
port locations.
