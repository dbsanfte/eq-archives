My Beastlord (Nuetral Good Tribunal) is currently Indifferent to all
of Paineel. I would guess that it took me at lest 600-800 kills to get
there. KoS--Threat didn't take very long. Threat-Dubious took about 3x
as long. Dub-Indiff was about as long as KoS to Threat. You should be
close to Indiff, hang in there.

At DUB you can bank in Paineel. Your only problem is getting in. Find
a newbie Evil Erudite and offer them a couple of gold to open the door
for you. Once inside you can go and bank. Then simply gate back to the
pool area near the Warrens Entrance (assuming you have bound yourself
there.

Don't give up now. You are almost there :-) Once you are in with
Paineel you can use it as your home base. Hunt in the Warrend until
the EXP dries up and then move on to Stonebrunt.
