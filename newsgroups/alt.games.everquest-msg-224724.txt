Hits for 73 i believe max, and misses about half the time. I use it 
occasionaly because those hits do help if we have another pet or 2 
tanking. My game husband and i camped for my last shard in skyfire, so 
we had a 52 BL pet, and a 62 shammy pet and my wimpy hammer. I ended up 
tanking because once Gordiner and I were buffed up, we and our pets were 
running through the mobs in about a minute or so per mob. i can say that 
i finally maxed out 1hb and 2hb that way=)

Hm, i should go play with the gobbies=) Sounds like a fun way to kill a 
tuesday morning. [I farm zones when they are empty, i dont like taking 
mobs that others can get xp from if I can help it. I found that there 
are a lot of people who will pay 5750 for a bag of the tinkerer, so i 
have been pacifying in, buying up 5 bags, killing my way out to load up 
on ore and sellables, then gating out and selling off the goodies, then 
auctioning the bags. I can usually manage about 3-3.5 k plat on a good 
trip if i sell all 5 bags=)
aru
now if there was a bank in there=)
