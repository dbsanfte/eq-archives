I don't know about cleric soloing.. but where i cut my teeth necro
soloing was on these giants. IIRC, i took down a frost giant
elite(when they were red) at 42 or so.. and died many times trying it
until i got the process down... after that they were cake and giants
are a great way to practice all the various soloing techniques on(fear
kite, agro kite, root/rot, etc). There are also varying levels of
giant from (in order of hardness) scout to berzerker to elite. Scouts
on the book side of the valley should be soloable by most any class
that can solo at 43. Did have some problems with the warping..
undercons weren't an issue, and wtf do you mean by breath attack?
Nearly every giant I ran into was straight melee.

Either way, if you are looking for a place to learn how to solo you
can't get much better. Open area so sow potions or jboots are your
friend, close to book in case you're a class that needs kei, rezzes
are relatively easy to get by simply dragging to book and asking
clerics in PoK nicely, and when the giants fall they do a nice facial
that is fun to watch, no matter how many times you've done it.
