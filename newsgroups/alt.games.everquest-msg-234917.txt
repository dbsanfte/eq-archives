Adastraea has caught up to Rabotev. Not in actual 
levels, of course, he still has a good seven levels
on her, but she's hunting in the same area he is - 
Dulak, in the corral near the Oceancrasher dock.
  In a recnet thread someone claimed Dulak was tough 
territory, the mobs underconned badly. I suspect this 
was trying to throw the OP off to keep the gold mine
clear. In my experience Dulak mobs have the fewest 
hit points of anything at their levels. At the zone 
in, Ada was able to solo easily from 44 to 48. Now
she has to go deeper in, and will be doing Oceancrasher
initiates and engineers for a while.
  (Note: The dark elves at the zone in use their 
coloration to great advantage. This is how natural 
camoflauge works - you have the same color as your 
background. They aren't actually using their DE Hide
ability, nor are they under magical invis; they are 
just very hard to see. Great little trick, but if you
spend time there you know where they are stationed and
what to look for.)
  Both Rab and Ada are going to be working on their
quad kiting skill; you have to clear a space for it,
but if you can keep it clear you can gain experience
at noticeable speed.
  Once Ada reaches 51, I'll likely spend more time on 
other characters; Tosev needs work in CC, and Neuveniu
will be going into her mid-30's at SF ramp in OT.
  All of this starts, of course, after downloading GoD,
which will take a good 10 hours or so on my slow
connection, followed by the inevitable patches to fix
what went wrong with the main load...
