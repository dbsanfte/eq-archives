HI folks,  Thanks for all the help.
I have done a bit of research, but I have not answered one of my most
pressing questions.

I am a lvl14 Ranger, and currently using a Gladius 1HS sword.  It
seems to be ok ,  but with 2500pp in the bank, I think I can do
better.  
Can you guys reccommend something for a lvl 14-20 ranger, and THEN
what I sould strive for after that?

Only interested in 1HS weapons at this point.

(currently using the "Marr's Promise"  way to heavy  it seems, so i'll
be switching that out too.)

THANKS FOR THE HELP!
-Sparky
