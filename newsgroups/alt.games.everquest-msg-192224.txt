My actual character's name is Krikit, after Cricket, a demonic feline
I happen to own. I'm on the RP server, so, your disdain for silly
names is shared. (Even so, I've seen plenty...) The thread subject was
an attempt to be light-hearted...

Thanks to the person who suggested changing my alpha settings. I
figured it was patch related; I just wasn't sure whether Vah Shir had
been changed, or if there was a bug involved in vision settings.
