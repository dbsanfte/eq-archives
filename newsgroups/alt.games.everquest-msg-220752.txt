Truth is the hard part was the only citys that did not have free run
of Barb city frog and lizard (NOTE hafling city was a problem with
clierc Guild in the way of going in.) 
lenny at time of re-roll can train in dwarf Gnome and wood elf citys
show me another oger that was trainable by the war guild leader of the
Dwarf city.

 54 day play time just trying to make myself liked by good citys (may
even have been the first Ogre on FV to go into the tree elf city. 

was fun running round the tree elf city or hanging out in the high elf
city hell even knew all the speaks to master. for a ogre War that was
allso to be proud of

I miss lenny ogre but should have fun now with me ogre Shadow knight
