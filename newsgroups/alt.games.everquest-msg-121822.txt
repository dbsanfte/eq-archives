Actually the problem wasn't as much of NEEDING the healing, it was one
bitchy player of the "SoW NOW d00d" mentality (like I said, he left upon
dieing, and came back to nuke the camp before getting board & leaving myself
and the group to another 2.5 hours of EXP with FEW needed heals).  He was
the ONLY one who had a problem with staying alive.  The others were doing
quite good at helping out and keeping the damage taking low, while keeping
the damage doing high.
    And yesterday I did choose to solo, not because of the group, but
because I can solo faster (at 14) than 1 bubble an hour (was getting half a
blue bub for every blue con mummy and most blue con crocks).  When a group
is fighting almost nothing but what you can solo one after another (with
nearly no medding) on a single buffed pet (that never goes below 40% HP),
it's time to solo again.
