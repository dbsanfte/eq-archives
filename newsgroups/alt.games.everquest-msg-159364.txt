 Not really relevant to my point. Although I can think of more than one
exception. Sleepers Tomb. Veeshans Peak. Any place in Ssra. Can you
imagine Druids quad-kiting golems in Sleepers Tomb? Me neither. Oh but
wait, Plane of Valor is outdoors therefore it should be quad-kiting
heaven! Most players I know, with the exception of Druids and Wizards,
think these mobs should summon. Hopefully Verant will see it as well.

 1 mob in the whole Velious expansion (although I'm sure there are other
exceptions as well). Sounds like you can still go around quad-kiting ice
burrowers! Good luck with that.

 I don't believe I attributed it to you.

 I don't think they are increasing mob abilities, they're just fixing
them to give them something they forgot to add. This isn't any magical
new ability, 51+ mobs, for the most part, have always summoned. For PoP
I'd give them 56+ since I'm feeling generous.

 It's the same for eveyone else. If you're a soloer, perhaps PoP isn't
the expansion for you.

 And you're just another whiny Druid who thinks soloing is your
god-given right. But hey, we could trade insults back and forth all day
if that will make you feel better. Seems to be the only way you can
communicate. But thanks for the psycho-analysis, Freud.

 Yeah, a group of melee will do real well in PoP zones. Heaven forbid we
invite slowers, buffers, or healers into groups these days. I don't know
about anyone else but I frequently have Druids and Wizards in my XP
groups.
