<<Man, there has to be *some* downside, like it or not. Otherwise, there is 
no incentive to formulate and execute strategy - no incentive to get better 
at what you do. Contrary to popular belief, the fastest route up through 
the levels is not necessarily the best.>>
By some downside, I assume you mean downtime or medding.  That's fine, I agree
there does have to be some downtime.  Unfortunately, I didn't like having a two
minute fight and then a 15 minute med with a rinse and repeat.  That's boring. 
Anything to speed up the time in between just makes the game more entertaining.
 How can anyone possibly want to have KEI nerfed???   Maybe SOE could start a
no buff server and then all you really talented guys who don't "need"  the help
of buffs could go play on it.  Fact is, any moron can succeed without the
buffs, the game isn't that hard,  we just don't want to.
