Norman Schwartskopf?  I'm pretty sure it wasn't Colin Powell . . . but I can
swear it was first said in conjunction with the Gulf War.

A guy with a military background will use military terminology.  McVeigh's
act was evil, but this statement is not.  "Collateral damage" simply means
those people and things not specifically meant to be impacted by a military
action that, becuase of their proximity to the target cannot practically be
insulated against the attack by the person or people carrying out that
action.  Note:  the implication is that McVeigh didn't want the children to
be hurt but thought it was "worth it" to accomplish his aims.  People like
you let sensationalist members of the media twist things like this for
maximum effect in a sound byte.

Why not take it another step and say that since Adolph Hitler believed in
Nietzche's "Ubermensch" (Overman or Superman), that watching the old
Superman TV series is tantamount to murdering select segments of our
society.  Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?  So does the implication you make.
