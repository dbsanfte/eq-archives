Well, like I said before, the problem is the only other option that
currently exists to stay alive is go exclusively pay-access. Simple
banner ads just don't pay off. (They claim they'll pay off, but only
for the number of people who actually click through, but most stiff on
the check.) You got a better way to do it, then I'm sure all the
website maintainers out there will be more than glad to hear it.
