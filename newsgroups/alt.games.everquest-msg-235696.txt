I am a newbie and starting off with several characters to try out. So I 
will post about each class here asking for ideas about best race to play 
for a given class, or at least the pros and cons of the available 
choices... Right now I am on Stromm but posted here for feedback on the 
new server.

For my Beastlord I rolled a Barbarian. I liked their strength and 
stamina. I've read though that a lot of people prefer to play a Vah Shir 
for their Beastlord and I am wondering why aside of the difference in 
the pet's looks. What are the pros and cons of these two races for 
Beastlord?

Although I think Ogres, Iksars and Trolls are cool (and their pets are 
very cool!) I don't think I'd consider those as I don't want the faction 
hassles associated with playing an evil character. At least not as a 
newbie player.
