Well I have to disagree. If you can't understand them, you don't 
speak English yourself. I've had dealings with customer support
which has been shipped over to India , and their English is excellent,
technically better than most North Americans. 

What they do lack is an understanding of the subtleties of the language, 
idioms and colloquialisms. If you speak good English to them you'll have
no probs whatsoever.

However, there is one problem, and it applies to just about all customer
support, in India or elsewhere. The lack of familiarity with the product by 
those trying to help. Customer support by looking at a flow chart on a pc 
screen just doesn't cut it.
