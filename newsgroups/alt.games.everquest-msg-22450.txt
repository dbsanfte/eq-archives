Agreed - Pathing exploit, pure and simple

I was headed through Skyshrine, heading to Yelinak with my guild. We
were almost there, when somehow, a golem and named dragon got agroed in
the room just before Yelinak's Lair. Being a tank, I grabbed the L65+
golem, taunted a few times to make sure it was locked on, and ran away
from the group. So, there's me and this 50ft golem, and we all know
who's gonna win. I just wanted to last long enough to camp a cleric out.
Then, suddenly, I wasn't getting hit any more. The golem wasn't behind
me... I took a step forward and a few seconds later the golem charged
around a corner and started on me again. A few steps back and he shot
off again (away from the group I might add). I sat and camped, came back
clean of agro (all other agroed had also camped by this time) and we
finished off the named one and carried on.

Was it a pathing exploit? Sure it was.
Could it have been RPed away? Sure - Golem obviously had pressing
matters to attend to in the library and figured someone else would take
care of the intruder

The long and short of it is, I don't feel bad about using an unknown
pathing bug once to avoid a wipe-out and subsequent hour long CR. I
would feel bad if I deliberately used the pathing repeatedly, knowing it
existed, and using it as part of my tactics. When I trained that golem
away, I was 100% sure I was going to die. When you jump back ad foreward
over the moat you kow there is zero chance of you dying, enabling you to
get risk free experience. That is the crux of the matter.

1: You knew you had no risk of dying

2: You repeatedly used the same bug to gain no-risk exp

If a GM saw you doing this, and you got a warning, you would have o
right to complain. Chances are GMs would have more important things to
do, but that doesn't change the fact that you were exploiting
