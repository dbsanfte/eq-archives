Eh, entirely dependant on gear regarding tanking. But ask a rgoue to
tank a Hard 65 LDoN and I'll chuckle (unless of course he's Time/GoD
geared but even then I think they would be a bit hard-pressed to
tank).

Rogue's DPS increases exponentially if they are fighting from behind
(backstabs, no misses from mob defensive skills). That means if they
are tanking, they won't be generating as much damage as they would not
tanking.
