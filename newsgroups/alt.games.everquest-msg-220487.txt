Ok, Im with ya on the leader board... that shiznits should never been
implimented....   BUT... you knew there was one..  You complain about
the linear of the dungeon...   The way dungeons were done before,
there was no dungeon crawl.  you sat and waited for respawn if you had
your Camp cleared.    There is a mission, you accept it, and you enter
the dungeon to accomplish that task... what side quests would you want
added to that to make it not linear?

This is a neat idea, but in the end the expansion was Lost DUNGEONS of
Norath.... not lost ship adventures, or lost plain hunting....  
They had the name and they ran with that theme.
Now, would of been great, Lost Adventures of Norath... would have left
their options wide open.  
With the new additions of LDoN for the abilities of the coders to make
new and grander instanced zones, we can hope that they will bring
these new abilities to bare in future additons.

I do agree that there are some various similarities within the same
dungeon type... but isnt that to be expected... The way I understood,
the dungeons were created by the same people... as in everfrost, all
the dungeons were created my miragul... doesnt it make sense that he
would have used similar building style in his dungeons?
