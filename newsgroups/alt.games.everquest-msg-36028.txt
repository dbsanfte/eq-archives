The reason there isn't official gambling in EQ is because Verant doesn't
want to get in trouble with various governments.  Since you can buy and
sell EQ plat for real money, they are worried that an EQ casino might be
seen as effectively being a RL casino.  They don't really want to be on
the cutting edge of setting internet gambling precedents.
