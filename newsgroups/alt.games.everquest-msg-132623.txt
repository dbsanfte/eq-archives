Beyond the obvious and already discussed trojan virus, look at this post

But dude, what you offer isn't an exploit, its a hack.  I mean putatively.
If it was a bug, it would have to be part of the program, not something
someone cooked up to get -around- the program.

Since its a hack, it couldnt' have been distributed by word of mouth,
someone would have to actually pass the hack around.  Well, I guess
they could let out word of how the hack works and other hackers could
emulate the original hack... but still, thats not what you said happened.

What would the race of this putative guild member have to do with anything?
Why not also tell us he's a cleric or necro or bard or something?  I mean if
you are including irrelevant information already, go whole hog.

How is it a "problem" if your guild has been using it for months?  Clearly you

lads -like- it.  Only now that (according to your story) other guilds have
started
doing the same thing, you want the gravy train stopped?

Even accepting all this, wouldn't the simplest way to deal with this be to go
directly to Sony or Verant, rather than this weird workaround?

END ORIGINAL POST

Web site claims to be "by dark_Elf" so that at least is close to
the original story... only it clearly states that its not a real
EQ name and isn't spelled the same way as in the post.

There is an actual EQ screen shot with no real information
betrayed, names are off, and we don't know that any of the
people in the shot are involved anyway.  And there doesn't
seem to be any connection between this putative waterfall
of cash and the screen shot.

Then there's the "screen shot of program" which doesn't show
the program working in EQ, just a mockup of a standard
windows button box.

Then the instructions:

                     THE PLATINUM MAKER instructions by dark_Elf
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
           its really very simple to use
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
0) Unzip the program.
1) Startup EQ (login, etc.)
2) Get all nice and fully connected to EQ server
3) Walk around EQ a little bit.
4) Run THE PLATINUM MAKER (double-click on icon)

What icon?  If the instructions had said "download
EQWindows" or something of that nature, perhaps you
would have access to an icon of some sort.  But as
it stands, normal EQ users are never going to be able
to hit that hypothetical icon.

5) Hit "ChaChing!" as many times as you want.

END OF WEB SITE NOTES

What I'm complaining about here is the lack of
craftsmanship and attention to detail in this con.
Its embarassing, really, to see such tripe passed
off as a legitimate scam.
