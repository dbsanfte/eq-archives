More then you want to know, all of which is IMHO and can be contested or
ignored.

I'd like to think I am the guy who coined the phrase "You can't win at a
role playing game" although many will probably dispute it.

There has been a distribution shift in the cultural make up of (R)ole
(P)laying (G)ames as they went into (C)omputerRPGs. Originally the
'demigods' of role playing could just do it convincingly. It didn't matter
if they role playing a level 2 cleric or a 14 wizard, quality of performance
was paramont. Combination of media<computers> and fan base meant there had
to be a endgame such that people could have closure. This took place around
1983 and broadened the appeal of RPGs.

With the advent of the massively multiplayer online games MMO, skill levels
became more important then end game. This was manifested in Diablo with
character levels being very important to social hierarchy. Diablo was also
the first real exposure to just how many people had a different idea of what
winning was. Huge amount of cheating and grief play kind of thing. Player vs
Player and Player vs Monster became divergent success paths as Quake Heads
moved into the genre.

As far as something a lot of us found funny and disturbing, follow this link

Level 5 bard, self proclaimed winner of the game. He may be right.

You are not alone. Actually, you are in pretty good company. I  have
heard/read at least one game designer that made almost the same statement
about how amazing he finds it that people are willing to spend 100s of hours
at a computer mouse clicking away repetitive tasks.

Like I said, ignore me if you will because I have a tendancy to come off the
wall. There is something in the human spirit that needs a frontier. There
are no frontier anymore. I mean you start off in Boston and "Go West young
man" and end up in East LA, big frigging whoop te do! No injuns<sic>, no
buffalo, no gold rush.

In another time, your friends would probably have been in the Donner Party.

It's just a new form of entertainment. I mean clerics probably complained
that books were taking away valuble time that should be spent praying.
Authors and clerics probably complained Radio was stopping people from
praying and reading. Same thing with movies, TV, video games in general.

Now that the universal human predisposition<these games are popular in
europe, Korea, Japan, etcetera too> to this type of entertainment has been
exposed, the real challenge is not to get another million monkies clicking
their mouse in front of a monitor. It should be to raise the level of the
experience to the point where you as one of its harshest critics considers
it time well spent.

It ain't going to happen right away. It may never happen. I haven't a clue
what it will take for it to happen universally. It does need to get better.
A little more like Total Recall would be nice. Go river rafting with your
family in VR or something.

Maybe go back 35ish years to taking that special girl to the Junior Prom in
an '67 Olds 442. Maybe that girl would like to be 16 again too. Of course
she would probably want to replace me with Jim Morrison, I think that could
work too. It doesn't have to be about mindless mouse clicking for dozens of
hours, it just is for now. It can eventually become the stuff that dreams
are made of.
