    Shammy friend hit 61 last night, I have two fights parsed in PoV where
his pet did 34 and 34 dps... tiny sample space but all we had time for.

    Quite possibly the 61 shammy pet isn't that much of an upgrade. Have
heard that hes an overcon from more than one source and did notice he
doesn't hit much harder, if any harder at all, just lands a few more blows.

    I would say to guess the high level shammy pet originally infringed on
necro and mage pet uberness and had his max damage nerfed. I did hear that
the quadding was semi nerfed, but wont discuss that here ;)

    I think you're wrong there, I recall my 58 SK pet (a level 37 skeleton)
conning ever so green to me, wheras the shammy pet was light blue.
