Wtf?  Mom?  It's a hypothetical situation, not an after school special.
Give me a break.  You're a joke.

Pathetically laughable.. an adverb modifying an adjective.  Way to go,
champ!

Seriously, though.. at least Lokari had some sort of argument.  You're just
a troll, you're not intelligent, and you're not in the least bit
entertaining since there's nothing to even think about when replying to you
aside from your inability to form a proper sentence.  So I'll just pull a
couple quotes from you and give you some logic, then I won't waste any
further time replying to your drivel.

"Grow up and wake up, kiddo, this ain't Sunday school."

"Because it's against the rule and potentially (untested) against the law."

There you go, fruity.  Grow up.  Adults break the rules sometimes.  Adults
break the law sometimes.  So follow your first quote up there and quit
acting like a little bitch.  No adults out there (or even kids) give half a
damn if you approve of their actions.  You keep on pretending like they do
with your super cool railgun.. chump.

k thx bye

(I threw in some of those "grown up" insults so maybe you'd get the point
this time.  You're a dumb bastard.  There, got it?  I hope so, since I won't
be trying to help you comprehend anymore.  Good luck.)
