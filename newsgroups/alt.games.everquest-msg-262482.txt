False!  Or at least, it should be false, but if too many players
take this attitude it could become true, which would be bad.

Fact: Plat is worth more than an equal amount of tribute.
Why?  Because if you have 100 plat you can always turn it
into 100 tribute if that's what you want, but you can also
use the plat for other things.  If you have 100 tribute,
you can't use it for anything but tribute buffs.

That's why I'm not surprised to see people making offers in
the bazaar, "Whirling Frammistat only 6.5k, worth 19k in
tribute!"  The seller would rather have 6.5k cash to spend
on something OTHER than tribute, than have 19k of tribute.
The buyer might well want a Whirling Frammistat and 6.5k
could be a fair price, but the seller is mentioning that if
nothing else you can buy it from him and triple the value
of your tribute -- but only IF you were planning to spend
that 6.5k on tribute.

Note that there are various items that yield a better than
1:1 ratio of tribute to plat.  E.g., I sometimes find Opal
Encrusted Steins on NPC vendors (presumably because someone
skilled up by making them and then dumped them); they cost
about 3pp.  I could turn them in for 24 tribute each, or I
could sell them in the bazaar for, say, 10-15pp.  Which
would I rather have?  The answer varies.  (Last time I found
a batch, I sold about half and "attributed" the rest.)

I'm told there's a Jewelcrafted item that yields tribute
about 4 times the cost of the components.  I'm not a jeweler
so I haven't looked into it.  And of course there's the fish
from Abysmal Sea, whose tribute values are 1000 times their
sales price (if you don't mind occasionally taking the time
to do some fishing).
