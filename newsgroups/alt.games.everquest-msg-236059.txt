Hi,

I'm from Manchester University where I'm currently undertaking a survey of
how people use their mobile phones for things like gaming, leisure
information and other new services. We're looking what attitudes people have
about their network providers, quality of service and how they feel about
mobile devices in general.

What we are after is people to complete the questionnaire but because we
don't believe in asking for something for nothing we are offering a prize of
a PALM TUNGSTEN T3* to one respondent.

The survey is available in English, Spanish, Greek and Italian at:

www.mobile-ent.org/survey

Thanks for your time. Good luck with the prize draw.

Jase
