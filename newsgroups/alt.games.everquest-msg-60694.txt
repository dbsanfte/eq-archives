(Top posting to prove a point)


No it adds more work. Because now someone has to scroll to
the bottom of this message to read the start of the conversation
and then scroll back up. Or read things out of order. It gets even
worse the longer a thread goes. If everyone bottoms posts its easy
to read and keep track.

English is read from top to bottom and left to right. Why is this such
a hard thing for people to understand?
