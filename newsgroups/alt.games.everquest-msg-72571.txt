  Proper grammar, spelling and sensible spacing makes it easier to
read a post.  Yes, you can comprehend a message if it uses bad
spelling, improper capitalization and punctuation and is posted in a
format that our newsreaders may not display correctly, but IT MAKES IT
MORE DIFFICULT to read..

  If you want people to respond helpfully and respectfully to your
posts, you should strive to make them as easily understandable and
readable as possible.  Also, using bad spelling and poor grammar just
has a way of making people sound uneducated, stupid or lazy.

  I don't flame people unless they initiate it (and even then I do so
very seldom) but I also am not usually inclined to make the effort to
read posts when the poster is seems to put no effort in the
presentation of their message.  For example, I only skimmed the
content of this message I am responding to, because I simply found
reading it to be unpleasant.  Maybe I'm a "snob" (though if so, I'm a
lesser snob than many, or perhaps even most newsgroup regulars), but
that's just the way I feel.

  That's my prespective.  Take it into consideration or discard it as
you see fit.
