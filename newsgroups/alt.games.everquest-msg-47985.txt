If you have no damage bonus, then it would seem that having the best
damage/delay ratio weapon in your primary hand would be desirable, assuming
you are not worried about skill increases.  That would give you the most
damage overall.  You will still hit the same percentage of the time, and
given the better damage/delay ratio, will hit for more damage over time than
with a faster, lower ratio weapon.  The reasons you would want a low delay
weapon in your primary had are, damage bonuses, skill increases, and higher
aggro.
