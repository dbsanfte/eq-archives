I can relate.  And it doesn't help that I don't play that much so even
if I could manage to stick to one character, I probably would still be
outleveled by my in-game "friends"! (which is what has happened to me
before, which is why I stopped playing at least one character).  

I tried playing a bard to level 4 but know I will never play one again
because of all the song-twisting and resultant RSI (my hat's off to
those of you who have high-level bards that you play well).  

Haven't had much experience playing berserker, druid, enchanter, mage,
paladin, rogue, SK or wizard to comment on them.  

I kind of like playing warrior and cleric but don't like how they are
more group-dependent than other classes, which doesn't fit with my
play time (where usually I can only play for about an hour at a time).

I also enjoy shaman, but I think the classes I have enjoyed the most
are BL, necro, monk and ranger.  When I have been playing recently,
it's been my ranger; I really like having ranger tracking and I miss
it a lot when I play any non-ranger characters, although sometimes I
miss not having FD or having a pet to sacrifice while I run to the
zone if I get jumped by something! :-P  (Of course, my ranger is now
almost level 30 so having SOW should hopefully make that not so much
of an issue!)
