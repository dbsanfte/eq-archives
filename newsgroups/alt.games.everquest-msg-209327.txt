Sorry for the dumb question, but I've read various message boards, and
there's one for the Lanys server called the Shit List, where people
post to warn other players on that server about jerks/idiots who are
scammers, KSers,  intentionally train people constantly, etc.  Some of
the posts talk about how a shit-listed player will have scammed
somebody, then went and deleveled themselves to a certain level (46
seems to be the magic number) and then sold off all their droppable
gear.  What's the point of that anyway?  And why do people
deliberately delevel themselves anyway?

I mean I can see if the shitlisted player just quit playing that
particular character and transferred their droppable gear to a new
character, since if the player really is that big of a jerk, his or
her name will likely be mud and no one will want to group with them or
have them be in their guild, but what's the deal with the deleveling?
If they're already on the list as "level 55 warrior Scumbag1", what's
the difference if they delevel themselves?  They'll still have the
same character name. 

Thanks in advance,
