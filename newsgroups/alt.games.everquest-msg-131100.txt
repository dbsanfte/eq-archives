I tend to agree, DSL is a better gaming connection. Definitely if you only 
have cable you'll in no way be disappointed with your gaming and, at least 
where I live, cable is much faster for downloading than DSL (unless you're 
close and can pay lots).

I wish I had looked at the different EQ servers before I ever began 
playing just to see whether I could ping better on one than another. I 
don't know if they're in different geographic locations or on different 
networks, however, so maybe the speeds don't vary much. I play in 
Cazic-Thule now and during light times late at night my ping (the one on 
the right) will hang around 200-500, sometimes less sometimes more. I 
noticed at heavy times during mid-day it can be up around 1000-1800. Very 
annoying, yet still playable because there's no loss. Try playing 
Half-Life with an 1800 ping :P
