If you want to get from 26 to 30 faster, perhaps consider going to Antonica
and checking out High Hold Keep. The Guard Room and Lookout room would all
still have dark blue and even cons to you. While enchanters really aren't
*needed* since the spawn rate is rather slow, if you are on at odd times, a
group with you in it could camp a lot more than usual. Truly, the exp at HHK
is a beautiful thing.

P.S. Also, could try soloing Osargen in the dungeon if they are no groups
looking for more.
