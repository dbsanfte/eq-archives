Well some of them leave.  Others are "not there for the loot" and
get what loot they do own by work outside the raid environment.
Prior to the highest end, most loot is attainable by pharming junk,
selling it, and buying what you need, or by single group work, where
(funny how this works out) the loot is usually distributed randomly
with no reward to the guy thats done it a hundred times before.

Personally most of my "high end" loot came from attending raids
with guilds I wasn't a member of but which used a random loot
system.  They needed a cleric, I came, when time came to split up
the nice cleric drop, I was given the same shot at it as their own
guild cleric who had been on a hundred raids before.  Sometimes
I won, sometimes I lost.  Seemed fair to me, but from following
this thread I'm sure there are people who violently disagree.  I
eventually moved to one of the "random loot" guilds, where I am
now (so they are reaping the benefits of my having "their" loot) but
they've changed over to a points system.  Might be one where the
loot still distributes relatively fairly, haven't been under the thumb
of the system long enough to find out.  On the other hand, I can't
see how an invite -now- can hope to see any loot, and he wouldn't
even be "making his guild more powerful by helping the higher point
guys get loot" which is one of the frequent claims of a points system.
