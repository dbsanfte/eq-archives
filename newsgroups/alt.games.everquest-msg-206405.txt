If your druid worships Tunare, you can clear 1k+ imbuing emeralds and 
selling them in the bazaar for 25pp each.  There is plenty of demand on 
my server with all the tradeskillers.  Just be sure to get 2 CHA mugs 
before purchasing the emeralds and seek out a KEI before imbuing.

If you want a little more for your effort, head up to CS and fish the 
Cobalt Cod and sell for 30 to 60pp each in the bazaar.  The cod can net 
you an extra 500pp to 1k per hour depending on the market and your 
fishing skills.  Forage the tufts of wolf fur and sell those for 20 to 
40pp in the bazaar.  I'm not sure of the forrage rate on those, but that 
will add a little more plat for your effort.  Time to sell and your 
server's market may be different.
