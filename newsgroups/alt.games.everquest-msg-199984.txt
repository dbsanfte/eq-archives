As far as it is known on AB server, it is basically a timed spawn with a 3
day interval. Some guild had a lock on him and timed within the 10 minutes
of when the first chant would go off to signal DS was "up".

When doomshade is "up" the DM's will chant every so often; no clue about the
interval probably somewhere between 30min to an hour or so. They will keep
doing this while Doomshade is "up". This can go on for days if nobody takes
him, but he's pretty easy for some fast loot and normally won't last a night
:).
Now to actually make him "visible" (think: spawn) you'll have to kill the
DM's fast after each other. A timer runs from the moment you kill the first
one. We usually pull them in 2's and the 4th one goes down in under 10 min
from fist engage (good thing about pulling 2's is that when the first one
goes down you also have the 2nd already down to 80% or so and is already in
camp). I heard 15 min was the timer, but I really have no idea, just go as
fast as your guild can handle, burn all mana, use all discs which repop
before you pull DS etc.
DS will spawn after the last DM within a minute. If he doesn't pop on track
within a minute you were either too slow or DS wasn't "up".

We usually wait at this moment till all clerics are back up to full mana and
then pull DS ~ normally about 10 min after he popped.
