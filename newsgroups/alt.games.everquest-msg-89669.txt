Yeah, unless you're doing 8 generals in a row
and it gets old sneaking down there when the undead
starts popping (who often have a GREAT chance to
see through skulking of a level <5 character).

It's funny how the Dark Elves (all level 55+) can't
see him, but some decaying soldier (level 30ish)
will bash him in a heartbeat.

Anyway, it's just simpler to let the turn-in person eat
the HT...it's not like dying one time and getting
a click-stick rez is going to seriously hurt your
exp totals...
