Yes, but

1) Language : You wont be able to talk to each other till you learn
human. This will take a lot of effort.
2) Alignment : Your Monk will worship Cazic Thule (SP) and so must be
some sort of Evil alignment. If your friends chars are good then you
can't group. If they are Neutral then you are ok, but don't get bonuses,
if they are evil they you are fine.
3) Travel : You will need to get together somewhere, this could be
tricky with the binding restrictions as you are not going to be liked
much in a lot of towns.

I think that it will be tricky at best to have your iskar monk group
with them.

HTH,

Jim
