Oh, to steal the words from an old song, "Wouldn't it be lovely?"

We've had that discussion so many times, both on xp groups and raids.
Wouldn't it be great if a wizard could TL or port you to his/her own
bind point.  Awfully convenient and more uses than you could imagine.

Unfortunately, it's also open to a vast range of potential "abuses"
where raids could shortcut content. (Yes, yes, yes, mages with CoTH and
necros with the double rez/summon trick do it all the time. Don't tell
me, tell VI.)  Then again, VI has disabled CoTH in many zones where they
don't want that happening, so only they can draw the line on *which*
content they really care if you shortcut.

But for an example.... any guild could find a relatively safe spot in
some tough zones where a wizard could bind himself. Then, he'd never
really have to change his bind point, because whether he dies, gates, or
what have you, he can just quickly mem a different self port and get out
of there.

But come raid time, he could send the entire raid to that spot. 
Examples might be several islands up in Air, the SW "safe spot" in Hate,
the pool room by the ranger epic mob in the Hole (or even the third
floor of the undead tower), by the wall near the water down in Chardock
by the herbalist area (or a couple spots near Royals, for that matter),
even a couple spots in Howling Stones in the East wing, though not sure
on those.

No... just too many places would be completely trivialized by this
ability for me to see VI approving that.
