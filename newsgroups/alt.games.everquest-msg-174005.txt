And in further defense of Wal-Mart (OT though), while I despise their
corporate management due to their treatment of workers in the
corporate office (grew up in Wal-Mart City in NW Arkansas), I admire
Wal-Mart for fighting against every frivolous lawsuit that is filed
against the company.  I haven't heard of the company settling before
(but I don't want to hear "well they did once", save your keystrokes)
on a frivolous lawsuit, and that's a breath of fresh air.
