    Apparently the "fix" put in for this was to have anyone logged out in
Grobb or Innothule pop up at the safe spot in Nek forest when servers came
back up. Confusing as hell for new players, annoying for old players.

    Perhaps we could have The Bazaar and Shadow Haven invaded next by the
Shissar, and have people log on after next patch to giant snakes eating
their level 1 Bazaar mules. "I think it's a good thing for level 1 mules
with 300 pounds of gear to have to extracate themselves from their newbie
bind points. Besides, it'll be interesting to see which newbie bind point
the troll mules go to!"

    As per above, they avoided the issue. But that answer was pretty flip
considering who the average person logged off in Grobb would have been.

    "Useless" is one thing. But to make the one area a person can rely on to
like them be unsafe without them screwing up the faction?

    You're right. I have no idea what the newbie quests are any more, since
they DIDN'T EVEN MOVE THE GUILD TRAINERS! "I have a note, but I can't find
this person. Where are they?" Effing brilliant job there. Does anyone know
if the cultural forge was moved?

    Way, waaaay-back when I started, my troll shadow knight did all the
traditional spots - Innothule and Upper Guk, then South Ro, then Oasis. I'd
get partial resists on cold nukes from frog and orc shamans, and would
resist the odd poison effect (I had the shield and mail from the Heart
Spiders, lucky me!) When I went to Oasis, I found the chain-nuking Madmen -
and I couldn't resist a single fire nuke. They'd shred me in seconds, even
faster than they'd kill other folks. I might not have been fighting Nagafen,
but I remember what a difference having a "5" versus a "25" made.

     It will if you have to be the one slogging through all the players.
Every other race gets a unique newbie area, even if they share newbie zones
like the Wood and High elves do. These are the only races that have to share
a single newbie area, and they have to do it because the programmers were
too lazy to create a new city and newbie zone.

    Even I could have done this better - have a swampy frog city, with a
"back gate" way to the northwest corner of Innothule (guards only inside the
city).  Change the northwest spawns in Innothule from poison snakes to
something a bit more new-playerish, like kobolds, rats, and skeletons, and
adjust any troll quests to compensate. The main gate goes to the new
newbie-low teens zone, which transitions from swamp, through grasslands, to
desert. The zone out of that connects to the never-finished zone tunnel
beside the orc highway in Oasis.

    Reason for the city? Pressure from undead frogs in Lower Guk forced an
expanding population to build a new home in the swamp, one better suited to
trading with peoples like the humans to the north. You have your RP reasons
down, nobody gets displaced or annoyed, you've used some existing areas that
weren't used well before, everyone is happy. Was two zones so much to ask
for (and addition of a zone tunnel to Innothule)?

    Yeah, I know. I should have seen they'd screw up somehow. I just didn't
think they'd do it to this degree.
