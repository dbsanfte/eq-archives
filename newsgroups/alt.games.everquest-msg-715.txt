The ONLY time you would see a decrease is in a situation where you are an
Troll Shadownight (max race and class penalty) grouped with a halfling
warrior (max race and class bonus).  Before, you would steal a great deal of
the xp from the halfling b/c of the vast difference in xp required to level,
but now the xp from a kill is split by your level, so you end up getting a
little less (maybe), and the halfling gets MUCH more then they used to.

Ex:
Pre patch
T SN, requires 1000 * 1.4(race) * 1.4(class) = 1960 required
H Wr, requires 1000 * 0.95(race) * 0.9(class) = 855 required

For a 100xp mob,
T SN gets 100 * (1960/(1960+855) ) = 70xp
H Wr gets 100 * (855/(1960+855) ) = 30xp

Post Patch

T SN, still requires 1960
H Wr, still requires 855

For a 100xp mob,
T SN gets 100 * (0.5) * 1.4 = 70xp
H Wr gets 100 * (0.5) = 50xp

So, the Troll Shadownight gets the same (just by chance the numbers worked
that way), and the halfling gets 167% of what they used to.
