I really thought I would need my melee skills up for when I got into higher
levels, so my druid worked on her skills up until about 40 when I learned to
quad kite.  Now when I solo or even group I never ever melee, If I have time
to melee.. I should be sitting down medding.. you never know when you may
need that 70mana to heal for the cleric that went LD or evac the group out..
and if you were melee'ing the whole time, you may just get thrown out of the
group.  It is fun to charm kite mobs and pick at them with my scimitar
sometimes=)
