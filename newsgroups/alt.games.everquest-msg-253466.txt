I'm a 4-banger fan.  In automotive matters, I tend to defer to my Dad's 
wisdom.  When I asked him about engines as a wee gnomeling, he was quick 
to point out that for most practical purposes, the main difference between 
a 4-cylinder and an 8-cylinder engine was that the 8-cylinder had twice as 
many parts to break.  Twice as many rods to throw, twice as many rings to 
replace, twice as many valves to adjust.  Bleh.  And as for the V, it sure 
makes an engine look cooler, but it also makes the engine take up much 
more of the engine compartment, so it's harder to reach whatever part you 
need to work on.

As for the transmission issue, as another poster pointed out, a manual is 
not (by default) more fuel efficient.  It makes fuel efficiency dependent 
on how well you drive it.  Auto trannies are also vastly more complicated 
beasts than manual, and hence more prone (all else being equal) to 
breakage.  But, again, I defer to my Father's sage advice.  The real, 
significant, difference between auto tranny and manual is that with AT, 
it's much easier to hold your girlfriend's hand while you drive. :)

But America is America, and someone noticed that people get all excited 
when you say you have a V8, even if it's not vegetable juice.  So 
naturally, I'm sure the advertising folks have put some pressure on to 
capitalize on that, and as a result, everyone believes V8s are mo'better 
unless they've actually thought about it, and now you probably can't sell 
enough of other types to make it worthwhile.

Our poor oil reserves, though.  We really need an electric V8.  Maybe if I 
put some vodka in it. :)

I do wish I could buff and SoW my car, though.  A Toyota with Virtue might 
hold up better if I crash into something.  Of course, the SoW would just 
get me more speeding tickets. :)
