As a Combine player, I have very little interest in this expansion; its 
at a minimum several months away but in reality more likely over a year 
away if EVER; beating the expansions has slowed to a crawl on Combine, 
and we have POR TBS TSS and... something else?  to go thru before 
getting to SOF

That said, I really wish there was more classic fantasy style in EQ, and 
less of these expansions filled with aliens and alien landscapes; if I 
wanted aliens I'd be playing AO or something.  Where are the elves 
gnomes dwarves trolls etc?

I could forgive this in Luclin, where the moon setting lent itself to a 
little alien action... but IMO that was where EQ lost its sense of style 
and has never really recaptured it, expansion after expansion stuffed 
full of aliens aliens aliens.

SOF would be an opportunity to explore more deeply gnomes, elves and 
dwarves, the races of Faydwer... and by coincedence, classic fantasy 
races of the sort I miss.

Having not actually gone there, I have no idea what they really did...

Levels wise, though, I hear this expansion marks a change from two a 
year to one a year.  As such I'd think they'd have stuffed two 
expansions worth into it, meaning things from 1 to 80, not just 75 to 
80... that sounds like an ordinary expansion to me!
