I soloed Dire Sonic Wolves in Tenebrous through most of my mid-upper
40's. Fairly unpopulated and easy hunting. The little alien dudes are
good hunting, too. Only problem is faction with Katta guards as a
troll. :-/ But, if you beat up Hands of Seru for a bit, you could be
good there. ;-) Bloodgills in LOIO will probably be good, too. I went
through 48 on them, and they were just starting to go light blue here
and there.
