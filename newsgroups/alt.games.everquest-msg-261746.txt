Divine Aura, HoTs and fast heals, in theory they're a plate class 
(although EQ doesn't seem to care), stuns, roots, not to mention 
defensive disciplines on melees (more of which should exist)... sure... 
let them try, a cleric that -knew- he was going to be the center of 
attention probably would survive for quite a while. :)

If mobs went for the cleric, and the game was actually tuned remotely 
for that sort of thing, the cleric would probably do just fine.
