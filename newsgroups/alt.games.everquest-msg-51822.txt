Well probably because this is a new problem. If you recall the other Error
message said *Error Access is denied*. This one says *Error 1017*! They are
not the same and that is why I posted this. I figured most people could just
read the subject title and be able to tell the difference, guess not. Well,
again, anyone who can help please reply if not please don't!
