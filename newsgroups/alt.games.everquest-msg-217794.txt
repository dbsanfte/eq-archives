Hello Ben,

I don't know about the time issue with your server.  LDON on
Stormhammer goes fairly quick!  0 - 30 min to get a group and
typically my group makes 2-3 adventures in a row.  I understand that
there are some people who come up from the lower servers with horror
stories concerning not only the hassle to get a group, but after
getting a group they have to WAIT their turn to enter the dungeon
[sic]!  Not sure if this is true, but I hope to never see it!

I disagree about it being the WORST expansion!  I love it and have
armor and weapons with augmentations that rival the best drops from 70
- 75 bosses!  And I did it with a few close friends and in a matter of
a few days of playing!

I suggest you log onto one of the websites that list EQ items and
compair the stats and the difficulties to attain.  If you are
intelligent and open minded you will see that the LDON stuff as it
stands is by far the easiest most useful gear in the game at the
moment.  See my in depth posting about LDON gear following this
posting.

Ted
