True, Bebinn, but that's not what I mean - I know about (and use)
/ttell, but it doesn't go far enough...  

To clarify, I want to be able to send a tell to someone hitherto
untargetted and/or unspoken to (yes, I know how to scroll through
previous tells) and/or not in my visual range by clicking their name
in the chat window.  It would cut down a lot of the shouting!

For example someone called Melderriana shouts for info - I can help
out, but typing a name like that (while doing several things at the
same time!) can be a nuisance.  You mistake the 'rri' for a letter 'm'
or something, or miss out an 'r' while trying to type really fast, or
stick an extra 'l' in  :D  

Meantime, the name you are trying to keep one eye on scrolls off the
top of the chat window - then, (oh blast it) you have the message
"xxxxxxxxx is not online" and you have to scroll up, find the damn
name again etc.....  You all know what I mean, I'm sure!

I just want to be able to click the name with the mouse, and have the
TELL command pop up, with name filled in, and sitting waiting for me
to type a message in  :D   They then use /r to reply to me, I
henceforth do likewise, and onwards we go.  Bliss........
