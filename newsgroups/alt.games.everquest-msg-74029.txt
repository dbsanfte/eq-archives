Here we disagree.  I find nothing wrong with someone who choses a fantasy
character's name.  I find nothing wrong with someone whom you choose to
label as having a "lack of imagination" because they choose a name or
variant there of or a mispelling of it.

To me violations such as Mouse, Sparrowhawk nor Vulture should be on the
list.

Names from history such as Rollon, Dudo nor Athena should be on the list.

Names from mythology and ancient religion such as Cuchulainn, Durvasa nor
Anansi should be on the list.

What are considered "proper names" such as Mark, Eric nor Cathrine should be
on the list.

Choosing a name lilke OerkJff or FotherMucker or Fartjuice are the names
that I find offensive in the game and I (as many) have seen folks choose
offensive names of this nature because they thought it would be neat to beat
the filter system.

You want to be anal retentive about naming conventions then first clean out
the jerks who find ways to just BE offensive and let those you deem of
"lower intellect" or "less imaginative" than yourself play the game with
names you may recognize from books or movies.

Personally I have seen a lot of chars with names from various mythologies,
books and historic figures from around the world playing.  I don't find them
offensive in the least (many probably don't even know that the name they
have chosen HAS any history -- take som character names and run them through
a web search -- see what turns up).

Ciao for now
