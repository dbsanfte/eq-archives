    Can someone check if Permafrost was one of the "30 and under" dungeons?
I have a sneaking suspicion it was, which means the Pits just got a whole
lot more attractive for XP grinding. And based on the XP we saw in Cazic
Thule (three quarters of a blue for a solo kill of a blue), I have to wonder
if Cazic isn't also flagged that way. I'll have to run my enchanter down to
Upper Guk to camp the AC to see if the increase there has made it worthwhile
as a pure XP camp. :-)
