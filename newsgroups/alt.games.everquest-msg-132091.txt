I'd be willing to support that opinion were it not for these two little
details:
1) all those lovely parents out there who can't be bothered with the
responsibilty of actually raising their own children (and they are
legion), and
2) who decides what should and should not be taught in a public venue?

For instance, I believe that it is extremely important that the
entire populace be educated reasonably accurately on a world-wide
epidemic that kills an enormous number of people every year.  This
is a matter of public safety, period.
