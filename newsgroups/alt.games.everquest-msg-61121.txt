Get the Windowblinds 3.x (I think) that now has the Made for XP et al. logo.
Nothing really different than the wb's you were used to using - if infact
you ever did - under Win9x except that it's actually stable and doesn't suck

some cases you get pushpin/help functionality not readily available from the
normal title bar.
