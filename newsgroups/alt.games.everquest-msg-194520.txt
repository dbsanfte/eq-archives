OK, then answer me this please...I've been using OE for years (because I'm
lazy, but have downloaded X-news.  Maybe I'll get around to installing it)
and have *never* seen a post by this "End times prophet" that everyone
complains about.  However I do see cross-posted articles and he's not in
Kill-file.
Not that I really give a damn what he has to say (judging by what others
have remarked about him), but now that I see someone having a like issue and
*not* using OE, I'm a bit curious.

What do you think?

Sean...
