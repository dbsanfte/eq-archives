ROFL.
Tanks are _not_ DPS classes.
Paladin as the lowest DPS of any melee.  Their DPS is so low that even
vs. Undead they cannot do now more than match Warriors despite SU3 and
their buff proc.
Warriors lag far behind the DPS classes.
SKs have passed Warriors in DPS as a result of the manaflow explosion.
I'm not sure that you could match an EQ/AM3 Ranger for DPS with one of
each.
