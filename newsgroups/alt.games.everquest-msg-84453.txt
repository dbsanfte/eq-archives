Necromancers have 2 corpse summoning spells:

Level 39, Summon Corpse - uses non-stackable coffins, costs about 175pp.
Level 57, Conjure Corpse - uses stackable coffins, about 70pp

The only places where you can buy these coffins, as far as I know, are in
Neriak- Cleric Guild, somewhere in Luclin (Shadowhaven?) and in Plane Of
Air. The one that you saw in AK'Anon was probably sold there by a player.
The coffin is consumed during the process.

Regarding the Kaladim factio issues .. I dont much.
