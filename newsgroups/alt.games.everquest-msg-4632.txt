Yeah, but they took this PvP system largely from a non-graphical
multiplayer online role playing game, so we are not dealing with yet
another "Hey...I think this will work...let's try it" PvP system.  We
are dealing with one that was used in a production game.  That gives me
some hope that they are right and that it will work.
