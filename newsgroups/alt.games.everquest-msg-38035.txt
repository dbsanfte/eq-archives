Lots of the local grocery stores try and discourage 
actively shopping for the best price (ie checking the 
cost and writing it down - yeah I live on a budget :) ) 
by claiming that it 'might be a competitor spying on our 
prices'.  Uh-huh.  Last time somebody told me that I 
told them I'd stop writing down prices when they stopped 
publishing flyers full mostly of stuff I'd never buy and 
shoving them in my mailbox (and the mailbox of every 
competitor's employee) every single flipping week.
