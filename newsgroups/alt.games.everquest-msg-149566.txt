Well, to clarify, this isn't to say that I never assist mobs.
Particularly when pulling, I have a non-specific /assist key set up and
use it on mobs before I tag them. If it pops up a player name, then I
know it's engaged, even if I can't see the player, and I'll move on. If
it pops up *MY* name, then I've got lazy aggro running wild out in my
pulling area and I need to evac once or camp out and back in.

Just never thought of using it to check taunt. Nice idea. I've passed it
along to our guild boards. Shockingly, not only had Ben not thought of
it, nor I, but none of the MA tanks my guild had either.
