Lammy is a great primary hand weapon, but not so good offhand
Wurmslayer would be a great secondary hand weapon but plain awful at
your level in primary hand

Wurm is primary hand only I believe which means not only is it bad in
itself, it also means your lammy isn't fully effective.

Put Lammy in primary hand - it's a VERY decent primary hander at your
level
Sell/Drop/Destroy Wurmslayer
Buy a decent offhander, based purely on dam/dly ratio
