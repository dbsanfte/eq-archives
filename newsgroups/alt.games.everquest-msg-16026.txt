Others have answered the question, lemme answer the underlining issue with
my opinion.

Don't use your practice points unless you NEED them.  Just save them
up...they don't rot or anything.  I know that with my rogue and monk saving
them are damned near impossible, but all my other characters (I have about a
dozen at the moment) are saving up for when they find 30 levels down the
road that their <whatever> skill really sucks, or they decide to take up a
trade skill or three. :)

(it's a shame you can't sell 'em to other players....)
