Were?

Wasn't there a time when JBoots and Selos made you immune to root?

- The Short Sword of Ykesha was uber
- Haste items stacked (FBSS and Mith 2hder, anyone?)
- Cros Treewind was alive
- WK was the largest zone in the game.
- Monks carried large sewing kits and not back packs
- Druids had nothing to whine about ;ï¿½)
- People would roll on Split Paw Hide gloves
- The Axe of the Iron Back looked like a sword
