YAY!! I can't BEGIN to tell you how happy I am someone corrected me.   WHEW.
DAMN, I thought I was going to have a bitch of a time getting the Prince
dead.  All for an epic weapon that's pretty ugly that doesn't do a whole lot
for ME.\

Thanks!

Ah, I think everyone but pure melees and clerics are probably in the same
boat.  I guess enchanters are pretty lucky...only 7 of the 27 (or so) steps
need NO enchanter help except buffs.   Druids aren't really needed for
Faydedar or Ulump but at least they can toss heals and then die. :)
