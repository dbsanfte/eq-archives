With being a samurai? Nothing. I wasn't commenting on that.

With being a ninja? It's not intended to be *exactly* a ninja, just
ninja-ish assassin class, built with existing EQ "parts." Ninja were
adept at disguising themselves. You could make a whole new "Disguise"
skill, but it's easier just to use the Illusion spells. Likewise,
ninja are supposed to be able to take on various different roles not
just visually but also in their mannerisms and language. You could
make something new for that, but benevolence spells accomplish more or
less the same thing. Depending on which folktales you listen to, ninja
have special motions they can make with their hands which can
distract, blind, or stun their enemies. Hence, those spells.

I'm presuming that any new class being introduced would have to be
suitably-generic that more than one race/culture could play it, anyway
-- not a ninja but something close enough that you can call it a ninja
if you want to. Otherwise, it would be as if the beastlord class was
introduced with only Vah Shir being able to qualify for it. People
wouldn't be happy when told "if you want to be this class, you have to
be <whatever the EQ Japanese race is>." And something just doesn't
sound right to me, calling a character from some other race a "ninja."
