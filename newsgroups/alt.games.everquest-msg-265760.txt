This is only true for some subclasses - "The neutral subclasses which
will be trained in both cities are: guardian, berserker, warden, fury,
wizard, warlock, troubadour, and dirge."  Unless they've changed this?
I haven't heard anything about it, but I haven't really looked either.

So you can play an evil wizard, but not an evil paladin, monk, mystic,
templar, swashbuckler, ranger, conjurer or illusionist.  And you can't
be a good bruiser, shadowknight, defiler, inquisitor, brigand,
assassin, necromancer or coercer.

It's not clear to me why illusionists and conjurers are good only, and
the warlock description sounds pretty evil to me (poison and disease
has those connotations), but apart from those the alignment
restrictions make sense to me.
