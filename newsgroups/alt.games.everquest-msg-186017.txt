Druid/Wizard porting didn't diminish the game, and it became one of
the largest and most profitable "industries" in EQ prior to the newer
port systems. A clear indication that players quickly grow tired of
tedious travel, especially when play time is limited.

The world (of EQ) is just as incredibly large and exotic as it was
prior to the PoK portal system. (larger actually if you count the new
zones added with PoP and LoY). Faster travel can make any world "feel"
smaller (just like the real world), but it doesn't actually make the
world physically smaller. 

It is really just a matter of perception.

I agree 100% with one of the other posts in this thread. The PoK books
should have been on a "flag" system, and only usable once you had
travelled to them on foot. Just like the Velious "keyed" system
without the keys.
