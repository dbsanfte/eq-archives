Hmmm...  Then you must live in another dimension than the rest of us.  Even
with all the testing in the world, ever notice that you can't find a game
out there without some sort of conflict with something out there?  Ever try
converting one system that was running into a new system?  Network Rollouts
seem to entitle hardware, and minor software changes, but using the same
underlying protocols and changes in routing paths.  Software rollouts
depend on a lot of factors, some of which, you can't exactly test out to
your heart's content, no matter how much time you have and expect it to
work on a very dynamic situation.

You don't have to be an Entry level programmer to make mistakes, you can be
a top level coder and still make mistakes because changes introduced, even
in your own code, can backfire.  But again, you are a networking person,
who deals heavily in hardware than software, and what software you do deal
with, still falls under a standard.
