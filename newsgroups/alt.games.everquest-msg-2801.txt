    Jo,

    Unrest just is horrible for stuff like this.  I will only do this with
SoW.  When they start to aggro, hit my "Train" shout social and run like
h*ll.

    Your experience is in general the same if you try to mez them one at a
time.  They say "Holy cow an enchanter, lets get him first".

    Got to let the tanks engage first for sure and I have not found a good
cure for the times (not all of them) when the entire pull aggros on me.

    Cames
    23rd Enchanter
    Vazzelle
