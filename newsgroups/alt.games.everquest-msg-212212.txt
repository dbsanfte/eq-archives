A while ago there was a post from someone wanting to know
about making a few plat from 'imbuing' gems.

I need some imbued jade badly.  Not so badly as to skill up a
Rallos Zek Org Shaman to level 29 to imbue them myself mind all,
just a few badly points below that I would be willing to give
a stack or two of the gems, and the mass imbue spell (83-105pp)
to someone willing to do the deed.

Anyone on Luclin want the spell for an hour's work?

Aoebe

(yes, thankfully, my skilling up on armor is getting somewhere, but
this is for a barbarian friend of mine)
