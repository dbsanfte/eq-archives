I did, for a while. Up by LOIO, pulling from the top of the hill leading
towards the zone. Pretty good exp for level 30 or so, adds aren't too
bad,(*)
and zone is pretty handy. But grouping in FM was much better loot and
somewhat better exp. I wouldn't want to try it as a melee though - I had
the option of gating if rooted.

        ...Ronny

(*) Aren't too bad if done there. Done elsewhere... yick.
