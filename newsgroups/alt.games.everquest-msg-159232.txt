But not the first to hit 65, that was a Rogue on Stormhammer who was
65 before most people had the expansion installed.  He was *certainly*
65 before my UPS despatched copy of PoP was delivered.  Heh.

I'm also reliably informed he had 100 *unspent* AA that he had no real
clue what to do with before the you-can-only-carry-forward-30 rule was
announced.
