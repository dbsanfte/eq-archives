Hrmmm

That contradicts the official faq which says

4. I already know that when I move a character to a Legends server I get to
keep all my stuff, titles, faction. everything.  But what if I cancel and go
back to my old server?  Will the unique items that I've discovered on the
Legends server go with me?

A.  Absolutely.  Anything you earn on a Legends server you get to keep.
