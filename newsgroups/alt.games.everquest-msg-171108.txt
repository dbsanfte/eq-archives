I also want to be able to mix it up.  3 wizards kick ass too but how
much fun is it really?

I considered shaman for the sow and regen capabilities plus buff and
de-buff.  Really a great all around class.  Wizard was for travel as
well as high impact nukes.  Paladin for tank but also capable of heals
so shaman wasn't just a healer.

I'm not necessarily looking for the most effeicient, nor the most
death-proof, just a combo that is powerful and fun.  Fun being the
primary attribute....
