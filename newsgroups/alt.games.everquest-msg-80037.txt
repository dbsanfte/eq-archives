I did some inital digging, Brewers Phrase and Fable online atually had
part of it..it is Scottish, they are a faerie type (and a bad faerie so
they live underground), Brewers actually lists the race as being
collectively called  Drows (which I dimly rememebr as drow being a derived
expression), and its an alternative to the more common Trows. The race
gets a mention in Scott's poem Pirates. Undergroud nasty faerie race (ie
elf) known for aestheic ability and metal handling in the original legend.
Like I say its an obscure variant, and half the pages I used to go looking
at for mythological stuff like this seem to have been
disconnected...including the encyclopedia mytholgica page.....
