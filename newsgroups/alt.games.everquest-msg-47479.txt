They do, it's just very uncommon. On this topic, my twink du jour
in Butcherblock has picked up quite a few spider silks from the
large spiders in the crossroads area. Could be nothing more than
a lucky random number run, but the last time I hunted there, those
critters weren't giving up much silk. These spiders are only 
level 2-4, by the way. I don't know of any other spider silk 
droppers which are that low.
