We got to wondering what else he would drop. (Come on! You KNOW the
bastard doesn't have a loot table. Nobody was <ever> expected to kill
him.)

Me: "Drops the Rusty Mace of Kerafyrm"
Her: "Really? What's the difference in stats between that and the rusty
mace you get off orcs in South Ro?"
Me: "Stats? No difference in stats. But is says 'of Kerafyrm' dOOd! Plus
it has a PROC!"
Her: "Proc? What's the proc?"
Me: "True North. Always be sure to be standing to the South of the mob
while engaged."
