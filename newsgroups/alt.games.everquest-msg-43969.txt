I am very glad they decided to not implement this code. For me it was a deal
breaker and would have cuased me to cancel all 5 of my accounts.

I understand why it was attempted but to make it part of a major expansion
for all levels is harsh. Something not very conducive to allowing your main
characters to go and explore the new areas and enjoy them to the fullest.
