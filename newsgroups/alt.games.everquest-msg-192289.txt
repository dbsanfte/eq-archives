Trying to research the level 34 Wizzie spell Circle of Force.  I've maxed out
my skill points in Research and failed four times in a row.  When I finally
successfully made the spell it told me it was trivial.  How the hell can I fail
four out of five times if it's trivial?  Was I just extremely unlucky or is
this the way it usually is?  I'm not a trade skill person so this is all new to
me.  Thanks.
