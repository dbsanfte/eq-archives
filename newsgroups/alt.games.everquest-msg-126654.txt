No, reversing it doesn't get you a wind god.  The kamikazi, the divine
wind, was the windstorm that came up and sank the Mongol fleet as it
crossed the sea from China towards Japan.  They called themselves
kamikazi to build the idea that they were the "divine wind" that would
sink the American fleet that was advancing on Japan.

Thereby demonstrating that they aren't using the brains that Allah
gave them.  If the Americans *really* wanted the various Islamic
countries destroyed, it'd be suborbital nukes and news at 11:00.

Why put "(sp?)" on it?  Why not take 10 seconds to bring up a search
engine and look?  Yes, you have it spelled correctly.  Another
spelling (the one I know and use) is matzoh.

And rumours such as that are further proof that the people involved
are too stupid to pour piss out of a boot.  The 'blood libel' has been
around for a long, long time.
