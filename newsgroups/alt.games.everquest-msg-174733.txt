I started quad-kiting at 29th with Bonds of Force and Column of
Lightning.
Get a KEI and a SOW (both usually available in Nexus).  Find a good
quad-kiting location (this is actually the hard part).  It should be a
fairly safe location (few adds) that is mostly flat  Pick mobs that
don't cast and are slower than SOW.  At 29th I started quad-kiting
Rockhoppers and Stonegrabbers in Maru-Seru.
This is a good zone to do it because the Recusco camps scattered about
will kill lightcrawlers and Zelniak adds for you.

After you aggro one (I used shock of lightning), run past 3 others so
you have 4 following you.  Four is the magic number for Column of
Lightning since it will hit 4 mobs.  Once they are trailing you, run
in a circle a couple times to bunch them up (change your perspective
to the overhead view).  Hit them with Bonds of force to slow them
down, then nuke them to death with Column of Lightning.  After most
are killed, you can use Shock of Lightning to kill any stragglers. 
Only hard parts are if any resist Bonds of force, you have to deal
with them first and any adds.  Either root them or lead back to the
pack and attempt to rebond them with Bonds of Force.

This spell (Bonds of force) changes the wizard class dramatically.  I
really wonder why wizards don't get a snare spell very early??

Takes some practice to get good at it (I died a couple times
misjudging the turn and getting whacked/stunned by 4 mobs).

When I first did it, I felt a tremendous rush!  I felt pretty godlike
and laughed out loud.  The true power of the Wizard class at last! But
after doing it many many times, it becomes the same old EP grind.  A
little more dangerous perhaps than root/blast but not much.
