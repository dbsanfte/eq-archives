So let me get this straight.  You regularly pay 25 or 30 pp for a port to the
next zone, so you can sell fine steel for 5 pp each?  And this is how you
*make* money?   I can see why you're poor enough that fine steel farming is
all thats keeping you afloat : P

Since when?  If you're of a level to get anything out of Sol A, B or Najenta
worth hauling to EC, you should have absolutely no problem getting through Nek
forrest, unless you're stupid enough to walk up and hail the newbie guards.

Sorry,  if you can't make it through Nek at level 40, you don't deserve to get
to your destination.   Let natural selection take its course.
