I would have to say conservative and reliable. The Toyota Avalon is
not a flashy car, but it features the strengths of the company
(reliablitly, economy, and safety). The XLS model indicates that you
like to pamper yourself with accessories and creature comforts.

If you are looking to upgrade anytime soon, I highly recommend a
Lexus. They are the finest examples of automotive engineering, and the
company treats thier customers like royalty. (Lexus is Toyotas Luxury
Car line in the US.) 

Druids = The class every one likes to hate when they aren't in need of
a SoW or Port.
