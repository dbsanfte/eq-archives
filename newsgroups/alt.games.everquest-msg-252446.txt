Something, sure.  But a marketed game?  The 4004 was mostly only used in 
calculators, although certainly some managed to tinker up more than that.  
The 8080 was probably the first chip in wide enough use for there to be an 
even vaguely standard platform to program to, much less market a game for.  
There may have been games marketed for it in that year it was out before a 
console hit the market.  But I don't remember them, personally.  Surely 
someone had ported ELIZA to an 8080 machine...? :) Once we get 6502's and 
z80's on the market, and Apple ][s, TRS-80s, and Commodore Pets, then I 
remember there being games, surely.  But that wasn't until 1976-77.

Basically, I think the cosole games market and the PC games market started 
nearly simultaneously.  And I think they've both been within an order of 
magnitude of the same size, fairly continuously, since then.
