Subject: Report on the availability of bread products from the South
Karana area.

   I posed as a traveling merchant wizard going between No. Karana and
our home, Neriak.  I did this run a few times to learn as much as
possible.  As a 22nd degree Wizard, the run is fairly safe.  I bound
myself beside a merchant in Neriak who wanted the bread and used my
personal port to the Wizard Spires in No. Karana.  The guards at the
river have no hatred for me, so I just ran across the bridge to the
centaur village in So. Karana.  As the centaurs have no reason to hate
me and everything else in the area knows to avoid me, nothing bothered
me along the way.  I bought the bread from the centaur baker and then
gated back to the merchant.  The merchant was quite pleased that the
bread is still hot from the ovens and pays me 2PP to 4PP per run for the
first trip each day.  Though, once his shelves were stocked, he only
paid 1PP to 2PP per load thereafter.  The whole round trip averages less
than 4 hours (about 11 minutes real time) including meditation time.
   After the first couple of runs, it was boring me to tears (actually,
to sleep).  I only learned a little from the experience.  One thing was
that the common laborer, having to run the whole way, would continue to
be underpaid and overworked, would be subject to many contingency
escapes resulting in even greater losses in time and money.   All to
deliver 3 to 4 day old bread.  But most of all, it demonstrates why the
common laborer is a common laborer.  They make the run time after time
and do not learn from the experience.  If they did, they would seek
other employment.  Even being a farmer in Nektulos Forest would be more
rewarding.  I have noticed that the northeast section of the forest is
quite calm and serene and has no troublesome creatures.  With
fertilizing ash from nearby Lavastorm, the area could be turned into
quite a profitable farm.  Failing that, a job as a hunter in the forest
should be profitable for most as more than 3/4 of the creatures in the
rest of Nektulos provide some form of food product.
   But I digress.  I believe the run would be boring even for a younger
wizard who had just obtained their No. Gate spell.  You can not make a
decent living at it and it leaves no time for your studies.  
   The only time I can think of that it would be of value is if you are
all ready in the Karana area and were heading for a town that needed the
bread.  Then you could pick up a little money and experience of dealing
with merchants or of helping those in need.

   It took me 3 real life session over 3 real life days to gain me the
3/4 of a level that I got from this quest.  I only made 6 runs after
achieving level 23.  Two of those were after the nerf.
   Before the nerf:  I used it to push me up from level 22.25 to level
23.  It was getting me about .6 blue-bubble of exp. per run at 22 and
when I hit 23 it was giving me just a little over .5 blue-bubbles per
run.  I was getting less exp. than I get hunting/camping (a
three-quarters of level 22 in about 31 runs or about 6 hours) but in a
much safer condition. (At least safer for the 20+ wizard because she can
avoid the run through the center of No. Karana or shorter because she
can avoid the long run to whichever town she's going to.)
   After the nerf:  I made the run to check the nerf amount.  Now, for
me from same merchant in Neriak, I get a little over one fourth a
blue-bubble per run.  Basically, that means it would take me over 15
hours to get through level 23.  Clearly, this is no longer worth the
trouble unless you are passing by anyway.

   I also noticed that after the first run or two on a given RL day, the
money received for the bread would drop from the 1 to 4 PP level to
about 1 to 2 PP level.  I'm guessing that once the merchant has stock
he/she pays less.
