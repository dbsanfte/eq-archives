Well, with my decidedly biased example an enchanter in EQ doesn't have to
wait much longer than that from OOM. ;)  'Course, my EQ DRUID did, and
that's why I moved my enchanter onto a second account...so he wouldn't have
to wait much more than 4 minutes from OOM.  HP regen for enchanters isn't
that bad...troll form for regen + bandaging does it pretty quickly.
