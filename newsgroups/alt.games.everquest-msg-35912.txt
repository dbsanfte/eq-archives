Everfrost is pretty hilly, you probably saw the "Z-axis filter"
in action when the person you were had targeted was a bit uphill
or downhill from you.

For some totally inexplicable reason, PC's (and *only* PC's)
which are more than about 20 "feet" above or below you can
blink out from view.  I can make this happen at will in Permafrost --
an entire dragon raid party of 40+ people can blink off my
screen if I climb one of the little ramps near the King spawn,
even though everyone's still close enough horizontally to
be within casting range.  If I climb back down a few feet,
they all blink back into view, then blink out again if I
walk back up to the top of the ramp.
