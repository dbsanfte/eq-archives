Here's the details of the quest:

The three scales are as follows:

1. Drops off of Azdalin, a named wurm in the Burning Woods.

2. Drops off of Gylton, a named wurm in the Burning Woods.

3. The third scale is found by talking to Lord Lyxfl of Burwood (apparantly
the alternate form of the wurm Xyfl) in the Temple of Solusek Ro. He wants a
piece of tektite and a peridot. Tektite is a gargoyle located in The
Overthere. Hand him two carnelians (or kill him) and you will get a piece of
Tektite.
