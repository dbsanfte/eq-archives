Bah!
Only if you pull something(s) you shouldn't be trying to solo or are
trained.  My L45 Paladin has been able to solo blues at every level, and
near half my experience has come from solo combat (no I don't play
Quake, Diablo, & etc., and no I am not interested in playing single
player games, take that BS strawman argument and ram it where the sun
don't shine, it is NOT necessary to use the EQ grouping game mechanic to
interact socially in-game).  That said, it is worth noting that solo
rhymes with "so slow" and that's how the xp is most places when you solo
a Paladin, you gotta travel and try new things when the old get stale or
you can spend weeks making a level if you're not in the mood to group.
