In one of his earlier works, Isaac Asimov postulated (going from memory
now, so not exact... sorry)

"God will survive until the last question has been answered."

His follow on commentary was always fascinating to me. Essentially, he
said that very early men saw a great ball of fire rising in the sky each
day and falling in the west in the evening. They had no explanation for
this. So "God" was pulling it across the sky in a chariot.

More and more examples followed of things that man attributed to "god",
but science later figured out other explanations. Each time, a little
piece of god died. And while we are still far from knowing everything,
IMO, we are getting down to where it's only the really BIG questions
digging back mind boggling distances into the past and the cosmos where
we're struggling and still attributing these things to "god".

Did a "big bang" create the universe? Was there a universe before there
was somebody to observe it? Science begins to devolve into philosophy at
this point, and from there it's only a short hop skip and a jump to
religion.

Ooooooooo! For those who havent' read it, while we're totally OT anyway,
pick up a copy of "As She Climbed Across the Table" by Jonathan Letham.
It's not only a fantastic read, (as I find all of Letham's work to be)
but it REALLY takes an interesting look at the nature of existance, the
universe, and reality itself, comparing the possibilities of creation to
the need for an observer to make such things extant in the first place.
