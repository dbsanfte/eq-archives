Who cares? If some kid is accustomed to eating his pasta with his hands,
should I revise my opinion of his piggish behavior when he does it in a
restaurant? I don't care *what* they are used to ... if they want something
of me, they can make a _real_ effort at being polite and understanding that
they are asking a favor of me, not a token gesture of false civility.

Almost across the board, my experience has been that it has. An idiot, or a
kid. And I don't care to deal with either.

That speaks volumes ...

Yes. If they want something of me, no matter how minor, they can take the
time to press the *THREE* *STINKING* extra keys it takes to say "please." If
you are unwilling to even attempt to show a bit of respect to the person you
are asking - and asking like a twit is disrespectful - you don't deserve a
gift, no matter what the gift is.

Who said it had to take two seconds? Three keys to six, you really think
it's *that* hard to cope with? If it really is *that* hard for you to cope
with, you ought to move on to another person. You'll get naught from me.

1) SoW is an acronym, PLZ is not.

2) SoW is a full 11 characters shorter than Spirit of Wolf, including
spaces. PLZ is a mere 3 shorter than please.

3) The "please" is a far more important aspect of the request than the
item/deed being requested. If somebody wants a teleport to BB, I do not
expect them to type out Butcherblock.

That's right. Typing "plz" shows their only "thought" is along these lines:
"My mother scolds me when I don't say please, that bitch. My mother scolds
me when I don't say please, that bitch. My mother ..."

Typing "please" says: "I will, at the very least, show you a touch of
appreciation and speak to you like a human being since I am about to ask a
favor of you."

Sorry, I'd rather not be in their shoes.
