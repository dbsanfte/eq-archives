Got a /tell last weekend from someone wanting to know if I could enchant
Brellium.  I said sure, how much did he need?

If it was 4 or 5 blocks, I'd have done it for nothing.  I enchant all kinds
of stuff for people doing quests, it's not a big deal.

He had 29 blocks.  At 325 mana each.  We're talking almost 3 full bars of
mana.

I tell him I'd do it for 500pp.  I could almost hear his indignation.  "But
you have C3!!!" It'd still take me 15 or 20 minutes sitting on my ass to
enchant all that.  But he didn't care, he just wanted me to stop what I was
doing and enchant this stuff for him for nothing.

Sheesh.
