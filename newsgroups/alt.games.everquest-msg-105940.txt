I'm a 34 Iksar Shammie half way done with my Epic one of the few remaining
things I have left is to kill Black Dire and return his pelt to the Spirit
in EJ.  Just like some helpful advice as to how to take this clown down and
live.  I know I could get a group of uber 50+'s to assist but would like
some advice for a group of not so uber people in the upper 30's and low
40's.  I know BD hits for 200 a shot or so just wanna have all my bases
covered.  Thanks again all.
