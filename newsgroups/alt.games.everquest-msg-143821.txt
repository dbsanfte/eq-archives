Best stacking for a druid is Potg/c, BoF, and a symbol - with the best
symbol, this combo gives better stats than aego and lets you retain
the mana regen of potc/g.

Mask of the Hunter has a lower mana cost than Mask of the Stalker, and
Hunter can only be cast outdoors. I have Hunter, so I have to run
outside every time I want to refresh the spell, but it has a very long
duration.

You have the mana cost backwards.

In total, you can stack kei, bladecoat, potc/g (and symbol and bof, or
aego instead of potc and those two), mask of the hunter/stalker.
Mask of the hunter/stalker does not stack with form of the howler.
Form of the hunter (level 60 wolf form) will stack, but sucks so badly
that I'll use my level 24 wolf form if I ever need to wolf for
faction.

Druids and shamans share the Elder title, by the way.

Dire charm? Exp? I use regular charm for exping, two kills for the
price of one (except for when lack of synch between me and the server
prevents my imp camo from actually casting until after my pet has been
killed by the other mob, grrrr) and no dire exp theft. I want dire
charm badly, but only so I can use it to farm panthers (pita green)
and geonids (dark/light blue, several shamans) in WL.
