Well the X cards are PCI Express and your going to want to check your MB for
compatibility.  The x600 replaces the 9600xt.  While quality varies, on the
basis of sheer speed the "x" cards below the 800 pro are slower than the
9700.  I recommended the 9800 pro as that is what I am currently using and
it is chewing up Doom 3 with no problems what so ever.
