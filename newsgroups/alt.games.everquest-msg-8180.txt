   Tonight, a level 2 wiz was shouting outside the
westgate in Freeport for a CR SoW in E commons.  I
was playing my level 4 high charisma "baking" 
enchanter, so I paid no mind.  Then the person added
"I've died four...no, five times now, and its starting
to just not be any fun anymore".  I sent her a tell 
offering to invis her.  She thought for a sec, then 
declared "That just might work".  I cast it on her, 
and off she went.  About ten minutes later, I sent a
tell asking if she made it.  She had, easily.
   SoW's for CR's are nice.  But the only thing that
will do in a difficult situation?  Hardly.

Annie  <--- Still would have SoWed her if she had
            playing her main, a Shaman of 19 seasons.
