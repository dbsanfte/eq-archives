That won't make the fights much shorter (7.5% Shorter, since I'll be in 
the back as well as the chanter pet), what it can do is decrease the 
down time as I won't take as much damage from the mob.  But fear kiting 
requires room, as even snared the mob continues to move till it gets 
down to death run; thus far we haven't been fighting in situations where 
it seemed worth while.

I fear kited a LOT with my cleric, so I do know the theory and practice, 
I'm just lacking a high ZEM spot where its a good idea do use it, at 
least thus far;  maybe as the mobs start desperately outdamaging us.
