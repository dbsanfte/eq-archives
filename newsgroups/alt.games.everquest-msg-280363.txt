Not per person they don't, but as a whole they do.  A good farmer will
get close to or more than 1k an hour in Rathe.  I can't remember the
last time I ever got anywhere near that from a group split after
several hours of XPing.  The entire group might get that much...  But
of course when you consider how many more people are out killing stuff
in those less-profitable zones the influx of money there is definitely
more substantial.
