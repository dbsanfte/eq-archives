You probably just happened to try to port up when there was a problem 
and the zone was down.  Try again. Or, umm, did you buy the Luclin 
expansion? Is it enabled on your server select screen? Can't go unless 
you buy the expansion.
You should get maps for Shadowhaven, Paludal caverns and Echo Caverns 
now before you go.  Then go to allakhazam and look up the register for 
trading quest in shadowhaven.  Follow the advice on that page and get 
your necklace.  Don't stop the quest until you get that necklace that's 
the most important part.
