In case this helps anyone else.....

One of our machines was unable to get past the character select screen.
After the splash page and the file loading bar, the screen would go
black and the machine would have to be rebooted to start again. Deleted
and reloaded the following file:

eqgfx_dx8.dll

Can log all the way in and play now.
