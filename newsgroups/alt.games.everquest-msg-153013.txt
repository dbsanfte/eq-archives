That is truely one thing I hate about EQ (no, not enough to make me want to
leave, and you can't have my stuff).  Rare drops off rare mobs.  If I have
to kill Phiney for my bard's epic, I danged well better have the spine drop
(whether I'm the bard that gets it is another question).  It's like the
Kromzek.... I just killed a giant, how on earth did it not drop a head?????
