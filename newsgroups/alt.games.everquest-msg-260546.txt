Sort of on-topic. I've played about 10 dungeons now, and every time I've
come across a chest, noone in the group has had any ideas except "bash it"
which usually results in bad things and no loot. Last time i suggested
trying to 'inspect' it but the warrior bashed it and it exploded.
Fortunately i had run away, having sort of got the hang of what he was
likely to do, and I could then rez the party. I know rogues can disarm it
but as a cleric I'm not quite sure what (if anything) I should do with them.

I bought lesser remove curse with all my accumulated adv. points (wow!) in
the belief it was connected somehow. Was this worth investing in or does
everyone else just skip it over?
