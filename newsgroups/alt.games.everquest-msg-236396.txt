Here's a link to a reply I made on the same subject a while back:

1.  Leadership XP actually comes out of your your regular leveling XP
(if it's turned on.  This is per Ryan Barker, AKA Rytan, a dev.)

2.  AFAICT you gain it anywhere (our group leader got a message 
regarding it in CoM doing the concussion quest.  That's a Kunark 
zone.) and the abilities can be used anywhere.

3.  I can't imagine you can even turn it on below level 50, and there's
no way you could get even 1 leadership point before you'd made it to
level 60+ (leadership xp is based on the difficulty of the mob as well
as the size of the group.  Our usual GL has gotten 1.5 leadership 
points in our trials so far in Barindu - this is against level 63-65
mobs.)

4.  What's the rush to 65?  Stop and smell the roses a bit or you'll
get burned out and think EQ's just a treadmill.

Finally:  Google is your friend.  Go there, go to groups and to
Alt.Games.Everquest and do searches on these things - you get much
information and no waiting.
