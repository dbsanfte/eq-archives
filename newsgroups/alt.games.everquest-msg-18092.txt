Oddly enough, people do this to my Magician occaisionally.  Bear in mind,
my Magician is also a Dark Elf.  I've been asked for Sow.  I've been asked
for Clarity, while my pet is sitting right behind me.  In one case, I
wasn't looking and someone handed a weapon that looked like a wand to my
pet, and some genius asked *it* for clarity.  (It's name was Kiber, I
think, and I'll admit that with the wand it almost might have looked like
an illusioned Enchanter.  If it hadn't been twisting the heads off
Deathfist Orcs at the time.)

I think it's just part of any endeavor.  You have the people who spend all
their time at a given activity and know absolutely anything there is to
know about it.  (They are variously known as proffesionals, experts, nerds,
or losers, depending on *what* activity is being discussed.)  You have the
people who don't know everything about it, but know enough to get by and to
generally avoid embarrassing themselves.  (These are the amatures,
hobbyists, or normal people.)  And you have the clueless clods who only
know about a tiny little piece of it (and most of that information is
wrong,) though they usually feel that they belong to the professional
category if you ask them.  Think Cliff Clayben from the TV show "Cheers."
