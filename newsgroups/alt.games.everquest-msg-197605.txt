Whether they wanted to join for power purposes or not they still had
to group with us, get to know us, pass our pre-initiation posting
procedure, and follow our rules which quite frequently gave outsiders
the same benefits we got in terms of chances at loot.  We were not a
raiding guild but a large collection of friends who happened to
include some truly stellar players. In a large raiding guild, there
probably would have been acceptable substitutes that could be swapped
out for people who had passed the trials thus lowering the cost on
each guild member, In our guild there wasn't, there were the few uber
players who were with us because of friendships, who were put upon to
help the rest. It stopped being fun for them and they left. Others
followed and  a chain reaction in three waves led people to leave
following their friends or going to a guild that could actually get
them through the trials. I bought the Gold Box eq expansion but right
around that time the guild began to tear itself apart and I lost all
interest in playing, an interest that had been mostly to play with my
friends again.
