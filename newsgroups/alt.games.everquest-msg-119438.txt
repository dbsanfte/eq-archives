No, because you have a very limited view of EQ, grouping, guilding, the 
high-end game, and basically anything other than your own little 
experience.  You bitch more about exploits than anyone I've ever seen, and 
seem to be able to find a way for anything to be an exploit.  Who the fuck 
cares that anyone can cast cancel magic on a mob and strip off buffs.  If 
you've played this long and it hasn't affected you before, then either it 
isn't a fucking problem or you're so fucking clueless that you hadn't 
noticed.  
A soloing caster may not have much reason to dispell mobs, but almost 
everyone else does.  A hasted mob does much more melee damage until 
dispelled, a DS on a mob tears up your damage dealers, especially monks, a 
mob with HP buffs it a lot harder to kill, a mob with MR buffs is almost 
impossible to land spells on.  Kiting mobs running at SoW speed suck, but 
once SoW is dispelled, they're easy.  Almost every raid-level mob in the 
game must be debuffed.  Hell, almost any ranger/druid class mob in the 
game needs to be debuffed unless you're ONLY root/nuking or root/rotting.  
Hell, even the lemming zones pretty much require Cancel Magic; I know as a 
bard I was expected to cast my version on every mob pulled in DL ridge.  
On certain mobs, especially the spiders, everyone who could would cast on 
Cancel Magic would, hoping to remove the most annoying buffs quickly.
