Have you ever tried setting textures in options to LOW?
I did and then the performance was about the same with ALL the new
models or NONE. The difference in graphic quality from high to low is
so small I'd rather have Low and all models.

Just for reference I was running a p2 400, tnt 16 meg agp, 384 meg
ram. Now I have 585 meg ram and its not all that big a diff except I
now have conservative swap on and EQ usually makes me use at most 540
meg ram and at worst all of it.
