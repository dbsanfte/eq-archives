[snip story of red sabertooth]

Of course, your group listing looks good until you look at the labels
you designated the different classes...

I've killed red sabertooth tigers with *one* tank partner and not much
danger to our lives. (Having to do with the fact that I know how to
heal, damage shield and utilize fear animal :) )
And I'm still getting melee increases with Lance's hit n med method,
without having to resort to really being a tank :)

Hope you left that group once you were done laughing at them :)
