>> Hi guys.  I was wondering if anyone knew a name of a green BP useable by
>> bards, BESIDES Singing Steel

I believe the Faydark Armour has a green tint.  And it's kinda made for bards
as it has a "charisma" bonus... You get it by completing the goblin
battlemaster quest and turning in 4 wristbands to a guy in Fironia Vie...
(The only problem is that you can end up with legs or wrists or ....)
