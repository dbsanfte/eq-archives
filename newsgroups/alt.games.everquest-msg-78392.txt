The absolutely safest place to "learn" swimming, without even
getting your feet wet, is in the lower level of the Blind Fish
tavern in Neriak.  (But I doubt your druid would be welcome
unless you did the Red Wine quest a lot.)

Jump up onto the sill of the big picture window that
faces into the lagoon, turn on autorun so that you're
running at the window, and watch your swimming skill increase.
Yes, really.

Apparently having your nose pressed up against aquarium
glass is the same as swimming.  :-)

But I don't recommend it, since you really should actually
*learn* to swim (i.e., navigate effectively in the water).
It's a fun trick, though.
