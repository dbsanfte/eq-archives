Wizard Spells:

Ancient Destruction of Ice + Iceflame of E'ci has the best damage to mana
ratio of any spell in the game, even more than Ancient Strike of Chaos, a 65
level GoD spell.  ASoC has a damage to mana ratio of 4.28 and ADoI is 4.80.
Team that up with Iceflame (which can boost it by up to 400 points, it
varies) and you have insane damage to mana ratio.  Say it does 1600 points
of damage at it's highest, you have a ratio of 6.4.

Cycle that with Ice spear of the Soloist (4.0 ratio, higher with Iceflame)
and you have two spells that potentially have better damage to mana ratio
most of the time than the best 65 level GoD nuke.
