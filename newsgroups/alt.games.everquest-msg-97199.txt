"Pogrom" was used SPECIFICALLY by the nazis in regards to the "answer to the
jewish problem in eastern europe".  I have never heard it used anywhere else.  
I find it extremely offensive.  It may slip by Verant's standards, just don't
ever ask any of me for a sow, buff, clarity, heal or rez :) if you go by that
name.
First impressions DO count in game...
