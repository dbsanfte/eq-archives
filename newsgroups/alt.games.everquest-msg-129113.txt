Just to throw in my 2c. I play a now 54 enchanter on Tarrew Marr.

I used to pull In dreadlands (think I started pulling around OT possibly
LoIO) The main reason being that while the cleric meds, I keep the tanks
hasted. Once that's complete and I have atleast 70m the best way to optimize
the group is keeping a line of mobs for the tanks. After all the group works
best when the melee's are melee'ing 100% of the time right?

I dont' know about most enchanters and how they play. But I do know that
during my time in OT and dreadlands I had past groupee's BEGGING to group
with me and my style of play. I still think that the best enchanters are
those extreamly hyper ones :) alot of my style still works in KC.

If I have enough mana to stop a train (And I mean 5-6 mob train) then I have
enough mana to create a train for my group to kill. scary way to look at it
possibly but like I said, I get compliments on my game play. I think I'm far
from the best enchanter. I have my days where Im lazy and don't wanna move
(except when I pull agro of course /snicker) but overall I think I do okay
:)

Long live Pulling enchanters (or short live enchanters who don't do it
right)
