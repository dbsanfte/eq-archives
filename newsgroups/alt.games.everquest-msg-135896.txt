Yes, I've been complaining about this too. I'll finally go up to 800x600
screen size if I can use font size bigger than what /chatfontsize 5 gives me
right now (like increase it to 6 or 7 at least).  I've thought about
replacing my 19" for a 21" or bigger, but look at the prices and see why
I've not done that.  But that brings up another question.  Why is a 21"
screen (CRT) so much more expensive (on average about 3 times the price)
than a 19"?  A 17" compared to a 19" isn't that much more.
