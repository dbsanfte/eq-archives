My experience has been since, as I only got into the beta on Thursday.  But 
with trying 4 different characters on beta 1, and deleting two and making a 
couple of new ones on beta 3, all 6 characters have always encountered 
trapped chests every time one has dropped.

I'd say by now I've seen somewhere around 20 chests or so.  Every one has 
been trapped for me.
