I felt the exact same way.  The newbieness of DAOC IS very cool.  You have
to REALLY think when you create a character...you have to decide what you
want to be when you hit level 5.

But don't cancel EQ quite yet.  See what happens in a month.  I'd be curious
to know if you start asking yourself "remind me again why I want to reach my
next level?  I've forgotten."
