The others cannot switch by betrayal.  For example you can choose
Scout-Predator and then either Assassin or Ranger depending upon which
city you are aligned with.  You need to betray before the final choice
and so you can't have an evil Ranger.

4 slots is very harsh.  I would like to have eight like I did in EQ1 (I
only played on one server)  That would give me enough time to assess
several classes to the point where I can either keep them or delete
them.  Something else that causes a problem for me is that if I were to
want to try all three types of Mage they are identical until level 10
and would only start to really change 2 or 3 levels later.  That means
that I would get bored of leveling Mage number 3 and so I would want to
relieve that bordem by playing my main or starting another alt of a
different archtype.  This would result in more alts (if I had that
luxury)

Twinking of alts is limited in that most (all?) equipment has a level
range.  So the limit of the twinking is that you could always have the
best that you can have rather than the best that someone 30 levels
above you could have.
