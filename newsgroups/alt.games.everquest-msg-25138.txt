Graphics are a bit stuttery in EQ.

Not too bad but this is a good card.  I just got it and will be taking
it back if I cannot fix the problem.

This is the closest that I can come on the eq site.

Where the hell is the triple buffer box on the server screen?

Can anyone help?


 Here is the solution:  Bad Graphics
 This is likely because you have a Geforce 2 64MB video card. Try going
into View/Advance Options and check marking the Triple Buffer box in the
server select
 screen.

Any help is much appreciated.
