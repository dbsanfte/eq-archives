You got Wrath at level 29, and at that level for for a short while
thereafter, it's a quite nice DD spell. As a cleric of that level
I remember being grouped with a 29 druid who was bragging about
how much damage her new DD did. I zipped my lips and snickered
to myself, knowing Wrath did more.

However, you don't get an upgrade for it until level 44, and by
then the other DD classes are leaving Wrath in the dust. 

Meanwhile, at level 34 you get Superior Healing and leave all
other healing classes in the dust for good. By the time shamans
and druids get Sup Heal, you have Complete Heal, Word of Health,
Remedy, Celestial Healing (if you're lucky enough to get it).

In short, give it a few more levels and your cleric will settle
into his role as the supreme healer. Healing isn't all you do,
either. Stuns are very important; clerics are among the best 
at that. And, your buffs are very valuable to tanks, even more
so in tandem with a shaman, since they stack.
