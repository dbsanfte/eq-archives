Not really.
In many exp grind zones (aka, Velks, Fungus, Chardok, etc...), you can
"run" from trains.  The problem with zones like Velks is that many of
those spiders are rogues, if you expose your backs to them (as it
happens when you attempt to run), you get those 200+ backstabs.  With
Innate Run 3, you can out run them pretty easily.

Regen and Run, nothing else is really important.

Yeah, and everyone has a bard stuffed up their ass to be pulled out
whenever it's convinient.

If built in JBoot speed is so useless, why do so many casters camp for
the AC?
