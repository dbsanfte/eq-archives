a) They could do it just temporarily if that were what were necessary,
b) Quitting playing alts *temporarily* does not turn you into a raiding 
guild
c) Putting in more time than usual wouldn't be necessary. You would just 
have to concentrate your efforts on the goal at hand. That's no strange 
concept.

They should be willing to do what is necessary to have what they want and 
not expect it to be given to them. If they eliminate everything hard in 
the damn game, there won't be much reason to play it.

Again, it all goes back to what matters. If playing with your guildmates 
matters to you, you will either play in a lower xp zone temporarily or 
work a little harder to get to a point where you could play in the same 
zones as your higher level friends. Naturally, they, being of like mind, 
should be more than willing to help your cause.

So they get the rest of the people they want to hunt with flagged ASAP. 
If those people aren't near ready for the trials, then *they* should work 
at getting that way. Besides, as the flagged people level higher, they 
become better able to help the rest through.
