Windows XP is not officially supported by Verant, so asking their tech 
support will not help. Everquest is a particularly unstable game - one 
of the most unstable and badly coded games I have played to date. 
Unfortunately troubleshooting anything under Windows is a stab in the 
dark. What you have to do is make sure you have all the latest drivers 
for your hardware installed, and make sure you have the latest Directx 
installed too. Make sure you are sharing no IRQ's and if you do then try 
changing your PCI slots.
