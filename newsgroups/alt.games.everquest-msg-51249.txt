How about if the level 60 ebaychanter went /lfg in Velks or Sebilis,
got a group, dished out buffs as requested, and then started nuking on
the first overpull instead of mezzing?

Heck, they might even have known the original owner and not known he'd
been ebayed, and so had no reason to expect that kind of behaviour.
And by the time they know they've got a clueless fuckwit on their
hands, they're out looking for rezzes.
