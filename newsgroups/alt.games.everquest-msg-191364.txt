    You just have to keep the mobs busy, and you'll be fine. We've never
noticed any global time constraint either, but we've never had problems with
this trial from the first time we tried it.

    Yes, that's the one. Our names for them are Three Rooms (the crazed one,
because you set up in all three rooms), and YMCA (because you have to save
the village people). I don't think I've ever seen any loot drop in YMCA,
whereas 3 Rooms drops some nice rewards for the effort.
