As I stated before.

There were NO faction messages. Had there been I would have been out of
there like a rat out of an aqueduct.

As far a asssisting my guild. I believe I was in a role-playing context. I
refused to assist the raiders in the attacks, but if they insisted on
continuing, I would give strength to my friends. The conflict between
commitment to a deity and loyalty to one's  friends comes up often.

It has also been posted (may be incorrect, but who knows) that Druid 55+
spells drop more often in PoG than anywhere else in the game. Should I
forego a chance at getting some powerful spells (including the Teddy-Bear of
Limited Aggression) because a Goddess who has yet to show me any sign of her
omniscient benevolence might throw a hissy-fit?

Finally, and slightly off-topic, for most (if not all) races, faction with
your deity is a non-issue. There should be more incentive for folks to
retain faction. The only reason I want the faction back is to see if it can
be done! My Epic Quest NPC's still like me so that's not an issue.

I will try the Muffin quest. I've done it before to raise Steel Warrior
faction so I could do Hero Bracer quest. It's just a PITA because I'm KOS in
WFP (as all 'good' PC's should be). Anyone on Errolisi Marr have Improved
Sup Camo for sale? /grin!
