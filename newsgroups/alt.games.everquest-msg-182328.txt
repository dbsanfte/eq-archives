O/T, but I created a halfling rogue of Brell as a Hole CR mule. I hadn't gotten
out the door of the guild hall before some nice cleric threw a drive-by Aego on
me. So, I figured "what the heck" and went out to kill stuff until the Aego wore
off. Got to level 6, I think.

When it wore off I decided to head to the Hole. Wrong again, some druid in Misty
threw a drive-by PotG on me. Hello a couple more levels.

Now he's finally in the Hole with 100pp in the bank and a few pieces of newbie
armor.
