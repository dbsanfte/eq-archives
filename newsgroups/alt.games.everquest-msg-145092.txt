In the same way it was founded mostly by whites, sure. So what? Does
that mean that Asian citizens should consider themselves second class
citizens when in a courtroom?


You seem to be arguing that the commandments should be posted in
courthouses because the legal system is based on them. I put it to you
that the *relevant* commandments would be arrived at by any civilized
society as a requirement of being civilized. "Don't murder people" is
a pretty basic necessity of any working society.

I'm not sure how "I oppose such a display" equates to having found a
middle ground.

What is your reaction to the thought that only the commandments that
actually pertain to modern law be posted? Let's exclude right off the
bat that one about having no other god, for example - it's downright
insulting.
