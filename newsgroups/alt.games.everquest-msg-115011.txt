*shrug*  Keep in mind that although it MIGHT be harder to write a game from
scratch where deleveling is possible, the game is over 3 years old and no
leveling changes have been made at all (except adding levels 2 years ago).

I can well imagine that leveling code is so spagetti-like that it would be
extremely difficult to re-write now.  I imagine they'd have to start it from
scratch, and I don't know about you, but we just got done beta testing
Luclin...I'm not really looking forward to beta testing the WHOLE game
again.
