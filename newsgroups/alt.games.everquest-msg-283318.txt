We're not really loot-centric, or even XP centric, but rather
fun-centric.  Do stuff we haven't done before.  Try things that may
very well get us wiped. Etc...
Not that we're stupid (ok, we are a little retarded, we admit it) but
we're not into the grind to to the top as fast as possible routine.
We get there eventually, but that's just a side effect of our play
style, which we like to call GET SOME!

Being able to take out named mobs that could very well wipe us, but
who we have a chance to kill, is what we're all about.

Also not interested in doing things the hard way, just the fun way.
We may have some leads for a guild alliance to do PoP progression so
we'll see how it plays out.  Personally I'd like to mow the BoT mob
just to look out his window...
