My spell lineup remains almost unchanged at all times, I have 3 slots 
that I change out situationally, one generally as a swappable buff slot,  
one for root or a spell needed for a raid, and one for a DoT, or some 
other spell needed for a raid.  I use ALT-# to cast spells, it's a lot 
faster than trying to find a spell gem with the mouse.
