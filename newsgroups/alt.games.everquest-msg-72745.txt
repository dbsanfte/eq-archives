No, that never occurred to us, because (apparently unlike you) we've
been around long enough to know that he's been here awhile.

It is incumbent upon anyone to learn how to do something before
attempting to do it.

You should take some time to familiarize yourself with the RFCs
regarding Usenet. It is by design a *plain text* medium. It is NOT,
nor should it ever be, an HTML medium.

As for getting a different news reader, well, maybe *you* like to use
a piece of shit news reader like Outlook Express, but why would I want
to downgrade?

Whatever they want, like flaming someone for posting incorrectly, for
