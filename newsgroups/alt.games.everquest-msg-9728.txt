Being the optimistic type, I think that is the point. My inner pessimist (and when
dealing with Verant, he gets a LOT of play-time) says that the coming famine will
jack up the prices of supplies (spices will now cost a gold each, etc.) and that
the meat drop rate will decrease dramatically (if the players are starving,
certainly the animals are, too, and don't have so much meat on their bones.) Fish,
too, will become scarce as rivers become poisoned and the plague will kill off
those mutant bats with three wings. As a result, baking will become hiddeously
expensive to do, meaning that players will STILL buy from merchants.
