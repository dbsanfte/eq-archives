It's part of the deal Sony made with George Lucas to get the rights to do
SWG.  Sony gave him all the stars from EQ so he could pointlessly add them
to the "original" movies for the DVD release and call them "special
editions".

Oh well...I can say one good thing about Lucas revising the movies.  That
finally got me off my lazy ass and to the store to buy a video capture
device.  Even as I type, I am ripping my Laserdiscs of the *real* Star Wars
movies, to make myself DVDs. :-)
