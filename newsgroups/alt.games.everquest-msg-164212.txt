Thought I'd bring a real world example; my 52 monk, with imbued fighters
stave, and Silver chitin handwraps couldn't keep darkpaw gnolls aggroing on
a lv 40 ranger with a wurmy and another weapon (can't remember but he said
it cost the same amount). Maybe I misunderstand aggro, after all pre-nerf i
used to solo, but the fact was, despite the fact my faction was far more
extreme that his (worked my way to apprehensive to the rangers of JP,
woohoo!), the gnolls kept ignoring me in favour of beating him bloody.. he
had no haste items btw.

Maybe IFS doesn't taunt? Maybe rangers have added taunt? I am not sure, but
the last time this happened i was grouped with a low 40's paladin who
consistently outdamaged me against drolvargs.

I am sure monks who've gone raiding and below to good guilds have not been
too hurt but he has, and to add insult to injury, the druid he groups with,
who started a year afterwards, is now passing him by in xp, due to the iksar
xp penalty, so he's just turning into an anchor rather than a team mate.

Also, with feign death, i haven't found it too useful at high level, since
the mobs tend to remember you anyway, and come running from miles away with
a nice train at their heels, unless you exit the game while feigned, which
really is an exploit when you think about it. (They don't read these groups
do they? If they do, I'd like to point out that no monk in the history of
norrath has ever succeeded at such a feat, and please don't nerf our feign
death too!)

On the plus side, the introduction of lots of mobs that can't be snared or
rooted and that can summon means that my druid (although more powerful than
my monk by a long shot) is now experiencing some situations where he is less
powerful than my monk, which, if I weren't two boxing anyway, would probably
amuse me in a vindictive sort of way.

Can anyone else think of situations where a monk is superior to a druid?
Assuming they have the same money for gear, same xp etc? Perhaps some hilly
zone where lev doesn't work?I was playing with a  warrior who had some
clicky lev thing going on, and all those hours running up and down the field
of bone's walls seemed a bit wasted. Anyone know what the name of that item
is?
