That solution sends you through the login server that the GM's
use rather than normal players. It works, because at any one
time there are infinitely fewer GM's logging on, so there's no
congestion. That's why you were able to log in.

There are two problems with this. One, login 3 has a lot less
bandwidth assigned to it, so it doesn't take too many people
to use it for it to start giving you errors.

Two, as this means GM's then can't log on, it pisses them off,
and SOE can and will ban your account if they catch you using
the GM login server. This has happened before, and also
recently.
