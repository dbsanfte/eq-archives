gems? Sellable gems go to about 160 pp (black sapphire). They don't drop
that often in sebilis, and you'd need a lot to go to 4k. 

Blue Diamons etc are out of question, as they get always rolled.

: too) and the cleric still decided to keep all gems to replace his dot costs,

You're a group. How can the cleric alone decid he keeps the stuff? Kick him out.
