Safest way I know now, barring a friendly druid or wizard, is take the boat
to Erudin, zone to Tox, run to wizzy spires, port up to Nexus, port down to
gfay, run to BBM, take boat to Freeport.  It will take a while, two boat
trips, and two Nexus ports, but it is fairly safe.  This assumes you have
SoL installed.  Otherwise, for hoofing it, you can either take one of the
two northern routes ( I hear that the Runnyeye one is faster), or instead,
from North Karana to South Karana to Lake Rathetear to Rathe Mountain to
Feerot to Innothule to S Ro to Oasis to N Ro to Freeport.  The southern
route is the only one I know of that allows you to bypass Kithikor, not sure
that it's particularly safer.  Kithikor is generally not a problem during
the daytime.
