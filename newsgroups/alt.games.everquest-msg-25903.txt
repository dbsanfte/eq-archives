Well, you can't even start the true "epic" (Staff of the Four) quest
until you hit level 50.

However, there are plenty of other good Wizard quests, including what
many think of as the first "epic", the Staff of The Wheel quest.  And
the best part is, you don't have to kill a single thing in order to
get hold of it..

Search out a wizard in Everfrost, guarded by a pair of famale
barbarian bodyguards.  Or just go to Graffes and spoil it all
yourself.
