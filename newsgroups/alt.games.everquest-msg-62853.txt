I had no problem training brass... I stood in a safe area and played DDD
for a few hours.... till my level maxed.

However, I tryed playing tarew's aquatic ayre for about 6 hours and got
not a single skill up.  That's while having my bamboo flute equipped.

I tried playing underwater for a while (about 5 minutes) and didn't get
any skill ups then either.

Is this busted in EQ?

Thanks
