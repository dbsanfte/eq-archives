It's always worked for me.  Because I don't like keeping track of recurring 
charges (and the game cards are a damned ripoff), I always get billing for 
one month, then immediately cancel billing.  Result -- I get charged for EQ 
for a month, and after the month is up, rather than get an automatic charge 
to my check card, I get a message from the game client telling me to re-up 
billing.

Convenient, if I've miscalculated and am low on funds.  Will also be nice 
if I ever choose to equit.  :>

Anyway, the end account stuff through the game has never let me down.
