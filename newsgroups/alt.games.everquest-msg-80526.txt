Just two quickies: The Crusaders are around your level, and they are in the
sewers, as I call it.
http://www.eqatlas.com/ctlowermap.html <--- This is where you need to be, in
those little pools of water. That is where I have found most of those
Crusader thingy's anyway. (You swim down from the Courtyard to here)

Also, on the crowd control: Don't underestimate the Cleric's Lull series :o)
