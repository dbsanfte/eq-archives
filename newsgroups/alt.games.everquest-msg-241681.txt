I've been trying to hunt the ancient cyclops for a while now to get the ring
of the ancients.  The new fabled ancient cyclops is too hard for me to hunt
on my own.  I've noticed the fabled cyclopses lately, but haven't seen any
regular ancient cyclopses.  Are they still around?  Do the regular ones
still spawn, or do I just have to wait until all this fabled-mob stuff is
over?

Does anyone know when the fabled mobs will go away?
