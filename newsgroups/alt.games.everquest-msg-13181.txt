	Well, I'm saying that I was standing right next to these MOBs and
been summoned inside them (which is irritating, because it means I can't
hit them when I was happily hitting them before). Moreover, we've used this
technique on Tukaarak, and he summoned our clerics repeatedly throughout
the battle. We positioned our clerics as close to Tukaarak as possible while
under the bridge, and were they above the bridge, they would have been in
melee range.

	We've never used it like that, because of the high casting time
on it and we normally have pretty good aggro control. We have used it as
a modified FD split, though. Two mages, two pullers, time those COHs, and
you split every time. It's a wonderful thing. =)

	Is that exploiting, though? I know Verant had no idea we'd
develop something like that, but it seems like a valid use of the spell
to me.
