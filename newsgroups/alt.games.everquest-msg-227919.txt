 >What is the purpose of them?

In our guild, we have at least two couples who are married
in RL and in-game. We have another few couples who are only
married in-game and are together a lot. Plus one who are
married in-game and are rarely together (I think they're
married. I'm not too sure on that.)

Then we have the messy divorces which have caused more than
a few hard feelings within the guild. Ick.

I've been playing almost a year now (a female playing a
female character) and have went through a lot of 'When
are you getting married?' Our guild is more of a role-
playing guild than others and, while I am okay with the
'You are evil and you must die!' part of RPing, I have no
desire to marry in-game.

But, if others do, I'll go and celebrate with them. :)

Tracey
