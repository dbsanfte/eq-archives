Traditionally we raid Sun, Mon, Wed, and Fri, with Friday being originally 
set aside for backfagging events.  Once no one any longer required 
backflags, Fri became just another raid night.  With the advent of Epic 1.5 
and everyone's apparent need to have it, Fridays have become "Epic Fridays." 
The rules state that the event in question must require at least 3 groups, 
the player request the raid in advancefrom an officer, and have posted all 
the relevant inforamtion about the encounter on the guild message board. 
Fri is also a suitable day to request any kind of personal raid that is not 
a target in guild progression.  On our first Epic Friday we had no one with 
sufficient epic quests completed, so we did Suled Dar's Shade for access to 
new VP.
