You've still not established that their billing us here *was* immoral or 
unethical.

You're now just getting silly. They are a corporate entity, the actions 
of which are largely dictated by what would likely be most profitable. 
Oddly enough, that quite often parallels what would make the largest 
segment of their customer base happy, or at the very least what would 
make the largest segment the least unhappy. 

I say they've scored on that one once again. I hear few people raising a 
real stink about it, but so far only one who has *claimed* to be 
cancelling their account.

That's right, so we should follow their example and behave in an 
unethical and immoral manner ourselves. That makes no sense at all. 

I don't know about you, but I do my best to maintain a certain level of 
integrity, regardless of the actions of a video game publisher.
