At one point in time Runnyeye was marked as the UK preferred server.
People saw that (like me) and created chars on it. It's not marked at
the UK preferred now but if you look at the load stats its busy during
UK peak times and low at off peak times. Unlike the other servers that
follow a pattern you would expect for US players. Which leads me to
believe there are a significant numbers of UK players on Runnyeye.
