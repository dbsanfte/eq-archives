Got a KEI on my baby Necro when passing through the Nexus. I popped in,
started to head to my destination portal and *BING* I had this icon in
my buff box. KEI! Someone had done the mass group AE KEI at the Nexus
hub. WooHoo! Level 11 with KEI is pretty much a constant yellow and low
red chain pulling death machine. That was the only time I ever
chain-cast pets. I'd fear and pet a social animal, then DoT and fear
it's adds. The pet took a beating, but was easily replaceable.

I was 15 before it wore off.
