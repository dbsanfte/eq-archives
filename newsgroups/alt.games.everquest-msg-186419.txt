I only ever root&rotted them because every time I ran out to pull
wanderers, I got jumped by something else.  Now, this is probably just
shitty luck on my part because the mob density isn't any higher there
that PoN from what I've seen.

Really, the idiot factor is low for me where ever I go because I'm a
goddamned vampire.  My playtime is from about midnight to 6am, so
usually there's about 12 people in PoN.  Which is nice.  I understand
your point though.

Good to know, thanks.

OP said he was 56, so I was limiting myself to stuff he could do.

Just out of idle curiosity, how long did it take you to kill one
Elysian?  At 59 I would get an occasional resist on WD, so I'm
assuming that would be more common when you where 53.

I'm only 60, and not in a raiding guild, so I don't see myself losing
my tunic any time soon.  The hat is nice too.

And, the elysians are good exp and as you said the loot is VERY nice.
My advice for a 56 is to get a buddy (another druid or a necro would
be good) and do it that way.  That's just me though.
