Yes, it is.  That's the reasoning behind many people's resentment for EQ,
the impossible leveling times.  Casual players have no chance to get to high
level, unless they've been playing since the release of the game.  To take
your first character from 1-50 will usually take somewhere between 720 and
1200 hours played.  Like, hours actually playing EverQuest.  Uberguilds
however can take a character from 1-50 by powerleveling in more like 50-100
hours.  Good luck! ;-)
