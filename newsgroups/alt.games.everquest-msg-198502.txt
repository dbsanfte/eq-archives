I'm thinking you're not the poor bastard who has to keep track of points. :p
My guild will never go to DKP (we're not as uber as yours, but at least we
can kill Vindi, Velk, HOT, etc. with no problems using only guild people)
but since I'm the one who would ultimately be stuck with that shit job, it's
not going to happen.
