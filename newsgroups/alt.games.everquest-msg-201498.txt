I don't think that this is the case. I think that non hell levels were 
made (marginally) harder to "make up" for the "removal" of hell levels.

It all depends on how seriously you take the statment that "it will 
still require the same amount of effort to reach 50" and also how you 
interpret "effort".

To me the implication was that while 1-10 were made fundamentally 
easier, 10 - 50 should be "as hard" as it was before the smoothing. This 
would imply that while the hell levels got easier the non hell levels 
got harder.

At the time of the change there was a lot of fear that people would 
somehow loose experience with the change.
Due to the way they implemented it this was impossible, but the 
implication was that if they had implemented the same change in a 
different way it could have happened.

Humm looking at it that way I guess you are right.
I have thought that there are otherways that they could have restacked 
the modifier that would have been fairer. One possibility would be to 
look at the number of mid blue kills solo it would have taken to level 
and then used this as the method of weighting, rather than raw xp. This 
would then factor in the fact that at 59 you can kill bigger things than 
you can at 51.

On the other hand just think how much faster 59 will be once you get there.

You have to remember that this is all supposition. I never used show EQ 
and SoE nerfed the xp information before these changes so there is no 
reliable information about what the numbers really are. I'm just making 
best guesses based on what SoE claim to have done and how loud the 
general population scream at various times.
In other words I'm basically pulling the numbers out of my arse, but I 
still recon that they are more or less (+/- 5%) right.
