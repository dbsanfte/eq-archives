Actually, at least on Nameless, the smaller Phlarg camp was never
camped.  I grouped from 14 to 16 but soloed right from 16 to 19 at
this camp in AMAZING time.

As a bard with Lull to safely single pull and the Regen song to
counteract the crud, it was a Bard's dream spot.  

I like to group but I was getting 2 full blue bubbles or more per kill
until some turned light blue at 18.  Even then, there were lots of
dark blues and the light blues were like a regular kill, XP wise,
compared to other places anyways.

It doesn't get any better than that!

I know, Shut UP, before they realize and nerf it.
