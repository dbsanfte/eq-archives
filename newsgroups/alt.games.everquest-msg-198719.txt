you should never need them again,  if your account password is forgotten you
can have them autogenerate one for ya, and if ya get hacked  or whatever,
all they want is your  billing info and credit card number, cd keys dont
play much of a role in it, matter oif fact they never asked for mine when i
was retrieving my account
