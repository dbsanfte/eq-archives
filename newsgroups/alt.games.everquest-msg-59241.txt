Given that I spent enough time on an enchanter to get one to level 60,
and enough time to figure out how to juggle the buffs given only 8
spell slots, I'm pretty confident when I say:  Haste and Mana regen
buffs are either at the same duration or so close to each other as to
make the issue moot.

In a *WELL* run group, melee damage should be the bulk of the damage
generated.  In a piss poor group, where you have caster trying to nuke
the piss outta mobs, you'll see stupidly high downtime.
