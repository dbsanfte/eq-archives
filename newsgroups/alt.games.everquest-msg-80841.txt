In addition, make sure you observe the button placement of your
ability keys between different chars. I had my sense heading button
mapped to ability 9 on one char to work up the skill automatically. I
logged my second char to sell some stuff in NFP and was on many
/ignore lists within minutes. Turns out my ability 9 on THAT character
was a LFG button.  :(

Evidently, EQ only used ONE config file for all chars?
