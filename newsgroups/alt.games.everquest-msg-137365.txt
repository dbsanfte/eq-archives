 It's not really. Except for the fact his AE has a knockback/snare
effect. Sorta like Cazic, really. Imagine trying to maintank Cazic while
blind and not knowing where he is. You're not going to hold aggro that
well. Sure, you can try having your back against the wall but it doesn't
always work that well.

 Yeah, if you aggro one you're usually going to get all 5 (or 6).

 We don't really have a problem with adds on TIV anymore and it goes
pretty smoothly. I'd rather fight IV twice than Greig once.
