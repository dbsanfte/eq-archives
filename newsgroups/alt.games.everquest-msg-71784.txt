This game *really* needs a "/pet shut up" command,
especially for those annoying shaman pets with their
incessant howling (during downtime) and barking
(during fights).

And for some reason, the meleeing pet always ends
up standing *right* next to me, so that the game
computes their position as "half an inch from your
ear" and sets the bark volume at "11".
