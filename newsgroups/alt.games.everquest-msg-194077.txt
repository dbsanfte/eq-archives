Naah, the one that is useful is;
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/server_status.jsp

But what would be enormously helpful if the arseholes at SOE could
understand world clocks.

HINT: IS the USA on daylight savings time by any chance?
PDT is Pacific DAYLIGHT Time, correct. 

So PT (Pacific Time) is GMT - 8, and
So PDT is GMT -7 ? Yes - No.

Is London on daylight saving time by any chance.

Hint, GMT does not shift with daylight saving folks.
London time might shift, but GMT doesn't.

This is the second time that I've noticed that the wrong GMT has been
listed on annoucements. Well, it is a bit hard to miss when you suddenly
get thrown to that message "Our login Server and registration processes
are temporarily congested" at a time when zones are almost empty.
