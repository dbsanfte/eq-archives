Odd. I'm more irritated by dying due to 'bad luck' then recklessness. If 
its a straightforward fight, and we should have one... and its wipeout 
because of misplaced fizzle that's just damned irritating.

But if I've pushed it to the edge on purpose, instead of safely evacing 
when I see the incoming train, and then it doesn't pan out and I die... 
then I cheefully accept it. I knew I was flirting with death; I rolled 
the dice and I lost, More often than not I win though, and those are the 
fights worth remembering. Nothing to tell of any one of the 5 dozen 
fights where the monk single pulled mobs out of the next room, one at a 
time, for six hours straight without incident. Its the one where the 
pull went wrong, and the group can choose to run or stick it out, 
chooses to stand, and actually prevails. (Those are the fights were you 
learn your limits, and where good players are weeded out from the 
average  ones. Those are the fights that are fun, and if I have to die 
every now and again to experience those fights so be it.
