Attempted snares, roots, ice based (Ice Comet) and fire based (damned if
I remember my 51 fire spell's name right now, but I always have it
loaded.) Fire was totally resisted.  Attempted to debuff her first with
staff of temp flux. Resisted on every click through the short fight
before we evacced. Didn't try a lightening. Didn't have one loaded up,
and I got the impression she wasn't willing to sit around while I memmed
one.

We didn't *attack* this bitch. Was running across the stream at the zone
wall looking for gnolls and she followed us up out of the water. The
fight happened on dry land. And yes... in the last 106 levels I've made
on my last two characters, I did figure out you can't attack things in
the water while you're on land. :-p.

No, my *former* main is a large, muscular, incredibly attractive (in a
savage, animalistic way) Troll Warrior, before whom you should bow in
humility and reverence. My new main is a black guy with a forehead that
he can rent out for billboard space, however.

Isn't your main some kinda dr00d?
;-)
