Ah the old fortunate unfortunate argument. They must have stolen it . They
must just be lucky . We all can agree on one thing they dont deserve it !

I dont have it because I am just unlucky . They stole my fair share !

At high corporate levels if you do not peform they will give your ass the
boot in a minute. My damn money in the form of stocks is not going to sit
around and put up with bullshit, vote any slacker out the damn door faster
than you would believe. Also perfectly willing to pay them 100 million if my
stock doubles :)
