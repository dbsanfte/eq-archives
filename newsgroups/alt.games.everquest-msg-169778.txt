    You mean you didn't kill Trak after everyone had teeth because you had
20 Blood Ember BPs and only one Cobalt BP? ;-)

    If Emperor was actually blown, I'd agree with you. But what they did
doesn't blow the spawn, just delay it for four hours. On my server there's a
few guilds that can kill Blood, but not Emperor and they do Blood for the
loot.

    If a GM saw them going after stuff out of spite, they'd eventually get
disbanded. You can't always beat someone to stuff without eventually having
to try and KS. At the very least CiH is going to have morale problems, both
from people with a heart getting tired of griefing and from lootwhores tired
of doing "old" mobs just to block someone.

    Maybe for you and your guild of second boxes! ;-) A modern-day enchanter
has that self-rune spell, which is incredible for resisting stuff. You know
those mobs you mez for High Priest? Our enchanters were tanking them,
slowed, until they could get the mez to land, and then tanked them to pull
them to the HP room after he died. (And he sure died fast. I'd never seen
that many rogues show up to a raid....) Between the runes and having all the
healers on the raid healing the enchanters, I can see it.

    That's a point to make to the GM when he shows up. Of course, what CiH
did next pretty much assured that any GM that showed up wouldn't listen to
them.

    Sounds like they killed the last one up. The way GMs interpret the
"triggered mob" rules, they'd get the spawn and not CiH.

    Did you see the thread on FoH's site? Seethur of CiH tried to start a
discussion there, claiming that his guild was wronged by the GM. That's when
the screenshots were posted of CiH blocking hallways in ogre form, and
/shouting at the GM "We'll have your job once this is posted to FoH's site!"
They sound like colossal knobs.
