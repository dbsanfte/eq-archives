Screw em. My experience has been that many EQ guilds, particularily
the "uber" guilds are full of pompous assholes with too high an
opinion of themselves. People need to remember this is a game. Way too
many high end players act like their uber equipment is a license to
act like a prick. Nobody owns the content in the game. We're all
paying the same amount to play.
