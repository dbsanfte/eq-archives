 And also this one:
 
 

Hello Folks,

Because there were so many posts that were not helpful, we found it necessary to clean this
boards in order to better
serve those of you who are still having problems. 

I hate to ask everyone who already have done so, but please post your problems again
following the guidelines here.

Again this is the forum to come to if you want help not to just complain. 

Also note we areanswering these post from the oldest to the newest and so "bumping" will
just put you further in line.
