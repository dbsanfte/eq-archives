I wonder why EQ has to enforce this.  Is it because Sony has companies 
in the EU?  What would happen if EQ did not have officies in EU?  Would 
the athorities automatically try to block EQ?  Enforcing a tax like that 
would be difficult if were strictly in anohter contry.  What could they 
do then?  Block EQ?
