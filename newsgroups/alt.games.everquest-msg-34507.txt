It's possible I didn't make myself clear enough, but I really don't
believe so. I repeatedly acknowledged the guy threatened Lokari, 
and the guy threatened Lokari's account.

In fact I said on a few occasions, "..the guy threatened Lokari's account
but her account wasn't threatened " and asked if that was understandable
to the people I responded to.

I really think a complete review of what I said would leave little doubt 
as to what I was getting at.
