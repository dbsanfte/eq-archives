The guides aren't going to have access to the logs immediately, and a 
/report may or may not prove it to their satisfaction.  Remember, Verant 
is a largish organization and has set procedures that they follow.  I 
would not be at all suprised if there is a GM policy that states that CS 
resses will be given to anyone who petitions about the falling bug in zone 
X at loc abc, xyz.  If you've moved your corpse then you have to convince 
them that you died due to the bug via other means, including report.  Of 
course now they have to use their best judgement and weigh your word and a 
report against a clear cut policy.  You might get lucky, or you might not.
Why would you move your corpse in this case?  I would think after 3 years 
of EQ you would have figured out that if you are reporting a bug you want 
to ensure that the GM/Guide has clear evidence to go on.  A moved corpse 
certainly detracts from that.
