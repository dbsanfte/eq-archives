    Here's hoping they changed the "feature" Meemers first saw last night,
and which was keeping my guild entertained:

    If you put HTML in a message in any channel, people using the new UI
will see the message as the HTML would dictate.

    So, for example, we faked cyber mistells to everyone in guild chat,
people were sending fake Avatar of War flurry messages to everyone with
shout turned on in Kael, everyone within range of /say could see our
exceptional luck on dice rolls, and at one point after killing the Emperor
everyone in our guild got the message that we'd killed Emperor Crush, we got
party experience, congrats on level 60!

    The malicious applications were many. If someone wanted they could fake
dice rolls for loot, tell an entire raid (or at least the ones using the new
UI) to camp out or not camp out in their guild chat, and there was even a
report that bad HTML could crash a zone. Ugh.

    James
