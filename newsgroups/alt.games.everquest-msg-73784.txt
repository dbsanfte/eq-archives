I think that the Nexus is already a HUGE step forwards towards what
you're talking about, compared to the last couple years, and expecting
any more from VI at this point is just dreaming. With the advent of the
Nexus, people unable to port themselves, or find one, are still able to
get to fairly good locations on four continents, plus the moon, all
within the time required for two portal firings. (Which is sitll going
to be a lot less than several boats and hoofing it across multiple
zones, even with SoW.) We needed to get people over to the Hole the
other day. Normally, this is a huge pain in the butt when, (as was the
case, then) all of the guild's porters were already in good groups that
we didn't want to yank them out of just for a ride. The folks we needed
went to NK and DL, shot up and then down to Tox, and were at the Hole in
a very reasonable time. I dont' see more improvements in our "mass
transit" system to be required at this point, and am just happy with
what we've recently gotten.
