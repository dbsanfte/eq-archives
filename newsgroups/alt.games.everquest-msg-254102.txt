That definately argues in favour of not putting a lot of effort into 
it... but holding back the one point seems more effort than actually 
just spending it, figuring you'll see it sitting there waiting to be 
trained every time you visit a guildmaster for the rest of your career.

That was alot more true a while ago than it is today, the graphics 
revamps seem to have really brightened the world up. I remember staring 
at black screens zoning from BB to everfrost, or from QH to Surefall... 
even from south to north qeynos at night could be a challenge if you 
weren't paying attention. Now, I have little trouble seeing anywhere, 
even with Erudites.
