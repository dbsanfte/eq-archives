There's a pretty simple solution my druid used: if you are feeling
mercenary, name a price ("I can do it for 50pp").  If you are feeling
busy, just say, "Sorry, I'm busy".  Worked for my druid for 56
levels... don't recall ever getting hassled if I said I was too busy
to port.

If you're thinking that you shouldn't *have* to talk to people, it
might be time to look into single-player games.
