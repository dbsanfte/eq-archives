I recently ran into a nice chunk of pp from a friend that quit the game. 
I have about 50k and I am looking into upgrading my Beastlord. 

I am in a small family guild, so raiding for most gear is out. About the 
best I could manage would be a full group of 62-65 (not counting my 57 
bst) for any kind of armor drop or quest.

The gear available in the Bazaar changes from day to day on Torv, so I 
am hesitant in buying without knowing what I should be looking for. 
Because once this pp is gone, it will be quite some time before I have 
quite so much again.

Any input would be greatly appreciated!
