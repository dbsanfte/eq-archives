There is none I don't think. They started doing that for me too quite
a while back (having that funny flat gray door) instead of what I
think used to be fire? I was on a tnt 16 meg agp card at the time, now
I got a new geforce 2 mx400 64 meg for 45 bucks (WOW, what a
difference ;) ) The ovens and stuff are still like that for me, even
though I now certainly have dynamic lights on and particle density on
high (to see most flames it just has to be medium or high)

So I think everyone sees them like this now. I remember it happened
all of a sudden after a patch I think. Once it changed no matter what
drivers or settings I have they are always like that.
