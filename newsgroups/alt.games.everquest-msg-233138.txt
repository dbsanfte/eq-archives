Heal, then sit the rest of the time. Don't be a dopey cleric who beats
on the mob as well. If sitting most of a fight and standing to get a
heal off is not your idea of fun, be another class. 

Also, correct people when there is another healer in the group and
they say "Ok, one of us nukes and the other heals." This equals death.
Say, no we are both healers so we both heal.

Make an alias short cut that says something like

Lesser heal on <t>

then casts the spell.

Mine is something like,

Healed <t> <r>  with Chloroblast

with my druid, I forget the exact way that <t> is done, 
but that does something like thier name and race so its kind of
obvious. 

The alias is to make it clear to the other healer you are healing.
Like my druid might be casting a heal but see the cleric saying they
are complete healing the person. Then I calculate and if its going to
be close AT ALL, my druid heals them once anyway. Chlorblast is WAY
faster than complete heal.

Even if a cleric is the main healer, my druid will still only put dots
on the mob and maybe damage shield the tank. Then I also sit until I'm
doing it again or healing. So a cleric should NEVER be nuking, even if
there are two or more. Having two or more clerics, then being oom and
still having someone die just makes you feel like an idiot. Then idiot
number one always says, "well, I was supposed to be nuking so it
wasn't my fault!"
