Nope, sorry to dissappoint. I have tried many lagers (and ales) but only
Budweiser does it for me. Would love to say I drink Baptist's Ringpiece
extra strong ale or something equally obscure but this wide selection of
wonderful beers taste like they are the contents of drip trays to me.

Not sure if Bud is resented for it's commercialism or the fact it's American
but if I found a beer I like as much I'd drink it instead.
