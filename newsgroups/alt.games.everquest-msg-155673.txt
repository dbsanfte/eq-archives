It doesn't stop it being used in the same way, it just means instead of
getting 2 sticks and moving up from Vox, your still needing to kill her time
and time again

Ever had a wipeout so deep in the zone that theres absolutely no way a
cleric could have camped?   So far in or so tough to break that you couldnt
fight your way back in naked, and only a skilled monk could flop his way to
the wipeout, to stick people

Its not a tactic my guild relies on or uses a lot.. heck we only have 1 monk
in the whole guild who has any rez sticks (if he isnt on, we fight all the
way down ST, if he is on, we clear the first 2 named, clear the library,
then CoH to the third named)

Yeah, cuz god forbid anything that can prevent 6 hour+ C.R's is a bad thing

I helped some friends in a small guild who had a very nasty break in PoF.
So nasty virtually the whole zone was agrod and upheaved, every attempt at
rezzing in at the bunker resulted in death, every attempt to run anybody in
the zone resulted in an almost instantaneous death

40+ people level 46-52 or so with corpses scattered all over the plane,
generally 2-3 corpses each (from where they'd tried to re-break naked before
asking for help)

That mess took 8 hours to clean up, in the end it involved 2 monks (me and
the rez stick guildie) killing the north wall wandering mobs, then rezzing a
cleric who could finally start rezzing people (most corpses being too old
meant they all had to re-break, be c.r'd and rezzed, and then finally move
to the bunker to loot their main corpses

But right, the rez stick is a lame sploit tool for uber guilds

40k to recharge snare glands

How is preventing summoning an entire raid to the zone line, wasting hours
and thousands in plat and having to call the raid an exploit?

Way to jump to conclusions man
