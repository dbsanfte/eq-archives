It's a hard call - I played EQ for 2 1/2 years and was reaching
a point of terminal burnout.  I really don't enjoy the 50+ game
much, but still like the mid levels.

DAoC is a lot of fun, and I'm having a great time, I'm not sure
I'll even try Luclin now.

It won't hurt to wait and see if they come back.  If you decide
to try DAoC, catching up to your friends will be easy.  Grouping
is designed to allow players with less time to stay fairly close
to their friends with more time.
