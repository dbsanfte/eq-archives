W95 was a revolutionary step above DOS and W3.1, not evolutionary.

Without revolutions you would just be playing a bigger, longer Zork
with a bigger, more annoying maze.

It's the creativity that comes with revolutions that you would have
squelched with your attitude of "pander to the lowest common
denominator".

Wizardry would never have been made.
Ultima 4 would have have been made.
Ultima 7.
Wasteland.
Fallout.
UO itself would never have been made.
EQ would never have been made.

I think I'll go with the visionaries. Your attitude reeks of the
marketting weasels and the bean counters.
