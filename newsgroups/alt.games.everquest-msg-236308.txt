Obviously.  And therein lies your problem.

A bit of friendly advice:  If you want anyone to
give a shit about you, first you're going to have
to learn a) how to give a shit for other people,
and b) while you're obviously enjoying the infantile
urge to indulge your own wants and to hell with what
effect that might have on anyone else, this is a
poor long-term strategy.

You're free to be as annoying and inconsiderate
as you like, we're also free to consider you an asshole
and respond appropriately.
