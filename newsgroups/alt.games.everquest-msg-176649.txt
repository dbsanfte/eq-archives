Ok, this is going to be long, but if you are either interested in caster
AA skills or knowledgable in this area and want to help, this post may
be for you. :-)

With my nose to the grindstone, I've been making my way through level 59
with my wizard to finally make it to sorcerer. (59 is SUCH a fucking
picnic. Don't even get me started.) It looks like this weekend or early
next week I should make it if things go well.

At that point, I'm getting a safety yellow then shutting off regular xp
and grinding out the AA I want. (Yes, I know there's more than one
school of thought on this, but I've already decided it, so let's just
give that debate a miss, shall we?)

Originally I only got 3 points of AA to get run speed 3. I've never
regretted it. While it may be odd, I plan on doing first aid for my
second three so I can bandage to 80%. (Again, that's pretty much set in
stone. Let's not argue about how much better natural regen is.)

I had *thought* I'd already charted out a course for the rest of them,
but it seems to change day by day, so I wanted to solicit some opinions
on what Archtype and Class skills to focus on in which order for my
wizard. This is remembering that some archtypes are prerequisites for
certain Class types. Also taking into account that I'm going to be
applying to a (roughly) tier two raiding guild in the coming weeks, so
my needs may be changing over what they were in my old "family style"
guild where there was mostly just grouping or very low end raids.

For Archtype, we're looking at these:
(If you already know them all, just skip down to the next line of stars)
******************************************************
Channeling Focus: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the
chances of spell interruption due to damage or movement. 

Mental Clarity: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level improves the
character's ability to recover mana. Each skill level increases the
character's base mana recovery by one point every six seconds. 

Spell Casting Deftness: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the
casting time for beneficial spells with a casting time greater than four
seconds. 

Spell Casting Expertise: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level negates any
chance of spell failure (fizzle) for spells of a certain level. (max
level 52 spells)

Spell Casting Fury: (3 skill levels) - Gives the caster the ability to
do 'critical' damage with direct damage spells. Each skill level
increases
the chance to do critical damage with a direct damage spell. 2%, 4%, and
7%. 

Spell Casting Mastery: (3 skill levels) - Each skill increases the
caster's chance of successfully using his specialization skill for the
spell he is casting. 5%, 15% and 30%. 

Spell Casting Subtlety: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the
amount of attention (hate) casting spells generates for the caster. 5%,
10% and 20%.
****************************************************** 

To my way of thinking, channeling focus is a novelty. Mental Clarity,
beyond one level of it anyway, is a huge investment of AA for damned
little mana regen. However, all three levels of it are required for
Manaburn. That's been nerfed to fuck and back, so it's not the first
Class type AA skill I'm going for, I think. Deftness and expertise look
useless. Fury, Mastery, and Subtlety all look like things I would like
my wizard to have, and pretty much in that order. Like many, I really
plan on only getting the minimum 12 points in archtypes so I can move on
to some class ones and maybe come back for more archtypes later on. Thus
far, Fury is my choice for my first archtype, coming back later on for
master and subtlety in that order. This is *unless* I decide to get
Manaburn, which will make me spend on Mental Clarity. What do you think?

Ok, moving on to the class skills, we have:
(Again, skip down if you know them all.)
*******************************************************
Exodus: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability gives the
power to cast the spell Succor (Evacuate group to safe spot in zone)
instantly and without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure or
mana. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game
time). 

Improved Familiar: (1 skill level - cost 9 skill points) - This ability
improves the Wizard's familiar, making it immune to spells and resistant
to melee damage. 

Mana Burn: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points - Prerequisite: 3 skill
levels of the Caster Archetype ability Mental Clarity) - This ability
gives the Wizard the power to expend all of his remaining mana and do
damage directly to the target. The damage done is greater than the value
of the mana expended and can not be resisted by the target. The Refresh
Timer for this ability is 144 minutes (two days of game time). 

Nexus Gate: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability allows
the Wizard to instantly gate to The Nexus without the memorization of a
spell or the expenditure of mana. The Refresh Timer for this ability is
72 minutes (one day of game time). 

Quick Direct Damage: (3 skill levels - Prerequisite: 3 skill levels of
the Priest Archetype ability Spell Casting Fury) - Each skill level
reduces the casting time of direct damage spells by 2%, 5% and 10%. 

Quick Evacuation: (3 skill levels) - Each skill level reduces the
casting time for evacuation spells by 10%, 25% and 50%. 

Spell Casting Fury Mastery: (3 skill levels - Prerequisite: - 3 skill
levels of the Caster Archetype ability Spell Casting Fury) - Improves
the Wizard's ability to do 'critical' damage with direct damage spells.
Each skill level increases the chance to do critical damage with a
direct damage spell. (Oddly, they don't tell you the percentages on this
one.) 

Strong Root: (1 skill level - cost 5 skill points) - This ability gives
the Wizard the power to cast a powerful root spell that is nearly
irresistible without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of
mana. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (one day of game
time). 
************************************************************

The only one that looks totaly useless now is improved familiar. (But I
thought I read that there was either an addition or change that gave an
"Improved Familiar" via AA that summoned a better Familiar instantly
with no mana? Or is that a PoP AA?)

Other than that, SCFM certainly looks the most tempting, but I just wish
they would tell you the percentages on it. Exodus is very cool. (So is
nexus gate, but if you have exodus, that moves way down the list, IMO.)
Quick direct damage looks nice in theory, but that's a fuckload of AA
just to get a 10% reduction on spells that don't take that long to cast
anyway, as I see it. Quick evacuation looks VERY nice for group
situations, as opposed to raids, and Strong Root looks fun, but's more
of a situational thing or toy given the recycle time. I dont' even want
to think about the Manaburn nerf for fear of my blood pressure going
supercritical, but I understand that raiding guilds still find a need
for this on certain large targets. So I guess it should be put in as a
priority at *some* point.

So right now I'm thinking SCFM, Exodus, Manaburn (with it's prereqs) and
Quick Evac.

I'm open for suggestions or just observations on the relative merits of
these abilities. Also corrections and additions if the Sony site where I
got these is out of date or just plain fucking wrong. (What? A mistake
on Sony's web site? Naaaaaaaaaaaaaw. NEVER!)
