You must be one of those addicts that will be waiting behind the
computer....

*tap* *tap* Are they up yet? Clickediclick! Aaaargh no!

Get a life and do something else :) Them servers will be up eventually you
know.....

And you can always go to CoH, but you never will. You will continue to play
Everquest no matter how many patches, not matter how many bugs, not matter
how many downtime. The worst bugs have already passed, you did not stop
playing then, you will not stop playing now :)
