It's better than the single target Alacrity, not as good as Swift Like The 
Wind.  It's a 50% group haste buff, which is the same as the single target 
Celerity spell.  For a melee heavy group, It would be handy, and in a raid 
with no clicky chanter, it could be handy.  It is a level 64 spell though.  
OK, it's a new group buff, it's not a new spell, how is that?
