  It is annoying for a few quests (and trade skills), but for most quests,
it can be circumvented easily enough.  For the most part it does what its
supposed to (to make farming more trouble than its worth).

> What are these chat channels that suppossedly let you get around the

  Type /join (channelname).  One of the established and probably most-used
channels on the server is the market.  So you type /join market.  Type /list
to see a numbered list of all the channels you're in.  If market is channel
1, then you type /1 to send a message on this channel.  You can also send
"chat tells" by typing I think it's /chat tell (name)... so if you want to
send a chat tell to Tukka, type /chat tell Tukka Hey there.  The tell will
go through without a language barrier.

  Like I said, they probably will eventually nerf channels in one way or
another on this server, but until then, you can use this to get around the
barrier pretty effectively.  Once you're around level 15-20, I recommend
that you learn Human and Elven as soon as possible.  With those two
languages under your belt, if you're a good aligned character, you should be
able to communicate with 99% of the people you'd want to group with.
Learning languages on this server takes an hour or so per language, but its
worth the investment.

  I'm not sure about this, I think the alignment selection process is still
a little buggy.  I was never given the option to change my alignment since
my character is an erudite shadow knight, and the only alignment they have
available to them is Orderly-Evil.  Ever since I hit level 10, every time I
level up, it tells me that I can "now change my alignment"... I have tried
selecting Orderly-Evil to get the message to go away, but it persists.  I've
given up on it.

  That said, I do know that several people have succeeded in changing their
alignment without much trouble.  Maybe you have the syntax or the number
wrong?  If not, maybe you should try petitioning.

  http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie is the most often used server board.

  I don't associate much with neutral and good characters, so I don't have a
good idea about what guild to join for that.

  I spent level 9-15 primarily in the Warrens with my character on FV.
Sometimes finding a group was difficult (partially because I was Evil... if
I had been neutral, I probably would've been able to get into twice as many
groups as I did), but it's cool.  I've been raiding places like Skyshrine
and the Tower of Frozen Shadow with some of the same people I struggled
through my first few levels with in the Warrens. :)
