One thing I forgot to mention in my other post.  When I was
grouping frequently with the same Cleric I developed a bit
of rapport with him regarding healing, where I would often
drop a heal on the MT if it looked like a CHeal might land
a bit late, or I would chain-heal the MT during the chaos
while a bad pull or train was being brought under control
if the Cleric came under attack (chain-healed the Cleric
a few times as well).  The thing to remember about patch
healing of this sort is that once you start you need to be
consistent as the Clerics you do it with will come to expect
it of you and will adjust their healing tactics accordingly
(or they will if they're worth a damn anyway).  This means
that you have to be watching the group's health just as
closely as a Cleric does and be ready to duck out of a nuke
or DoT to toss a heal in where the Cleric's going to expect
it.  OTOH, it makes you more useful in a group that has a
Cleric in it and allows your group to cope with tougher mobs
and situations than they would otherwise (i.e. it helps to
make you a vital contributor to the group rather than just a
spare who adds a little DPS and might be able to heal or at
least evac if the Cleric LDs).  Just remember that with a
Cleric in the group healing is (presumably) a group strength
so if you can enhance that strength in any meaningful way
you have made the group stronger.
