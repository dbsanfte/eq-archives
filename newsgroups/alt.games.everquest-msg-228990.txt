This is too funny... I used to make the journey from Qeynos Hills to NK with
bags *full* of greater lightstones to fulfill the quest at the Gypsy Camp. 
There was nothing more exciting than that trip.  No sow, no invis, no twink
gear.  
One time I was unfortunate enough to pick up a couple of griffawns / griffons,
which I had never seen before.  I ran into the tavern / liquor store to get
away from them.  I was surprised to find a couple of other people in there, and
quickly told them of the danger at hand.  In mid sentence I got *hit*.  So then
I *said* "run for your lives, I'll hold them off"... because they were clearly
robe guys and I was a ranger!  
One second later I was dead.
I sent a /tell to the one I could remember apologizing for bringing them to a
certain death, explaining that I thought the building would offer a safe haven.
 The guy just laughed, said they were fine, and I would soon receive a *rez*.  
I had no idea what that meant and told him so.  He said just to say *yes*,
which I did.  
Next thing I knew I was back in the liquor store naked, staring at my own
corpse.  It was the wierdest experience, and quite embarrassing.  I looted my
corpse quickly to make it go away.   *Then* one of them gave me *the foot
spell*, so I could get home quickly.  
I miss the good old days sometimes...
(I've always been uncomfortable in the presence of corpses, since day one.  It
took me a long time to get used to seeing people standing around chatting while
there were corpses all over the ground.  Yuck!)
