 I agree with the Necro, and would add the Shadow Knight. Never played a
Bard so I cannot comment. But I did take an SK from  to lvl 52 with about
90% solo time. I still solo a lot, but it's getting difficult. I would say
from personal play time, after lvl 50, grouping has more advantages by far.

As far as the Druid and Shammy, that's gonna be some very slow leveling and
many deaths.

Just my two cents.
