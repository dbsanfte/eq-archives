Use a fast 1HB to get your skill up somewhere close to the other
skills; there's occasional 1HB weapons out there that are useful.

For my off-hand I carry 3 weapons:

Embalmer's, which I use until I've got a couple of stacks of bandages,
then use it again to top up occasionally.

Serrated Bone Dirk, because I love Engulfing Darkness.  Doesn't happen
quite as often as I'd wish, but every bit helps.

Polished Granite Tomahawk, because even temporary invulnerability is
better than none.
