There is no significant difference between altruism and hedonism, as far 
as I'm concerned. Hedonism is directed at oneself, altruism is directed 
at others, but the aim of both is to minimize pain and maximize pleasure. 
I agree with you in that, when you risk your life for others, you aren't 
carrying out a complex calculation of the possible balance of pain and 
pleasure at the outcome; you just do it, but that's the way most of us 
are wired. For most people, to see others in distress causes such 
distress that it overrules any other considerations.
