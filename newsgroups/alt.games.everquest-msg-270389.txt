How were your other internet activities during that time?  I suspect that
you, like most people on DSL, have a very limited upload bandwidth.  I know
that before I figured out how to throttle the upload side of my connection I
could saturate it to the point where it would severely impact my download
bandwidth.  The simple explanation for this is that your computer has to
"upload" a request for more stuff to download, and if your upload bandwidth
is saturated, it doesn't matter if you've got tons of unused download
bandwidth, cause your computer can't get a message out asking for more to
download.
