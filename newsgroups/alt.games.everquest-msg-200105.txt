I have always thought they needed to change the mana and health regen
rates. To do what Dark Age of Camelot did would work great.
While in combat/aggro'd by something, your regen is 'normal' or like
we are used to it today.
When not aggroed/in combat, you regen at a good useful rate. No 30
minutes of downtime between pulls for a warrior.

Also, the rates varied somewhat. regen rates for the first 50% of
health or mana was slower than the regen for the second 50%.
Basically, you could manage health and mana to have it above half
after combat so you would regen at a higher rate.

Imagine being able to solo a warrior effectively. Pulling a single
blue, beating it down, and only having a couple of minutes rest to
regenerate.

Basing it on aggro would prevent kiters from having an unfair
advantage. They could still kite, but would have to manage mana as
they always have or risk running out while the critter is still alive
and ticked off.
