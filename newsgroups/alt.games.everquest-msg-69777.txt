win9x can handle up to 1.3 gig or so really. More than 512 meg you
simply have to put a limitation on the vcache if you have out of
memory errors, which is something a four yeah old could accomplish.
This will cause no problems either since you don't want a big chunk of
your memory being used as a file cache anyway. For example for 768 meg
ram a conservative limit would probably be 128 meg ram but really
quite a bit less than that if you want as much free mem as possible
for games. Win 9X should really be built to adjust this on its own but
it doesn't. 

Many gamers now run win 98 or other win 9x with 768 or 1 gig of ram
and are perfectly fine and stable.

"CAUSE
The Windows 32-bit protected-mode cache driver (Vcache) determines the
maximum cache size based on the amount of RAM that is present when
Windows starts. Vcache then reserves enough memory addresses to permit
it to access a cache of the maximum size so that it can increase the
cache to that size if needed. These addresses are allocated in a range
of virtual addresses from 0xC0000000 through 0xFFFFFFFF (3 to 4
gigabytes) known as the system arena. 

On computers with large amounts of RAM, the maximum cache size can be
large enough that Vcache consumes all of the addresses in the system
arena, leaving no virtual memory addresses available for other
functions such as opening an MS-DOS prompt (creating a new virtual
machine). 



WORKAROUND
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods: 

Use the MaxFileCache setting in the System.ini file to reduce the
maximum amount of memory that Vcache uses to 512 megabytes (524,288
KB) or less. 

For additional information about how to use the MaxFileCache setting,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base: "


"MORE INFORMATION
Vcache is limited internally to a maximum cache size of 800 MB. 

This problem may occur more readily with Advanced Graphics Port (AGP)
video adapters because the AGP aperture is also mapped to addresses in
the system arena. For example, if Vcache is using a maximum cache size
of 800 MB and an AGP video adapter has a 128-MB aperture mapped, there
is very little address space remaining for the other system code and
data that must occupy this range of virtual addresses. "

Etc.

So actually this is only something which MIGHT happen.
