Umm.  Do range items have a unit specified?  Is there any reason to believe
that a "range: 50" item is 50 feet rather than 50 microns or 50 furlongs?

My proposal that these units are nanometers was meant to show that distance is
purely a relative measure.  There is no golden international meter in a box
somewhere that Norranthians can use to compare in-game distances with
real-world distances (nor to take any of the other "standard" real-world
measurements, like speed of light in a vacuum or wavelengths of certain light
emissions. 

The "real" unit for these measures are "EQ distance units".  Much like item
weight is measured in "EQ encumbrance units".

You're not convinced that weapon range is universal in terms of coordinate
units?  That would surprise me.  I have tested (years ago) a number of
old-world and velious zones for running speed, and I can report that
unbuffed L1 run speed seems to be constant (measured in EQ coordinate units
per real-life second) regardless of zone or race.
