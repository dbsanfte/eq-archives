	I'm rebuilding it as I post this, seems Magelo changed their system
dramatically.

	I deal around 55 DPS in melee solo, and 70-80 DPS in melee buffed, both
counting procs and sustainable casting.  I get around 90 DPS with archery on
an engaged target ASSUMING FUCKWITTED MORONS STOP WALKING IN FRONT OF
ME...sorry....  I've only had one opportunity to use Trueshot SINCE THE ONLY
THING I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO SINCE MAKING HUNTER IS TANK...sorry...and that was
on the Junk Beast (level 60 critter in Innovation).  I made 120 DPS on it
during Trueshot COUNTING THE 20-30 SECONDS I COULDN'T HIT IT BECAUSE PEOPLE
MOVED IN FRONT OF ME FOR NO REASON...sorry...99 DPS for the entire archery
run.  My bow at the time was a Rushing Wind Longbow; I've changed to a
Nightmarewood for the extra DEX (and bought a Bracelet of Quickness to boot).

	Watch out for short fights.  You hit a few big shots and the parser thinks
you did 300 DPS -- which, technically, you did.  For like 2 seconds. :-)
