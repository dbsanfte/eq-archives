That means that you can only have one of the item.  Why exactly
they call this "lore" I don't know.  But at any rate, if you
already have one on you or in your bags, or in your bank account,
then when you try to loot another or someone tries to give you
another or heck, I don't know of any offhand, but if there's a
trade skill item you could make and you make a second one, the
game won't let you have it.

One way around this is to make up "mule" characters on the same
account (or on other accounts) and give the duplicates to them. 
Another is simply to put the duplicate item in the shared bank
account slots... which means on one account on one server you
could have 9 of the same lore item, one on each character plus
one in the bank slot.  I can't offhand think of any reason you'd
really want to do that, but there it is.

Well, first off you almost always have to use the word in a
sentence, usually a question.  Simplest thing to try is to put
the word What in front of the word or phrase you are trying to
get a response to.  "What training?"  As opposed to the valley
girl "training?"  Too, you may have to actually read what they
say, some will tell you a word that some other NPC will respond
to, like "tell Jimmy the Hand that [John Chester] sent you"; you
can ask John "what john chester" all you like but he's said his
piece.  And you could talk to Jimmy the Hand all day and he'll
never give you a response that says "by the way you might want to
hear what [John Chester] has to say" or anything like that to
tell you what to say, instead you find out what Jimmy's trigger
phrase is by talking to John.  Worse, you may actually have to
parse things for yourself a bit, the trigger phrase for Jimmy
might not be "what John Chester" but rather "John Chester sent
me", even though those exact words weren't in the brackets.

Worse still, some quests are bugged and you might have to say
"John Cester sent me" or something even crazier than that,
misspelled triggers and so on really make a mockery of the quest
process.  At one point a couple years ago SOE said that literally
50% of the quests in the game had never been completed... I'd
blame them rather than the player pool, as a significant portion
of the several hundred thousand players have probably tried just
about every quest out there, only to find many of them simply
don't work properly.

The map tool is really a cartography tool, and you can make your
own maps.  The maps I've downloaded dont' make use of the layers,
but I can, for example, put my own notes on layer 2 for my
cleric, and different notes on layer 3 for my bard.  I don't,
mind you, but I could.
