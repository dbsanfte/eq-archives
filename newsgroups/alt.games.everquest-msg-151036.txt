Apparently yes it is.
EQ is visualling freezing but still running.
Alt Tab out and EQ is not listed as an NR process, it still runs.
Strange how normally when you alt-tab from EQ it crashes the process.
The problem tho is hit / <enter> and you will see the Bazaar half empty (200
or less players) as everyone else noticed the same thing and gave up.

CF
Still trying to get my head around the fact that a zone with 200 players can
be considered half empty.
