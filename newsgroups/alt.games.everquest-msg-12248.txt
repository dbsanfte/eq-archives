Actually, a quick check on eqtraders (which I couldn't get through to before
for some reason) reveals that some of the cultural armour (reinforced) does
indeed trivial at a higher level than Wu's, so it might be a good idea to
skill up on that first if you can (i.e. you're a halfing or wood-elf, maybe
an erudite).
