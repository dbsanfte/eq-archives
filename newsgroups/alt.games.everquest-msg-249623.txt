That doesn�t address the problem though. The Ubers are worried about
GoD content, I couldn't care less. I'm worried about stuff that's been
around for years and hasn't been fixed. Mobs under the ground. Horse
bugs. Tradeskilling nightmares. Broken Lowbie quests. Most of this the
Ubers couldn�t care less about. They are already past that. They only
thing they worry about outside of the new high end content is where
the best place to PL their new alt is at.

I don't want new Uber content, I want more content available to all.
I've played EQ for 2 1/2 years off and on. Until this latest character
I have never gotten one beyond about 25th level. I came back to EQ
after 2 years away, and now it's insanely easy to level up to 50. It's
like Sony is saying "We know we haven't added much content in the last
two years that is available to levels 1 to 50, so we are making it
easier to blow through those levels so you don't have time to see
through the thin spots."

I think EQ's better moments were the inclusion of The Warrens,
StoneBrunt, Jagged Pine, and to a lesser extent LoY.

The problem is that there is the opinion of many EQ players that the
only fun stuff to do is in the high end and that the low and medium
stuff is just filler that you pass through as quickly as possible to
get to the high end. Which is why the Broken Rock stuff isn't as
popular as it should have been. (Though the inclusion of a PoK book
near the Light House would make it easier for me to convince people to
come there.)

I can't put in the hours that a raiding guild expects. Sure I play EQ
a lot, but it's only a few hours on most days (well after prime time)
and a big chunk on Sunday and Monday, but EQ just isn't important
enough to change my schedule at work (and all the hassle that entails)
just so I can have a big chunk of time on Friday and Saturday. I will
never See most GoD content, no matter what my equipment is like (So
I'm not even going to buy it), I won't likely ever even see the gods
of the PoP, (though I made it the RP story of my character to kill
Bertoxx). I'm in a family type guild that is hoping to raid some of
the old world, velious, and luclin content if we can field two full
groups or more, but everything else is out of reach, and will always
be unless I join a raiding guild.

What can SoE do for me? I'll tell you what SoE can do to make me stick
with EQ after WoW comes out, or after I get burnt out again on the
Grind. They can fix the bugs and quests that have been around for
years. They can add new zones to the old world and retune old zones.
They can add more quests to the low and mid levels, that actually
result in something useful. They can add quests that don't require the
killing of hundreds of mobs to get something useful. Even if it's
something with limited charges. I like the possibilities that the new
engine offers, fix it, and then use it to spiff up the old world. Make
tradeskilling more profitable to do, I should be able to sell the
items I make for more than the cost of materials. Failures I can deal
with, but the stuff I actually succeed at making should sell back for
more than it cost to make them. Honestly there are faster ways to make
money in EQ than a few silver profit off of trade skills. They can run
more GM events that can be participated in by mid-level characters. I
won't ask for 1 GM to every 6 players, because I know that is not
possible, but NWN is a very fun game just for that reason, but some
more GMs in EQ, so that they can spend their time not just answering
petitions, but actually providing dynamic content for the players.

One more thing, take the route of one of your competition (the only
good thing about that game) and add Consigners so people don't have to
leave their characters logged in to sell stuff, and don't just add
them to the Bazaar, put them in every city, so newbies can use them to
sell their bone chips and such.

There is a reason that a game like PnP D&D is still around and popular
after all these years, (and to a lesser extent NWN) and that's because
of content. Every week is something new. The EQ world is too static.
Removing old stuff will likely cause people to scream, but I don't see
a problem with modifying the world. I've killed 600 Freeport Militia,
and the damn Pallys in North Freeport still haven't made any head way.
WoW seems to have taken the right path and made a lot of content (not
the largest world, square footage wise perhaps, but a lot of things to
do) it's not likely to be (as someone else pointed out) the panacea
everyone is looking for, but it's a step in the right direction.

I'm starting to sound a little more sour, because I've gotten to the
point where things have become just a grind again. EQ is ultimately
pointless but the new content covers that up. Unfortunately I am
starting to run out of content.
