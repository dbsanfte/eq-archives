Out of curiousity, (and maybe the two of you already covered this) given
Verant's stated position on hacked accounts, what's to stop him from
calling up SOE's customer service and saying he changed his password and
forgot what it is so "change it back to sd843jf923emn please?"

At that point, he's got your money, and has the account back which he
can sell again, yes?  VI won't back you up and give you the account if
you complain, they'll just cancel it, and he's still got your money. And
as you noted yourself, are you really going to go through the expense to
get an attorney to chase this case down? (likely a couple attornies if
he's not living in the same state.) I would think scam sellers are
counting on that factor heavily.

Not saying you didn't get lucky and get a "legitimate" *cough* e-bayer
and everything's fine, but it makes one wonder if you're really out of
the woods yet.
