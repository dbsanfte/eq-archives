Well, as EQ2 won't be out until Monday, your only choice tomorrow will be
CoH.

I'm running the EQ2 Beta with a GeForce TI4200.  Occasional graphics
glitches, but otherwise not bad.  Currently I'm running without incidental
flora or shadows, but when it goes live I'll be turning those back on.  I
wasn't having serious problems with them.

Try "on the gripping hand", reference to Moties from Niven's "The Mote in
God's Eye".

Supposedly EQ2 is designed to allow soloing all the way to 50.  Keep in mind
that the current max is 50 but that the *stated* eventual level max is 200.
