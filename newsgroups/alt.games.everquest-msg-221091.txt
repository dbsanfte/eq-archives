I used to be in a guild where everyone spoke dragon, and the
officers spoke elder dragon, we wouldn't teach it to anyone else,
and then we'd use the languages to communicate semi-privately. 
Back then there were no chat channels or raid channels, so if you
had a raid you had to talk in guild or in ooc/shout/auction.  Now
we surely -could- have used guild, but instead we'd use the shout
channel but all be chattering away in dragon unless we had a
guest, even then we'd use dragon to make snide comments about him
or her.  The officers, meantime, would hold officer conferences
in elder dragon again right out in public.

We knew that others could make the effort to learn the language
and so eavesdrop on us, but that was part of the fun.  Hang out
with us long enough you'd eventually learn on your own, too.

And we didn't tell applicants this, but we'd never accept one
that didn't make the effort to learn dragon... mostly someone in
the guild that liked them would teach them, sort of like having a
sponsor, but one willing to spam you with dragon for an hour, a
certain level of commitment required.

I think if I hadn't "quit the game" and sold that account I'd
probably still be in that guild, some things are better than the
pursuit of power; that guild had some personality to it.
