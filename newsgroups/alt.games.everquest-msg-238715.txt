I can not figure out how to do this!
I tried keying in the conversation box while standing infront of a
guildmaster saying I need armor. but that did not work. I tried keying
it in usign the [] keyes on the keyboard no go. Please help, the only
thing I can figure out how to do is train, they don't respond to
anything else.
