Hmm.  Doesn't seem the same to me as what my druid can get away with.  After
a good kite/quad-kite I'm still at full health - that's no lag and I don't
get bumped (too much hehe).  Wouldn't the mob get rounds in on you even for
the brief time you came in for a swing (as a warrior)??  Seems like it
*might* decrease the net damage to you over the battle a bit.  The one thing
about kiting for my druid anyways, it reduces downtime if done properly - I
take next to no damage really (none that a good regen can't take care of)
and med'n when at a distance even snare/nuking leaves you pretty well off
mana-wise too.

I think if I saw someone doing this with a warrior I'd have to sit down for
awhile and enjoy it to be sure.
