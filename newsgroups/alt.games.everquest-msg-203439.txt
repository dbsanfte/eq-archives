Wow, way to take a post that stated 3 times that I wasn't trying to complain
or start a flame war and start one anyway.  I personally don't see the
recent patch as a "nerf to soloing."  Was more referring to the fact that
the makers of the game and their "vision" seem to want to discourage
soloing.

Anyway, not gonna try and continue the flame war, just thought I'd clarify
since my post seemed to be misunderstood.
