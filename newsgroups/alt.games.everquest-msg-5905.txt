It all depends on what is your definition of "good caster."

Wizards are great casters and certainly have their uses, what with the
evac spells and very high powered direct damage. Enchanters are vital to
any well-organized group, are important for many trade skills (and are
the only ones who can realistically take up jewelry making) but are one
of the physically weakest classes in the game. Mages and necros have a
built in tank and are (IMO) the two best "all around" casters and decent
solo players, with mages having an emphasis on conjuration and necros
able to do decent damage. Clerics are healers extraordinaire and are
always in demand for a group. Shamans are also in high demand because of
their ability to buff, they make good back up healers and can assist
melee. Druids are great for outdoor groups, are the near ideal puller
with harmony, sow and damage over time spells, have some useful buffs and
can group teleport.

What kind of player are you? Do you want to just solo, just group, or be
able to do both? Are you content with a support role in combat, or do you
want to be active in bringing down the mob? Are you good at paying
attention and targeting a changing situation or would you rather be able
to focus on one thing at a time? These are the things that will determine
the kind of caster for you.
