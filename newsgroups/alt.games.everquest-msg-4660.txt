This is a bug with the Green Zombie that spawns along the river 
near where the alligators are (this is on the path most commonly 
followed between CZ and Oggok).  The GZ will aggro on players, 
and its hate list gets transferred onto the Ogre Guards if they 
see it after you aggro it.  This will appear especially 
mysterious if you are of high enough level for the GZ to not be 
able to hit you, and you don't notice it's on your tail as you 
run to the Oggok entrance guards.

I suspect that this is an unwanted effect from keeping the guards 
from killing the zombie.
