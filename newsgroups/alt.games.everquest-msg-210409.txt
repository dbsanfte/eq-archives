Its not a question of obsessing, though, just of not selling them to vendors;
you can get about 14 sp for a stack from a vendor or 20pp for a stack off
players.  Since killing skellies or spiderlings is as easy as anything else in
most newbie zones, making a point of going after them and saving the procedes
to sell will easily double your income.  Plus, of course, your most likely
source for staffs (some of the highest resale value weapons dropped on newb
mobs) are skellies anyway.

I made a couple hundred PP recently while killing stuff in Shadeweaver by
collecting payala fruits while I hunted, selling them in stacks of 20 for
20pp.  Its amazing what trade skillers will be happy to pay for, as long as you
have it in quantity.
