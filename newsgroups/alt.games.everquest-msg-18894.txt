It took me about 350-400 frost giant kills to get to dubious with CoV.

I'm guessing somewhat, but I recall that Verant said that killing a mob gave
a greater negative faction hit than a positive one (maybe 2 or 3 times, but
who knows), so I'd say that killing another 100 or less giants would
probably do the trick.

Also note that the faction hits from the giants deep in Kael (the ones that
give Tormax hits) are supposed to be much more pronounced, so you might want
to go on a few Kael raids.
