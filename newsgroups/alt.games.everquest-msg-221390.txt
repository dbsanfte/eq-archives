Maybe you have the begging skill confused with the begging of players for
items.

Begging (using the skill) off NPC's is fine, they will attack you
occasionally but nothing wrong with doing it.

Begging from players is bad as they have earnt there items, and generally
feel that noobs should earn there own.

A true noob will often be helped out, be it with buffs, items, a few plat
etc, but if they ask for any of these (mainly items / plat), they will
generally be ridiculed / ignored etc.
