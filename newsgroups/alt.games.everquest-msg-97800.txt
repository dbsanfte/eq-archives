And maximum (non-critical, I guess) damage is?

I believe that equates to ((dmg *2) + bonus), correct?
For a 28 max damage for the weapon in question?  And
it also shifts the "sweet spot," correct?

It's my understanding that a sword, for instance, goes up
in damage (as evidenced by the damage bonus) as the
weilder levels.  A 60 warlord is going to do a lot more
damage with the same weapons as a 30 warrior, for instance,
due -only- to the damage bonus.  (Ignoring for the discussion
the various Discs, etc.)

(No idea here;  I've never played a melee up to levels
where the damage caps are off and bonus was an issue.)
