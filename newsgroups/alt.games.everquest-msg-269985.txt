Well, for the tier 2 stuff, you currently can do it all on one character 
as far as I know.  You can learn the level 10 recipes for other 
tradeskill archetypes, which is what is required to make the 
subcomponents that I have had a need for so far.  In particular, I am a 
Scholar, and I have learned the level 10 recipes for making my own paper 
and quills so that I can make the tier 2 spells and runes.  I am 
expecting that this will not hold true for tier 3 however, and am 
expecting eventually that you will need someone in each of the sub 
classes in order to actually make the high end stuff, but, I don't know 
yet.
