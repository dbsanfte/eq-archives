So, some questions for you, chorkie. Not trying to trip you up or anything,
just figure out where you're coming from.

Did anyone ever suggest that the necro twitch the (frequently OOM) druid?
Did he ever do so? It seems odd that the druid was the one running low on
mana, but it's you complaining that you weren't being twitched. Just
curious.

Other than announcing that he was OOM, did the druid complain about anything?
Did he, for example, claim you were wasting mana on CH when the warrior
was nearly topped on on hps? Did he seem happy with the way the ldon was
going? Was he whining about what his role? Or how well the adventure was
going? Or how other players weren't living up to his expectations?

In many ways, having a "selfish" necromancer on the team is just like
having a "selfless" wizard around. They're good for dps, minor crowd
control, and (for whatever reason) don't buff anyone. What, if anything,
would you have done differently in the ldon if you'd had a wizard instead
of a necro? Even a selfless wizard would not have helped you recover from
the wipe+rez+temp+ch any faster than a selfish necro, so you'd probably
have still failed due to running out of time. How would you feel about the
failure then?
