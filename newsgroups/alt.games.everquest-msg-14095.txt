Greetings fellow travellers

I have a question concerning Dual Wield skill - my warrior (Dwarf) just hit
13, and had enough points to put 3 into Dual Wield to get it going (also put
2 into piercing to start it off, because I had found a Great Snake Fang or
similar name).
Now if I have my whip (1 handed slashing was maxed for lvl 12) in my primary
hand, and the Fang in my secondary, will Dual Wield get used automatically
and start to go up?

Reason I ask is because I have just tried it, and all that happens is my
primary hits all the time, no notes of text saying the secondary does.  I
swapped the piercing over to my primary hand, and that hit fine, but my
slashing in secondary hand didn't.
I only played for 15 mins or so actual fighting time (got more time later)
but had hoped to see Dual Wield go up or go off at least once.

How long does it take for it to get going/start increasing?  I realise that
the issue is probably with the fact I only have a few points in D/W and need
to wait for it to increase, but I had hoped to have seen it go off at least
once (like seeing me hit for slash, followed by pierce... or does it not
work like that?).

Thanks for any help

Gorphunk
