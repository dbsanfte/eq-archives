Thank you. Re-reading my post, I may not have been entirely clear
(thanks for noticing, Bizbee) but you all got the gist of it spot on.

Many of the comments expressed here were almost verbatim points I made
in the debate, which lasted all day on our message board.

I'm pretty sure none of my guildies read AGE as diligently as I do,
but I linked them to this thread with its unanimous consent that this
kind of behavior is inexcusable.

I was burned up on this all day long, and once again thank you all for
your insights.
