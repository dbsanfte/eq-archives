<<<<<<<1. Groups with KEI do not need back-up healers/nukers, etc. This makes
it harder for non-KEI'd players to find groups. (The same applies to
mega-buffs on melees)>>>>>>>>>>

This is a nonsense point.  Why would you want to group with players that won't
take non-KEI'd players in there group if you don't like KEI to begin with.  You
wouldn't.  So having KEI in the game saves you time by helping you to find
friends who have a similar playing style to yours and should therefore be kept
in the game.  Nice try, but it really doesn't make any sense.

<<<<<<<2. Players with KEI do not need to group. This makes it harder for
non-KEi'd players (especially melee classes) to find groups.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

You're basically trying to make the same point all over again here.  It's
getting a little weaker now that you're trying it twice.  See above remarks.

<<<<<<<<<3. Groups are MUCH more likely to take a caster with KEI over one
without. Go to any popular zone prior to the patch and you would see
"/shout LevelXX <Caster> w/KEI LFG">>>>>>>

Uh oh.  Weve got 3 numbers here but they all attenot to make the same point
which I rather easily destroyed the first time you made it.

<<<<<<<<<In all cases players that do not use KEI or do not benefit from it (eg
melee classes) are affected negatively. The above are just a couple of
examples with regards to how it adversly affected gameplay. I am sure
you will discount them, and continue to spout off that no one has
given you an answer to your question. >>>>

I appreciate you trying to answer the question sir, as some of the weasels on
this board will not but as you can see your points do not hold water.  Got any
others?  All I said before was that this doofus Crash hadn't answered my
question.  A straggler here and there has popped in but all have had the same
weak point you tried to make above.  Although you're the first to attempt to
make it three times.
