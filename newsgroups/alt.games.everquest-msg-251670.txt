But it gives you nothing unless you have been flagged in trials, which is
not easy if you are soloing. You really have to be in a decent guild for
that. The LDON charms don't require guilds and are decent enough. The LoY
charms might be ok if you are grouping in that zone anyway, as a side
benefit, but I never got one. The LoY bag charm is just bizarre, and the one
that gives you a bonus if you are the only person (or close to it) in the
zone is funky, and the one that goes up as you group with people of the same
class or race (can't recall) might be good on FV but I never saw the point
otherwise.
