Well I have to tell you I did re-install Everquest (after a Hefty
download and update) and re-activated my account.

- Liked the mercenaries, makes soloing certain tasks that much easier
(are we able to use multiple mercs? Have not seen an FAQ on this).
- Logged into AB and it seemed traffic was a little slower than what
it used to be for a Sunday but not too bad either (and not nearly as
slow as I remembered).
- I logged into the 51/50 server and this seems far more active, may
be better way to start that Necro I wanted :).
- Unbelievably some of my old friends on AB started tagging me right
away (thought they would all be gone by now), and sill saw most of the
old groups still being fairly active.

All in all a good experience so I think for now, I will continue to
play EQ (even if more limitedly so - currently looking to join a
Family Friendly Guild on AB) and maybe I can progress my character a
bit further :).
