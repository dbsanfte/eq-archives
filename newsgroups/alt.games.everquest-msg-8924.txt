*sigh*  But it's not your job to make it harder for the enchanter to mez the
critter by beating on it.  Just let the healer keep them alive until the mez
goes off.

Any enchanter level 20+ should be able to stun/stun/mez with VERY few
problems.  Are you stuck with a high elf enchanter?

And it never will be with you hitting it.

You're a mind reader?  What happens when you get more than one of the same
name?  Happens all the time.

Once folks are /assisting you, DON'T change targets.  So what if the
enchanter mezzed the one you were about to beat on and everyone had already
targetted it through you?  Big deal, the enchanter can just go mez the other
one.  That also happens all the time.  Enchanters are all about
adaptability.  It's not the warrior's job to think, just to kill.

Then by erroneously "saving" the enchanter you're causing other non-warrior
tanks to take damage.  You can't win, huh?

No, you speculated that it's more mana efficient to lessen an enchanter's
chance of doing their job by beating on the things he's trying to mez.  And
I pointed out that it's MUCH more mana efficient for you to do your job and
let the enchanter and cleric do theirs.  I was NOT speculating that having
an enchanter is important...obviously it is.

I think you totally underestimate the power of chain-casting AE stun (level
20+).

If an enchanter is being beat on, the cleric may have to heal a couple times
until the critter is more pissed at the cleric.  As soon as THAT happens,
the critter is asleep (unless, of course, you're trying to pull it off the
cleric, which totally negates one of the enchanter's primary jobs).

High elf?  Just like any other class, there's plenty of bad enchanters.
Those where you just want to say "oh, speed me, clarity her and just sit
down and get out of the way."

It's the enchanter's job to keep the casters alive.  You and your tank
buddies just beat on something 'til it dies...leave the thinking to the
finger wigglers.  We'll letcha know what we want you to do when you're done
being manly men with one critter.   We wouldn't want the fleas to get hot
feet. ;)
