Several spells are one level for one class and a different level for another.
If you get a spell that is level 61 for you, but level 40 for another class,
then that spell is probably available on a vendor or dropped in another
expansion.  Either way, you are going to be sorely dissapointed if you get a
"one every couple hours" drop off a level 60 mob, and it turns out to be
somethign you could have purchased in five minutes work for under a hundred pp.

A friend of mine posted a root spell he got as his level 62 hand in.. and for
me, its a level 64 spell.  I live in fear of the day I hand in a spectral
parchment (63/64 spell bait) and get that lame piece of garbage.  Even if its
not lame or garbage, the fact that another class will be able to get it for the
far easier to come by Ethereal parchment is going to piss me off.
