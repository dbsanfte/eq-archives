while in ssra the other day i was doin the arcanists and things and the =
snake like shissar in ssra, they are massive, jus before we entered the =
tube there is a small hallway, door on the far right hand side after the =
entrance. (we were making our way to comm2 at this point). in this small =
L shaped corridor we had a great monk singling the pulls and we were =
doing well, but i noticed that i could stand against the back of the =
wall, while the mob was near the door, all the time, still hitting the =
mob and not be prone to riposits and the alike, while our tank happily =
beat upon the fucker until it was dead. Im using a Great Lance of Grief, =
now this fucker is BIG and i mean MASSIVE. Remember those old films =
about camelot, its a fuckin joustin lance, i hit for circa 250-300 with =
maxx strength and im finding it fun until i can get my remaining VT =
shards and get some of that stuff. but all in all, i dont think it has =
anything to do with the size of your weapon, meerly the size of the mob.
