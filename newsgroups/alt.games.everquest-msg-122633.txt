Greetings.

I'm looking to begin baking my own food, and although the recipes at eqtraders.com
are very good, they don't show the weights of each stack.
I know there are lightweight foods to be made from looting ingredients from mobs, but
is there a good recipe that doesn't require ingredients found as loot? Is there a
merchant that sells all the ingredients to bake light food in say, Bazaar or
Shadowhaven?
I guess I'm looking for recipes/locations to make food that has the following
criteria: Lightweight, meal size or better, minimal running around, inexpensive and
increasing in baking skills, in that order.
Not too much to ask for is it? :)

Thanks in advance.
