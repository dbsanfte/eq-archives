Stupid dealing and trades are my specialty,  I was in the Freeport bank
cashing in money when this guy starts sending me tells to come to the bank
for some cool stuff. I take a look at what he has to offer and see some
armor for small warrior.  I spend all of my 31pp and find out I can't equip
any of it. It might be small but no dwarfs!  The guy throws in some free
earrings but no refund!  Now I'm broke and have 3 pieces of armor I can't
use.
Another deal with another character...finally get up 100pp and want some WIS
items for my druid, find and jeweler that is willing to make some gold
(?jasper?) pieces, I meet them at the mage area in Freeport and they tell me
to buy the gems, give the gems to them, they hand me back 3 pieces of
jewelry with +WIS stats and disappear.  Later I take a closer look and they
are all silver.  I paid 103pp for silver veil and 2 silver rings. Most web
sites say gold is worth that much. Just didn't pay attention.
  Stupid life lessons...
