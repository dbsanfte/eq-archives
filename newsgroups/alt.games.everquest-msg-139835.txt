Usually, in a duel, the challenged party has a right to set terms and 
conditions, like, say, choice of weapons.  Usualy, the challenger, if he 
truly desires a duel, is more than happy to agree to them.  His refusal to 
do so might suggest something about the challenger's courage.

Dunno, I didn't hear him crying out for a duel.  You, on the other hand, 
seem to feel a duel is the only form of conflict in which you have a hope 
of success, so it's no suprise you'd insist on it.

}YOU refused and ran away like a little child...

}You are simply too much of a chicken shit to pick it up...

By my scorecard, he's picked it up and smacked you with it a couple times.  
Now, if you don't agree to his terms, you're welcome to suggest a 
compromise.  I do think his asking you to pay the plane fare is entirely 
reasonable under the circumstances.  I suggest you choose seconds.  
Luckily for Twohead, he comes with one built-in. :)
