It's always been annoying to root and rot as a barbarian shaman.  Pull with
Mal line, root, DoT, root (DoT has DD component, and often breaks root), 2nd
DoT, root again, move away, med, reapply root and DoTs as needed.  This
change won't remove that annoyance entirely, but the DoTs will be more
effective, and it will allow me to DoT kite in appropriate zones.
