There can be parts of the object that can exist client-side. When they
do, they usually end up custom-modded. The custom links people have
used lately come to mind.

The item does.. your argument is that a non-critical part of an item,
say the graphic that it uses may exist on the client-side in order to
give the user more power in customizing their particular interface.
And while that is a valid argument.. the root object that controls it
still exists on the server-side. An object can exist on server and
receive customized properties of it from the client-side. But any more
than you telling me to paint the BoC hilt blue, this does not generate
a new copy of that object, and if you transfer that item to someone
else, it will typically revert to its default color unless its a
permanant change supported by the game and server.

And by that philosophy, you don't own your house either. The sale of
your house, at least in America, is governed by the laws of your
particular state and federal governments. They have codes that must be
lived up to, rules on how you can transfer that item, can assess taxes
on the sale, and can in-fact take it from you if they so desire
through emminent domain laws. And really, its only yours because you
have a military able to defend that land from all enemies, foreign and
domestic. In other countries, its even more strict, but guaranteed the
governing bodies hold contractual restrictions over the sale and
transfer of every house, apartment, office building, etc that occupy
part of their sovereign territory.

Personally, if EQ wants to make an EULA enforcement policing agency to
oversee the 'proper' transfer of items.. then they should do so, not
rely on taxpayers and their governments to do it for them.

Bad analogy. Apples and oranges. In the first, you lease out time with
the object and have it in your possession. You could drive it off a
cliff, into the wall, and the object changes. In the second you simply
pay for access to a world.. and a BoC is one of the objects that you
can earn through playing in that world.

Sony would need to create a policing entity in the game that oversees
transactions. If they did, then they could. But claiming poverty and
screaming for state and federal governments to do, what you are
inferring Sony is incapable of doing, is perverted to say the least,
especially when they have hundreds of thousands of people paying them
$12.99/month. They can either get off their dead ass and police
themselves and their beloved EULA or stfu.

They've chosen to stfu.
