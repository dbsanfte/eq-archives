SoW is the hardest thing to time.  As a player of both a cleric and a
druid I can use myself to time the HP buffs but for SoW I gave up and
got a timer.  I set it for 34 minutes so I have a two minute warning
when SoW goes.  If you are concerned about this I suggest you do the
same.  

The reason SoW is so hard to time is higher level people are always
casting over SoW!  This is a major pain for me as a druid.  With a
higher level SoW caster in the group I have to keep track of who SoWed
who (and when) and it changes every time they cast throughout the play
session.  At one point last night I would have needed 5 timers to keep
track of all the SoWs.  It's a nightmare!  

Very important in Unrest:  If you ask for SoW and a group member
refuses, leave the group IMMEDIATELY.  I've been killed on purpose there
before by people who wanted fewer members in the group, so they picked
two to not SoW, then pulled a train.
