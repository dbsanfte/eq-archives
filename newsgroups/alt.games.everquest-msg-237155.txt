...which is _also_ a 9 HP/tick regen, by the way, plus we can cast Chloro,
and we have high natural regen to start with (which varies by race -- iksar
BST regen with the buffage is almost silly).

From my observation and experience, beastlords are the strongest overall
class, considering all different EQ gaming situations (low and mid and high
levels, soloing and exp grouping and adv grouping and raiding). I think for
just about all of those purposes you can identify at least one class that's
even stronger, and for raiding there are a number of more-powerful classes,
but....looking across the board at all the different parts of the EQ playing
experience from 1 through 65, beasts are really quite something.

I have a RL friend who plays on my server, he's the SOB that got me hooked
on Evercrack in fact, a 3-boxer who has leveled a druid, cleric and warrior
to 60 or higher plus a wizzie maybe half that, played around with other
classes along the way....he started a kitty beastlord 6 months ago that is
now lvl65 with 100 AA's and he's hooked. The other day we were kicking
around starting newbie characters on Morden Rasp and he surprised me by
stating that he'd start a fresh beastlord. Said the beast has just been too
good from start to finish to ever bother with another class.

Beastlords were added to the game with a few particular disadvantages
intended to balance their strengths: high food/water consumption, no
self-transport ability (no ports or gate or bind), and no crowd control
ability (we never get any root or snare or mez). Turns out that the first
has no impact in practice since we do get summon food/water; the second has
been rendered largely moot by PoK stones plus the LDoN-camp magi; and our
warder's taunting ability lets us mitigate the third with some practice and
skill (pet-mezzing).

When LDON rolled out, a lot of players seemed surprised to learn that BSTs
could slow and haste. Maybe my server hadn't had many active BSTs, I dunno.
Anyway nowadays I get invites anytime.

Yes. Its not that beastlords are the very best at one thing, rather they
have uniquely strong versatility across all types of EQ play.

That hasn't been my experience particularly, though I am not equipped to
elemental-planes capability. But LDoN-point equipment has really reduced the
plat cost to be equipped pretty well, plus as a great solo class we can farm
plat fast and easy in Dulak or Rathe.
