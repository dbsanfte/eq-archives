Critters always give the same experience, or no xp at all.

MAKING UP WILD NUMBERS, here's what I mean.

Level 40.  You need 1000 total experience points to get to level 41.  You
kill a level 40 critter and get 50 experience points!  Twenty more of them
and you ding.

Level 50.  You need 10,000 total experience points to get to level 51.  You
kill a level 40 critter and get 50 experience points!  Two hundred more and
you ding!

Absolutely nothing has changed regarding experience on a critter when they
added the new con color.  Now you can tell the total wastes of time (very
green) from the ALMOST total waste of time (xp-giving greens).
