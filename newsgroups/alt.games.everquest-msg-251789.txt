Yes im really concerned about a few brainac wannabees.
A thread like this one is a real good filter for the brainac wannabees in a
newsgroup.  Thanks for identifying yourselves.  Im sure you folks think you
comprise most of the newsgroup.  Ya that makes sense.  Please keep posting
your soooo enlightening me.  Every time you post you speak volumes.

Its interesting what people use so harshly on others is what they are afraid
of themselves.  They reach back into their minds and hearts to find the
worse thing they can think of and blast you with it.  Are arrogant scorning
and character assinations what your greatest fears are?  Let me help you out
with that dude.  You see when someone assinates your character others
silently look on and view that person as a real dick.  And when you bravely
face it others look on and view you as a hero.  At least to some degree.
Does that help you?  I hope so!

Cheers
John Stewart
