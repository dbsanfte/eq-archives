As mentioned, my Monk earlier made the awful mistake of killing an NPC
monk outside Qeynos. My faction with the clan dropped to "Dubious", but
with a lot of gnoll killing I got it back up to "indifferent" and was
able to train again. There is a lowbie quest (white scarf/headband )
that I wanted to do, but couldn't.  A few levels later, I've now got my
faction back up to "amiable" and even did that Tomers rescue quest that
started all this mess in the first place.
  So I went and got the scalps for the white scarf quest, turned them in
to the master at the clan house (who also conned "amiable") and was
told, "Thank you, but I think we need to save that task for a more
trusted member."
  My question is, just how high will I have to raise my faction with my
clan in order to do this quest, and how many freaking thousands of
gnolls will I have to whack to do so?
Thanks.
