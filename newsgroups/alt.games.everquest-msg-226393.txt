Actually, for me, I think thats it exactly.

I enjoy movies, but I have absolutely no interest in collecting action
figures.  Making the movie only available through purchase of a set of
action figures (which brings the price to well above the standard for a
movie)  is what I would consider to be a sleezy marketing tactic.

Is it illegal, as was suggested earlier in this thread?  Not at all.   But
it's unlikely to win SoE very many points with me.
