Ah, okay, you *do* have to cross Kael; but you don't need good giant faction to
do it. Believe me, there is no one the giants hate more than my druid; she's at
the "your faction standing can't get any worse" point with them, and she has
made the run safely any number of times. In fact, I've never died in Kael.

There are no mobs that see invis on the direct path through to Wakening Lands.
Get a guide the first time through though; there are giants that see invis in
there if you stray off the beaten path. Most people just use invis/sow and run
it. I have seen an enterprising druid/mage pair on my server (The Nameless)
offering taxi rides through as well. The mage sits on the WL side and the druid
binds on EW side and has invite power. For a fee, the druid gates to EW zone,
invites you into group and the mage casts CoH to bring you through. I'm sure
they made quite a bit of cash at it. /grin

Once you get to WL, pick up a tooth from the ring and from then on, you only
need to get a port to get past Kael, although frankly running it may still be
safer since there is a dragon that makes his home in the WL ring. He usually
doesn't live long on The Nameless; but if you port in while he's still up,
expect to be die unless your CoV faction is good.

From WL, you go to Skyshrine and get a key to Cobalt Scar off Ziglark
Whisperwing; you will take a dragon faction hit for killing him unfortunately,
unless you can get someone else to do the deed for you. Go invis through
Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar, and pick up the tooth from that ring too. Then you
have a direct port to CS, although it's also a dangerous landing if you are KoS
to the dragons. If you aren't KoS to the dragons, the wyverns and drakes will
not attack you.

I'm not 100% sure about this; but I don't think you can have good faction with
giants, dwarves, and dragons all three. If there's a way to do it though, I'd
like to know. I can say that the tar goos in the coldain city do sometimes drop
coldain heads which can be turned in for giant faction without hurting your
dwarf faction; but I have no idea how many of them it would take to do the
trick. . .
