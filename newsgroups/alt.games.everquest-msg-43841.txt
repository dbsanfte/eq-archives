You would think so much differently if you were the CEO and making this
equation...

$10 a month
 x
half a million subscribers a month.

you have the room to be honest... we dont care what the CEO says... if one
enjoys something in their life, why flame them?

Now if you neglect stuff because of a game... that's your own fault... not
theirs.
