My guess is that your password is on the top 100 list of passwords (top 5
used to be love, sex, password, birthdate, the first name of
boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse).  What about the account name?  Character name?
If so, you were ripe to be hacked.  Best passwords are random number/letter
combinations.  Problem is, you usually need to write them down and keep them
nearby to remember them.
