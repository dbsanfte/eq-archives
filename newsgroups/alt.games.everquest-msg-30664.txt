I can at least answer that one for you. Back in my teen days when I
started working on HH faction in the orc groups in the pass, I was bound
for a week or so right next to the Kithicorre zone line in the pass. The
entire pass, and the keep, are both bindable for non-casters. (Note: If
this changed in a patch in the last few months I wouldn't know, and I
guess it *might* not be true anymore, but you could definitely do it as
late as the beginning of this summer.)
