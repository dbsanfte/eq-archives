I think you're just being an obnoxious, jealous punk. Care to read what he
said again?

From how it appears, Dufour has not upgraded yet, so he's only asking to
either save money or spend more to get the performance he wants.

It's very possible to have those system specifics and -still- have
difficulties on raids or in Luclin zones. All in all, it is a very valid
question.
