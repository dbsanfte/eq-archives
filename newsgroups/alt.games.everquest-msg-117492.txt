Yes, you can still play your old character. You will notice graphical
changes if you choose to install the memory-eating new textures and/or new
models (better drawn characters/equipment/armor).

You can buy horses (they cost an arm and a leg) by some merchants in a zone
called The Bazaar on Luclin. You have seen none riding them yet, because you
need to install Luclin to "see" horses. Just that you've seen some people
running very fast so far (they are riding invisible-to-you horses).
