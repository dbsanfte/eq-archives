Well...

Couple of points.

I played on Morningthaw, now on Povar.

You will have to get used to not gaining xp from practicing trade skills.
However, skills increase as you use them, they just don't give you xp to
level. You'll need to get used to classes and level-dependant skills. You'll
need to get used to better graphics. And interruptions as you zone. Get used
to limited pack space. I know it sounds like I am bashing EQ, but overall, I
think EQ is the better game.

As for class... easiest? maybe warrior. simplest. Get a weapon, start
pounding. As far as I am concerned, ranged weapons are good for one shot in
EQ, to pull the critter in. Other than that, don't bother.

if you get on Povar, look up the Universal Brotherhood, or look for
Caerwyddh.
