After hitting level 18 with my new druid I moved onto north karana
when blackburrow starting giving little XP.

I started fooling around with charm animal, and it seems not a bad way
to get experience, though quite risky. Even on a successful charm you
never know how long it will remain charmed. Most of the time you get
about ten minutes out of it, but some times you only get 10 seconds !
Nothing like having two dark blue/yellow critters after you and then
your SOW runs out :)

I found charming griffawns was the way to go. They conn dark blue and
rarely resist, and if they do/when they break charm they don't move to
fast so it's fairly easy to outrun them and recharm them. They also do
a truckload of melee damage for their level, they were easily taking
out scythe beetles which were conning yellow to me.

I wonder if this system would work with elephants/mammoths ? I hear
those tusks are worth a fair bit.
