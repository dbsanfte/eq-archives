Rockpyle,

Oh, Rocky!

I used that particular lineup to show how flexible a bard can be, how many
hats we can wear.  In an earlier LDON that day, with a different group (WAR,
SK, SK, CLR, ENC, BRD) my lineup was very different.  CC wasn't my job,
Haste wasn't my job, and the cleric took care of cures for me.  In that
dungeon, I used:

1: Lull
2: Haste/DS song (for the ATK and DS)
3: Overhaste
4: Heal/Manasong
5: Jolt song
6: Snare/Slow
7: Mezz
8: Disease/Poison Cure

9&10 are standard - trap key and incoming key.

Pull was much the same, save that I pull with Jolt song - gets aggro, but
very LOW aggro so it's easy for the warrior or SK to pull the mob off of me.
I dislike pulling with Snare because if I'm breaking a room with 4 or 5 mobs
in it, my Lull might wear off while a snared mob is still crawling out of
the room and I've got an add.  After mob is where it belongs,
haste/haste/snare until slow lands from the chanter, then
haste/haste/heal&manasong.  I let the SKs deal with snares so I could pull
at 40 pct health.  Mezz was mostly in case the chanter died to misfortune or
for interrupting CHs.

As you can see, I seldom have a spot for Amp - oh, I could have dropped 8
for it I guess, but I like being able to take care of traps on myself while
out pulling.  I have a Battle Drummer's Main Gauche (sp) so I've got
percussion focus going for my DSs (my offhand is either a Troubadour's Mace
for brass or a Mighty Dagger for Vengeance).  For me, Amp is mostly used on
raids.
