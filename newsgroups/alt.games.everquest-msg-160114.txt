I've seen leather paddings go for as much as 100p.

Yes, tradeskill supplies are often insanely overpriced, but
there's a reason for it.  Picture, for example, a high-end
tradeskiller trying to fill an order for a 30,000p
Underfoot Plate Breastplate (or even a 3000p Dwarven Plate
BP), who discovers that he is fresh out of leather paddings,
a necessary ingredient.

He'll pay 100p for a Leather Padding in a flash, it's peanuts
compared to how much he'll make on the deal.

And yes, someone selling leather paddings for 100p won't
sell them as often as someone selling them for a more
reasonable 5p.  But there's an old joke which addresses
this:

	A guy driving through the desert stops at the
	only gas station for 200 miles in any direction.

	After filling up his tank, he goes in to pay,
	and sees a cooler full of ice-encrusted Coke bottles.

	Guy: "Hey, that looks real good right about now,
	how much for a Coke?"

	Clerk: "Twenty dollars."

	Guy: "Twenty dollars?!?  You won't sell many at
	that price!"

	Clerk: "Won't need to."
