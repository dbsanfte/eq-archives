I'm not familiar with it, I've seen Jetsam but that wasn't nearly as 
impressive.  30/35 is pretty impressive for a drop off mid 30s mobs.

Well, immediately once taunt fired and stuck... how long that takes and 
how long a mob actually lives might turn this into "halfway thru".  He 
did apparantly manage to hang onto aggro once he got it.

OP said the SK wasn't using clinging darkness.   Jolt, isn't that a 
ranger tool for reducing aggro?  Monk doesn't have that and SK wouldn't 
be using it (and AFAIK doesn't have it anyway).  Maybe some other SK 
tool I don't know about is named something similar?

Well sure, thats where its from, but how do -you- express "there are

Oh sure, its very possible that the group was better off with the monk 
tanking all or at least part of every mob; my berserker frequently does 
the same thing; he's heavily regen geared and doesn't take damage 
embarassingly badly, so soaking up a decent amount of hits saves healer 
mana.  Mind you, for this to apply, you have to convince your healer not 
to heal you, not always an easy job.

Point is, though, the OP was asking about how SK and monk stack up in 
terms of aggro, not about whether this was a good thing under the 
circumstances.
