Yeah, that's the dilemna game designers face, isn't it: who's the target
market and what do they mostly want to do. The successful mmog is more than
a game, it's a community, and in order to gain traction it really needs to
find that sweetspot that balances action with socializing. One gets the
feeling that CoH strongly favors the more active, less social, direction.
That might be ok if there were more things in place to supplement the social
experience:

1) Ability to make chat windows for dedicated chats (what's up with those
one-sided conversations in Friends channel lol). These chat windows should
be supported with an interface that allows one keystroke to select a chat
window and start sending input to it.
2) Server-wide looking for team tool. Don't make me go to Independence Port
to find members for my Perez Park mission.
3) Message waiting indicator for email. Email is useless if people don't
check it and they won't check it if they don't know they have mail waiting.
While you're at it, please make it easier to create and use distribution
lists.
4) SWG had a great idea of including the abilty to save waypoints and then
send them as an attachment to an email. Imagine if you could email someone a
waypoint to your location or just send them an email to your favorite
hunting spot. Or just answer the question "Where can I buy Tech SO's" by
emailing a waypoint.
5) More functional lists. The Friends list is cool because it shows current
location. Why doesn't the SG list? Wouldn't it be nice if you could do an
Info on anyone in the list (or anyone on the Players Seeking Team list)? And
why can't the archetype icons show what type of archetype a player is? When
I see a blue shield, I have no idea if it's they're Kinetics, Forcefield, a
healer. Why do I care what the Origin is, that 2nd icon is useless, give me
instead a visual indicator of archetype group.

Ooops. This is turning into a wish list message. Really, this is just
scratching the surface of things that would improve the social experience of
the game. As it is now, there are very few tools that advance the social
aspect of the game and I think it's already taking its toll on the
population.
