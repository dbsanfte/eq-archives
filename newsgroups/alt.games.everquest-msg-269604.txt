I don't have a Magelo, but I do maintain a private file that, among
other things, lists my equipment and stats.  (For one thing, it gives
me something to refer to when my bazaar mule sees an item and wonders
if it's an upgrade.)  Each time I ding, I update the file to account
for changes in "recommended level" items.

When I dinged 50, I noticed something odd.  My save vs Fire went up
by 1, even though none of my gear showed any change in that stat.  So
I stripped down, and found that my naked base SvF (as an Iksar Monk)
is 39, where it used to be 38.

Now, there's nothing wrong with having base stats increase as a
character levels up, and indeed I might wish for more of it, but
having it happen not at all through level 49, and then getting one
point in SvF (nothing else changed) at 50, seems weird.  I poked
around some (googling for "Iksar fire 39", for instance) and can't
find any mention of this.  Does anyone know anything more about
this, and possibly other, stat increases?
