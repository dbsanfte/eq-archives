Hey group, hope someone can help this newbie here.
First of all, I agree with everyone that says this game should be called
EverCrack instead of EverQuest. I can't get enuff of the darn thing!!!
My question is this: How important is that starting note you have to turn
into your guild when you first start off? I mean if you want to join the
Paladin guild, w/o that note, how do you actually join it? I hear that you
also get a few points of training if you turn in your note. I'm a lowly
level7 so a few points aren't going to hurt me either way, but I may put
them towards something I might not have otherwise just to try it out.
I'm just counting down the minutes until I can play again. I'm jonesing big
time.
