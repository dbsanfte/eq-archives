I can't help with the twinking question because I'm pretty new.  But as far
as the name one goes . . . I've deleted my druid a few times at the
beginning because being a "newbie" I made the mistake of "supposedly"
putting my skill points in the wrong skills . . . so, in light of that, as
soon as I deleted the char I was able to make them again with the same name
immediately.  There was also an added plus of having the windows still set
the way I had set them and my hot buttons still there since I used the same
slot again....I'm not quite sure if this was just luck, or if it always
happens though :) Hope that helps you a bit . . .
