    They didn't want people flagged up to Rallos Zek (so Mith Marr, Agnarr,
Bertox, Saryn minimum)? That surprises me a bit, given how strict some
others "uberguilds" are about flags these days. If they're the only
elemental planes guild on your server they have more than enough to do as
is. Rings and nameds repop in elemental planes in three days, so just
clearing Fire, Water, and Air can be a full-time job, never mind farming
Earth, Rallos, Sol Ro, and the Sol Ro Trials.

    They likely haven't killed anything new. Saying on your guild page "we
farmed the same crap we've farmed 20 times before and will farm 20 times
again" is sort of tacky to some. And saying "we have X keys to the Xegony
event, we now understand the spawn pattern and AoE's of the minibosses in
Corinav and we've made significant progress towards an Earth B key" isn't
the sort of information a guild wants to give out, and it's not the sort of
information someone gets excited by reading.

    When one of the competition guilds on my server killed Fennin Ro
recently, they went around looking for people in my guild and would stand in
front of them with the shield equipped, moving to stay in front of them.
Sometimes it's nice, like that cleric doing the MGB or our people going AFK
for the night on the PoTranq beach with shields equipped. Sometimes it's
just tacky.

    Tell me one of them was Seethur. He seems like a knob from his
messageboard posts.
