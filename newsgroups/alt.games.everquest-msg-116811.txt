I decided last night to give my lower level character a 4 compartment
fanny pack. Rather than taking the time to solicit a third person or
running off to some isolated area in the middle of no where, I just
picked a low traffic platform, camped my low level against a pole.
Brought my higher level to the same spot, laid the pack down and hit
camp.  Before my camp timer expired, some little dwarf bugger came
running by, grabbed the pack, and hustled off !!   There was nothing I
could do but sit and watch my pack run off as I faded away. It was
actually kind of funny, a sort of drive by mugging.  Guess I'll have
to be more cautious should I decide to 'tweek' something of any real
value.   :-)
