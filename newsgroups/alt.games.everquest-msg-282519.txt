	Hey, I hear that tomorrow they're going to roll back characters
that were standing next to someone who logged on from the same IP
block as someone who thought about buying something from someone who might
have got it from one of those beta vendors...

	I've been pretty busy for the last week.  Absolutely ALL I've
done is leave my trader up (where he finally sold a couple of old school
but mid range items that I've had for years) and log in an alt to finally
level that last yellow to 55.

	When I dinged I logged my trader to move some stuff to the shared 
bank and then the alt to get it.  Oh, but whoops! Someone must have bought
something from the trader with tainted plat, because this morning he's 
back to where he was Wed except that anything he picked up from the shared
bank or another player in the meantime has poofed.  Oh well, a couple of
tens of K not really fatal just annoying.  And of course those damned
items that I'd finally sold are back grrrr.

	But my poor alt!  Not only is he 54 again, but since his spells and
new ornate came from the trader, they've poofed.  (I picked them up in 
anticipation of leveling so they weren't in my inventory prior to Wed.)
I feel the loss of level most acutely.  That just doesn't seem fair.
And what burns me is the people who bought my stuff.  They've surely been
rolled back.  Do they think I'm some kind of criminal and that it's my
fault?  One person came by and bought a couple of low level druid spells
I'd had hanging around for 6 months.  How much playtime did he or she lose
because someone who may or may not have cheated bought something from me?

	Bah.  From now on I won't even log in for 3 days after a patch.

	Oh, and Sony?  You really suck.
