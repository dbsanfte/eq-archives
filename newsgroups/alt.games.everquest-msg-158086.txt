I can't say that I hear necros whine *nearly* as much as I hear it
from druids. That may have something to do with it.

Hardly. Any animosity in this regard, however, stems from the fact
that you have had it so easy over the years, and everyone knows it. I
tried to octa-kite and even quad-kite with my rogue the other
day...didn't work out too well.

Maybe not, but you can sure lay partial claim to an awful lot of
different abilities shared with other classes - heal, buff, speed,
nuke, track, forage,...the list goes on.

Don't really know if I would actually call druids "overpowered" - more
like overly self-sufficient. Druids can often level faster soloing
than grouping. What would *you* call it?

So, you lump everyone who disagrees with you into the group of people
you consider "misguided fools who like to pick on Druids"? That's real
logical *and*, dare I say, open-minded.

Since we're throwing sweeping generalizations around, how about the
fact that you are spoiled by playing the easiest class in the game for
so long and are merely throwing a temper tantrum stemming from the
greedy contempt you feel at others getting access to services over
which you previously held a lucrative monopoly.
