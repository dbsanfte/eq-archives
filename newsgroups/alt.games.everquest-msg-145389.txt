First off you don't have to have a surname. My current main is level
41 and has not taken a name yet. I am waiting for a special occaision
or a major event to happen to him in-game that will cause him to take
a surname. My choice is based on a role-play decision.

Now if you want a surname...I would recommend you come up with
something that reflects the characters personality or class/skills.
For example if the character is a bard you could choose something like
"Sweetsong" or "Battlehymn". For a druid or shaman you might want
something like "Spiritwolf" etc, etc, etc.

I am sure you will get some other suggestions. 

Have fun
