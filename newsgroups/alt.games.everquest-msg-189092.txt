/agree

Diet Pepsi > Diet Coke
and
Coke > Pepsi

I think the reasoning for this is that I have gotten so used to drinking
Diet Pepsi, that regular Pepsi is way too sweet to stomach.  Coke Classic
has a bit more bite, and less sweetness than regular Pepsi, thus making it
easier to drink.

But really, if you can't get Diet Pepsi, than the next logical choice would
be Diet Vanilla Coke (boy I wish they would make this available on the
fountain machine.)
