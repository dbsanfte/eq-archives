With an enchanter hasting me, I've logged/parsed 5 punches registering in
the same second with a stick in my off hand (so the crushes were easily
distinguishable).  That means I had a triple and a double attack land in the
same second.  That's below 10 delay.

The problem is that the log file only registers 1-second increments.
