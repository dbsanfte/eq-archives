Looking at the eqatlas map for Kael
(http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/kaeldrakkalmap.html), we were
at the corner at about 1000, 1600.  The Statue came from
the south (not sure where he pathed from prior to
around 750, 1500), and after pasting our Bard he
headed north up the ramp at 1100, 1650, where we lost
visual track of him.
