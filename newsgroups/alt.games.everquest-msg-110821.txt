www.pricewatch.com is all you need to know when it comes
to buying discount computer stuff.

BTW, personally, I stay away from the mail-order joints
on the upper east coast (NY/NJ) -- most of them seem to
have 4 or 5 different "stores" but if you look at the
phone numbers/DNS/etc. they are all the same place.  Plus,
that stereotypical NY/NJ pushiness/rudeness has bee present
in *every* call I've ever made to one of them.  For me, it's
CA or midwest as my first choice.  I only mention this
because pricewatch is a price search engine, and you will
often see the NY/NJ places setting their prices a small
amount less so they appear higher on the list.
