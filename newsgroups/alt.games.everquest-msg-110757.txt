The reason for picking an odd number for /rand is there was a trick (that
afaik may still work) that 'locks' your /rand at a particular value (once
saw a guy rolling from 1 to 2 and getting 99...)

Other loot roll methods: Raid rolling:
/ooc from lootmaster: everyone who wants item X send tell
get list
/rand # of people on list
that person gets item
