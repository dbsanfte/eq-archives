    DAoC has something like this - when you pull mobs, you get a BAF bonus
based on how many come. EQ doesn't - you get the bonus directly for grouping
with others in order to handle large groups of mobs.

    Which is why even in DAoC, you rarely let multiple mobs hack on you. You
mez/park extras and end up killing them one at a time, or employ a strategy
(multi-rotting, quad-kiting) where you never get touched in the first place.

    No, not really. That would really tip the scales towards classes that,
solo, COULD pull multiples and live. In general, at higher levels (where
you'd actually care about an XP modifier) a solo player can only handle one
mob at a time. There are exceptions - druids and shamans can rot multiples,
wizards quad kite, and enchanters almost require more than one mob to solo
at all - but in most circumstances it's one at a time.

    And as for how it would impact groups, well, people complain enough
today about how an enchanter is a "required" class. It would be worse if
having one in your group made that much of an impact on your XP per unit
time.
