General notes for improvements:

Group spells and songs should also effect pets.

The pure melee classes need some serious love from SOE.
With every expansion casting classes get new spells but the melee
classes only get a few minor weapon and armor upgrades.

All buffs should stack. They don't have to have their full effectiveness
but they should at least add to some degree. For instance take the Druid
and Cleric AC/HP spells. The 49 Druid spell Skin like Nature adds 16 AC,
250 HP and 2 ticks of hp regen. The 48 cleric spell Resolution adds 16 AC
and
250 HP. Now stacked these spells don't have to add directly but they should
stack
to something like 19 AC 300 HP and 2 ticks of regen. Or even if the regen
just
stacked it would be nice.
