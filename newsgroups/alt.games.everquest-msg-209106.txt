Again thanks for the thoughts, last night made up for the previous night.

Came into a group, worked 'B1' for over an hour, and with a six person
group only had one death.  That person was bound at ShadowHaven
across the zone line.  I was just one short on that heal for the fellow.

I approached last night with three stacks of the componet for Symbol
of Transal, and cast it only on the tanks.  Everyone got the Center,
and Armor buffs, and strenght buffs, but they tended to drop and
we ended up just doing killing with heals, Symbol, and the occasional
stun when needed.

We even managed to kill 5 fiends that were trained on us by some
person, either an idiot, or on purpose, we were split on that.

Again, tasty exp., and gained a level to 18.  I'm camped there, but will
gate
out to PoK to get the level 19 spells in anticipation of that this evening.

The lesson learned was indeed good.
