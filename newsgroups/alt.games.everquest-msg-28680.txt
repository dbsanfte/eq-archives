I was unable to find any real way for newbie Iksar to make any kind of real
money on Allakhazam's or anywhere else.

Old world newbies have the GLS quest and HQ bear pelts (or what I used a
lot, gathering misty acorns).

But what is there for Iksar?  (those level 9 spells for shaman are rather
expensive) so far I've financed the 2 spells I have that were 5pp+ by
slaughtering level 1-2 creatures, but that takes a while and isn't very
entertaining (and no exp).

I tried fishing, but that took forever and didn't get me anywhere either.
And of course learning to bake, while fun, is no longer a money maker
(Thanks Verant!), and of course (as I have known for a while) the begging
skill is a waste of a hot button.
