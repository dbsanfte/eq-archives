Don't know about that... There's no such thing as free will if you don't 
have information ("And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make 
you free"). Since it was the Devil that tempted Adam and Eve into eating 
the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, it could be argued 
that it was Satan, in fact, that gave us free will.

Not that I believe in Genesis being anything other than fiction, of 
course.
