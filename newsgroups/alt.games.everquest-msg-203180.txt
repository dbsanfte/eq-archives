Not only that, but did you notice how they (SOE) changed the poll from "how
do you spend your time" to "how would you prefer to spend your time"?  Tells
me they have had a LOT of complaints.  KEI is not the issue for me...was a
cleric day one of commercial release and learned mana management before
there was even such thing as a level 51 enchanter, let alone a 60.  But why
nerf the exp for soloists?  As many have said before me, those of us that
WORK for a living get on and off at odd hours for short periods of
time...perhaps we just want to solo?  As for those who continually bring up
the "intent" of the game, I doubt most of them could put a last name to the
first name of "Brad" to discuss the "vision"... as for the question of why
those with alternate opinions are viewed as "children"?  My guess is because
those making those assessments have no clue how to engage in positive
debate....but just my .02...
