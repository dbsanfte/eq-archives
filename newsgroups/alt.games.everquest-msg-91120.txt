The problem, as I understand it, is that the guy who was tasked
with coding the bazaar feature is finished; it works, and it works
fine.

But it works with obscure commands like the original "book" command...

(take the page you want, divide by two, sacrifice chicken, multiply
by tangent between sun and zodiac....)

... it was MEANT to be integrated into the new interface.
....except the new interface isnt done yet.

So really, we're waiting for a bazaar that will let you click an
item and say "tag to sell", but they dont want to retrofit it to the
old interface as its duplicating work already done in the new interface,
but they dont want to release the new interface because its not done yet,
and they dont want to finish it because they're not done with luclin
stability and functionality yet.

Yuck ;) Cross dependencies!
