15 easy missions. Say 8 hards. And it isn't hard if you can get groups
for the right adventure camp or allready have it open. I know plenty
of top notch necros that still don't have Horror because of problems
with getting EF groups. And.. if you need the Malevolent as an
upgrade, I don't see you being able to handle tanking hards.

And 15 easy missions.. iirc 45 minutes is minimum time before you can
get new adventure, so minimum in a perfect scenario you are talking
11-12 hours before you get that BP. That doesn't include down time,
groups falling apart, groups that just suck and take much more time
than they should, or just the random group that decides to implode
after you started the dungeon. Its not just a matter of having them
hand you the points and you're good to go. All this for sub-par gear.
My main point was that if you're going to put in the time to get a
LDoN gear item, you might as well go for the best and get very
specific Royal Attendant pieces you aren't going to replace for quite
a while and pay the full price. Heck, even easier.. if you have a
guild or friends that do BoT towers on a regular basis, its more than
likely you'll end up getting an ornate BP drop over time which blows
the Malevolent version away.
