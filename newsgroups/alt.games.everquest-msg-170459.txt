There's nothing resembling a Korean restaurant around where I live.
However, the sushi chef at my favorite restaurant is Korean, so I think
that should count.

And what's this about too much sushi?  I had no idea there was such a
thing!  You eat until you're full, then compress it all with some green
tea.  Then you eat until you're full again.  Then for dessert you have
green tea ice cream. :-)

Actually, I enjoy most kinds of oriental food I've eaten, but there's
something about sushi that I keep coming back for.  Thai food comes in a
close second.
