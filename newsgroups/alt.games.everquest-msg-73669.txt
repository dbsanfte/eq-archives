Yes, but you still need training points. You start with five, and get five
more each time you level - player level, not skil level.

After you've reached a certain skill level in a particular area, training
costs skill points AND money. YOU ALWAYS NEED SKILL POINTS TO TRAIN. Skill
training costs LOTS of money at higher levels, BTW, so keep practicing ...
