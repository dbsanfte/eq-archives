A good example of this is the difference between my two most recent mods
Bare Bones Mod and TimerWatch (a simple mod mostly to demonstrate turning
BBM into a useful mod and my first mod, HealthWatch (both on my site, see 
my sig).

The first two are easy to follow.  I knew the how to do it, and I knew 
exactly what I wanted.  As a result the code is decent and fairly well 
commented.

HealthWatch is far less so - it grew organically and I wasn't sure what I
was doing as I wrote it.  As a result the code is sprawling and less
consistent in its naming conventions.

Also, the experimental utility class in TW has a problem that isn't 
obvious - The :New method is culled directly from the Programming Lua 5.0
book on the Lua.Org site - but fails if you declare another class with
the same code - the distinction between this and self in blizzard's 
implementation and the official implementation rears its head.
