>Life isn't fair. 

EQ isn't life. EQ is a game. For a game to be fun everyone has to play
fair by the rules. Buying characters or items is against the rules.

It's no differently than forking over real money to get more monopoly
money. It's cheating. And it's lame. It's about the sorriest thing any
human can do.

That goes for buying.

For selling its a different story. It's not cheating or lame, just
very immoral. Encouraging and supporting other people to cheat for
your own personal gain cheapens everyone else's experience whether
they know it or not. If you or anyone can live with that, well, more
power to you I guess, just hope that there's no such thing as
karma....
