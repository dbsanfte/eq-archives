	I believe that what you're failing to consider is that you regen
mana much faster by killing it then medding than by constantly running 
around trying not to go OOM.  So you actually get better mana throughput
by just getting it over with and sitting down than by trying to carefully
monitor mana usage.

	And I really don't see how a solo cleric (or wizard!) could kill
and NOT go OOM.  Without chain nuking they can't kill a thing and there's
no way to regen faster than you use it up nuking...  Especially with the
cleric your-target-has-resisted-AGAIN line.

	Killing light blues or one shotting greens really doesn't count.
That's the trivial solution :-)
