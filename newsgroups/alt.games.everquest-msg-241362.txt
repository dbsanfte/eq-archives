Because you could flame over the fun things - website spamming, plat 
duping, raid vs xp grinding, survivor...and if the netiquette scofflaws 
doesn't acceed to a polite request, then you can flame them.

Like i said above, give people half a chance to react to polite 
behavior, then if they dont acceed, take harsher actions. I still think 
the flaming in response to the hello newsgroup was entirely off base. 
Let them have half a chance to lurk, say hello, get directed to a faq 
and dabble their toes in the pool a bit...not just jump down the throat 
of the first poster. Sure, I wouldnt have phrased it quite the same way 
he did, though after I determined what was going on, it looked to me he 
was making the first post in the forum as a welcome to this thread to 
the people on the emarr forums, not thinking that it would look like he 
was welcoming us to our own newsgroup...

Fair enough, closest I happen to have is me in an elizabethan, but it 
does have a fairly low neckline as clothing goes:

ok, I *do* have a couple shots of my pussy........cats. I happen to have 
my own cat Banzai, and one my one of my exroomies left with me when she 
emigrated to Australia...

I know it is general etiquette to lurk, but many people dont feel like 
lurking. I could post the link and a welcome letter bi weekly, and post 
it if I notice someone new popping up [like the hello group posts] and 
when I notice a new top poster  *if* people will let me have a go at the 
top posters before flaming them.

And could you tell me how I get my sig file to attatch in netscape? and 
please dont suggest getting a different newsreader, I like netscape and 
dont really have the desire to add yet another program to the shrinking 
space in my poor laptops HDD...=)
