I have a 51 monk who went from level 18 to 40 without dying once, and then
only died maybe one or two times from 40 to 51.   However, at level 51 I
died about 5 times pulling a Naggy raid, but that's a bit different.  My
51st bard hasn't died from anything but the LD monster since fighting in
loio around level 20-25.  I guess you could say that some of us are always
aware of our surroundings and know how to avoid death better than others.
