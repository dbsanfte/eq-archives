The space need to store a character is trivial. Say one byte per ascii
character and a 6letter string to identify anything. You need race, level,
class - all doable by 2number strings. You need spells held in book (say a
6 letter code for each) - 400spells say 2400 letters, 30 inventory items
another 200 (including loc ID), inventory 10 containers, 10 items - 600
letters plus say 100 for organisation, cash 4 by 3 letter strings plus id
letter - 16letters - stats and resist bases call it 15 by 3 (50 for ease).

So what are we at - just under 3.5 thousande bytes of data. Say 4, up it
to 10 to include all the stored personal data and multiply by half a
million for the number of accounts by 40 for the number of servers and by
8 for the characters per server. I make that 1500 gigabytes.

Now a) Iv massively inflating the data needs by assuming that everyone has
every character slot filled, b) Ive assumed a decimal notation not
hexadecimal (which it almost certainly is). Despite that to run at full
capacity to store this data they need - 10, just 10 big HDDs

Given the level of server power (one machine runs between 1-3 zones so my
friends in the field tell me) - 10 big disks for character storage aint a
lot.

Someone techy will be able to estimate how much overinflation I have done
and how much a hexadecimla notatin would save (im not good at factorial
maths)
Add to that the fact a lot of people do not have 8 full characters on
every server (Id guess im typical with a total of about a dozen characters 
on one account) you can shave off vast fractions.

Frankly it would not surprise me if the entire database did end up on one
hard disk.

As to retaining, I had one friend reactivate his account briefly after 2
years and they were still there.
