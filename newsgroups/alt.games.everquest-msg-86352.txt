As others have mentioned, you can get to Kunark by taking the boat
from Oasis to the Overthere (check out www.eqatlas.com for maps).  

You will be KOS in Cabilis.  You can raise faction with one set of
guards (the Troopers, warrior guards on Legion of Cabilis faction) by
killing Sarnaks, goblins and outlaw Iksars (bandits, marauders,
manslayers, etc.); eventually once you kill enough, you will be
dubious to the troopers.  However, you will still be KOS to the other
set of guards (the Crusaders, SK guards on Crusaders of Greenmist
faction--one of the Crusaders, Crusader Quarg, is actually on shaman
faction).  To raise your faction with the Crusaders, once you become
dubious to the Troopers, do the bone chip quest with Trooper Mozo, one
of the guards in Field of Bone near the entrance to Cabilis.  I think
it takes several thousand bone chips to become non-KOS to the
Crusaders.

There is a very good guide on raising Cabilis faction at:

Hope that helps!
