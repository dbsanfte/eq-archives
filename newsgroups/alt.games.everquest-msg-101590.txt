I've just started an Iksar monk, and I put all 20 starting points into
strength, as the castersrealm guide said to.  Now I'm starting to wonder,
before I get much further, was that such a good idea?  Can any experienced
monks tell me what stat is actually the best to put those starting points
into?

Thanks.
