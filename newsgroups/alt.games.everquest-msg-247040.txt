<<<Is it just me, but on a patch day does anyone else have problems
logging in for hours after the servers have come back up?

According to the status message, all servers are up, and if the patch
notice says downtime will be 5 hours, say. I can wait 10 hours and
STILL not be able to get in, either with servers unavailable or patch
server unavailable, or server congested errors.

If I check with other people I know, they are able to get into the
game, while I am still getting the same "server unavailable" messages
for several more hours.

Most patch days its just easier to go to the cinema or something else
real worldy, which isn't a bad thing I guess.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I've always been bothered by this as well.  In a perfect world I guess the
Login Server would be able to line up incoming requests and take them in order
of first appearance rather than getting the busy signal.  At least that's how I
summarize it.
