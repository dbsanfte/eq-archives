After the first mob in Kaesora, this becomes a horrific nightmare of an idea,
unless the OP's "friends" includes no melee, or at least one porter.

Drop over the ledge, and Kaesora becomes a fairly long one way trip, if you can't
gate out you are stuck crosssing half the zone to get out.  Like Chardok (a much
shorter crossing) the zone is a mix of live and undead, so niether invisibility nor
ITU will let you jog across, either.

Go in, have something come up, and you are trapped, there's no quick way out,
except perhaps to deliberately die and have someone come summon your body later.

Of course I'm a big fan of the "every group should have a porter" plan for just
this reason, after all, get fairly deep into a two way dungeon and you are in the
same boat, its going to take just as long to get out as it did to get in.

Still, I think this "feature" is one of the things that prevented Kaesora from ever
becoming a popular spot.  Most people go there for one reason only, to kill Xalgoz
for his part to a Howling Stones key.
