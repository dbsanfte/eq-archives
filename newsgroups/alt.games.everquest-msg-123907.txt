So I was in FV hunting when I pick up a Foggie Shaman. This is the new
and improved caster type too. So my Shaman and pet fight him, he is
only a blue to me. Well, I am lucky if I can cast 6 roaring winters
and get any decent hits off it before my mana is all gone, during that
time, the froggie debuffs me, then my pet, dispells my buffs twice,
hits me with two DOTs, then chain casts frost spell.  I lose because
he is also buffed and sow'd. No escaping him.

Now in the old days, verants excuse was that the casters were dumb and
they were given advantages one of which was that they had an
abnormally high mana pool to draw on. Did I miss that they nerfed that
too? I think not based on my last experience. 

Was I just having a bad day or are the casters more lethal due to
their mana advantage plus "smarter" casting skills?
