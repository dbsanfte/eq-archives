I bet your playtime isnt in such a compressed period of time though. Mine
starts in April 1999 and there *werent* AA's back then ;)

As for rangers... WTF? Lol ;) I dont think a 15 minute-per-mob-kill kite
is quite competitive with grouping if thats what you're getting at. All
my AA's come from grouping, because its the most efficient way to get it.

I doubt I have even a single AA point from soloing. I tried it once when
I first got AM3/EQ (POV, Larvae, sucked) and once when I was EP (Fire,
kiting tables mobs up and down the fennin ramp, took ages, boring,
sucked).
