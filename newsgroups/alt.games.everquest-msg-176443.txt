Whether or not I understand your collection of
seemingly random links, has nothing to do with the
accuracy of your statements. And that is what is
being discussed, not "actual ecological issues".

Why are you having so much difficulty with this
simple task?

All you need to is to quote the relevant figures
that prove your assertion, (which you keep trying
to snip from the thread) that China is the biggest
producer of pollution, and that the US is not in
the top ten.

Either pee or get off the pot.
