Umm, no.

Believe it or not, I do know something about the game I'm playing, and
I'm not a 3-boxer, nor am I in a GoD/Time level guild.  No, I don't
know anything about those two pieces of content, and I never will; I
simply don't have the support structure behind me, just like *most*
people, to get to that material.

The idea you espouse above, that you require uberguilds because they
"... will at least know what they're talking about..." is one of the
cruxes of the problem.  The uberguilds have no idea of the problems I
face, they have no idea of what I'd like to see, so how can *I* expect
that they will bring up *my* problems?  They will bring up the
problems that the uberguilds face, not the problems that the average
player faces.
