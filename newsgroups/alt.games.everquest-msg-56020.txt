Assumes you have invis, that there are no see invis mobs, that the
zone isn't a mix of live and dead, that nothings on your tail, and that
there aren't a plethora of traps, one ways, and other fun maze toys.

Also, is going to be fairly useless for finding your way back to the
party with a XXX on your tail... heck, even a -good- map is hard
to use under those circumstances, worse still if the mob pounding
you in the back is giving you stun spins.  Looking down and following
coins is a lot easier than doing /l and trying to track your progress
on a map.

Also assumes you want to map a zone, rather than actively
dungeon crawl into it.  If, on the other hand, what you wanted
to do is poke your way in around a turn or two and pull back
to your group, having a bread crumb trail is going to be a lot handier.
Since that "dungeon crawl" behavior seems to be Verant's "Vision,"
it sure seems contradictory to disable an excellent tool for doing so.
