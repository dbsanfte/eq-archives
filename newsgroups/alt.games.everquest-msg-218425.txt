This is indeed my basic position, but in order to accomodate some
outrageous sounding statements Faned made when I tried to pin him
down, I went to a new position; As long as Faned's group is under
50M, my group will stay 50M higher in mana pool than his group,
and play in the same way  (in other words, if he eschews 30M as a
"plus or minus" goal, thats fine, I will eschew my 80M goal as
well)

This is pretty much the same thing, but without the convenience
of a "goal point" (of 30M or 80M, respectively).

Faned's latest tactic seems to be to claim that his group uses
the new method, and yet that my group sticks to 80M.

As an exercise for the reader, I believe its possible to prove
that this supposed difference is irrelevant... but for the sake
of this arguement I've abandoned the "sticking point" approach
entirely, in favor of whatever mysterious, as yet undescribed,
method Faned uses to determine when to pull what.  Tarot cards,
D30, examining the entrails of pidgeons, whatever.
