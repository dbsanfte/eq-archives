Thank you so much for your help. They had made me feel that I was gonna be
tossed out from the game. I was worried. My sons have tried to get me in
this game for almost 2 years and I  was really having fun and most everyone
I meet is really nice. I can see why all of you like to play so much. Well
I'll go hack and kick some more, Oh I'm on ayonae ro sever.
Thaanks again.
Pat
