I got the same email from Sony and, having not played the game in a year,
figured my old characters were long gone...  Lo and Behold!  There is my
Ranger and the assorted other peanut gallery from a year ago...

You just have to download the software from the site and they will already
have the keys registered to your username and password so you should be all
set.  The best part for me is, after a year going to the bank and looking
through everything and going, "What the HECK was I saving THAT for?"  LOL

I even found a couple of heads in the bank that for the life of me I
couldn't remember why I had them...  hehe
