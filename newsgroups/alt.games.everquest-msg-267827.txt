Not quite. Some of us, including me, think that EQ and EQ2 are both 
"everquest". Nobody is arguing they are the same game, any more than 
Godfather and Godfather II are the same movie... but they are *both* 
Godfather movies, and if this was a ng for disucssing Godfather movies 
then discussion of Godfather II (and even III) would be on topic.

A good number of posts are being labeled EQ2. And I, at least, am not 
having much trouble sorting them out. Are you?

Sure the ng is still there. There isn't any conversation in most of 
them, there isn't any community in most of them.

The community will disintegrate if traffic falls below a threshold.

Are you serious? That's pretty thick of you.

Half the EQ1 players here are migrating to EQ2. We didn't need EQ2 to 
"shore up the numbers" because the numbers weren't being cannibalized by 
EQ2. EQ2 is the -cause- of the EQ1 traffic slump, not its saviour.

Today.

CoH was the same phenomena, and that was -here- where it was off topic 
in the everquest group. CoH posts have died out entirely here, and even 
the CoH group is very low traffic now, according to reports.
