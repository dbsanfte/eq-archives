And, from some of MY experience(s);  4. Check the EQCLIENT.INI file for 
the line that says "windowed mode=1" or something like that, and change 
the 1 to a 0 (zeero).  My machine was having the same problem till I 
found that little change.  Don't remember where I found that info, 
though, so maybe it's been tried already.
