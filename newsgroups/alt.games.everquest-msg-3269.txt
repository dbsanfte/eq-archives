My memory may be failing me, but I'm pretty sure that Sword said he's
visiting from the FA group.  I haven't seen anything from him that implies
that he's interested in buying the game.  But hell, I could be wrong...Sword
didn't strike me as interesting reading, so I might have missed where he
said it in one of his myriad other posts (I've only read 2).
