Step right up, ladies and gents!   See EQ contort this way and thay
way, juggling provocative wording, and perform amazing feats of
selective interpretation!   Is there nothing this man won't do to
avoid answering a question?  Is there any length he won't go to, to
avoid admitting he has no rebuttals?

You challenged me to something, I met the challenge.  You won't
acknowledge it, you don't have the balls to disprove my points, so now
you're desperately grasping at straws.

You can save your "choice" debate for someone who bites, EQ.  Just
answer the points I made, or concede you cant!   Here they are again,
repeated just for you little self, since you demand special treatment:
