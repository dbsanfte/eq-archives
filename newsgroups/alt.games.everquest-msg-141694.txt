Not many better earings at your level, another Cougar Claw would be good
(cheap as muck now Bazaar is up) There's ths Sarnak Earing of Station but I
have killed thousands of the feckers and I've not seen one, so I wouldn't go
hunting sarnaks expecting to find one quickly.

You will want to replace the Crusty, I know the Legs have Great Stamina but
the arms are low in AC (same as Mithril) look in Bazaar for Vambracers of
Avoidance, AC12 +3str +5vs Magic I picked some up for 150pp for a Twink.
If you have some cash then  Crystal Chitin Arms are dropping in price (AC18
+5str/sta) and Dragonleg Breeches are also falling.

Rest is pretty decent, I wouldn't say anything really sucks at all. At your
level I didn't have much better, if at all, in fact. There isn't really any
spots wasted, if you're looking for real upgrades then you want to get on
some hate raids for Indo' or see if you can't start some of the Champions
armour quests in Velious.
