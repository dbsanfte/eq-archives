Aha!  My wife doesn't like to pull so I understand.  And she wears 
headphones listening to the radio while we play so I have to do tells to 
her or yell.  If you get in this situation my advice is to nod and smile 
a lot.

When I pull with my cleric I usually hit the mob with a nuke, then 
either train it on my beloved (by running out of the mob's agro range) 
or root it on top of her.  Taunt works fine too, but it relies on your 
spouse paying attention, and I can't always pull during commercials.

If your cleric is at least level 34, consider using the Atone spell.  It 
has a chance to erase the mob's agro.  Of course the mob will be mad at 
you again the next time you heal, but in the meantime you're in good 
shape.  If you get multiples, root/pacify/atone them to get them to stop 
attacking.  This doesn't work very well since the nerfs a while back, 
but it might be better than nothing.  And if root breaks the mob might 
wander back to its spawn point, which might be a good thing.

Something like that, but I believe most mobs that summon are level 51+. 
  Remember, the Atone spell is your friend here.  I could be wrong, but 
I don't think a mob can summon you if it has forgotten you exist.
