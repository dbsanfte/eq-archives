I don't know how it works or even if it is the same one. With a druid
charm<animal> spell, when you issue a /pet kill command other non-charmed
monsters would assist under certain circumstances.

I am pretty sure that when and if charm on the actual target broke, the
assisting non-charmed pet just wandered off rather then attack you.

Charm a wolf, have it attack a bat, and a bear jumps in on the wolf's side
of the fight kind of stuff. It seems to work on some pretty big stuff. I've
never really had it happen a lot and when it does if has always been more
like the bat doing the volunteer work vs a griffene.
