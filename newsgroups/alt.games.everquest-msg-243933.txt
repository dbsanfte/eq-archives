I disagree.

I can name a number of items both easily obtained at low level and 
virtually worthless that will fetch 50-200+ tribute... enough to put you 
into EB for an hour+. (Not a bad deal for someone without a proper EB 
item. Better than buffs & waterstones, since it can't be dispelled and 
doesn't use up a buff slot.) Or a little FT (for a charming Bard in 
particular), and is extremely affordable if you 'farm tribute items'... 
(or are at least aware of th tribute values of the items where you are 
farming xp/cash)
