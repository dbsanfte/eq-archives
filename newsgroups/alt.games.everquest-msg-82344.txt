Quick question, before I go off and re-invent the wheel (which I'm too
lazy to every enjoy).

Does there exist already an EQ log trimmer?  Something that you could
set to go through a log and (conditionally) remove /locs, /guildsay's
and /gsays, etc?  I'm toying with writing one, but again - don't want
to if one exists.

Or maybe grep is the solution?

I'm aware of several log splitters (ie Pasketti's) that certainly
work, but am looking for an option that will help me keep my one huge
logfile a little more svelte before I absolutely need to split it.  

I'm a big of a stats geek and love Pasketti's EQLog program and the
way it'll break things up by level to see progress...
