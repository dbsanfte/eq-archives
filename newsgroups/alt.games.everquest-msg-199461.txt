I agree wholeheartedly.  My Druid on FV (Human, WIS 160ish with over
300 in +mana) still enjoys mixing it up, but I don't do it very often
anymore because his Defense is at 175 and it just isn't as effective
as root/dot/med.  But one of the nice things about having kept my
Defense up and wearing gear with decent ac/hp on it, was being able to
do things like telling off some wannabe KSers while an HG was beating
on my back.  I haven't known too many Druids who could get away with
that at L35.
