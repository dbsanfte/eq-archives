If you didn't accept or deny and leave the invitation hanging, do you
notice if the old bug is still there?  There used to be an issue when
the group was nearly full when a few more was invited and one accepts
to make the group full and the others doesn't accept or decline, those
toons can leech xp while outside of the group.
