It won't matter unless the dungeons are so linear that you have to
kill everything on the way to whatever the boss mob is. It does mean
that people will end up playing a game of "beat the dungeon" instead
of just enjoying a dungeon crawl which is what I was hoping for. So
no, it probably won't matter, so why put it in? 

Got a necro and mage in the group, it's trivial to bypass most of the
content. Got a good SK in the group, unless the mob is permarooted
he'll just pull it to where the group is and ignore everything in
between. Got a monk in the group, let him train the mobs out of the
way so the group can pass through quickly. Make the mobs so difficult
that none of this is possible and you just made Enchanters and most
other forms of crowd control useless because the mobs hit too hard to
take more than 2 at a time for your average group (see PoP).
