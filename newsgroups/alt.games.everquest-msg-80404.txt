Note: I don't play on a PvP server, but here's what I know.

Rallos Zek

PvP free for all, within 5 level limit you can attack anyone and the winner
of a PvP fight loots all coin and one item not in a bag in the general
inventory or a piece of armor

Tallon/Vallon Zek

Racial Team PvP with the 5 level limit, loot is all coin on the loser, no
items
Teams are;
Shorties, gnome halfling dwarf
Humans, Human, Barbarian, Erudite
Evils, Dark Elf, Iksar, Ogre, Troll
Elves, High elf, Wood elf and Half Elf
No idea what team Vah Shir are on.

Sullon Zek

I'm less clear with what happens on this server, but there's no 5 level
limit but you can cause exp loss within the limit, I believe its coin loot
and there's some sort of team structure.
