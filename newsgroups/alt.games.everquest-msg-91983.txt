That's why he pointed out that 90% of the people know to "train
right."   Unless you were in a group full of people who hadn't been
there before two or three times (unlikely, but possible) *someone*
in your group probably knew.   Simply watching the shouts and
OOC will inform you within an hour or two.

Well first it is because you're new that you didn't know and now
you say it's a choice to play differently than the rest.  You're a
druid that insists on melee or a cleric who doesn't have a heal
mem'd, right?   People who don't play by generally accepted
conventions find themselves outcast.   You should know that if
you've been playing three years.   ANYONE who trains left in KC
more than a time or two gets put on almost everyone's "moron's
to avoid" list.

Peer pressure is rarely nice or logically explained.  Most people
learned that in kindergarden or elementary school.   Sure, you
may have a friend who'll show you the ropes *first* or explain what
you did wrong nicely later.  But everyone else isn't likely to be all
sweetness and light when you've just trained them.

But I guess you've been playing three years without ever witnessing
a train.  That's pretty unusual:  I think I saw my first one the first
hour I played....
