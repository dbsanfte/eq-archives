Hardly.  The first time I saw Quarm (at 65), I saw Quarm die.  That applies
to a whole lot of other mobs along the way as well.  There are of course
mobs that pose problems and need to be learned, and I'm not saying that
those first encounters are pretty, as they usually aren't, but it's far from
certain death.  The "deathtouch" encounters referenced earlier in this
thread, and the difference from the old version of "deathtouch" encounters,
means that some mobs will be very hard to learn and have an element of luck
even after they are fully learned.  If you go in with a good set of
instructions and a raid force that can pay attention and follow instructions
perfectly, even those are far from certain death on the first try.

I guess that being in a "hardcore" raiding guild...  I only raid once every
six months.  Interesting viewpoint.  =P

And none of its competitors has managed to provide what it has lost.  In
fact, they started out with more "lost" than how EQ is currently.  In the
raiding game, no other game on the market compares to EQ.
