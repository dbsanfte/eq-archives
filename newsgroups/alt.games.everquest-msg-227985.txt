I was going to mention that same spot as ideal for his purposes.  At 63 
he should be able to wipe every mob in the place, in fact while I was 
camping the ring I not only killed every goblin there, but did it 
without ever hitting one; I got my summoned hammer up, buffed it while 
it was killing a PH, then proceded to keep aggroing new mobs before the 
one it was on died, running all the way around finding every goblin on 
that half of the zone for him to kill.

Thats how easy the mobs were, at 54, and a good measure, I think, of 
exactly how bored I was after 12 hours camping him.

At any rate, a suggestion would be to make a ranger, level him up a bit 
and work on tracking, and then post -him- in that spot.  That way, you 
can check on grimmie with tracking periodically, and run your cleric 
over only if he's up.  If you can't be bothered actually killing the 
PHs, I guess that could take a few months, though.

Another thought might be to camp there shortly before a patch, log on as 
soon as a patch is over, and see whats up.  I don't know if its true of 
Grimblox, but many mobs of this sort are always up after a patch, and 
only get replaced by their PH's after they are killed.  You'd have to 
arrange to be there first, though, might be other clerics with the same 
clever idea.

Take heart, this is the last "rare spawn greenie killing" camp; after 
this everything is either "always up" or, in the case of the pearlescent 
fragment hunting, isn't a case of rare spawn but rare drop, and might 
still be exp even at 63 if you look about for the higher level mobs in SF.
