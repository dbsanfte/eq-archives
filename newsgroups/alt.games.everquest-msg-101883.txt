Yes. I swear my skelly gets stupider the higher level he gets. I often find
myself running somewhere, turn around and Jobober is nowhere to be seen. Run
back to find him watching snakes slither through the grass.

He likes to play games too ... I'll be running, turn around, he's not there.
Run back a little ways, still not there. Turn around, he's standing right in
front of me, looking at me like "Where you been?"
