I understand what you're saying, but that is not what I am referring to.

You only need to look back, and you will see it. Not to flame you at all,
but you could liken it to the male strays that follow the bitch around the
neighborhood, peeing on every tree along the way, as well as each other on
occasion. She is unknowingly leading the pack, and only turns her head when
one of the strays gets bit by another stray.

Its a strange community, but entertaining nonetheless.
