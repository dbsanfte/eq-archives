Yeah, my mage got one on third floor in Dalnirs. I /shouted for
someone more needy to get it. Noone came so I looted. Next day, my SK
buddy was mad as hell when told him to inspect me and look at earing
slot hahaha

Was there for 15 or so hours over 3 days and saw exactly one.  Keeping
almost all of second half of third floor clear. Well, Kobener did
anyways. Never did get Foci Robe, my whole point of being there. Got
everything else tho :(
