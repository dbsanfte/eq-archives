To be clearer...  You need 2 account keys.  You could possibly still get a
classic key for free, but the Kunark/Velious/PoP and LoY addons will be more
than just Gold + LoY (and PoP depending on the Gold version, iirc.  So...
You need to copies of EQ as the only way of getting a key is to buy a copy
of the game (assuming you don't just want Antonica/Faydwer/Odus as your
hunting grounds).
