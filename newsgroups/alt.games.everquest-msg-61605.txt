I heard two people shouting back and forth in the EC tunnel about this
yesterday; according to one of them, the AoE damage to the party was a bug
which has been patched. Don't know if this is true or not, though.

Best thing to do is either talk to someone who has a Sword of Skyfire or buy
one, see for yourself when it procs, and sell it if it does hurt your
party....or save it for soloing and have some healing on-hand.
