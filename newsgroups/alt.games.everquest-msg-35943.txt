my partner just got his first portal spells.. north karana... greater fay..
tox.
yeah yeah yeah!!
except he can't seem to port both of us there.  we are grouped together.  he's
tried clicking on me.  clicking on him.  clicking on the freaking scenery :)
and still no go.
it just keeps fizzling over and over.  his alteration is "average".  is this
just a fluke or is there another explanation?
