I have an ogre warrior, and none of the merchants in shadowhaven will
sell to me.  I was told to do the quest with the head of the trade
commision, and i got the amulet of the heavens or whatever, which the
person told me would up my faction so the merchants would sell to me.
well, i did it all and put the thing on, and my faction is unchanged
and they all still yell about me being an ogre.  do i just have to do
this quest over and over again until my faction goes up?  and if so
any idea how many times?  thanks.

chuck
