Assuming the U.S. affixes blame to Bin Laden (and by association to the
Taliban), it seems they might bolster the Afgan fighters in the north of
that country with enormous firepower.  The hope would be that they can oust
the Taliban and capture Bin Laden.

If that's our course of action, I hope we bear in mind that our tinkering
with Afghanistan in the 80's to disrupt Soviet ambitions is largely
responsible for the Taliban's ability to gain power there, as we are the
people who armed them.  Such a shame, I think, that the military genius
Massoud was killed only a couple of days ago.  He might have been a
worthwhile ally.

As a side consequence, not insignificant in its own right, the women of
Afghanistan may soon regain the basic human rights stripped from them city
by city throughout the 90's.

I think it is most important that we are sure who did this before we act,
and then act with a ferocity that makes all terrorist-supporting nations
afraid.  If we hit the wrong country, we will have not only punished the
innocent, but let the guilty escape justice.  I dread the racist backlash
that could come of this.  I have known 3 Palestinians, 1 Sudaneese, and a
handful of Serbs in my lifetime, and they were each a wonderful person
despite the things their goverments (or better said, the thugs in charge)
could be blamed for.
