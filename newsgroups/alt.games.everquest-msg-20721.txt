Yep lying sacks of sh^t . Before the patch casting a slow spell would aggro
the mob onto me for about 4 rounds of combat before pet taunted it off .
After the patch its back to just using tash and letting pet whack it in the
back while it chases me through the countyside .

It wasnt broke they just felt like stealth nerfing pet classes back .
