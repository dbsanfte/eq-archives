Is it just me or have the last few days been slow for selling things? I have
seen a lot of people selling but not many people buying. I went to Kelethin
and sold a few things but for the most part no one was buying... and then I
went to North Freeport and saw the same thing. I talked with a few other
people in game and they all noticed the same thing.  I was just curious if
any of you had noticed this.
