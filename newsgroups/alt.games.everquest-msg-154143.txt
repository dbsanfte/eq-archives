Depends.  It's incredibly EFFECTIVE if you're trying to !#$% mem a spell or
camp out.   I was camping corrupted gobby the other day and wanted to camp
out.  Darned gobby spawned so I rooted him, ran off and started to camp.
DOH, arrow.  Since I didn't really want to bother killing the bastard I just
succored out.
