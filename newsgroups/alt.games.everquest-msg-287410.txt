So, I played EQ for a long time and still think it the greatest
computer game ever made but had some RL friends who wanted better
graphics and better crafting, buncha pansies really but.....

So we went to EQ2 for a very short time, before VG came out, switched
back to EQ, then to VG when it released.
The pansies all like VG better than EQ and we all like EQ and VG
better than EQ2.  However, EQ2 and VG both seem far too easy to me
having been an EQ player since 6mo after release.

Not that I'm pining away for hell levels again but I do miss the
just-crowded-enough zones where anything could happen at any time
(trains in BlackBurrow for example) and enough difficulty that a group
required strategy and tactics regardless of class makeup.

We're not certain how long VG will be around since the subscriptions
are not very high so I wanted to get a feel for how EQ is these days.
I've been out for a year now and recall when I left that I could
easily get groups with the guild but pickups were difficult.
Some zones were barren, even entire continents in some cases but other
zones had quite a few people in it, which is what I like.  I do play
MMO's after all, not MO's.

How has EQ fared in the last year?  Can we still get groups or do we
need to come ready built?  Are there enough people in different level
ranges to make groups possible?

Thanks.
