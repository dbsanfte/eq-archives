Which is why I pointed out that any solution involving real money must
also include a verification of identity.

It would be the exact same issues if opening a regular bank account.
Same hoops to jump through so nothing really new.

You wouldn't tax a specific in-game transaction. The tax gets levied
upon income generated by the transferral of money out of game, a
record of which is easily generated for tax purposes ala interest
statements now.

Yeah.. my thought was to call it a 'green' server. It would have the
rule set of a blue server while allowing the transfer to the new
currency. The main problems are two fold. First, you have to have
everyone sign up for it. Most people aren't keen to the trouble
involved and at the same time they aren't keen to the stripping of
anonymity, especially with sites like IGE available. Its something
that will take time.. whatever you do. Second, and this one is much
harder.. there is a piece of equipment that has to be designed in
order to verify identity. Picture a device the size of an ATM or
PCMCIA card that has its own setup of a minimal number of output
wires... you then adapt that via a connector to any port, be it USB..
firewire, etc. You carry it in your wallet and simply plug it into the
port when you wish to verify identity to access the account. The
current online banking security is rudimentary to say the least and
makes me shudder every time i see it.

Sure.. which is why any real money involvement also involves a
verification of identity. The nice part is.. if done right it can be
adapted to any business that buys and sells goods. Buy movie tickets
with it... restaurants... grocery store.. etc.

Because in order to do it properly it has to be tied to a physical
piece of hardware carried by the person. Trying to get people to
switch over is going to be a pain and development of hardware tends to
be expensive from the get go, and for items that don't exactly exist
yet... viewed as an extremely risky proposition.
