It is no longer necessary to play a porter to skip the boat rides.  Go
to your nearest Spire, take a ride up to the moon, and you have access
to all four pre velious continents plus the moon... Velious is your
only "boat or port needed" destination.

As a bonus, pad in to Shadowhaven and get a bind from the
soulbinder, and all you need do is strip naked and die to port
back up without waiting.

Wizard is an interesting class, but Port isn't really a great reason
to pick it, you'll have to get up into the high teens before you can
port yourself, and 29 before you can port a party around to even
the simplest destinations.  While "porter" is a vital part of groups
in the 50s, where getting out of dungeons is a tedious job at
best (and an extremely hazardous one at worst) its really just a
convenience for transportation purposes, and one that can easily
be hired for some pocket change.

Real job of a wizard is Snarer... and unfortunately there is a wealth
of classes that can do that.  Nuking, while certainly the job
Wizards do better than any other class, is overrated as an ability.
While great for killing any given mob, its not good for killing
lots of mobs over a given length of time, at least not till  you
get good AOE nukes.  With AOE snare and AOE nuke
and JBoots, TBoots or perhaps a horse, you can get good
at killing 4 mobs at a time with the energy most people would
use to kill one or two, at which point soloing up levels into
the 50s where you are finally desirable isn't hard or time consuming.
