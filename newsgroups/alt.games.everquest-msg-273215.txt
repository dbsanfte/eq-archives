   My apologizes if that is the case. The statement you made about "They
should cool down in jail over night" seemed fairly straight forward to
me, but I could have missed the nuances.  Is it your position, then,
that cooling down in jail over night is not the same thing as going to
jail?  Or is there some other point that I'm simply not getting?

  Actually, I was asking two separate questions. 1.) Should they go to
jail, for however short a period of time?  2.) If so, would you be the
one to order them to be incarcerated?  I do appreciate that in your
original statement that you qualify the "they should be jailed"
statement to only apply if they acted in a highly arbitrary manner to
one of the forum users, not if the forum user actually was doing thing
most would agree were worthy of being banned for.  So, just for the sake
of argument, let us say that they guy made some well reasoned, well
spoken criticisms of various aspects of the EQ or EQII game play, and
that he was promptly banned for the same.  I think that most people
would find this to be unreasonable on SOE's part (well, I would at any
rate).

  And this is where I get lost.  I think we are talking about one
instance.   The guy posts in the forums.  For this exercise, we assume
he posts in a reasonable manner.  He gets banned for it.  You say the
forum owners should cool off in jail. I ask if you are going to be the
one, were you in a position of that power, to send them off.  All this
stems from the same incident.  They guy posts, the guy gets banned.

   I'm not trying to flame you.  I know that tends to be the reaction
around here, but since I'm simply no good at it, I prefer to have a
reasoned discussion instead.  Who knows, I might end up learning
something.  I bring this up so that you can take my next statement in
the proper context.  I simply do not understand your analogy.  I am
talking about one incident.  The guy getting banned.  I know I sound
like a broken record, but it seems that this discussion is going on a
tangent that really isn't germane to the incident that started it all.

   Wouldn't be the first time I misconstrued something.

   On this I agree with you fully.  Their poor choices in customer
interaction is one of the main reasons I am no longer a customer of
theirs.  I'm a little disappointed that their approach to customer
interaction helped to strangle the fun out of a game that I truly loved
to play for over 4 years.  I don't know how many other regulars in age
would agree with this sentiment, but I firmly do.

   And you are being consistent in your statements.   If they did what
they are accused of, then you say they should cool off in jail
overnight.  Again, fair enough.  But if you truly believe they cool off
in jail over night, why wouldn't you use the power to send them in the
time out if you had it?  If it should be done, then I don't see why
there would be any moral dilemma in doing so.
