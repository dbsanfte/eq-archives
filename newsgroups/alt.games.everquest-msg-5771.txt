No, it means you don't have to worry about the GOVERNMENT taking
action against you for words...to a degree. You can still be fined for
slander. You can still be put in jail for, say, shouting "BOMB!" in a
crowded theater or saying you're going to kill the president.

However, this isn't the government taking action against you for
speaking. It's private citizens and businesses. The Constitution
doesn't say "Citizens can speak what they want". It says CONGRESS
shall make no law restricting free speech. THE GOVERNMENT. It doesn't
say JACK SHIT about private individuals and coorperations restricting
what you say on their property...and, when you use you're ISP, you are
on their property....
