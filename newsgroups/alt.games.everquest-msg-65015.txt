Thanks Verant - so much - I wish i had studied Law...

Don't think it is within the law to change things from playable just fine to
not playable anymore for people who don't want to buy the new (and for sure
buggggggy) Exp. (esp. not before Xmas - at least no if you have anything
called a social life) and just want to contiue to play what we paid for when
we bought the game and still paying for in advance.

I want to see the car dealer who is leasing me a car and whooop - after 15
months tries to tell me that I should throw away the one I paid for and now
pay again and even more then before just to be able to continue to drive.
Can you say: Out of business within a second ? I know you could.

Thanks Verant - my Intel810E was fine so far - now all I see are black boxes
instead of buffs and text - but it works just fine with DAoC - you won't see
me again.
