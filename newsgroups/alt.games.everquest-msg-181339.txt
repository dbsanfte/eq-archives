Well, until this weekend, I HADN'T seen casinos (maybe one or two, but
not a lot of spam associated with them) on Terris Thule.

But there were at least 3 and maybe even 4 going at once yesterday.  And
they were all trying to out-spam the other.  I think a couple may have
gotten together in an effort to drive a 3rd out of business.  Sheez!
