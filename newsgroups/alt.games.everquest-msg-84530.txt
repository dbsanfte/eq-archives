Thing to remember... GM's are customer service representatives, employees
with cool jobs.  That said, if the in-game "chain of command" doesn't work,
there's always the normal business chain.  Someone who treats customers
thusly will likely find themselves unemployed.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
