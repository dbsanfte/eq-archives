Actually, it's changed more than you think.

The merchant Ragefire that spawns in Sol B is no longer in Naggy's lair.  He
spawns on the little ledge just below the first two fire giants.  (24 hour
spawn, so not *too* hard to find up.   Just check every so often.)

And he no longer turns into a dragon that must be killed when you hand him
the pearl, he merely threatens you and gives you back a different pearl.

Once you have the second pearl you can talk to an NPC at the dragon statue
in Skyfire.  She will give you a container, in which you combine 4 no-drop
pearl shards, that are random rare drops from any mob in Skyfire.  Hand her
back the combined heart, and the killable Ragefire spawns, then pops the
dragon when he dies.
