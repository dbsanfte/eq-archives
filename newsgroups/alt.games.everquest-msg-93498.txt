Yes, we get an AA ability "/pet hold" that will cause the pet to attack
nothing no matter if it's getting wailed on or not.  Also, I read an article
on Mage Compendium regarding mage pets just last night, and the question
about the difference between "/pet guard me" and "/pet follow me" and the
answer was NO DIFFERENCE, but that there may have been a time when the two
commands had different results, but if so, that difference had been removed.
So basically we have 2 commands which do the same thing.  If you want to
