The ability to drop coins was removed a couple of weeks ago.
One reason was that people were scamming other people into
dropping coins when trading.

The scam went:

person selling item stands in the EC tunnel behind one of the
firepots;
person buying item starts trade by clicking *across fire* with
coin-in-hand;
game doesn't target across fire, so coins drop; and
scammer picks up coins.

The scammer, BTW, would use the 3rd person view so they
could target the coins (or the person, if requested to put
the item for sale up first) w/o having to target across the
fire.  For a "professional trader" it was an easy way to get
extra plat from newbies too stupid to wait to see the item
in the trade window before offering the coin.

At any rate, it was easier for VI to remove the ability to drop
coins than educate the users not to start transactions by
putting up the coin.  I also understand that picking up coin
about to rot would sometimes cause a person to go LD;  I'm
not sure if that problem had been fixed before, but, if not, it
was another problem fixed by removing the ability to drop
coin.
