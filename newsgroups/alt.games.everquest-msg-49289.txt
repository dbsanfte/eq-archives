    Ah, yes, the language barrier.  A challenge to be sure.  Here's
 what happened the other day.  I get a tell, in an unknown language.
 Now, unknown languages are not completely randomized; I could tell
 I was hearing from someone from the newsgroup (what else could
 "nexsgrqyp" mean, after all?).  Dave and I send several tells back
 and forth.  I found out he was in EC, he found out I was in Oasis
 on my way to the Innothule. Several of the tells had to be repeated
 to make sense.  Some never did.
     So in case you were wonder, two people without a shared tongue
 can have a conversation on FV; they just have to be patient and
 motivated.

   It was nice hearing from you Dave, even if a bit confusing.
