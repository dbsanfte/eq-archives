Two possibilities for armor:
1) Rygorr...probably bought, since your character is kind of too low to
kill the orcs that drop it

2) Ranger quest armor, ivy etched starts to become a possibility. Check out
allakhazam, and look at quests listed by zone, under kithicor for a rundown
of what is involved for each piece...there is a quest for each visible
slot.
