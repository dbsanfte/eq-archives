Why? Cats walking around on two legs aren't realistic. Why no gripe
there? Cats talking aren't realistic. Why no gripe there? Cats
swinging swords and wearing clothes aren't realistic. Cats building
cities aren't realistic. Why is the _ONLY_ gripe you have that one
trivial detail?

Besides, have you ever seen "furry" art? There's a LOT of artists out
there who "look stupid" if giving female anthropomorphic animals only
2 breasts when the "real" animals have more makes them look stupid.

Get over it. You're obsessing over something that is...well...stupid.
You're crying for realism when there's so many other LARGER deviations
from reality. Above all, you're calling for realism in a FANTASY GAME.
