Two heads and not a cogent thought from the pair of them. Have you thought
of investing in a third that isn't used solely for keeping your ears apart?

Yes, he was always Ron Green and to you maybe it wasn't a secret, but I had
no idea what his real name was. Neither did I care, except for the fact it
seemed to slow his flames down a little.

Your post seems totally worthless, apart from the fact it quotes very nicely
for bizbee to respond, which was your motive all along, wasn't it?
