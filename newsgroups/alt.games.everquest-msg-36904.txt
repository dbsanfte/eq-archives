The only Spirocs that can cast are the "warriors" .. Other than that,
they're all warrior-class, and a few are rogues ..

I've had it happen when pulling brownies in LFay, too, so it's not limited
to Kunark and Velious. The good thing about the gating thing is that you're
usually wiped off their hate list, so they won't bring friends if you get
too close. =)
