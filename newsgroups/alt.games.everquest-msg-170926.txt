I know of one clicky clarity that can be used by a necro. It has one charge,
it's called clarifying spores, and I have no clue where they drop. I know
the 4 sets of pants and rod that cast clarity cannot be used by a
non-enchanter.

Drakkel Wolf Claws proc Wandering Mind, which has a 6 mana per tick
recourse, and would stack with lich. 8k in the bazaar. But they have a
required level of 51. There is a Theft of Thought proccing dagger that is
necro usable, but, well, it looks like it probably drops in Vex Thal.

Go to lucy.fnord.net and type in the spell name you are interested in. You
will see in the description 'items that have this spell'

Flowing Thought items are your best bet.
