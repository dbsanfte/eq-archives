You'd be surprised how easy it is to do that with just a little bit of
lag. The snare that Wizzies get is AE. You cast, monster walks towards
you with lag. Bam. Also, there are some weird targetting issues. For
example when I engage a mob, and suddenly my SOW drops, I take a quick
drag from my blood of the wolf. Now if I don't remember that casting
that automatically targets me (and i forget about 10% of the time) the
next spell I cast will land on me... since I didn't do anything to
change target. Common Wizard annoyance. My favourite is rooting myself
when soloing - it's like a death sentence.
