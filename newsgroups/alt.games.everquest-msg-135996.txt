The only spell excluded under Mana Preservation III items are Complete Heal
and anything that you have another mana reduc item for that's of greater
value (Summoning Efficiency III, Reanimation Efficiency III, Affliction
Efficiency III) in which case you get the higher mana reduction value of the
Efficiency effect.

Also, your Mana Preservation I item only works on spells up to level 20.
