CHeal isn't really all that important other than for a heavy duty MA taking
some major damage.  As a cleric, I find Celestial Elixer and Remedy
get cast a lot more than CHeal, and before that (from 44 to low 50s) Celestial
Healing and Superior Heal.

CHeal only seems massively more effective when your target has a buttload
of HP and has taken massive amounts of damage.  If you aren't healing
3khp at a time you are probably better off with another plan.

The HOT line does very nicely at healing ordinary damage on ordinary
tanks, or on anyone in the party (or raid) who -isn't- taking the massive
damage (say getting heavy riposte hits or AOE damage instead)

Remedy is fast, cheap, and does the job fine where damage isn't heavy

Neither has anywhere near the aggro problems or the slow cast times
of CHeal.

Group heals are also quite effective in some circumstances, although oddly
the high level ones are not as efficient as Heroic Bonds... which brings
up another topic:

HP buffs, the clerical ones double as very low aggro heals and can be more
mana efficient at many levels than any heal in the book.  Druid line doesn't
work this way, which frankly sucks for you.

What CHeal does is let clerics be the healers on serious serious situations...
and oddly lets them do it half decently at outrageously low levels.  I grouped
with a 60 warrior at the tender level of 40 at one point, and since my mana
regen rate wasn't much worse than a 60 cleric (back then there was no BAOR
or C3 or FT items, so all a 60 cleric would have over me would be his
higher meditation skill) but my exp cost to the warrior was almost nonexistant
(this was before the exp change so exp split was based on exp totals rather
than levels)

IMO CHeal should be a level 49 cleric spell, since its pretty much useless
on sub 50 tanks, what on earth it was doing in the preKunark game I have
no idea... except that of course back then there was also no Celestial
Healing...

For Druids to be healers, I'd lower the levels at which they get their heals,
and then add a couple high end heals, preferably ones with a unique flavor;
clerics have the HOT line, shaman have a similar line that costs less mana
but has the snare/slow drawback, druids should get one that does something
else quirky, like put a MOR or MOK on the target...or something non HOT
based could be added that comes from some other creative angle.

Hmm, another strategy occurs to me, drastically improve their Regen line.
Regen is basically a very long but not very high rate HOT, after all, its
merely inadequate at higher levels as the mobs damage output goes
up far faster than the regen HP output.  Regen is a fabulous PL tool
and functional in a low damage situation... if the HP output was
doubled it might push druids over the edge into real healer territory

Simply duplicating class defining spells from other classes isn't really a
very exciting fix.
