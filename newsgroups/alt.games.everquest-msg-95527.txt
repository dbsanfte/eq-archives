Well, maybe not exactly risk-free.  But the time I saw it Velks was
overcrowded and I was in a "let's group and kill some spiders here
since every camp is full" group.  So the only risk was the shaman
(can you say: barbarian?) who kept training 3 or 4 at a time to the
zone because he couldn't pull worth a damn.  Since he had a tendency
to run over my group instead of the wiz, her only risk was going LD or
having a really big lag spike.

Who avoids bullshit little exploits because he knows that some day
he's gonna lose it and tell a few of those brain-damaged morons he
meets just what he thinks of them, and he wants a clean record when
the GM comes to talk to him about it.
