: My evidence for the decrease in rent can be found at clarkhoward.com:

I went there, what section specifically mentions this?  Evidence of rents
*increasing* where I live (as well as the cost of homes) can be found at
www.signonsandiego.com  just type in "rent increases" and hit go, as well as
with my land lord, if you would like the phone # to verify the *significant*
increase I have incurred please email me privately.  I can also provide you
with 20 months of receipts.  I can also furnish you with *several* copies of
San Diego's Apartment Guide, a monthly publication which documents the ever
increasing rents here, I don't think it's available on line, if I find that
it is I will repost.

As I said in my previous post, I have *nothing* to do with California
politics, (many military families who live here do not) yet we still suffer
the consequences of their decisions--what you said was

" The cost of electrical power in california has gone up
substantially largely due to an incompetent populace electing the same type
of leaders."

My reply was "It doesn't make the fucking electric bill any less."  Which is
to say that regardless of the finger pointing, the people are still the ones
paying.  There are a lot of us who had nothing to do with California
politicians and their decision to deregulate,  and yet we pay, and pay, and
pay...the fact that we are forced to do so does not make us incompetent.

Too, you failed to mention where you live.  Please do so in your next post
if you would.  Thanks~
