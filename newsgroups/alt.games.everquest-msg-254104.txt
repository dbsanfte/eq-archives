My barbarian berzerk found it possible to run the everfrost tunnel into 
BB, but a bit difficult, and often resorted to a blown up map and 
playing "move the arrow".  THe Surefall/QH tunnel was a bit better, 
which amuses me because I recall finding playing a human ranger nearly 
impossible due to the difficulty of navigating the Surefall Tunnel... to 
get out to the QH to fight and back in to Surefall to train!

I haven't taken my berserker to Tox yet, but I definately recall playing 
an erudite mage long ago and finding the forest nearly impossible to 
play in during the night, couldn't see anything at all except the names 
over the mob's heads.  Moved to Qeynos and never looked back.

Played puller with the barbarian in a Mistmore group yesterday, running 
mobs from as far away as just in front of the Dark Huntress to back at 
the foot of the zone entrance ramp; at night this was an amazing stumble 
thru a barely lit set of tight curves, still doable but bad enough that 
getting an IR from a passing shaman was a definate boost.

I'll have to look into getting an IR or better item sometime, because it 
does help... but its no longer crippling
