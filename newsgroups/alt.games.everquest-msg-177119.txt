Given that description and goal I'd say that either Ben's suggestion:
Shaman+Cleric+Shadowknight+Rogue(or substitute other damage dealer)
or perhaps:
Shaman+Enchanter+Paladin+Rogue|Ranger|Monk|BL

If you were going to be on a regular server I'd say the first wins
hands down because KEI is available very nearly 24x7, the Shaman
can (eventually) cover haste, the Shaman and Cleric can share CC
duties (you won't fare too well against multiple casters without
an Enchanter tho, that's one significant limitation), and the SK
outdamages a Paladin while holding agro just as well (he can't
heal for beans, but you'd have a Cleric backed up by Shaman so
that's not important).

If you play on a server where you can't just assume that KEI is
available anytime you want it (it's often being offered on FV,
but not all the time) then the second choice is more attractive
because when you add mana regen to superior haste and first
class crowd control the Enchanter looks very very very good.

Note that high level Rogues looking for groups seem pretty rare
(they've all given up by then, I guess), so there is definitely an
attraction to having a Rogue in your group should you decide you'd
like to mess with certain dungeons.
