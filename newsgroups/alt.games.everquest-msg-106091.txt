Yeah, but in that case its always funny they say bixies in particular.
I tested this and can tell you that for a fact its not really true. I
was in EC once late at night with my wood elf druid and ONLY killing
bixies TO TRY to get griffons to spawn for me to kill. No one else was
around killing random spawns. After three hours of some auctioning and
such and killing every bixie that ever popped on track, I HAD ZERO
GRIFFONS SPAWN. So I can say that for a fact the sentence, 

"killing bixies in EC causes Griffons to spawn."

Is likely an untrue sentence.

So now on characters I'll kill bixies in front of other people just to
watch them freak, "you fool, that will make griffons spawn!" Yeah,
sure, and there is anti camp code!
