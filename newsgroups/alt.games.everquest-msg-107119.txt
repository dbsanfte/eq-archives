Not just this thread (but I do seem to recall more than one mention of
'giving druids and shamans CH is unbalancing!' (duh, yes?) in this
thread :) )

And my point is: Do you think that getting a slight tweak to what you
CAN do at raids would be so drastic that clerics and warriors should
get more solo skills? Even if it were just a tweak comparable to their
better solo abilities now that warriors have better weapons and high
end clerics have better nukes. (They still can't solo better than 50
druids can kill Yelinak, but an improvement is an improvement :p )

True.

Thing is, there are plenty of characters nowadays that were
powerleveled through 1-50 in a month. It doesn't seem fair to hold
leveling ease against druids anymore, especially since a lot of the
speedkiting masses seem to be the ones that end up using their druid
to farm and to PL up their 'needed' class they want for raiding.
I'm a raiding druid, and it took me from janauary to august to reach
50, with 20 days played. I was in groups almost all the time, so my
edge was mostly in not having to look for ports when I wanted a change
of scenery, and in not having the patience to camp much. Not all of us
follow the very quickest way to 50 route even though we play one of
the easiest classes to get there with.

One or maybe two reasonable requests, yes.
