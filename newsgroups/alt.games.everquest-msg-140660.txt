That'll do, thankyou...still doesn't explain how the Asslings got it tho.

I'll use Scott's suggestion and create my own.

After a night eating far too much pie and consuming excessive amounts of
ale, one, destined for greatness, Assling passed gas with such force that he
achieved a velocity that hadn't been seen by a short race since Proon won
the, last ever, annual Gnome Punting contest with a kick that left Gnome
splatterings all over Antonious Bayles Palace wall, not bad considering the
contest is held in Eastern Karana. It was following said kick that Gnome
punting became outlawed in the Qeynos controlled lands.
Back to our story, the flatulent Halfling had the presence of mind to cast
his Ring of Misty Spell but was travelling so fast that he had reached the
moon of Luclin before it completed, this resulted in a permanent link for
those of Druidic Magic access Luclin from Norrath as if any other Druid
ring...although the journey is accompanied by a strange smell.
