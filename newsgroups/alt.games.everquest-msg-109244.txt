it also means *nothing* for casters drops in ST anymore, so those clerics
and shamans working their asses off at Brood killings, going to ST week in
week out, do it for *no* chance of reward.

Also as well as the mask you mentioned, theres several other 'warder only'
loot that is gone for ever.

SoD's, monk bp's, resistance stones, (I dunno what caster loot there was,
but i know they had some) are all lost for ever once the sleeper is woken,
as well as from 6-9 primals, to 1-3 primals if your lucky nowadays
