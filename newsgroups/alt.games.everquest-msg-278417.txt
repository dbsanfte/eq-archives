I think the opposite side of the "too easy" coin is that WoW never
feels like a grind.  Usually what happens is that I go off, spend a
session doing part of a quest (or maybe a couple of quests, depending)
and then am pleasantly surprised when I see that I've gotten some
experience.  I'm never staring at my experience bar, wondering if I'm
going to see it move a pixel after then next kill.

Overall what appeals to me is that it seems like Blizzard got "the
little things" right.  For example, travel.  When EQ decided to make
travel easier, they just implemented insta-ports.  As people have
said, you lose the sense of the Everquest world.  In WoW, you can fly
places, but you have to visit there first, and the flights take
time... in some cases, a LOT of time. 

The shared bank vs. mailing stuff to alts is another case where I
think Bliizzard just got it right.
