My alt is a lvl 25 bard  on the Nameless that I play as casually as
possible.  Although, I find myself getting more addicted to him as he
progresses.    He is not Uber twinked but does have SS Boots, 25 AC
chest and a couple of fast weapons.  I'm looking for a new challenge
within the criteria below.  

--Been everywhere on the classic Norath.  So something in one of the
expansions please.
--I'm currently in LoIO just because I lacked creativity, so not there
please
--My wizard has been been through Marus Seru & Dawnshroud so I'd
rather not go back, but
--The wizard only did wandering creatures as he learned to quad so if
there is an interesting camp, I'd still consider it.
-- My bard is way behind my normal friends so it needs to be a place
where I can solo or easily get into a pickup group.  I'm equally
comforatble with both grouping and soloing.
-- My goal is to get through the next couple of levels and have fun
doing it.  Fast XP or Plat is nice but not a requirement.

Any suggestions on how to get to this promise land would be greatly
appreciated.   
Thanks All  !!!
