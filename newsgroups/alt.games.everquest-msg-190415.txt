    Actually, if you go back and read my post, I was talking about grouping
with people of varying levels versus soloing. Not grouping with people of
various levels vs grouping with people all of the same level as you. Unless
you're being powerlevelled the difference between the two will be fairly
minimal, except that the lower levels slow the whole group down and the
higher levels take more of the experience.

    And on YOUR numbers, someone grouping with even one other person of
higher level is getting less than half the exp per kill they would recieve
per kill soloing. And duoing isn't normal grouping either. It's relatively
easy to coordinate 2 people, but when you have 6 things come apart at the
seams. Mana is wasted, dps is wasted, and you lose out vs soloing - which is
why so many people solo. Your experiences in the hole I'm sure are
positive..... the hole has about the highest non-pop ZEM in the game. You
could have the worst group in the world there and if it still made kills
you'd make shitloads of experience.

    And I say again your powerlevelling example is a load - powerlevelling
isn't your average group. I wasn't talking about reds and yellows, but a
normal group, where people team up to kill large numbers of mobs which are
blue to everyone in the group. Most grouping situations do not involve reds,
and almost no pickup group will grab a player for whom the mobs are red or
yellow if they're hunting blues.

    But a relatively crap one compared to soloing, unless its a particularly
GOOD duo teamwork and tactics wise. With six people you randomly selected
from folks LFG in a zone (which is how most groups, and certainly the
average group comes about) you aren't going to get anywhere near the
efficiency of doing it yourself.

    I always thought that a group of six people should be able to ordinarily
handle red con mobs single pulled all day - and this might be true in some
cases, but it just isn't viable in the reality of the game. It's extremely
difficult to single pull red cons to begin with, and they tend to resist all
the vital spells groups use to make the fight swing their way every time.
Simply the high number of fights required to make a level means that sooner
or later, cutting it that fine will result in quite a few deaths - and
people generally aren't up for the risk of losing out.

    The only point you've managed to make is that in my example the level 40
will level first. Well, they have almost half the experience required so
you'd bloody well hope they would - but their progress, if not EXACTLY
matched to the 48, will be close enough to be an absolute and utter pain in
the ass compared to grouping with a bunch of late 30's consistently and
quickly killing early-mid 30's mobs.
