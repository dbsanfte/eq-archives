Again I must say "thank you for the info."  I *KNOW* I'm not anywhere 
near ready to go to the various planes, other than PoK, but it never 
hurts to have a little bit of foreknowledge about some of this stuff.

Besides, one of my playing partners has some high(er) level chars, and he 
tends to help me out insofar as where to go and what to do.  

Having only started the game in July of this year, I suppose I'm on a 
personal quest to know as much as I can about the content, areas (I'm 
sorry - "ZONES"), and NPCs as I can get into my brain.

Now, after rambling, Balanof and I bow out to once again lurk in the 
shadows, waiting for that one quick backstab that ends the miserable life 
of some unknown MOB.

Balanof E'Ci 21 Rogue.  (Notice I spelled it right?)
