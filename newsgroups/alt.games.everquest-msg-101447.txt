jkraft1003@hotmail.com (Joe Kraft) had the moxy to write:

> Just for reference, how much is DAoC, AO, UO, and AC a month?

I haven't played EQ recently, and I just popped in to read the moaning 
about the rate hike. DAoC and AO are both $13 a month with discounts for 
bulk rates, so EQ is essentially just coming up to the level of the 
competition. I'm playing AO right now because it fits my playstyle, 
hardware, and mood better than EQ right now, but both are good games. Tried 
DAoC the first month, bored the hell out of me. Never played AC. And of 
course, UO is still kicking, what with the new Blackthorn expansion. Is it 
still $10?

I think it will be interesting to see if there's a mass exodus based on 
this rate hike. Somehow I think the total number of accounts will probably 
drop (as more casual players decide to drop off) while the number of people 
concurrently playing will rise (as less casual players decide they need to 
put in more time in the game to justify the added cost). I admit this 
prediction was pulled right out of my ass.
