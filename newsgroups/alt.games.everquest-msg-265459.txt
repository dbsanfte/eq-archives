Huh?  How are resists against magic any different than armor against melee
attacks?

I haven't seen that problem in DAoC, so your "every other game" claim is a
bit over the top.

Just like with resists, player housing can work great, or totally suck,
depending on the design.  Considering that there are examples going both
ways in other games, there is no particular reason to believe that the EQ2
team will screw this up.

It depends on what the purpose of housing is.  I did hang out in my DAoC
house, because I had a vault there that could be used to share items with
my alts and my friends, and I had a forge and a weaponsmithing merchant in
my house for my alt that was doing weaponsmithing.

I often visit the housing zone, because that's where player's consignment
merchants are.
