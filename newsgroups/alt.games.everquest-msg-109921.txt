GENERAL FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q: Does agility affect running speed? I've noticed people with a agi of
96 tend to out distance me my agi is 90.

A:You must be seeing things, or perhaps over burdened. The only thing
which
affects your running speed is your weight and any movement haste or slow
spells which are in effect on you.


Stick that in you halucinatory pipe and smoke it.

HTH,
