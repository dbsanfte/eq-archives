I am returning to Everquest after a prolonged absence and was hoping
that some of you guys could help me out by answering a few questions.
First off, I haven't played EQ for around 18 months. I played for
around 9 months before and started a new job, moved flat and with new
ISP/time restraints playing EQ became impractical. Anyway, now
everything has settled a little I decided to get back into the MMORPG
thing, and after a brief dalliance with DaoC decided I had better do
the right thing and get back to Norrath. EQ should be arriving here
any day soon (as I lost my original game CDs) and I can't wait to
start playing again.

O.K. First off, I have decided to start off afresh and was looking for
server specific information. I see from looking around Everlore and
EQVault server numbers are no longer published publicly. Is there
anyway of finding out the number of people on a server at any one
time? I am looking to play on a reasonably young, low population,
non-PvP server and was hoping someone here could point me in the right
direction.

Also, I notice that there have been many changes, too many to go into
detail here, and was wondering if there have been any changes that
would mean any one character is not worth playing. I don't want a
debate (i.e. Druids vs. Necros) but would like to know if some
characters have been so nerfed they're not worth playing anymore in
the high-end etc. Perhaps Necromancers now can't kite eight yellow
cons to them at once etc. Unfair I know ;) One other thing: is it just
me or do Erudites now have pointy heads? Please tell me it isn't soï¿½

That's it. I look forward to hearing your replies. Thanks!!!
