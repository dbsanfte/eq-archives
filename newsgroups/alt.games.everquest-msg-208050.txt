If your into solo'in, what druid is not from time to time, kite the guard at
the Lava entrance in Nek forrest.  It has about a 6 minute spawn time, Sow
yourself of course, snare him and DD him with you ignite spell.  You can kite
by running up and down the canyon, the Lava zone line is close if you get in
trouble.  This is newbie dark elf hunting ground so you might from time to time
catch some flak from the dark elves.  Unless they are trained to zone line, no
other guards will be around, watch for the high level dragoon if you see other
guards being trained, other than that it is a safe camp, can get to 19 spells
with it.  It drops no coin, DE guards are poorly paid I guess, but a 2pp+ sword
is dropped every time.

regards,
John
