The new expansion went really smoothly for me, except for one bizarre 
occurrence... I'm using the latest version of Xymarra's wonderful UI (
grab it from www.eqinterface.com. I don't get a commission), and I've 
never had a problem with it. At one random moment, yesterday, while I 
was typing, the interface was unloaded. All windows disappeared, and all 
I was left with was the black borders of the viewport. I gated to a safe 
location, quit and restarted, and this seemed to fix the problem, but 
many of the windows appeared to have been messed with... Their position 
and transparency settings had been reset, and their "lock" enabled.

Strange... If this hasn't happened to anybody else, all I can think of 
is that I may have inadvertently typed in an undocumented /buggerupui 
command or another.
