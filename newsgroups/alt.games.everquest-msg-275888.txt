I 'depend' on my computer for many functions. That doesn't mean they 
should be included. I have special requirements requiring special tools. 
I pay for them.

DNS costs <200.00. You are getting off pretty lightly.

And I paid nearly 200.00 for my keyboard and mouse. They came with 
drivers to extend the operating system to properly support them. Sure MS 
came with basic support, but I'm still out 200 bucks. So the basic 
support really didn't get me anywhere.

Why? I don't need it. I don't want to pay the licensing for it.

I shelled out several hundred more for a monitor. Your not enhancing 
your argument very well here. Blind people can get away with a used 
$50.00 15" monitor used only for when sighted friends need to 
troubleshoot something... us sighted people routinely shell out 500+ for 
a decent monitor.

You still need peripherals.

That is the function of a corporation operating in a capitalism. If you 
don't like it you'll have to change the American government first.

His obligation to his shareholders is to enrich them, not carve 
favourable historical epithets for himself.

*Basic* input and output is an operating system function. Let me 
emphasize that word again *BASIC*.

Most people think the Internet browser is the worst thing about windows. 
The media player? 2nd worst thing. Media editor? Lol... who seriously 
uses windows movie maker?

Windows includes some shovelware, big deal. I don't use any of it. 
(Well... IE is so entrenched into the OS you really can't entirely avoid 
using it, but bad windows architecture isn't the topic of discussion...
