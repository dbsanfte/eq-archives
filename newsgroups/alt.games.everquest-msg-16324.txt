Kilmir answered the first question.

When I first created my magician in 4/99 (level 25 now :) ) it was my 2nd
character (my first was only level 10 or so) so I couldn't twink with cash,
and quest stuff was unknown, and there wasn't much demand for bat wings or
bone chips.  My point was, I was broke.  It took me to level 6 to afford my
level 4 spells, and level 10 for my level 8s!

I could only afford one pet.  I chose the air elemental.  Stun isn't as good
as root, but when it comes to running away, screaming like a schoolgirl,
it's good enough.

It was also nice (looking back...since I really didn't have anything to
compare it to) not to see "Taunting Attacker, Master" when you THOUGHT the
pet was right behind you but in fact is half the zone away.

I bought fire as well, but they died too fast and malachites were EXPENSIVE
(hey, 8s is a LOT of money when you can't afford your spells as it is).
