As a pure caster you will always be wearing a robe. There are many
different robes in the game. If you see another caster in a robe you
like the looks of, ask them about it. Some are easier to get than
others, and some are more expensive than others.

If you want to ditch the robe look cast your level 4 Illusion Half-Elf
spell. This will give you infra-vision (see at night) as well as
removing the robe. (Half-Elves do not have a robe graphic)

Weapons are not a big issue for pure casters. You will find MUCH
better items to hold in your hands as you level (Idols, Stiens, etc).
These will improve on your primary stats (+INT, +CHAR, and +Mana
items.) All of these items will need to be equiped in your primary,
secondary, or range weapon slots. Once you get up past level 10 it
will be suicide for you to stand toe-to-toe with any creature you are
fighting, so don't worry too much about weapons. As a pure caster your
weapons are your spells and  your pet (if your class uses one).

Cheers
