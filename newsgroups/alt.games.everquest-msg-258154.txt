Charm is an exception on at least some mobs, as the amount of DPS it adds 
is significant, unlike that animation.

As to the boredom problem, try raiding with 6 other shaman there.  You 
can play race the raid to get a nuke in before the trash mobs are dead.  
Usually I end up patch healing on the boss mobs, futzing around trying to 
hit trash mobs with nukes, and doing the odd rebuff.  Slows on the trash 
mobs are pretty pointless for the most part.
