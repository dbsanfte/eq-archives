Well, the wife and I have been hunting in the Warrens, and well its
greening out rather quick like... and after checking at eqatlas we
tried Netherian Lair... (she did not like the LONG run to the zone for
the emergency bailout)....
any suggestions... and we are trying to stay away from the usual
haunts.... LoIO... etc... the quietness of the warrens was rather
refreshing.
Not sure if it helps but My necro is an Erud, and her warrior is a
Dwarf.
As usual, your time is appreciated.
