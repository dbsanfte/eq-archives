I have also had necros prefer to let my druid snare as the darkness line
is more expensive also.  The best thing to do is ask.  Ask any other
class who you "share" spell types with.  IE mr shaman will you SoW the
group or shall I, Hey fellow druid which dot's are you casting.  Shall I
nuke or dot, and so on.  Communication is always key.  I will also tell
my group, hey my snare is being resisted, etc, and let someone else
attempt it, rather than burn through all my mana.  That is another that
works well, to save the necro some mana, the druid/ranger acts as
primary snarer, if they get more than say 3 resists on snare, say
resist, and then the necro can attempt it, or vice versa.
