A stack of summoned water is useful to someone unable to smmon themselves
- you buffed him, he buffed you back...maybe it was all he could do or
spare (that is the point of donations - a voluntary UNREQUIRED offering)

Sorry but I construe someone disguising selling stuff under the 'Im a
charitable guy' tag of 'donations accepted' as being far far more abusive.
And you are making assumptions about the other person - if 5cp is all the
liquid cash they have in the world its all the liquid cash they can afford
- if a buff is all they think your buff is worth as a thank you so be it -
its not like you are selling KEI if you ask for donations.

I have no problem with someone wanting cash for a port or a KEI or
anything really in fact so long a they are open about it. If they say
donations I give a donation based on how much they helped me, how nice
they are, how much cash they seem to have garnered, how much I have on the
character (or could easily get if its all in the bank) and a host of
other very qualitative things....

If I offer stuff for donations I assume I may get nothing - regular
returnees obviously stacking up their kit yet never bothering to make an
offer wont get the buffs I offer unless Im open buffing (and then its
anyone). To be honest people who ask politely and act like it not their
right to have my attention are far more likely to get my help and so on
than people who are rude but drop stacks of cash (well to a point someone 
who was blunt and arrogant but offered 2k for some buffs probably would
get them but you get the idea).

Right so in fact you are a KEI vendor trying to advertise on the sly by
pretending to be uncaring about receiving the mone when in fact it is the
money that is your primary reason for doing it.

Sorry but I frankly find that far more of an abuse than any small timer
grabbing a cheeky KEI.

This is far far better. Open, honest - achieves what you want and makes it
plain to others. Your price isnt bad either.
