Gear is usually skill restricted, and not level restricted in my experience, 
with a caveat. In order to equip an item or scribe a scroll (spell or combat 
art) you need to meet the skill requirement of the item with respect to a 
particular skill. If you open up your skill page it looks pretty similar to 
the one in EQ1 with a few dozen different skills and such, but instead of 
Conjuration 70 and Alteration 90 you have things like Reconnaissance 70/70, 
Magic Affinity 100/100, Light Armor 65/65, Medium Armor 80/80, Heavy Armor 
100/100 etc. (current/max). A piece of armor will have some kind of armor 
type skill associated with it, limiting it to players within a narrow range.

It's kind of a phony deal right now tho because you gain 5 pts in all your 
key skills automatically every level so it effectively is level restricted. 
You can generally tell when you can use something by dividing the skill 
requirement by 5. And the artifical skilling up that occurs to all of your 
key skills at regular intervals (people call them mini-dings), is a joke. 
Why would I suddenly gain increases in Staves as a result of gaining exp 
from a quest that had nothing to do with Staves, and why all of them at 
once? I suspect the reason is because they haven't really implemented the 
system they intend yet, the existing skill behaviors probably are 
placeholders for what will come.

Even better.

The problem will become more acute with the alleged dependencies that are 
supposed to be coming. I hate this idea. I'm already looking at what it will 
take to 2-box an Alchemist and Sage (which is one of the reasons I took 
Alchemy this time around).
