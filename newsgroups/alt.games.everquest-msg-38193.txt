Yes, under thirty, we are generally still believing the write up in the
manual (masters of damage my ass), and when a magician and his pet are out
damaging us by leaps and bounds, we tend to try and over compensate.  (I've
seen a magician pet out damage a ranger of slightly higher level than the
magician).

Part of the wizard problem is a lack of superior nukes (over Magicians)
until into the 30's... and TRUELY superior nukes until into the 40's.  This
contributes to the undesirability of Wizards in those early, "formative"
levels.

So under 30 that "kill shot" attack can be done about equally well by a
wizard or a magician.  But the magician brings a spare tank with him in the
form of the pet.  Ergo "Wizards are useless, see!" Except that a wizard
won't stand up and say "hey, where's my pet?" five seconds before you get
trained... and a Wizard's higher mana efficiency means less downtime after
burning a mob (I might only do ten points more damage... but I do it with
ten points less mana).  Under 30 the margin is narrow... but later on (where
Verant has been trying to balance us) that margin becomes rather large.

I was in a group some time ago... three wizards... a rogue (who had a wizard
alt)... a cleric... and an enchanter.  The cleric logged off at one point
(after being FOM through four pulls)... and we didn't notice for about two
hours.  The rogue pulled intentional trains a couple of times, so she could
get to melee and get one of her combat skills up a little bit.
