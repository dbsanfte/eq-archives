Don't you love these kind of posts.. somedays I just can't resist and have
to bite on the trolls. Let's see... I'm 30, relatively pale (since I live
where it rains from November to April), and while I may not be height/weight
proportionate (6'4"/250#) I play competitive rugby (which means I run or go
to the gym every day), used to throw people out of bars for a living (until
I got a decent government job - now I crawl in and out of ships looking for
bugs amongst other things) - and no, I never took a steroid in my life (yet
one more stereotype shot to hell). But then again, I only play maybe 10-20
hours a week... so I guess I'm just not the typical EQ player...

But DT was right... it looked like a fairly average cross-section of people
in Seattle... some overweight, some not, some tanned, some not. But since I
don't have to see through coke-bottle thick glasses to look at the pictures,
I was unable to distort the pictures so they all looked pale and
overweight... time for you to get your prescription changed bud...<shrug>
