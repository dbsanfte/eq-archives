Don't be absurd.

Over the long haul that's exactly what happens. But those who deserve
it most should get it *first*.

You're making an argument I never supported. Stop. I said its more
likely that the guild would benefit from having the L60 MT have a top
end BP than a L52 cleric who is basically nothing but a walking CH
aggromagnet with less mana than everyone else and who can't buff
anyone.

You can make all the exception arguments you like, the odds are still
in favor of the L60 having done more.

Yes. But still on merit. Equip all the tanks as best you can, with the
longest serving and most guild oriented tanks getting the best stuff
first.

I get the feeling those of you who like random very rarely actually
get anything worth having. Merit works best with guilds who do a lot
of raiding, have a lot of success, and get a lot of loot to pass
around.
