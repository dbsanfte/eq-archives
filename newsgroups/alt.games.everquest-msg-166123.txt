The only real thing I see as something you should definitely look into is a
new processor.  Every time I've run EQ on a machine with any type of Celeron
processor, the machine does not run as well.  I also suggest getting
yourself to a gig of system memory.  That was one of the best things I ever
did for my machine running EQ.   You might also want to look at getting the
Soundblaster Audigy.  I have a machine with an Audigy and a machine with a
Live and the one with the Audigy has a lot less problems with EQ.  As far as
video, I used to only buy ATI, but about 1.5 years ago I purchased a
GeForce3 and haven't looked back at ATI since.
