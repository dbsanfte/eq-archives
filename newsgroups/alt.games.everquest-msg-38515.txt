Are you trying to be dense on purpose, or does it just come naturally
for you? I write the message in the almost certain knowledge that I'm
wasting my time.

That link you posted, did you bother to read it? It doesn't say
anywhere that a person will be banned. It says several times that an
*account* will be banned. Account, not person. Get it yet? Even a
glimmer?

Now, do you know what it is that determines an account? It's a CD key.
Nothing more. Nothing about Verant's statement in any way stops a
player from purchasing another copy of the game and starting up a new
account.
