One thing I have noticed is that certain mobs will drop a given amount of plat
for each player regardless if auto split is on or not. IOW if one player loots
he may get plat but if auto split is on all players get 3 plat. Did not work on
all Mobs but I remember testing it out in a zone a while back.
