/agree

Very full of shit. You have a lot of time to learn to play your character
since getting to level 50 takes a while and it's highly unlikely that
rangers at level 50+ are trying to be main tank or can't manage aggro, also
it would take really stupid group members to let him go ahead and do it
without correcting him.

Rangers are not mana sinks, in fact they are very efficient in a level 50
group because they have snare, can damage shield, regen, heals in between
fights etc plus high damage output.  Enchanter, Cleric, Warrior, Monk,
Rogue, Ranger is one example of a great group with really high damage
output.
