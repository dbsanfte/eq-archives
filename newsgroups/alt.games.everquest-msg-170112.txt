THIS IS NOT A FLAME!  Just want to say that for the longest time I felt the
same way as you about Rangers, but I've been grouping with one for a long
time and I personally love them, at least after level 30.  In my opinion
they replace druids perfectly.  This is not meant to start a flame war, but
I don't really care for druids.  In my opinion (and of course I could be
wrong) if you have a Wizard, Cleric, and Ranger in the group, then a druid
is virtually worthless.  And a ranger does more damage over time than a
druid does it seems and with a wizard there nuking, then the damage output
is greatly increased.  The main things I want a druid for is the SoW, and
after 30 a Ranger has that.  Of course once a Shaman is in the group as
well, then the point of a druid seems meaningless.  Plus the tracking skill
is most useful in groups for pullers, and a ranger can pull much better than
a druid, unless the druid is played REALLY well, which I have yet to see.
Of course all of this is talking just about pickup groups, when it comes to
raids (which I've not been on any 55+ raids yet) it could be totally
different, I don't know.

Anyone is welcome to disagree with me, and I'm not trying to offend anyone,
just explaining my point of view on Rangers as it has changed in the past
few months.
