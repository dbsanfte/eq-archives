Okay, well basically what it is, when a person first joins
Scientology, they are told that their problems are caused by
"engrams", painful memories that are stored in the "reactive mind"
(subconscious mind).  To get rid of these engrams, one undergoes
"auditing" (a process where one uses an "e-meter", a gadget like a lie
detector, while an "auditor" asks you questions and reads the readings
on the e-meter).  Eventually, when one has done enough auditing and
gotten rid of all these engrams, they will then become "Clear", and
supposedly have superior physical and mental abilities.  Of course,
none of this is cheap--usually auditing sessions are $100 or more per
hour.

However, once the person becomes Clear, they are told that they still
are in spiritual danger and they need to take the OT levels
(OT=Operating Thetan), after which they will supposedly have even MORE
superhuman abilities.  Of course, these upper level courses have an
even bigger price tag, running in the tens of thousands of dollars for
some levels.  

Well, when you get to the OT-3 level, you will find out that all of
our problems are caused because we are possessed by the souls of dead
space aliens.  See, about 75 million years ago, there was an evil
galactic ruler named Xenu who ruled the galaxies.  He wanted to solve
the overpopulation problem among the aliens, so he rounded up a bunch
of aliens, had them injected with an alcohol/glycol shot to paralyze
them, then had them transported to Earth in DC-8 planes.  He then had
them laid on the edges of volcanoes where they were blown up with
H-bombs.  Then the alien ghosts were captured with some kind of
flypaper type stuff, then sent to a big movie theater to watch movies
for 30 days which filled their minds with false memories.  Then the
ghosts were released and they started to clump together in groups and
then they attached themselves to people.  So the reason for people's
problems is because they have these dead aliens attached to their
bodies, and this OT-3 course will supposedly teach you how to exorcise
them.  

(Of course, after you've finished the OT-3 course, you're informed
that you STILL have dead space aliens attached to you; these were ones
that were sedated by drugs or in a coma and didn't respond to the OT-3
process, so now you have to do ANOTHER course to get rid of these
drugged aliens that are still on your body.  Then after OT-4, you
learn that you have YET MORE dead space aliens attached to you, and
you learn how to do auditing on these aliens, just like the auditing
you had done for yourself to become Clear.  The highest level one can
currently reach is OT-8; OT9-15 haven't been released yet.  Reaching
this level can easily cost about $400,000 or more, unless you join the
staff at a Scientology org, or church, where you will get free
auditing but will get paid maybe only about $100 a month salary).

If you want to find out more, probably the best web site would be
http://www.xenu.net .

Hope that helps!
