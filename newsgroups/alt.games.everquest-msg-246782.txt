Its actually pretty easy. Any web-designer worth his hourly rate can 
target html strict effortlessly. It only gets hard if the web designer 
is using FrontPage or something which can't emit good html in the first 
place.

(Granted some 'multi-media-experience' websites really want to push the 
envelope of what can be done on the web so they aren't (and perhaps 
shouldn't be strict... and its ok to require IE and 40 plug-ins... but 
if you are trying to perform a useful function... say like amazon.com or 
ebay.com then forgoing the flash and going for the functionality is 
going to pay off in the long run.

Since XP's ability to remove access to IE, the number of people who 
opted to do that is non-trivial. Yeah its still there... but its not 
exactly ready to go.

True, and the vast majority of sites fall into html transitional which 
is looser than strict and lets you get away with more. But the vast 
majority of browsers are perfectly fine with that. You say yourself you 
run firefox... you know from experience that very few websites choke on 
it. And that is because they don't go out of their way to do something 
that is deeply microsoft/IE proprietary... like ActiveX.
