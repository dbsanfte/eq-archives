While we can certainly continue, it's pointless. We can stop right there
and conclude that you are an idiot and a grief player if the above is
true. (However, that's in doubt as you will see below, since you don't
understand a couple of fundamental points of game mechanics)

Roleplaying is *not* an excuse, either under the rules, or in commonly
accepted player etiquette, to violate the PNP (which is only needed in
the case of assholes like you).  In fact, it is specifically called out
on Sony's home page as a "don't bother to try this lame excuse" example
given in that section.

Ah, so you like getting help from other players. I see.

Casting invis on yourself won't do shit to the hate list of the mobs, as
they see through any type of invis once you're on the hate list. So this
is obviously only for the purpose of griefing other players.

Again...... asshole.

Except those of us who travel with a continual state of see invis on. I
am simply drooling at the thought that you might be on my server and
pull that crap in sight of my necro.
