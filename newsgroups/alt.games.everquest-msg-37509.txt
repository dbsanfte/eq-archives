Thank you for reinforcing my point about wasting breath trying to explain it
to you.

The BIGGEST problem with Wizards:
Too damn few of us know how to play them.

Since I learned...

I have NEVER been lower mana than the Cleric... Except in situations were
the choice was me emptying my blue bar, or the cleric emptying his (trains,
ridiculous adds, etc...)

Fights ALWAYS end faster than if I don't fight.

And down time?  What down time?  I'm good to go for a normal fight with my
mana at 40%... 60% for a probable add... 80% in a high mulitple add area...
100% if I'm probably going to have to solo one of the adds.  I know of no
other caster that will fight at as low a mana level as mine.

Oh, wait... since I can't get a @#$%ing group because of nimrods like you
who think we're useless, and nimrods who play wizards using the "blast blast
blast" school of mob fighting... I have a LOT of down time because I have to
solo every damn thing, and don't have anything EXCEPT mana to fight with.
