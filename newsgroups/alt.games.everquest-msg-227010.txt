Planes are the best. If you think it sucks its because you're not fighting
high enough level stuff. Go to PoD and kill Underbulks (lv 60) and thats
good exp. I prefer PoI because the pulls are very easy and the respawn is
fast, but I can duo GY with shaman/monk (51/52). If you have a chanter and
good enough DPS to outpace respawn then crawl down the left side till you
get to clearing, then go to right where theres a door. Inside that room are
higher level mobs which is much better exp. Of course Factory is even better
than that if you can get in. PoN unless you're on other side of river it
sucks. Hobgoblins are a good camp. Wraith and Bansee trash is much better
than trash near GY. Guardians (lv65) and Consorts (lv63) are very good exp
even at 65. Once you get to tier 2-3 (PoV, HoH, CoD, BoT) planes exp is
easily the best over LDoN any time.
