What remains contested though is exactly where this threshold lies. It seems
to differ for different stats.
I've been told that boosting your sta above 100 prevents a certain penalty.
I've been told that you can never have enough Dex, now I read that dex over
175 is pretty much useless.

Either way it would suck as I just invested 12k in dex gear (although I did
also get some nice ac and stats boosts and some saves)
