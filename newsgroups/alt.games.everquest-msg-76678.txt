Uhm, no, he directed it pretty solidly at druids (which is kind of ironic, since I
find 9 times out of 10 if I get trained by a quad kiter, it's a wizzy, not a
druid.)  /shrug  Bottom line, it's bad to train people, m'kay, whatever class you
may be. That said, you would think that by the time they hit 50 or so, people
would have learned not to med sitting on the train tracks. Sometimes because of
lag you don't see that person until you are almost on top of them. That is not the
quad kiters fault. And yes, if some jackass screwed up my quad and got me killed
on purpose, I would /petition them. You can theoretically get your account banned
on PvE servers for intentionally causing another players death out of spite
(although I doubt GMs do it often.)
