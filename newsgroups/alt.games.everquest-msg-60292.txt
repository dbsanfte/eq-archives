Most are over in the USA at Verant but they have Antonious Bayle as the
new Euro server and that is located in Europe (UK I think).

EQ is a not a game where low ping makes vast differences like in a FPS, so
long as the ping is reasonable and the connect is solid and reliable that
more important. I never had that problem on Torvonnilous unless it got
real busy. I moved to Antonious Bayle myself for guild reasons...getting
people on at the same time as me etc, and avoiding issues like the
Atlantic link going down etc(pretty rare for that sort of split) rather
than a need for better connection though I do see that. The better
connection helps a little in zones like EC where there is vast auction
activity but for solo hunting in quiet areas doesnt affect gameplay
noticeably.
