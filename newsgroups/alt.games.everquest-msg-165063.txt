Wah wah wah

Stop whining!  You chose to camp it.

Its a very popular item, so its entry rate has to be restricted.  Make it a
raid target?  For what level set?  60+?  You then just prevented every level
40 non-twink from ever getting a shot at them.

Under 60?  I could solo it, a lot of people could (and pharm the crap out of
it)

You seem to be under the illusion your OWED jboots.. and your a druid?  lol.
If you want something similar that bad, go buy tboots!

I tried to camp it before, without luck.  I bought tboots and didn't think
about it again.  Then 1 saturday morning I was in Oasis saying hi to some
people from this newsgroup.  As I ran to sro to meet my wizzy for a port,
guess who I bumped into!

I wasn't looking for him, I was in the zone all of 5 mins, and I got the
ring :)
