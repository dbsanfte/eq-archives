This isn't a benefit, it is a substantial penalty. In a classless, skill
based system where stats related to the ability to perform various skills,
humans would rock.

But since you can tailor your class and race together to get optimal stats
(such as they matter at all), humans just outright suck. Before kunark, the
only legit reason to play one was to be a monk...that isn't even the case
any more, since iksars are 10x the monks that humans are.
