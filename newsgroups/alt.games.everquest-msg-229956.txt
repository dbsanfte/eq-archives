shades and lesser shadows are very different mobs. Shadows are in twilight
sea, on an island. They have life tap and move fast, and like to resist my
lv 56 root spell. They also eat my humble druid pet very quickly. Swirling
shadow drops seem to have been majorly nerfed; perhaps they figured too many
people were using them for skillups rather than labouring through acrylia.
Acrylia plate was worth it and one stage but I'd now say it's rubbish
especially as most smiths sell it to vendors rather than try to sell in the
bazaar. Tradeskills will always be broken unless the items you craft are
better than the items that drop, and they should wear out, have level limits
and so on to make them more viable.

So long as they don't make tradeskillers log in every few days to feed and
move harvesters (GRRRRR!) That was the main reason i quit SWG, as otherwise
the crafting system was great. They just couldn't understand that on
tatooine, solar cells do not have to be tended very often because there's an
awful lotta sunlight!!!
