Nothing... so long as the item they are selling wasn't auto-generated.

To give you an example.. lets say the US government started selling
cars. But it turns out they can actually just hit a button and the car
of your dreams pops out. So they start selling those. What would then
happen to the economy as a result. The people involved in the
manufacture of a car, and who also pay taxes to the US government find
themselves out of work. But then they're out of work.. so they are no
longer paying taxes. Furthermore, because they do not have income..
the people they themselves buy product from don't generate sales.
That also means less taxes to the government. If they can't cover
their costs.. they go out of business. These are the problems you get
when you start doing such things. And personally... if SoE wants to
manufacture items in-game.. using the procedures that are available to
every player, more power to them, they just can't have a program
generate them or the economy will be devastated as a result.

They should very much be concerned about devaluing their items because
the game lives and dies based off the circultation of money and
material.
