Ah.  My mistake.  The only chracter I play much anymore is a Dark Elf
Magician.  I've been trying to find ways to get Elf Blood without totally
hosing what there is of my faction with the "good" elves, but I think the
Sisters of Errollisi are about to have a very bad time.  Next time I
attempt to get the AC ring though, I'll be auctioning that I'll buy the
blood from anyone killing the sisters.

It's too bad that all the Dark Elf NPCs appear to be bloodless.  I've wiped
out most of the first floor of Najena, and have never seen elf blood
there.  And that's annoying, because it's one of the few places where my
character can kill with impunity.  Plus, I can get charcoal there, for
making Fine Steel Plate dye.
