Odd equipment choices on the part of the devs on
some of these -

Human - all points to sta

Monk - 533ac/700hp
Pally - 557ac/796hp
SK - 625ac/924hp

Vah-shir BL some to sta, some wis
558ac/801 hp


Ok - among other things
the Pally got ac 1 (!) 
bracers compared to AC 9
for the SK.  He also got
an ac 12 shield as opposed
to the AC25/HP +40 shield
(the little rectangular one
with the dragon - can't 
remember what it's name is).
Of course the SK got a MoSS
alike - substantially better
than any weapon the BL/monk
or Pally got.

Also - casters get a bit hosed.
Shaman is completely wisdom
oriented - very low ac on everything,
definitely not Totemic analogs.

They definitely know the super
cheap items melee get a hold of
(Orc fang ear/neck, AC 10 belt,
Netherbian chitin) but they seem
clueless as to how to equip a
caster (why does a mage have an
extended affliction 1 item?)

Also, while the ear/neck/rings/
head seem the same across tanks -
the belt differs (the paladins
didn't get that ac 10 belt that's
so cheap (if people don't just
vendor it))

Warriors got a 13/27 and 12/25
weapon (Centi LS and Jagged blade
of Mourning?)

This isn't a balance issue, I just
find it interesting what they think
a level 25 should be equipped with
in a mature server economy.

Mages get a stein of Moggok and a
Hoop of Magi'Kot and elemental
binder (naturally - the 3 easiest
to get mage upgrades) but only
+2 int rings (one of which would 
never get worn, as the summoned ring
is better mana/hp and a focus effect),
and that blue robe (int 5, +25 mana
and some hp, 9ac - CCS?  I had one
at some point IIRC).

hmmmm - just odd decisions
