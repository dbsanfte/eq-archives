When I cast Lull on myself to up my skills, I normally find some out-of-the
way spot to cast it on myself repeatedly until my Alteration is maxed out
for my level.  Then I work on Divination by casting True North until I've
spun myself silly.  After that, I Strike myself a lot, and follow up with a
whole series of minor healings.  Then I'll Yaulp till the cows come home.
This 'training' will usually max out my skills for my level before too long.
The level 1 spells are especially handy for this the higher level you get.

The Lull spell won't last too long on you, which is why you can cast it on
yourself repeatedly.

I do this as soon as I level, and can find a quiet place where I'm not
disturbing anyone else, and where no monster is going to disturb me.  That
way, when I start adventuring, I'm taking care of my group, and not worrying
about my skills, and I can give my group my best efforts.

I figured this out from the days when I was still soloing my cleric, and
finding that every skill point was a matter of life-or-death for me out in
combat...especially when that much needed 'Flash of Light, step back, and
Gate' escape plan didn't work, because my Divination skill was abysmal.

By the way, the long casting time of most clerical combat spells is one of
the factors that make soloing a cleric very difficult beyond a certain
level.  Flash of Light is one of your quickest and mana-cheapest spells,
which is why I still use it, even past level 20.  It's really handy when
you're in a group and acting as the chief healer.  Mobs ag you?  Blind them,
step back, let the tanks take them, and keep healing your party members.
