This "inescapable water" problem exists in Sanctus Seru as well. When
I fell in to one of the pools there and spent an hour trying to find a
way out, I finally read a post on Allakhazam that told me how to get
out. You have to hold down move-forward (not auto-run) and look up
(this is how you NORMALLY get out of water) but then also keep
ducking/standing over and over. You will eventually get out.

When the GM I had petitioned showed, I had just gotten out of the
water. She asked how, and I told her. She was so suprised she tried it
a couple of times.

Looks like the water problem may be deliberate. If it is, then I
expect ducking to eventually stop working, but I was still able to
demonstrate it to a friend last night.
