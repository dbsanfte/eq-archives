Maybe his point becomes clear if you bother to notice that after
the obvious hyperbole of Richard's first sentence he explains why
Clerics tend to do poorly as soloers, concluding with:
"You'll get *much* better XP from a group."
Given that DT's reply follows that, it looks to my like you're
way out of line nitpicking the pointedly obvious exageration of
his first sentence.  The real question here is, what's your
point in pretending to be unable to comprehend three sentences
of quoted text?
