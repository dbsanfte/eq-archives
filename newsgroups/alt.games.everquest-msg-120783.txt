The only tradeskill I have ever made any money at was Jewelcraft with an
Enchanter but when I started it you could get 300-400p for a Silver Ruby
veil or a Silver sapphire necklace. They sold as fast as I could make them
and financed my way to Platinum jewelry. Now days its not worth the effort
to make up Velium stuff and try to sell I carry the stuff and only make
custom made jewelry now, too much stuff on the market. Tradeskills are only
used to pass the time or to make specific items for your characters. I have
a master Fletcher to make my guildies shaped compound shadewood bows I
figure I have lost 4k in plat and you can't sell one for 100p over cost.
