Why only to a point?  Before KEI they had c2 (11/tick).  Besides, on
a raid (or in a high level group) KEI makes remendous sense.  It's
that L25 out there self-PLing instead of grouping, or that group that
rejects an Enchanter because they all have KEI, that fuel the "KEI
hurts the game" argument.  Raids don't have a thing to do with it.
