If he didnt, he would have already fried his processor

Im not sure if this was mentioned before....

Are you sure the voltage settings on the CPU are correct? I havent
built a system in a few years - but the last one i did, the autodetect
on the cpu voltages was way wrong causing really bad system stability
issues. Once I set the voltages manually, all was good. I didnt get
heat issues - but I suppose one could. You might look into it
