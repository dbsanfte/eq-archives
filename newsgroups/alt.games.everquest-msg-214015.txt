True.  You did, however, enter the argument in support of the person
who claimed that Druid snares are inferior to Necro, and your:
"All I can say is fight a necro and see if you still hold that opinion."
line above was in response to the counter assertion (that Druid snares
are better).  So, nice try, but it doesn't float.

I can't imagine ever mem'ing an expensive short-duration Necro snare
in preference to a nice, cheap, fast-casting, long-lasting Druid snare.
