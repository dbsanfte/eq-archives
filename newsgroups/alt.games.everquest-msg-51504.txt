A place that is not QUITE as easy, but almost, and is considerably safer, is 
the Gypsy Camp in the middle of North Karana.  Run to the top of a tent, fall 
off, and keep going to the other side.  Turn around, repeat.

It's just BARELY enough of a fall to trigger the fall effect, but it does.  
I've raised Safe fall 10 points in 5 min there before.  And if, by some odd 
chance, you DO take damage (I have yet to EVER take damage there) the most 
I've ever seen anyone take who didn't have safe fall was a whopping 2 points.
