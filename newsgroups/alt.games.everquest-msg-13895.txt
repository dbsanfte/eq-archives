I had this bright idea of pressing a hot button I
have set up for /loc if it looked as though I was 
about to die which is a lot these days :-))

The theory was that when I reappeared at my bind 
point I could roll back the text window  and get the
loc reading to help me find my corpse.

Tried it a couple of times and no loc reading.
Should it work!
