Don't do it.  Do you really want to help MS get enough people on XP so
that they can force Subscription computing to be accepted? Do you
really want to pay MS a monthly fee? Do you want them to determine how
you upgrade your pc and how many times you can do before they decide
not to give you the turn it on key? Win XP is the antichrist of OS's.
