I use the Sound Blaster Live 5.1 MP3+, All of my other applications (games,
MP3's, etc) work perfect.  Even the "Loading song" while connecting is fine.
But when I hit my character screen, the sound goes to SH*T.  THe hole game
then sound like garbage and gets worse when I enter attack mode.  My best
description of the sound is "crackling".  Sounds like a fuzzy radio station.
Also, sometimes, when the attack mode music is playing, it seems like I am
missing a few chords.  Like a symphony playing Beethoven's 5th without a
brass section.

I have tried to reload my drivers and checked the soundblaster site for any
new drivers and made sure my PC volume was not maxed causing distortion.
Can anyone help?
