Nice dodge. Allow me to put it differently, then. You said "Europe won't 
give up socialism", then you said "socialism is horrible". It follows 
that life in Europe must, by necessity, be rendered horrible, at least 
in some aspects, by the socialism we won't allegedly give up... So what 
is it? That our cars are too small? Our funny accents? Our food?

You can't expect me to take your word for it about socialism being 
horrible (especially when I've experienced it and you haven't) without 
at least a few examples to back you up.
