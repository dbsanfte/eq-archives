My guild can take them, and will probably be looking to join the rotations.
The consequences of upsetting the rotation would be getting on the shitlist
of most of the major guilds on EMarr.  The issue is that the other guilds in

getting access to them.  We cannot bring them along when we take them by the
rules of the rotation.
