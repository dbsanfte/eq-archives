Totally useless to me, not being a Troll Innoruuk worshipping shaman.  At 
level 58, sitting in front of most any mob in PoN and letting them hit 
you is a sure way to get yourself killed, Stoicism is just not enough 
healing.  At level 60, I don't think I'd recommend it either, unless you 
have a bunch of AAs and/or really good equipment.  At level 65, with 
defensive AAs, and decent equipment, it's not an issue, I can do that in 
BoT on the giants.

Capping my dex is not a problem at all, Focus + Ferine Avatar means I am 
capped at 305 Dex.  Focus+Diaku gets me pretty close, and doesn't waste a 
spell slot on a short term buff (FA).

At level 65, I am mostly killing mobs that don't run anyway, so that part 
is just not an issue.

Really, when I want the snare is when I am root rotting, which is a lot 
rarer now than it used to be, mostly if I head to Tactics or HoH where 
the mobs mitigate enough to make it difficult to allow them to just beat 
on me.
