> Arrows will not do the kind of damage that you are after.

Well, true, but if you WANT to get your archery skill up, fear-kiting is as
good a way as any, you just need a lot of patience and a LOT of arrows.
Snare, Panic, then keep shooting. You have the advantage of when it turns
back to you you can re-panic before it gets back to melee range. A
compromise is to shoot until you get a skill-up then go in and melee it off.
