Yes, I think Kim has "heard of it," considering it was mentioned in Kim's
initial post. Maybe you read it?

Seems that she *likes* the idea of an added dimension of danger and
adventure. Odd, huh? Far different to explore, one would think. And maybe,
just maybe, more exciting to some.

Heck, it's not as if the z-axis issue is relegated to KK alone. It affects
other zones, including nearby Unrest. Verant's programmers "forgot" nothing,
the reasons for the screwy agro ignoring z-axis are well known, agree with
them or not. Those same issues rear their ugly head in a number of other
places.

Mind you, you won't find *me* going to KK; I don't relish the idea of a
corpse run down there. But I understand why somebody would want to go,
especially because the zone is so underutilized.

Sounds like a dozen other zones to me.

Or people looking for a bit of variety in their adventure?
