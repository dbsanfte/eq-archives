Believe me, it isn't - even in a twisted sort of way.  I started a new
mage on Test last night, not realising it was a patch day today.  When
I arrived in Nektulos this morning, there were about 50 newbie drow
all chasing the same stuff.  Not so bad I suppose, but there was also
a load of shouting about how long will the patch will take and how
much they miss their FBSS etc.  Multiply that by a few tens of
thousands and it would be unbearable.

No wonder the regulars on Test get so pissed off on patch days.  I
suppose I should count myself amongst them now.
