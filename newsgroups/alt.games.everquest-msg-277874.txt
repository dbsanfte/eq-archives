I'm debating whether to go to Heaven or Hell...

Is Bush going to Heaven???


Unbelievably these 'Christia-nuts' welcome the unfortunate and
preventable destruction of the environment. What's worse, they control
the politicians who are sure to vote against any solution. If we don't
have a REVOLUTION, we are doomed indeed...

"Many Christian fundamentalists feel that concern for the future of our
planet is irrelevant, because it has no future. They believe we are
living in the End Time, when the son of God will return, the righteous
will enter heaven, and sinners will be condemned to eternal hellfire.
They may also believe, along with millions of other Christian
fundamentalists, that environmental destruction is not only to be
disregarded but actually welcomed -- even hastened -- as a sign of the
coming Apocalypse."

VIVA LA REVOLUCION!!! (great!)
"The World Revolution is an idea for a new, global activist social
movement for progressive social change. It aims to resolve in a
definitive and comprehensive manner the major social problems of our
world and our era. Major issue areas of the World Revolution include:
peace, human rights, the environment, and world poverty."

"Against the assault of Laughter nothing can stand." -Mark Twain

Our own revolution too subscribes to NONVIOLENCE, and embraces the same
goals, but it's different from all others. 'BANANA REVOLUTION' I called
it, since I believe that LOVE AND LAUGHTER are the best vehicles for
change. Oh, and it's very irreverent of power...

"This is why you should not allow anyone to call you BOSS...

In the beginning of humanity, when God created the human body, the
vital organs started an argument over who should be the BOSS. The BRAIN
explained: "I should be the BOSS, since I order the function of all of
you." The EYES argued: "We should be BOSS, because we guide the whole
body." The HEART claimed: "I should be the BOSS, since I carry the
blood for all to function." "In that case," protested the STOMACH, "I
will be the BOSS, because I feed everybody." The LEGS declared to be
BOSS since they carried the whole body. And it was when the ASSHOLE
asked to be BOSS, that everybody got pissed off. It only said: "I will
be the BOSS... And if not, I declare myself on strike." Then it shut
himself up for five days... The BRAIN was feeling dizzy... The EYES got
cloudy... The HEART threatened to stop... The STOMACH was exploding...
The LEGS were shaking... Then everybody cried: "LET THE ASSHOLE BE THE
BOSS!" And since then... ANY ASSHOLE CAN BE BOSS!!!"
