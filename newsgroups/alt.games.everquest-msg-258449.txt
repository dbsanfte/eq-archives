Woo?  Maybe the chance will actually get high enough that it's worth buying.
I don't see it now... since the GoD one barely ever goes off, and costs a
*ton* of AA points to buy.

Not bad.

Sounds like a second version of Escape.   Pretty cool, assuming they're on
separate recharge timers.

Hmm... only two listed.   I'm guessing we get some of the ones listed for
other classes as well?   Or maybe the list is incomplete?

Ug, of all the things they could give us, they pick what seems to be the
most useless GoD AA, and then give us an improved version of it doing the
exact same thing!

Just 2 new things for our class only, and this is what they pick?   Give me
the SK hp drain ones instead : p

Useful for interrupting spells on non-stunnable mobs I suppose.

Still very underwhelming, to only get two new things... and only have one of
them sound even "decent"
