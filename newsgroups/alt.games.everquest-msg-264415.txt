Some tasks are like that, others are like "kill these 10 random dark
blue spawns in a big/dangerous zone", plus a bunch of running around
before and after.  My cleric got a task to kill Erollisi Bloodthorns
(I think, some kind of flower anyway), but finding them while
avoiding/fighting off aggro mobs was too tedious so I gave up after
two hours total.

Generally I think the shorter tasks may be the only ones worth doing[1],
but I have pretty much given up on the task system, but then I don't
much enjoy soloing in EQ at the best of times and as a cleric I have a
relatively easy time getting a group (though on a low population
server like Venril Sathir it can still be pretty hard).

[1] But maybe I just suck...
