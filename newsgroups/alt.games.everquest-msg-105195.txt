I ported in to get something and the skelties and diseased rats surrounded
me =).  There's two camps of diseased rats, one with a scarecrow in the
middle that will NOT target...so i can't hail it to see if he's part of a
quest or anything. There's also a new npc in the southeast corner of the
misty thicket, his home is flanked by two named wolves and his name is _____
the Inhospitable. (forgive me, i don't remember his name).  He, like the
scarecrow, cons indifferent to me and refuses to answer my hails.  Perhaps
we got some new quests brewing?
