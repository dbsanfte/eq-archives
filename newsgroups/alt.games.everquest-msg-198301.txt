My guide experience was a good one, for the most part.  I didn't last
long at it, though, because what I found was that it felt too much
like a job, which indeed it is.  However, there are GM events, which
on my guide server were a lot more common than on my play server of
The Nameless, and petition-bashing made people feel as though at least
someone was listening most of the time.

I think it's worth it if you're willing to become a servant for no
more pay than having your monthly account fee waived, which is your
reward as a guide.  Well, that and getting to see parts of the game
that a lot of people never get to see; when you're a guide, your
character is marked as non-aggro to all mobs, so if you want to walk
up and look at Trakanon, you're welcome to do so. :)

You are not, however, completely free to walk up to, say, Innoruuk, or
Kerafyrm if you're on Stromm, or Cazic-Thule.  These mobs won't aggro
on you; however, they are in what are termed CS-limited zones. 
Something a lot of people don't know is that a guide may not enter
certain zones unless it is to handle a specific petition;  Planes of
Hate, Fear, Mischief, and Growth are included, as well as VP (although
that may have changed now) and Kerafyrm's Lair, to name a few.  A
guide is never to be in these zones because they are zones of limited
access; in the case of VP, until recently, a person could not have
gated out if they got in trouble, either.  The reasoning behind this
is that the temptation of having a guide in the zone might be too much
for some people; and since guides are only human, SoE is afraid that
guides might take pity on people in a rough situation and bail them
out, which is against the vision of the game.  (I won't go into how
many times SoE has abrogated that vision themselves...)  Undoubtedly
many of the PoP flag zones are CS-limited as well; however, I stopped
being a guide right after PoP came out and never got the revised P & P
document.

Apprentice guides are even more limited; they are forbidden to enter
any dungeon.  This is for their safety more than anything else.  An
apprentice guide is given only one piece of equipment; a "gate stick".
 It's a staff that with an insta-click gate spell effect.  No mob will
attack an apprentice guide; however, if a guide falls very far, or
lands in lava, the guide dies just as any other character.  He then
has to /pr and tell all his fellow guides that he died, and they
generally make fun of him, take screenshots of his corpse, etc...:)

Overall, being a guide was fun - but don't take it on without a.)  a
feeling that serving the people who play EQ is a higher calling, b.) 
a lot of patience, c.)  a buttload of knowledge of the game, and d.) 
a sense of humor.

If you do want to become a guide, visit the EQLive site - the
information and application are there.  The application includes
questions about you, your life, your EQ habits, a test of your EQ
knowledge, and an essay - you must write a storyline for your existing
main to demonstrate your ability to immerse into the game.

Have fun!
