/sigh
I have been undone by common usage.  Consulting the "New World
Dictionary of American English", the relevant definition for
talent is "a superior, apparently natural ability in the arts
or sciences or in the learning or doing of anything".

In common usage it is not unusual to encounter the word used
as in "Zeno is an extraordinarily talented violinist" referring
to the skill of an adult who has spent many years developing that
very skill.  I assume (perhaps mistakenly I suppose) that you
are not ready to claim that the ability to make exquisite music
with tool of recent invention is somehow inborn in human beings?

Back to your attempt to place "talent" in opposition to skill,
let's go to the definition of skill, which is given as "great
ability or proficiency; expertness that comes from training,
practice, etc.", which is in perfect accord with common usage
in my experience.  Now, when you, Dave Christian, say "You can
certainly improve that ability with practice", you cannot avoid
the implication that the ability in question is, by definition,
a skill.

It is a skill.  Some people are unusually talented and thereby
get a headstart on the rest of us.  Others do not start out with
the same degree of "apparently natural ability" and yet still
achieve "great ability", often exceeding the ability of the most
"talented" because they develop practice and study skills at a
young age while the talented are getting by easy.  Actually,
this is why I get riled so easily when people start talking
about "talent" in the field of music, becaause those who do
almost always are seeking to imply that musical skill is some
sort of freebie handed out by randomly.  In fact, every skilled
musician I've ever known has worked very hard over a period of
many years to develop their skills (strumming 3 power chords on
the guitar does NOT make you a skilled musician).  The "talented"
prodigies all ended up selling insurance or whatever because
they never learned decent practice and study habits and so their
musical skills stagnated early.  Meanwhile, the ignorant pretend
that the skills of those who persevered are actually handouts,
thinking to themselves that it is somehow unfair that they who
didn't invest thousands and thousands of hours developing their
own musical skills cannot match the performance of those who did.

I do hope you've managed to catch a clue by now.  Or do you still
cling to some inarticulatable definition of skill that is unique
to your own private world?
