They've already made it so such things can't happen (well with Kael
armor anyways, don't know too much about Thurg armor since those
little shitheads want to beat on me more than give me the quest).

There's a minimum level required to get the quest for Kael armor.
Even multiquesting, can't be done without all of the characters being
at least level 50 (or maybe 51).

Quest givers will simply eat the items otherwise.

Basically, the almight "Vision" has taken into account outrageous
twinking and blocked it for the most part (ok, so full cobalt + pair
of SoDs are still possible on a level 1) with a few exceptions.
