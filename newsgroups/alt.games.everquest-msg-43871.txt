It says Im not subscribed when I sign on and if i want to subcribe now or
later, so i did. And it said "thank you for subscribing to everquest" and then
i sign on and it says im not subscribed. i tried subscribing like 5 times and
it said the same thing, so i called thier # to help and theyre only open on
weekdays so i have to call monday. so i emailed them and they didnt mail me
back yet. so my question is, is there anyway i can fix this without waiting
until monday?

thanx
