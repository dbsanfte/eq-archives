OT, you can solo there...many of the lesser mobs (Sarnak Beserkers, Thorny
Succulents, Stoneleer cockatrices) will be blue and are beatable...I used to
solo there at that level (when I had the same problem as you) with lesser AC
and weapons.
Downside, I had the outpost to run to as I am Dark Elf and you won't have
that safety.
Also, if you do decide to try this, leave the Sabretooths and Rhino's alone,
they fight till death never turning.

Expect some huge downtime as well. To tell the truth, I'd suggest trying to
get a healer partner over there (people in low 40's will still solo or
partner up in OT instead of finding a group in DL) Shaman, Druids and even
Necro's (you'd be surprised how well they can heal) make good partners.
To put it bluntly tho, you're solo'ing days are over...I can still drop
blues solo, at 51, in DL but at a rate of about 1 an hr with no healing,
that's not what I'd call effective.
