Reading this article on plat sellers 
http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,62929,00.html?tw=wn_story_page_prev2 
I stumbled across this quote:

"[SOE PR Director Chris] Kramer says Sony Online has talked with IGE about 
possibly forming a partnership in the future, but that for now, no such 
plans are in the works."

WTF???

kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 
till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, 
children, it's blood... blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may 
be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.'
