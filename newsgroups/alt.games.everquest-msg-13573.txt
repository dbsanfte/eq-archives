speaking of beggers...... i got a story to relate that happen to me.

I was sitting in cab and a 4 level warrior asked me for a weapon, when i
turned i see a warrior with tarnish shan'tok and full cab armor.

"I am sorry I am a poor warrior too."

"your WS says other wise."

"well your cab armor says otherwise."

"my friend gave this to me."

"my guild father is letting me use his WS have a nice day."
