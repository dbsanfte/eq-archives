The only way you are going to make "good" money from a tradeskill, other
than selling precombines like leather paddings or celestial essences, is if
you farm drops yourself and then turn them into items.  Often times
tradeskill drops can sell for more than the finished item itself, so in
theory you could be making just as much if not more money by simply selling
the drops.

At level 4 the type of tradeskill drops (silks, pelts, etc.) that are going
to be availableto you are much more valuable in their unprocessed state,
than whatever you would be turning them into.

The best time to make money with a GM tradeskill is after a new expansion
comes out. New recipies often well based on novelty and rarity.  In general
though, you aren't going to be making a fortune off tradeskills.  There are
many GMs of every skill out there, and competiton tends to keep the prices
down.
