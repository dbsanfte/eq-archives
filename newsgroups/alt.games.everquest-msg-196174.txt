Thats an interesting point; since a horse means giving up some HP regen, having
a HP regen item will help more than might seem the case, just as an FT item
counts for more on a bard (bottom of the barrel mana regen) than it does on
someone with Meditation 200 and KEI on (one tiny drop in a big bucket)

While I'm familiar with the concept, I'm dubious about the need for it.  The
recast time on canna seems very short, and the cast time long enough that I'd be
spending no more than 50% of my time sitting at best; why not just hack out
standing cannas till my HP and mana bars match, then sit if I really want to get
both back up to full?  Might be losing a little bit of mana, but really, how
much?

Haven't tested this, mind you, just working on the little playing around I did
while busy being a melee monster.
