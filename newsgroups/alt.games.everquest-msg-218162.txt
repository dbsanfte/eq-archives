If you are 65 with LDoN isn't the pp and occasional sellable loot from
LDoN missions gaining you fairly good plat? In a pickup group I was in
the other day, after selling gems and jewellry the master looter split
about 450 pp to each group member. Two or three missions in an evening
can add up to a nice chunk of change, though not all missions drop quite
that much.
