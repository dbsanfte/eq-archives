Assuming you aren't having trouble maxing all your skills, I'd use them to 
train a language.  Maybe Combine.  Languages are the one skill that you 
really -can't- raise without help.

Actually, for a rogue, that may also apply to your backstab skill, and 
that'd be more important, if it's lagging even a tiny bit.
