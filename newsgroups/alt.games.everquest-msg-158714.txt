What service can Warriors, Rogues, Magicians, Monks, Paladins,
ShadowKnights, Necromancers, etc sell *safely* for 100+ PP a half
hour?

Druids (and Wizards) had it good for a long time, but now the gravy
train has stopped. Welcome to the "real world" of EQ. Now go out and
group/solo for PP like everyone else. You will get no sympathy from me
(or most other players).

PS I played a Druid for 51 levels prior to retiring him. You won't see
me whining about the new port system.
