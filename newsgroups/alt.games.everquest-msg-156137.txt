Actually, bazaar pricing in general has been getting a lot more
cutthroat in the last few days, with exceptions for a few higher
end items like Fungi and Boots of Flowing Slime which seem to be
pushing upward (on my server at least).  I attribute it to the
pending release of PoP, I think there're quite a few people
trying to improve their "cash" position in anticipation of
the (presumed) opportunities that are about to present themselves.
