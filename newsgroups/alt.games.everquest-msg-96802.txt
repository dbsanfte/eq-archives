Cokelore! Grabbed from snopes:

In 1984, coke was losing ground to Pepsi.  In blind taste tests, people
preferred the taste of Pepsi.
Coke made "new coke" which was basically diet coke with real sweetener
instead of artificial.
In taste tests, people preferred the new coke to both pepsi and old coke.
Coke discontinued old coke, announced new coke, and the public went nuts,
before even trying it.
Apparently, old coke, while tasting worse, was preferrable to the American
people because they were simply used to it.  People are strange.  Thousands
of people will still swear that new coke tasted terrible.  Of course, anyone
under the age of 25 missed this whole thing.
