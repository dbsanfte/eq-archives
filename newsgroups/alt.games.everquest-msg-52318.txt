I know that, I killed the PH at the correct time 12 times and got a bag of
bones each time. Just because you kill it at the correct time does NOT mean
that a grimrot will spawn it just means that either the grimrot or the
standing putrid skeleton will spawn at the appointed time. IE 4 pm to 7 pm
to spawn daytime spawn and hopefully the live one and 4 am to 7 am to spawn
at nite and hopefully the dead version.
