of course they had witches back then, they are mentioned many times in the
Bione example that  comes to mind is the witch of endor.  ex22:18 is not the
only place that it is mentioned not to use witchcraft, deut 18:10 says not
to practice divination, socery, interpet omens, engage in witchcraft, or
cast spells, to be a medium or spiritist, or to consult the dead.  it says
all these things are detestable to the Lord.
