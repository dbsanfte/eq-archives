Not for me it isn't!  I have an Enchanter in EQ and I want to try out
the enchanters in EQ2.  I want to try both of them to see how they
differ.  It is possible that they will differ enough that I want to
continue with them both.  This would only leave me with 2 slots to try
other classes.

In the long run 4 will probably be enough but when I am trying to find
out which classes are fun 4 will not be nearly enough.
