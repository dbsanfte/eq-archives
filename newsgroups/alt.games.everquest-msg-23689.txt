Never been teleported here and never had sow, but i have invis
(enchanter lvl 4, necro lvl 18) so i basically follow the path
mentioned earlyer, but i have never gone in the water, but if
you have no invis maybe that is needed, the ew coastline is rather
high and steep at som places(i took 79 dmg when turning of the bridge
to soon)

My last trip here with my chanter i picked up the GD portal key, good
to have for the future when i can afford to pay the person porting a
good amount of pp's.

Never killed a snow bunny, since fighting will remove my invis, and my
lvl 18 necro would get no xp, and at lvl 4 the one i saw did con
black, so i didn't risk it lol.

Was thinking of getting the coldaine dagger for my chanter but at 78pp
i could not afford it at that time.

Happy travels

/Regards Berth (Thotamon lvl 18 DE necro luclin)
