I auctioned to sell a Gnoll Hide Lariat. Someone agreed to buy it for
5pp. It was in the bank, so I went and pulled it out and gave it the
buyer. Turns out I actually gave him a Crystal Fiber worth 150pp that
has exactly the same graphic. I didn't discover this until the next day
when I wanted to use the Fiber. The buyer was long gone of course.
