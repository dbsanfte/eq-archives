Will concede the point on trees cut down not growing back, except
it's not as bad as you make it.  Logging is actually the one part
of the environmental agenda I have some familiarization with (
my father and uncle  own a logging/lumber company that I worked
for during my youth/young adulthood).  Old growth forests are never
clear cut.  Never.  Most of the old trees (the healthy ones) ARE
cut, because they usually are the best bet for having a high 
percentage
of FAS lumber inside (FAS = good money lumber).  The younger trees
below a certain size (not just saplings) are left alone, and the
standard for most companies is to plant 3 trees for every one cut
down.  Clear cutting is rarer than strip mining these days.  It
destroys the future of the forest, from the small trees to the
erosion of soil not letting new trees take hold.  If you've ever
been on land decried by the wackos as "clear cut," you'd be
surprised at how full of trees the area is.  The difference
is mainly turning an "old growth" forest into simply a "growth"
forest, but if the arguement then goes to "what about the spirit
of the old trees?" (which I've actually heard during a community
meeting), then that's something that one should debate with
their psychiatrist, not a logger.

Species go extinct all the time.  If we fuck up enough stuff,
then we'll go extinct.  This would actually please some enviro-
folk (see the Voluntary Human Extinction page :-)  ).  It's one
thing to hunt down Bengal tigers and destroy a pod of Humpback
whales, but most normal folks have a hard time caring about the
loss of the three-spotted lung worm when there are jobs and
families to care for.  It may sound harsh, but that's human
nature.

Agreed...I think the main folks who should be aghast about climate
change are folks in Hawaii...when Canada is 74? year round the
vacation industry might suffer...;-)

And nobody (at least in this thread) is arguing about discrimination.
Equal protection is part of the US constitution in order to protect
the minority from the majority.  That's a good thing.  What's not
a good thing is the minority using it as a club to force an agenda
upon the majority.  If it happens enough, the majority usually shows
the backlash by enacting laws.  I don't say right or wrong, just
that this is how the country is set up.  One Supreme Court of one
state declared something in Massachusetts that many of this country
don't agree with.  A lot of many.  Whether you think it's right
or wrong, these people have their beliefs and opinions.  If enough
of 'em get together and get motivated to elect and lobby for a law
to get passed, it will.  If the law that is passed is a legally
enacted law that passes muster with the court, then it falls to
those who don't like to law to sway public opinon the other way.
Like what happened with Prohibition.  It's just the way the country
is set up, and I don't think there is a way that is more fair to
more people than any other way.
