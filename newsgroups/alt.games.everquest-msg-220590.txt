I've observed this working several times in the last week.

That is:

-I've assisted a mezzed mob, seen it targetting the chanter.
-The warrior has taunted.
-I've assisted the mob again, and seen it targetting the warrior while 
still mezzed.

Because of this I find it more likely that it is a case of 
proximity/sit aggro not being applied until a mezzed mob is awoken,  

That could explain why sometimes the chanter gets wailed on, even when 
the mob is targetting the tank, and also why sometimes the mob is 
targetting the chanter but goes for the tank when awoken.
