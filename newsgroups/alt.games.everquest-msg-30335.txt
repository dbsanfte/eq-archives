In EQ everyone is obsessed with their experience too, but in EQ that
means grouping, more often than not.  In AC, soloing is easy; not so
in EQ -- past a certain point, while you *can* still solo, you will
probably find it easier to get experience in a group.  And everyone
realizes this, so grouping is more or less the norm.  The EQ UI is
much better suited to grouping than the AC one too, and I find the
various modes of talking to people much easier to use as well.
