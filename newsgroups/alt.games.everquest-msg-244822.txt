Give or take a couple hours being the important part of that sentence.

Give or take several more hours.  And diverging more on each respawn,
depending on  how the timer comes up that time.

And still won't know within a range of several hours when it will spawn, due
to the random element.

When I was raiding, it was pretty much a given that we were going to raid
every day.   It was however a big question of when.  Raids could start
anywhere from 5 pm to 9 pm, depending on what was up and who was on.

Agreed.   Which is why you really have to reach to get "5 -10 minutes" from
what I said.

Lifespan measured in minutes means that it lasts short enough that it is
more convenient to measure it in mintues than it is in hours.   As such,
anything under two hours would qualify.  You wouldn't say "It was only up
for 3/4 of an hour."   If it was said in converstation it would be said as
45 minutes.

Heh.    On your server perhaps.   We always had at least two wannabe uber
guilds that would race anything not already dead, reguardless of who was
gathering. (One that was bigger and well equipped enough to kill things, but
heavily populated by assholes.   The other was always the same group of
idiots, but they were generally wearing a new guild tag each week.)
