I've used Rivervale. by the Oven.

The hut out in misty off the path is nice too.

Inns in town are risky as the NPCs like to snatch your gear.

Apparently there is a spot in EC that people think is good to use.  lose
stuff all the time.  

I'm tempted to spend a couple days with a naked invis mule by the EC
abandoned inn.

The abandoned inn in Commons just outside of Freeport has a stone hut
thats quite popular.  I went there to pass some stuff over to my DE
enchanter and there were two people there doing the same thing.  we Used
each other instead.
