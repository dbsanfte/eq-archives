 Yeah, as I monk I know about First Aid and Critical Mend. I wasn't
exactly sure what Banadage Wound alt-skill for Warriors did, though.

 I haven't put any in First Aid myself since I never carry bandages.

spend points on instead of that at the moment. Once I start running out
of things to train I'll probably go for FA and CM.
