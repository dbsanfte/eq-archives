I played a bard to 44, and though I did very much enjoy making a lot 
happen all the time, it did get to be a chore. You always feel like you 
should be twisting all the time. Between big pulls while everyone else is 
parked medding and chatting, I felt like I had to keep HP and mana regen 
songs going constantly, therefore I wasn't a very chatty sort.

It just got to be too much like work for me. I'm currently debating a 
necro or mage alt. I have the mage rolled, but just at level 4 and 
haven't definitely made up my mind yet.
