I think not all people get in the poles and walls on purpose.  Maybe some,
but not all.  Reason I think this is because, I was on my trader and the
next day I noticed I didn't sell one thing.  So I logged off to play my
main.  I was telling my friend how I was so mad that I didn't sell anything,
and he was like well yea, I went by to see how she was doing on sales and
she was stuck in the wall where he couldn't target her.  I didn't do it on
purpose or anything.. I think just sometimes it just happens...
