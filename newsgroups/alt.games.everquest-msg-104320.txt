I haven't noticed vendors hitting for more than one would
expect for their level (compared to non-vendor NPCs).

I've sometimes fought vendors (without killing them) in order
to try to put them back in place when they were "lost", or
to try for a few weapon skill-ups before zoning out.

One thing that has always amused me is that Krystin Charcoal,
the brewing supplies vendor in W.FP, is bare-handed and
wears a dress and an apron, but hits much harder than the
nearby Freeport Militia guard (Effel?) who dual-wields
two swords and wears plate armor...  But it's because she's
higher level, not because vendors are innately harder hitters.
