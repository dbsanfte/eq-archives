Me neither... and I've been using nvidia straight through, from tnt2 
ultra, geforec2 Ultra, geforce4ti4600, geforce fx5200, finally to 
geforce 6600gt.  The only problems I ever had was was with lighting in 
the TNT2... vertex lighting in EQ used to suck, and the gamma on nvidia 
cards was both too low, and unmodifiable in EQ at the time. Since then 
its been fine. (The fx5200 was clunky and slow though for a directx9 gfx 
card... but i knew that it would be when i bought it for my 2nd box... 
the 6600gt otoh has been a treat).

Level of logged in characters is frequently wrong; it seems to often 
retain the level of the last alt rhey logged in or something.

I don't have that issue... i occasionaly get "Reset Device Failed" and 
crash when alt-tabbing in and out of full screen, but that's it.
