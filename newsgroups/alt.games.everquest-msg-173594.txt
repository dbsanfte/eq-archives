EQ Diva does indeed break down songs by instrument and modifier with /
without.
ie:
Selos
Song Effects:
At level 58 (for Group)

Speed % Increase
+73% faster sung
+103% faster w/instrument
+118% faster w/magical instrument

As you mentioned there are songs that *require* an instrument for it to
work (invis/see invis) where as Selos you get a big boost, same with
your healing songs, you can sing it but you will heal much more with a
lute.

Then of course you get into instrument modifiers as well, different ones
have different modifiers such as lute, combine lute, gypsy orc lute (or
something).  Again, EQDiva has this under the download section in an
excel spreadsheet.

Spend a little more time there and most of your questions will be
answered.  Any that aren't head over to the bard forums (there is a link
to it on EqDiva :) )
