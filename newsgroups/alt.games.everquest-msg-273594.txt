They don't suck at all. As a level 22 Provisioner the goods might cost 
20 or 30s at the most, usually a lot less, and you get 1g 8s as the 
reward for completing the quest. I made about 5g in as many hours last 
weekend. Plus it's a lot quicker than going out into Stormhold or TS and 
killing a bunch of group-only mobs (unless you have a group at your beck 
and call).
