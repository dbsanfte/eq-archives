why are you root dotting . summon and buff pet. regen self and pull giant
with togors . add a dot or 3 if you dont want to wait the 3 minutes for your

Tradeskills always take significantly more money to raise then they are ever
worth.

seafury cyclopses are fun. With sow on you and your pet you can easily lead
one on a merry chase and never even get hit .  Every once in awhile throw a
high taunt spell on it so it dosent whack your pet . I soloed my first
seafury at 34 with my chanter this way . (incidently you need sow , jboots
not fast enough since seafuries are fast ) They drop gems worth 50-100pp
every 3rd or so time .

If you have some good bags consider hunting goblins deep in sol A or
permafrost for fs weapons (I kinda like dalnir , nurga and droga too but
there you need good resistance gear ) Fs weapons sell for 5pp each and the
mobs frequently drop the odd plat or 2 . This is by no means fast but should
net you 100 plat per hour at least . It also offers the oppurtunity to clear
to areas that occasionally drop interesting objects .

For the best results though, try and get a group on the ridge in dls or even
in city of mist . Make money and exps at the same time . This should work
best with 2 monk partners . No clerics to steal the lionshare of the wealth
. Monks cant hold much loot, and your kill rate will suprise you even if
they are untwinked and using fists.
