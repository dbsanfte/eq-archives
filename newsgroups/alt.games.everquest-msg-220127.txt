"When I Was A Boy" by Frank Hayes:

    When I was a boy our Nintendo
    Was carved from an old Apple tree
    And we used garden hose to connect it
    To our steam-powered color tv.

    But it still beat that ancient Atari
    'Cuz I almost went blind, don'tcha know,
    Playing Breakout and Pong on a video game
    Hooked up to the radio.

    And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
    Barefoot, uphill both ways,
    Through blizzards in summer and winter
    Back in the good old days.
    Back when Fortran was not even Three-tran
    And the PC was only a toy
    And we did our computing by gaslight
    When I was a boy.

    When I was a boy all our networks
    Were for hauling in fish from the sea--
    Our bawd rate was eight bits an hour (and she was worth it!),
    And our IP address was just 3.

    And you kids who complain that the World Wide Web
    Is too slow oughtta cut out your bitchin',
    'Cuz when I was a boy every packet
    Was delivered by carrier pigeon

    And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
    Barefoot, uphill both ways,
    Through blizzards in summer and winter
    Back in the good old days.
    Back when Fortran was not even Two-tran
    And the mainframe was only a toy
    And we did our computing by torchlight
    When I was a boy.

    When I was a boy our IS shop
    Built relational tables from wood,
    And we wrappered our data in oilcloth
    To preserve it the best that we could.

    And we carried our bits in a bucket,
    And our mainframe weighed 900 tons,
    And we programmed in ones and in zeros
    And sometimes we ran out of ones.

    And we walked twenty miles to the schoolhouse
    Barefoot, uphill both ways,
    Through blizzards in summer and winter
    Back in the good old days.
    Back when Fortran was not even One-tran
    And the abacus? Only a toy!
    And we did our computing in primordial darkness
    When I was a boy.
