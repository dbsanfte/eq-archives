From the shadows, the mysterious bizbee <tuberoo@earthlink.net> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Btw this post inspired me to revisit the early days of the newsgroup.
Did you know you were mentioned before you ever arrived here? Almost
prophetic-like... or would that be Messiah-like?

And now you know the REST of the story....


"Oreh Ta Egral" was talking to Alex Mars at the time; he (Alex) is
still a very familiar name to those of us who haunt csipg.* (the
sissypigs, /poke Knight37). Not a friendly critic of EQ anymore, IIRC.
Usenet is like one big family!

I never liked Taras Bulba; we did not get along at all. He was better
than Freek, though (at least Taras never stalked me into other
newsgroups!), and both Freek and Taras were much better (and smarter)
than Andrew.

My first post in the group - late January, 1999, late in EQ beta. I
was telling testers to find exploits and hacks....

Ironically, almost everyone in the thread topposted.
