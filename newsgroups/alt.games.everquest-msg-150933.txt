No custom UI here, but I am definitely having the problem. Logged in
twice with a character in the Bazaar. Both times as soon as the
character popped up, I began moving the UI windows around (first time
on this char since recent hard drive crash) getting them set the way I
want them, the game locked up. It happened at the exact same point
each time - after moving the target window and releasing it.

Guess I'll just have to try a character that is not in the Bazaar.
