I agree with you. There was a sad time in EQ when I came to the
conclusion I'd never get good items because I am at best a casual
player. Uber guilds were either too anal or just stuck up for my
taste. At best I had kael pants and seems I will never get my epic. As
for even sky shrine armor; I sat through three HoT raids 18 hours
worth and had nothing to show for it when over and those were tough
raids to get into.

Thank you Sony for remembering the little people who think its more
enjoyable play for PhAt L3WtZ with 5 close online friends than 20
players all rolling for a single item off an uber mob.

As for the uber guilds, I'm sure there are " whores with hearts of
gold' out there; pity is I have never met an uber guild I liked. Most
have crossed my path in a bad manner. I'm sure they'll still have
their place, for those players who prefer the herd method of role
playing and aren't happy without  40 other players in the same zone
I'm sure Sony will have content for you, it's just I could give to
rats asses about it anymore. Just not my cup of tea and not the sort
of people I prefer around. LDoN made them peripheral to non existent
for me.

It's great not to have to stoop to their level to get access to nice
items anymore.....

I'll not miss the herd mentality of ubers or their bullying ways.
Finally I have success for being a good player and I don't have to
kiss an ass or jump through uber hoops, or abandon my firends in my
old guild becuase they can't rally a hoard of players together to pull
down some uber MoB...

Just my 2 cp worth on this topic
