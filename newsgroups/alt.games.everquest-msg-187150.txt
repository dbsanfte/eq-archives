Hmmm...Well besides the stupid terrorist connection. You do know about
Kahir al-din Mohamed (not the same persian Kahir) who was known as the
"Baber or Babur" which in arabic means Tiger.
He was a descendant of Genghis Khan and founded the Mongol empire in
India, by killing thousands of native indians and overthrowing the
Sultan of New Delhi making himself the emperor of North India.
But I guess that would only offend someone from India.
Or how about Hamza al Kahir, who was a leader of the Islamic army that
would fight Jihads and kill Jews.
But I guess that would only offend Jews.
And these are not stretches, these are historical figures.
