Bound in Halas, died in Iceclad.  I made the CR.  I can't say that I enjoyed
the run particularly, I had already explored the zones on the way quite a
bit, I think that is the worst one I have had to deal with so far.  Most of
the time I can get help from guildies or other friends, but sometimes I just
have to deal with it.
