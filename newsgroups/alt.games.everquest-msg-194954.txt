Do you really think DirecTV is going to give up the $10/month so I can have
an Ultimate TV account.  I suppose MS gets a chunk of that, but there's
still money in their pocket.  They WANT me to have that recorder.  It's not
the providers that are militant.  It's the creators, who want to protect
their copyright.  Still, I can assure you, there won't be anyone knocking on
your door to arrest you for having a VCR.  Now, burn 10,000 copies and start
selling them, and you will attract cops like flies, and rightly so.

Cheers,
Eric
