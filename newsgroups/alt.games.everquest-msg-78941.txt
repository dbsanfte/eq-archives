  An item being NO DROP doesn't make it impossible to possess.
There's no restriction on looting NO DROP items you can't use.

  I guess this is a lose for the farmers (if indeed anyone bothers to
farm the thing anymore).  Doubt it will affect me much though, since I
play on FV where very few items (except newbie notes and the epic
weapons themselves) are NO DROP.  If they make this thing NO DROP on
FV I'm going to be royally pissed, since it will shoot to hell my
chances of ever doing the epic.
