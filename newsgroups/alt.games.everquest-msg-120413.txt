When I had been Ally to the Coldain for quite some time I had a friend
port me to CS and target one of the named drakes and conned it through
him.  I was Apprehensive.  Keep in mind that at this time my faction
with the Kromdif could get no worse as well.  

I spent one day in Kael in the arena and checked when I came out my
Kromzek (storm giants) also couldnt get any worse.  Had my friend take
me to CS again.  Now I am Amiable to CoV.

This was when I was level 40 and I was going to KD with my  guild's
Alliance.  Seek out a guild that goes there often for the drops and
ask if you can tag along for faction.  Explain to them that you expect
no loot, but just want to work on your Dragon Faction.
