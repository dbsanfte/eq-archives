There is an attack when attacked option?  I remember attacking when you
used /assist but didn't know you would fight back if attacked.  If so,
no one should have that option on.  That is just stupid.  All it would
do is cause problems.

Kiting will come in handy later on.

I haven't used my monk since they added audio triggers but on my other
toons I use them for when any spell wears off, when my spell is
interrupted, when my spell is resisted, when any snare lands (had to
create several triggers for that), when a mob begins to cast gate (you
get a special message for that) and on my necro, when gift of mana
fires.

I can count the times I have used necro DA on one hand.

No, and you will probably have agro.

Hmmm, well you can make a trigger for "begins to cast a spell" but that
would be pretty much worthless.  I can't think of a way to do this that
would be useful.

Yes but this will only be when the spell lands or is resisted.

Monk FD probably fails more than half the time when you first get it
but they do have the advantage of being able to hit feign while
running.  Both will get much better.  Plus with Luclin (I think it was
anyway) you are going to get a new feign with a shorter reuse, shorter
cast time, fewer fails (I think) and which does not share a timer with
your other spell (so you can use one after the other if necessary).

The necro pet will handle a few rounds depending on what you fight, but
the SK pet will be a cloud of dust.  Trash in non-raiding zones hit for
over 2k these days.  That SK pet might have 4k HP with conviction and
gear.
