They really are not so bad.  Last one I was in everyone was saying they
couldnt believe how easy it was.  You do need someone with tracking and you
should get the maps from http://www.mapfiend.net/ .  The rescue npc spawns
immediately so you can track him right away if your tracking is good.  The
boss mob doesnt spawn till you kill enough mobs, but when he does then the
dungeon will start giving you messages telling you what direction he is.
Till then just look at the map and start working your way to the area you
think he will be in.
