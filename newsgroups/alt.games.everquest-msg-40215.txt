There's mistake number one. Any merchant will charge you, oh, about a
bazillion times what armor or weapons are worth. Should advertise in
/auction that you're looking for a tailor to whip you up some tattered
leather and you're willing to pay a couple plat for a set. They'd kiss
you.

Even though dwarven warriors can certainly wear leather (patchwork)
armor, you will have to make sure it's *small* leather armor. If it's
medium or large, I don't believe you can wear it. Tailors make it out of
patterens and ruined pelts. Bear makes size large (barb, ogre, troll)
cat makes medium, and wolf makes the size small you need.
  At least I *think* that's the skin order. I haven't done any beginner
tailoring in a while.
