>   Los Angeles, Alta California - October 9, 2001 (ACN) - On
>   Monday July 9, 2001, we received a handwritten letter in our
>   mail box addressed to the publisher of La Voz de Aztlan. The
>   letter had no return address but had a July 5, 2001 U.S.
>   postal mark from Santa Clarita, California. July 5, 2001 was
>   on the week that the second largest Jewish publication in
>   the United States, the Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles
>   published a very negative article about our publication
>   because we had written a series of pro-Palestinian and
>   anti-Zionist editorials. The one page letter contained a
>   small amount of a yellowish white substance and the text of
>   the letter alluded to the fact that Jews had an illustrious
>   history in biological research that included the development
>   of the Salk vaccine. The letter ended with "Unfortunately,
>   if Hitler was alive today he would pin a medal on you.
>   Unfortunately during World War II the Arabs also supported
>   Hitler. Racism and hatred destroy!"
>
>   A few minutes after opening and reading the letter, I
>   started sneezing and coughing and became ill with flu like
>   symptoms. I connected the commencement of the symptoms with
>   the suspicious white substance in the envelope and proceeded
>   to place the letter and envelope in a plastic zip lock bag.
>   Within hours I was able to see my doctor and he put me on 30
>   days of antibiotics. I have had recurring flu like symptoms
>   ever since.

>   A few days ago a similar situation occurred in Boca Raton,
>   Florida where, according to news reports, a letter was sent
>   to the offices of a news service with a white soapy
>   substance that killed at least one person. Another person in
>   the office tested positive for Anthrax spores in his
>   nostrils. The laboratory engineered Anthrax spores came in
>   the mail in an envelope that included a "Star of David"
>   charm according to an Associated Press news article released
>   today. The FBI is presently conducting an investigation and
>   very little information has been released concerning this
>   case.

>   Everyone is assuming that Islamic terrorists are to blame
>   for the Boca Raton Anthrax incident. We believe that the
>   terrorists are actually Zionists. The reason is that we have
>   just experienced a second act of terrorism that has
>   compelled us to open an investigation with our local police
>   department. On September 27, 2001 we received an e-mail with
>   a message to shut down our website within 48 hours because
>   of our anti-Zionist content or face the consequences. At
>   first we dismissed the threat as another crackpot because we
>   receive many run of the mill threats weekly. The next day,
>   however, I personally received a second threat and this time
>   the person gave my correct home address and said that he
>   will be making a visit soon if we did not shut down our
>   website. On September 29 the person with a yahoo.com e-mail
>   address sent another e-mail saying that he knew every step I
>   made and that he has been close to me already without me
>   even knowing. A few days ago this same person sent a recent
>   photograph of myself as an e-mail attachment in "gif" format
>   taken with a telephoto lens. This last act led us to take
>   this threat seriously and we have now met with the Whittier
>   Police Department. A case file has been opened and Detective
>   Rivera has been assigned to the investigation. Tomorrow,
>   October 10, 2001 we will turn over the sealed "letter and
>   envelope" we received on July 9, 2001 for a viral/bacterial
>   analysis.

>   Both incidents of terrorism against La Voz de Aztlan have
>   been from Zionists. The envelope sent to the Boca Raton news
>   service with the "Star of David" charm appears to also come
>   from Zionists. They, the Zionists, want to silence us
>   because they do not like what we write. Everyone is assuming
>   that the dangers we face is from Islamic terrorists, but our
>   experience has been different. We fear Zionist terrorists
>   more. They have been trying to take away our constitutional
>   right of freedom of political expression through acts of
>   terrorism. They are utilizing acts of intimidation to try to
>   silence and shut down La Voz de Aztlan.
