Really...you just pop in the CD, start the setup application and walk away?
I seem to recall something about picking what type of workstation/server I
was installing, picking applications, answering hardware questions...stuff
*I* would know the answer to (or could make an educated guess, because I'm a
computer geek), but Joe Enduser wouldn't have a clue about.   Windows asks
some questions, but they're all easy.  Remember, I'm talking about (quoted
above) the masses.  It matters not one iota that Linux is a better written,
faster (yet to be proven to me though), tighter OS if it requires constant
geek help.

Different looking doesn't bother me.  Oh, it's certainly UGLIER than
Windows, but I'm used to ugly...I own a mirror. :)

(asterisks added by me)  "Just about" doesn't cut it, and it's not exactly
true, either.  If you use Linux regularly, I challenge you not to open a
terminal window for a week, then get back to me. :)

Not true...Linux crashed on me as often as Windows did.  Oh, if I were a
Linux geek I'm sure I could have solved the underlying problem, but....

I'm not saying Windows is better than Linux.  God knows I want to get away
from Microsoft, but until Linux is made a hell of a lot friendlier to end
users there's no way I'll be able to talk my boss into doing much with it at
all.
