This discussion really makes clear the difference between guilds.  If
someone in our guild posted a "xxxx has spawned, get here now message"
I would let the guy know what I thought of him (in tell, not guild
talk).  I play EQ for relaxation, not as my life, and I don't need
someone ordering me around when I'm relaxing.

Fortunately, our guild doesn't pull that kind of crap.  We try to
schedule "events" (not just "raids" but exploration trips, hide and
seek, etc) at least a week in advance, to make sure that people know
what's going on, people can plan to have the right chars on, porters
have a chance to be on a little early to get people in place, etc.

If a lot of guild chat is going by and I'm grouped and in a situation
where missing a message from my group may mean someone dying, I tell
my guild I'm going offline and switch off guildtalk.  I don't do it
very often, and it's no big deal to anyone in the guild.

As someone else said, the key is finding the guild that fits your
style, and for the guild to only accept those folks who do fit.  If
you want to be uber, head over to another guild.
