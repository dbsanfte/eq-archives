First off, no i do not work for edimensional.  I'm sorry for trying to
start a discussion about a product I found extremely exciting and
useful for EQ that is unknown in the eq community.  So shoot me.

For you others, why not read the reviews on all the EQ sites and see
for yourself?  Why would they say it works and recommend it if it
doesn't?  I don't think casters realm is part of a big marketing
conspiracy to promote junk to it's users.  That's how websites lose
their integrity, thus lose their traffic, this lose their advertisers.
 And you're right, a year ago they didn't work for EQ and a lot of
games.  A year ago there weren't nVidia native drivers for them, they
must have only been using the generic ones on the other CD that came
in the box.  I know this because they told me the newest drivers are
the ones that work with EQ, that just came out recently which is why
it is really taking off with EQ users.  Give them a try if you
want...IMO it's a must have and you won't be disappointed.
