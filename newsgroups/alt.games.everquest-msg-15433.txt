I was wondering if anyone else has had these problems and if they know of a
way to fix them.
My friend has a Compaq computer running Windows ME and is using a cable
modem.  He is able to get past the server screen in EQ.  Before EQ can
display the screen where you select your character it gives him a blue
screen.  This happens every once in a while.  On the other occations he will
be able to select his character only to get a blue screen and go link dead
midway through playing.  On both occations he needs to perform mulitple
boots before he can even get into safe mode and then shutdown and restart
his computer in the normal windows enviorment.

Any ideas on how to fix this problem would be of great help.
