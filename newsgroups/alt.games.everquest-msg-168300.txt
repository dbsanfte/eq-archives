Makes me wonder what idot came up with the controls for eq. How many 
words has the letter "a" in it and also how many of those is in the [ ] 
for quests? I'm willing to bet there is quite a bit. For my auto attack 
i have alt, ctrl shift a just to be sure i won't hit it but i know where 
it is if need be.
