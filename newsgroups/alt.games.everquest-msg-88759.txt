Well, I had my first quad-kiting experience today. I was hunting in 
Stonebrunt, trying to drag my behind out of the festering pit known as 
lvl 40, when I found myself in the place I've come to call The Valley of 
the Monkeys, behind the Kejekan village. I was bored, despondent and 
surrounded by apes, so I thought I would give something new a try; I 
loaded my area nuke and started Ensnaring away.

Well, I found quad-kiting to be a lot of fun, since it involves a lot of 
player skill, in addition to character skill, and called up all my 
Quake-honed circle-strafing abilities, but... Well, quadding in 
Stonebrunt seemed to me to be an exercise in living on the edge. The 
pathing is so atrociously bad that mobs were getting lost left, right and 
center, turning efficient quad-kiting into inefficient tri-kiting. Also, 
aggro is completely nutzoid in that zone, so I had to waste precious mana 
fearing away adds, and that also mean finishing a quartet of gorillas or 
cats with basically zero mana in the middle of a hostile area. Also, if 
the cluster got too close, getting doubled for 70-odd points of damage, 
times four, is a seriously sobering experience.

So, now that I'm hooked, what other places may be suitable for this 
activity? (and no, quad-kiting Dwarves is not an option. =P)
