Seems to be true.

Seems to be true IF and only IF it will rip the exp from your group members,
since you suddenly fight harder than you are capable of... (happened to me
once... aparently I was casting spells [that I didn't have memmed] while
link dead and poofed the mob on my druid pet).

However, last night... I was SOWed, the giant was snared, and I had 100 yard
head start and over 600 points laid into him already (and went LD while
casting another 600 into him)... aparently the server decided that my most
appropriate course of action was to stand still, and pray the giant didn't
see me.  When I logged back in, it had bashed half of my hit points from
me... which I assure you would NEVER have happened had I been at the
controls, since the giant would never have gotten close enough to spit at
me, never mind actually touch me.

    I have never died while LD (I have died while heavily lagged, and went
LD when zoning out due to death, though)... and only taken damage a very few
times while LD... all cases where I was already on a hate list when I went
LD.

    I have seen warriors (well, meleers in general) continue to attack while
LD... people report me casting while LD... but, like I said, last night, the
computer stopped me, and had me stand there, when just about ANY OTHER
course of action would have been better.
