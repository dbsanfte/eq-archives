I think Allakhazam's aren't bad, but there are often too few price points there too.
The problem is that they require manual input from people buying and selling.  I'll bet
most people don't bother to add prices; they just use the ones that are there already.

I wish the log file would record all transactions so that a parser could put together
the kind of information that would make it easy to build a database.
Something like:
"You traded 2 high quality bear pelts, 1 centi long sword for a lumberjack's cap,  and
800 platinum."

It would also help in disputing trade errors or scams..
