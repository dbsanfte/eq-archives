-- Thanks for all the responses.  I do have Wisdom enhancing gear and
always on the lookout for more and better, but also HP and Stamina
gear also. When I first created my character I put more pts into
Stamina than Wisdom on the advice of a friend since I would be soloing
a lot (and still am) and therefore would be in better shape when it
came to Meleeing.  After reading your post, I am beginning to realize
this may not have been a mistake but actually a good thing to do. Now
with Canibalize (sp?) and Regen I have enough HP to get my Mana back
in a decent amount of time and by the time the MOB is actualy hitting
on me, I am in quite decent shape to take it before dealing my killing
blow.

Thanks again for all the responses. With EQ Evolution recently
purchased I am having fun discovering the Bazaar and the convenience
it provides in getting very useful gear. I will definitely look into
Focus items as well.

- Robert.
