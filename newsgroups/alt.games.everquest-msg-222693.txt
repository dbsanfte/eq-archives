I always get a kick out of some caster spending 15 minutes finding KEI
then dying 10 minutes into an adventure. <g> 

I think for most casters, I would try to get KEI before doing a pickup
group though. You tend to have a pretty small margin for error when
doing LDoN with people you don't know and I like very little edge I
can get. Plus the loot in LDoN is good enough where spending a bit of
plat isn't really an issue in my opinion.
