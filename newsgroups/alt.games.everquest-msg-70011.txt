I feel that your discouragement for playing the Wizard is totally unfounded,
I'm just about to ding level 50, and on many, many occasions I have actually
been asked to join groups, even at lower levels. It's my personal preference
to solo, and have done so throughout my Wizard career.

All classes have their good points and their bad points, but really, it's up
to the player behind the character to make the best from what tools are
available to him/her. I have found that with a good root and nuke technique,
which can be developed from as early as level four, Wizards can level just
as fast, if not faster than other classes.

There is absolutely no reason to assume that Wizards continually die. I'm
being totally truthful in telling you that on the road to level 50 I have
died probably no more than about 15 times, less perhaps, and if I reflect
back, some off those deaths were due to other people training mobs to me,
still, that happens to all classes.

Wizards are often accused of kill-stealing, and again I can't seem to
understand why, there are plenty of hunting grounds with plenty of Mobs, so
I've not had this problem.

I will admit that playing a Wizard after a Warrior will take some getting
used to, but enjoy it, play the game, learn your strong points and
capitalise on them, learn your weaknesses and try as hard as you can to
compensate for them.

I'm not sure if I'm miss-reading the post that says Wizards can Quad Kite
from the mid-twenties or not - It is my experience that Quad Kiting is not
something a Wizard can do effectively until level 51, yes a Wizard will have
snare type spells earlier than level 51, but the casting time of AoE spells
are fairly high, so really, unless you're particularly adventurous and want
to raise your risk of dying, wait until level 51, as at this level a Wizard
can chain-cast big damage nuke spells really quickly. Root and nuke is the
key to success, so do this and rake in the experience, you'll level really
quickly, particularly if you solo.

It's often said that Wizards don't really have great buffs, but I've found
my spell buffs to be totally adequate for my needs, yes it's great to have
Shaman or other class buffs cast on you, and when you're fortunate enough to
receive these make good use of them whilst they last. If your personal buffs
are not up before a fight, cast them straightaway.

As mentioned, J Boots will help a Wizard, but then they help all classes
that can't cast SoW. I don't have J Boots, I have T Boots and I didn't buy
mine until I was level 40, I didn't need them, I simply bought SoW potions,
which sell for around an average of 100pp per ten dose pot.

In summing up, start your Wizard, get a good technique and stick with it, as
for class, well, that's up to the individual behind the Wizard. Erudite has
the most Intelligence, so this might be a good choice for you. Gnomes are
good too, they Tinker and so on. Remember that all statistics can be
adjusted by items found in the game anyway, so basically, pick a race you
like, and assuming that race can actually be a Wizard off you go.

Remember, have fun and learn as you go, patience within EQ will bring you
huge rewards.

Kind regards,

Stevie.
