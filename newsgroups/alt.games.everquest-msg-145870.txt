Easy.  The return on investment isn't worth it for everyday use,
so even though I make poisons routinely for raids, the only TRUE
use for poison use more than that is to make soloing easier.

Who can afford that, unless you're already just a twink?

Seriously...against a 8000 hp mob, I can pop off a serious poison
that can take 1/4 - 1/2 of his life away right off the bat.  Good exp,
almost no risk...why not do it a lot?

Because poison components are either (a) farmed, which is
mind-numbingly boring, or (b) vendor-bought and expensive
as hell.

(a) My 60 rogue can completely clear Droga/Nurga with no risk.
The components drop so rarely that it can literally take 16+ hours
to farm enough components for ONE stack of ingredients.  Not only
that, but the truely useful poisons are NOT trivial at 250 skill AND
the damn poison isn't stackable once made, so you end up either
carrying 6 backpacks full of poisons for one use, or sitting in a dungeon
counting on the poison to help you exp some when you hit a bad run
and fail on 17 of 20 combines.  16 hours no exp/loot wasted, and now
you can't even solo like you'd planned.  The trivials for high-end poisons
I can live with...the bags of useless poisons and time spent wasted in
greenland I can't.  And this is from somebody that LOVES poison.

(b) Sebilis mobs drop decent plat, exspecially when you collect it all
solo.  Same with Howling Stones and Chardok and Velks (gems, at
least).  The only thing about the vendor bought poisons is ending up
spending 8 plat and 2 minutes per flask of Iron Dimethy to kill a mob
only to collect 10 gold off of one and 6 pp off the next.  It's not even
worth
it to make the cheaper ones, because the effect of the poison will have
no worthwhile effect on the mob you're fighting for exp anyways (yay! Asp
poison hit for 365 when that skeleton SK with Harm Touch has 6k hps!!!).
And the mob will not even drop loot worthwhile for covering the costs of
making the freaking Sealed Vials in the first place.  Not only that, but
farming 8 billion zombies and bears for skins to make my own vials
and save a few plat is a waste of time, too.

Poison is still in need of a touchup.  It's fine for its niches.
Susceptible
Essence on Statue to insta-tash (followed by death ;-)  ).  Mage's Bane
or Twisting Disorientation on your buddy in the montly Arena Bash.  But
for everyday exp'ing? I'll just bring a druid, thanks!
