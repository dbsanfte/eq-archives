Really?  Thats odd, as a cleric I could pretty much count on denying spell
casting capability any time I really needed to; the down side being that I
wasn't nearly as good a healer when doing so.  Still, a successful stun always
interrupted a spell if it landed in time, and most mob cast spells take long
enough that either of the first two stuns was almost always faster, the third
and fourth more problematic, but with a little care you really don't ever have
to cast them for interrupts.

Once POP was released this became more difficult, as many mobs automatically
resisted the lower level stuns, leaving only the big boy to do the job, some
resisted even that.  But a few days hard work training up the new (to clerics)
Bash skill took care of that, Bash plus "big boy" still let me play interrupter
pretty much at will.

Of course the main spell worth interrupting is CHeal; CHealing mobs that manage
to get the spell off mean that all your efforts are wasted, you have to start
over at FHP or close to it, and know that if they get low they are just going to
CHeal again; its a taste of what the poor mobs must feel facing a group with a
cleric in it.  At any rate, those are the principle mobs where I'd say "I'm on
stun duty, druid is Main Healer for now"; it wasn't for aggro, though, it was
for the interrupts.
