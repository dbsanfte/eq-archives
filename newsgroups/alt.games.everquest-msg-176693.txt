Well... to be honest, I've only started liking Macs after the release of 
OSX. I've had to work with OS9 and I hold it in almost as much contempt 
as I do Windows. On the other hand, OSX is simply wonderful... UNIX at 
heart, but with the most advanced graphical interface ever.

The problem is, that interface is a bit of a resource hog, almost on a 
par with Windows XP. Enthusiasts have been installing it on woefully 
under-specced machines and then complaining that it's slow. Whatever you 
buy, make sure first that it will run OSX (make sure you go for the 
latest version, 10.2.2, a.k.a Jaguar), and then load it with as much 
memory as you can afford.

Also, it may be a good idea to lurk in comp.sys.mac.system for a few 
days or so, just to get a taste for the kind of problems people face. 
Mac OSX is as close as "it just works" as computers get, but this still 
means it's a few lightyears away. :)
