This guy is in my guild.  When I first heard about a six-boxer joining the
guild, I had serious reservations.  But the guy is super-friendly and real
nice.  He plays his main character - the SK in the center of the pic - very
well.  When he brings all his bots along in a raid to get flagged, he
controls them all without a hitch.  Indeed, they provide useful
contributions.

Gomorrha is as far removed from Sam Deathwalker as it is possible to be
while still being a six-boxer that plays EQ.  =)

Incidentally, when I posted a link to this pic on our guild boards, he
mentioned that it's outdated - if you look all his characters are in their
50's, when in fact they are all presently 65.  One day he promises to post a
new pic of his updated control center.
