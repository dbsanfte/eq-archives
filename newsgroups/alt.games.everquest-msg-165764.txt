The obvious answer. Find someone in the guild about your level and send 
them a tell that you're interested in their guild and could you group 
up/tag along a bit to see how they operate. BTW check out Malevolent 
Spirits.. I've been away a bit and haven't talked to any of them in a while 
but they're really good folks. They never tried to cheat me or my wife in 
any way and (since the guildleaders are husband/wife) they have a family 
atmosphere. Check out www. malevolentspirits.com. HTH
