Cost = cost/MB x how_much_they_use.  Those factors you list go into
determining cost/MB.  cost/MB tends to stay pretty much constant as you vary
usage, until usage goes up enough to justify using a fatter pipe, and then
cost/MB goes down.  For each type of pipe, cost/MB has tended to go down over
time.  Hence, Verant's costs should be pretty much a linear function of number
of players online and average bandwidth usage per online player (which should
be roughly proportional to players/zone).
