Yesterday I took one of my infant characters into Felwithe for some
shopping, which was the first time I'd been there in quite some time.
Imagine my surprise when I see that every female caster in the city is
wearing this strange black semi-bondage outfit (this is new models, I
have no idea what the old ones look like now). Anyone have any idea what
this outfit is?
