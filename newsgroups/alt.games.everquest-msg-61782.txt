I like that idea, or how about the ports happen at an exact time (game
time).  Such as at exactly midnight and noon (wouldn't that be about every
45 minutes)?  Something like that would make sense as the moon should be
directly above, or on the opposite side of Norath.
    I also think there should be some sort of graphical effect.  Maybe a set
of sparks (lit up pixels) that are really small and begin forming a larger
sphere or swirling ring or disk on the top of the pyramid platform.  Maybe
have it start in the center, slowly expanding as the time for the port draws
nearer, then when it reaches the edges of the platform (would have to have
the timing right so that would be the time for when the port opens)
everybody on it gets ported away to a central portal or maybe even adjacent
portals on Luclin (like a parallel world effect, depending on which portal
you take is which portal you end up in, higher LV zones port you to their
adjacent higher LV zones on Luclin, maybe something where a map of Norath
showing the port locations would be in scaled proportion to a map of Luclin
and their adjacent ports).
    The idea of a lit up and gradually increasing in size sphere, ring, or
disk (or spiral of some kind, maybe even dome instead of hovering sphere)
would be a great visual timer as well as good effects.  Maybe a graphical
effect/texture like the one used when a druid gates or casts invis or
something (that encircling sphere of blue bubbles like he's caught in a soap
bubble of some kind).  I hope being a portal of some form it looks better
than just a simple disappear (like zoning or leaving after being LD or
camping out).  At least something in comparison to a gate spell.
