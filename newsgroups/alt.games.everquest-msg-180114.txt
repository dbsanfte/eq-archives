Ya when I used to hunt there I never saw them drop.. havent been there since
before PoP

What is the requirements on 4c now?  I remember when it used to be pretty
rough.. like, shaman, warrior, cleric were all vital, the better the gear
the less of a struggle, but always a "dangerous" camp

But hey PoP changed a lot of things, Im 3khp up on my pre-pop figures and im
just a monk.

Still unmezzables?  Still need warr/cle/sham all paying full attention?  Can
I bot it reasonably well?

Wouldn't mind getting a FG too,  girlfs ranger is gonna be 51 soon and it
seems the best option to get a decent agro weapon for her.
