[snip good reasons to take a break]

Oh sure the graphics are better in Real Life (RL) and the world is much much
larger but it has many of the same problems as EQ.

Lag             (traffic, overpopulation)
Camping     (sitting in a cubicle 8-12 hours a day)
Kill Stealing  (co-workers)
Griefers       (your boss)
Downtime    (sleeping)
Beggars        (in large city zones)

Plus, corpse recovery is totally broken.
