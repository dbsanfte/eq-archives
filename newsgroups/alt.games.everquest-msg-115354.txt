This is much like saying you've never seen any mobs wander through the
Druid portal in Skyfire.  I hadn't either until quite recently but
they do.

The reason I say NOT to use the FM melee bind point is that I've known
twice people die, respawn at bind (naked naturally) and then die again
to a wandering mob and then respawn naked.. well where do you think?
Seriously no f**king fun.

Much better to bind outside the bank in FV where you can almost always
beg an invis, SoW, HP buff etc should the unthinkable happen.
