Yes, his dual wield is poor due to his hard level cap not what offhand
weapon he is wielding, it will max out naturally no matter what
although a speedy weapon will help a little in raising skill.  Until
around level 30 it will still be poor so he might as well use the best
ratio weapon he has offhand.

[A 50/20 weapon off hand would make a big difference to his DPS even
if it were to only connect once or twice per minute.  Well, once his
damage level cap is removed at 20 anyway.]

Ack, sorry.  You are correct in what you say that the delay on his
offhand weapon will affect his rate of dual wield firing (or most
often not firing in his case but anyway) but I was looking at his
overall DPS rather than the speed of which his dual wield (or other
weapon) skills would raise.

>Dual Weild happens on offhand weapon delay, yes?

Yes, so a 9/19 offhand weapon would be better than a 12/24 for
*raising dual wield* but would do less damage overall once his dual
wield is in any shape of form effective (level 30 I guess).

Swap them over and the the 9/19 *can* be better due to the mainhand
damage bonus.

Yes, somewhere along the line I confused "raising weapon skills" and
"maximum Damage Per Second".  Never try and compose a reply when
reading something else. /sigh

Dunno.  What I meant to say was that mainhanding faster weapons can be
better than weapons *with better overall ratios* at both DPS AND
raising weapon skills.

See his reply in this thread, put a weapon in *mainhand* and the skill
flies up at early levels, the longer you leave it the more painful it
can be.

Fungus Spine mainhand and Centi LS off is still the best combo, that's
about all I got right last time.  LOL.
