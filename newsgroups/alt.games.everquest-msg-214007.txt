I've been playing on FV for a long time now, but I have terminal
re-rollitus :-)

I currently have the following...

Troilus Briarfoot - 25 Halfling Druid (for Roleplay purposes...my
first halfling)
Xlabik - 18 Gnome Necromancer

I am thinking about re-rolling the necro and starting my barb BL over
again. Khosh was 44 when I scrapped him and rolled a Froglock Wizard
back when LoY came out. The one character limit is brutal hehehe
