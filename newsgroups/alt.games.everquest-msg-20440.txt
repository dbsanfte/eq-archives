Heh - which is exactly why I have the problem of "do I mem buffs, or do I 
mem offensive spells?"  It doesn't help that a) I am night blind and must 
keep snake sight memorized (until I get that ring someone was talking 
about in another thread that gives permanent night vision *drool*) b) 
EVERYBODY in the group wants SoW (can't say I blame them when the need 
arises to run away) c) I usually end up having to help heal and d) most 
of the group likes to have lev cast on them as well.  I've finally given 
up and told them no more levs because I NEED the spell slot for something 
else, but that still leaves only 5 slots left.  Buff or hurt? Buff or 
hurt?  I've tried *asking* my group what they prefer but they always say 
"oh, it's up to you."  So far I've gone with offensive because 99% of the 
time we're not taking a whole lot of damage, and the 1% of the time we 
do, it's usually because of a vast overpull of reds, and that turtle skin 
is only going to drag it out 30 seconds (or like yesterday when the 
puller pulled a sand giant back - ouch.) -  I just dread entering a new 
group one day and hearing "What the hell are you doing??? Where's my 
buffs?!?" :)
