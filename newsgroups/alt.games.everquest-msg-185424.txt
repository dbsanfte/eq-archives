 I too, would like to know where the money tree is.

 Actually, your best bet for pelts, if you are of sufficent level, is
Stonebrunt Mtns. There are NO ruined pelts there. Half the time one kill
will net you two pelts, sometimes three....

 But watch out, there are ALOT of wandering mobs there, you can get
overwhelmed VERY quickly.
