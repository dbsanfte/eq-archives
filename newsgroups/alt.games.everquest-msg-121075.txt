The situation is that my level 53 cleric has been waiting for my level
52 pally friend to be totally through with OWD's (she's gotten her
CoF; at this point she's simply attending to make sure others get
theirs).

Since my normal experience bar is on hold, I'm looking for advice on
where to put the AA points.  I put the first 3 points into Runspeed of
course.  Now what?

A friend of ours maintains that there's no point in putting it into
any attribute, since you will be finding equipment to boost all of
those stats.  He advocates Metabolism, which seems like pretty much a
waste to me.

I lean towards Magic Resistance or Wisdom (to free up slots for other
goodies).

Thoughts?  Thanks.

Oh, also, the pally wouldn't mind advice on what to do with hers :)
