I think that's a good idea. I admit that I'm completely uninterested
in the Test server because I don't like the idea of building up a
character and running the risk of it being wiped. Verant would get a
much richer cross-section of character classes and levels if they were
to implement this.

On the other hand, there may well be compelling technical reasons why
this can't be done. New things being tested on the Test server may be
incompatible with character information from the live servers, which
would require special handling to carry over - meaning more code to
write, change, maintain, and test.
