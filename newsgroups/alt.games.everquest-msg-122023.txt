Thought i would warn you about feign death, it works fine for monks in
fights but for necros it will fail if you have a DoT spell on the mob. From
the mobs point of view, its a case of ok he is dead, time to look for
another player to kill.....Hey wait just a cotton picking minute, that last
guys still hurting me..Ah the old FD trick, well i'll just make him really
dead. So if you have dot'd the mob you need to run away untill the dot wears
off, this includes you darkness line.
