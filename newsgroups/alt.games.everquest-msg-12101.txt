*grin* I don't recall ever seeing a gnome in banded. I've seen quite a
few male gnomes in crafted, though... and once a lady gnome in cleric
gold plate.
Ever since I restarted my female wood elf warrior, it seems I come
across high level wood elf warriors (mostly female) everywhere - and I
never saw one until a couple weeks ago :)
