If you have nothing in your range slot an Ebon War Spear is good. Is a
weapon for primary Dmg 8 dly 31 +4str +3 Wisdom +5sv Magic but fits in range
slot and gives you the stats benefit, just make sure you dont range attack

Then maybe a Jade Prod in primary, you Epic is a piercer and your melee will
begin to diminish from now up. Soloing will consist of root dot and grouping
will see you as a buff/debuff machine
