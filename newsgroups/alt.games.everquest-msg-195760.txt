OK, hunted the halflings in the camp marked on my map as
"halflings" (rumor has it the other camps don't drop what I
need).  Fun spot, a large circle of mixed level halflings, far
enough apart that with care you can single pull, but with roamers
that can add if you time things wrong.  Also, they are aggro to
skeletons and snakes and wolves... which can pull them out of
position; this can be good, making one or another easier to pull
and perhaps injured, and it can be bad, with adds pulled in that
shouldn't be anywhere nearby, because they wandered in range
chasing a wolf!

Those mobs can also KS you if you aren't careful.  All in all its
a very dynamic camp, lots of fun compared to a lot of EQ camping
I've done.

Anyway, the drop rate on woven grass amulets is pretty high,
along with leatherfoot raider caps.  I pocketted quite a number
of each while getting a friend her halfing finger bone drop, then
I went in to do the quest.  Bad news, I'm apprehensive as a
troll, and worse, handing in raider caps won't work with my
faction that low.  I'd killed a -lot- of halflings to no avail.

So off I go to Freeport, using the POK book as reccomended on the
walk thru I was reading.  Running down thru the secret
passageways, I discover that my fat troll butt is too big to
easily jump across the water, which seems to be the only way to
get to EFP that way.  I fall into the water and get completely
chewed up by a -lot- of highly aggro drowned citizens!

I go again, exiting the secret tunnel into the newbie area and
running to EC, thru the tunnel to NRo, and thence to EFP and the
tunnels there.  After a bit of poking around I manage to find
Saxarivsa, who is not on the map, but is next to Opal Darkbriar.
Mark her on the map for future use.  Apprehensive to her as well
but she still gives me a letter for Perrir, which is the plan.

I gate back to Nektulous and thread my way in to Perrir again,
give him the letter.  Amiable, but still not asking for the
raider caps.

This time I run straight down to EC thru Nektulos, took no longer
than doing POK book up and down again, unless theres's an easy
way to use that WFP to EFP tunnel the book idea is just silly.
Run the letter again, and -now- he wants raider caps.  I hand
those in until hailing him finally gives me the symbol quest.
I'm still amiable as I was before the second letter, but
apparantly there's low, medium, and high amiable.

Hand in the amulets and get my initiates symbol easy as that.

Looking ahead, the next quest seems to require killing a level 15
halfling, so its going to be a while before I get step two, and
besides, step three, it says here, won't work until level 16 no
matter what.

So leveling up to 16 is the next goal, I suppose... nice to have
a goal between level 14 and 19 anyway, sort of 'first hell"
period for shaman, when our heals are completely inadequate and
we don't have haste yet.
