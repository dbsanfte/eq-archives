    Nor am I.

    It's more complicated than that. Jury nullification gives 12 people the
power to overturn a law that may have been correct in the eyes of the
majority of the people in a given jurisdiction, "just because". It renders
the law irrelevant, as the jury will instead look at what took place and
decide if they think the facts warrant the mandated punishment. As you'll
see in my example below, where a jury was incited to nullify, it can be very
problematic.

    Here in Canada, one of the most famous attempts to incite to nullify
happened during one of the Morgentaler cases. Dr. Henry Morgentaler was the
foremost abortion doctor in Canada at a time when abortion was illegal.
During one of his trials, his defense lawyer told the jury point-blank that
they could vote to acquit if they didn't think abortion should be illegal,
despite the law, and that the judge could do nothing about it. Judge stops
the trial, declares immediate mistrial. If people in general were more aware
that they could, on a jury, vote any way they please for any reason they
choose, the legal system would be thrown into chaos as verdicts become more
a matter of jury selection than fact of law. That's why nullification is
such a hot topic, not because the "common man" can interpret laws his own
way, but rather because he can ignore them altogether.
