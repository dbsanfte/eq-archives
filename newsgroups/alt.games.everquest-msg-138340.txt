Bad in the hands of citizens or "commoners" is what you really mean. You 
strike me as the kind of liberal scumbag who wants to give all the guns to 
people like John Ashcroft... and Hitlery Clinton, or whatever liberal bozo 
gets elected next, while she institutes gulags (a liberal invention) and 
Stasi and secret police to come and pay visits to innocent people in the 
middle of the night.

I bet you got on your little gun control crusade after reading Mao's little 
red book.
