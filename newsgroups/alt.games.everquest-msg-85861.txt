It's very useful, as are all the AoE DoT songs.  Experiment with it,
and I think you'll agree.

If you want to see a calculation of how much damage it does
at a certain level, go to http://www.eqdiva.com/songs.asp?song=2
Make sure you set the "Level" optionmenu to the level you want
to know about.

At level 11, it does 4 damage per tick without an instrument,
12 per tick with an instrument.

And that increases with level, like many other bard songs.
At 40, for example, the damage done is 12/36.

And it shouldn't be a choice between the Whistling Warsong
and the Chords of Dissonance -- you should be able to play
*both* at the same time.
