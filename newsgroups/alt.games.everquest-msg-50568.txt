Yeah, he has a place holder..

Go down into BB, and cross the first bridge at the bottom of the big
ramp.(The one to the right, not the one towards the elite ledge) Go to the
bottom of the bridge near the water, If you look to the left, just a bit,
there's a small rise, next to the water. Typically, a guardsman will pop
there - it should be the nearest pop to the very bottom of the bridge, next
to the water. (There's a underwater tunnel, almost just below the spawn
point.)

Just kill this guardsmen, eventually the Brewer will pop. I got my first
cask this way, I have yet to get anymore, as it can take some time for him
to pop. You should be able to get a cask in an hour or two though- he's not
an incredibly long pop.
