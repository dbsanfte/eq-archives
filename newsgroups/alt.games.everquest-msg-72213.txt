While you could "live" without them, I highly would recommend that any
new kitties follow through on their citizenship and class quests.  The
former gives  you a reason to explore the city and learn your way
around, though it appears most folks don't bother to read the NPC text
and rely on asking "what do I do now?" in /ooc over and over again. 
From there the class based quests provide impetus for both exploration
and hunting which can keep you involved in tasks that produce items
actually useful at the levels you complete them.  The Iksar quests are
similar, but not as involving in my opinion.  This is one area where
they really are getting better.  Makes me wonder what the game would
have been like if they had such quests in all cities when they first
started, sure would have put the Quest in EverQuest.
