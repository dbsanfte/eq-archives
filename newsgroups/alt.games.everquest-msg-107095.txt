You lucky friggin bastard...  Even with roleplay on...  I get hounded to
port people...  And usually in the middle of kiting to.  My usual response
is...

"Do you see the 'Anon' next to my name.  It is on for a reason.  I'm trying
to grind here, and I can't exactly drop everything to port you at this
time."

Hence my reason for payment for ports about 90% of the time.  I'm taking
time off from grinding for XP to port people around on my time.  And with 7
other characters to 'feed', I could use the money.
