No, but if you are seeing such references recently it may be talking
about something coming with luclin where in the auction zone you can
place prices for items or something and people can call them up
evidently. So it sounds like they could like call up ghoulbane and see
your price, some other guy's price also there, etc. As far as I know
you have to actually be there though for that to happen (you being the
seller I mean) so EQ will still not have anyway for a player to
automate being a vendor.
