Your not grouping with the right beastlords... Go to the beastlords
message board, and most beasts there will say Lemme Tank....
I love to be MT with my beast, as long as the healer is good at what
they do....
in fact, my beast was MT in Plane of Torment at 56, with a group of 60
plus... course I was the only melee, but all went great... Beasts can
hold aggro like an SK / Pally..... now, any SK / Pally worth their
salt can hold aggro from a beast, but if they were in a game of
competition, there would be alot of ping  ponging...

They dont make better damage sponge tanks, but they do hold aggro much
better than the average warrior.  Warrior's are very dependant on
their gear to hold aggro, where SK's and Pallys have spells to grab
and hold aggro.
