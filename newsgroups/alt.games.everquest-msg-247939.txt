  Last weekend was an eventful one. Critical progress was made, starting
with PoJ trials.

  After Adas' last disastrous attempt at a PoJ trial, I had been resigned to
grinding out level 62 in order to get into the Bastion of Thunder. Well,
late Saturday she checks /who all guild and some friends are in PoJ
basement; might as well see if they can use a 61 wizzy and get what loot I
can. I zone in to PoJ and head toward the basement, but don't make it before
getting a tell: "You here for trials?" Well, if you've got room...
  I get down to the Tribunal room where there's two or three groups waiting
around. I get invited to the one at the end of the line and get buffed: C5,
SD, Bot9. Ada is already swooning.   The druid running the group says we
will be using the AE strategy. Well, if you feel comfortable with it.... I
load up Winds of Gelid and my Jyll's line.
  Unfortunately the group ahead of us is using a classical tanking strategy
and is consequently having some trouble succeeding.  We while away the time
with banter. Another group tries one of the other trials: Burning. our druid
accidentally casts the wrong spell and gets DT'ed by the Tribunal. So much
for his C5. The tanking group doing Execution finally wins, forcing another
delay on us.
  Finally, around 4am, we get into the trial site. We choose our corner. The
mobs pop. The warrior tries to take them all on. The rogue gets behind one.
The druid, two clerics, and Adas all pop off a series of AE's. Adas is
wasting mana on this; they go down too fast. Gleeful that this will be an
easy win, I sit and med for the next wave.
  It comes. Adas gets aggro, gets dogpiled, and dies. After the wave is down
one of the clerics clicks her. This only brings her back to the Tribunal
room; after the third wave she gets clicked again to the trial site. She can
only sit and med helplessly while the fourth wave falls without her help. Do
you know how depressing that can be for a wizard?
  Finally, the warrior is running the executioner around the room. With no
mana regen buffs Adas is still running on fumes when we engage, able to
throw only a couple of Lures. In the end, however, the executioner falls,
and Adas gets her Mark of Execution. Now back to Mauvin...
  My guildies are still in the basement, but we can't wait for them to clear
all the mobs; we dive right in. I let Adas med, and she gets left behind.
She tries to catch up and gets killed by the guard; clicked again, then
"Hail, Mauvin" and the character flags. No AA points yet; she hasn't gone
through the converstion with the dwarf in PoK, dosen't have her planar
charm. So, when mana permits, she goes there. Yay! First AA point down! I
spend it on Run1 and log for the night.
  Sunday, I catch "Troy" at the movies and get a late start to my playing
day. Adas gets into PoV outer camp and works immediately on 100% AA
experience: she is only two and a half blue bubbles from dinging, after
having done experiments here and there over the past few weeks in AAXP
values of some mobs. Soon enough she earns her second AA point, which is
still banked. Then, as she's close to 62, she switches to 100% normal
experience and plays the rest of the day at that camp, grinding all the way
up to halfway through 62.

  Now Adas is grouping in BoT - when there's a cleric and slower available.
Observing her AA earnings, half a blue bubble a kill, I suspect AA points
might have been earned faster somewhere else, at a lower level. Rabotev will
find out for sure. The next few weeks will be spent at 62, trying to find
the best AA camps: Nadox, perhaps, for soloing; Velk's; ME; Umbral; the
Grey. Any suggestions?

  As to what to spend her points on, it seems easy enough: first Run3, then
mental clarity, then SCF, SCM, SCFM, and back to various basic abilities
like Intelligence, Agility, Dexterity, Stamina, Strength, MR, First Aid,
regen. I want her to be a Mistress for a long time; it seems an appropriate
title.

  So, in an important sense, Adas has Arrived. She can run with the big
dogs.
