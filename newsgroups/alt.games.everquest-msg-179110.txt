depends on what mobs you playing with.  Some aren't rootable, some aren't
stunnable ( in the higher levels ).  Some aren't mezzable, and some aren't
charmable.
Okay, so lets put your brillant plan to work.  You hopefully were smart
enough to at least get SOE ( or invest 100 K for a fast horse ) and some
extra HP buffs to start your solo escapade which if it doesn't work out well
could easily lead to death.  Hopefully you don't start out tashing unless
you make sure your able to land charm before it smacks you.  So now you got
the mob charmed.  You sick it on another critter.  You going to haste your
pet and hope it doesn't attack you.  either way, if charm breaks, your in
trouble.  rooting the other mob at least allows you to not have two hitting
you, unless both charm and root breaks at the same time.  So now you got two
critters beating on each other.  do you slow the other mob?  if you do then
it won't hurt your charmed mob as much.  and if it does manage to get to you
its hitting less.  If you haste your charmed mob ( which appearantly had to
be nerfed because it was too lucrative in that exp gained outweighed exp
lost with this method ) and charm breaks, its hitting you hasted.  these
mobs are dangerous.  they hitting for 250's to 500 each swing and swing
multiple times.  You might have a few runes up, but in a about one volley
expect that to go down and you might have a few K hitpoints that is like 2
volleys you got to area mezz around you fast, or charm, or run, etc.  Its
easy easy easy to die solo-ing for an enchanter.  If you practice the
methods alot, you might manage to work out a method to die less and make
good exp, but without that snare ability its dangerous.  If you talk to a
solo-ing enchanter he will tell you how great exp can be, but that is if
everything works out.  Even the best solo-ing enchanters die.
I was talking to a solo-ing enchanter who was 63rd, was rooting and dotting,
and got great exp on one kill.  Was like why group, this is great.  While
I'm talking to him thinking about doing it myself, he ends up dead.  I tried
it, ended up getting two instead of one.  Even with a pet up to grab one
other one wasn't expected and wasn't worth the chance of dying at 20 percent
health and runes gone.
If you knew what you were talking about you wouldn't be asking questions,
you would be giving answers.  A 65th enchanter who has solo'ed all his life
would tell you its not as easy as a snaring class.
