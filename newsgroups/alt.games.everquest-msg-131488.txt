1.8 billion.  Which is far less than we give many other countries.  As a
result, we get a stable democracy in the region; a ready base of operation,
should it be necessary; and an extremely effective ally without the need to
station U.S. servicemen over there.  Given the benefits, Isreal is our
greatest investment yet.  Also, the aid is often in the form of products,
meaning working Americans... bonus.
