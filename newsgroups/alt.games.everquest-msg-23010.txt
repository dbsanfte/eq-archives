today i was in a group in paw. and with me was a wizard level 31 and he no
robe on it looked like he was on a corpse run. except when i inspected him
he had 4 or 5 items that i knew to be no drop and nothing else. i ask him
about it and he says
"one day i just logged on and this was all i had left" my no drop items and
zero coin left."
i say"sounds like you been hacked, DONT TELL a gm or you will get banned"
