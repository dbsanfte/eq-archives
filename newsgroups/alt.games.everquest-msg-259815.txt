Been thinking(bad I know)
They do have 100,000 level 1 people basically starting at the same time. As
people level and move up at differing paces, dont you think the over-camp
thing might change?

The game area is very huge and missions are in the thousands............I
think it's a matter of Friday night traffic leaving the City for the
Cottages...
Once they get 1 hour out, the traffic starts to thin and driving becomes
much smoother and quicker.

Wishful thinking? Probably but I also want to give Blizzard the benefit of
doubt at this stage.
