*snorts*  yeah, right.  There's no dibs here, if he wanted that thing
camped, he should have been there *himself*.

Kinda reminds me of all those idiots pulling stuff to outside the
Ry'for fort in EW, who get pissy when someone actually has the balls
to step *into* the fort and take it.  If you ain't there, then you
ain't camping it, bottom line.
