As a cleric, you probably want to pump up your tradeskills, if for
nothing else, the Thurgadin prayer shawl quests.  If you only do the
first three quests, you'll end up with a very nice ranged slot item.
If you have enough patience to build up your trade skills quite a bit,
the 7th and 8th prayer shawls are very nice.  I have a 53 cleric, and
have been working towards the 5th (tailoring is only 55 at the moment,
but it's getting there).  I know that there are a few other quests
that also require tradeskills, but the prayer shawl quests are the
most popular.

Specialization goes up fast enough by iitself.  If you need it to go
up faster, just keep on practicing low-mana alteration spells during
your downtime.  I specialized in Abjuration, so I just kept casting
minor healing over and over again.
