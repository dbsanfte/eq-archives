I agree, my 63 hammer does around 30 - 40 damage each hit (double for
undead) and procs once ever 3-4 hits for 90 - 150 points, it is good dps.
But if the fight is not going well, always med for the CH or any heal rather
than hit the mob, the tank will usually out DPS a cleric and will need the
heal.
