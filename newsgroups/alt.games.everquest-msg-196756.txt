Planetside is cool.  Very cool.  *If* you came to EQ from
Quake/Tribes/Halflife.  If you came to EQ from UO/muds, you will wonder why
anybody likes it.

The staying power of PS is questionable.  But then again, maybe it's just an
issue of it can be a 10-hour a week game rather than the common 30-hour
weeks put in by your average uber-guildee (or more).

And they've still got a *lot* of work to do.  Crash issues, framerate
issues, etc.  Nothing unexpected there in a new game, but definitely hope
they get them fixed up before release.

The best description of the game is "Tribes deluxe, with persistency".
