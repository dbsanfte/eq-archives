Well, as far as that goes, it was 15-20 mins. max. waiting or riding.

Additionally, if you wanted to get with friends, my guess is you would do 
so early on and stay there if the trip took a while. When it's part of the 
normal game experience, you tend to plan for it or otherwise compensate, as 
you would do in an immersive adventure setting.

That would never work. Even if people believe it to be the best solution, 
they will take the shortcut 9 times out of 10. People want instant 
gratification, not necessarily what's best for them or the game.

I've said it before, any game that tries to be all things to all people 
will do well at none.
