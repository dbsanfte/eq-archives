Lol, my not cool at all!  My wife doesn't actually play though.  She's a
born-again Christian, so many times while I play she stands next to me
screaming about Satan, playing Satanic games, and Hell.
So not fun at all.
I may be going to Hell, but at least I'll be with most of my friends, and
the music will be cool.

Sean...
