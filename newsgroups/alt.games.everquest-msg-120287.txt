I just finished that exercise myself. My wizard killed nothing but
wolves and frost giant scouts in GD from level 34 to level 39. That got
me *just* over the line to Ally with the dwarves. I was still glaring to
the dragons. Then I went on one Kael raid to the bank for two or three
hours. Now max ally to Coldain and apprehensive to dragons. 

Get thee into Kael on a busy weekend day and ask politely if you can tag
along with a raid for faction (if you're not in a guild that raids
Kael.) That will fix you up quickly.
