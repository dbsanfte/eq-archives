Hmm, is it possible that you're using a WinModem rather than a
hardware modem?  (A WinModem uses the CPU of the computer to do most
of the heavy lifting part of the communication, a hardware modem has
it's own processor that does it.  WinModems have a number of odd
problems, generally problems that show up when the processor is busy
doing something else, like loading 500meg of textures or something.)
I would borrow an external modem if you're unsure of the difference,
or get a basic 3Com Sportster 56k internal.  If you have money to
burn, or access to someone who does, I would recommend a MultiTech or
3Com Courier 56k, just for the additional troubleshooting you can do
with them, but I wouldn't worry about this until you've verified that
you have a hardware modem.
