I have a AMD Athalon 1600 system and I just replaced a Matrox G400
with an ATI 8500 card. When I tried to set it up I could only run EQ
in the 1024 X 768 mode which made the active area of the screen too
small......... When I tried to run it in the "Standard " mode 0f 640 x
480 it either hung up or when I got to the game going the graphic were
awful. Others have had great success with this card so the problem is
me, what am I not doing right????
   Help plse
