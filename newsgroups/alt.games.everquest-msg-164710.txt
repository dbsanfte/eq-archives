Translation (By Axe Gajin);

Since the release of EQIM a few weeks ago we have received a lot complaints,
flames and general bitching about this new EverQuest feature. The most
common comment was "YOU ALL SUCK!!!." At its launch we had planned on EQIM
fees to offset its development cost. We just aren't making enough money as
it is, all these millions of doallars of profit just aren't cutting it. (did
you know Porsche is releaseing a SUV?)
We also realized the EQIM isn't quite finished yet and we can't be bothered
to iron out all the bugs. So rather then let you pay for it and leave us
vunrable to more complains. We drop it on you for free so you can sort out
the mess yourself.

A big thanks to the EQ community old and new for their support of the world
of Norrath. Please enjoy your free EQIM. And don't bother mailing us if it
crashes your system, we a re not resposible (SUCKERS!)
