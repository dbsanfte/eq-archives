Having run out of levels, I'm finally going to have to start putting 
time into AA's. Originally I just did the generals and SCM for 
archtypes.  There's quite a few tastey AA abilities for wizards in 
Class, PoP Advance and PoP ability.  I'm just curious if anybody's 
experience has shown which ones are the absolute "must haves" and how 
they worked out for them. (I've read the ratings on Graffe's but more 
than one opinion is always nice, and many of them are ranked equally.

Stuff I'm looking at and how I'm initially leaning:
Class AA's
Must Haves: Improved Familiar, Exodus
Maybe later: SCFM, Quick Damage, Manaburn

PoP Advanced
Must haves: Advanced Inate Intelligence
Maybe later: The various buffs to resists

PoP Abilities
Must haves: Harvest of Druzzil, Allegiant Familiar
Maybe later: Fury of Magic Mastery

So distilling that down, I'm thinking the first ones to get, in order, 
might be Harvest of Druzzil, Improved Familiar, Exodus, Allegiant 
Familiar, Inate Intelligence.

But then again, not having played with any of them, I may be totally off 
base here as to what will be the most effective and/or useful.
