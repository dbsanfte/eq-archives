That's part of your charm. I'm often charming in much the same way.

I'm not really sure what they can (or rather, will) do except in
extreme cases. Some anti-biotics perhaps, or pain killers, but they're
only going to pull out the Sonic Blaster Big Guns in the case of a
large, blocked stone.

I found that the most comfortable position was standing, and walking
or running. In fact, I won a corn-maze race a few hours after my
kidney stone pain hit me full on. I was miserable already, so I
figured I may as well get hot, sweaty and eaten by bugs.

Ultimately, my stone broke up so I made a nice little pile of sand.
Maybe the several hours I spent pounding on my back (an awkward place
to reach with any real force, btw) helped. 

As for the water, I suggest cranberry juice. Acidic, you know. Not too
bad with vodka, either.
