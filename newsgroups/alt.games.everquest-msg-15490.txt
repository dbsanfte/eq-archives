 True, but if a player changes his or her password and forgets it or writes 
it down incorrectly Verant treats it just like you gave the password away
and will not give you the password. 
 
 A level 52 Warrior friend did just this. She changed her password one day
and forgot what it was the next time she tried to log on. Calling Verant
customer service was useless because she had lost the CD case with the 
account key on it. Verant will not help her and she still cannot play. 
They have essentially banned her account simply because she lost her account
key number. Her account is not usable by her now. She did not give out the 
password, she did not sell her account. Verant can easily tell that nobody 
has logged into the account for over a month yet they will not give her her 
password.
 
 This is absolutely rediculous.
