But it -is- part of the Antonica continent, and you do get it included with
original EQ, no expansions needed.

Apparantly the LDoN dungeons do count, and they are both newer than 
Jaggedpine and require an expansion, a fairly recent one at that.

Anyone checked Warrens and Stonebrunt?  Both those are, like Jaggedpine, 
zones that are part of an original EQ continent (Odus, in this case), 
added for free in a patch.
