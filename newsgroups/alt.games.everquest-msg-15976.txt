Well, this is not necessarily true because EQ pvp is widely reguarded as a
joke.  It was just added into the game as an afterthought it seems and never
really developed.  There is also little stopping grief play on the pvp
servers and it is almost an all-out free for all.  I do not believe people
would enjoy that type of game either.  In DAoC, Horizons, AO, etc... the pvp
does seem to be controlled and avoided easily if you wish.  I am sure people
would rather prefer that.
