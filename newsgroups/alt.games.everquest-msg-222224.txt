Start getting your fletching up,then when its around 100 do the trueshot
long bow quest it may take several tries,or you may luck out and get it on
the first try(I read somewhere of a guy who got it on the firs try with a
fletching of 80)
The stats are really good.A lot of traveling is involved and be careful on
the "sister islands" as there is a pirate there that has an agro range that
must cover the whole island.He is tough for his level and as he is a rogue
never turn your back to him.
