Your wrong the codes on the mag where unique and getting someone else's will
just give you a code already used message. besides it is only a 15 day trial
so not worth all the hassle you can pick up the box set of everquest,
luclin, velious and kunark for ï¿½30 from the electronics boutique and IMHO
the game isn't very good with standard everquest.
