I had something like this happen to me before, except I somehow got back in
time and picked up my stuff
and there was this one time in Halas, I left the bags out in the open sorta,
cause they seemed to blend in with the wagon... logged in my mule and
quickly picked up and destroyed as neccesary, because I found some newbie
was standing in front of my collection and picked up a bag =P
luckily it was an empty 8 slot
