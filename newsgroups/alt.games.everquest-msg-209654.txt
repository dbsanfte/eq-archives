A mere 2 weeks into my probation period with my old guild, Rakyn and I
concluded that we weren't getting quite the warm fuzzies we had expected
from the guild, and nor would it change any time soon due to the guild
being a Euro guild.  One cannot accrue warm fuzzies with people in
different time zones...they must already be present.

In any case, I am now in a bit of a fix because the item I most want in
this game is something that I need a bit of a force to get.  A guild force
really, since I am not uber, and I make friends slowly (so that "grab your
friends and do it" option isn't, well, an option).  I can't just save up
my platinum and buy the thing. 

Or can I?

Money seems to be able to get over any obstacle, so why not offer money
for looting rights on a no drop weapon?  Folks sell MQs, so why not this?

Hmmmmm....

So...question for those of you with more experience than I.  The weapon I
want is that fairly common drop from Auliffe Chaoswind in a BoT tower, the
Greatstaff of Four Winds.  I want it because I'm one of those stinky RPers
that has decided she must only weild staff-like weapns, and frankly...SOE
disagrees with me and hasn't created many staff-like weapons that a ranger
can use.  I'm stuck at my 37/36 amy staff, and lemme tell you...my friends
with their windblades and whatnot are passing me fast. So yes, the
Greatstaff is my only fair upgrade. That, and it's purty to.

So I'm trying to figure out how much platinum would be fair.  The staff is
41/31.  The 42/34 monk/bst tradeable staff, staff of flowing water, is
going for 80k on my server last I saw.  So would 100k be worth a group or
two's time to escort me past the locked tower door to a corpse?  
More...less?

Also...am I being completely loony in thinking that I'd really need to
loot the staff before I pay? If I give 100k to some folks and they cheat
me, I'm out 100k and I have no easy way of "making them suffer" (there are
more of them than me).  If they let me loot and I fink out, they are out
some time and an item they didn't have in the first place...and it's
easier for 6-20 folks to defame one woman.  I'd do a 'Half first, half
after" deal, but carrying around that much platinum isn't really an option
in BoT. 

Suggestions, comments, flames?
