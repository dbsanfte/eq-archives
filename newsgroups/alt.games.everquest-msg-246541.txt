Has anyone worked out the new regen rates yet?  I've seen scattered
numbers mentioned (as in, "my rogue was getting 24/tick!"), but no
indication of how long it takes for the numbers to get that big, etc.

So to get the ball rolling, I took my two modest characters and got
some numbers.  (I found that jumping down the spiral stairwells in
PoK did zero damage to my monk due to Safe Fall, but the elevator to
to the library "penthouse" could easily do 1000 damage.  And only
once did I get hit a geometry bug and fall down the elevator shaft
for 20000hp.  Ouch.  Good thing there are lots of friendly clerics
passing through PoK.  But I digress. :-)

The first and most startling thing I noticed was that STANDING regen
seems to have changed.  I'm pretty sure my Iksar Monk used to get
3/tick at level 31, just as various web sites say to expect.  And
I hadn't really checked, but I figured my Druid was getting 1/tick.
But when I check them now, after the patch, I find the Druid is
healing 2/tick while standing, and the Monk a whopping 8/tick.  (And
yes, that's with spell buffs, no tribute buffs, no item buffs.  The
monk actually got 12/tick because I had +4 regen via tribute, but I
checked it again after turning that off and verified the 8/tick.)

First off, I tried getting the monk down 700-800 hits (the things I
do for science!) and watched the healing rate.  I did it twice, once
with all my gear (1062 max hp), once naked (702 hp).  The healing
rates were the same in terms of raw numbers (N/tick), so it does NOT
appear to be a percentage of total hits per tick, unless there's a
percentage that acts as a cap or something.

In both cases, the monk healed an extra 2/tick for the first 20 ticks
(two minutes) after sitting.  (So when I had the +4 regen from tribute
it was 14/tick.)  Then the rate went up by another 8/tick (to 22/tick)
for one minute, then 30/tick for the next minute, at which point I was
within 32 of max so I don't know how much it tried to heal next.  The
"acceleration" of 8-per-tick-per-minute looked perhaps related to the
new basic regen of 8/tick standing, but that wasn't borne out with the
druid.  Tonight I'll try it again without the tribute regen, which
should let me verify the next increment.

The druid, with 2/tick standing, went to 3/tick sitting, then to 4/tick
after only ONE minute.  After another minute it leaped to 9/tick, then
13, then 18, and finally 22 before I reached max hp.  So the rate of
acceleration seems to be about 4.5 per tick per minute for her.

At first it seemed odd that it took two minutes for the monk's healing
to start accelerating, and only one minute for the druid, but it could
just be some sort of roundoff effect.  I.e., both of them started
seeing the real acceleration start after two minutes; the druid's regen
only went up by 1/tick after one minute.

So in short, the druid's healing rate after N minutes of sitting was
4.5 x N, rounded down, except it was 3/tick after 0 minutes (and was
2/tick standing), while the monk's, after subtracting the tribute buff,
was (8 x N) + 2, and was 10/tick the first minute, and 8/tick standing.

Anybody else willing to jump off cliffs in the pursuit of knowledge?
(If people want to just send me their data, with race/class/level info
included please, I'll correlate it and post the results.  Or people can
discuss it here in typical anarchic newsgroup fashion. :-)
