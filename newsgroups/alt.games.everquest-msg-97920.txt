Tried that, doesn't work :( I select Abilities on the main menu, then right
click on one of the (empty) buttons, and left click an ability from the
ensuing pop-up window. Works fine for e.g. "Sense Heading" but for slam
nothing happens (i.e. the button stays empty).

I would have thought that 2HB was the way to go, but I'll try focusing on
piercing and 1HB.
