One question here... was it travelling at agro-speed or normal-speed?
Not important really, but I admit to being curious.

They could have started casting before you even stood up. Annoying,
yes, but that's one of the benefits of casting class; long range agro.

You attack it; if it didn't retaliate then it is already agroed. By
fighting it, you are in effect KSing.

a genuine mistake. Both parties should have let the matter drop.
