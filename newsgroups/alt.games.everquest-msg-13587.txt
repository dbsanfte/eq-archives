Enough, apparently - the question is answered by looking at how often
this kind of theft actually occurs. Damn near never.

A security system doesn't *have* to be unbeatable to be effective. It
just has to be good enough to discourage people from bothering.

Example - A nice high-tempered steel Club on your steering wheel isn't
really a great security device - it's easily circumvented simply by
sawing through the steering wheel. But that takes time, and triggers
the effort vs reward equation, which is why the Club is a *effective*
security device.



I'd meant, by the way, to thank you for your non-confrontational
approach to this. I know we've butted heads before, and I do
appreciate that you asked questions without firing off an attack
first.
