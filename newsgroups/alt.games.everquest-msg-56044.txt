I -do- explore. If I didn't I'd never get in a group or leave my home 
zone. But I learn the zone I plan on hunting in BEFORE I go lfg. I didn't
always, but the first time I got dumped from a group because I couldn't
FIND them was the last time I ever put myself in that position.

Still can. And come to think of it, one of the tricks I used as a raw noob
before I got sense heading to a point it was useful would work even better
in a new zone. Get a couple of stacks of summoned daggers. When dropped, a
dagger -always- points straight north.
