You know, while eqinterface.com has a lot of very nice skins... the one
thing that's really missing are some really ornate, graphical fantasy UIs.
There are a lot of UIs that claim to be fantasy-themed but all they really
are is the same basic, simple, square windows with fancy borders.  I mean,
small, campact, and efficient is good and all, but frankly I'm not playing
the game to be as efficient and scientific as possible... what I want is
eye-candy :)

So... if anyone here has any UIs that you think are something like what I'm
looking for, or know someone who does, or can tell me what to look for on
eqinterface to find it (I'm looking for UIs like the StoneAngel UI on
eqinterface)... please post in this thread and let me know.  I have four
different characters and I want a different UI for each.  I'm already using
Oguler's Beastlord UI for my BL, and the StoneAngel 2.0 UI (I modified it to
work with the current .xml files) for my pally... I need two more.  Tried
using Athees's DragonUI but I find it a little ugly.  I'd make some myself
but I'm not very good at graphics... as a matter of fact, if someone could
point me to some graphics resources that I might be able to use in my UIs
I'll make my own.

Thanks in advance.
