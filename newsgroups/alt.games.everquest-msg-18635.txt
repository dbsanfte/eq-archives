Nope, IE thinks that there is an update/upgrade, and until you
download/install it.... will keep trying to force feed it to you.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there

apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
