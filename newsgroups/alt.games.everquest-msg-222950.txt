Lucy doesn't put a class on Cataclysm of Ro but it looks like a boss ae
of some sort. Not sure who cast's it because I haven't seen this
particular one which in the Time pantheon narrows it down to Innoruk or
Quarmm. At a guess I'd say Quarmm because I've heard Inno's is a fear.
Look at that resist adjust. *shudder* 18 counters is 2 more than rc3 too
so it's not going away easily either.

3:  Decrease HP when cast by 3000 
4:  Decrease Mana by 100 per tick 
5:  Increase Curse Counter by 18
