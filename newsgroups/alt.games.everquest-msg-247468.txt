From the article:

"Online games such as Sony Corp.'s "EverQuest" and Microsoft Corp.'s
"Asheron's Call" charge players by the month, but the audience for such
titles is limited to several hundred thousand die-hard fans.

At this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, publishers big
and small buzzed about how the proliferation of game consoles and PCs with
high-speed Internet connections opened up new opportunities for selling
extras such as additional levels and exotic digital weaponry."

Please note the "game consoles and PCs" line.
