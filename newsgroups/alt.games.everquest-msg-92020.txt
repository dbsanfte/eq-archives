I tried that. I ran the 'dxdiag' program, and the Direct3D test failed
with this message:

Direct3D test results: Failure at step 5 (GetDeviceCaps): H
RESULT = 0x8876086a (3D not available). 

I have also noticed the requirements for EQ are 8MB of video RAM, I only
have 2. I'll just get a better graphics card before I try installing again.

Thanks,

Marc
