I saw the film recently, yes its a good film. Very good in fact, but with
all films that come from a book they can never seem to get that epic feeling
that the LoTR books have. Else the first film would have been 8hrs long ;)
And it was annoying that there are some holes in the story, like when they
let Bill the donkey go. Bill was featured a lot in the book, little niggle I
know but that scene just seemed to be put in for the sake of it.

As for the other Tolkien books, J.R.R only done the first 4 books, IE the
Hobbit and the 3 LoTR. He also did a book of short stories called Tree and
Leaf. The other books that have Tolkiens name on them are 'cash in's' done
by his son. Sadly his son is not a good story teller and doesnt seem to have
his fathers imagination.

Well thats my 2 pence worth.
