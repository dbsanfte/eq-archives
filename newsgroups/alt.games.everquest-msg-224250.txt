The "Wired" web page has an article online titled, "Laying down the
virtual law".  The first two paragraphs:

====================

You're a dwarf in a virtual world, and that troll over there has just
defamed you in front of everyone. So can you sue, or is it all just
fun and games? 

That's what a collection of the brightest thinkers and best designers
of games like EverQuest, and metaverses like There and Second Life,
will be talking about in New York starting Thursday. They're gathering
for the first State of Play: Law, Games and Virtual Worlds conference.
