I remmebr a guy making me some banded, and his friend filled in my
armor with odd pieces of ringmail!

I started a new char on Rallos zek, equipped ringmail and stuff at 5th
level, and I have a Giant Militia Sword, substandard, but mine all
mine.

I have no problems getting cash at 5th, spiderling silks sell in
tenths of a second with a ooc for a plat each. Thats now I bought my
schtuff.
