My vague memory of CA ones is that it was somewhere on some backwater 
county road that nobody in their right mind uses anyway.  It may actually 
have been intended to keep farm equipment off the road.  But the memory is 
pretty vague, anyway. :)

I hate getting stuck behind those bigass soil tiller things that are as 
wide as both lanes of the road and move 2 miles an hour...
