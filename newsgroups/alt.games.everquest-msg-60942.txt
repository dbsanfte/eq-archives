Kith is bad, but not *that* bad.  What drops a level 50+ in a
heartbeat there?  Worst I've found at level 52 as a Wizard (not known
for our AC and HP, so we drop pretty fast) are things that HT for a
good fraction of my HP, but running away works against them (by level
50, one should have jboots or tboots, if one is not a SOW class or a
Bard).
