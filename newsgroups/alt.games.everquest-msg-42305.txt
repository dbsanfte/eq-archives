Well, with the architecture used by MMORPGs, you have to have a big
server farm with an impressive internet connection, but it is not
clear that that is the only architecture that would work.

As high speed connections become more common, it might be possible to
do an MMORPG where most of the work is actually done on the client
machines, with statistical methods used to catch cheating attempts.

The central servers would mainly be used to create and validate items,
and to do random auditing of the client PCs to make sure that the
clients were not cheating.

Designing something like that would be a fun research project,
combining distributed computing and some interesting crytographic
protocols (e.g., I think some of the digital money schemes would be
useful for handling items).
