The monitor glare can cause head aches and such..also play with the room lit
alittle more ( more light in computer area )  also maybe u need a small
prescription of glasses just to use when on computer and such like myself...
I used to get headaches alot when on computer in the dark or at night. I
wear my glass's while on comp now and it helps alot. Can also try one of
those tinted lense things you can out over your monitor...These are  only
suggestions..If they dont help, its not worth your health to play a
game..see a doctor, ask questions...visit websites and leave questions on
forums where maybe a doctor can answer...goodluck
