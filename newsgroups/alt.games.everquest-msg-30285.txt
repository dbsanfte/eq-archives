Mmm....rat sandwich...

The "exploits" prize I mentioned was actually for dupe bugs (a specific kind
of exploit 8) ), but I found this reference in Google from eqvault's cut &
paste of a message on the old Boards from 7 September 2000 (which postdates
Ken's unfortunate experience):

Hello all,

For those who are new to online games, a "dupe" is a bug that allows a
player to "duplicate" or "copy" items, creating two items where once there
was one. We've heard some reports that there may be a dupe bug somewhere in
game. While we're confident that we do not have any current issues of this
type, we'd like to provide an incentive to everyone to report such things
should they become aware of them.

The FIRST person to submit reproduction steps for any dupe bug will receive
the following: a) A free EverQuest account. We'll mark your current account
as free, or provide you with a new, free account, and b) Subject to approval
by us, the title of your choice will be applied to one of the characters on
your account.

To qualify, you must include all of the information below. Furthermore, THE
REPRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE CLEAR, CONCISE, AND PRESENT LOGICAL STEPS
ALLOWING OUR TEST DEPARTMENT TO REPRODUCE THE BUG. Send an email with a
subject line of "Dupe Bug Report" to eqmail@verant.com containing the
following:

1. Station Name
2. Real Name
3. Phone Number (Day and Evening)
4. Primary Play Server
5. Primary Character Name
6. Complete reproduction instructions.

"Dupe Bug Reports" will only be considered if they contain all necessary
elements of information including complete instructions for reproducing the
bug. While we appreciate notification of all potential problems, only
concrete first-hand experiences will be considered for the award.

-Gordon
