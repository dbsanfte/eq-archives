Right.  Even if the agreement included all the guilds that were capable at
the time of waking him, what happens as more guild become powerful enough?
Eventually, one of them is going to decide that the Luclin loot is good
enough, or that PoP will likely introduce loot better than ST, and so the
fun of waking the Sleeper is more attractive than farming ST.

If the agreement was "all guilds in the agreement will hold off waking the
Sleeper forever, so we can all farm as much as possible before someone
outside the agreement comes in and wakes him", then the guild that broke the
agreement is a bunch of dishonest bastards.

However, if the intent of the agreement was NOT that the participating
guilds would hold off forever, but rather one of those guilds would
eventually wake the Sleeper, and the agreement did NOT specify how it would
be determined when that would happen and which guild got to do it, then I
have no problem with a guild realizing that the agreement is fatally flawed
and withdrawing from it.
