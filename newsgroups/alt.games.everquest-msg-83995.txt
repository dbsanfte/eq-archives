Actually, the name either is or is not offensive, depending on
the race of the player with that name.

Perhaps you hadn't noticed, but the N-word is only offensive
when non-blacks use it.  When blacks use the N-word, it's often
a sign of familiarity, solidarity, and brotherhood.  Almost
affectionate.

Therefore, I'd say, if the player with that name is black, the
name is okay.  If the player with that name is not black, the
name is offensive.
