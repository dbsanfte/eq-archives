I know what you're asking, but you asked it in a confusing manner...

Short answer:  Any exp you gain between your death and a subsequent
rez is not lost in any way.  The following two scenarios leave you
at exactly the same final exp total:

  1.  Die, get rezzed, kill stuff to earn another 1000 exp points.

  2.  Die, kill stuff to earn another 1000 exp points, get rezzed.

Think of it this way -- when you die, "X" experience points are
taken from your character and "stored" on your corpse.  Rezzing
doesn't care how many exp your character might have gained or
lost prior to the rez happening.  All it does is take the
"X" experience points that are "stored" on your corpse and
add "N" percent of them to your current exp grand total.
