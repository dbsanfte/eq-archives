bare with me for a sec, i'm pulling hair out of my skull (the top part) -

i parse a char i haven't played (monk, druid, ranger) to check off where i
left

love the parse, btw


i play, gain some exp in certain skills, go to check up on progress at end
of session (usually) -

GRR, log parser 'performs illegal' and shuts down after seeming to parse
through 85% of the log

this has happened for my 4th time tonight, so i was wondering what it was


hey, i'll give you 10pp on fennin for any leads,
joking,
chris
