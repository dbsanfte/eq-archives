It is on E'ci.  It took me about 4 hours of sitting there.  Several others
sat there the full time.

er... you said the other night that you had all your pieces multiquested?

In any event, most people do have a problem getting it.

E'ci public raiders.  In particular, a wizard in our guild that spent 11
hours camping him.  (complaining loudly in /gu the entire time...)

And, well...opinions are like...

Thats nice.  As I said, I've gotten it easily too.  Doesn't make it more
common.

Not always up.   Easier to check on than Kaesora, but still out of the way.

Easy to get, yes.  Time consuming, yes.  Kaesora isn't exactly "right off
the Nexus".   And as for not contested, it took me two trips before I found
it up, and one aborted trip when someone mentioned in chat that they had
just gotten it a few hours ago.

Yes.  The same three that trio-ed real VS, I suppose, that you say are not
uber at all.   Whatever.   Let me know when reality hits.

Yes, I did forget Verix.  He is rare enough, 20 - 25ish minute spawn time,
so even though he isn't as rare of as spawn as Rotting Skeleton or Pained
Soul, he still can take several hours to pop.

Niblek and the Burnished Wooden Stave were left off on purpose.   Niblek is
a 15 - 20 minute fight in to get to, if you don't just have a non-kos pull
him to zone.  The BWS can be bought in the bazaar for 50 pp.
