The game is playable and fun, but far from perfect or complete.  I won't be
playing at launch, but I know many that will, and I understand their choice.

It depends on how core to the game you think these things are, and how much
you are annoyed by changes to a live game.  If your philosophy is that the
game is never finished, and you're going to be seeing changes (including
major ones) for the next few years as they learn what their playerbase
wants and experiment with mechanics and content to keep it fresh,
then the game is quite ready for release.

If your philosophy is that a game must be substantially complete, with no
expectation of anything but small bugfixes ever, then the game is not ready
for release.  However, I suspect no MMO will be ready for release for you
until it's been out 6 months to a year, and many never will be.  Fortunately,
there's no harm in waiting that long for things to settle down.

I can think of only a few reasons to buy a game like this at release
(actually, any game, but especially online ones), and all of them include
the knowledge that things will be unsettled for a few months.  If that isn't
fun for you, and the other reasons you play don't outweigh it, you
shouldn't buy it.
