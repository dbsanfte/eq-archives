Depends how much you want to spend...

If money's no object...
Blade of Carnage/Sceptre of Destruction

40-100k range
Wavecrasher/Crescent Blades of Luclin

20-40k range
Crescent Blades of Luclin/Frostbringer

10-20k range
Silken whip of Ensnaring/Frostbringer

<10k
Defiance/Silken Whip of Ensnaring

Silken whip procs snare, which is VERY high agro (speaking from a druid PoV,
trust me on this, I play a 60 druid and 55 war), and usually no more than 1k
or so.  Frostbringer is decent agro, I tried one once but resold it because
I didn't like the dps output on it compared to whatever I had at the time.

Warrior currently has CBoL/Tae Ew bloodletters sword, working on saving up
for a Wavecrasher (or taking people into SG for one ^_^ )
