Just another typical DT response to when they are once again shown to be a 
moron instead of the witty thing they think they are.  Just like your response 
will be to this one, no matter how flippant you make it.

Here it is in simple form:

1) People filter crossposts because they are spam.
2) They never see them unless an idiot makes an initial response to them.
3) You shouldn't respond to spam for that reason and others that I can list if 
you really need me to.
4) Having to manually kill branches started by idiots wastes time and will bog 
down the newsreader every time it starts up and has to filter the posts against 
tons of expressions.

Now, what makes more sense:

a) No one responds to cross-posts.
b) Someone responds to them in a weak-ass attempt to be witty, causing the 
thread to appear, forcing manual killing.

I'll help you out, the answer is (a).  You can't argue with logic, unless you 
want to dig a deeper hole ( again ).

No one is holding a gun to your head to be an idiot and condescending asshole, 
yet, you do it almost every time you post.  The worst part is you are of the 
mind that people think you are actually witty when you do this.  Your signal to 
noise ratio is pathetic.

The day XNews will automatically kill let us set up ONE rule to kill branches 
of threads started by certain posters will be a joyous one indeed.  Then I and 
the other XNews converts won't have to see cross-posted threads OR branches of 
threads started by the same 'ol non-contributers.

Since you are so into telling everyone what other peoples' posts "prove", 
here's one for ya: your standard DT reply to this will once again prove that 
you're all noise and no signal.  I'll even let you have your "getting the last 
word" thrill since there's really nothing pertinent to say on the subject.
