2) That mob under the mill in Ill Omen is a Lesser Icebone that apparently
wanders in from ground level somehow.  He can be killed by spells once he
attacks you and is targeted and he can be targeted.  Also he can be drawn
out from under the mill if you lead him outside and pull him from his hiding
place.  The problem is people don't realize this and stand around and try to
fight him and die.  The simplest thing to do is everyone go outside and let
someone pull the mob into the open where he is easily killed.
