Clerics tend to stack their own buffs with this (and then forget that
their precious aego overwrites the hp+ac+*mana* buffs of certain other
classes).
I believe the intent goes like this: potc won't overwrite aego, so a
cleric who has aego+ baotr won't be touched. However, potc is better
than hero+baotr, so if a druid casts potc/g on the cleric, the self
buff won't prevent the cleric from getting the better overall buffage.
