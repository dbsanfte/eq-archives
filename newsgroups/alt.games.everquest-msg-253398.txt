Came up to check my solo spot in the POJ Jail, and there was someone 
working it already.  Wandered off and did my consolation camp, killing 
every Gaoler of Justice in the place; this isn't a bad camp really, they 
seem to drop just as much loot as the P&E mobs, and its dead easy 
because its almost impossible not to get singles (there are a couple 
spots where you can get two at once if you really try, or are really 
unlucky).  Trouble is, it involves spending a lot of time running 
around, not killing, and then there's the slow respawn time; between the 
two problems, I kill about half as many mobs per hour here as I do in 
Jail... except that I tend to get in over my head in Jail so you have to 
take the time running back from POK into account!

Anyway, I did a couple circuits, then checked Jail again.. guy is still 
sitting at the entrance.  Run an eye in, and the jail itself is fully 
popped, he's just doing the entrance.  I ask if I can go in and work the 
death row part, and he says sure, or we can group up.

Well, I warn him I'm expecting a call and will have to leave, but till 
then it will be fine.

In we go, he's got the entrance cleared, so we start on the hall itself.

Two Enforcers, I mez one, the other comes, we kill it, then switch to 
the mezzed mob and wait for mez to break, then kill it.

When there's a Punisher and an Enforcer, I mez the enforcer, we kill the 
punisher, pretty much the same plan as two enforcers.

Sometimes its two Punishers, then we each pull one simultaneously, and 
solo them.

All in all, this was smooth sailing, and we were killing more than twice 
the mobs per hour than either of us would solo, definately a functional 
pairing.

Noticable differences between two 64 mages:

Both of us were using 61 air pet, but I have the aug that gives me 
summoner's boon; my pet tended to get aggro in almost all cases, which 
wasn't a bad thing in general because he also regened his HP literally 
three times as fast.

He had 42 points of AA to my measly 12; this meant he had a little 
critter (like a wizard familiar) which would pop up and apparantly nuke 
for 30 seconds; I didn't see any messages so I can't say for how much. 
He also had the AA where he can send in a flurry of little earth pets, 
again, no idea how effective that was really.  And he had something that 
gave him critical nukes... but they happened fairly rarely.  Hmm, and 2 
points of mental clarity.

Neither of us had anything but self buffs.  I used XPG and EDR for mana 
regen, plus my single point of FT, and a drogmar.  He had three points 
of FT, XPG, and used mod rods fairly regularly... I tend to not use them 
unless mana is visibly a problem.  We seemed to be neck and neck on mana 
use; probably both of us would benefit from using both EDR and Mod Rods, 
instead of just one or the other.

I earned 2000 pp in the time I'd ordinarily have expected to earn 
1000pp, and that with KEI on, so that part was pretty nice.  Funny, 
though, I still hear people saying 3kpp an hour in RM hill giants; I'm 
not convinced I can do that well.

Splendid One, 64 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
