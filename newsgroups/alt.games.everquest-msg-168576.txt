The avatar proc adds 100 ATK (along with other stats that may or may not be
useful).  100 ATK is always useful.  ATK is what is compared with a mob's AC
to see how well you hit it.  If a mob has 1400 AC and all your melee have
1390 ATK, they'll be hitting for crap.  Avatar procs and suddenly they're
doing good damage.

Freakin rangers are pissing me off.  Guild ranger hit 1800 ATK the other
day.  I have to be buffed to the gills to get 1500 ATK, and that's with
ranger buffs.
