Crap, I just realized it's actually a level 12 spell for necros, Sight
Graft, I was thinking of Voice Graft, which is 16 (lets you talk through
your pet)

Need to start working on my level 16 necro's research skill so I can make
Voice Graft, Banshee Aura and Hungry Earth. (fortunately Restless Dead is
vendor sold)
