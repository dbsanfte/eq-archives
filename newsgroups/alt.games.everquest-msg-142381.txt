 Heck with that, do the combine but make avatar a right click from
inventory!

 Sometimes I go a whole fight without a proc. Sometimes I proc on the
first swing. I agree it's something you probably can't say for certain
unless you parse it. And apparently there are people who bothered to do
that to see. I just like the warm fuzzy of maxxing out Dex and thinking
that I'll now proc more often. I think I do, but if I don't? Oh well.
The world isn't going to end because of it.

It's all personal preference really. I personally feel it makes a
difference in my proc rate, so that's good enough for me even if it's
just the placebo effect in action.
