What I find most annoying about EQ is the inability to edit a chat message
or hot key.  It is an all or nothing thing.  Please don't tell me backspace!

Who has not sent a long "tell" to a friend and spellled his name wrong?  Or,
my favorit, brain fart - "/g tell MyFriend yada yada"?

Or you have a hot key set up to say a bunch of text and you need to make a
minor change - zap the whole line and retype.

Now, please don't flame me, I like EQ WAY better than Diablo II, but D2 does
handle the chat window much better.  So, it can be done.

How does somone go about voicing these kinds of issues to the EQ developers?
