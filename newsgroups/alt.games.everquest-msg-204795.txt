    Incorrect. I've been interrupted by a string of missed attacks before,
when I wasn't moving before I started casting. I *think* it's because I was
trying to channel through a beating, and if you try to recast fast enough
you're still in motion. So unless the cleric is missed by all swings and
wasn't hit prior to starting casting, he's going to have to channel. And
even with CA at max, you and I both know the odds of a PoP mob missing on
all swings against an 1100 AC cleric.

    It isn't 10% less damage. It's 10% more misses. Mobs usually hit about
60%+ of the time, so assume 40% misses. So now you have 44% misses, or 56%
hits, a reduction in damage of about 7% rounded up. The more badass the mob
is, the worse the %damage reduction is. That's why elemental players with
all defensive AA's don't notice much of a difference from people without
defensive AA's maxed - they never dodged much to begin with. I've been
trying to up my AC as much as possible, in the hopes that once I get close
to the 2100 AC soft cap I'll actually be dodging enough that it'll make a
difference. WTB Torch of Judgement!
