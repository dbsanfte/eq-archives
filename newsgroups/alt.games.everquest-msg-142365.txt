The quest for the Wizard spell "concussion" involves turn-ins to 3 "a human
skeleton"s.  I believe that at least one of them is KOS to everyone (the one
in CoM), so the normal way is to use the charm trick.  I'm not sure if it is
the only way, though--perhaps some illusions will make you non-KOS?  I've
heard that the elemental illusion from a ball of gollum clay will make you
indifferent to most quest mobs.

Do balls of gollum clay still drop?  I believe they came from something in
the old CT.
