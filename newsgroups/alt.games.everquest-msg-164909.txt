Nah, I have no desire to pay verant to "test" their game for them. I'd
feel like an idiot. For paying to test their game you get:

1) next to no gm service, or I guess actually none at all.
In spite of the jokes you might make, yes that would make it worse
than a regular server.

2) a greatly reduced number of players who will ever come to your
aid for things you can't handle, such as corpse retrievals.

I understand you trying to fix that with the six person group, but it
will be sometime before any of them would have such abilities.

3) the looming possibility of character, or in the only known case
ever it was actually item, deletion.


Of course you also get the advantage of a greatly reduced number of
players in competition for resources.  The bazaar on regular servers 
has sort of solved that problem though, making it so you can buy so
many great things camping is not as important now (except for camping
for money alone, which can be done in quite a few ways)

This is a fun idea though, good luck.
