Well, adding to the previous post. On Lanys I absolutely love taking a full
group with 2 druids or druid/shammy and no cleric.. It works practically
everywhere (maybe except planes). No offence to clerics here, but having
"non-traditional" group makes life much more interesting... Thrilling, since
there's no chance of mistake.. Even though your role is mcuh more than just
healer.  And speaking of LDON (if you do it) -- that's when 2 dru or dru/shm
combo really shines.. And if you're afraid of spending money on rezzes in
case shit hits the fan -- grab a pally as MT -- 90% will do for most.
But that's a 2 cents of a person who's not a druid, just likes to play with
them.

Woland,
Enchanter of Lanys T'Vil
