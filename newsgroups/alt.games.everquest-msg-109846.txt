I can remember dropping to server select on zoning into BB or EFP on the
boat, and by the time I got back in I was headed back to where I came from.
Lots of laughs.  Or the time I waited 20 minutes for the BB shuttles to
leave, only to have them do an about-face before reaching the large ship in
TD.  That's a thrill a minute.  I remember zoning on the boat and ending up
on top of the crow's nest pole, and falling to my death.  What adventure!  I
remember zoning on a boat and when I came through on the other side, I was
standing on chessboard island, completely lost, at about level 12.   I hate
the f'ing boats.
