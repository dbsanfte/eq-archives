What kind of experienced players require 24x7 service... why not just have
5gm's grouped with you. In addition, perhaps they can make an individual
epic for each character that subscribes.  I'd could have "Probis' phat lewt
flewt of d00m"  That would be great for my bard....  :)

I don't know, while I'm sure this service will appeal to a few elitists, I
will likely stick with the pleeb service and get shit on for 10 bucks a
month <g>
