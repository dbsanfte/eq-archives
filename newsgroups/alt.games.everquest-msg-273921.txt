No you are not alone in that one. If I want to group I will let you
know, thankyouverymuch :)  But really, sometimes even if I don't say I
am looking or have LFG up it would be nice to get a, "Hello I am so
and so and me and this guy are going off to kill those big rats over
there, want to join us?" I have actually grouped with folks when I was
off to do stuff alone because they were so polite, how could I say no?
Of course,  almost annoying as spam invites, are the "grp plz"  I say
almost because despite being annoying these folks actually make an
attempt to ask before spamming me.
