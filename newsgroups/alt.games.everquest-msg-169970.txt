Well you bought the worst horse.

From Caster's Realm:

Horses:

Horses are a new element in the game of Everquest. Horses came out at the
time Luclin was released and offer a new twist for players. Below, I have
outlined most of what you need to know about horses based upon personal experience.

Horses are generally purchased from The Bazaar in Luclin. Since the Bridles
are No-Drop you must own Luclin in order to purchase a horse.

Speed and Prices

Type                        Speed                      Price Range
Rope Bridle Approx.         25% Movement Rate Increase 8,400pp to 12,300pp
Leather Bridle  Approx.     50% Movement Rate Increase 27,300pp to 41,000pp
Silken Bridle Approx.       60% Movement Rate Increase 60,900pp to 84,800pp
Chain Bridle  Approx.       70% Movement Rate Increase 95,600pp to 135,400pp
Ornate Chain Bridle Approx. 85% Movement Rate Increase Only drop off very
high level NPC's in Luclin.

A note on prices, the most expensive price represents a 40 charisma while
the lowest price represents a 110 charisma. 110 charisma is the best you
can have for the horse merchants, anything higher doesn't lower the
prices further. You can see how getting a high level charisma buff would
be good when buying a horse though.

Color

Colors don't seem to matter much other than for show.  Black and White
horses are the more popular colors over Brown and Tan, so they are
the more expensive in each category. Basically, Black and White horses
are mostly a larger status symbol saying 'see, I can afford the prettier
horse!' In reality, a Tan Silken Bridle runs as fast as someone else's
White Silken Bridle.

SoW is 34-55% speed increase depending on the level of the
caster(9-50). Run speed 1,2,3 are 10%,20%,30%, and Jboots/Tboots
are 35%.
(for reference spirit of cheetah is 115% and bards
can move at 20-135% depending on level and instruments)
Paladin's and Shadow Knights AA war steeds are equivalent to
the top Ornate chain horses and are instant cast.
You do not gain mana at the sit rate while moving but
you do while just standing still.

Basically the 1st 2 'levels' of horses are not worth it
as they are slower than most Sow and are slow to start
and stop. So the minimum pp you are looking at to get a
'decent' horse is 60,900pp.

A horse would be handy to have but Its one of those if
you got money to burn and no other upgrades to buy things.


Advantages:

-Sitting on horseback allows casters/hybrids to meditate without incurring the
agro you gain from sitting down. You can run from outdoor fights a lot easier.

-Faster horses naturally mean its easier to flee from fights.

-You move at the same speed on horseback regardless of how
encumbered you become.

-Horses can be used at level 1.

-When riding a horse you get an innate Safefall skill of 150.

Disadvantages:

-Meleeing is a lot harder on horseback than not on horseback. Frequently,
you get the message 'your target is too far away' or 'you can't see your target'.

-Looting from horseback can also be problematic as you click on your mount
instead of the corpse.

-Currently if you cast the wrong spell during a fight, you can't interrupt it by ducking.

-Most, if not all illusions, don't stack while you're on horseback.

-For kiting classes, kiting is not very easy as horses require a 1 to 4 seconds to get
going and 1 to 4 seconds to fully stop for spell casting purposes.

-Horses are expensive to obtain and also No-Drop. This means you can't sell it to other
players later, though there is an NPC in The Bazaar that allows you to sell your horse
for roughly 60% of what you paid for it should you want a better horse later.

-Horses require food and water from your rations to upkeep.

-Horses have a casting time to summon. Unlike Journeyman Boots you cannot simply click
them and be instantly on a horse. The only exception to this is the Paladin and
hadowknight horses obtained via alternate advancement which are instant use.

-Another snag with horses... they drown! When you enter water deep enough to
start swimming, your horse gets unsummoned.

-Beggars who see you on horseback assume you can give them high-level gear and that you're
rich.


Summary

Overall, horses are the most beneficial to casting classes, both wisdom and
intelligence casters. In high-end raids where a lot of casters need to med
during fights, it's beneficial as you don't gain the agro from sitting down
while not on horseback. However, interrupting spells you mistakenly cast
or don't want to cast can be annoying, especially if you're a cleric casting Complete
Heal.

For Melee classes, horses are pretty much a very expensive luxury aimed
at getting you from point A to point B. Meleeing on horseback is especially
difficult because the mobs tend to be too far away or you can't see them,
even though they can still pound on you.

For Hybrids, horses tend to be in the same boat as melee classes, though
if they are fixed so that you can melee well on horseback, it might be a little
more useful in gaining mana back faster. Still, Paladins and Shadow Knights
get a special AA skill that summons a horse for them that is as good as the
Ornate Chain Bridle horses, so patience might be better than putting out a
minimum of 8,400pp for a horse. Out of all the hybrids, Beastlords would
gain the most benefit as they tend to be the most mana-dependant hybrid
class out of all the hybrid classes.

Lastly, Bards are the least likely to ever need a horse. They have
Selo's and horses are kiting-unfriendly, so Bards would be better off
with their Selo's over a horse in my opinion.
