If your resolution is at 800x600 like mine, try:
/hitsmode other m3 0 320 7
which will neatly place others' hits over on the left side of your
screen between your spell gems and your hotkeys.

Note that there is no confirmation message and no new (visible) window
is created, so you won't actually see a discernible result until you
get into combat.  However, it's saved to your eqclient.ini, so you
only have to type it in once.  For other screen resolutions,
increase/decrease the 320.

There are some annoying limitations which I haven't figured out a way
around yet (for example, others' MISSES will stil go to your chat
box), but overall it's quite a nice addition.
