Is there a way to search that site without having to become a premium
member?  All I can seem to do is list quests by zone, faction or
item.....still feel confused as there are so many and my knowledge of EQ is
exteremley limited.

If you could point out one or two in the Fawyder region I would be very
greatful, I will continue to look through these lists to see if I can find
some myself also, I really do try and search most the information myself,
and will generally only post when I need something specific, thanks for any
help you can give.
