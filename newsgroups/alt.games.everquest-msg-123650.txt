My pet theory on this (that I havent bothered testing but just thats
been brewing around) is that these cancl magics take the spells with
the lowest counters first - i.e. bye bye to your half worn buffs and
low levels. It doesnt *seem* random to me. There does appear to be
some kind of method to it - I'll test it when I get home toniht if
I can be bothered ;)
