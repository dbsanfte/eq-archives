I've recently started playing on a Team Pvp server, and after killing a
particularly obnoxious gnome (PC), I got the above message. What effect will
this have? Is it lowering my faction with NPCs or will Gnome PCs get some
message like "He's a nasty Gnome murderer" if they con me or something like
that? Or is it just some kind of hack or just a message for the sake of it?

Cheers
    Ben
