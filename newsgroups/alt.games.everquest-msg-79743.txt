My level 6 Druid cast Flame (or something) from the top of the pit outside
Blackburrow on a Gnoll wandering the ledge below.

Next thing I know about 15 players come charging out of the door followed by
30 or so Gnolls.

I was new, didn't know anything about aggro or pathing. Luckily there were
no witnesses...
