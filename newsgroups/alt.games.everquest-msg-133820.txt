My experience has been exactly the opposite. And, it boils down to the
last paragraph: Somebody *always* screws up and either trains the camp
or leaves a corpse in the Maestro room or some similar misadventure.

Our most textbook raids have been Hate raids that stayed in the port
up room until the first floor was mostly clear and we moved to the
Maestro room. The raids that have made me want to never raid again
have more often than not been Hate raids where we tried to break for
the wall. Of course, those were also "open raids" and at least one of
them had in excess of 70 people, but it was still the lengthy,
disasterous break-in that really stuck with me (followed by the
lengthy, disasterous CR.)

Besides avoiding running an entire raid through a fully popped zone,
getting GFluxed at the break-in room doesn't require a camp out, since
you're not getting HTed by MObs upstairs.
