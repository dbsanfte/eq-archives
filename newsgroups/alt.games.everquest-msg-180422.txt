The ones that he is pitching are MMORPGs that are set in timelines from the
recent past to the near future ... or uses an alternative timeline premise
(such as one where magic does exist, WWIII did occur, etc.).  I probably
shouldn't go too far in explaining his MMORPGs, but what he says is the
method he and those others who are pitching this free breed of MMORPGs is
simply letting advertising exist in these MMORPGs as they currently exist
today.  In other words, there will be billboards, posters pasted to walls,
TV ads on the TV sets, radio ads on the radio channels, etc.  Also, for your
food and drink, they'd be brand products.  Clothes would be designer labels.
You wouldn't be able to buy a generic car, but one made by Toyota, Ford, or
Volvo.  Personally, I look forward to this sort of realism.  It will
naturally be a balancing act, but I think it is quite doable.
