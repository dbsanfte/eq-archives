Well, personally, as a guilded druid, I am finally breathing a sigh of
relief.  Now, I have much more time to do what *I* want to do (which
includes logging onto my mage to get him up there in levels to).  Now,
people are capable of travelling to where they want to go, without my
assistance.  And the request for ports from outside the guild have
dramatically dropped.  And, for once in a long time, I'm able to travel
around without /role on, and not be bombarded with "port plz"... :)

Personally, I only *rarely* port-whored myself, and that was shortly after
getting many of my port spells... :)
