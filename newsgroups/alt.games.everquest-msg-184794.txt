    How much did they get back when you were getting stuff? Were they
getting nothing back then, and you were getting the nice items like Shield
of Ssra?

    *cough* 50 HPs *cough* Is it a bit better now? ;-)

    It's about reputation and honour. Those folks refuse to be "screwed

    And be sure to include that when you do a comparison with others. That

    It's common sense. If there's a really glaring hole in someone's gear,

cloak of yours? The last person to win one in my guild replaced a Mammoth
Hide Cloak with that. Quite the change, that!
