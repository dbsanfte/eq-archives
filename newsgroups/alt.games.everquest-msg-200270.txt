heh, that's what I recall as well.  Still no clue whether it was the 
game or the card that was happier with the faster processor, I just know 
it was happier.

Oh and while I'm in this thread I should probably weigh in with my 
opinion of PS.

It was moderately unstable over the weekend, but that's to be expected 
since no one releases finished games any more and this was the first 
weekend after release.  They are working on stability and I'm guessing 
they'll either solve the issues or lose enough customers that the 
servers will be empty and stable soon enough.

The grief system is a good idea but needs some work.  Some warning that 
you are being penalized, so that you can tell its not a game bug that 
won't let you reload or drive or whatever would be good, especially till 
they get rid of more of the actual bugs hehe.  Was hard to tell which 
was which, in fact I still don't know.  They also need to remove grief 
points for being run over hehe.  I have no idea how that is still in the 
code at release.  Sure it was easy to say that if you damaged a teammate 
you earned GP, but it doesn't make much sense to be penalized for being 
killed by an idiot driver and denting his bumper as he ran you over.

Game play beyond those issues is much better post release now that there 
are even more people playing.  I was in some huge battles lasting for an 
hour or more and while there is no sense of accomplishment other than 
blowing people up, I found blowing people up fun enough that I spent the 
entire weekend, other than bar time and a little sleep, doing just that.
