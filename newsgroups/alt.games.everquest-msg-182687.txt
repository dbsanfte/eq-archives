I definitely feel I'm getting my money's worth with Allakhazam's, but 
unfortunately they just don't seem to be keeping up with the game, 
especially when it comes to non-equipment drops and quests. Then again, 
it *is* a repository for player-garnered information, and as such only 
as good as the people who contribute to it.

I'm not sure about Magelo, though... Does it provide any actual info, or 
is it just a mechanism for automated dick-waving?
