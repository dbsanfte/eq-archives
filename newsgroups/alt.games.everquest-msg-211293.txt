The low level harmony is AoE, so, if the mobs are close together, you can 
harmony more than one at once, and you will see which ones were hit, as 
they will have the spell effects around them when it hits.  That being 
said, you will need to learn to individually harmony each mob eventually 
anyway, as the high level harmony is a single target spell, and event the 
low level one is a very small area of effect, so the mobe would have to be 
very close together to be hit by it.
