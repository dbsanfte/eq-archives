can they do it?  definitely.  Do they plan to?  definitely not.  will they
probably end up doing something along these lines?  probably.

effectively horses are the property of EQ currently.  they allow you to run
faster / tradable / and cost a heck of a lot for the higher end ones, so are
also a status symbol.

They also had 16 slot backpacks in beta-testing, but decided to limit any
container to only 10 slots.

They also had plans for allowing you to rent a room with a specific key to
get into that room that you payed for, but those plans fell by the wayside
although I believe  they still have the rooms and keys.

guild halls / houses would be kewl, if they were only located in cities.
add on zones that only were for housing would be also kewl.  You definitely
don't wanna deal with stupid problems like in UO.

also if you can imagine a huge player force of the richest players who
really wanted housing in effect, would be a major impetus to having
effectively new grahpics / custom builds to put their dreams into reality in
EQ.  Housing would mostly be customizing a new building type, I don't forsee
it allowing you to store stuff in chests like in UO or locked down items.
Most players at this point aren't that visionary / haven't pushed to right
buttons at Verant.

I think if all the players were adamant about this being in the game ( no
extra space storage, just new buildings for guilds), I cannot see why Verant
wouldn't decide it was a bad thing over a good thing.

For any major changes, you can understand them wanting to be paid extra for
the extra work.  thus  they package and resell it as an add-on.  From a
business stand point it makes sense.  I'm sure it also makes it harder from
an upkeep stand-point, as you could conceivably have certain upgrades and
not others, thus complicating things.
complication is preferable I guess to the extra bonuses the new add-ons
provide.  Housing would be such a huge improvement, I cannot see why they
wouldn't make it an add-on.

Finally, I think the dev team seems pretty busy with fixing the VENDORS to
worry about extra things.  let them get this needed fix done first.  : 0
