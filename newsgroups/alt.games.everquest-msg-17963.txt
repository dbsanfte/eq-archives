Might be fun to you, not to me :) Even with double the spellslots you still
can't have all you want memmed.

: I would like to see the pet as a member of my "group".

That's an idea, too .. even maybe more logical.

: Gameplay. There has to be a downside...

Oh you mean like dieing within seconds when you get hit, or taunting
mobs madly with spells. Or was it not getting any combat skills?
Ah no .. we all have that. Yeah .. we really need this 'blind'
sillyness. It truly balances us out :)

Ok sarcasm off .. I think it's pure crap and does not have to do anything
with gameplay. This is totally only my opinion, though.
