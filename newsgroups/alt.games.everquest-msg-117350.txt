That's good, I probably will give it a try then.  I like roleplaying
(espesially nasty trolls!) so I think FV would be a nice new home for my EQ
time.

Heheh, well the idea here was the fun it'd be to know all the EC traders
would have to watch, screaming in a fit of reality shock as they realized
that that gear was about to disappear forever.  Unfortunately I don't
suppose any one but me would know, so no point I know.  I do have one real
life accquaintence who is in a SuperGuild and a serious gamer, and she about
crapped her pants when I told her what I wanted to do.  Good for a giggle
that was!  ;)
