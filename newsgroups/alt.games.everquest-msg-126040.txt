Uhmmm...

AC in SRo is NOT a random spawn... that's the whole point of killing
everything to GET him to pop... so you CAN reply to a camp check with
"AC"... and as he's pretty much the only thing in SRo worth camping (unless
you're a masochistic Erud tailor) people *should* respect your camp.

Of course, the world is full of arseholes who can't wrap their brains around
the idea that 'MM'orpg means there are other people who might not agree with
you :o)
