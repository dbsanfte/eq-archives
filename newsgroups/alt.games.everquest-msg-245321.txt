Yes, the pullers I know seem to prefer Ruj also. MMC doesn't seem too
bad either. I've had good luck in Guk hards (won first six I think
before failing one) but a lot of people really don't like Guk hard.
I don't think I've ever tried a Mir hard. 

The really nasty one in my experience is Tak. My record is pretty
dismal there. Had one recently where the bard died four times trying
to pull a room with eight mobs, before we gave up and headed out. 
Felt bad for the guy because he claimed to have never failed a
Tak mission before then.
