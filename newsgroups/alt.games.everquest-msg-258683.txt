Especially for wind, there aren't many songs that can improve from
better instrument modifiers anyway. You don't get more invisible with a
better flute, or charm longer or mez longer and that's about the extent
of wind songs. About the only modifier most bards in our guild care
about is drums, for resist songs and running real fast.
