Uh, you may want to look again.   The enchanter snake staff casts "Speed of
the Shissar".   The fastest pure haste spell currently in the game, mana free.
(Although I've heard some say the level 60 enchanter spell Visions of Grandeur
may be "better",(adds attack or stats or something) SotS will still get pretty
much every melee to thier haste cap, if they have a haste item too.)
