No, actually, this is where you should note that ATI has *not* updated their
drivers since then, and Nvidia has several times for some *noticeable*
performance improvements on even older cards.

I have a 9700 pro that I put into a secondary machine because my G3-ti500
equaled or exceeded its performance in most everything, including EQ.  I did
notice that the 9700 pro handled particle effects better, but I play with
those off most of the time for reasons other than performance anyway.
