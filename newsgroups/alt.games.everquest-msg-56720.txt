LOL you post to complain out complainers.

I notice that you like to respond to comments, usually to put across your
arrogant opinion, cos you think that no-one else has a right to their
opinion. Why do you feel the need to tell someone that they have no right to
feel unhappy about EQ's customer service, why do you even care. How about
starting a thread and presenting a fresh subject instead of flaming people.
Does it make you feel somehow big and bad.

Oh btw. just try and flame me, your not very good at it, but you can try.
I could use a could laugh while the dicks at EQ sort out the crap they've
made of the game.
