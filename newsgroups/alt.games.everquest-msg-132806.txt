I'm not the one who brings complete strangers into my house and bed them down
with my wife and watch them go at it, all the while the kids are sleeping (at
least you think they are). I'm not the one who post his wife's picture half
clothed on the internet advertising for partners for her. I'm not the one here
who has done all of those things.

Do you seriously believe a child over 10 years old doesn't have a very good
idea what their mom and dad are doing in the bedroom with these strangers. A
child ten and older have a hell of lot more recognition and understanding of
things than you would like to believe.  I think the average person would think
you are the most depraved person in this group.
