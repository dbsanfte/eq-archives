Wizard PB AOE spells are faster casting/lower recast than Druid or Cleric PB
AOE.  From a brief look at some of them at Caster's Realm, it also looks
like they are better mana efficiency.  I'll talk more about this below.

Wizards have fire, cold, and magic based spells, so if you are fighting mobs
that resist a particular kind, Wizards will have something else to use.

Finally, I believe Wizard nukes have a better chance of landing than those
of other classes.  (It's kind of the nuking equivalent of the Cleric healing
bonus).

Oh, Wizards are also way more likely to be specialized in Evocation, which
will help some.

If you can get a regular group together to do this, why not try learning in
a safer area?  Go to a lower level dungeon, mem lower level AOE spells, and
practice on greens.  Sure, you don't get XP, but you also don't die (as
much).  Get comfortable with AOE'ing 20 greens, then move on to the real
mobs.

Earthquake: 246 damage/mob for 375 mana.

Upheaval: 718 damage/mob for 675 mana.

Unspoken Word: 605 damage/mob for 427 mana.

Suppose the mobs have 6000 hitpoints.  That takes 9 casts of Upheaval.  That
is 6075 mana.  I think Druid AOE is similar.  6075 mana is more than 2
Clerics of Druids have, so you'll need three nukers, maybe four.  With
Wizards, you could do it in two.
