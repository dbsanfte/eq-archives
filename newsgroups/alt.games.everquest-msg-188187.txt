I woke up this morning and was fearful because we were going to war, and I
realized that I had been a proponent of this course of action, and began to
question the validity of this. I tried to ask God over and over if what we
were doing was right, and he told me over and over that I had done what he
wanted and shouldn't worry about it.

My belief system tells me that because I have acted according to God's
design that I and the US will be blessed accordingly, I feel that President
Bush must have the same things going on in his mind and that God must have
commanded him to go to war.

It seems that people don't really understand God and don't understand that
war is a part of life and think that humanity has evolved to the point where
problems can be solved by diplomacy, but only the diplomacy of devils can
achieve fruition.
