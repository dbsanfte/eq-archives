Did they all head past the Paineel newbie-area guards at low levels?
I went past them without incident even at scowling, but that's
because I first went there at high levels (and since the guards
in question are around level 10-12, it wouldn't take very many
levels to get to the point where they leave you alone because
they're too green).

There's clearly some explanation for the differences between
your experiences and John's, and my question was an honest
attempt to try to figure out what the cause might be -- which
is why the tone of your response was surprising.
