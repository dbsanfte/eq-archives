I've had a number of LD deaths too, including one fun one where I went LD
while running across OT.  I logged back in to fall for 10000 points of
damage in the pit in OT.  I was in my low 30s at the time.  Fortunately, I
have friends online that helped get my corpse out, and rezzed me.  It
happens some times.  Life goes on.  It's a game.
