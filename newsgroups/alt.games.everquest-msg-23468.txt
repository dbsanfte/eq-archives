Right now, the Good and Neutral teams are actually doing quite well, as at
least half the Evil team seems to be playing Sullon as if it were a non-PvP
server.

The trouble will happen IN THE FUTURE for Team Good _if_ and _when_ the new
rule about lowbies being able to be PK'd in travel zones and mid-to-high
level adventure zones takes effect.

Verant says that next patch, a new rule will take effect.  Those under level
6 *Will Be Able To Be PK'd* in mid-to-high level adventure zones.  (I repeat
that, because you seem to have missed that major point in my first post, Mr.
Vazquez.)

That includes most travel zones between Qeynos and Freeport.  It includes
the zone between Erudin and Qeynos.  It includes the zone between Freeport
and Butcherblock.  It will be little or no problem for the Neutrals and
Evils.  It could become a major problem for the Goods.

Did you not understand that point, sir?  It is the new rule, once it is in
effect, that will hurt the Good team far worse than the other teams.

Lowbie Goods from Freeport will have an extremely difficult time migrating
to the GFay or EF.  Lowbie runners won't be able to gather supplies for Team
Good's Enchanters or smiths in Halas.  Why?  Because the Neuts will gank
them once they step foot in Erud's Crossing or the Karana Plains.

Everfrost may be rich in leveling possibilities and lowbie loot, but it is
poor in magical armor, magical weapons, caster supplies, many trade skills
and quest items...especially for non-Barbarians.

I see many positive things happening with the Good Team, and I'm
increasingly convinced that they will thrive on Sullon.  The way that Team
Good has been forced to fight for their very survival on Antonica, I think
makes them better long-term tactical planners and fighters than the other
teams, and I think this will enable them to eventually expand their
territory.

The problem is, in the meantime, this new PK'ing of lowbies in travel zones
will unfairly penalize the Good Team, while not affecting the Evil or
Neutral teams at all.

I'm convinced Team Good will find a way to overcome this extra penalty
against them.  I'm just saying, that if Verant insists on penalizing the
underdog team further, that maybe they should do something to take the sting
out of this new disadvantage, once it's implemented.
