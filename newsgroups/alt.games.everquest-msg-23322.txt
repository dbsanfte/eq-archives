There's no hard and fast rule on where it works and where it doesn't.
Nor is there any rules on what it works against and what it doesn't.

For example, MOST dragons see through hide/sneak.  Sontalak which sees
right through invis, doesn't see through sneak (weird having him con
indifferent).  Whereas, our rogues spend a lot of time naked when
trying to hide/sneak past the VP dragons.

Yes, you can hide/sneak your way through CS and even WW if you're
careful.  I wouldn't recommend trying it in ToV however...unless
you're very ballsy and have a necro on standby to summon your corpse.
