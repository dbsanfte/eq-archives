SKs are comparable to Paladins for HPs and damage mitigation, and bring 
solid easy agro control, just like a paladin.  If I have a choice, I'll 
take a knight class over a warrior, but, I won't wait on one.  Again, a 
warrior with good hate generating weapons works well too.  Having been 
the main healer in groups with various tank types as the main tank, I 
have seen no appreciable difference as far as healing between the 
different tanks, except that Paladins bring their own heals to the table 
to help.  Of course, I don't have a CHeal that takes advantage of huge hp 
totals either.
