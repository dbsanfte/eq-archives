HAHA! Why not a huge Spectre! Imagine looking out an office window and
seeing that coming toward your building. I like the snarling sounds
they make when they attack and when they fly up it sounds like wind
blowing through a graveyard.

On the other hand a dry bones skeleton would be cool. "You know, I
really hate corporate executives like you!" A dry bones skeleton
begins to cast a spell. YOU have taken 78 points damage. You have been
slain by a dry bones skeleton.
