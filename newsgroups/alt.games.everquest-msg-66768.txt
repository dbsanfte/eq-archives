Well, your right your system has a CPU bottleneck.  you could drop a
geforce 3 TI in there and its not going to get much better.  and the
voodoo2 isnt even mentionable as a competitive card.  

now before the recent upgrade if you were running a 2 year old voodoo
3000 that would have out performed your tnt2 m64 card.

the reason the m64 version of the tnt2 is crap, is because they
crippled its memory bandwidth.  if you can find a 2 year old tnt2
ultra its better and faster.  if you can put in a 50 geforce2 mx200
its better and faster and thats the crippled mx.  basically the tnt2
m64 is only good today for people who will not be playing games.  

it should be a 10$ card today, and staples charges 60$ or so for the
one they sell.  

but then were talking PCI video cards here so choices can be limited.
but the geforce or radeon cards are availalbe for under 100 bucks and
can actually play the games.
