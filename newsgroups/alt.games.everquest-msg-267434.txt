Actually, that has always been the case.  Tolerance of OT (hey, I'm a known
OT offender) does not make it suddenly on-topic.

Yeah, because when you bought the Kunark expansion to Everquest, the game
suddenly changed its name to Kunarkquest.

What's that?  It didn't?  It kept the name "Everquest"?  Neat...

I have no problems with this group expanding to encompass EQ2, and I'm
not at all convinced that a new group should be made for EQ2.  Odd that I
would say that after my above comments isn't it?  =)
