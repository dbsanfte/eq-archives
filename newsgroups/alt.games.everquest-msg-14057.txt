I admit to feeling guilty as I leveled through 30 with little risk in
ButcherBlock

The 4 spawns were cake walk with our group.  They are even spaced far enough
apart that an unbroken camp can be single pulled!  After an hour, I had the
spawns down so good that I was calling them within 5-10 seconds of popping.
With a couple wizzies, the mobs life expectency was measured at 10-15
seconds.  We were able to have 2-3 members go akf or go sell whenever
without stopping the slaughter.  One long sunday (with a mostly full group
even) and my first hell level was gone.  I was 140pp richer with the plat,
FS and ringmail drops too.
