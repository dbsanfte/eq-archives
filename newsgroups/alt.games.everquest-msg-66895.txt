what kind of pl'n? if you are just having a high lvl cleric/druid heal
and/or dmg shield you, its kind of not really pl'n.  bards cant tank and
they dont dish out crap for dmg, so killing is relatively slow and you will
eat away at the healers mana.  the best way i've found to pl into the 50s is
to go to a good exp zone with bonus exp and just hide in a corner while your
lvl 60 friends beat the crap out of things.  i did this with my monk in
chardok. i fd'd him in the corner and played my cleric in a group full of
epic rogues, warriors and sk's.  sure the higher lvl ppl suck up most the
experience, but exp in chardok is awesome and deep down, the mobs are all
55+.  lots of undead and some see thru invis, so sneaking your bard down
there will be a challenge.
