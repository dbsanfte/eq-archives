Which "higher levels" are you talking about?  Which zones?  Or are you
talking about epic battles or extremely high level raids?

In Chardok (just xp camping, which is what people do 90+% of the time), at
the exit, critters can hit for almost 500 per round, and though my 43 cleric
friend does get a decent number of resists (hey, he's too low for the zone),
my 57 cleric has no problem.  Level 5 stun costs 35 mana and lasts for about
a tick (6 seconds).  A Superior Heal (583hp) costs 250.  Do the math.
