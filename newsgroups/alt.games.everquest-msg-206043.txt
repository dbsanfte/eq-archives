Warrior gains/loses ((STA/10) * Level) HP for STA changes.  So at 40
(gratz, btw) each point of STA gain/loss should net you +/- 4 HP. I
think this can be affected by at least one PoP AA, at least Dearic
posted something to that effect a while back.  But you don't have to
worry about that for a while yet.
