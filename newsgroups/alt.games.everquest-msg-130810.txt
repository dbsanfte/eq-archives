I've used several boats without problems.  Jump in, right click once, 
and you'll see "you have the helm" or something like that.  Then when 
you turn, the boat will turn with you.  It's a damn slow way to move, 
though.  I'd only use a boat if there were something in the water 
particularly unpleasant (ie, in oasis, where I've heard there are some 
rather nasty aqua goblins - but then, if you're using the boat, you're 
going to see the specs, and if you're going to see the specs, you're 
either suicidal or high enough to smack around some aqua goblins 
anyway...).  Otherwise, just swim there.  Even if your swimming skill is 
still fairly pathetic, you're going to go faster than the rowboats.

And speaking of the boats, has anyone else had the problem of a jerky 
screen view once they start trying to turn the boat?  I clambered into a 
boat for a higher view to see if I could spot a friend the other day, 
and as soon as I turned it just a little bit, it started flickering back 
and forth.  It made my eyes hurt very quickly.
