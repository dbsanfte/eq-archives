Heh, when I got tremor at 24, I went to Kurns Tower and bitch slapped the

Upheaval is the last Druid PBAOE at 51, 52 for Clerics, doing a max of 718
per target, however, Clerics do get The Unspoken Word at 59 which is less
damage (605 max) but has a stun and blind component on it.

And yes, Upheaval does do more damage than the last single target cleric DD
spell, Reckoning, which tops out at 670 max.  However, Clerics do get Exile
Undead, which does 725 dmg max to undead only.

The Cleric specific line of PBAOEs tends to be more mana-efficient though
than the Earthquake line they share with the Druid. (the Word line)
