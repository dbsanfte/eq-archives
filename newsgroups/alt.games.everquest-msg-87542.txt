The Magelo profiles people have made to show their gear never look
right on my screen anyway, so I don't feel any particular desire to
make one for myself.

I do that manually. It's easier when I don't worry too much about what
my alts are wearing, of course.

Geo and Tripod block remote linkage of pictures, i.e. linking to html
pages on other sites. You can see them the first time because you've
presumably looked at them once before linking and they're in your
internet cache.
