 That would be interesting since Neriak is the only place you can buy
coffins (excluding PoA). How would Iksar Nec/SKs get them? I never took
my Iksar to Neriak but I would think they would at least start
apprehensive there. 

 Can any Sk/Nec Iksar out there confirm? Of course, by the time you can
summon corpses you'll have Gather Shadows and can invis to the merchant,
but still.
