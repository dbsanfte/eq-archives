I found the same thing with the ranger quest. I found it hard to find the bronze
to even get the first few pieces. I'm doing better with my dwarf though. I found
a bunch of bronze in the Plane of Knowledge on one the merchants. Ironbane has
now got three armour pieces, but still has a lot to collect. Some of which I can
see will be difficult.

If you can spare a few points into tailoring you can quite easily make up
patchwork armour from ruined wolf pelts. Buy a small sewing kit, and buy a
pattern and ruined wolf pelts from a vendor and sew away. I was able to raise my
tailoring skill quite a bit doing this and made a few pieces of armor. If you
want to persist with tailoring you can make even better armour.

As for cash, try getting to the butcher blocks. I found that pristine skunk
claws are very nice. I'm getting 3pp each. And there are some other items there
that I'm getting a bit for. Goblin heads, and vials of their blood give you
around 3pp too.

I've been playing for about two weeks, and I think I'm finally getting the hang
of it. I've researched a lot of web sites and lurked forums like this one.
(there seems to be a low signal to noise ratio on most of them though). Sites
I've found useful are www.everlore.com  , www.eqtraders.com and, www.eqatlas.com

Cheers
