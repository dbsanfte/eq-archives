A.g.e. has always been about all things Everquest. Everquest 2 certainly 
falls into that category. It is appropriate in name, lore and largely in 
player community.

Personally, I don't care which way it ends up, though I do have a slight 
preference for them to be combined here just to keep me from having to keep 
up with yet another group.

To say one has nothing to do with the other is just incorrect and, IMO, 
self-serving. Precedence has been established all over Usenet. Game sequels 
very often share the same group as the original. As a matter of fact, I 
spot checked a couple of titles the other day and didn't find any that 
segregate the title into seperate groups for each version. Granted, I only 
checked a couple, but I'd be interested to hear of any that did break up 
the community as suggested here.

Let's not confuse what you prefer or find convenient with what makes sense.
