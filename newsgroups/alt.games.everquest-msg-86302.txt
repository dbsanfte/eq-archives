I can only get 3 in my twists as well.  I have an excellent ping
most of the time but can't quite get in that 4th song without a
brief drop.  Had one guy tell me in game he could keep 5 mobs mezzed
with his bard.  I have been able to do 4 (my fingers were smokin')
but not 5.  I had the chance to try 5 in KC but 1 would get lose and
once he stunned me it was big trouble time  =).
