I don't really think they would be happy to call it a nerf at all. As 
you said, it only works out as a nerf at the particular intersection of 
POP + Soloing, and generally I don't use the word "nerf" much because 
it's whiny, overused and, in most cases, unjustified. 

In this particular occasion, since it affected mostly at *my* playstyle 
in *my* favourite zones, I wasn't quite as picky in my choice of words. 
Just chalk it up to me being a hypocrite. :)
