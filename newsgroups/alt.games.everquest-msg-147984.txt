No, ratio is ALL off hand, no reason to further cut your DPS with
inferior weapons, none at all.

No, this is wrong.

This is wrong, fastest possible weapon only works for combat skill
raises main hand.

The +2 Dex will make no difference at all unless you parse to 5
decimal places or something.  The Beak is utter utter crud and needs
to go.

He should put the Fungusbeast Spine main hand because you get more
skill increases that way while doing passable DPS meantime, it is BY
FAR the best weapon he has.  The Centi LS isn't even close.
