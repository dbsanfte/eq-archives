<<<<Y'know, I had a rather verbose response all typed up, then it hit me ....
you're just spoiling for a fight because someone else stole your crutch.
And there's not a thing in this whole wide world you can do about it.

You snipped the part where it was mentioned that, if your characters are 43,
you'll be unaffected by this anyway.

So what other reason is there for your response than to simply invoke an
arguement?

I tried to show you the other side of the coin.  You started throwing
insults.  If you want a fight, you'll not get one from me.  There's nothing
to fight about.

SOE made the change, not me.  I suggest you decide if you're going to deal
with it or leave.

Crash>>>>>

I'm not looking for a fight and you're only quitting because you know you
haven't got a leg to stand on.  Your point about the guy being five levels too
low to be where you are and then bitching at you was completely debunked.  You
can easily avoid all that trouble but you either like it and like whining about
it, or, you just like seeing other people have less fun which is equally
infantile.  All I want to do is have more fun playing a game I really like.  I
don't care if they make mobs tougher or raise how much exp it takes to level or
just about anything.  All I want to do is not sit on my butt doing nothing. 
It's still a game and I'll play it as long as it is fun.  Sitting on my butt
waiting for mana to come back has never been and will never be, fun.   How can
it be fun to you?
