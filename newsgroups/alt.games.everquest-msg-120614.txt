No, it's only taking advantage of the seller if the seller has no idea of
the "worth" of the product. *You* apparently know the "worth" of a port.
*You* apparently have a backbone. Use it!

Besides, if it's only worth 2pp to me, right now, to get a port from LOIO
to Surefall Glade, then why should I offer more? Out of pity for your risk
free, effort free "MAKE MONEY FAST" habit?  Any insult you feel from being
offered less than your "deserved" princely sums is purely in your own head.

It's not like the port spell didn't pay for itself the first day you got
it...

Or posting prices up front will become the norm. Or if Verant hears enough
bitching about ports, they might add more firepot rooms. It's not like the
laws of physics allow only one possible result.

FWIW, I see anywhere from 10pp to 50pp as not common knowledge prices but
common *advertised* prices.
