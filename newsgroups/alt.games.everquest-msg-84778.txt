    For some reason I lose every roll on CC Gaunts, and win every roll on
the haste gaunts. Gotta love random luck.

    Our calendar got wiped when the top guild decided the old calendar was
being abused horribly. And it was. Person X, unguilded, would book a "X and
friends" raid, where his friends would all turn out to be from guild Y. Then
guild Y would book a raid on the same target right afterwards, then guild Z
would book a raid and the raid would be two people from Z and the rest from
Y.... There were some rough spots early on with going FFA, like guilds
hovering at zone heckling raids, but we avoided a lot of the "train 'em out
and roll over 'em" nonsense that happened on other servers. Raids in
progress were respected until they'd lost just one time too many.

    They can expect Naltron, though, and that's the same gem. :-)

    Trust me - between mobs that "forget" to drop plat, mobs that never drop
plat, and subtle pickpocketing by the rogue (one pick per mob is VERY hard
to detect), you don't average 5 pp per mob. I'm a cleric - I wish!

    If the cost is 5 pp per stack, then ask for a paw/bangle/scalp every so
often to cover expenses. Just one of those sells for about 20 pp, enough to
cover four stacks, and the weight shouldn't be TOO bad if you're losing
weight from losing Shuriken stacks.

    I get the idea the mob is being blocked by the tent itself. I've had
more than a few "cannot see this target" when using stuns to pull kobolds
out of there. Are you getting actual hits?

    If you're symboling three people, that's a savings of 21 pp (best
faction/CHA price on a 'dot) per 45 minutes. It adds fast.
