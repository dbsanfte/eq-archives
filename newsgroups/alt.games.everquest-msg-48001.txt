True, they *shouldn't* <grin> and yet when I wasn in there a couple
weeks ago it was still littered with bodies and echoing with screams of
"TRAIN!!!!"
  I dont' care what anybody says. The "new and improved" Runnyeye has

kill the evil eye prisoners for a piece of crafted armor I'd skipped
earlier on, but I felt bad for the folks low enough to get xp. That
