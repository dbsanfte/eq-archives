All of the above is true.  Megami is written with the characters for woman
and retainer (or princess), even though it sounds like it should be an
alternate pronunciation of "kami" meaning divinity.  As a name it is often
pronounced Megumi.  None the less, even though it is written as Megami in
Kanji (but not in hiragana), and has the meaning of goddess, the effect is
the same as naming the child "Charity."  It's the difference betwen literal
meanings, and connotations.

The same reason any of us should be expected to know basic Farsi.

Gottin, from my two years of German, could be determined.  Diosa, or Deesse
can be inferred by anyone with even a small bit of understanding of Latin
roots.
