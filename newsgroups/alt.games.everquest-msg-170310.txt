A) I didn't see him as 'flaunting his sexuality'.  I mean, he didn't 
even flirt with anybody in the entire movie.  Where the hell is the 
sexuality coming in?  B) Nope, doesn't annoy me.  I have friends who do 
the same thing.  It's who they are, and as long as it's not an act of 
some kind, it doesn't bother me.  I'm rather amused by those confident 
enough to do so.
