Hmm, a bard doing CC only should be able to keep 4 mobs mezzed, and 
possibly a 5th, but it's dicey.  If I have time to get 5 songs up I'm 
going to mez 4 and sing my AE slow/snare instead, and just hope the tanks 
can taunt that 5th one along with the target mob.  It takes between 3 and 
6 mobs to overwhelm a bard, depending on the skill and the connection.  It 
only takes one hard-hitter to stun the bard and make him nothing more than 
a good looking ranger though.  <bfg!>

The most they will kite efficiently is 4.  One charmed as a pet, 3 others 
beating on it.  Break charm, drop a couple dots on the former pet, select 
a new pet, repeat.  I'm acutally not sure if it's 4 or 5, but I've 
generally kept my swarms to 4 mobs.  You CAN pull more than that if you 
stay at maximum song range, but it's risky.  (It has something to do with 
only 3 or 4 mobs attacking a critter at once.)
