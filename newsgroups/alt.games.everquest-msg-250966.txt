Your kidding me right? Did you stick-up a bank to afford all this? I
just built a new machine with:

AMD Athlon 2600+
1 Gig RAM
40 Gig Western Digital HD with 8 Meg buffer
ATI Radeon 9800 Pro 128 Meg memory
ABIT NSF-7 S motherboard

and this system rocks for EQ. Why on earth would you spend so much and
buy such new hardware for EQ?
