Check out the City quests. I've found 4 NPCs who give them:

1) Wanderer Greencoat who stands at the foot of the tree elevator in Elddar 
Grove;
2) the Pupil who is the first NPC on the left as you enter the Mage's tower 
in SQeynos;
3) Guard Williamson who stands on the right side at the bottom of the stairs 
leading up to the castle in NQeynos; and
4) Caretaker Nogfizzle standing at the tree just outside the entrance to the 
Temple of Life.

Hail each one of them. It won't be obvious that they've given you a quest, 
but after you hail them you'll see new entries in your quest journal under 
City Quests. Completion of these quests will yield Status Points that 
accumulate over time and show up in your Persona window. Each time you 
complete one of their quests, you'll see a yellow text message along with 
your experience award "You have received 1100 Status Points!" (they range 
from 1000-1400 or so). Then, go back and hail the NPC. This time you'll get 
a message from them thanking you and giving you another "writ" for a new 
task. They're apparently infinitely repeatable. Not the most interesting 
quests in the world, mostly of the variety "Kill 0/11 scarecrows", hopefully 
they're just placeholders for something more interesting to come.
