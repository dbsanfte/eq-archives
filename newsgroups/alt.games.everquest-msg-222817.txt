Not that it's completely immune but thanks to the one-character rule,
the FV server has fewer twinks. Doesn't prevent higher-levels from
re-rolling and starting over as uber newbies, or preventing people
from buying plat with real money... but I still see a large number of
new players in the server who are running around questing for their
newb armor.
