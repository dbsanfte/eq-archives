The difference in mana regen between C2 and KEI is not that large. 14 
points for KEI, 11 points for C2/Gift of Pure Thought.  Pre C2, it would 
have been rougher.  Pre KEI, wizards that slugged it out to quadding levels 
could then start getting xp faster soloing than grouping.  No question, 
wizards were considered a solo class for a long time, due to the low 
sustained DPS vs a single mob.  OTOH, in an AoE group, they are highly 
desirable.  Personally, I never looked for the perfect people to make the 
perfect group, I grouped with people from all classes, without KEI.
