Since your chances of getting the name back the normal method might be
slim (whilst some say they always get name back no problem, starting
around Luclin or so I have never been able to retrieve a name
normally..I'd wait for days...nada), I would still try.  The guide I
talked to did tell me that the name I wanted, Grimalkin, was illegal.  
Because there are grimalkins in Loio. Well, there are rats and snakes all
over the place...it's not a name but a kind of animal damnit...so I
ignored them and went to the top.  If you like the name that much, it
would be a shame not to try at least, though I recommend the "email a GM"
method.  It isn't like you are asking for GAndalf or Skywalker.  Or maybe
you are...where does the name Parsifal come from? (All I recognize is a
similarity to "Percival")
