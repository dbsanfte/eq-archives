As a mage, you don't really need that many spells memmed at all times.
Yeah, there are a lot of prep spells to cast, but those can be swapped
out once they're cast. I have 3 spell lists on my quick-swap. 2 set-up
summon lists, and a normal combat list. The 3rd one doesn't even
require all 8 slots, so I have a couple fillers.

USE the spell lists. They're your friend. Really.
