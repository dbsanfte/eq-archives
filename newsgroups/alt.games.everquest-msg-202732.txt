Well, if you're creating a caster class and they're not evil, you could do
what I do: Farm CB or DF belts (I farm the Orcs right outside the entrance
to Crushbone or at Orc 2 in EC if they're not camped), give them to the alt,
and turn them in. That'll help for the first 12 lvls or so.

(Shouldn't be done with a hybrid or pure melee class, though, for obvious
reasons)
