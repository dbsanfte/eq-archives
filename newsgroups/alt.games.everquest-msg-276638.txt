Please, I don't want all you helpful people to start sniping at
each other over my question!  I appreciate all of the answers and
links that have been given.

As it happens, all of the mobs where we observed the odd behavior
*were* undead (in Field of Bone and later Shadeweavers), so the
undead-take-proximity-more-seriously answer is probably the main
factor in my case, but I'm happy to hear all of the other info as
well, since this is my first real "tank" class and I'm trying to
learn all I can about aggro management.

I think my filters are set up NOT to log "other people's misses",
so I don't get to see when my wife swings unless she hits.  So she
may well have had some swings as well as proximity, and Kaev's info
suggests that number of swings, weighted by some measure of potential
damage, could be relevant.  I think we were both using fairly wimpy
weapons, though; I didn't want to twink us too heavily while she's
still just getting used to the game. :-)
