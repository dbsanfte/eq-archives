1.  All commercial large-scale DBMS products are built for scalability
*first*.

2. I've seen bigger databases than EverQuest needs run and maintained
by companies with less than two dozen people as a support for their
core business.

3.  Presuming the EverQuest database is even vaguely normalized, items
like new inventory slots, houses and the like would merely add rows to
tables. If things were really so perilous that adding rows to tables
would destabilize the system, the whole thing would collapse when
people added new characters.

4. Several major new features were just added to EverQuest (like AA)
without blowing up their databases.

5.  I've run significantly larger databases than EverQuest would need
(hundreds of tables, millions of rows) on the machine I use to PLAY
EverQuest.

6.  Concurrency issues aside, you could build the EverQuest game
database in Microsoft Access.

7. Anybody who's ever built a working database would know that he's
talking out of his ass.
