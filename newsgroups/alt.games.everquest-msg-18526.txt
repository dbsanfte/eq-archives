Greetings!  Was wondering if anyone knows why the Frostwrath is NOT human
useable?  It's a Paladin/SK sword usable by ALL possible SK/Paladin races
except humans....

Was this an omission or was there a reason behind it? If it was intentional,
that's fine, but I'd love to know why exclude Humans.  Any explanation would
be helpful.
