Unless you actually play on his server with him, there will be no change, I
predict.  The newsgroup is harder to leave than the game. :-)

I cancelled both accounts a couple months ago, for example.  The main was on
monthly billing, and has about 3 days left.  The secondary was on six month
billing, and is still active.  I've been on about three times on that one
since cancelling, all to just pop-in and look at some change I've read about
in messages here.
