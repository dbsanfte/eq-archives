Ok maybe I didn't explain myself fully. The GM's WILL summon your corpse 
for you if you die and the corpse is inside a wall, etc. out of 
summoning range due to a bug as you said. I KNOW that has happened in BB 
before. And probably will continue forever. I also know that SOME 
(operative word here) GM's will take pity on you and summon your corpse 
from certain other areas (namely Sol and LS lava pits). It really 
depends on their mood and how busy they are on that one. If not, you hit 
the nail on the head. And I agree, for MOST CR's they shouldn't.
