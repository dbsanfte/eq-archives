It seems to me that God is right now destroying Satan's works. It won't
happen immediately but it will happen now that the beast is dead.

I think the world will be as a heaven when this over, during Christ's
1000-year reign. I would assume that will occur in 7 years after the last of
Satan's legions have been cast into the lake of fire.

I'm very weary and the road has been long. I believe this is the 4th quarter
of my life and it's time to suck it up. I suppose that in 3.5 years I will
either be killed or just silenced, since the prophecy says that no one can
harm me, I would have to assume that will mean I will just be silenced at
the end.
