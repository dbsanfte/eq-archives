People shouldn't have children if they don't WANT to *raise* children.  I
stated it very badly though, (and I misspelled sentiment too... I was half
asleep.....)
To have children because "someone's got to to propogate the species" is a bad
reason.
I do know plenty of full time working people who are also very good parents.  I
also know stay at home *parents* that do a terrible job of parenting.  
It really wasn't my intent to overgeneralize, which I certainly did.
