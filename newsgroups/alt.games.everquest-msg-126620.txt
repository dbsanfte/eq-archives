Verant should make it easier to really use the test server.  I think what
was recently done in DAoC would work well for EQ: allow players to copy
one character to the test server.  Here's how it worked over there:

1. You made a new character on the test server, then logged in and issued a
command, specifying a server and character name of one of your real
characters.

2. Sometime in the next 12 hours, that character would be copied to the test
server.  The original is undisturbed.

This would work really well, I think, in EQ, because people would copy over
and try new things that might be too risky to try on their regular server,
because of XP loss.  That's exactly what you want people doing on a test
server.
