The Elder Spirit of Enlightenment in Jade's Tavern provides the
following script to Shaman who do not have Epic 1.0 done:

Elder Spirit of Enlightenment says 'It appears you are not yet ready
for the great tasks that I require to be done. There are others lesser
than me that can guide you and prepare you to walk a greater path
should you choose. You should seek them out. You can perhaps seek
knowledge from your elders and peers.'


So the question is: Who would these 'elders and peers' be? 


 I have tried all the guild masters in my hometown but the do know
respond to statements such as: I seek knowledge.

Any suggestions?
