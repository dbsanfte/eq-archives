As did most of us who walked the path of the Heyokah. I know I had this 
romantic vision in my head of what a Shaman was all about, based on my 
understanding of the role of Shaman in various tribal cultures that I'd read 
about. When the opportunity came to play one, and with a race (Barbarian) 
that actually looked like it suited that vision, I jumped at the chance and 
enjoyed most of the ride. Once the reality of the game mechanics became 
clearer, however, and the profound disappointment over my crummy and mostly 
useless medicine man profession (EQ's "Alchemy") set in, I lost a lot of the 
original enthusiasm and tried to make the best of it, eventually abandoning 
even that effort. Still, it was a great ride and I'm proud of what I 
accomplished as Shaman and I have much respect those of you who have 
continued braving the way forward. But I honestly don't think I'd play the 
class again if I were restarting EverQuest today.

Especially when there's the opportunity now to play Shamans in other games 
coming on the scene ...
