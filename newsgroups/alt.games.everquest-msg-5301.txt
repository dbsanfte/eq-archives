You know, I haven't had much to say about the current round of silliness - I
was kind of hoping it would quickly fade like the rest. I have found each of
the FA folks' posts to be completely worthless, whereas Bizbee has often
posted informational, friendly, and occasionally clever notes.

And then this?

Please folks, let's try to rise above the petty nonsense, shall we? Really,
who cares what some cretin thinks of himself, and his newsgroup clique? Most
of us have the intellectual capacity to recognize a sad and lonely child
that has been shunned by society, and turned to the relatively anonymous
digital world where he can feel better about himself.

Whatever lies one tosses out about the quality of their life (ie., cars,
job, Swedish bikini team, etc., ) does it make ANY difference here? Or in
any other newsgroup, for that matter? I humbly ask again... please try to
avoid the temptation to get embroiled in another completely pointless flame
war... it can only serve to diminish other peoples' opinions of you.
