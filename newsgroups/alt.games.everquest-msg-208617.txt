Hmm, tried to take a boat from Sisters of Erosi Island across the zone.
Now I appear to be stuck on the zone. /loc changes in the .01 fractions.
I can not leave ths spot by leve either. Can not try swimming away as I
can not get below the little boat either. 

Any suggestions?
Just thought I would ask the newsgroup whilst I wait for a petition to
be answered.
