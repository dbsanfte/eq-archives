As I hear it, they're not removing the manastone, just making it
non-functional in new zones and zones that receive make-overs. Over
time I suppose it will amount to the same thing, but not immediately.

And what I think about it is "who cares?" The number of people who
have them is probably an insignificant percentage, and the chance that
I'll ever be grouped with one of them and thus receive any benefit
from it is vanishingly small.
