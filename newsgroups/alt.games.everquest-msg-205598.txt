You guys must have had alot more money than I did.  I can remember buying *one*
of each ingredient and praying they "combined" .... Of course my ranger was my
first character and it was back in the bad "old" days... 
You can buy good arrows fairly cheap in the bazaar now, (if I'm reallly reallly
bored I'll make up a batch myself.  They come in handy for long distance
pulling, when my Tolan's arrows just won't go the distance.  My fletching skill
is now 165).
I got my first bow off a gnoll in blackburrow and used it for a *long* time. 
Actually, some guy commented on my trashy bow and I replied "I'll have a better
one when I can *make* it.  He laughed and gave me a very *nice* bow for a
newbie, (no stats or anything, but alot better than the gnoll bow).
I never even contemplated buying one from a shop.
