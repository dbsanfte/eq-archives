You are way beyond criticizing. 

"Statwise, Halflings are far better than any of the other choices.
However, a lot of current Rangers are Not Amused by Halfling Rangers
and will not give you the time of day if you play one."

"And the last thing we wanted as a class was a new racial selection
that not only has obscene stats, but gets an experience BONUS.  We
don't need whiny little twinks running around, didn't need to see
people PLing their peck Rangers to 60 in days, and frankly are more
than a little peeved about having had to work through nearly 50 levels
(in my case) with a 40% PENALTY, only to see someone else get such a
free ride."

It is one thing to criticize Verant for the addition. It is another to
label and ostracize people who choose to play the class. You are not
judging Verant you are judging those that decide to play the new
race/class combo.

What I am seeing is an old-school Ranger drunk on "sour grapes". If
you represent the EQ Ranger community as a whole, I feel sorry for the
lot of you.
