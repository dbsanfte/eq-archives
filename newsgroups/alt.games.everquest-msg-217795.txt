True. I shoulda called it a PoP solo nerf, that's the only aspect I
was referring to.

Ouch, reading that made my brain hurt! 

I guess it comes down to one's definition of nerf. If, after 6 months
of the game playing the same way, solo exp in PoP is dropped by 20% it
fits my definition of a nerf. How that point was reached is irrelevant
in my eyes <shrug>.
