Well, I ran it with all luclin models and animations, LOW textures,
particle effects off (3d effects and spell effects), no old world
textures upgraded on a

p2 400
384 meg ram
tnt 16 meg agp card

I basically did pretty well, mostly only graphically lagging 
around lots of people. Without luclin models on I did great.
So judging by that, I'd say without the luclin models 

p2 400 or 350
256 meg ram
tnt 16 meg card.

I just upgraded my graphics card though and got a
geforce 2 mx 400, 65 meg ram for 45 bucks. So really
that is better than getting a tnt or some lesser card. P2 400's are
not even around anymore as far as I know, so you could probably get

Celeron 800 or above
Geforce 2 mx 400 64 meg
MB
256 meg dimm, or even 512 meg one

as about your cheapest option.
With 512 meg ram, you could run it
with 3d effects on, all luclin models and animations,
low textures (in options) with no problem. 

Besides the geforce card, I now only have 576 meg ram 
as the only other difference from when I got luclin. I play
really well now.

You need 2 seperate accounts and software sets per character, to play
both at once. You can Xfer a char over to the new account, with its
items, for like 50 bucks I think from verant. If you want all kunark,
luclin, velious you'd have to buy the trilogy account and luclin. If
you were getting verant Emails you probably got the free trilogy cd
key, in which case you could use that and you'd only need to get
luclin (if you even wanted luclin)
