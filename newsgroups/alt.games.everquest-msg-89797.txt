Hi all, 

Excuse my ignorance, but have only been playing for a little over a
month. Recently ported over to EC to buy something from a friend, and
seem to be kinda lost. I made it back to the area I ported into which
I believe is an ancient pyrimid. Now I finished the trade, and lost
the person that ported me in from LOIO, and am unsure kinda how to get
back. I have checked and noticed there is a ship that leaves from
Oasis that goes to Kunark (Timorous Deep I think), which leads to
Fiornia Vie, where I believe I am KOS. I have killed thousands of
Gobbies, so not sure of my faction hit now. Once in FV I believe LOIO
is right next to it though. Am I better doing this, or asking for a
port to DL and pray I make it through there to FM? If anyone is
heading to LOIO please that can port me please send a tell to GECKOOL
I will donate.

Thanks.
