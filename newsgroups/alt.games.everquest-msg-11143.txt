Thats why a monk parks by the cleric. Cleric hits DA and /q the monk fights
for the few seconds DA isn't in effect and then FD. Cleric waits a few
minutes relogs in and monk and cleric do CR and Rezzes.
Works pretty well

Can it be used as a /camp helper?

What I'm thinking of is a big raid where the leader yells out "CLERICS
CAMP!!!"

If you hit DA or DB and sit and /camp, what happens when a critter hits you?
Does it make you stand up and abort the /camp?

Granted, I know that they only last 18 seconds and camping takes 30.  That
leads me to another question...in those 18 seconds how likely (from
experience, please) is it that someone else will get its attention off of
you for those remaining 12 seconds?  Obviously, if being hit aborts your
camp, don't bother answering this question. :)

Thanks!
