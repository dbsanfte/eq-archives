Depends.  If the cleric is a dark elf, he/she can most likely snare, using
his/her Regent Symbol of Innoruuk, a level 30 or so quest item that should
be a requirement for a dark elf cleric to play past that level.  Clinging
darkness may not seem like much by that level, but you'd be amazed how much
headache that 10% slow can prevent when you don't have anyone else in the
party to snare.
