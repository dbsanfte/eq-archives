No news.  A few rumors but nothing even a little credible.  Given how
completely unable SoE has been to deal with charm in any rational way, I
wouldn't hold your breath.

At best, they'll add a version that has a bigger version of the OoW nerf
built into it, so that DPS won't be much better than your L66 animation.
