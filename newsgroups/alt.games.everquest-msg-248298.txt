Well I dunno about moving but if they don't sort out RN which has been down
at least 8 times in the last 4ish days, then they might loose everybody on
RN. you actually can't really play on Rodcet right now because you might go
LD at anytime, I know that's true of all servers but it's a very real risk
ATM that if you start an adventure you might not get a chance finish it.
Ceri :o)
