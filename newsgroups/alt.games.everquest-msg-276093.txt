HOW TO MAKE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON PAYPAL.COM

THIS IS REAL...
        TAKE YOUR TIME AND READ THIS.....
                 NOBODY IS SCAMMING YOU
                         THE 5 MINUTES IT WILL TAKE YOU TO READ
                                  THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR FUTURE!
                                          TURN $6 INTO $6,000++!!!
HOW TO MAKE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON PAYPAL.COM

                           I'm sure you've read these letters asking
you to send $1 to 6 different addresses. Putting your home address or
mailing address on the internet can be risky, but through paypal all
you have to provide is your email address. It's safe and easy just go
to www.paypal.com and set up your FREE account! No credit card needed.
                          I am not a gullible person and Have never
trusted things like this, but I gave it a try, hey its only $6, I
figured at least 6 people would respond out of the millions of people
that use the internet. You should give it a try too! You have nothing
to lose, and $$ thousands to gain! Read on for the letter that I
found...

HOW TO TURN $6 INTO $6,000++!!!
              THIS REALLY CAN MAKE YOU EASY MONEY!!!
IT WORKS!!!
             BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW IT TO THE LETTER FOR IT TO
WORK!!!!

                        A little while back, I was browsing through
newsgroups, just like you are now and came across an article similar
to this that said you could make thousands of dollars within weeks
with only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, "Yeah, right,
this must be some kind of scam" but like most of us, I was curious, so
I kept reading.
                       Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 though
paypal to each of the emails stated in the article. You then place
your own email address in the bottom of the list at #6, and post the
article in at least 200 news groups. (There are thousands) No catch.
That was it.
                       So after thinking it over, and talking to few
people first, I thought about trying it. I figured what have I got to
lose except $6.00,right? Like most of us I was a little skeptical and
a little worried about the legal aspects of it. It follows the same
regulations as the "mailed chain letters, which according to the U.S.
Post Office (1-800-725-2161) is indeed legal! Then I invested the
measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!? Within 7 days, I started getting
money in my paypal account!
                       I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but
the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about $15.00.
By the end second week I had made a total over $800.00!!! In the third
week I had over $6,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my
fourth week and I have made a total of just over $21,000.00 and it's
still coming in rapidly. It's Certainly worth $6.00.
                      I have spent more than that on the lottery!!!!
          Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it
works? Also, make sure you print a copy of this article now, so that
you can get the information off of it as you need it.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

REQUIREMENTS: You must have a confirmed paypal account. If you do not
Have a paypal account you can go to www.paypal.com and follow the
instructions to set up a free account. In order to place the initial
$6 into your account, you will have to confirm your bank account with
paypal (which may take a few days).

                       Paypal is 100% secure and is used my millions
of people world wide. Confirming a www.paypal.com  account simply
means
 (1) paypal will first ask you to confirm the email you used to sign
up your paypal account by sending you an email with a link for you to
click to that email. As soon as you click that link your email is
confirmed.
(2) Paypal will then make two small deposits into your bank account if
you set up your paypal account with a checking or savings bank
account. Or paypal will make two small deposits to your credit card if
you set up your paypal account with your credit card.
                     Then after a few days (it takes up to a few days
for these deposits to appear in your bank account or on your credit
card statement) then after a few days you go back to the
www.paypal.com  website and sign in. Then you click where it says this
account is not yet confirmed. A screen will pop up that gives you 2
boxes to fill in.
                      You then enter the numbers of the 2 small
deposit amounts (two separate
2 digit numbers) that were deposited to your bank account or credit
card. Now you have a working and confirmed paypal account and can
receive payments.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
[STEP 1]
                Send, though paypal, $1.00 to each email on the below
list. Make the subject of the payment "Email List" and in the
comments, write "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR EMAIL LIST." What you are doing
is creating a service by this - and best of all you are not giving
your address to anyone you do not know.

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!! YOU ARE CREATING A SERVICE.
The email list...... Paypal accounts are on this email lists;

#1) sunnyasd_fusion@yahoo.com

#2) samantha.garry@gmail.com

#3) mr_skunky29@yahoo.com

#4) cashflowgreen@hotmail.com

#5) jpenner_9472@hotmail.com

#6) giveitatry@usenet.com


WWW.PAYPAL.COM  Subject of Payment: ***Email List***

Comments: ***PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR EMAIL LIST.***

[STEP 2]
                Now take the #1) email off the list that you see
above, move the other addresses up one (6 becomes 5 & 5 becomes 4,
etc) the put YOUR email address (the one used in your paypal account)
as #6) on the list.

**MAKE SURE THE EMAIL YOU SUPPY IS EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS IN YOUR
PAYPAL ACCOUNT.**

[STEP 3]
                Change anything you need to, but try to keep this
article as close to original as possible. Now, post your amended
article to at least 200 newsgroups, message boards, etc. (I think
there are close to 32,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember,
the more you post, the more money you make - as well as everyone else
on the list! In this situation your job is to let as many people see
this letter as possible. So they will make you and me reach!!!!

You can even start posting the moment your email is confirmed.
Payments Will
still appear in your paypal account even while your bank account is
being confirmed.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Now the WHY Part: Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies
(a very low example). So then I Made $5.00 with my email at #6 on the
letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the
MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my
email at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that
is another $25.00 for me.
           Now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my email at
#4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00!
          Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200
with my email at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an
additional $625.00!
          OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post
a MINIMUM 200 letters with my email at #2 and they only receive 5
replies that just made me $3,125.00!!!
           Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200
newsgroups with my email at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200
newsgroups react I will receive $15,625.00!
         With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING!! When
your email is no longer on the list, you just take latest posting in
the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to emails on the list,
putting your email at number 6 again. And start posting again.

                 The thing to remember is, do you realize that
thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and
reading these articles everyday, JUST LIKE YOU are now!!
                So can you afford $6?? And change your destiny???
              Just see how it works!! Think It!! People have said,
What if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what
are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest
users and new honest people who are joining the internet and
newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try?
              Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day,
with thousands of those joining the actual Internet. Remember, play
FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will work. Seriously, most people think
this is a scam, but you actually do get thousands of dollars out of

sending out $6, it works!!!!! Post a follow-up to this message!!
