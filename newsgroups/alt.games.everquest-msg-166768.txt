Exactly... Due to an unfortunate deleveling accident in The Grey (in 
which I learned that vacuum actually tastes like chicken), I've decided 
to stay 53 for a while and concentrate on AA in JPF. At 54, about two 
thirds of the griffons and almost all of the willowisps go cyan, and I 
doubt I will be able to find another zone where XP and loot are so 
plentiful for a soloing Druid. After I get my Baron title and a whole 
mess of extra wisdom, then I'll move on.
