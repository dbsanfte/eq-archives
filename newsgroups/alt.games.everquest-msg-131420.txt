First off I didn't say 2K or XP had a "slowness" problem. I said they
were slower than a properly tuned Win98SE. (WinME is a joke and the
biggest load of crap on the market). It is a proven fact that 2K/XP
runs slower in games/benchmarks. It is more noticable in some
games/benchmarks than others. If you have a high-end processor and
video card you may not notice the difference. People with low-mid
level systems will, and it should be considerred before buying 2K or
XP.

I also stated that if Win98SE was tuned and working well for someone
they had nothing to gain by upgrading. Win98SE can be very stable if
properly tuned and running on good hardware. Assuming their current
system is stable there is no reason for a Win98SE user to upgrade
unless they are looking for even better stability, or better security.
