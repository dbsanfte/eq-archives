I rarely if ever post but this is a topic but I felt the need to say
something.

Do not change the NO DROP flag. Cant buy or sell these already. This
protects the quest and flagged portions of the game.

Putting an item in a Non-Plat real money trader container makes it NO DROP
maybe even LORE.

You could not but something you had more than 1 of in the bag. Although this
would not stop farming as you could mule would make the effort a lot harder 
for the "I'm here just to
make a buck not play the game". Point: I have no problem with the I'm here 
just to make a buck as long as you share the MOBS.

Once its in the bag you can not do anything but sell it once and the person
buying it can not sell it ever.
