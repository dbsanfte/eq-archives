And thereby force all the purchasers of product X to pay for the stupidity
of said person or persons.  The one thing it has going for it is that it's
probably less costly than having the government take care of it.  The
problem that arises is that the manufacturer ends up not just paying the
medical expenses, but paying additional "damages" as well, plus possibly
punitive awards as well.
