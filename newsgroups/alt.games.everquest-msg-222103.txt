My old guild used to farm Doomshade and would see three or four usable
armour drops per clearing of ALL types: ThePinkHelm(tm), Moktor, DM
etc.

Only pair of Greaves I saw drop went to a Bard.  Grrr.

Immune to root/snare/slow, tons of HPs, damage shield, summon.  Not
efficient xp mobs that's for sure. [*]

[*] I might be confused here - it's been a while and we always had at
least 30 people whacking away so they died quickly no matter what.
