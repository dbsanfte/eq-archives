The best way would have to scroll up till pet attacks druid is in the chat
window then do a /report pet, and then to a /petition pet and say that your
pet has killed your druid and mention that the evidence is in the report.
Might have been able to get a free res.  After that do a /bug and also
mention that the evidence is in the /report.  Since it's too late to do that
just do a /bug and explain what happened.
