No. Unless we're seeking out a full group in a tougher zone, I think low
blues are just fine for low-risk steady xp. Recently we logged on in OoT
and wanted to see if the Oracle was up. (Grabbing a couple robes for
twinking.) The oracle is light blue, but his guardian is full blue and
gives normal xp. He his, however, a fairly low blue. This guy has hit
for as much as 99, but often hit's lower, in the fiftyish range, and
he's not insanely fast. But he does do his fair share of damage. There's
no way I could solo him, even with decent clerical buffs.

I pulled him and Tiru started in with the "wait till I'm down two
bubbles and cast Celestial then sit" routine. It's a fairly long fight
against this guy, and it requires several heals over the course of it.
When he went down on that occasion (he was snared by my sword, so no
rooting/nuking was called for) I was down so little health that it
wasn't even worth laying the little heal on me for a top-off, and Tiru
was at 80% mana, where she had been hovering all fight long. This is
almost identical to the pattern we see fighting Seafuries as well. Low
hitting blue mobs that give acceptable xp. How this works out to be
"inefficient" I'll never know, as I was ready to immediately pull the
Oracle after that fight, and we generally chain pull seafures with no
waiting.  The previous day, my sword hadn't proc'd in the last part of
the fight, so she wound up both rooting and nuking and was down well
below half mana at the end of the scuffle, but that's a different
scenario than the pure "Cel vs. CHeal" question.
