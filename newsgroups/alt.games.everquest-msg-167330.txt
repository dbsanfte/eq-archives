I calculated costs in Excel assuming the maximum success rate of 95% on all
but the final combine. Since the trivial is above 250 at that step, I
assumed 50% success as a starting point.

With blue diamonds at only 300 on your server (lucky you!), I get a
breakeven cost of 3.6k. Sell price must be competitive with a Bag of the
Tinkerers (100% weight reduction, weight 1.0) sold by an NPC vendor for 5250
pp with good charisma in Solusek's Eye. This means there is room for a small
profit on your server.

This is not the case on Zebu where the lowest price I see in the Bazaar is
800 pp. That puts the breakeven cost at 7.1k pp here.

The expected number of ingredients per success are:
79.78 tufts
6.32 platinum threads
7.00 blue diamonds
2.11 misty acorns (small correction to your list: only one acorn oil
required per attempt)
7.00 jars of acid
7.37 celestial solvents
7.37 spell research components
16.11 water flasks.

The big problem I see is the 4 stacks of tufts per success. Since foraging
that yourself (if you even can) would take forever, you have to buy them. I
see a few on offer in the Bazaar for 1 or 2 pp, but I strongly suspect that
those are minimum prices when there is no demand. If people start to buy
them, the price will shoot up to reflect the level required and the bother
to forage them. I put them at 2pp in the equation, but the cost might become
significant if you actually try to buy them.

If somebody made enough haversacks to estimate the success rate, please
share the information with us.
