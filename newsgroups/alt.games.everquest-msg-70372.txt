Certainly not getting any information from verant on how many ppl can
no longer play at present. Sure the number varies on a per patch basis
but looking at the numbers in the zones some are down 40% since
pre-SoL days. I was being generous that maybe half that were out
shopping or something. Even I can do that math, and no they didn't go
to the moon, been there doesn't account for the drop. In fact I've
noticed a surprising lack of interest in the place.

Since you seem to be a stickler for details, downtime by definition in
any system contract is measured in time unavailable for usage by a
customer to perform the function for which it was purchased. Doesn't
matter the reason if it is within the providers scope of
responsibility. 

Do you draw a paycheck from sony or something? I've seen way to much
BS from companies to know that this situation is eat up with it.

Its not what is said so much as what not said that tells the tale DT.
On the other hand  look at the chat on eq sometimes, read the forums,
take the rose glasses off and see that a lot of people got royally
screwed.
