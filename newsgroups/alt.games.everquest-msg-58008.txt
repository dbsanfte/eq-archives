Most of these postings sound pretty depressing to me , however I have heard
from most people to simply keep it.

btw , on my server 800p to 1000p is doable for this weapon, Xev.  This of
course is an opinion!

So , I shall keep it , and be happy with it.  I tend to level slowly not over
twinking or stuff like that, more interested in travelling around and the
social side of things, of course this requires some experience and ability to
hit things ;)

Thanks for the info all , you have again been very helpful.
