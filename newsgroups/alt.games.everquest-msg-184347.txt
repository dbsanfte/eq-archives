On the EQW part yes - haven't really tested dualling with EQ windowed 
mode yet.  The one real problem I've had is since EQ windowed mode went 
live, EQW is nuts with random crashes.  About 75% of the time I can't 
use it anymore because when one instance is completely logged in, I'll 
minimize, start up the other (separately installed on a different drive) 
and it'll crash after server select.  Sometimes closing the first 
instance, loading the second instance, then reloading the first instance 
helps - but that adds even *more* time loading and reloading.  And 
sometimes it doesn't help either.  :/  With EQ windowed mode, running 
two at once (both eq windowed or one eq windowed and one EQW) I often 
find that while doing something with one char, the other has just 
crashed to desktop.

*sigh*  Come back to me, days of when EQW was not allowed...
