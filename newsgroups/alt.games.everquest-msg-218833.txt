Shaman or Cleric

Shaman you can straight out tank mobs.
Cleric you can either straight out tank mobs or fear kite ANY mob.

Depends on your rangers level, to the second part, that depends on your
guild's attitude towards powerlevelling I guess.

+mana until level 30ish for cleric, switching to +wis.  Focus items for
healing, reagent conservation and extended range are handy.

For a shaman, do the PoK quests and you can kit yourself out in Focus II
items almost for free, get all you can for him.  Remember a shaman is a
pretty awful healer up until at least 44 where they get stoicism, and dont
get superior healing until 51.
