Yeah, I went to RM with my 55 enchanter to fart around.  Lots of lower level
guildies were talking about the fun to be had.

But they're warriors.  I nuked some green-to-me undead wurm thingy and it
was resisted.  Damn.  Ok, I'll just mez him and be on my way.  Resisted.
Damn.  Ok, so I'll outrun it to the zone.  I'm lost again.  Damn.  The thing
is near SoW speed and I don't have Gate memmed.   Damn.    After 5 minutes I
either finally lost it, outran it, or someone else pissed it off more...I
don't know.  I memmed Gate at the first opportunity and got back to
Thurgadin.  Oh well, sucks to be an enchanter.  I'll get over it...I'm over
it. :)

It brought many guild members endless pleasure.  They were talking about it
all week.  Since I'm a guild leader any day that my members are happy is a
good day for me.
