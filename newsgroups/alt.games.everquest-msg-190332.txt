Spiderling silk goes for 2-5pp, and is very accessible to
newbies. Playing the buy low, sell high game is pretty easy in the
bazaar, too; I've made 800pp into something like 40-60k in a month. I
don't think I would have managed that before the bazaar, because it
would have required more of a time investment. Now there is tons of
stuff available, it's just a matter of finding the people who want
their money now, damnit, and then being patient waiting for stuff to
sell.
