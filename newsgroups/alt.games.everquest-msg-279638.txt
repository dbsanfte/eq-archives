There are enough of them that it would definitely change the game.  You have
to be aware that I've watched a fairly large chunk of the raid game
completely disintegrate for exactly that reason (which means, by
extrapolation, that a large portion of the "loot whores" have now moved on,
so current impact would be lessened if the rest disappeared).

You'd be even less likely to see raiders and non-raiders mingling.  Load
balancing, when you have coordinated groups of 50+ moving around, means one
guild per instance.

Guild building is *hard*.  Surely you've seen, or maybe you haven't from
your perspective but I definitely have, many failed attempts at "uber"
guilds.
