Yes, I have noticed that my hotkey locks up and acts strange sometimes... so
I seperated my hide & Sneak from my pick & disarm etc.,

I have disarm, pick and beg on a single macro together.  This helps me pull
agro when needed and helps me build those skills easily.

Don't you have to sneak AND hide to evade combat?

Because sometimes I need the agro back on me... if the main tank is getting
slammed or I'm with a caster or something.. who knows.  It's there if it's
needed or if it looks like it might be fun...

Bah, if they can't handle a little agro.. they shouldn't be fighting the MOB
in the first place... right?  I don't group with anyone who can't stand up
against the MOB.  At lower levels this works just fine.  - Though, at higher
levels of course, the strategy has to change.  I'm not arguing strategies
with you, I was simply sharing a couple of macros that I have set up to
increase skill in abilities where possible.  So you don't like to practice
pick pocket... not a lot of people do, but hell, it only takes a second to
do it.. if my char doesn't have a second to try a pick, then my character
should have been running away 5 seconds ago.
