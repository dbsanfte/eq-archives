Being a large race and unable to cast shrink or wolf form except via
potions, I'll probably pony up for the key.  I think I've gotten my
faction up high enough to be able to shop in Paineel, though if not
I can use a rogue shroud as suggested earlier.

But what I haven't seen anywhere is how does the key work?  Is it
like the key to Old Sebilis, where each person needs his own key?
Or is it more like in Befallen, where the key lets you open a door
and then multiple people can pass through?
