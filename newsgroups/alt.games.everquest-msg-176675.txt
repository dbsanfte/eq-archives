    It's an educated guess. =) No stats on Allakhazam's, no stats on
EQtraders or posts about them on EQtraders. The first thing people do
generally when they make something like this is go take credit for it, and
the tradeskill community is pretty tight-knit. If someone is a grandmaster,
I'll almost guarantee they know about EQTraders.

    Why haven't I posted, then? Aheh. You see, the wizard I made these for
told me he really wanted them for the stats. So I assumed (bad James!) that
they had been discovered. That night, I went to double-check on EQTraders -
and they hadn't. The wizard had heard me talking about how the earthstrand
and firestrand have reversed MANA/HP amounts, looked at the 90 HPs on the
(known) Earthweave boots and decided that 90 mana on boots would rock. I've
posted on my guild message board for him to give me the stats so I can go to
EQTraders and post them - I didn't bother taking them down.
