Jazz, did someone piss in your Wheaties today?  You don't know the whole
situation.  Is he in school?  Law school?  Med school?  Just out of the
military and unemployed?  Laid off by the travel/tourism industry?  A
stay-at-home dad?

Other than that, you're right.  He should not be worrying about a game
computer before getting the family financial situation in order.

I would love my wife to take care of me.  Not have to work.  Play EQ all
day.  What a life.  I can day-dream can't I?
