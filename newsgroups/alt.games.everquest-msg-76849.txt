Setup is:

P3 - 800, 512 mb pc133 ram
GeForce 3, SB 128pci
Win98 SE, Cable (through a proxy)

The only 'suspect' thing is that the cable modem is connected to
another PC (nearly same specs) also playing EQ and I'm using SyGate to
share the connection. Note however that we've played with this setup
for 6 months without problems at all!

As said, 6 months without lag (except the odd spike) then suddenly out
of the blue this strange lag crops up more and more often. Last night
was virtually unplayable and joining in raids is a no go now >:-(

ARGH!
