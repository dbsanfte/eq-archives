Not leadership...a leaderboard.  There's no penalty for failing a mission
unless you want to be top dog.  The leaderboard tells one and all how many
times your group has won/lost.  It doesn't say much about you as an
individual and if I ever get turned down because of it, it's not a group I
would have wanted to hang with anyway.
