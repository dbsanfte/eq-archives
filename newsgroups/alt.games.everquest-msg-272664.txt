If you're a troll, and you well may be, you're getting a 0.1/10.

If not, then you're completely missing the point of playing computer
games.

When you say "having fun with family and friends, excercising,
traveling, installing a solar energy plant", what you're essentially
describing are free time activities. If you want to go out with your
friends bowling or hiking.. all the more power to you, but don't knock
us staying at home playing games with our friends online. It's
essentially the same thing. Yes, one may get your more physical
excercise, but as recent studies have proven
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/050111/115500_1.html
gamers are normal people. They go to the gym too. They hang out with
their family and friends in real life and ride their bikes and go on
hikes.

Now if you played so much that the games impacted the rest of your
life, you were in the absolute minority of gamers, and essentially an
addict and quitting games may be a good thing for you. Given that you
mention making love to your wife... well if you played so much you
didn't have time for THAT,.. you're just an addicted dumbass, and lucky
she didn't leave you yet. But don't knock games for your own faults.
They are not standing in the way of a happy and enjoyable life.

I can't speak for everyone, but personally, while playing EQ over the
last two years, I've taken classes at college, held a full time job
(and gotten two raises in that time), found a new girlfriend, spent
lots of time with my friends on weekends, held parties at my place,
gave up smoking, took care of my pet turtle (i LOVE turtles) and have
developed a new hobby: brewing beer. EQ is just one more thing I really
enjoy doing with my friends.
