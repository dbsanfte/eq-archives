Auto split sucks, take turns looting. The person looting always gets
the lion share of money with auto split and the rest get change.

AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
An uninformed newb is you! Yeah, because its fun to play a game where
you play "step and fetch it" the taxi. "Ise portin for tips massa! any
you fine massas want me to port you for tip? Ise Rufas the porta!
Aight?" Sorry, but that is not fun to do nor something that I ever do.
My playing time is for me, not to be a transportation service. If I'm
going there anyway I'm more likely to take people along for free but
If I'm not going there right at the moment then don't count on getting
a ride.

Guess why? Because no one is porting them. Its not worth 200 plat for
me to zone twice and get back to what I was doing.

I can't believe how naive you are or how poor your attempt at trolling
is ;) Sure, if I logged on to EQ for 3 or 4 hours of play a night and
ported people around I might make 500 - 1000 plat but I'd also not
level or get any items or anything. OOH FUN GAME, YOU TOO CAN PLAY
GIMPY THE PORT SLAVE.

You may as well learn now since someday you'll have to; give everyone
a share of the loot and let people take turns looting (especially take
turns at lower levels when money is important) That druid is doing
exactly what he should be doing, grouping to try to improve his
character. Getting 100 plat to be someone's slave does not help you in
the long run at all.
