Ah.  My wizard is dead slow.  If a slime out of the old Wizardry series is
chasing my Wizard, the slime will catch him.   If it's not rooted, it's
bashing on my feeble frame.  This sort of understanding leads to
enlightenment and staying alive, two very good things -- root is good!.  Not
having any damage over time spells, nor seeing any in the near future, I
hadn't considered that.

Thanks,
Eric
