Hi All

I got DoN today, handed in the crystal you claim as the in-game
freebie, and got the 10 Restoration and 10 Regeneration potions.  Very
nice they are, too...  The vendor you hand the crystal in to,
Frostpouch, seems to hint that he has more of them if I need them, so
am I right in assuming there are more crystals on mobs, somewhere,
that I could hand in?  The Restoration/Regeneration potions are so
nice, restoring all mana and all hit points (2-hour recast time),
respectively, that I want to get some for my alts.

I wish I had noted the name of the damn crystal, as I have been unable
to find out any more details  :(
