Because foresting seems to be the hardest to raise while gathering seems
the easiest. Personally, I think mining is the hardest, but that may
because I can never seem to jump on a rock before someone else does (when I
can find them that is). But I agree that you should harvest from any node
you find no matter the order. But if it was the choice between a rock and
roots I'd take the rock first.
