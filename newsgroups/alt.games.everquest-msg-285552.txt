Wow, you've convinced me never to play WoW.  I love running a healer in
EQ1, I watch 1 or 2 sometimes 3 tanks, my group, and occasionally the
enchanters too, and I don't have the option of having 40 health bars
available.  If Agro and damage in WoW is so screwed up that random
people take damage, and they can't call for help, then no wonder the
game is so screwed up.
