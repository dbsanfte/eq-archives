20 Servers were down yesterday all day. Out of what, 80? If you call
that a minority I guess your right, but 25% is one heck of a minority
and clearly illustrates these clowns dont know how to run a stable
MMORPG. The fact that *everyone* I know has a "backup" server or two
or three really speaks volumes. And youll note that 100% of the people
in that four page thread all agree on the situation, passionately. Yet
nobody posted in defense of Blizzard. That's the situation, and its
getting worse daily as more and more people wake up decide enough is
enough.
