Don't think this will be the case at all. They lost the Rolemaster
license when Rolemaster went under. From what I understand it is still
very level based, and stats are not very important (hopefully they
aren't as meaningless as in EQ, though). I don't know about the "every
character will be *vastly* different" part - I mean, I imagine 98% of
the Healers and Clerics are going to specialize in, well, the Healing
skill tree. Yeah, so they have access to Stat buff and haste and mezz
and whatnot - I really see few actually specializing in them though. I
guess you could say, though, that there will be plenty of ways to
diversify your secondary skills. But the powergamers/min-maxers are sure
to have a perceived "best skill tree" for every class in a few months,
not that that has any bearing on how my friends and I will be playing,
though.

Hmm, I don't know. I think the 'not overly concerned with equip' comes
from not going to DAoC's LGuk equivalent and pharming the best equipment
all day long - that kind of thing won't happen. But I think the game
will be (perhaps dangerously) very pre-occupied with equipment. From
what I've read, the difference in combat effectiveness when using fresh,
slightly above your level equipment compared to equipment you haven't
upgraded in a while is HUGE. Since your items decay, and you need to
constantly be upgrading just to stay effective, I think equipment will
be an ENORMOUS concern. This sounds frighteningly close to AO to me;
hopefully, at least the equipment we'll be upgrading to every few levels
will be different, so at level 50 I'm not using a level 50 equivalent of
the same sword I was using at level 1 (like in AO).

True. Am interested to see how this will turn out. I hated PvP in UO,
EQ, and AO. If this is done right in DAoC, I think I could enjoy it. But
I'm not 100% reassured that I will just yet.

I don't think the claim is that the AI will be commabding 3000 units
intelligently; the claim is that if you see a_goblin_scout01 spying on
you, and you don't kill it, be prepared for a goblin raiding party to
come crashing in on your group while you are resting. Or something like
that. I agree, though, we'll have to wait and see how effectively this
is implemented.

Hmm, I don't know. No one I know of is the least bit interested in
Hibernia. Most of the uber guilds seem interested in Midgard, a few in
Albion. A lot of the hardcore people will want to play in those 2
realms, and I would bet a lot of casual/new players who like things nice
and normal will choose Albion for the sake of simplicity, the fact that
they identify with the humans and with Camelot itself, and because it
looks to have a pretty strong balance in all areas. I personally would
like to try some of the Albion classes first, but my guildmates want to
try Midgard, so that's where we'll be playing at release :)
