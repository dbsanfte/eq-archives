Sitting far enough back that I won't get instant aggro on the pull. 
Have MA targetted, waiting for assist call.  Call comes, I hit assist 
key, GO key; go is
/pet attack
/cast 1
/g casting Mala at the %t

saves putting in a line that says /stand.

On the other hand, I don't really have any further lines I wanted to 
spatula in there, so do I care?

And does the /stand line hurt if I'm not sitting at the moment?  It 
doesn't make the macro fail, but does it result in a slight added delay? 
  If so, then the remake is saving me that portion of a second whenever 
its not needed.

Its fairly rare that I build long chains of casts, because I hate to be 
forced into a long chain in case events suddenly indicate otherwise.

Slower?  That would be me, if you want to count the air pet as  a 
slower.  Finished with a half hour to spare, normal difficulty Guk.

Partial rebuild of same group, now its warrior, two clerics, monk, 
shaman and me, so we did have a real slower.  Hard mission with average 
level 63, we ran into some early trouble where the mobs kept warping on 
pulls and we'd end up with 4 in camp; zoned out several times, lost each 
of the clerics (two different occaisions, so we never actually had to 
stop).  Came down to the wire and lost by one item (collect in MM)

We were all constantly running OOM, used the mod rods that I'd given the 
warrior and monk to hold as backups, we were -this- close.  I loved it, 
even though we lost.  Besides, the 24 points I got as a consolation 
prize were no worse than I've gotten recently on success in missions 
where the average level of the group was lower and we went for a normal 
mission!
