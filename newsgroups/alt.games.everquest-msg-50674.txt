And they are all "fake." By fake I mean the tower of frozen shadow or
what you see at erudin are just polygonal facades. EQ does not render
the building complete with floors there, its just a facade which is
why you must "zone" into the building via the door which has been
programmed to "zone" you in. There really is no building there at all
in 3d terms. If you explore tower of frozen shadow or even the tower
in field of bone you also see they are FAR bigger on the inside then
the outside facade is.

This seperates them from the two or three story buildings you see in
cities which are part of the zone and actual multi storied structures.
