We had 2 mages and the enchanter - the assignments were Me-Mala, Mage2-
Malosinia, 'chanter tash.  The other mage tried several times to land
'sinia (I tried a few on 'sini) and no joy.

Of course, after we took our normal targets that night we took 40 people
up there and ground him into the carpet :)

The problem is that I keep seeing little ways we could have boosted our
dps and finished him with that force.
