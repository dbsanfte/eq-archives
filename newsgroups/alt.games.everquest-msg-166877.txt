Finding a group under 30 is very hard now, unless youre in paludal caverns.
Old common hunting grounds like oasis, SK, loio are almost empty. I was
runing through SK last sunday afternoon (trying to track quilmaine), and
there were about 8 in zone. Some were level 50+, some were anon, and *one*
person was level 30'ish. Bit of a change from the old days when SK has 100+
people in it, all hunting.

loio had 25 people in it at about the same time. Not so bad, but still way
way down on what it used to be. Im on druzzil, which is an average
population server.
