    So smaller group XP bonus, or possibly no group XP bonus.

    Ok. This makes it a bit more specific. If they envision it being
superior for a 10 person raid to break into 4 and 6, then the raid XP
modifier must be worse than the group modifier for a four person group.
Otherwise the four people would stay in the raid. I think that's how it's
going to work out. So if there's two groups of three, they'd be better off
forming a raid - but they'd have been much better off forming a group of
six. But two groups of four would NOT be better off forming a raid, and they
didn't have any options for forming one group before. The whole point is to
prevent people that couldn't gain XP together before from "raiding" solely
for better XP mods.

    Yeah, this sounds like the correct interpretation. I can almost hear
Absor saying that last bit himself. So the raid XP mod will be between the
three-person group XP mod and the four-person group XP mod. I wonder if
three people can form a "raid" and get an XP bonus, then! Or, better yet -
soloists getting "raid" XP!

    They'll have a fixed XP modifier regardless of raid size, I think, but I
bet they don't have fixed XP shares like you've listed. Otherwise, given
enough people in a "raid" (like 60 or so), the fixed share will become an XP
bonus. And limiting the size of a "raid" just runs you into the same
problems you had before.
