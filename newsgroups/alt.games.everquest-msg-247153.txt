You should work for Sony. You've got that CS attitude they're looking for.



The phone call to sony...

Hi, my account was banned./

Sorry you'll have to email the gms, there is nothing we can do here. /click

The email to sony...

Hi,

My account (username=xxxxx) was banned...what did my account do? when 
did my account do it? What ip did my account do it from? What characters 
did it interact with? Can you forward me the relevant logs?? Maybe I can 
figure out what went on at this end...

I was out of town last month and haven't been in EQ at all, and I'd like 
to resolve this quickly.
