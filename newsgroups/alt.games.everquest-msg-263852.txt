The reason I continue to play EQ is the friends I have made who continue 
to play EQ.  I am on the cusp of becoming time flagged with those same 
friends I have had for years now, somewhere I never dreamed I would be, 
and I just don't have time for two MMORPGs, so I will stick with EQ.  If 
I do choose to switch to a new MMORPG, it would likely be a non SOE 
product, I am very unhappy with the direction EQ has taken over time, 
and, from what I see of EQ2, it continues in that direction.
