The one and only time I stood an entire night in the Bazaar, was when I 
was  in trader mode, NOT using AFK and running Everquest in a windowed 
mode (I couldn't get it fullscreen right then) using just the game 
itself, with Edonkey running in the background consuming about 99% of mu 
download, and 80% of my upload.

Ever after I switched Edonkey off, and use EQW to run Everquest in a 
windowed mode, I puty Trader mode ON and AFK ON and every single time I 
crashed back to deksopt the next morning. I don't know after how much 
time it happened, but I never was in the Bazaar, or even the game 
anymore.

Now last two nights I used Eeverquest.exe instead of EQW to launch the 
game, and set up my trader in AFK, and noitced I was thrown back out to 
the login screen. This happened twice tonight, because I checked in a 
03:00 am when I was spooking around the house ;-)

Now I just put Emule back on to consume bandwith, and left the trader on 
with AFK, next time I'll leave AFK off and see what happens.

It's quite a pain in the a$$ to sell items like this in the bazaar. :-(
