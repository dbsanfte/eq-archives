This is the main reason, IMO.  When I was a grouping druid, it was
frustrating trying to make GHeal do much of a job on a warrior.

It gets much more interesting once a cleric gets Complete Heal and
Celestial Healing.  You really have to play a cleric to that level to
appreciate it.  Of course the name of the game is just mana
management, same as with any other caster, and it doesn't really
matter whether you're nuking the mob or healing your party, you're
doing essentially the same thing -- keeping your mana as high as
possible for future pulls while dealing with this one.

I would maintain, however, that the rush for a cleric is actually
greater than that for a nuker on those edge-of-the-seat,
will-we-won't-we-pull-it-out encounters, since he has to make so many
split-second decisions.  A cleric is totally fastened on the party hit
point display and his ruminations on "can I leave him or does he need
a little heal?", "can I get off a celestial before I have to CHeal the
MA?", etc. I at least find totally fascinating.
