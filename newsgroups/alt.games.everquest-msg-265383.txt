I am not too optimistic on behalf of your idea.  The current trend is to 
make lots of laws and leave it to chance whether or not lawbreakers are 
caught.  When someone is brought to justice, it is often by sheer 
coincidence or the curiosity of local journalists, since police and IRS 
and eco-crime units are underfunded and constantly re-organized. The USA 
already has a federal CAN-SPAM law, which is dormant from the day it was 
born.  I receive roughly 100-150 spam mails a day, out of which perhaps 1 
or 2 complies with the CAN-SPAM requirements.  (The vast majority are very 
obviously virus-generated, as the sender name is taken from private 
address lists. Almost none of these would have reached me if the sender-ID 
email protocol proposal had gone through, which it didn't due to internal 
rivalry between Microsoft and AOL.)

With Congress having wasted their time making one dormant law, why would 
they waste their time again making another law that won't be upheld?
