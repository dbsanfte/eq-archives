While its clear reasonably soon that different races start in different 
cities, what isn't clear is that in many cases the areas between those 
cities are incredibly difficult to traverse.  And there's no real rhyme 
or reason to which are difficult and which are easy, either; there's no 
danger moving from Qeynos to Erud or vice versa (unless you're an evil 
erudite, that is, back in the pre Paineel days, this was still safe trip 
but the destination was very scary until you learned about the aqueducts)

A logical approach would be for the areas between the cities to be 
reasonably low level; you might have to go thru some orc pawns or 
something, sure, but the hard stuff would be elsewhere.

A different, equally logical approach, is to make travel between cities 
something difficult, something you have to Earn... thats the Vision at 
work.  Nothing wrong with it, either.  But it isn't necessarily self 
evident when you start out, much less when you're contemplating buying 
the game in the first place.

Simple solution, of course, is the one most of us used; if you want to 
start out playing with your friends, everyone start with the same race. 
  Figure out the game a bit, learn more about the basic possibilities, 
and you could do more; for example gnomes, high elves, wood elves, half 
elves, and even dwarves could get together reasonably easily.    Ogres 
and Trolls can get together easily.  Or, oddly, humans, half elves, and 
Dark elves.

I did think it was weird that they have a whole section of the startup 
devoted to picking your start city, and yet for MOST races, there 
actually is no choice at all.  To my thinking, everyone should have had 
a couple choices, instead of just the one that most get; even if the 
alternate choices were similar to Surefall Glade, rather than complete 
cities, this could have cut down dramatically on the "we can't get 
together" problem, while leaving the world nice and large instead of 
putting in the POK shortcuts (and the Nexus shortcut before that, don't 
forget how much that alone shrank the world)
