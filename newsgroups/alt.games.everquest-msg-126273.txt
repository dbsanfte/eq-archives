It's funny how they always mention slaying dragons.  I held at level 52 for
months trying to find Naggy and Vox raids that fit my schedule.  With the
long spawn time and the huge number of people capable of killing them, it
never worked out.

My guild has talked of doing Trakanon, but probably can't mobilize fast
enough to get to him.  We have had guild outings killing WW dragons, which I
missed, but wouldn't count anyway...the traditional fantasy setting is to
have the dragon in a lair, so I want one in a dungeon, not outside.  It
looks like I won't get any dragon action until we are ready for ToV.
