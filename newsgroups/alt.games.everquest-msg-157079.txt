I actually successfully harmonied out a single caster mob with snare. I
dropped creeping crud and stinging swarm on it and root parked it and sat to
med. Re-applied both dot's and park when ran out (I have extend affliction)
and it ended up at about 2/5 of life and then dropped a 300pt heal on itself
with a decidedly smug look that seemed to say "I can do this all day - ho
hum..."

Hmmn - change of tactic needed to increase rate of damage to above what he
can heal. Reapply dots, throw up damage sheild and wade in...

"54 - ouch! 36 - eek! 53 - ack! 54 - oh my hiney hurts..."

Mind you I am a twinked high AC/HP Druid with 700+ AC so at that stage the
writing was one the wall, where's that gate?
