    Ok, the underlying question remains though. You use a blast heal that
can be improved by HA, but you don't ever see it heal for max? If that's
true, why is it true?

    I avoid SL for three reasons: slowish casting time, aggro, and it's a
mana pig. I usually alternate between SR and CH, only using SL if I'm caught
on a tank where they're too low to CH, but SR doesn't give me enough health
buffer to start a CH. With the spell haste item you have, I can certainly
see using it more.

    I was amazed that the person wasn't being ripped on even more. Leaving a
guild right after getting your last elemental flag, and even worse being
tagged by the other guild the same day, is pretty low on the part of the
individual and the other guild.

    Sigh, Dadorf is in my guild now. He doesn't seem malicious so much as
impulsive to the point of insanity. He'll say whatever comes to mind, and
try and do whatever plan of action he thinks of first. I know he's a
teenager, but still, it's frustrating for me because I want to tear him a
new one when he does stupid things like that. If you've read our server
flame board a lot you may have noticed a thread about Gemlin, an elemental
wizard, stealing various Kunark dragons from raids getting ready to do them.
Well, Gemlin recently joined my guild. You may also notice in one of those
flame threads a very pointed, terse message from me, which another cleric on
the server figured out the real meaning of pretty quickly later in the
thread. I wish the old people that quit the guild hadn't quit, because we
really were something special before. Now, I see us becoming more and more
like just another endgame guild.

    James
