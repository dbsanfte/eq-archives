My three characters are now level 30 and sitting in Nexus: Halfling druid,
Ogre warrior, Barbie rogue.

Problem is I haven't a clue as to where they should be hunting, Luclin,
Kunark, Velious, Old World?

All three are on the same account and my druid hasn't even picked a
specialisation yet.

Any and all suggestions are welcome.

Best regards,

OgreLowbie
