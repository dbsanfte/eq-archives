I was just passing through Sro one time and saw that it was 5pm and decided
to try kill the undead in the tower at 6pm trick, not really expecting it to
work.  Killed it, then just ran around the western part of zone, killing any
undead I came across but not going out of my to.  Soon I encountered Hasam,
and quickly dispatched him.  About 5 min later I see another SG, run over
the sand hill and target it as I do - ANCIENT CYCLOPS!!!   Ran into the
thing forgetting to turn on auto-attack I was so shocked!  Anyway, got him
down, breathed a sigh of relief when he was under half (no others in zone
for him anyway - off peak), nearly had a heart attack when I lagged when
both he and I were 15% life.  But thankfully he musta missed me and my new
regen spell kept my life up after that, and he soon started running.  Had to
log at that point, but when I came back in got the rapier and gold, headed
off to RM with a druid guildmate, got Hasten on track, stopped a mage from
killing him, and got the Jboots.  Prolly took me under an hour playing time
too, though I had to log in between.

My best friend also got them pretty quick, saw the AC kill someone just as
the was running up to them - AC was at 10% life, easy kill.  I helped her
get the rapier and find Hasten, with no track, but fortunately for us he was
not far from the zone (unusual isn't it?), so she got hers in about an hour
too.
