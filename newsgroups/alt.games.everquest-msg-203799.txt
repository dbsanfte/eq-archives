Disease/Poison resist buff, second best haste in the game, the group sow 
has a small ATK buff component, which is nice to add to other buffs.  
Resist debuff lines of spells, root with no damage component, good for 
ghetto mez of summoning mobs.  The shaman DD spells are marginal as far 
as mana efficiency, the DoTs are quite nice.  Group disease/poison cure 
spell, great for Trak raids and CT raids.
