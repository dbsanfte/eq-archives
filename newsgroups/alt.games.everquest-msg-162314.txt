You can still get exp in Marus Seru.  The easiest place to solo there is the
Marus Seru zone because there are not as many wandering MOBs as there are
near the Netherbian zone.  Another good place at around 34 is the mushroom
temple in Dawnshroud.  I good place to set up camp is at the back of the
temple along the zone wall.  You won't get the ADDs here that you will get
if you try to camp around the front.  You could also try Echo Caverns, at 30
the Needlites should be good exp and you have the advantage of a damage
shield which is really helpful with these guys.
