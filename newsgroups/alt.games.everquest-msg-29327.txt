You may as well use Splitpaw gloves instead of these - you can usually
find them for 5pp or so from the aviak or centaur vendors in South
Karana if you can't pick them up auctioning.

Better off buying some Ulthork hide arms.

There's also Burynai hide boots (+2 WIS), high elf cultural chain boots
(+2 WIS for enchanted, the enchanted and imbued version is probably more
WIS, and would be wearable by Tunare druids etc, even though its chain),
Crystal lined slippers (+3 wis, rare drop in Crystal Caverns), and a
bunch of stuff from places like the planes and the hole. You're right
though, wood-elf cultural boots are nice since there's not much else
about at low or mid-level.

Small race WIS casters also have some easy to get WIS footwear - the
acolyte's anklet, and easy but tedious quest involving killing a few
teen level zombies around the world and returning their flesh to the
halfling cleric guild for a nodrop anklet:

Acolyte's Anklet LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP AC: +3 Agi: +2 Wis: +2
Cha: +3 Weight: 1.2 Classes: Cleric Druid Races: Dwarf Gnome Halfling

The anklet is nodrop, but the 4 bits of flesh you need aren't, so you
could auction for them or get a high level alt to do it. The toughest
bit is finding a named zombie in the Feerott, but easy enough for a
druid with wolf-form (so non-aggro to ogre bouncers) and tracking.
Whenever I run into him I grab the flesh for any small race druid or
cleric friends or guildmates - the rest of the quest is simple enough.
An added bonus for halflings is that it has no graphic, so you can show
off your hairy feet - may make it look sucky on other races, of course.

You should count yourself lucky that *one* piece of wood-elf cultural
tailoring is saleable - presumably *no* Vale studded is, since there are
viable alternatives for *every* piece.

Must be the reinforced stuff. Studded mithril boots are 8 morning dew
per attempt (1 dew + 2 small pieces of mithril per mithril bit, 3
mithril bits + file + dew per 2 studs, 4 studs per boot attempt).

I've managed to make a couple of pairs of mithril studded boots with the
5 pieces of oak bark I've obtained (ever) at 107 tailoring.
