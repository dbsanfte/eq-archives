Remember that next time you're in NK with Grimfeather chasing you.  The
guards on the hill are very useful for sacrificing to the griph while you
make your get away.  Same with the giants in that zone.  The seru guards are
pretty useful when you're being greenied to death in Netherbain's lair.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
