You could check on http://www.eqprices.com for a rough idea.
I say rought idea as often a lot of people might not be prepared to pay 
the suggested price especially if an item is over popular.
I had a lot of trouble selling solists icy wand which is a very rare 
item. In the end i got exactly what i paid for it.
For a more accurate price list the items in auction channel and ask for 
a price check on them
