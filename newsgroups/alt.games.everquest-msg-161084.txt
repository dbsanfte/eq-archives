Yes I believe there is.  In fact I believe the new policy states that your
character can be deleted for filing a petition or bug report of any kind.
In addition you can also have your characters deleted for criticizing Verant
or Sony in any way whatsoever.  (Hey! Love you guys-HUGS!!!!)  This is a new
policy which seeks to make customer service more efficient, reduce costs and
allow Sony to channel more funds into better vendor snacks for the
lunchroom.
