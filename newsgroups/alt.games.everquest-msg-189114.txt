Yup. I bought new memory, had random lock ups. This was over six months ago,
maybe things have changed with regard to RAM.  It's (or was) recommended
that you use/buy RAM from the exact same batch. Once I took my new stick out
the lock ups dissapeared.

There's also 3million other reasons why eq may lock you up though :(  bloody
fickle game....
