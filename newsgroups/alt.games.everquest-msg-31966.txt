This is a separate issue from your debate, but how can anyone know/care what
people do in the confines of their own homes as long as no one is hurt?  Are
there spy cameras in our houses?  That would certainly be enough to offend
ME.  I'm about the most boring person you could ever watch but if I knew I
was on such a camera I'd commit illegal acts just to make sure I got the
viewers good and riled.

I wonder why people think anyone will change his private behavior just
because a law says he has to.  The fact that possessing or smoking
marijuana is illegal doesn't have much to do with whether or not people
will.

It's funny how people who become offended at the mere thought that someone,
somewhere, might conceivably be receiving oral sex, never stop to consider
their own large intestines, and how much more literally sordid the
substances and processes are down there.  They'll all die in paroxysms of
self-loathing if ever they leap the chasm to logic.

But that's just my $.02.
