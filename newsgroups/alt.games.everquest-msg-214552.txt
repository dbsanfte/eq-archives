Rarely.  Because I was using small heals, HOT, clicky Valor; and because I'm
reasonably competant as a healer and we weren't pulling POP mobs (this was
obviously way before POP) so we didn't have the "heal on incoming" necessity.
Caster mobs were an entirely different kettle of fish, they didn't get
mitigated by monks, so monks responded to them just as they do to melee damage
now; something that hits a warrior for 20% of his HP total would do 40% or
even 50% (warriors tend to be great at resists) to a monk.

I think they did the right thing in making monks AC work less well, leather
armor -should- do less to help you than plate; I just think they went too far,
overcompensating for how great monks were in the past by making them crappier
than they should be for balance purposes.  Now they are not all that fantastic
as DPS goes, and not at all fantastic for tanking, and most groups have found
ways of dealing with mobs other than using FD pulling, which doesn't work as
well at high levels anyway; if they wanted to pull the tanking leg out from
under monks I think they should have simultaneously boosted their DPS
potential a bit so they'd be competing with rogues and rangers and wizards and
beastlords and mages, instead of being in the unenviable position bards and
druids and warriors are in of "well we can't find someone who can really do
that job, how about we take the monk, he can sort of do it a bit"

Well later the rez part is free... but the down time waiting for the monk to
recover is still there, plus Virtue costs a lot more than Temperance
