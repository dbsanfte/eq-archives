PoK only connects safe areas? Like overthere, great divide, firona vie (in
the middle of the tunnels so its a quick run to dreadlands) etc? I
deliberately rolled up a newbie to explore the ot outpost and see how long
till something killed her. She lasted quite a while. Good ole halfling
rogues! Got her to hug a cliff golem; should have taken a screenshot.

I'll try greatdvide next. Whats the bet i can get to kael?
