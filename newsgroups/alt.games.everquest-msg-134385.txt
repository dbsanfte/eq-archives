Weird. Let me know if anyone saw anything similar. After the first patch
was complete (roughly 4 hours ago) wife logged me in successfully
without activating new interface). Logged out. I've been trying to log
in since and can't get past the initial "trying to connect to login
server" screen. 

Yeah, could still be massively busy, but I'm hearing a lot of other non
connect problems. After the St. Valentines Day Massacre Patch, I want to
make sure they haven't disabled something from even letting my try to
log in. That one kept me offline for three days. May as well look for a
workaround now, if that's the case.
