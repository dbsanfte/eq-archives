I do this deliberately, in the many instances where someone is running unopposed
or where there are two candidates who are both replusive.  I like to imagine it
sends a message, as in "hmm, 400 people voted for A for mayor and 200 people voted
for B for mayor, however only 100 people voted for C for dog catcher even though
he was running unopposed"

More hopefully, it at least reduces the "mandate" the politician can claim, if he
doesn't get my vote.

Its interesting that in an off year election so few people show up.  In my town,
with over 10,000 voters registered, by 4pm when I voted the people manning the
polls said they'd only seen around 500 people.  5 hours to go, and some don't vote
till they get out of work... but I still bet my vote represents about 10
registered voters who didn't bother, and more like 20 adults of voting age.  Nice
to see I can have such a large effect, so you other people please vote less unless
you agree with me!
