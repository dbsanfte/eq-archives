Pretty much like the DSL thing.  I couldn't possibly maintain a written
list.  If someone pisses me off enough, he's on ignore.  There are folks I
tend to avoid (Follower of Noability...errr Nobility, Flames of Zek on Zeb)
and tend to "miss" buff requests when they ask, but I'm never rude to them.
I often "miss" requests for anyone who is anon...but then again, i often
"miss" EVERYONE's request when I'm in a crappy mood (which is usually the
case after the 2nd KEI request in as many minutes).

Ok rambling over.  I've found lists to be useless.  If you really give a
damn about not giving someone assistance in the future, put them on
ignore...the capacity is around 100 now, right?
