I've heard those stories too, and when I encoutered those mobs, I and
the team I was with found that a 5 healer rotation with a druid
patching was more than adequate ... With a properly geared tank.

without a properly geared tank, you are doing what is known as zerging,
and you might as well go home.  Further, 20 clerics in a .5 rot, is
dodgy at best, and you will run into timing issues, and you don't have
all the time in the world because there's no such thing as an infinite
mana pool.
