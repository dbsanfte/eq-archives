There was a similar guild in Fennin Ro, the Soerbaird. It's down to three 
members now (at least, until I finally catch up with the guild leader and I 
force him to take Parsifal in :)

As characters move up in levels, single-class guilds become less and less 
attractive... Fun from a roleplaying point of view, but the members will 
soon feel that they are missing out on the high-end stuff.
