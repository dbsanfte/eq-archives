Some information to share and a question on the subject Quest:

Tarre (48 DE Necro) and myself finished the Phenocryst Focus quest on
Sunday, doing it twice in a row.  Everything went according to what I'd
researched on it, in terms of the giants spawning, how to take them
down, etc. and we both got the item. (In fact, we had overkill on it.
Two full groups of low to upper fifties. The two alcolyte giants turned
out to be blue to my 48 wizard and the bloodpriest was yellow. DOH!) 

However, I had read from some posts on Alakhazams that the quest could
be done back to back with a respawn time of about ten or fifteen
minutes. We did the quest in the order specified by the mob. i.e. we
turned in the three crystals and the quest item, killed the giants,
looted the amulets, then turned them in for the reward, and waited for
Phenocryst and his buddies to come outside and build The Menhir, which
then blew up.

We went back in and waited for Phenocryst to respawn.  And waited. And
waited. Thank the gods my friends are patient. It took 45 minutes for
the crystaline bastard to respawn. Then we did it again without a hitch.

So that's the information part. Now the question.  One member of our
little raiding party suggested that maybe the way to do it faster was to
loot the amulets off the first set of giants, but before turning them in
to finish the quest, to have the second person turn their stuff in and
spawn a second set of giants. But can this be done? Will Phenocryst
accept a second set of crystals while he's "waiting" for the final
amulets? 

And even if it does work, after the first questor turns in his/her
amulets for the final reward, would Phenocryst accept a second set and
give the reward before he does his death march outside to build the
Menhir?

Even if he wouldn't, I guess this would still be a bonus for the people
doing it, since the giant killing party could be finished and leave, and
just the questors could wait around in Phenocryst's room until he
spawned again.

But have any of you actually done this and been able to speed up the
process?
