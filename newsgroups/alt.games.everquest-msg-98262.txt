*sniff* I looooved that show.  Had to fight with my brother in order to see
it.  I think I saw it in rerun's--When was it originally run anyway?
Something always made me uncomfortable about the theme song tho.  Don't know
if I really like the words.  Start playing it and I get all choked up tho.

See ya
