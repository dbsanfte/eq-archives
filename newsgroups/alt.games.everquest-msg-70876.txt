It's not that it goes poof, it's just nolonger visible to you, another
character can still see the Bag (lot of good that does you because of the
decay rate you won't have time to log another character to pick it up). This
is a little late but Items left in Ovens, Forges, Pottery Wheels ect DO NOT
Decay. I have tested this with junk Items in empty cities and left stuff in
there for hours logged off completely and check the stuff is still there. My
advice in the future go to a relatively Isolated pottery wheel and leave
your stuff there.
