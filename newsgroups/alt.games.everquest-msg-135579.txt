    Prior to the Bazaar opening, I would have suggested looking at item
lists on Allakhazam's, or I would have made suggestions on what I knew to be
good value for those slots.

    But with the Bazaar, I don't need to do any of that. Go there, do
searches on cleric gear for your race usable in those slots. Jot down the
stuff in your price range, and the stats. Min-max what you can buy based on
your budget. Odds are whatever you find will be priced cheaply if more than
one person is selling it. The Bazaar makes gear suggestions a thing of the
past - now all I can suggest are themes, like keeping HPs/AC up at lower
levels.
