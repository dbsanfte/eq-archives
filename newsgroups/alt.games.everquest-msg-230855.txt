 do the rest of you have some 'favorite spots'

I've always enjoyed the mountains that form the zone edge of Great Divide.
Way back in my early days of EQ, I only knew Greater Faydark and
Butcherblock mountains.  Friends who played longer than I did always told me
about other zones, so I set out then, and continue to this day, to explore
as much of Norrath as I can.  Seeing all the exotic things for sale on
Freeport vendors (deathfist scalps!) was fun.
