Anyone can have a Magelo Profile
(http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=137989 or
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170059) just go to
www.magelo.com and register then set it up.

If that's the Familjen (Family) from Bristlebane then they are a great bunch
of guys, my friend has joined them recently and they seem a far cry from the
bunch of l33t wannabe's we were with previously.
