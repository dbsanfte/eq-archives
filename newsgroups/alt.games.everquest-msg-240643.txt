I think the game would be better without this than with it but I find it
hard to get too upset about this one in isolation.

It's just part of a long trend of changing the nature of the game from
simulating an interesting and myseterious world into a being a series of
raid encounters with small bits of scenery between them.

Some people prefer it the way it is now. I'm not sure I do.
