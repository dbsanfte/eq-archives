You cannot have a negative number stored in a field type of byte.  Which a
byte will hold the integer numbers of 0 to 255, making 256 total numbers.
Coding is why someones WIS or whatever will be limited to 255.  Adding a
field to a binary tree data record is NOT tough (ie. a binary indicating if
CHA is beneficial to a particular class or not).
