Hehe,

Yea.  Remember the sewing kits, how wonderful leather was and plate was the
shit!  100 pp was a fortune, took a lot of skellies and bat wings to come up
with that.  The game is different, to accomodate the the different interest
and time available I guess to play.  In a way, those who have survived the
meger times may be considered the founders and probably have a great deal of
experiance others have missed out on.  I guess the game is different for
all, I still enjoy it, ignoring all the pl me request I receive as I pass.

my 2 cents
