    I can! ;-) We have one guild on my server that is made up of the core
powergamers from the guild that used to be number one through Velious. These
guys remember what it was like being top dog, and have made no bones about
how they want to be back there. If something is up, they try to kill it no
matter how few people they have and they've scored some impressive wins
(Vindi with 8 and Shei with 40 are impressive for people that never killed
Emperor or Cursed in my books). They also use all the old tricks to get
their way, like blocking a passageway in Ssra with an ogre to win a race and
using a bard to Gate Tormax when someone outraced them to him.

    Well, now that PoP is out they feel they can finally race to be first to
certain planes. And they have - first in BoT. For the trials, they would
have however many people they had there all submit their names as group
leaders on the list to get into Executioner so they could try many times.
They also did the "loot the previous corpse" thing. In PoS, they've tried
unsuccessfully to kill off all the key mobs so nobody could follow them into
BoT. When Aerin'Dar was up recently, they had casters bind inside the lair
and bind-point rush him to try and win. One friend of one of our warriors
took nine deaths that night before deciding to call it a night and /q'ing.
