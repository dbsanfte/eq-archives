Hmmmm, I'm not against most of the changes they are making at all, but you
have a point here.  Level 1-10 were some of the most exciting, due to the
high risk.  This is great if you're on your third character, but a brand new
player is missing out  on a tough but fun time when they add this.
Lower level rezzes though, no problem with that.  Corpse runs will still be
there, and if they aren't once in a while that's fine.  I made it thru those
early levels without em, but I would gladly have accepted a rez, lets say
half the times I died.  CRs are fun, but only to a point.  Half my deaths in
those early days were due to unannounced trains anyway, so it's not like I
needed to be punished!  ;)
