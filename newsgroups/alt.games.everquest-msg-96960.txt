Since hybrids are a mix of two existing classes, it would not be that
hard to add to the "lore" of Everquest.

Just add an NPC  Paladin trainer in the Gnome Cleric Guild in Ak'Anon
(sp), and bingo you have Gnome Paladins. Throw in a some back story
about the NPC trainer finding religion and giving up some of his
warrior skills in exchange for cleric skills, and you have the basis
for the new class.

Unfortunately it would be much harder to add the class/race I
personally want....Gnome Monk!!!!
