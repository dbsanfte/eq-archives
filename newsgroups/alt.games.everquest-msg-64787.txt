Are you serious? There was just a new release put out. Thousands of
people may have gotten the game brand new for the first time, or gotten
the expansion, but never saw a point in visiting a.g.e before. Now they
are having problems because the launch isn't going very smoothly so they
come here and start whinging.
*sigh*
I'm just trying to sort through all these messages and find if anybody
else is having the same problems I am and has found a fix, or trying to
read things that I've seen fixes for and add them in.

1300 new fucking messages since 6:00 pm. 
*cringe*
