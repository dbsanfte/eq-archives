Iagree with this sentiment(sp?).  When I was first introduced to the 
game, my RL friends that I gamed with talked me into making a rogue (I 
wasn't sure what class I wanted, but it was either a rogue or a 
wizard...I KNEW that much), and all but demanded he be a dwarf.  I made 
up he name Balanof because it sounded Dwarf-like to me...they laughed.  
(Well, until Ipointed out the name shey chose - can't remember them now.)  
At first, I kinda liked the rogue life, but QUICKLY grew tired of it.

When the three of us would play together, it was fine.  But when I was 
having to play the game without hem, I hated it to the point of almost 
quiting.  I went through the "make all the alts I can in different 
race/class combos" trying to find the one thing that "clicked".  Long 
story shorter?  I gave up, and decided to make a Gnome so I could do 
tinkering (the other tradeskils didn't really appeal to me).  Out of the 
ashes of "I always wanted to be a wizard, to some degree", he became one.  
And other than the occasional bad day, I have enjoyed leveling this 
little guy up.  Not as fast as some, but I'm alot farther along then any 
of my other alts ever got (39 now, and the  next highest is Balanof at 
23)!  I could be making more plat, but I'm usually having fun.  I could 
be raking in the xp, but I'm enjoying the game again.  It just goes to 
show ya that the first character you play may not be the right one.

Oh, and I make up all the names I have had (except one woodelf named 
Mixael, which is simply the "Americanized" spelling of the Greek spelling 
of Michael (ancient Greek, BTW).)  My current main is Miznit, and there 
is no hidden meaning there.  I jsut liked the sound of it :)

Miznit, 39 Wizard, E'ci
