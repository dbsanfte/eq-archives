Just think how grateful Sony's EQ Tech Support must be that such a thing 
as video drivers exist. If there were no such thing as video drivers then 
Tech Support would have to actually fix something instead of telling you 
to update your drivers. It reminds me of the old saying that goes 
something like this, "If the only tool you have is a hammer, then all 
your problems look like nails".
