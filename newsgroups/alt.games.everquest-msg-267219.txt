I think one reason there's not much chat is that a lot of people, like me, 
are new to the EQ world and are simply trying to figure out what's what and 
how things work.  Also, a lot of the early quests seem to be set up simply 
toward those ends, and don't necessitate either a lot of grouping or chat.

I expect that will change later on.

If you need to email, then chainbreaker (naturally) at comcast dot
