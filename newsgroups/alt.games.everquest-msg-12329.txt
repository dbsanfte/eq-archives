	The real Faydedar spawns as frequently as ever, and as far as I know still
paths right into the Iksar Master who kills him shortly after spawning.

	That's why you'll often see naked characters with names like "Faybait"
sitting on top of the pylons in Timorous.

	Also as far as I know, the real Fay does not drop the epic pieces any
more.  You have to go after the triggered one.
