Waitaminute here... I thought that there were 3 types of haste, which can 
stack with other hastes from other types but not from their own- Item 
haste, Spell haste(which includes some songs) and Song haste. The epic 
haste does not stack with spell *or* song haste? I was under the impression 
that Celestial Tranquility counted as Song haste.
