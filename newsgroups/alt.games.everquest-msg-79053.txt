Hehe, it uh.. makes zoning faster among other things.
:)

Actually, Umbra is a AMD thing I believe.  Some kind of on-chip graphics
processing. - However, with the new Directx 8.1 competing for major amounts
of CPU time, it kind of kills the Umbra crap. - Why this helps us without
AMD's as well, I'll never know.. because I cease to care once my load time
has increased. ;)
