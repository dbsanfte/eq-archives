/agree

If you've played one of the RTS games like AoE or Warcraft, you've played 
them all. They all amounted to racing up a technology tree and being the 
first able to send the most advanced units down upon your enemy. I've 
always wanted to give Civ a shot though. I've almost purchasd Civ III on 
more than one occasion.

I will say that LoE does seem to offer one interesting twist in that the 
various units are supposed to utilize their individual EQ abilities to 
complement one another similar to how a group might in EQ, e.g. a glamour 
caster (chanter) might mez some of the enemies while the warrior types 
gang up on the remaining ones while clerics might heal combatants and 
such. I might give this one a shot, but I'm getting sick of seeing the ad 
when trying to play EQ.
