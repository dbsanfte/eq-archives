What bothers me about this whole incident is that it's pretty clear
that Verant got annoyed that Conquest had some chance of beating the
zone with "too few people" and then started looking for exploits.
In other words, they didn't see an exploit and decide to punish Conquest,
they saw the zone being beaten and decided to look for "exploits"
so they could punish Conquest.
