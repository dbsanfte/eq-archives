Anyone else think it is stupid that your char puts on a mask and there
is no change in their appearance?  Also, it sucks that you can't tell
what an item will look like until you buy it and try it on - sometimes
how good it look s may be a factor if two items look about as good as
each other.  OK, whine over.


Also, I have a splitpaw mask (called something like that anyway) which
I haven't upgraded since I got it at lvl 5 because I found that it is
a light source, and thus incrediably handy to my Barb warrior. 
However, it doesn't say that it is a light source in the item
description - does anyone know of other masks or items I could use
which shed light (I already found my BABS is one, but I don't always
have it out).
