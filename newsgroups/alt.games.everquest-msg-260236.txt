Aye I've fought in POV, heck I've been MT in Torment for short periods
of time (MT LD).  But half the guild is 65, and wants to start doing
some progression.  What this means is that they need to get everyone
backflagged and up to speed.

What -I- would do is put a core group in place and feed them a couple 
people every 45 minutes, while allowing anyone not concerned to do 
something productive.  Even better, I'd put those people in the feeding 
chain into a Death Row group to keep path to Mavuin clear, and keep them 
exping up while at it.

But its not my guild, and its from a more family oriented angle, which 
means they aren't driven enough to set that sort of thing up, heck, they 
could barely manage to figure out what a core group might look like.

I don't mind the haphazard nature of the run so much as the not telling 
me what was going on; once they -knew- I wasn't going and they had no 
use for me, they should have up and said so instead of just watching me 
sit there for another half hour
