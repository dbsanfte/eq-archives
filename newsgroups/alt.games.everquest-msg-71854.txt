I messed with the sliders last night.  I put the bottom one all the way to 
the left ( recommended ) and the top one one notch from the right ( also 
recommended ).  It worked beautifully... until I zoned.  After that, I 
pretty much had no sound.  I went to Luclin, at Shadowhaven, and started 
walking across that thin bridge thing.  I walked to the edge to look down, 
and suddenly a LOUD screech campe out of my speakers, scaring the living 
fuck out of me, as my computer rebooted.

So, I went back in the panel and turned down the acceleration one more 
notch and I had full sound again, but lost it when I zoned.
