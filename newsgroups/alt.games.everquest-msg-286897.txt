Okay, I know everyone's up in arms over all the non-weapon procs
breaking (like SK lifetap procs, among many many others), but when
I got home today and logged in for the first time since the patch,
the first thing that struck me was that they've completely broken
windowed mode.

As you may know, under the old windowed mode there were various
specific screen resolutions you could select.  And of course you
might need to lay out your UI windows differently at different
resolutions, so the UI_name_server.ini files kept track of the
location and size of each UI element separately for each possible
resolution.

Well, apparently the new windowed mode uses some new way of figuring
out the dimensions of the EQ window, and it doesn't match ANY of the
existing resolutions in the .ini file.  The result?  If you play in
windowed mode -- which I do almost exclusively -- all the UI elements
are tossed around the window in some haphazard way.  In many cases,
users have reported that the UI elements are resized too small to use,
such as spell gem windows that only show 3-4 gems.  The problem is
worse if you use a custom UI, but even the default UI is messed up in
windowed mode.

It's pretty impressive that they can do this twice in one patch.
They make a change to how procs work, and manage not to notice that
they've broken most procs completely.  (Despite the fact that, even
in the very limited time this was on Test, the problem WAS reported.)
And they make a change to how windowed mode works, and manage not to
notice that they've broken windowed mode UI layout completely.  This
is exceptionally thorough, even for SOE.

I suppose at some point I'll sit down and painstakingly log in each
of my characters, then switch back and forth between fullscreen (so
I can remind myself where all my windows belong) and windowed (so I
can put everything back).  Fortunately many of my characters have
similar layouts so once I've fixed a few I should be able to edit
the .ini files to fix the others.  Heck, I might even be ready to
play the game again in time for Saturday's raids.

And here I thought I was paying SOE so I could play.  Little did I
know I'm paying them for the right to alpha test their code changes.
And as an added bonus I get to spend a few days reconstructing my UI.
What fun!

Bah.  I'm going to go play some other games for a while and hope that
they fix this mess before I bother spending any time trying to repair
it myself.
