As Wizzie in his 10 season of study I've started Tinkering, and thus
come to a few questions:

1:  Do I have to wait till lvl 16 till I can advance in this skill?

2:  Am I right in believing that I have a skill level of 50 right at
the start?

3:  Where can I find a good listing of what to charge for my gizmos?
     (I've done some searchs and find very few items listed with
      prices, and I don't want to under cut the market too much.)

4:  Anyone need a Fishing Pole on Vazaelle?   :)    
send tell to Brixstorm  I'm in EC a lot.

TIA
