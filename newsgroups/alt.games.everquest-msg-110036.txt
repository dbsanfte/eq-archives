I probably will, assuming they make the game they're describing.  I was 
already planning on starting Star Wars: Galaxies when it came out because 
of the similar improvements there, but I'd much rather play in Norrath than 
in space.

I do like the idea of SWG's bounty hunters, though.  Wonder how EQ2 will 
handle PvP.  In strongly -limited- form, I think it can add to the game.
