In zones like Sebilis this isn't usually a problem, where the gem drops
are plentiful.  Go to Karnor/Chardok/Howling Stones, however, and
that's not the case (then again, pickup groups don't generally happen in
HS or Chardok).

I'll use Marzin (1 peridot) on the enchanter & main tank.  I do expect
to be allowed to loot more than usual for this, and if other members
want the big symbols, I consider it pretty unfair to be expected to do
it for free.  Symbolling the whole party is roughly equivalent to
spending 1pp every minute the whole time you're grouped.

Fortunately most people are pretty understanding when you explain the
heavy cost of symbols to them.

And to the poster who said "it's only plat" - bring your own gems if
that's how you feel.
