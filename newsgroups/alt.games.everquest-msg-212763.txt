From the shadows, the mysterious jennaii@aol.comnojunk (Jennaii) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

I never really understood the reasoning behind buying RBG. If you're
going to be shelling out tens of thousands of pp on a haste item, at
least get one that gets to 30%.

RBG has been one of the most consistently overpriced items in the game
for years.

However if your upgrade was recent enough maybe the bottom has finally
dropped out of RBG price with the influx of Soulscream Belts from
Veksar.
