I was not counting the 44 and half cents per gallon of gas I buy. Even
though our govenor raids that account frequently to pay for vote buying
schemes since it produces surplus money over all that is needed for
maintenance and new road construction.

Infrastructure is what people call the products of private buisness when
they go large scale. It gets built only when goverment gets the hell out of
the way.

Security is largely a sham . None of us have much of it , that which we do
have is provided by people usually considered to be the bottom rung of our
society by those who love big goverment.

Education I am sorta soft on . I realize that my money/productivity is being
stolen to teach YOUR kids. But even so it would not annoy me if they where
taught in a competent manner. The average spent per year teaching our kids
is over 10,000 per kid per year and the result is abysmal. Completely
untrained stay at home moms, produce a teaching result significantly better
in 2/3rds the time for peanuts. When we see vouchers for every child and
school choice I will once more be willing to pay for YOUR kids, and that gun
at my head will no longer be noticed as much.
