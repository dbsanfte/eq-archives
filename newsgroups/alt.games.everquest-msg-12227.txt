invest 10 skill points in baking skill. then start with batwings and
frosting. that makes bat crunchies. when that trivials go to fish and
jug of sauces. this can be sold back to the vendor for a profit (at
least it was a week ago.....i havent cooked any since the patch and i
DO know they removed shark meat which was twice as profitable). when
that trivials go to fish and batwings to make fishrolls which is a
banquet sized meal so it lasts a lot longer. get a backpack full of
fishroll stacks and buy a lot of FuzzleCutter Formula 5000 (off of the
gnome outside the west freeport entrance) because it is an enduring
drink and sell these stacks to high levels who need catering to. the
fish filets you sell back to the vendor was netting me 20pp profit
every time i bought 15 stacks of both fish and jug of sauces. but it
is damned monotinous and boring. but hey.....it payed for all my
spells and that cute little coldain velium longsword for my warrior.
