If you choose LoIO as your home, when you hit 20, you'll begin to see just
how useful that can be.  My recommendation is to put away your zweihander,
and use bash and cease to keep things from casting (Desist takes just a
little too long to cast).  Just bashing is how I stayed alive when we
already had full pull, and then someone pulled a revenant on us.  Kept him
from casting every other time, which definatly had an effect on my hp level.
Once you hit 30, and find a good group for Lower Guk (Instrument of Nife and
a Ghoulbane make you useful even at that low level), you will be constantly
cycling between bash and cease when fighting casters, sometimes Desist, if
the casters are going wild.
