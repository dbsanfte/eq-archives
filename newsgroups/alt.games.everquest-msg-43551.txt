You want to know the really sad thing?
While ebayers have their own stigma, the people on our server who
actually *buy* high level characters have a MUCH better understanding
of the class than the majority of the folks who actually leveled these
classes.

But then when you see the type of play you often see in some of the
zones, that's not exactly very difficult to achieve...my god, I'd
forgotten the level of fuckwittedness in this game until I tried to
play my twinkie a bit recently..and these are level 50+ players.
