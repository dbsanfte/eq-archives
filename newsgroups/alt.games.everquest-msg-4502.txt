Hey GP, let me fill you in on what's going with Avenger and
the rest of the Short Bus Gang. (Which is their official name)

Most have basically KF (kill filed) them at this point. Myself
included. The others who haven't yet (But I'm sure will) have
continually put them in their place.

Their only retaliations are one liners cleverly designed by
what would seem to be 5th grader on too much Ritalin.

BTW, Welcome to the A.G.E.
