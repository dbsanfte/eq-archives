I'm starting a new rule.

No more metaphors, similes or allegories!

Nothing is like anything!

Usenet is nothing like an Inn, Camping a spawn is not like buying a car and
Ninja looting is not like eating at a restaraunt!

Arrrgggggghhhh!

Sorry. Servers down and I'm going to log into the Droga jail all alone and
surrounded by Flamedrowsers.
