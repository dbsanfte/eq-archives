Well, I play a Wood Elf and this is what I get:

[Fri Feb 01 09:20:51 2002] You say, 'what second escaped gladiator'
[Fri Feb 01 09:20:51 2002] Grahan Rothkar says 'It appears our prize
gladiator has escaped.  He is a minotaur hero!!  Trained by our best.  He
took down five of our greatest warriors during his escape.  Rumor has it he
fled to his homeland in the Steamfont Mountains.  They say he is an outcast
and does not live with his people.  He appears during times of great need to
champion the minotaurs.  Return his shackles to me and glory is yours!! '
[Fri Feb 01 09:21:10 2002] Grahan Rothkar says 'You are a true Steel
Warrior!!  Now you shall wear my hero bracers.  I designed them for my
greatest gladiators and you have shown yourself mighty enough to wear them.
'
[Fri Feb 01 09:21:10 2002] Your faction standing with Steel Warriors got
better.
[Fri Feb 01 09:21:10 2002] Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos could
not possibly get any better.
[Fri Feb 01 09:21:10 2002] Your faction standing with Corrupt Qeynos Guards
got worse.
[Fri Feb 01 09:21:10 2002] Your faction standing with The Freeport Militia
got worse.
[Fri Feb 01 09:21:10 2002] Your faction standing with Knights of Truth got
better.

I never did the cat quest at all, I just got Halas faction up doing Gnoll
teeth until I could do the Elixir quest - running around Everfrost. Took
quite a while, maybe a hundred laps or so, pretty crazy way to do it. The
Milk quest is much faster but I didn't want to take FP Militia hits.

Anyway, use the phrase 'what second escaped gladiator', rather than 'I will
find the second escaped gldiator' - especially if you typed 'gladiator'
wrong in the game :).

BTW, you need to be VERY close to Kindly con to do this. Very high amiable.
I went kindly after the second set of shackles I turned in.
