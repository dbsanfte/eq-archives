Sounds like martyrdom to me.

At that point, what have you got to lose?  The would-be hacker would
probably have already changed your password.

Incorrect.  Here's the (recently clarified) policy:
------------------------------
There appears to be some confusion regarding the second part of our
Account Security Statement. We therefore would like to take a moment
to clarify our position. 

"(2)Any and all stolen and/or compromised accounts that are reported
to SOE will be banned, and no items will be reimbursed. Any player
found to be involved in an account theft will have any and all of
his/her accounts banned."

Prior to banning any accounts reported as compromised, we will conduct
a thorough review of the accounts in question and determine the
appropriate course of action on those accounts. Accounts will only be
banned based on information gathered through our investigation and not
merely as a result of external allegations.
