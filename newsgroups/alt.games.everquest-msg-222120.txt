Consider yourself lucky.  Sorry gotta add my vent to yours...
1. Logged on my cleric and turn on LFG, get a hail from my chanter friend also
LFG.  Get a tell right away from a necro, she's got a paladin, mage and warrior
incoming, meet up with her within a minute, GREAT we are really going to roll
tonight!
4. 3 now in group, she tells us the paladin and warrior bailed.  I'm
immediately a little pissed as I had already checked the /lfg list and there
were NO tanks our level on and her friends bailed within ONE minute???  I check
my friends list, no one on yet, but it's really early.  check /lfg and see a
warrior 51, Dumby, send tell, he says yes he'll join. (I shit you not, that was
his name).  He's in EC, I let GL know he's coming.  Meanwhile the necro has a
ranger guildie that agrees to join.  Cool.  
5.  So now we are cleric 47, chanter 46, mage 46, necro 47, ranger 46, where's
the warrior?  Still in EC.  GL sends him a tell, yes, he's on the way.  We chat
while we wait about prior missions and everyone seems knowledgable.  A couple
of friends log on, but we are full group now.  Ten minutes later warrior 51
finally joins group.  (10 minutes to get from the magus in EC to the magus in
BB????)  Says he wants to MT.  Great.  Obvious twink, cool.  GL gets a *kill
the masses* mission on first try.  How can we go wrong????
6. I gate down to MM, everyone else runs down.  Dumby runs right up to the
dungeon and zones in, no buffs, the mage isn't even here yet.  We go ahead and
zone after him.  Meanwhile Dumby had zoned back out.  We tell him to come back
in, by that time the mage is here.  
7. Without a word, Dumby attacks the first mob.  No pulling back to us, no
*incoming* msg, just runs in there and starts wacking.  The thing is, he's SO
twinked that it actually works!  Well, until he starts getting adds.  There
were some pretty tense moments.  But we were at 32 of 50 mobs dead with 56
minutes left to go.
8.  Then he starts moving through rooms without clearing all the mobs and
things get just nasty.  Dumby doesn't slow down, he just keeps plowing forward
even though we are all trying to get him to at least FINISH THE MOBS IN THE
ROOM BEFORE MOVING ON.  We all have our assist set to him, and he keeps
changing mobs.  The chanter gives up on trying to mez, the other mobs in *this*
room are close enough they join in.  We both go down.
9.  We are at 40 of 50 mobs with 38 minutes to go.  I run back & rez the
chanter.  The rest of the group is discussing the situation.  The mage is
pissed and telling the warrior off.  The necro is trying to be nice about the
whole thing, advising the warrior how he could play more effectively, the
ranger sends me a tell saying he thinks maybe its time for a new puller if I
will pacify he'll give it a shot.  Meanwhile Dumby says his first words since
joining:  "I'm dumb.  You lead".  
10.  For the first time in my cleric life, I took the bull by the horns.  I
announced the *new rules*.  Ranger was pulling, I was pacifying, everyone set
your assist to the ranger.  Dumby goes and sits down next to the chanter and
does nothing from then on.  The third mob dropped a nice tank type item.  Guess
who knows how to /ran 100 and manages to win???  When the ML gave him the
shoulders he said his second words since joining, "thanks".  I wanted to slap
the shit out of him.
The ranger does a FINE job of tanking the rest of the mission and we complete
it with plenty of time to spare.  (He is my new hero and best friend and if
he's LFG he has one from now on if I'm around to join him).   
So I guess it wasn't a failure.  But I have a headache and sure don't feel like
it was a *win*.  
Ok, end of vent....
