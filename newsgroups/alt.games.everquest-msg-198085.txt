Doh!  OK, sorry about that.  Iksar blood was dropping off the various Iksar 
in LoIO.  Mostly low level types.  Rare drop though.  Got confused there by 
what others were saying.

Used to sell for 2k on EMarr when I farmed it a few times. Once to pay for 
the one I bought when I was in a hurry to get my key, and then a few more 
times to finances spells and tradeskills.  I think it's down around 200 to 
250 now.
