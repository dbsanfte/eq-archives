Nah, I just wanna pick on Rosewhite for being so easily swayed ;)

The EruX Files?

I was killed by a merchant last night. I was oom from porting and
nuking spiders and saw a lowbie fight a kodiak inside the store, so I
decided to take a couple whacks at it and back off. When I backed off,
my targeting somehow switched to the merchant behind me. SPLAT. The
whole thing was so funny I couldn't help but laugh :) (And as this was
in EC, I found a high level cleric with spare time on her hands)
This was after having outrun a blue dragoon Xytl in WC and seeing both
Thistle and the pained unicorn in L Fay, so I had quite a few unusual
run ins yesterday.
