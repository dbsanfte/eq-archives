Of the 15 classes available monks are at the present point the weakest. They
tank roughly as well as a rogue and do significantly less dammage than one.
Since rogues and warriors are also weak atm this is kinda pathetic. It is
significantly hard to find groups with one even sporting good gear. This sad
state has reduced the number of monks but not yet to the point where verant
has recognized their screwup.
