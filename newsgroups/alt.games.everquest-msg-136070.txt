When server problems happen, hundreds to thousands of people from one
or all servers drop at once. Then Verant will help those that are
inconvienenced. If it's just you, then guess what: it ain't the
server. Remember, there are many links and routers between your
computer and the Everquest servers. Just because all your other
internet applications were working except EQ does not make it Verant's
fault that you dropped connection. And if this is the case, then they
won't help you.
