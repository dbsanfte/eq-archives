In the world of MMOG's, though, nothing succedes like success.  You go 
where the fellow gamers are, for the most part.

This same phenomenum accounts for the popularity of the IBM platform, of 
Windows, of AD&D, of VHS... all in many ways inferior to their 
competition, but they took the majority market share and so people flock 
to them.

If I were considering playing an MMOG at this point, I'd probably look 
first at WOW.  Any friends I have that play are most likely playing 
that, anyone I meet in the future who plays is most likely playing that, 
  its what I hear about in the mainstream media... and its least likely 
to die out from under me.

As an experienced gamer, I'd look at a lot of other factors, and might 
well go another way (well, actually I have gone another way, back to EQ) 
but if there are really 7M people playing WOW, most of those people 
never played any other MMOG before that, because even at its peak EQ 
never touched that number, and Lineage players are almost all still 
Lineage players.
