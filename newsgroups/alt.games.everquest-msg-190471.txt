How exactly does one go about power leveling a character? I now have a
2 machine network set up at home and am going to be getting a second
EQ account. Since I spend most of my time soloing, I'm thinking of
creating a cleric for emergency assistance, but will need to get this
cleric up near the level of my current character (25) so that they can
at least work together. I'd like to use my level 25 Paladin to power
level my cleric, but how do I do this? They can't group together or
the cleric won't get XP, right? And if they don't group how do people
move them around together? I'd like to have one Follow the other, but
don't you have to be grouped to do this? Sorry if these aer stupid
questions but this aspect of the game is all new to me.
