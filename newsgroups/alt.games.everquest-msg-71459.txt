Anyplace in Luclan (ok, in Shadeweavers - my 9 shaman cat hasn't gone
elsewhere) when fighting in a group.  5fps?  How about 1spf - and I am
not talking about sunscreen!  4 PCs, 3 pets, and 5 mobs.  Useless. 
Framerates in Kunark get pretty bad also.

This is the biggest issue I have with the game, and I really wish VI
would make an announcement on what they are doing about it.  Two weeks
of silence makes me wonder if they ever plan on doing anything about
it.  Patch after patch of cosmetic and non-essential fixes.  Is this
as "good" as we can ever expect?  VI, please stop rearranging the deck
chairs long enough to at least let us know that you are aware of the
iceburg.
