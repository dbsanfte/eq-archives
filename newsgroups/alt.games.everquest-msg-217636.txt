I'd personally LOVE to see them go to a Star Wars Galaxies style of
character modelling... that was ONE thing SOE did right... You could
REALLY get a variety of folkx... I had 1 human that looked exactly
like Samuel L Jackson, and one that looked like Bruce Li. And the Sam
L was about 6'5", and the Bruce was under 5'... And I also had one
that looked a little like John Goodman! LOL!
