I've never really been one to post OT, especially in this group, but this
one just warrants comment for me.

Remember Sarah Brady, the gun-control witch who figures that all firearms
should be banned from civilian ownership in direct violation of the 2nd
Amendment?

Well, guess what she got for her son as a gift.....

This one was just too much for me, though I always suspected she was a bit
of a hypocrite. I'll bet the NRA is having a royal hoot over this one.

The link comes from http://www.metafilter.com , one of the best weblogs out
there.


Sorry again for OT'ing.
