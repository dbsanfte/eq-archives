My lvl 31 Human Warrior is KOS on the BB docks with one of the towns
people.  Some of the guards are dubious, but not all.  Some regard me
threateningly.

I tryed killing goblins and that helped with most guard faction, but
not this one guy on the docks.

Rallo Zek diety is the reason and I'm assuming that's what happened to
you.  I didn't find out until my 3rd time going to the docks so I must
have not aggroed that one townsperson until then.

When I gate to BB i have to run through the woods and swim around the
brick wall to get to the docks.  You can do this, but watch out for
aqua goblins.
