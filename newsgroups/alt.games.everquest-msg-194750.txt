Just about everyone agreas that you should get RUN 3 right off the bat, and
then wait untill 58 - 60 ( depending on Class) to start saving for AA's.
Remember that you will gain AA's faster at 60 than at 51. it takes the same
omount of XP to get 1 aa as it will take youto get from 50 to 51. Also above
60 you start having mobs green out to you faster, at 65 you wount be able to
fight many pre pop thins for XP, and most of those that you will beable to
will still require a raid.

AS for the XP per level, I haven't seen a new one since they "smoothed out"
51 - 60,  They said it is the same amount from 50 - 60, just without the
hell levels.
