I have been soloing and getting pick-ups in ec and wc and would like to move
to an area that will get me a little more exp. I don't mind moving away from
soloing and relying more on grouping. My only issue is bind points. I don't
really want to have to beg for ports or make a 8 zone corpse run. Thank you
for any information.

Mystowl 15th season Warrior. Quellious.
