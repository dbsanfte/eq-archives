Heck, except for the ram you mention I'd *need* to upgrade my machine to hit
those specs (particularly the graphics card).  You'll be fine with that
setup.

One thing, though ... Verant packs *everything* into the EQ directory
(folder ... whatever Microsoft's calling it this week).  That's great from
the aspect of not having registry issues to deal with, but it makes the EQ
directory pretty big ... mine is currently at 881 meg.  Didn't see any
mention of storage space in your specs, but you might want to check it out.
