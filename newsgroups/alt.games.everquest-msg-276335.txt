As long as there's money to be made someone will be there to make it.
As to what Vanguard will do, it's not up to them as someone pointed
out.  However, given the crew's past success MS would be wise to
follow their advice.

But the bigger question of buying gear v. getting it in game; really,
who cares?

So what if that guy over there bought all his uber gear?  If he sucks
he sucks and no one will want to group with him.  He'll be standing
over there in his uber gear with this thumb up .....

If he doesn't suck then he's a great asset to me as a group member,
yay me.

And if I know there's a great piece of gear I would love to have for
whatever reason but it would take a week of my life to get it in game,
why in hell would I not use real money that only took a few hours of
my life instead?  The point of the game is to enjoy your stay in the
immersive world that is MMORPG.  Of course if how someone else got
their gear is a primary concern of yours, well, everyone has a cross
to bear I guess.  You are also likely the type who is pissed off
whenever someone wins the Lotto.
