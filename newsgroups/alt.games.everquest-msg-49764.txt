Yeah I have a P3. I don't know why but the thing I'm looking forward to most
about Luclin is that you get horses! The only good thing about UO that I
miss with EQ. I heard you get them with DAoC but if course that's me out
till I get a more powerful card. I only managed to get my V3 because it was
on sale at $100 last year. Everything else is so damned expensve. Can anyone
make any good recommendations?
