    On my server, two of the four guilds in Qvic (there's two more that are
in Kod'Taz, not Qvic) have got wise to the costs associated with armour that
takes a 10500 pp reagent to make. My guild and one other sell Velium Gemmed
weapons made from raid drops. In addition, one person who four boxes Kod'Taz
and is a blacksmith also makes weapons and sells raw materials, which other
smaller tradeskillers use to make weapons for sale. Net result? An absolute
ton of weapons. I currently have, on my trader, 10 each (less today's sales)
of the piercer, 1HB, 1HS, 2HS, 2HB, and H2H weapons. Prices range from 11 K
to 7 K for the H2H. These are the only prices at which I can sell the
weapons, as everyone else is down around 11 K as well. I'm closing in on one
million pp worth of cash to the guild for the past three weeks of sales, yet
even with all this selling, we get raw materials faster than we sell
weapons - and we're just one guild.

    Most servers with higher prices have cartels or have a large number of
Kod'Taz+ guilds that just don't know what this stuff makes. I've posted
about it on EQTraders, but I was told I was an arrogant uberguilder that
only wanted drop rates lowered to raise my profits which were bled from the
poor casual player. An XP group can get the materials for one weapon every
hour on average, doing XP anywhere in Kod'Taz or higher, and with the low
trivial have about a 7 in 8 chance of getting a weapon from them. But
there's no oversupply, I should STFU, and could they please unnerf the
Windblade drop rate while they're at it?

    James
