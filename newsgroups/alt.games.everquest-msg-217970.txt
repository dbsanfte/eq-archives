There are two ways to get a BoT or HoH flag.  One is to kill a big ass 
mob with a raid.  The other is a quest that requires collecting up a 
bunch of items.  For BoT, this includes killing named giants that usually 
require 2 to 3 groups to kill, assuming close to level 65, and average 
equipment.  Not sure off hand what the alternate quest is for HoH.

I've always heard getting into VT just plain sucks.
