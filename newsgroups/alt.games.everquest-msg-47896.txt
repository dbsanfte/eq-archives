Well, if you want to be an ignorant asshole, sure he spoiled it.  The
original poster responded to the first flame explaining that he
upgraded his computer and can't find his original CD.  He also
explained that he was aware of the fact that he can't play without an
account.  
We could give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume that your news
server is just broken, or we could treat you like you treat anyone
else and call you a fucking flaming moron.  Sometimes it is better to
say nothing and be thought an idiot than to speak and remove all
doubt.
