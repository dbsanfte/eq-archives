No, but you don't need 'em.

For instance, you can put Excel Spreadsheets on your PocketPC (a great
way to have your spell lists handy).  I had synched all of EQ Atlas to
my PocketPC as well.   Get a program from Nyditot that allows you to
run the screen in different resolutions and you have a handy-dandy
pocket atlas everwhere you go.  (Um, there are some reg hacks that
will set up your IE offline storage on the Jornada to your storage
card).

Although Access itself isn't on the PocketPC, there are many free and
cheap programs that will run .mdb files from Access.  I had a bunch of
homebuilt .mdbs on my PocketPC as well.

Oh - and find MameCE or Mameboy for the PocketPC as well.  A rousing
game of Galaga or Donkey Kong is just the thing when medding up from
OOM.

Then I got laid off and sold the PocketPC.  *sigh*
