It's not "necessary", but it's there and almost ubiquitous now, and an
improvement to the arsenal. Once upon a time, people fought wars with
muzzle loading rifles that took a skilled man more than thirty seconds
to reload and only fired a single shot at a time. Later, bolt action
spring loaded clips were introduced with various methods of quickly
ejecting spent cartridges and inserting fresh rounds into the chamber.
If you held on to the muzzle loader, you were dead.

Think about it. ;-)
