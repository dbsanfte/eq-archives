It may not seem like much until you multiply it by, say, 300,000
accounts.  That gives us $3.6 million, which is half again the
development budget for Dark Age of Camelot.  That should cover quite a
lot of zone revamping, even taking into account that DAoC was a much
smaller operation.

They did this in Omens of War, for the new epics.  I'm not sure how it
worked out, since I've never been anywhere near that level of the
game, but it does sound like a good idea.
