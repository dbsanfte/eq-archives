That's the best tradeskill suggestion I've heard for ages. It would probably
ensure over time that there would be fewer weaponsmiths than provisioners,
fewer carpenters than alchemists. It never occurred to me before that one of
the biggest obstacles to a functioning economy is the inability to start a
new business under impression of the current market situation and the game
mechanics.

You should be able to rewind your career to lvl 9 or 19, depending on
whether you wanted to switch to another class altogether or just another
subclass.

Get a job at SoE, Graeme :-)
