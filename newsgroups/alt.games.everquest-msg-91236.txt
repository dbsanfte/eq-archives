Rogue most damage if able to backstab, Monk in between rogue and warrior,
then warrior/ranger are about the same, then knights SK/pally are 75% of
warrior/ranger - this is according to Verant.

You know, rogue and monk are much better than rangers at tanking.  If they
were not then monks would really suck at soloing compared to a ranger but
they do not.

Monks have 252 defense, 230 dodge, 230 block, 225 riposte
Rogues have 252 defense, 210 dodge, 230 parry, 225 riposte
Ranger has 220 defense, 170 dodge, 220 parry, 185 riposte
