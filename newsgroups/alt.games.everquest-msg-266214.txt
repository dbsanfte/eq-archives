First of all, it wasn't simply disregarded. Moving the status to
"resolved" doesn't mean it's been disregarded. It simply means that
the specific case is resolved. They can't exactly solve the case for
him if he's no longer a customer.

Second of all, you're lumping 2 separate CS interactions into one. The
statement that KSing didn't exist came from an in-game petition. The
case ticket being changed to "resolved" status came from an email he
sent AFTER he canceled his account.
