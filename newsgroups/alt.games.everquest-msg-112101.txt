I think perhaps the complaints were misread. Communications and grouping
(particularly finding a pickup group) were the major issues. Increasing
the language learning rate (even just quadrupling it) would have been enough
as a remedy for the language problem, and removing the good/evil grouping
restrictions and perhaps allowing the roleplay tag to be turned off
(but defaulting to on), or turning it off if LFG is on, would have mostly
fixed the grouping difficulties.

Allowing more than 1 character will make FV a twink server like all (?) other
servers. Removing the 1 character limit is a mistake. (Serial twinking is
possible, just buy gems or whatever and stick them in a public trade
skills container, delete and start a new character in the same city,
go grab the loot.)

For whatever it's worth, I have a 11 human necro on FV in freeport, made
after deleting a 12 halfling warrior who was having trouble finding groups.
The level 11 necro has *never* been able to group. (He has 120pp in the
bank from skins/silks, and can't find anything to buy except spells.)
