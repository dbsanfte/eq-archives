I started this link a while back and never solved my problem

When you buy the retail version of LDoN in the US you receive a rune
keychain inside the box that has rune symbols on it. You can go to the web
site and enter in runes once you figure it out. However i could never get
mine to work

I was simply asking if it was worth my time to keep fiddling with it

So in a sense it is a quest but a quest outside the game not in it
