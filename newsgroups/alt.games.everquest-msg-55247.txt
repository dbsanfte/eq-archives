Hate to contradict you, bizbee, but the rules don't agree with what
you are saying here.  I'm looking at them right now, and all they say
on the subject is: 

"Note: Non-words like-- D, Da, De, Di, El, Z, Za, Ze, Zi, L, Le, La,
Li are unacceptable in cases where the name contains a normal word, as
they are references to "The" and implicate a title, in both cases
(e.g. D`Kval is acceptable and D`Basher is not)."

Clearly there are many cases where d' and all of its derivatives would
be quite appropriate.  It's not as cut and dried as you make it out to
be.
