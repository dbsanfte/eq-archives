First this will be a good addition when all the bugs are worked out and for
now there are too many to be playable.
Second, the character models are excellent but at least on my characters
most of the armor does not show up, does anybody have a solution to this
problem.
It is stilly way too choppy to be playable at least on my machine.
The black box problem needs to be fixed very quickly as it is causing all
kinds of trouble
the chat windows seem to have problems as well and will have to be fixed.

All in all while not yet a total disaster the game is not yet playable and
is going to take a great deal of work to make it so.  I suspect they should
have done much more testing and released it later if need be for as of now
they are suffering an enormous black eye.

Also there seems to be a problem with frequent crashes and I have yet to be
able to modify my old characters appearance which may be due to the fact
that eq crashed when I initially tried to enter the character select screen.
