Since you've provided me some decent advice further up, I'm not going to
harp on too much about this, but I think it's worth bearing in mind that at
the start of this thread I wasn't actually asking for help.  I appreciate
what you've said and that you've taken the time to suggest it, and I'll go
with your advice - but let's not get to thinking that I came here, hat in
hand, begging for someone to rescue me.  Like I said, I was (and am) quite
happy to sit around taking the mickey out of myself for my poor EQ skills -
it is, after all, just a game, and a game which I rather enjoy playing,
whether I'm casual Norrath tourist or committed powerleveller.  In fact,
initially I was just amused by the notion that 3,500 pp is 'low budget' -
that's all my comment was about.

And as to whether everyone here hates me or not, you'll forgive me if I
don't lose sleep over it.  It's hardly something I can do much about whether
that's the case or not.  It might also be worth pointing out I haven't
'refused' to answer questions for anyone except a single poster whose
opinion I wasn't really interested in by that stage.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
