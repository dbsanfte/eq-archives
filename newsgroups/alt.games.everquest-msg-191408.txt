I've been playing around with a frog warrior for the past couple
days (I know, its not  a well built warrior race, but heck, its
just a toy; I've never played a frog, I've never played a
warrior) and I seem to recall some snare weapons in the hands of
warriors.

Preferably something relatively inexpensive that procs reasonably
often, damage not really an issue given that I can get rid of it
once its procced...

In fact, plan is to weild it primary, something else secondary,
and swap on the fly once proc lands... unless there's some reason
that would be upidstay.

Don't point me in the direction of Lucy, which my browser has
always refused to display, or even Allakhazam, which seems to
have stopped cooperating since my return to an internet
connection.

Thanks
