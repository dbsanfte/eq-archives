As MT I almost always have PA on tough fights so I don't have to switch
weapons. 3 min recast, 6 min duration I believe, meaning it's cast at
the start of a fight, and they don't have to cast it again for 3 mins.
Long as it's memmed and they aren't chain malo/slowing from the start,
I've never had a problem getting a PA when asked. Rangers benefit highly
from it during trueshot also.

(shows his noobism) Didn't know about the see-invis nerf. That was a bad
decision IMO, when they knew the tension that already existed. Why make
things tougher rather than leave well enough alone. Can't se any reason
to *force* people to spend even more time in there when they know the
problems accociated with the whole situation.

If you're going regularly for primals, stick a permacamped CoH mage down
there and an evacer.
