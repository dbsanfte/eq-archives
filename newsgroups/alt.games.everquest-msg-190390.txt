    Well, priorities are another issue, I was asking what people thought of
the actual idea, not what they guessed sony's priorities to be.

    Why are you against the formation of this evil big brother nightmare?
Are you happy that clueless idiots can buy 100k and solo a warrior to 40
then get a series of groups killed because they don't have any points in
taunt? I think its important to stamp that sort of thing out, and I know it
annoys me to think that the value of the effort I went to honestly gain my
plat is diminished by the fact that cheats are getting away with it to the
point where it seems like the practise is condoned.

James
