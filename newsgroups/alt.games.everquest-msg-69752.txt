As asoon as they decide to bring EQ up again, I'll move to Oasis, then. I
was there with a group not long ago and got good exp, just didn't think
about it, soloing. I hate those SG. Can I do crocs at my lvl? Been to the
Karanas and someone said kiting the elephants was good exp, too. A centaur
nearly killed me when some jerk purposely trained it onto me while I was
medding... I did the bandit camp while grouped, that was ok as well. Hmm,
haven't tried them in several lvls, maybe will go back there and kick some
bandit butt.

thanks!
