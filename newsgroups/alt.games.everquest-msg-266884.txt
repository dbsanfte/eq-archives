    One thing I may not miss about EQ will be the apparent inability of many
of this newsgroup's members to form a logical argument without resorting to
flaming and ridicule.

    As put in a previous post, that approach is perfectly appropriate for
products that are bought once and consumed, but MMORPGs have as much in
common with other regular-pay services as they do with conventional computer
games. They are a new kind of product, incorporating some elements of
product and some of service, and their potential lifespan is open to debate.

    Another viewpoint (are these allowed?) is that part of playing a MMORPG
is making an investment in your character, or characters. What Sony has done
has devalued these, like a bank that loses your savings.

    What do you feel I should have done? Or was this paragraph sarcasm so
pure that it actually has no meaning?

    There's an awfully big difference between no longer the leader, and
dead, of course.

    But MMORPGs are not conventional computer games. They undergo continual
development. How many advances did newer games bring that EQ didn't
eventually incorporate? You're slapping static product philosophy over a new
kind of dynamic product/service.
