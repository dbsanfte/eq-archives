Commonly called the PooR expansion, this adds mostly buggy content that can 
drop anquish level loot for mm geared noobs.

It contains new traps and traps affects that change existing instantances 
like 
Uqua and Inktu'ta so old strategies become redundent.

It has new spell effects called auras, but not for every class. So if you're 
hybrid is 
not a unicorn riding pansy don't hold your breath.

It pretty much finishes off the old default ui, that everybody I have spoken 
to uses.

It nerfed into oblivion the old monster missions and added some new PooR 
mm's that may 
possibly yield more xp.

Increased server stability, well bertox has been up and down like a yoyo.

Oh and if you are really lucky you get to experience the KNOWN bug which 
is losing your corpse.
This is where you can die in an instance and never get your corpse back, 
you get to experience 
the lovely delight of waiting for a gm for 2 days, as they trawl through 
the list of everybody else 
that has lost this corpse.

So in summary, you need to judge when that golden spot is,  after the stability 
is improved 
and before they swing the nerf bat.

And yes I am bitter and twisted, just like my character.
