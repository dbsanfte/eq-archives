The Rathe has a respected planar calendar as well at
http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency

Here's some info:

The Rathe and E'Ci split to Zeb.  Rathe was calendar (which people bitched
about constantly) and E'Ci is mostly public raids.

Zeb is very guild-oriented with no calendar (every time you bring up the
idea it's vehemently shouted down).  Darren's post is a bit strong for our
server but it's pretty close...if you announce your raid you have a chance
of losing it due to certain people who enjoy purposely fucking up people's
days.  LORDs did this recently to LOM.

Good news is that LORDs were flamed up & down on our official guild board
and lost a number of members because a lot of people didn't want to be
associated with them, and others refused to have anything to do with them.

(vgn boards suck big hairy donkey balls)

---
Fast forward a little, now we're hearing from The Rathe that, since the
split, no one is bitching about the calendar anymore...it's working.
Granted, I'm not on The Rathe anymore so I don't bother reading their boards
so I can't (or won't) confirm this.
