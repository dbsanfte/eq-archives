That's what I used to think. In my younger days, I hunted elementals with
all three of my characters that made it past twenty. Seems like every so
often I'd keep running across lava rocks, drops of mercury, and all those
dye components. Of course, not having done any smithing, I had no clue what
they were for and sold them to the merchants or destroyed them.
  Now, I'd cut off several toes for a stack or two, and of course I can't
find them at all.
(Last night: in excess of fifty fire elementals killed.  Total take of lava
rocks: zero)
/em sighs, clearly disappointed.
