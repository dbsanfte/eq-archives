Well, you have to remember that the purpose of this summit
meeting was to discuss the debacle of the botched GoD
release and the forthcoming OoW, both of which are uber-
high end expansions. So it stands to reason that the people
they invited to the party as it were, would be the high-end
raiding guilds. The list was a response to what was talked
about before lunch which was mainly Time/GoD related
(with exceptions like Woody of GuComics stopping them
in their tracks and saying "sorry to interrupt, but none of
this relates to me in my situation" (paraphrasing)) So it
doesn't surprise me that the fixes on there relate to that
content. Again, they even said as much themselves, but
people seem to want to believe the worst for some reason.
Hey I'd have liked to have seen something that related to
the midlevel... but I'm not going to get mad over a piece
of paper that's basically a letter to someone else.

In terms of them caring about "us", they actually explicitly
acknowledged the fact that the majority of their player
base was in the 30-50 range, and that they would have
to have these summits on something like a 6 monthly basis,
so its not even as if this charge of them being blinded by
the needs of high-end guilds really sticks, you know? I
know a lot of people are saying "I'll believe it when I see
it" and that's fair enough, but in the mean time SOE are
listening now to our feedback... if people don't suggest
anything in that time, if they start to believe months down
the line when SOE are no longer listening because all they
were hearing is bashing, what an opportunity wasted.

I mean, the players have basically started a revolution
here, and that's a great thing, which couldn't have been done
without a lot of noise, a lot of action. There is a time in
any revolution where you have to take a step back and
start talking again, it's not about pummelling SOE into
the ground because we have the opportunity, it's about
doing what you have to to get what you want, and right
now that is talking, not fighting.
