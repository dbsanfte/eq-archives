Include me in the "glad it's gone" column.

The spellbook is just horrible.  It's like...buying a Ferarri
and not being allowed to drive it.  Just sit in it.  And while
you're in it, you can't even pretend you're driving or enjoy
the dashboard and console.  You just have to stare at a picture.
The same picture.  For a few years.

Yech.  Good riddance, spellbook!

P.S. I did a quick, informal poll of some fellow guildies.
Not highly scientific; take it with a grain of salt.

Out of 18 responses: 1 thought getting rid of the spellbook
while medding is a bad idea.  3 weren't sure.  14 thought it
was a good idea.

The 1 who thought it was a bad idea is a high level tank.
Tee-hee.
