The thing about Gornit is that he's a resistant assed bastard, I had trouble
soloing him at 40 as a druid with above average gear, he'd resist about 75%
of my roots (mana free though,so not that big a deal, just annoying as hell)
and without Ro's fiery sundering he resisted about 40% of my Immolates
(don't even ask about nuking him) and since I can't debuff MR, he resisted
maybe 25% of my Drones of doom (cast, since I'm too low to use my ES arms),
at least he didn't take so long that ensnare wore off though.

Needless to say, it took a LONG time to kill the bastage (as in about 8
minutes) and then med til he spawned again only got me up to 4 bubbles of
mana, so I had to wait with him sitting there to engage again, and keep
getting worried one of the seafurby hunters would gank him.

Oh, not to mention that he kept dropping gimp ass loot (3pp!!  w00t!).

Anyway, I've found that the highest end animals in Stonebrunt (Mature/Elder
pandas especially) have about a 25% chance of dropping a very nice gem, I've
gotten black pearls, fire opals and star rubies off of them.
