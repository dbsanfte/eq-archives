And *none* of that is because the game was new to you then?  How big do you
think the world would feel now if you had never played the game and someone
explained how to get from your starting city, to the dungeon in LGuk via
SRo for an LDoN?

Nostalgia is great, when it remains that way.  Looking at something now and
saying 'i wish it was how it was when i started' is futile, because YOU
have changed, not just the game.
