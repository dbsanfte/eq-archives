On a certain level I think they can understand all of the above.  I'll give
further detail.

> Drivers Education  -- you have to be a certain age to be able to drive.
Once you reach that age you take a class, take a couple of tests, and if you
do well you get your license

> Sex Education

Moms and Dad together make babies (or sperm and egg if you prefer) and then
the baby grows inside a special place in mom's body and comes out when its
ready to

> Drug Abuse Counseling

There are some things that some people take that do bad things to your body.
Sometimes these things can make you feel kinda fun for a while so some
people like to take them, but they can really hurt you so you shouldn't take
them.  These things are different than the medicines the Dr or mom or dad
give you when you're sick.

> Heavy Machinery Operation

Those machines are really big and you have to be big in size and learn a lot
about them before you use them

> Infantry Tactics

sometimes armies have to go in to stop people who are doing bad things. It's
not a game or funny to shoot at people or play with swords or guns.

> Cancer
Sometimes people get sick. Sometimes it's just a little sick like when you
get a cold.  Sometimes its really really sick and you need to see special
doctors and take special medication to help you

> Death
It's sad when people can't be with us anymore, but sometimes it happens.
They might be old and their bodies get tired out.  They might get really
sick and can't fight the germs.  They might get in an accident and get hurt
too badly for their bodies to fix it.  It's really sad, but sometimes it
happens.


> Preparing Taxes

IN this country everybody helps out with some things, like roads or the
police or fire fighters, or even helping people who don't have enough money
to get food.  The way we do this is by giving part of the money we make to a
special group of people who spread this money out among all these other
people.  They way that they keep track of this is through something called
taxes and tax forms.

> How To Purchase A Home

You have to have some money set aside and then you make arrangements with a
bank for them to give you the rest and then you pay them back a little at a
time over a lot of years.  After you find a house you like, you and the
people who have it now talk about how much it will cost you, and when you'll
be able to move in.  Then you and the other people and the bank sign some
papers that say all the things you talked about.

All these are ideas which can be quite complex in their entirety.  They can
also be broken down into a much simpler form for young children to
understand.  As they get older and ask more details, you provide more
details.
