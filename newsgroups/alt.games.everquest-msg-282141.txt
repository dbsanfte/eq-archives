Although that would be a solution, its not necessary to waste that much 
time.

The OP says we don't "all" have stones yet.  Well, (besides the obvious 
solution, get everyone else their stones, five minutes risk free work 
which will save each person more than five minutes travel time the first 
day they have em) all that would be necessary would be for one of the 
people who -do- have their stone to use the magus to check the second camp.

I recall a great many people I did LDoN's with in pickup groups being 
unaware of this, but there's no need for everyone to go running to a 
magus camp each time you want to do an LDoN, only the guy actually 
pulling the mission has to go, as long as you are all grouped when he 
pulls the mission, you're good to go regardless of which zone you happen 
to be in when he does.

Make your leader someone who is bound at the magus camp, and he can gate 
right to it to pull that next mission as soon as you are ready, while 
everyone else heals up, meds up, replaces buffs, takes a "bio break" or 
whatever.

I never did any missions quickly enough to butt up against this 45 
minute wall, so I didn't test the question of whether you can get around 
that by pulling a mission from a different camp instead...
