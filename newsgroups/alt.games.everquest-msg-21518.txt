Any Unix or VMS shell account... I was paying 12 bucks a month for 4
hours a day on a shell account in 1994.  I had access to a VMS Shell
account back in 90 through my Sophmore(HS) Trig Teacher who also taught
at a local College.  Usenet was not just pine... in fact I've always
hated pine.  I Usta browse Yahoo etc using Lynx over a 2400 modem.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
