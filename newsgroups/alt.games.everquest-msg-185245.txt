She will attack without being provoked. It happened one time to my shaman
character.  I managed to run out of her aggro range, but when I went back
she aggro'd again.  She's kind of strange in the way she works.  It's been
quite a while, but I was pretty mad and I medded up and went back to kill
her and I almost had her dead and she gated or something.  Then I went back
a third time and she didn't aggro at all.
