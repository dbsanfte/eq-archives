My young wizard and mage use the projectile bolt spells to pull.
Sometimes I can cast it 3 times before the critter even reaches me.
But 3 times I have seen this happen:  one nuke hits twice... i.e.
double damage  for just one cast of the spell!

I took a screenshot and it went like:

You are enveloped by flame (from casting fire shield)
You begin casting Flame Bolt.
You begin casting Flame Bolt.
critter was hit by non-melee for 47 points of damage.
critter was hit by non-melee for 47 points of damage.
Critter is bathed in fire.
critter was hit by non-melee for 47 points of damage.
Critter is bathed in fire.
You begin casting Flame Bolt.

Anyway, is this just some random bug or is there some trick to making
the bolt hit twice in a consistent manner?   :) 

 When I first noticed this, my wizard was attacking a yellow con wisp
in Misty Thicket, so out of nervousness I cast and ran backwards while
the bolt was reaching its target.  This also worked on the next wasp I
tried it on.  That was a month ago.  Yesterday I was playing my mage,
and same doubled nuke behavior happened.
