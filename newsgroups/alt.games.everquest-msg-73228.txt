    In a raid environment or in XP grinds? In XP grinds nukes are just awful
and pets are fair. Remember, pets have been nerfed to the point that a melee
outdamages them quite well - I liked how the person in Verite who PLed his
Vah Shir warrior to 60 called them "a nice DoT". Check Graffe's for some of
the most recent mage logs - the mage had to make some VERY fishy assumptions
about the pet nuke, and slant conditions entirely in his favour (like having
the shaman Mal-line every pull) to MATCH the damage output of the tanks.

    In a raid environment nukes are good to poor (depending on resists and
what stage you're at), and pets are a bad joke.

    Group Clarity at level 53, group C2 at level 59. If all the enchanter
has to do is click their snake staff and cast one group buff, one would
suffice.

    Yes, you're a gimp, too. If anything, you have the exact same problem as
the INT-casters: you're capable of one big splurt of damage with Trueshot,
and in the interim do cruddy Ranger damage. The one way in which you differ
strongly from the INT caster that's LFG at zone is that people have
delusions that you can do something (tank) for which you aren't really
designed, and people malign you when you can't do it.

    Heh. The wizard, unless he's level 60 and casting one of two special
quest spells that are usable on a handful of mobs in the entire game, would
be PASTE long before he could log "15K damage in seconds". And even with
those two spells, he isn't exactly chain-casting as fast as possible. And
the wizard doesn't have the aggro control tools you have at your disposal,
either.

    His point is that his monk is a BETTER soloist than his other characters
in the same zone.
