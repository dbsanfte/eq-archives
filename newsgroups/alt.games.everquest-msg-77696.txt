That's still not gonna work very well.  You're trading 8 players (8
times the lag, 8 times the loot headaches, 8 times the odds of someone
AFKing at the worst possible time, etc...) for one complete heal
caster.

Might be worth it to just powerlevel one of those druids who
"volunteer" to switch to a cleric.
