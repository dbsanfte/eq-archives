I don't understand "undeservedly". EQ2 is a newer game and deserves
those players as much as EQ1 does.

Mmorpgs have finite life spans. There will come a time when no
resources are devoted to EQ2 either. Or WoW. I am impressed that EQ
stayed as popular as it did for as long as it did. I don't think
anyone believed it would hold on in the face of so many competing
later mmorpgs. But it did. But it can't last forever, nor was it
intended to.

I'm curious what brought this on, though, since EQLive isn't actually
dead yet. You are seeing a much reduced player population right now
then?
