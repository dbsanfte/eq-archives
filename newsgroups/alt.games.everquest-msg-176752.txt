OK, I've just seen the time it takes to get everything back together after
a wipe - and always thought that if they had just got out before messy
death it would save a lot of time on the recovery and re-stablishment of
the raid.....and this seemed to be a really nice clicky effect that would
be handy to have - if only on the cleric group to speed up reset - without
dragging out spells into the gems. If not then its still useful for
groups.
