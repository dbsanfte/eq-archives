BTW, i am not suggesting that all out assualt is the only way to resolve
this.  We list it as the only option we have to the countries harboring whom
ever happens to be responsible.  They can had over each and every peson even
remotely involved and they avoid it.  If they dont, then obviously it is
sanctioned by the government and the people of that country so they bring
down the worlds worst nightmare upon themselves.

I dont personally believe at this juncture that there are many countries in
the world that will support the groups responsible for this.  There may be
MANY groups who do, but i dont think many governments are willing to go that
far...even the dictatorships of the world arent that foolish.  They may call
for a stop, but they wont support the group(s) responsible.
