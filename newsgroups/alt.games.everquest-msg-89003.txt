I was doing this tonight.  34 necro and 32 druid in Dawnshroud Peaks.  I
blew
off the pet and we went to root DoTting.  Nothing came close to us and it
was
almost constant pulls.  He got low on mana, I filled him up.  Didn't even
need his
heals since I was using a leach for a DoT.  Couple hours of this got me 1
bubble
short of 35.  Got that after the druid left.  I commented to him that a
combo like
that should be against the rules because it's so easy.
