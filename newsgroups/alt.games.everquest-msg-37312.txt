Just checked with everlore all servers were up but with one person on them.
This is starting to look a lot like the mess that came right after the last
patch.  The truth is the only thing more frightening than Verant trying to
put in a new zone is for them to try to fix a bug or do an emergency patch
and it looks in this case like they have tried all three.  It is going to be
a fun holiday folks.
