I finally decided it was time for Slickriptide to
venture to Guk and try to get a Mask of Deception. Spent
a couple of days wandering the halls of Upper Guk,
exploring and looting leftover corpses while waiting for
a chance to camp the mask. Finally gave it up (after
coming a hair's-breadth from being killed by an undead
Froglok that appeared from nowhere at the zone border)
and headed home.

I'd picked up this funny mancatcher-sort-of weapon with
a bunch of resists on it and decided to check the price.
"PC on Runed Bone Fork!"
"1000pp!"
Uh, excuse me?

Double-checked and got 900pp. Wowzers! I'm rich! Dropped
the price to 700pp for quick sale (after agonizing for a
while about keeping it: greed won in the end).

So, now my 9th level bard has more money than he ever
thought possible. What do you experienced players suggest
he do with it? What sort of items should I be looking for
to help a low level bard? Strength enhancing items
would be good, just because he's pretty close to being
encumbered just from his armor. Is there any good,
lightweight armor I should be looking for? What about
special instruments or other bard-specific items?

Thanks!
