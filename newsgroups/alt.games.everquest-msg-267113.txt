Yeah - it runs fine on mine as well on the same default settings at 
1024x768. I do notice a bit of lag when I enter a new district in the bustle 
of Freeport and look around (all the new textures are loading) but after 
this initial graphics lag all is fine again.

On thing you forgot to mention: this game sounds awesome. The postional 
sound is excellent and in 1st person I can safely rely on audio for danger 
queues rather than continuously "checking my six" all the time like I used 
to do with EQ1.

My graphics card is currently the bottleneck, but I am happy with the 
current performance in EQ2 so don't feel the need to upgrade.
