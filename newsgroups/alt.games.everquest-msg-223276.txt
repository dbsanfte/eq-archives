Ry'Gorr Coif
No graphic?

Is this an installation/configuration problem issue... or does it just 
have no graphic. Its the only Ry'Gorr peice we've dropped so far... as 
pulling elites at 39th is a challenge :) so we can't comment on other 
pieces...yet.

But the Erudite Pali looks pretty silly with his pajama top poking up 
out his armour now...

Thanks,
