In fact, looking at Lucy...I'd expect Anarchy to have a higher than normal
fizzle rate.  It has a fizzle adjust of 25.  I believe positive fizzle
adjusts increase the chance of fizzling.

The reason I believe that is because Familiar has a fizzle adjust of 15, and
at level 57 with a Conjuration of somewhere in the 160s, I would typically
fizzle about 15 times.  However, Eye of Tallon would almost never fizzle.
Eye of Tallon is a level 57 spell, whereas Familiar is level 54, so you'd
expect Tallon to fizzle more than Familiar, but Tallon has no fizzle adjust.
