Maybe it was your reputation that made them chose YOU, but if you weren't
oocing/shouting, how else would they know you were LFG?  Do they send a tell
to all their cleric friends in the off chance?

More than likey they do a / all cleric lfg  and then look for familiar names

ooc "LFG" messages usually get lost in my melee spam anyway.. if they use
LFG, I can see at an instant, when i need to, who is available for a group.
