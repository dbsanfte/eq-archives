Aye, people come to these games for fun and the definition of "fun" varies
so widely from player to player, that's why I have a hard time being
persuaded by this argument. In trying to understand the objection I've been
searching for reasons that people think it impacts the game negatively for
everyone, rather than anyone's particular moral or gameplay-purity
sensibilities. I think I'm starting to hear more of those reasons now.

Supply and Demand should handle this. The desirability of items will create
more incentives to produce those items and thereby increase the supply and
lower the price. Happens every day in the bazaar. However, inflation does
have a huge impact and this is a bigger concern. It's interesting to note
that plat sales based on legitimate in-game plat farming doesn't strike me
as being overly inflative, it's when extra plats are introduced via
counterfeiting (i.e., plat duping) that you get real inflation. This is
evidenced, I believe, by the fact that prices have recently skyrocketed in
connection with recent plat duping exploits (or the sharks exploit), even
though online plat sales have been going on for many years.
