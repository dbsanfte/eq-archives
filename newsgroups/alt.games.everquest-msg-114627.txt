Ugh, That zone gives me nightmares, I got my HS key, I am NOT going back.
(Mistmoore can have the same effect, but without the one way ledge, and you
do get SoW in Mistmoore)

This isn't that bad, I can drag a corpse from the PoZ wall to past the see
invis line with my level 1 ogre without dying (but then when a_dumbass_0362
tells you to drag it down to the bank where the cleric is, *smack* *smack*
*assrape*)

The Temple area is fairly bad though since Zek worshippers are KoS up there,
the Throne room area is also annoying, since Zek worshippers are KoS there
also.

Assuming you're referring to succor to get across SG, it's not an
exploit/cheat; if you're referring to the camp/camp/camp trick at the CS
zone, then I doubt it will get fixed since there's really no way to figure
out why it's doing that in the first place.

This is when it's useful to have your corpse at a zone line so you can get
rezzed in, loot some, zone out for air, etc (for the Grey at least, in Kedge
just have EB cast/sung on you as soon as you're in)

As has been said, Air isn't bad since the first isle is non-KoS, just need
the wiz for port up and necro for summon

Hate on the other hand...

Lesser Summon Corpse only helps if you're under level 35.

Plane of Growth is nasty if you do it right, such as dying in Tunare's tree
after accidentally aggroing Tunare (since she calls everything else still
alive in the zone to her aid), but once again you can fix it with a necro.
