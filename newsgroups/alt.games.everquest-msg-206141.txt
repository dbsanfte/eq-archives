The list of expansions are as follows:
Ruins of Kunark
Scars of Velious
Shadows of Luclin
Planes of Power
Legacy of Ykesha (download or limited run of CDs available in stores,
$20-ish for the download)

Next expansion coming up is called "The Lost Dungeons of Norrath"
(Kinda breaking the naming pattern a bit, isn't it?). Yeah, it's gonna
be a bit pricey to get the whole run all at once.... Not sure offhand
what this "New Dawn" is. And avoid EBay like the plague as far as EQ
stuff is concerned. Any second hand CDs you buy there are worthless,
the keys are used and, thus, no good. Buying accounts, items, plat,
etc are against the game's Terms of Service and are extremely "gray"
legality-wise.
