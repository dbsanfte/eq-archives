On the EQTraders baking board, the discussion was
started on whether or not the events in the
Karanas would influence the price of fish rolls. A
user by the name of Keskan wrote:

This is OOF for this board I think, but what the
heck...

Is it known that it is the Plane of Disease that
will be opening? Are we sure? A guildmate was
present for a GM Event the other night were
Fironia Vie returned to Felwithe. She spoke with
her father, and then went to LFay and spoke with
the wounded unicorn Equestreielle. To make a long
story short, in order to call forth Karana's
avatar to cleanse the Karanas, it will be
necessary to repair Fironia Vie's staff. (You can
read more about this at our guild web site
http://WWW.DraconisRampant.org. Not advertising,
just for those that are curious.)

So, with that knowledge, is it possible that
rather than opening the Plane of Disease, might we
be looking at the opening of the Plane of Storms?

Discuss.
