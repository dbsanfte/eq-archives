   Ok, I know I should stay out of this sort of thing, but I've always wondered
about this.  How does attacking DT's sexuality (by implying that it's a wonder
that he found a girlfriend) do anything to strengthen the logic of your point,
or clarify your position?  You're certainly not the only one that resorts to
this kind of tactic, of course.  And it always brings about the questions to
me.  

   If someone implies that the person they are arguing with is either sexually
unattractive, gay, celibate, impotent, so on and so on, what is that meant to do
but hurt their feeling and/or anger then?  And what does it matter to the point
at hand if they are any of these things?  Case in point, Lenny retired from the
navy.  It last tour of duty, he was gone two years.  I was celibate the whole
time, save for when I saw him on leave.  Anybody could have responded to
anything I wrote on usenet during that time with "I bet you don't get any!" and
be quite accurate.  Would the fact of that somehow change the validity of my
points?  To me, and I may be alone in this, all it does is make the person who
makes these kind of insults seem petty and childish (the person they are
insulting frequently seems to be that way also, of course).  

   I know I'm not a perfect writer.  I have been told a couple of times that my
writing voice is pompous or condescending, when I certainly don't mean to come
across that way.  And I don't know how to change it.  I'll understand if you
start flaming me, Teckla, for asking this question since I chose your post out
of the several I've seen from other authors that also raise this point.
