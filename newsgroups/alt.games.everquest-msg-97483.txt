It all depends on what weapon you think you can get or expect to get. I use
a Polished Steel Ulak in my off hand and a Centi War Hammer in my primary.
Once my H2H is maxed I switch off my Ulak with a Bloodclaw Stiletto to
practice piercing.

Definitely keep your H2H maxed, but there's no harm in practicing your other
skills just in case you get a great 1HB or Piercer.
