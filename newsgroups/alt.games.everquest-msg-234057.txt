D&D is a bad comparison here. In D&D, you also could only cast a spell
once per day per time you "memorized" it and couldn't change the
spells you had memorized "on the fly". Sure, takes a second or two in
EQ, but it's far better than 8 hours' sleep to do so.

D&D's allowing more mem slots as you level is reflected by EQ's
granting more mana as you level up. The effect is pretty much the
same.
