Wrist - definitely go with RMB's they will ocst you 1k total but the extra
STR is nice.
Neck - if you worship Tunare do the Tunare symbol (Warden) quest, it's long
and boring but combined with the ES gauntlets and vambraces you can make
mana free kills (takes forever though).
Belt - Crystaline Silk Belt
Primary - Velium Etched Mace
Secondary - Testament of Vanear
Range - small wisdom diety
