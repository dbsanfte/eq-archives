Hmmmmm..... not too sure that I am too happy losing my pet to do this
solo.  I have never tried fighting without a pet..... is it workable
as a Necro?  I always seem to get stunned/interrupted whenever a mob
ignores my pet and attacks me.

I'm not interested in gaining levels quick - although its not a
problem if I'm having fun at the time.  I probably enjoy the game more
when I'm in danger.  I remember going to Katta Castellum with my level
11 bard to get a few songs that are only founf there.  That was very
scary (and fun).  The route back was less scary - I lasted about 30
seconds!
