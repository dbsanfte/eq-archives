Actually, that is very likely the case. Poison from spiders and snakes are
like procs. Despair is an ATK debuff, so you lower the chance that they'll
land a hit on you, which in turn lowers the chance to proc.

Yes. At level 22 you get your first Evocation spell which is Ward Undead.
Fortunately, you can practice it on your pet (even a level 1 pet will
suffice). If you work on it until your Evocation is in the 100's you'll
rarely fizzle it.
