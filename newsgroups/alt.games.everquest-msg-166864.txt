The top guild on Prexus did use DKP a long time ago, but came to the
conclusion it wasn't helping at all, and was, infact, a hinderance to the
guilds progress.

To my knowledge no other guild ever used it (except the guild currently
doing so).

My guild talked about it a while back, but there were enough people too
against the idea that we never took it any further.

DKP has flaws just like any other merit system, imo.
