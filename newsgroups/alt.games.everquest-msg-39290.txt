Hmm, I hadn't noticed. It was lighter than the fine plate I was weaing
before it, I know that =). I am not usually encumbered, but I have not
chosen any pieces for strength over ac. I am, however, still using a
lowly cracked darkwood shield, with +9 str (that's just because I
haven't been able to afford/loot anything better yet). And I have an EE
bag, herbalist bag, archeo bag, etc. (all the cheap/easy to get weight
reduction bags). I still think the +sta and excellent AC should be the
main thing a non-Ogre/Troll SK is concerned with at those levels, but to
each his own.
