I think so, though as you've pointed out there's no way to know how well it
will work until we actually see it in practice.  But as it's supposed to
work, you can make just as much money creating low-end components and
selling to manufacturers as you can building finished products -- so I'd
imagine there will be three classes of tradeskillers:  jacks-of-all-trades
who spread their skill points out to create low-end components of many
different items, generalists who create mid-level components of a certain
group of similar items, and specialists who take the mid-level components
and create one specific type of item using their very high skill in that
item.  But there's still the question of whether there will be enough of
each type of crafter.  I think there's a good chance there will be --
judging by the way real-world economics work out, I would think that when
there are too many specialists, anyone who tries to become a specialist will
be unable to find anything to create their products with, so many of them
will buyback some of their skill points and spread them out to make simpler
components to sell to their former peers.  If there are too many
jacks-of-all-trades, some of them will begin to pull their skill points out
of side disciplines and specialize in a certain type of object, since
nobody's buying their simple components -- they'll figure that if they use
the glut on the market of low-end components to create some higher-level
items, they'll be able to sell those items to specialists who aren't getting
everything they need.  I think it might be slow to get going but it should
even out.  I may be wrong, though, and SOE may have to put NPCs into some of
the positions players were supposed to fill -- I hope not because I much
prefer to deal with players than NPCs, it makes for much richer gameplay.
