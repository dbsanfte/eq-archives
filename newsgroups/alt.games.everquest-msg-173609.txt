Aye, but do not forget that fewer Americans voted for Bush than for
Gore.  Bush won the election while losing the popular vote.  It is
possible to do that legitimately under our electoral system, but it
is pretty fucking bogus for him to talk about "what the American
people elected me to do" as if he had some sort of overwhelming
endorsement/mandate from the general populace.  He came out on top
in a squeaker, the voters are obviously nowhere near a consensus
on who ought to be in charge.  At least we don't have a parlimentary
system tho, better 4 years of Bush than a new government every few
weeks or months as we see in so many other nations when public opinion
is divided so equally.
