Its hard to give an exact number for a few reasons: -

Different level guilds need different #'s of people to achieve the same goal

You will always have outsiders tagging along on a ringwar (including people
in high-end guilds) but you can't guarantee
a) their character levels
b) their character classes
c) the total amount of uninvited people

Also class balance.. e.g if we had 50 people there, but just 1 cleric, 1
druid, no shaman etc, then we wouldn't trigger the war

To give you an idea of actual numbers in the zone(assuming you know the
guilds im refering to) -

Assuming class balance (e.g a couple of clerics, a shaman or 2 and a few
warriors) we will trigger a war with as few as 30-35 people.
More people will log on throughout the war, and with uninvited guests and
faction leaches, you will see upto 60-70 people in the zone.
KtF uses a similar number (30-35 people) with anything upto another 35
people in the zone "helping"

When HoS did their first ever ring war recently (I wasn't in the zone at the
start, and only came in on a passing visit) there were 125 people in the
zone at one point, I dont know how many were actually HoS/allies though, and
how many people they use now (they won first try btw)

> Also, any tips on how it can be done would help also.

Well theres a huge amount of tactics involved in the ring war, from
controlling the dorfs (there are "heros" who, if you keep them alive, give
some pretty nice loot at the end.  Additionally whilst the heros are alive,
you can control their troops), to having "spotters" paying attention, the
raid broken into sections (centre, east, west, and a goalie at thurg)

The first few waves are actually very easy, but on the final wave of giants
you will see a massive difference in difficulty - kiting can make the waves
more managble so your faced with a few giants at once, not an entire wave,
but you have to ensure you don't fall behind because waves are spawned based
on time, not when you kill previous waves.

At the very end is Narandi the Wretched, he flurrys and casts turgers (slow)

Well actually some of the loot is pretty nice from the ring war (flowing
thought crown, flowing thought choker, bentos mask)

Im sure people from my guild and many others would attend (if nothing, for
the nice faction and fun that the 10th war gives) - as for us running the
raid for you - I don't know, its a posibility.  We've done it for another
guild in the past (about 95% our guild, the rest being the other guild), but
we were allied with them.

We still need 10th rings for ourselves though (and the list is never
shortening) so it would depend on raid plans for the night (what mobs were
up, the number of people we have on-line, if we were planning a ring-war
ourselves) - but I wouldn't completly rule it out.

Im not sure who is a part of the "alliance" now, as to if it could be done
by you totally in-guild and with allies, or if it will need an outside
guilds help (my feelings are that the guild "trinity alliance" wouldn't have
the people/resources for it)

Other guilds you could talk to (who would be big enough either alone, or in
conjunction with TA) who may be able to help (particularly if you can offer
them a loot arrangement that sounds appealing, or because they as a guild
are on Kael faction and are now trying to switch to Thurg on a large
scale) -

Birds Of Prey, D`Etre, Fallen Alliance, Harmony Of Souls, Infinite Vision,
Seven Tongues Of Chaos/Twisted Fates, Shining Alliance

I obviously can't 100% say these guilds can/will assist, butim sure you will
find help somewhere along the line

Btw the loot that a ring war can offer is as follows -

Head (for the 10th ring)
Narandis Lance
Mask of Bentos the Hero
Earring with a few charges of Divine Aura (priest classes)
A choker with flowing thought I
A hybrid helm (sk, paladin, ranger) with flowing thought
Eye of Narandi - a range item with a right click, 4 to stats, 40hp/mana
