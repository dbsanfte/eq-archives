Blah blah blah.  Don't think I'd ever acuse StanMann of being a 'hacker'.
Maybe a wannabe hacker, but not a 'hacker'.  Oh my no...Where do I get off?
Because of the way he feels the *need* to include little tidbits - oh like
what state the poster is in etc etc, and then after that pathetic dick
flopping contest with 'Morley'.  Where the in the hell have you been hiding
your head because you sure haven't been reading his latest offerings?  He
EXACTLY fancies himself as a hacker.  Perhaps you're blind to that fact but
I'm certainly not.

Anyone who bothers to actually check the headers would see it of course and
that's of course as obvious as the sun rising - but thanks for pointing it
out just the same, I think.  No, StanMann posts it for God and everyone to
see.  It's sick.  You haven't convinced me any different with your weak
reply.

Hmm.....he is?  I wasn't the one that turned a thread over to 2600 when it
wasn't going well for me.

Quit being pestiferous.
