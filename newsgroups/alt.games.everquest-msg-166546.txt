Ok. I'm stumped. In what way is Everquest a showcase for capitalism?

You could just as well argue that Everquest is a showcase for social
democracy with a strong social net. You get resurrected when you die and you
can get help from gms.

Or you could argue that Everquest is a showcase for dictatorship with SOE
having absolute power. There is a strong class distinction between the SOE
aristocracy, the player plebe and the npcs who don't even matter. Players
trust the SOE aristocracy to be benevolent.

Or you could argue that Everquest is a showcase for communism with players
working for the common good of the guild and helping each other. Grouping is
strongly rewarded. Free buffs, money and equipment is common.

Or you could argue that Everquest is a showcase for theocracy with gods
granting better armor and with a strong distinction between good and evil.
Players want to convert you to their guild.

Or you can say as I do that Everquest is not a showcase for a political
system.

You seem to equate the Bazaar with a stock or commodities market. I don't
think so. There are no stocks, there are no future values. It's just a
market, plain and simple. All countries have them. I agree that it's better
than the previous system of zone-wide auctions or even of server-wide chat
auctions (those still exist). It's the way SOE chose to go. It can be
improved a lot (offline trading, container trading, services trading, public
record of offer and sell prices), but the auction system could have been
improved too with Ebay-like tools and support. I remember the good auction
system on the old text-only Ronin mud.
