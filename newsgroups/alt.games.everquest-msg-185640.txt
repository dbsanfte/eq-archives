What this thread shows more than anything is
just how subjective offensive terms are.

One that caught my interest recently is the
lawsuit against Southwest Airlines (think
it's SWA) brought by 2 black men who believe
a stewardess was being racist when she said
"Eenie Meenie Miney Moe, Take your seat, so
we can go." over the intercom. My first
reaction was WTF would you have to smoke to
see a racist reference in that?  Turns out
that, in the 60's, that nonsense rhyme was
co-opted by some anti-Civil-rights groups in
the 60's and turned into "Eenie Meenie Miney
Moe, Catch a Nigger by his toe..."

Also, today while waiting for my eye doctor,
I was reading an abridged list of words that
are banned in text books in the US.  Many
of these words/phrases are simple descriptives
"the Deaf", "the Blind".  The word "Fairy"
is banned (substitute "Elf") because it is
now associated with homosexuality.

At what point do we cut perfectly legitimate
phrases and words from our vocabulary because
someone, somewhere used it in a derogatory fashion?
"Tastes like chicken" to me is what my dad always
said about rattlesnake.  "Eenie meenie miney moe"
is always followed by "catch a tiger by the toe".

Obviously there's a line, but the question is,
where is it, and have we gone too far?
