Just be glad you can still buy them.  :-)  At higher levels you
have to research some of the best spells, and that can be very
frustrating.  And then there are the ones you have to quest for!

Running through Neriak with my High Elf enchanter at level 8, with
nothing but Invisibility to protect me, to get Enchant Silver, was
one of the most fun things I've ever done in the game.  Felwithe
and HHK are cakewalks by comparison.

I did this with a 4 enchanter.  I went into the camp invisible, stood
behind the correct vendor, and cast Minor Illusion.  I was close enough
to make the purchase while I was a table or whatever.  Then I gated out.

I'm not 100% why sure I wasn't attacked while casting Minor Illusion,
but I wasn't.

BTW, a 4 enchanter is a good mule for trying stuff like this.  Can't
loose exp, but you get invis so can travel fairly easily.

Huh?  I just did this the other night.  I use a 2 wizard mule.  Stand
at the NW corner of the pool.  Target a fish (with F7 or F8, whichever one
targets the nearest NPC).  Jump in the water, nuke and stab.  Climb out,
bring in chanter, loot fish.  I've done this dozens of times including,
as I said, just a few nights ago.  Did they change this with Tuesday's
patch?
