The thing people aren't remembering is that EQ2 is not suppose to be
EQ1.  The developers have stated that it is a new game.  It is not for
the people who love EQ1, but to try to appeal to those who tried EQ1 and
left for whatever reason.  They are trying to get a different fanbase
since EQ1 is still going strong.

I agree.  The atmosphere in EQ2 is phenomenal, and it is hard to explain
why.  The quests are great, and definately a viable way to level.

I haven't given any thought on the linear class development.  I guess it
could be a problem if you wanted to have, say a troubadour (sp?) and an
assassin.  You spend the first 20 levels developing the same set of
skills, which might be a little repetitious.

My main problem is with combat.  I don't like how you cannot split the
grouped critters.  It seems pretty predetermined on what is going to
jump you, and you have no ability to try to limit the numbers.  It might
just be a matter of learning how to live with the system.

I am enjoying the game right now.  Heck, I'm enjoying it immensely, even
while filling out /bug reports.  It does have awesome potential.
