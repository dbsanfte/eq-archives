For general use things like GypsyMod (which gives you the
ability to move any interface element) is more than enough
for most folks - for the rest of us, it's vastly *more* 
customizeable than EQ1's UI.

Examples of mods I've written:

HealthWatch - keeps an eye on your and your party member's
health and gives audible alerts at configureable levels -
any .wav can be used for the alert, settings are on a per
player basis (so as a paladin I can have warnings for the
other tank at 40%/20% and for the priest at 60%/30% - since
I worry more about him).

DamageWatch - simply tracks the time from your (or your pet's)
first damage on a target to end of combat - displays elapsed 
time, total damage and DPS for the fight.  Nice for my Pally to
compare different judgement/seal combos.

ChatWatch - provides configureable sounds to alert to incoming
chat messages (each channel can be on/off seperately and have
a different sound) with optional echoeing of the message 
above the player's head.

PopTarget - for the variety of spells known as "targetting spells".
The default behavior for heals and buffs if you don't have a 
friendly target when you hit them is for the cursor to change and
for you to select your target after the spell.  The only problem
is that the usual hotkey bars are a ways away from the group
character portraits - PopBar pops a list of current group members
at the cursor when you hit one of these spells so you can target
with minimal mouse movement.  It makes self casting a simple 
double click.

And I'm just getting started - I didn't even know LUA before I
started playing in OB, and I've had to learn the API stuff through
reading other's code.  Now there's a WowWiki out there and LUA
is becoming second nature.
