Who I might add is enough of an ass to also email his stupid post to people
whose email addresses he culled from this group.

I have found that some of the Luclin zones are basically unplayable, except
with the graphics settings cranked down to just about the bare minimum, I am
not happy about that, but I am expecting that they will be improving things
over time.  There are a few suggestions I still need to try, being as my
system is well above the minimum specs, and above the recommended as well.
Last night I went to Kaesora with a total of 16 people, even with all
extraneous chat filtered out at server, clip plane way down, all graphics
settings off or set to low, there was still very low frame rate at times, it
never approached being as good as it had been prior to Luclin, when all I
had to do was filter out chat to avoid too much battle spam.  I had been to
Kaesora with a similar group about 4 weeks ago, I had only 256MB of ram at
that time, all other specs the same, the performance difference was like
night and day.

I am not planning on quitting EQ, or signing a stupid petition, but there
are a lot of legitimate problems out there, as witnessed by the number of
posts complaining here in the ng, and elsewhere.  I know several guildies
have yet to get their systems working with SoL, at least one of them has a
computer that should be more than up to the task, specs significantly better
than mine.
