Seriously. I haven't committed myself to this alt yet to the point where
I want to flush multiple Kpp into him, but I have started beefing him up
a bit. And the armor choices are fucking _hideous_ for stats! I can't
justify trying to drag a bunch of guildies into Karnors just to get my
alt some flayed skin (and I've seen none for sale yet in EC) but the
other choices which are easier to get are simply awful. Currently have
some of the Damask armor from Najena in several basic slots, and yes,
it's very light weight, but nothing in the stats dept. The gossamer
stuff from Unrest I could probably grab up solo, but again, that's maybe
one more point of AC per slot and still no +INT or resists of note. 

I've already got a FBR for the chest slot, will shortly have a festering
cloak for the back slot, hollowed bone bracers for the arm, and a stone
circlet for the head, (thinking about upgrading that to a dark circlet
this week) but the rest is primarily damask and it blows. What are some
fairly doable upgrades that I could work on to make my little dark one
better outfitted? (Going more for functionality than style, of course.
I'm looking for AC, HP, INT, Mana primarily. Pluses in any of those
areas would be great.)
