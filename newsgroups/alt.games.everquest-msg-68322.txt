    Ok. So my female dwarf cleric, who has had a brown beard since January
of 2000, STILL has a grey beard while the ERUDITES have had their beard
selection process expanded? GRRRRRRR.

    <chuckle> That must have been fun for the people that figured it out.
So, are there any good maps of ALL the new zones out there now? 8)

    This'll calm down the smiths over on EQTraders. At the old prices,
Combine Platemail had same AC, better stats, and lower weight than Fine
Steel Plate. There were some REALLY unhappy smiths over that. I wonder if
the sellback price was raised, too.....

>- Made several gameplay changes to The Grey.

    Heh, this was coming. There were melees tanking blues without getting
hurt, and AoE groups killing 30-odd blues at a time. It didn't help that a
guide was posted on either Graffe's or The Safehouse stating that with a
certain group makeup one SHOULD be pulling 25 to 30 at a time, or that
possibly the premiere AoE group in the game (a guild group from Triton, on
Povar) caught the attention of the GMs. (GMs actually thought they were
exploiting - they could not believe one group could kill as many blues at
once as they were.)

    The nerf itself is over the top, of course - the mobs in The Grey are
now so magic resistant that no caster is going to be soloing them - but
*hopefully* this is a stopgap measure until things like crashes are all
cleared up. Then they'll go back and look at balancing things properly, like
by raising HPs or damage output.

    This has got to be the single stupidest thing I've seen VI write. On the
surface, it's VERY reasonable and true - blatting 35 or more blue mobs on a
bar of mana is very over-the-top. But look at what they say it isn't in line
with: risk vs. reward and promotion of balanced groups.

    AoE groups are very high-risk. Even in the best such groups, members
will die several times over the course of an evening's play. What balances
this is the absolute mounds of XP they make per cluster-kill. Saying the
risk vs. reward is out of whack ignores how high-risk this sort of gaming
is.

    As for promotion of balanced groups, well, ask yourself who makes up
these AoE groups. The main proponents of them are wizards. Wizards who
cannot GET groups because they cannot compete with a melee in terms of
damage output per unit time, and have very little else to offer a group.
Wizards who had been begging VI for months to give them something, anything,
to let them earn a spot in a "balanced group", as opposed to being forced to
kite their way to 60. Wizards who already felt marginalized.

    Now look at the changes to The Grey. The changes specifically made the
zone near-unsoloable by any INT caster due to the massive resists on the
mobs now, in the name of promoting "balanced groups" - the exact group
composition that the solo INT casters cannot get into because they aren't
"good enough" compared with a melee. VI took one of the few zones where
these folks felt powerful and useful, and destroyed it for them. If VI
thinks the "you killed 35 mobs at once, we HAD to nerf" line is going to
deflect the anger over this, they'd best think again. The wizards knew it
was going to be nerfed, and even had ideas how to exactly accomplish this
without destroying their ability to hunt there - they won't accept that it
had to happen this way.

>- Tuned encounters in The Fungus Grove, Maiden's Eye, and Dawnshroud Peaks.

    <chuckle> More fun for casters gone, although this was deserved. VI
should have realized that any mob modelled on a REAL wizard would be so weak
that it could be soloed by a caster with ease. The WIZ mobs in Fungus Grove,
for example, were low-HP (for the level) mobs that chain-cast Ice Comet and
Draught of Fire. Pretty scary, until you realize that PC casters at that
level generally have massive resists and can RESIST Ice Comet and Draught of
Fire with ease (just like monsters do). As a cleric, when I see mobs cast I
laugh - they're nerfing their own damage output and making my job easier.

>- Added some newbie beastlord quests in the old world.

    The Iksar were complaining that they had no newbie quests - I bet this
is to fix that.
