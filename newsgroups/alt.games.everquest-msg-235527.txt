Actually: rule 5
Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be
either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth
Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan).

So the non-fantasy names are NOT ok, either.

I think we can all agree that the GMs have done a piss-poor job of
enforcing the naming policy. That doesn't mean the policy isn't there
or the name *should* have been allowed. However, after this much time
I'd probably leave Glorfindelx alone too. And fwiw, Glorfindel is a
pretty minor character in LoTR... minor enough that its entirely
probably that many people don't recognize the name/character.

Rule 10. Says: Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from
popular existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Drizzt,
Tanis).

"recognized" is their word not mine. Its not my broad sweeping
statement its theirs. And the inferenence that obscure minor
characters are ok stems directly from the fact that they aren't
"easily recognized"...
