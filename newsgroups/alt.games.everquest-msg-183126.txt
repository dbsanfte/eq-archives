And here's what I meant by being quicker and easier...no one gets lost
on the way there, causing a portion of the raid force to have to go
find them.  If it's a non casting class without an EB item, you can't
exactly just tell them to sit tight while you go do the kill.  The TL
pull is, as I've admitted, a quick lazy way to get the job done with a
minimum of complications.  You just need one person who knows his way
there, then poof, Phinny is at the zone where he is promptly whacked.
