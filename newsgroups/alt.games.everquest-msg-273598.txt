1) It's 500 for "Hunter of.." titles, IIRC.   "Slayer of ..." titles at 
5000?
2) In Qeynos, the wanted poster is in NQ by the Antonica gate on
a post.  It's hard to target -- I have to click on the side of it.

They're for mastery quests.   The one for Gnolls is found in the keep
north of the TS flight station (Gnollslayer Keep?).   No idea where the
others are found.   The reward for the quests is pretty good, in general.
