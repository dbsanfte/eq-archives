   Welcome (back) to FV, Lance... I recently started replaying there
myself.  It's helped my motivation to learn that the TLC can now be
gotten around by going into raid mode.  And the drama in my guild seems
to have mellowed out a bit, even though I will probably be looking for a
new one soonish.

As far as languages go, the big three you want to learn are Elvish,
Human, and Dark Elf.  Learn those and you're able to talk to about 98%
of the server's population.  Shoot me a tell if you'd like help with
that, or any other particular language.  Not to be a bragard, but
Teapray has mastered all possible languages, even the exotic ones.  On
the downside, last I heard language learning was broken.  But hopefully
that will be fixed soon, if it isn't already.  

   I'm probably the slowest leveller on the server... I'm sure you'll
catch up with me and Lenny in no time.  I'd love to have to opportunity
to group with you, and not just because you have a high level cleric and
can tell me if I'm messing up alot or what.  I also have a 14 level
beastlord ogre called Lentea.  I don't know that she's be the best third
for your duo, her skill will be pretty much redundant, though having a
second pet pounding on things is always nice.

Hope to see you around!
