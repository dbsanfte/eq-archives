  Ok, I try to steer clear of flamage, but um.. what?  Yes, the game has changed
alot in the past year.  But what makes you think that the nature of people
playing has changed any?  And what makes you think that Biz doesn't have any low
level alts and kept up the the changes?  And what makes you think that OP were
talking about the low leveled game anyways?

Basically... What the hell are you talking about?
