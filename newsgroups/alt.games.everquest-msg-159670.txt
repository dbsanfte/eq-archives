Irrelevant, Dex is no help at all for smithing, Strength is, but only if
it's higher than your Int/Wis.  There are other tradeskills that can benefit
from Dex, but, again, only if it's higher than your Int/Wis.

> 2) they can enchant the metals for jewel crafting

Yes.  And for smithing, and also enchant clay for pottery, and summon
various forms of mana for a variety or tradeskills.

Yes.

Yes.

The most self sufficient tradeskiller with the highest Int/Wis for gaining
skill increases would be an Erudite Enchanter.
