I wonder if anyone could enlighten me as to what SoE's rules are for keeping
a guild around.  I'm not sure I know how a guild is even created, but I
assume the 'Charter' they all have is part of the initial application?  What
happens if they don't live up to that charter, or if they consistently act
in a way that contravenes the EULA?  Does SoE have a team that checks on
guilds?  And if not, how does one go about reporting them?

Thank you for your time.
