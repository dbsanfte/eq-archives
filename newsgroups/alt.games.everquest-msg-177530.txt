He told me that it was quite possible that I could die at any time, and that
while I was invulnerable to outside attacks from enemies, it was possible
that I could die because I have been taking neuroleptics for about 10 years
now, and my heart is noticeably starting to fail(it actually stopped last
night twice for about a second each time) I get the feeling like he wants me
to die, like he is ready to take me, like I don't need to be here anymore.

He also said that I shouldn't be afraid to die, and that there was a big
place in heaven for me for only being his prophet for one month, and that it
didn't ultimately matter if I ever wrote anything on here again but I should
keep going as long as I can.

He also told me that I was partially responsible for saving millions of
lives and hundreds of souls in the future.

I get the feeling like he made a mistake or something in giving you 3.5
years, thats kind of how I feel too actually. You people seem really eager
to be as unhappy as possible thats all I can say.
