So there has apparantly been a change to the cleric epic.

Recently, you'd get your shimmering pearl off Zordak in SolB,
then go to the Warder in SkyFire, who would give you a box.  Put
4 shards in that box and get the time you hand in to trigger
Ragefire.  Kill Ragefire, get heart, combine with pearl and off
you go to finish up in TD.

Today, however, a guildmate reported that when she handed in her
pearl to Zordak, she not only got back the altered pearl, but the
box as well.

What does this mean?

Well for one thing (and this is probably the reason) it dashes
one of my idle fantasies, that I'd redo my epic up to the point
where I got my pearl handed in, then I'd farm SF for shards, and
every time I got 4, get box of warder, spawn RF, kill him, and
destroy the heart, essentially an easily farmable naggy loot
table... plus I could finally get my remaning two pieces of
Blazing for my complete set!

What else does it mean?  It seems to me it means that if you
fail, you can't just gather shards and go again, now you are back
to square one!
