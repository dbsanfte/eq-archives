Go stand way out in the corner by the Paineel stone so your repeated casting
isn't spaming anyone.  Summon a pet, any level pet will do.  Cast your
lowest level/cheapest evocation spell on your pet over and over again until
you max your skill.  Lucy is down right now, but I think Ward Undead would
probably be the spell of choice.
