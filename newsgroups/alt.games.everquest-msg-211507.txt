Initial support will be for 11000 instances.  At 4 players per instance,
that is 44000 players.  That's something like ~45% of the people online
peak.  At 3 players per instance, it would still require something like ~35%
of people online to be in LDoN dungeons to run out of instances.

I don't think with those numbers, allowing three people in would cause a
problem.
