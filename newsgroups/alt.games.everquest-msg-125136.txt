Hey, I'll have you know that she is not alone.  Although I have not listened
to them recently, I do own several Abba LPs.  One of these days I need to
get some of that on CD.  I don't recall for certain if they won, but way
back when, early to mid 70s, Abba participated in the Eurovision song
contest, they sang Waterloo.
