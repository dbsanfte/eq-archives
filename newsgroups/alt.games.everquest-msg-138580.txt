Yes and no...

You can tow 4 wimp mobs around the zone so that any higher level that tries
to agro on you can't get into melee range...

HOWEVER... :o)

This only applies to MELEE RANGE... casters that agro can still cast on you
if they're beyond melee range, healers can heal/buff the lawn trash if
they're on the same faction, mobs with missile weapons can use them on you
from beyond melee range.

Other dangers...

Even if you don't get any unwanted attention from casters, etc... you could
still draw agro from everything in range (and in some zones that range is
quite big) so that by them time you reach the zone line, there's a LOT of
pissed off mobs waiting to take out their frustration on the next poor sap
to enter the zone.

Your Lawntrash 'bodyguards' can still draw agro onto themselves if they're
on the wrong faction... and if they die, it leaves a hole in your defence...
and you've prolly got half the zone queueing up to wail on your
oh-so-clever-mr-smarty-pants ass! :o)
