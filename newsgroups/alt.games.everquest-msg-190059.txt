I enjoyed Fallout so much more than Fallout 2. I think it was just that the
story was more interesting. I'm really sure why.

I would love to see a MMORPG in the Fallout setting. While I enjoy the sword
and sorcery genre, I think other settings would be fresh ground for RPGs in
general and a MMORPG in another setting would be even better.
