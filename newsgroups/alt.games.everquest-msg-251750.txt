For the classes who can use it, like a druid and cleric, you can buy
the charred guardian shield in the bazaar for pennies. It is 9 wis and
around 10 ac I think. For either of those classes that amount of AC
beats no ac and one more wis. My druid carried around a testament,
from the old days, until it did buy a charred guardian.

You'd be surprised if you went in the bazaar and organized shield slot
and wisdom. several great things will pop up that are very affordable,
meaning a lowbie could buy one of those by selling spiderling silk in
less time than he could do the testament, while having something
better.

If you dropped me on a random server, unknown to me as a newb
character, I'd certainly have something better than the testament
before level 17. I'd have better stuff than all the newbie armors AND
the testament, with no outside help.
