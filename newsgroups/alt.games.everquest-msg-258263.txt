Because Rogues -do- tank better than casters do.  But if you're gonna be a 
wimp about it, I could chain Arcane Rune...

Yes, there are vastly better choices for a tank than a rogue.  But 
sometimes a warrior doesn't magically drop out of the sky, so you have to 
make do.  Personally, I'd rather have a rogue tank than sit here staring 
at mobs I could theoretically be killing, checking / war over and over.
