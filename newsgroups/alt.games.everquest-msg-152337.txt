    First point of contention. During caster balancing, a lot of wind came
from people like Furor about making the balance depend on high-end drops and
AAs - that this was "progression". People had to earn their increase in
power. This point was made over and over despite the reason for the
balancing - casters were out of whack compared with melees. So why are all
the warrior proposals I've seen on how to rebalance the class "inherent"
things, like better inherent taunt and better inherent defensive tables?
Where's the "progression" here? The arguement cannot be made that warriors
are also broken at lower levels and it's a question of scalability, because
lower level warriors don't have access to the all/all gear that breaks the
AC/HP advantage.

    Hopefully, some of that advantage will be restored with further ND-type
AAs, like the "Planar Durability" one in PoP. By multiplying base+gear HPs,
the percentage difference will not change but the absolute difference (which
has been eroding) will increase. The extended STA above 255 is also a great
idea, as it will help increase the percentage difference between the classes
due to differences in HPs/STA. I don't know that it'll be enough, but it's a
step in the right direction. What's the difference in HPs/level between
warriors and other classes? That should also help, with five more levels
about to be tacked on.

    Second point of contention. This is NOT an established balance. By this
reasoning, knight classes should have always been able to outdamage warriors
because they have worse AC/HPs. It is only recently, with vast improvements
to knight two-handers combined with erosion of warrior one-hander damage
output (EB proc instead of damage proc) that this has happened, and most
warriors feel this is an accident that should be corrected. What I feel
should happen in this regard is itemization - one handers with procs that
have EB-like hate and deal damage. No warrior complained about using a SoD
to generate hate because it did damage, too - let's go back to that model.

    I think the damage output penalty is somewhat of a mistake by VI. They
felt that hate generation was what a warrior wanted the most, and
implemented hate generation to the exclusion of damage dealing (which also
generates hate). It's as though they feel unresistable damage output would
be too overpowering, and if a damage effect is resisted its hate is
significantly reduced. Is that second part true? Did you find, during your
SoD days, that if the proc was resisted that the hate generated would be
lessened?
