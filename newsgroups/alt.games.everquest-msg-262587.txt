My state + county are iirc 9.735% (or some equally bizzare number, but 
it's in the 9's. Some counties are over 10. I think it is capped at 10.7 
or something) here in TN, but I don't have a state income tax... (well, 
the Hall tax, tax on investment income in companies with operations 
outside of Tennessee, but my Roth IRA ignores that) though that will 
very likely change.

Most of it is in bonds, t-bills, that sort of stuff. Low interest 
government very safe investments.
