No one else mentioned it so I'll put in my 2cp.  I have DX9a on both my
windows xp pro machines and it runs fine.  On some 98 machines that i've
seen, it causes choppiness and delayed imaging.  I can't confirm that it is
an issue with 98 because there are a lot of variables (vid cards, ram,
processor, etc.)  But the fact that my 2 very different xp machines run ok
and 2 very different 98 machines didn't, would make me pause before
installing it.  Also I did say the "a" version not the initial 9.0 download.
