That sounds similar to my first experience at Orc Hill, having no idea
what to expect there. It truly was magical. I always play with the view
from the chase camera so that I can see more of what's going on around
me. I remember one point that night where the few adventurers, including
me, that were on the hill were taking a beating from the orcs. There
were bodies everywhere, both of friend and foe. We basically ended up on
the hill in a circle with our backs to each other, swords in hand,
waiting for the next assault from the orcs, the one that would probably
finish us off. Needless to say, that assault came and succeeded. :( But
it sure was dramatic! It kind of reminded me of that final scene in the
Gabriel Byrne, John Malkovich, Leonardo DiCaprio version of "Man in the
Iron Mask" where the musketeers figure they are doomed, but charge
anyway.
