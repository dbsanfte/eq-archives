I know the feeling. I only have one character and it just hit level 24. I'd
suggest you do some research on your hunting grounds. Try the level chart at
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Level_Chart.html it shows where to go
within a  level range (as a solo mage I generally go for zones listed 5
levels above my current level, should be about right for a necro too). Click
on the listed zones and then check out the strategy discussions to find out
which areas have the wealthier mobs. I've also had good luck with some of
the mage and caster specific sites like http://eq.castersrealm.com/ that
have strategies listed by level. Kind of like the real world, you need to
educate yourself for a better income.
