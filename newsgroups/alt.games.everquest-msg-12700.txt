	I just find that irritating. It's hard to read, and when I'm trying
to follow three conversations at once, it's just extra work I don't need.

	I don't have a problem with troll/ogre speak, since at least it's
concise. The lisping iksar just drag stuff out, though, and that's valuable
time I could be using to floss my teeth.

	Besides, from an RP standpoint, Iksar have the same tongue everyone
else on Norrath does, so there's no reason they should talk that way. =P
