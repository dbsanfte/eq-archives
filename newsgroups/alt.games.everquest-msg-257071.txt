That's what I used to think.  But then I noticed these patterns:

-Everfrost Peaks (newbie zone for Halas): 75
-Halas: 125 or 100, depending on the list.  Newer one says 66% bonues,
or 125)...

-Nektulous (nothing but a newbie zone for Neriak): 75
-All three areas of Neriak: 100

-Misty Thicket (nothing but a newbie zone for Rivervale): 75
-Rivervale: 100

-Feerot and Innothule (newbie zones for Ogguk and Gukta: 75
-Ogguk and Gukta: 100

-BB (newbie zone for Kaladim and Felwith): 75
-Gfay (newbie zone for Felwith): 75
-N/S Kaladim: 125!
-N/S Felwithe: 125!

-E/W Freeport (newbie zone plus city folk): 75
-North Freeport (guards/merchants only): 100

-SF Mtns (newbie zone for Ak'Anon): 75
-Ak'Anon (Is there anything but Gnomes to hunt here?): 100

-Shadowhaven (No newbie zone here): 100
-Katta (necro's love this place): 85


Now, it seems to me that if you are in the city itself, where the only
thing you could hunt are the guards and merchants, they generally give
you a 100 ZEM.  But if you are in a newbie zone, or part of the zone
is a newbie zone, they usually give you the standard 75.

I did look at a few lists however, and have found some exceptions to
the above rule.  E and W Cablilis is the standard 75, as is FoB.  N/S
Qeynos are the standard 75.  Eruduin and Paineel are 75.

So perhaps there is no logic to this all.  Or perhaps they wanted to
reward you for hunting Dwarves, Gnomes, Human Paladins, High Elves,
Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres, Frogloks, Halflings, and Barbarians, but
not Iksars, Humans in Qeynos, nor Erudites.  Or maybe they were
smoking crack and picked ZEM's at random for these zones...

Here's an interesting one:
-Thurgadin: 85
-Kael: 75

A reward for siding with the giants?
