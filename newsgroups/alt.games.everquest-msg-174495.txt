Game Servers! Clan Webhosting! Communication Servers!  No Connection
Restrictions!  No Game Restrictions!

Cutting edge game servers at a fraction of the cost!  These are not
balanced load servers, or connection limited, you get total processor
domination and 40 gigs of storage to support YOUR GAME OF CHOICE!  As
of January 1, 2003 our pricing plans have dropped!  Why?  Because we
are sharing the wealth with our growth and making sure you get the
best system on the market at the lowest price.

Currently our technical support division and customer service is
second to none!  That's why we are growing and able to meet your
needs!  You are able to set up a game server THE SAME DAY!

Xdrive is currently looking for a new flash to replace our current
one. Not that we can't have our graphics team do it... We wanted to
give you a shot at a FREE SERVER!

We will be giving away a free one month server with your choice of
battle grounds to the flash that wins. If interested in submitting
please contact info@xdrivewebhosting.com for all your information
needs!
