Ive solo'd almost all of my carreer with all of my characters. ITs not
because I WANT to solo, but because I dont know how to find a group, and if
I happen to DO find a group Im not sure what will be expected of me in the
group! Sure, Ive grouped with friends with my druid, but all she's ever been
is the main healer ( Only 2 Deaths on my watch thank you  :] ). If/when the
cleric shows up I more or less feel useless, as the cleric can do what I Was
doing and do it SO much better ( no no class envy here.. Its a Fact of life
that clerics are better healers than druids ). My 2 "mains" if you will, a
41 Iksar Shadow Knight, and a 39 Wood Elf Druid, have solo'd most of their
careers. Heck, the shadow knight has been in exactly 3 groups that I can
think of, for proabably a total of 4 hours amongst them, and once again this
was grouping with RL friends so even if I did screw up they were to polite
to tell me : P

I WANT to group though. Unlike a lot of the people her apparently , I LIKE
grinding. I created a cleric to FORCE me to group, as clerics are difficult
to solo ( or so I thought ). I LOVED it. The process of keepeing a whole
team of people standing and healthy was a great challenge and great fun!
But, as a Cleric I KNEW my role in a group, and learned the more subtle
skills that were required when grouping. ( When to heal, what heal to use,
when to root park Etc.etc.. )

Believe me though, Id LOVE to Group with my Druid and SK too, but as the
title says Im scared to death that Im going to get a group wiped because of
some sort of ineptitude on my part.

I suppose Im just going to have to bite the bullet, make the mistakes and
learn from them........

I just feel sorry for any group that I may, unitentionally, cause problems
for : P

If anyone would care to illuminate me on the finer points of grouping as a
Druid, or SK Id be more than hapy to listen!!
