    I was more demonstrating that players as a whole are progressing. That
warrior that used to have a Cane of the Tranquil and a Jarsath Trident as
his main weapons now has a Frostbringer and a Centi Longsword. He used to
have a mix of crafted and indicolite, now he has indicolite, cobalt and
Thurg plate. His level may not be changing, but his ability to kill stuff
sure is. Should he still be killing the same stuff he was a year or two ago?
