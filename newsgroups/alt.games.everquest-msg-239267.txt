Flame Lick is highly useful because of the unique combination of it
is:

Zero mana cost in the grand scheme of things
Low recast time so you can chain it
DoT and debuff, mobs will resist a fair bit but hate it anyway
Fast casting so you can combine with Tangling Weeds

Snare used to be just peachy for aggro (peeling adds and the like)
however a little while back the devs killed the amount of hate
generated by it stone dead so - if anything - FL is even more useful
than before.  While hate kiting in HoH I've experimented with adding
Immolate to Flame Lick but the extra cast time just hasn't been worth
it.
