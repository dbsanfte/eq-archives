Its not bugged.  His agro range is very small, if you aren't inside it he
won't divert from his script path.

Invis and stand out from the corner, its very easy imo to target him - i can
do it when multi-boxing and concentrating on other stuff

Get close to him and run him to the corner

15 or so spawns in the past week have all worked fine for me personally, and
on venril theres a cleric/shaman who camp piglet pretty much 24/7

Anywhere at all

He spawns at the back of the pack
