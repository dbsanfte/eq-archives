Sony once published the number of spells and spell lines of the various
classes.  Enchanters won (or lost, depending on your point of view) with 43
spell lines - not spells, but individual TYPES of spells.  Druids and
shamans were at roughly 2/3 of what enchanters have.  Even without the
various metal etc. enchantments, enchanters far and away have more spells
than anyone else (though mages come close, if you add up all the pets.)
