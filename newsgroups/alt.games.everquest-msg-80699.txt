I grabbed the sleeves and boots for him in Sol A. on Saturday while he 
cruised around and got many of the other necessary items.

After we got the piece from Cazic on Sunday, grabbed some lambent stones, 
and finished his quests, he was only short his Lambent BP!

I lent him my Mith BP from my rogue, so he's covered there for a while.

We also took down the SK Liz in Cazic and got a piece for the SK armor.  
The third in our group was a 34 Wiz whose alt is an SL, so that worked out 
well.

Thanks to all fro the ideas and info.
