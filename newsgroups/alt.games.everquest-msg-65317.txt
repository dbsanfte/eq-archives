Have you tested the sound on DXDIAG?

To do so:
Go to your start button and pick Run. Type "dxdiag" and Enter.
When it loads, click on the sound tab. Click on the Test Sound Diag
button. Let it go through the whole series. I do NOT know what to do if
you fail, except perhaps restore drivers from your Restore settings CD.

But if you pass,
Log into the game. 
Under options, General, look for the sound sliders. Move them over to
the right a bit more.

When I finally got the video working, I started wondering about sound
meself. I heard *nothing*. Until I did the above. And yes, they weren't
slid all the way to the left before Wednesday, so it never occured to me
to even *look*.

Good luck,
