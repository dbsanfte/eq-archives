To lead some credence to this tale, the person who wrote this is also the
creator of a widely-used cheating program (Vaft's Trainer I think it's
called) that, among other things, allows you to warp to any zone you wish.

having gone through the flagging process.

Let me just say that I am by nature a very skeptical person, and I believe
