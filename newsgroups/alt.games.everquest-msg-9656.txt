You know, one of the uberguilds on my server seems to have a special
appreciation of gnomes. I spent a little while at the entrance of
Velk's last night with three tanks while the guild in question were
taking out lord Dolj and Velketor; they regrouped at entrance before
going to kill Velk. Not only do they have gnome casters, they also
have gnome warriors. And they are very big on GNOME POWER (as one of
them shouted to the zone as they were dropping Dolj)  :)
