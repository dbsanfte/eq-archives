I've stayed away from, or had my character run from, anything that
/con higher than my characters. Got one War to 9, another to 7, the
rest are 4 or 5 War. Still mny characters died a few times, but I've
managed fairly well so far.

I still see players have their characters attack monsters that /con
red or yellow to them. As an example, a first level druid taking on
a fire beetle outside Freeport. Probably didn't take, or maybe they
didn't pay much attention to, the tutorial.

If as mentioned here, that the folks who play as they get time, or
they solo, are 90 percent of the players, then Sony has its head up
a black hole and shouldn't ignore their cash flow on those accounts.
