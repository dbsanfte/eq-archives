Oh, excuse me.  Try this: "in British households hot water is used to
brew tea".  There's an equivalent generality that only a pedant so
anally retentive his fucking nose is stained brown would quarrel with
(and he'd be just as wrong as you are :-p).  I did not say "... in a
pickup group of strangers NBG is [only ever] a lie ...", which would
have been unambiguously universal and exclusive (and also obviously
hyperbole).  To infer universality in place of ambiguity, based on
your preferred reading and nothing else, is unwarranted.

Bah.  Neither my words nor their context (i.e. this newsgroup) warrant
your interpretation.  If I had wanted to make a universal claim (as
hyperbole) I would have done so.
