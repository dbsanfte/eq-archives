Wizard has higher burst DPS than warrior, which is useful in the event of a
potential KS fest.  If it falls down to your warrior tanking, you've
probably already lost most of your high damage people and it's coming down
to the last ditch effort.

Even if you have a drama-free (yeah, right) camp and pull, there will NOT be
a second chance if you wipe unless you've got a second force set up to
engage long enough for the first force to get back, but if you're doing
that, then there's no excuse for failing in the first place.

Best way to insure an RF kill is to borrow/rent a mana/life burner though.
