True story.  I'm helping a buddy out and he needs a TP from South
Karana to Kunark.  My 48 (at the time) druid isn't doing anything
pressing and he's a real life friend so I tell him to meet me at the
NK/SK bridge and I'll get him to the OT.

So, I port in to North Karana and see somebody /auc'ing 200pp for a
port to West Commons.  If I had the time, I'd have jumped all over
this, but I currently have a goal so I start running for the bridge.
Within seconds I get a tell, "Can I get a TP to WC?  I'll pay 200pp".
I feel for him.  It isn't a pleasant run, but I'm occupied.  I tell
him I'm sorry, but I'm already helping a guildie out (negligible lie,
my friend isn't a guildie, at least not with that character, but he
has been a close friend of mine since high school).  He reply's
"Please help me out, I've been asking for a Tp now for 2 hours!!"

Two hours.  

No, if you go the LONG way from NK to WC (NK to SK to Lake Rathe to RM
to Ferrott to Innothule Swamp to SRo to Oasis to NRo to ECommons to
WCommons), you can make the run in just about a half an hour, maybe 45
minutes.  And that's UnSoWed.  I know, I've done it with my troll
warrior.

Now, I realize that teleports are mighty damned convenient, that's one
of the reasons my warrior is level 34 and my druid is 50.  But idiots
that depend on them with that kind of blind, cow-like devotion,
deserve to have their time wasted.  IMHO.
