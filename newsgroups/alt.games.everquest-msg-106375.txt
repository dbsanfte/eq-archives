Mages have quite a few at 54 (YAY - made 54 today in
a CoM raid  :)  Killed Lord Rak Ashiir twice, with just
my pet, and 2 clerics and an enchanter (chain runing),
both times he dropped the Ornate Rune Blade.  The Pally
who gave me the Words of Bondage to research the fire
pet won one - Karma) but I'm not sure we have as many as 
enchanters.
