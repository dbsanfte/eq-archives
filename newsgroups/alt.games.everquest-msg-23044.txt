I think you guys have just proved John Smith's statement about "high level
players":  "They can sometimes be real idiots".

I guess some of you also get a kick out of mocking the disabled, the fat
people and anyone else who is not up to your own "high level of
intelligence" or "linguistic perfection".

I'm not native to your language myself but I'm trying to master it to some
degree, I really am - and I believe that this counts for something. So I get
a really bad taste in my mouth when I experience people like you. I thought
EverQuest was supposed to be a social game, but also a game, which went
beyond the physical borders of countries (or is this just due to the money
involved?), and I don't think your attitude is very encouraging for this. Am
I wrong here?

To you Lokari I'll say this: Don't fall for this kind of condescending
behavior. You seem like a sensible person and I can't make this behavior fit
to a person able to take photos like the one you expose on your homepage. I
think such an artistic ability requires some degree of sensitivity and in
consequence of this, the ability to put yourself in another person's
position.

If you don't agree with a contribution in this newsgroup, then comment on
the issue, not the writer's linguistic abilities.

So go for it John, keep expressing yourself.

Duriel, Lord of Darkness
