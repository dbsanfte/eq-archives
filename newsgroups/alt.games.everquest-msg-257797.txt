The changes in PS2 -PS3 dont even give better quality or cinematic lighting 
and shaders, they just allow longer shader programs and a more optimised 
path because of culling which can occur at an earlier stage.  As proven in 
games like farcry which with a patch has moved to SM3 (more than just PS3) 
the same quality of images can be rendered on a PS2 card, they just come at 
a slightly (read slightly) bigger hit to the pixel shaders usage.  So the 
difference between 2 and 2.1 is not worth speaking about.

Regardless you called it a marginal DX9 card, when in fact its a true DX9 
card.

No offense taken, i can pretty much upgrade my GPU to whatever i want, its 
just i dont play too many games with the exception of EQ, i recently got 
doom3 which i can play at 1280x1024 (albeit with no aa) and it plays fine on 
high graphics mode, the cpu probably helps it a long, but neverless it 
performs ok.  As EQ is reporting 50fps at almost all times during play, i 
dont see any reason to upgrade it, and as i said in an earlier post, the 
engine appears more CPU limited as well.   As the new GPUs have there focus 
fixed on PS/VS improvements and speed, and driven by the fact EQ uses 
neither (or almost neither) of them at all, led me to the opinion that 
upgrading the card past a certain level is not worth it. however upgrading 
the CPU seems to have had a big effect and gives performance increases in 
almost everything else you will do on the computer.

And was there a big outpouring of complaints when it did show up?  I dont 
think there was.  I have yet to see a game i cant play on the card, if you 
can name a game and i can get hold of then i will accept that i was proven 
wrong.  However you say that with no evidence whatsoever.

No its got nothing to do with pixel shaders, as they still have to support 
the dx8 and below class cards which dont have this functionality at all. 
The problem is with the p*ss poor attitude that SOE have to testing, it 
should have been on the test server first, where they would have realised 
there was issues and got it addressed.   DO NOT blame this on ATI or PS2.1 
hardware as it is quite easily seen on the SOE forums as originitating from 
NVIDIA cards as well.  Again if EQ is using PS for anything then it must 
have a fallback option for the cards which do not support it , or does not 
support PS at all.
ti4200 is  a PS1.1 as is the ATI8500, cards below this have PS1.0 or nothing 
at all, and still have problems.
