Ah, useful, thanks!  I'll have to kill greenies in there to get a sense
of which direction they path in when running, so I can clear those mobs
before we trigger him.  

My husband has it in his head that HE should eat the harmtouch, so that
the pet can stick around to help deal damage and he doesn't have to worry
his head about me, but I'd like to talk him out of that.  (His pets gotta
have more than 1k hp, doesn't it?) He gets it into his head to prove that
the shaman can rough it with the big boys (or little girls as is the case
with my rangerette), but I'd prefer he didn't do it when a rare mob is at
stake.  When he has torpor I'll be calm about letting him get punched
around (I have a lot of respect for shaman's sticking power, I do), but
I've experienced Stoicism and it ain't all that and a bag of halas 10'
meat pies.  

Say...that Muglewump thing drops a shield with a charge or two of rune on
it...maybe I should go harass my favorite overgrown tadpole...

P.S. Is it true that angry goblin respawns on server up, unlike !%!#%@#$@#
Stormfeather?
