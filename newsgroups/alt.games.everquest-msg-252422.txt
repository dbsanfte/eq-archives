The thing that strikes me is, what this person has done seems like a 
beautiful attempt to create a test case.  Perhaps, if pursued, it could 
set a precedent for the interpretation of property laws in regards to 
virtual properties.

And this would be a wonderful thing, because thenwe could stop having 
these threads arguing between people who insist it's defined one way or 
the other, when there simply isn't a definition yet, which leads to them 
going on forever.  Damn fascists should realize the authoritarian system 
in place doesn't have all the answers yet.
