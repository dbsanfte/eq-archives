The skyfire ramp is good exp from 25 to 35, and some people stick to it 
till 40.  Song of the Highsun is level... 56 I think.  Close to that 
anyway.  All mobs normally pulled in a ramp group are going to be deeply 
green to a 56 bard, unless he's there stalking dragoons, which is 
unlikely, after all, why not take the fight to them, with selos and 
track, silly to hang out and wait for something that rarely wanders by.

A joker not grouped with you is a possibility, but... well some joke. 
I'd bet its grounds for marking your records if reported, if, that is, 
your victims A) figure out what happened, B) report it properly  C) 
happen to have bard songs not filtered so they -can- report it properly 
(which is to say, show bard singing and mob that doesn't have Gate 
gating) and hardest of all D) find a GM who gives a flying mongolian 
cluster these days.
