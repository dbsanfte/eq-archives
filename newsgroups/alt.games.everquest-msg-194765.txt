  You sure about that?  I have a 64mb ddr GeForce 2 GTS that's run like a
banshee for a few years now.  Upgraded my dad's system to GF4MX 64 so he
could play NHL 2003 and it ran horribly.  I put the same card in my system
and it got lower benchmarks with the video card being the only difference.
  That being said, I don't know if a GF4MX is a GF2, but I'd tend to stay
away from any GF product with MX in its name.  It's inexpensive for a
reason....they SUCK!

  To the original poster, look online for a low-cost TI card.  Radeons are
decent too.
