Each server is basically what you said the first time, the same environment
with different people.  There are some exceptions to some servers, namely
the PvP ones, where players can kill other players, and the Roleplaying
server, where there are special rules and RPing is encouraged.  Once you
start a character in a server that character can only be accessed from that
server (unless you get a transfer, but then they lose all their equipment
and money).  So in choosing a server it is recommended you choose one where
your friends are.  If you don't have any friends playing EQ then it is
really up to you, although there are some servers that have a higher
population of certain nationalities than others.  For example, my server,
Mithaniel Marr, has quite a few French on it.  I am also told there are
quite a few Japanese on it, but I haven't heard that much Japanese spoken
(typed) myself.  There is also a fairly large guild of Norwegians (hope I
got the correct spelling :-)).  If you are American and don't have any
friends in EQ, then it probably doesn't matter :-).  Not sure if there are
any servers that really dislike Americans :-).
