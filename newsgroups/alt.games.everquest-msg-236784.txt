That one is easy... If God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent, 
it follows that he cannot change his mind, and therefore all prayer is 
worth precisely squat.

I guess it depends on one's definition of "evidence".

I see your point, but while the existence of the universe can be 
explained with a few pages worth of equations, the existence of a 
talking fish or a two-mile tall white guy with a beard would probably 
take a lot more explaining than that. Any of the two would go much 
further towards counting as "evidence" of a deity than the mere 
existence of the universe, which is only splendorous if you choose to 
look at it that way.
