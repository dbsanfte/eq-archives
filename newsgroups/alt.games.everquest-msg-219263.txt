Took me weeks to get my first character to 10th, course that was 
r.zek... waaaay back when you could both lose xp, and be pked during the 
lowbie levels, and I probably had 8 characters up to 5th before any of 
them broke 10th... I took a while to settle (on a starting city/ and 
server). But it still takes me several hours, unless I'm going out of my 
way to either twink/pl/ or repeat specific newbie quests doezens of times.

But yeah after a year: 7 and 4 is pretty weak... that's someone who 
hasn't spent much time online.
