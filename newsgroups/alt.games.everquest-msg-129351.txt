Sorry to burst your bubble DT, but a lot of Lad's are Versant's fault.
They constantly play with internal resources on the opuses side to the
detriment of players no matter what type of connection they have. Also,
GM's are the front line of customer service and as such should respond
to petitions in a timely manner. I have a relative who is a VIP at Sony
(hardware side), and also happens to be an avid EQ player. He once got a
snotty response from a GM and guess who is no longer a GM or even has an
EQ account.......
