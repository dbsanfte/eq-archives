Over time, I see this happening.  When broadband becomes so common that it
costs more to cater to the dial-up customers than they get from them, then I
think it'll happen.  Otherwise, I think that the client software takes care
of enough to keep the information transmission to a minimum.

OTOH, Microsoft would eat even more money on the sale of each X-Box if they
made them dailup compatible (the hardware is a loss-leader), so I can
understand why they would want to cut their losses.
