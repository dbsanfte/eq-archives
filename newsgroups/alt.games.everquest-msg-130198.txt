Had posted earlier asking what the opinion of the group was on the best
class for PvP but now I have some questions about how it all works.

I am playing on Talon Zek (Teams).  I know the team divisions, Evil, Elf,
Human, Short (love that name of the team, just makes me laugh).  Anyway, a
couple questions:

1. Is it impossible to attack (as in on accident) on on your team, just like
on a normal server?
2. Is it possible to cast beneficial spells on opposing team members (in the
odd case you want to make a temporary treaty to group together)?
3. Is there any kind of player economy on these servers?  If so, how does it
differ from blue servers? Also, what is the auctin/bazaar channel for that
server if there is one?
4. Are there any good websites on PvP and strategies, ideas, etc?
5. Any other tips that you would like to share would be greatly appreciated.

Oh by the way, (and I know this will sound odd) I ended up going with an
Ogre Shadow Knight (140 STR, 127 STA, 75 AGI, 75 DEX, 80 INT, 67 WIS, 42
CHA).  I know I'll have to work on Intelligence as I go, but str I should be
fine with.

Oh, that brings to mind another question.  I have read that Strength affects
the rate at which you learn offensive/fighting skills, yet I have also read
that Ogres learn their skills slower due to low intelligence, which is the
case?  And how does that work out?

Thank you all again for all your help to me as I've been learning EverQuest
over the last few months.  Been a great journey.
