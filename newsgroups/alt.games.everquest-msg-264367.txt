Racial traits will undoubtedly be a factor in balancing the classes
for PvP though. And as it stands, there are still talents missing
from a class or two.  That's got to be considered a core feature.
If the rumored release date is correct, they have very little time
to get that stuff in and fully test it before it goes gold.

I'm also a little irritated when I see people keep saying that other
MMORPG's shipped in worse shape. It was wrong for those
companies to do so, and it would be wrong for Blizzard to do
so as well.   I don't like the idea of paying to continue beta
testing.  I remember reading endless complaints about several
MMORPG's that shipped too early.. right here in this very
group, and many other places.  And some of them suffered
for it (SWG anyone?).  But you say it's just fine if Blizzard
does so, just because it's more "done" than the others.  I'd
prefer Blizzard stick to their previous position of "It ships
when it's DONE and not a moment before".

Now that EQ2 moved up it's date, I imagine they are scrambling
even harder to get the game out the door.  Having played in the
beta for several months, I just have a bad feeling about this.
Blizzard is one of those companies that people love or hate,
and it won't take much for some people to go overboard and
really rip it to shreds if it's not that great at launch.
