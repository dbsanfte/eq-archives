No, since you didn't collect them for the quest.  It's the
same with getting a quest to go kill mobX -- you have
to kill them after getting the quest, previous kills don't
count.

See?

The 'shortcut' around that is to give the clusters to someone
else and have them give them back to you one at a time.
They would then be counted.  That's a bug/exploit/feature;
the game only knows you're getting them one at a time, the
same as if you were collecting them.
