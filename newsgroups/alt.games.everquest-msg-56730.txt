OK, I'm not sure where you're posting from, but I think something is a
little odd about this.  You claim to have petitioned at 4pm, which
would have to be PST, since the servers weren't up until at LEAST
then, though I think they actually came up after that.  Then you say
you waited 4 hours, which would have made that 8pmPST, which is
4amGMT, but your post came in at 3amGMT.  So, either this is a crafty
troll or you need some remedial time-telling practice.
Giving you the benefit of the doubt, and assuming that you really did
log in and petition on Wednesday, there is a very, very good chance
that GMs were busy dealing with people re-popping zones and sending
unsuspecting people to Plane of Hate and other abuses of the
/groupbuff line.  Maybe wait until they get the bugs worked out, then
log on, /petition, and /re-petition again in 3 hours if you hear
nothing.
