I'd guess they appear to suck to you since you don't seem to
know how it works.  Heals no more than 75% of the total health
to a maximum of about 3000 HP (2925, but that's close.)  That's
different than "heals you to 75% but not more than 2925 HP."

As long as it's cast like a CHeal, they're likely to get the max
efficiency of around 7.3 HP/mana.  That's not a sucky heal.  It's
nowhere near as efficient as a maximum CHeal from a cleric, but
no cleric heals that way anyway:  no one has 10,000 HPs, for one
thing, and no cleric heals routinely with the tank unconscious
for another.

CHeal on a 7000 HP tank, hitting at 10% is about twice as mana
efficient.  But how often do you NEED that efficiency in XP
groups, especially with a 7000 HP tank?

Anyway, they've moved the heal up to 58, apparently, which
addresses my concerns about 54 and 55 clerics.

And, the 58 and 60 hammers drop in SSra, IIRC.  They have *very*
slightly better stats, but the 60 hammer has essentially the
pre-nerf proc rate on the hammer.  The 58 has a proc rate of
about half the pre-nerf (now 60) and post-nerf (56) hammers.
They're an obvious "must-have" for anyone who actually uses the
thing and has the level needed to cast them.
