Hi.  I live in upstate New York.  It's a short car drive to the Big City 
for me.  The list of local folks who have lost someone close is growing 
daily.  We've got a lot of mideastern people living here and have for 
years--many of them on student visas that are handed out with no 
security screening at all.  A great deal of my town's water comes from 
an open reservoir.  I think you're an alarmist putz who hasn't the 
faintest idea of the real gravity of the situation.  You're trying to 
patch a volcano with tar.
