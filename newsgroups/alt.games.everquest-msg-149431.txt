I find that 70% of the time, this is because (a) nobody announced that a %T 
was rooted and the spell effect message is easily missed in combat, and/or 
(b) you're fighting 3 %T's, so they back away from the one they see that 
isn't rooted right toward the one that is.  

It'd also be nice if they backed up when a mob is mezzed.  That tends to 
space out the mezzed one enough to make it easy to pick out the other ones I 
need to mez.

But space is tight in dungeons, it ain't always easy.
