The only time I had someone leave an adventure, it was a very pissy 
druid, who was our main healer, half way through a collect xx items 
adventure.  Left me as the main healer, as well as the slower.  We 
managed to succeed with a few minutes to spare.

Personally, I don't even consider doin an LDoN group unless I have a 
minimum of 2 hours available for certain, preferably 2 and a half.
