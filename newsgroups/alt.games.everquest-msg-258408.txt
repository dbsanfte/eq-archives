'No fault insurance' has nothing to do with disregarding the idea of 
fault. This is a common, and unfortunate misconception.

The primary features of no fault insurace are:

1) *Medical* bills are paid immediately by your own insurance company 
without regard to -fault-.

2) You are limited in your ability to sue the other driver for 
additional damages. In a pure no-fault system you cannot sue at all. But 
there are no pure no-fault systems in existance; you -can- sue if the 
accident reaches a particular threshold for severity or cost.

What many people who aren't in a no-fault system don't realize is:

Your insurance company still assesses fault, and will reclaim repair 
costs from the insurer of the other driver, if another driver is deemed 
to be at fault. (Usually without an expensive lawsuit.)

Your insurance rates will still be affected by fault. If your insurer 
determines that you are at fault for the accident, you can be damned 
sure your rates are going up. So fault is still of paramount importance.

The main benefits of no-fault are:

1) Medical and repair bills are paid immediately by your own insurance 
company. You aren't at the mercy of the slow, difficult, insolvent, 
whacky, foreign insurer the other driver has selected, a company with 
absolutely no incentive to pay out. Remember *You* aren't their 
customer, treating *you* miserably isn't going to affect *their* 
customer base). 

With no-fault you deal with your own insurance company, that you 
selected on the basis of customer service, price, reputation, etc and 
who does not want a reputation for screwing its customers (and thereby 
losing all of them). This is a *major* benefit.

2) Majority of accidents do not require a lawsuit to settle. (Fewer 
lawyers = significant cost savings for insurers, theoretically reflected 
in the rates and speed of resolution.)

The main disadvantage of no-fault is:

As a result of 2) above: Fraud. (Perpetrated ultimately by unscrupulous 
medical professionals generating inflated bills against staged 
accidents) This sort of fraud occurs with regular tort insurance too, 
but because those all have to run through a successful lawsuit the 'easy 
payday' is harder to generate, as the suspicious insurer has more 
ability and time to fight the payout.
