Why the hell is everyone so worried about what other people do? Petition
your own guildy for a NAME? What the hell is wrong with you? You should be
ashamed of yourself and then deguilded pronto.

Yes ostensibly this is a RPG. But unless you are on FV, you really have no
reasonable expectation that ANYONE is going to roleplay. If you want to
that's your perogative. But to run around petitioning other peoples names
strikes me as holier than thou and very selfish. To ruin someone else's day
for something as petty as your personal opinion of their name is a very
shallow thing to do. So don't group with them if it offends your
sensabilities that much. Or /ignore them if it really bugs you.

If more people worried less about what other people do and more about
themselves, everyone would have a lot more fun.
