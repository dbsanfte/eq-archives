Canada produces more polution than we do as a result of their exporting
green energy around the world.  England and it's factories also produce a
significant amount of polution, more per square mile than the U.S. does (not
sure about per capita).  Developing nations also produce a large amount of
polution as they pass through their industrial phase.  The U.S., however, is
a net loss, as far as greenhouse gasses go, due to all the nice greenery.

The Kyoto treaty would hurt the U.S., but it would hurt developing nations
more.

Hughes is talking about the U.S. socialism supporters.

Why is missle defence seen as pork, while research into the cure for cancer
or AIDS isn't?  We've been working on cancer much longer, yet we aren't any
farther along.  I think attacking the military-industrial complex sometimes
becomes an instinctive action.  Sometimes, it does achieve something good.
