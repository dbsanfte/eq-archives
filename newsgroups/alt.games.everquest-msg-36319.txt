    The skeleton guards are not something you should worry about - run right
between them, and you'll be fine. I once tested them, and Lifetapped one a
few times - he didn't move, but swatted me like a fly when I got within
melee range. I imagine so they don't go crazy out in the newbie garden
they've been hardcoded to not move from where they stand.

    What you SHOULD fear is the SK that can spawn above the newbie area. He
has HT and Darkness, and he will likely catch you. Other than binding right
at the entrance and running like heck, there's not much you can do about
him.
