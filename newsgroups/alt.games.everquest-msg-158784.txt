Let me guess: one *sniff* to detect the mindless knee-jerk Socialist and the
other *sniff* to make sure your own aroma of knee-jerk radicalism is still
present?

*sigh*

The thing I hate most about politicians is knowing the reason they are all
assholes is just because they are merely representing their constituents.
Anyone who needs to mindlessly follow some ideaology instead of thinking for
themselves is one sad fuck.

It is easy to discover if this applies to you as well, do you choose overtly
politicised news sources or do you try as much as possible to find unbiased
information?
