I decided to "beat" the RNG one day... and did.

Tradeskillers and melees universally notice how skillups and combine 
successes are less than random.  I had to make a ton of Heady Kiolas one 
day and decided to beat the RNG.  My skill in brewing was not too much more 
than the trivial of HKs at the time.

First round: I made 8 stacks of these things by just clicking as much as I 
could, only stopping to rearrange, etc.

Second round: I did 8 stacks, but as soon as I failed on one, I stopped and 
waited about 6-8 seconds before continuing.

Third round: Same as first round.

Fourth round: Same as second round.

On the 2nd and 4th rounds, I cut my failed combines in half, almost 
exactly.  On rounds 1 and 3, I was failing the combine right at 20% of the 
time.  On rounds 2 & 4, it was right at 10%.

Or course, Sony could claim that it's not supposed to be random, and that 
several in a row just mean you are "on a roll" or "in the zone."  Of 
course, they'd be lying to cover up their weak-ass RNG.
