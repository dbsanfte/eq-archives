I play regularly with one other guy. We each have a 5 ranger mule for
tracking rare mobs. Whoever is most likely to hold the mob and survive
(usually me for snare and SoW) will remain on while the other logs the
mule. Track until it is found, Hold mob with some form of attack while
the other logs the mule out and the primary back in.

Of course, I hit 20 very soon (half a yellow bubble) and it becomes
moot. Maybe I will play the ranger as a character then... he is
default twinked as a mule. Maybe I will recreate, as playing a
character called 'goawayimbusy' may be difficult....
