Since it was asked about before, the following snippet concerning EQ's
servers and bandwidth consumption is from a recent article online.
(Which can be viewed at:
http://www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest_b.html )

Sony Online Entertainment on Hardware:
The entire EverQuest (EQ) universe (at present, 40 separate worlds) is
run on  approximately 1,000 servers. These are located in our onsite
datacenter and at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego, less than a mile from our
offices). The mix is about 60/40 (here vs. AT&T CERFnet).

The datacenter design was built to handle not only EQ, but our games
coming out next year, so it has worked beautifully for EQ thus far. The
challenges from a network  perspective have been mostly ISP-related. We
have some pretty fat pipes to the Net, and  when one of them goes down,
it does cause some concern. The biggest issue has been getting our ISPs
to have very quick response times from very skilled technicians. We deal
with ISP-level issues and need to be able to speak, as quickly as
possible, with highly competent support people who can identify and get
to the bottom of the problem.

Being a pay-for-play service, you can imagine the heat our customers
apply when things are not working to their satisfaction. We have also
had to get past some technology issues due to the nature of our network
traffic. It doesn't really look like your typical Web traffic, so we
have definitely pushed the envelope on what some of the higher-end gear
can do. As far as the coolest stuff we have, I'd have to say that would
be either our Cisco GSR 12012s or our EMC storage devices (Terabytes
large).

Sony Online Entertainment on Bandwidth:
At peak, we are using approximately 1 Gbps of bandwidth. The data rate
per user is
something we can control, so we know the direct correlation of number of
simultaneous users to bandwidth. It has, of course, grown as our user
base has grown, but the surprise is more from the user-base size, not
the bandwidth.
