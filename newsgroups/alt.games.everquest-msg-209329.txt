I imagine that at the time they were all under the gun to get the game going
right and they decided (rightfully so) that having to summon a pet after
zoning really wasn't that big of a deal (considering all the actual
IMPORTANT issues back in 1999).

It's all about priorities.  It costs virtually nothing to summon a pet.

Four-plus years later I've heard maybe 5 people whine about having to
re-summon pets (not counting in a.g.e) so I think that Verant made the right
decision to ignore this.
