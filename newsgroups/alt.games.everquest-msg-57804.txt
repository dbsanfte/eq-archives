Your 48 Druid should be able to help him out just fine...

Drop down, clear the area, then have him drop in to loot his corpse.
Then just port out.  Or you can slowly work your way to the exit, 
with him staying behind you so he doesn't get killed off 
prematurely as you clear the way.

You could even bring a few invis potions, and just run for it after
he loots his corpse.

My Paladin has helped several people get out of the "sub-basement"
of Kurn's, it's not hard.
