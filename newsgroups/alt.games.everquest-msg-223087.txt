Maybe I should have said "incompetent" instead of "lazy ass" : ) I have been
doing some charming with about 4 mobs in Echo Caverns atm and there has not
been much room to manuevre so I have to double back on the mobs a bit and
with limited room I get tagged a bit. After about 30-40 minutes I am down to
about 30% life, something the ICC could proberly help with given the
slow/steady decrease. Outdoor where I will be getting tagged much less it
may not be needed.

I have both Chimp and my bard camped at OOT atm and been on Stormhammer atm
it is a good time to go for it as the 2 hours I spent last night (before the
server came down for patching again) I was the only person in the zone.
Depending on how long it takes to get the AC to spawn, after the bard has
looted the ring I may pick up a spare for Chimp to keep in the bank to MQ
any other alt I may raise. Camping on Stormhammer is so much less
competetive than Tunare so I would hate to waste the opportunity.

I must have lucked out as I picked up a Goblin Gazughi Ring right away in
the Bazaar for 2.5K. Haven't seen it again since though so. The Bazaar on
Stormhammer is a little odd as it it is so top heavy levelwise. "Uber" items
and trade components are hideously expensive yet "Mediocre" items tend to be
very cheap. For example I picked up a Sainy's Claw
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=253  for just 5PP about 2
days ago (I had been neglecting my peircing).

Yup - it's the "juggling" part I am trying to avoid most of all. Minimising
the workload let's me concentrate fully on the tasks that remain, you really
cannot underestimate my ineptness when it comes to EQ. It's the reason I
solo nearly all the time unless my guild requests my prescence for a
particular (simple) task. Instrument juggling and multitasking is definately
a competent bard prerequisite... but I am aspiring to be one of the other
types of bards ; )
