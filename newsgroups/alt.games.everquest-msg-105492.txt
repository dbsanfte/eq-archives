I would say it is NOT a dungeon cos it is relatively small area, thus easy
to escape to zone + has guards there that assist you in killing the MOB's.
Since the guards are not statically placed by the exit, but actually walk
the halls "protecting" you as they go by, it is a safety thing here.

If the whole place was like the tunnels with the netherbians and fungoids
running from the main corridor, and NOT have ANY guards at all..(or maybe
static at zone exit) then it would definately be a dungeon..

Btw.. The easy XP from killing the guards there are now broken.. there is a
faction message now :((
