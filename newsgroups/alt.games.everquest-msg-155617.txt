My 43 cleric spends 90% of his time grouped, that's been true for at least
20 levels. Haven't had any significant trouble finding groups since around
level 20; basically if I'm in a level-appropriate zone and there are at
least a dozen players in it, I get offered a group quickly. In DL right now
there are always 3 or 4 groups advertising for healers.

Of course the tradeoff is that I can't solo for beans. I'm a strong dwarf
cleric and have good armor, so I can take more punishment than any other
caster, so I am less panicky than others when mobs aggro on me in a group
setting -- but despite having a good weapon and having diligently advanced
my Offense and 1HB skills, I can't lay out damage worth a damn. Every so
often I get tempted and try soloing a dark blue someplace, and it's just not
plausible in terms of xp/hour. I soloed a fair amount in the teens and it
worked ok then, but not since.

My fellow guildie clerics who are in the high 40s tell me that my solo
career is about to resume, however. At 44 I get Banish Undead, which
apparently does double the DD of my current undead nuke; plus they gave us
Bash and I have a shield and have been working on that skill by bashing mobs
while fom and grouped (it's up to 61, woohoo!). And I have a focus item that
extends my roots and fears. So I'll be shortly heading to Oasis of Marr to
kite spectres. One guildie cleric just went from 44 to 47 in no time,
soloing there all the way.

To your original question, at least on the Saryrn server, busy zones like DL
and GD and OT and SolA are always busy with full 6-person groups, no
standard pull spot goes unclaimed for long.
