Again, I write as the popular wisdom goes, as I have not gathered
empiracle data.  But what everyone *else* seems to say on the subject
is that there are two kinds of attack.  There is weapon-skill related
attack, determined by your level (and thus skill caps) along with
attack buffs, such as those rangers, beastlords, shadowknights, and
necros cast on group members, and item buffs such as "Vengence" or
"Aura of Battle".  These do indeed increase your chance to hit any
given mob with any given swing.  Str adds a different kind of attack
buff, which increases the amount of damage you can do with each swing
by what is said to be a very small amount.  It has no affect on your
chance to hit though.

Both Str and attack buffs will increase your attack rating.  That is
why this confuses so many people.

Now to be honest, while I believe there is probably much truth to the
popular wisdom, and many times I dont bother to cast a str buff, I
also believe that we base a lot of our popular knowledge on data that
were not collected correctly and which are outdated.  For one, I
believe a lot of DPS parsing data have come from people fighting
scores of relatively low level MOBs.  It seems logical that an attack
buff could have different benefits when fighting MOBs well below your
level, and those above your level.  I also believe it is possible that
we rely on outdated data.  Witness the myth of the 10 delay minimum
(minimum 1 second delay on swings).  It didnt exist, but many still
believe that a weapon cannot have its delay reduced below 10 through
haste...even today, based on a faulty study conduced a long time ago.

My conclusion is that while it is *probably* true that strength will
not affect your chance to hit, I encourage people to just go find out
for themselves.
