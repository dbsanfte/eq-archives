I am running a P3-800 with 768MB of 133MHz SDRAM, and a GeForce4 Ti4200 with
128MB of DDRAM.  It works quite nicely with the exception of the usual
suspects, like the Bazaar.  You can upgrade the processor on your MB most
likely to a faster P3, or, with an adaptor, to a P4 I believe.  I am
currently toying with that idea myself, but the perfomance I am getting now
is such that it is not at all a priority.  I run the new UI at 1280x1024.
