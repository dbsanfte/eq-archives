Necros level faster than most others even with the pet.  I could be
wrong but you do not suffer a greater penalty every time you add a
pet.   The benefits of pet far out weigh the penalty.


I laugh at people that say lose the pet because of experince.  Screw
you buddy this pet has saved my life to many times. I find a new group
and charge that other person for corpse summons.


Stackable DOT's  not at level 8 but eventually.

Heart Flutter
Leach
Heat Blood
Darkness
Venom of Snake
Scorge

I have stacked 5 but really on used 3. Most of the other slots were
used for defense spells and fear
