Hey you left out my favorite alternate.

Anarchy Online - Although I haven't played it in a year.

AO has (and had long before) many of the features that EQ added in
expensive "expansions"  such as maps, chat channels, port "books", and
they had a better way of doing selling, where you just put up into a
global database what you wanted to sell, and price, and people could
just buy it, and you'd have money when you logged on.  But that was
broken when I tried it last :(.  It was very skill tree based, and
everything started to look the same.

Also Star Wars Galaxies should be comming out sometime soon.  But from
what I've been hearing it sounds like a real Dud.

EQ 2 sounds like a real dud to me as well, especially if they do some of
the changes they made for the playstation version.  Maybe after it's
been out a year or 2 and proven itself.

DAoC - screwed up RvR play, and not much else.  Might be fun for a
distraction for a month or two.  Sadly the PvP Teams servers on EQ are
better.

AC2 - Deserted arcady game, give it A year or so and maybe it will be
fun for a distraction.

Everquest - What I keep comming back to.  For the main reason that there
are so many different stratagies and things to try and do.  Other than
Customer Support which has just gotten worse and worse as time goes on
the game itself I'd say is in it's best state ever (i.e. most fun). 
It's evil, stay away from it.  It will suck you in and never let go.  It
might ease up for a month or 3 and let you have a taste of freedom, but
then it will grab you again and drag you back kicking and screaming.
