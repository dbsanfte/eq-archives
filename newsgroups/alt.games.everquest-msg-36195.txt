Ok, so I misinterpreted the tone of your post. Basically, I read it as
saying "Huh? What are you talking about? That didn't happen on our raid!"

>Not enough coffee yet, Rune?

I blame it on the V8. I have an empty can of V8 in front of me, yesterday
I took one sip and gave the rest to the toilet gnomes. Who the hell drinks
this? "Boy I'm thirsty, let's have nice can of chilled vegetable soup!"
