I've not noticed that, but I do have a problem where any time I go to 
windowed mode and then back to full screen, it backs my gamma setting way 
off, though the slider position in the display options doesn't change. I 
have to just move it a tick one way or the other then back and the gamma 
level corrects itself, or sync's back up.
