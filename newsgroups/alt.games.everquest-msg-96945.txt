I'm not clear on this one.  Was the rumor that he was a cheater or that he
lost the tournament?  Cause the first would not happen since GM's generally
do not report offenses to the community, and he didn't actually say that
they did do that.  If the second one, well he's just being a big baby to
quit over one lost tourney.  Not that I've ever been in one, but it still
sounds stupid.
