My bestlord is 59, and there are a lot of things I don't know where they
are if I haven't been there. Butcherblock was one of them; I never had a
reason to go there, so why would I know where it was? I started in Shar
Vahl, levelled up in Shadeweavers, Kurns, and other things, and went
lots of different places over the levels. But everywhere in the game?
Nope.
