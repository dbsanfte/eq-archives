No, you are still learing the ropes, quite normal.  Or actually quite
probably you are doing something wrong, but you just need to learn.  I
suggest shouting out to the zone you are a newbie, and would like to
group with someone who knows what they are doing.  If you want to rake
in tons of platinum save your pelts and spider silks and sell or trade
them to other players.

Took me to my 5th or 6th character before I even got past lv 12 - of
course that was in the hard old days.
