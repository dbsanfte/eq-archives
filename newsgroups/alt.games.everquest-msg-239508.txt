Actually... 

Bard song/melee damage scales up an order slower than the other
classes. 

Like mages whose contributor power is largely limited by their pet and
its relatively fixed power level, while  bard output is similiarly
limited by a fixed (sub) 18 second duration and 3+e second cast times,
with no ability to push the bounds of either.

Or consider the stacking capability of other casters... an enchanter
can make use of far more than 8 spells at a time; sure he can only
have 8 memmed but he can utilize more than that...  a KEI cast hours
ago still benefits him...

A bard can also mem 8, but benefits from 5-6 at a time tops. So not
only does the enchanter derive more benefit per spell when compared
directly to bards but they can derive simultaneous benefit from more
spells too. Granted they are limited by mana... but with focus items
and massive modern mana regen is ...mana is not limited like it used
to be... but bard songs *are* almost exactly like they used to be.

Bards have a particular set of abilities that allow them to do some
amazing things ... like swarm kite... that were likely unexpected by
SOE, and certainly unbalanced in their favour... but in many
situations a bards power level has been shafted quite a bit.
Fortunately they still deliver unique utility, and are still quite
versatile for tasks like pulling, tracking, etc... and are still
desirable on that front...

I don't think bards 'suck' ... not by a long shot... but I do think
there are serious balance issues both for and against them that I
would like to see addressed...
