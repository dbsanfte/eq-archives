quite true

I consider calling someone a pussy (cowardice) to be less harsh than calling
them a coward.

In referring to a vagina, I find "pussy" less offensive than "cunt"

In referring to a prostitute, I "scarlet woman" less offensive than "whore"
and "ho" to have more of a sting than "whore"

I'd taken it as a given that synonyms having slightly meanings or emphasis
was understood.
