You have to realize that finding a 'proper hardware modem' can be 
something of a challenge these days.

More importantly you have to realize that a 'winmodem' or 'HSP modem', 
is not 'teh debil', anymore. (HSP stands for host signal processor, and 
refers to the fact that the modem utilzed your system CPU to perform its 
signal processing... [the modem uses your cpu to perform its Signal 
Processing, and your cpu is part of the 'Host system' from the point of 
view of the modem].)

Now: Recall that they came out during the Pentium era, that's "Pentium", 
by iteself with no numbers or letters after it, not even MMX. At that 
time an HSP modem was fairly CPU intensive (10-30%), and had a dramatic 
effect on games. Today the HSP modem requires just as much processing as 
it did in 1995, and today that's a barely a blip on CPU load.

In practice, yes a nonHSP modem is still faster, but these days its on 
the order of 0.5%-1.5%, if that. Given the price differential the value 
proposition of a 'real modem' is pretty negligable.
