As an experiment, to examine the relationship between an EQ char's
displayed "AC" stat and actual combat results I created a L1
Human Paladin and provided him with a Finesteel Shortsword, a
Large Lanter, and a full suit of Banded Armor.  Our hero's
stats are str85, sta100, agi75, dex75, wis80, int75, cha85.
The key stat here is AGI, which I wanted at the "norm" where
there are no bonuses or penalties.

For Beetmi's first mission as an armor test pilot, I sent him to
East Freeport were there is a Soulbinder and an almost always
empty newbie yard.  A very nice additional feature of EFP for my
test is that "a fire beetle" is always a L2 mob (I have conned
easily over a hundred of these with various lowbies over the
last 2-1/2 years, always yellow to L1, even to L2, blue to L3
thru L5).  I "fought" one or more "a fire beetle"s to 13 of my
own deathss, and killed a couple besides.  I mostly just let them
kill me, using Lay Hands to prolong the agony, in order to get
a fairly large number of attacks logged.  For these first results,
Beetmi had a Defense Skill ranging from 1 to 3, giving a displayed
AC ranging from 154 to 160.  He was hit 650 times for 1234 damage
(1.90 avg per hit) with 177 misses (21.40% misses), for a net
damage per attack of 1.49.

Next, our hero was permitted to "test" his shortsword for a while.
Once he was L4 with his Defense skill maxed at 20 he was sent back
to EFP to engage some "a fire beetle"s again.  This time he was
sent in naked, with a displayed AC of 59.  He was hit 296 times
for 1078 damage (3.64 avg. per hit) with 404 misses (57.71% misses),
for a net damage per attack of 1.54.

To recap, comparing an "AC" of over 153 derived almost entirely from
armor to an "AC" of precisely 59 that was entirely intrinsic I saw
dramatic changes in the chance of "a fire beetle" to score a hit
and to the average damage per hit, with less than a 5% difference
in the average damage per attack between the two test cases.

I seems to me that this easily recreated test demonstrates quite
clearly that your displayed AC cannot be considered a "stat" by
any reasonable definition.  "AC" is nothing more nor less than a
rough guide to your passive melee defensive capability computed
in a way that differs substantially from the mechanics used in
EQ to resolve melee combat. The evidence suggests a two-step
combat reolution in which the chance of an enemy scoring a hit is
affected primarily by your Defense skill while the amount of damage
done by a hit can be mitigated by your armor.
