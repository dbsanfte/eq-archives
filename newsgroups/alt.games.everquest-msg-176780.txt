At 188, you're not going to have much luck making money off of smithing.
You can make that leet, heavy, no-stat AC 19 breastplate... that's about it.

In order to make money, you'll need to grit your teeth and at least get into
the 240 range.  Then you can make Heraldic stuff, which is a great source of
income.  You'll make your plat back in spades.

But until then... well, you're pretty much stuck.  I once made a profit of
150 plat making 120 Antonian Javelins for someone.  Not exactly a cash
bonanza.

With tailoring you might have more luck... I would often buy large
quantities of leather padding from player vendors in the bazaar for my
smithing combines.  You're not going to make tens of thousands of plat a day
like you might as a human GM smith, but you'll probably eek out a decent
profit margin.

But the big bucks are always going to be found in the 200+ range of a
tradeskill.  So if you're looking to make plat, you'll need to do a bit more
work on your skills first.
