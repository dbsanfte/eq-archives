Maybe the level 49 pets, but from what I've heard, the post-50 Fire pets
are almost useless.  Even by the standards of people who have found ways to
like Fire pets.  They don't get Fire Elemental Aura, they get O'Kiels
Radiation.  (And cast it on anything near them that even *might* be an ally
from what I've heard.)  They cast a small selection of Wizard spells,
ranging in level from 12 to about 39.  Most are All Or Nothing resists, and
since the pet is about level 45 or so at most, that means mostly nothing if
you're fighting anything that gives you exp.  Oh, and they cast Cancel
Magic.  Constantly.  Good luck keeping something snared, dotted or rooted,
since I'd bet good money that Cancel is the only spell they cast that will
stick most of the time.  And since there are no known Focus items that work
on the post 50 pets, they only have "normal" firepet health, if that much. 
They're masters at blasting totally green lawn trash.  And that's about all
they do.  Use them in any situation where you would drag along a level 35
guildmate Wizard (preferably one you didn't mind getting killed.)
