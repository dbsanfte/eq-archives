Eh.  I have yet to find a fighting game that lives up to the Street
Fighter series.  The 2D Mortal Kombat games were good.  Virtua Fighter
was good, but none of the 3D fighters (including the painful Street
Fighter versions) I've played seem to the depth that Street Fighter
did.  Hell, it's the only fighter that I can think of that can allow
somebody to play a primarily defensive game and still have a chance of
winning.


But I digress.  :-)
