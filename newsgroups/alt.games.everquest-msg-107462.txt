I was at work to day,where I tend to think of all my dumb ideas,and I was
remembering this company that was designing a device that would blow scents
at you while on the computer.The precise reason or need for this eludes me
right now.But I think it would be a neat peripheral for EQ.The way it
works,as I remember it,is that a piece of plastic with "bubbles"of scented
gel would be slid into a computer controlled heating unit.Much like those
plugins air fresheners.The total amount of scents per plastic card I'm not
sure of.Any way I think this would add a new wrinkle on the EQ
experience.You start at Kelethin (the scents of bark and grass blow up at
you) head to butcher block (the scents of gravel and grass waft up) as you
near the coast the scent of salt water begins to rise until its nearly all
you smell....ect you get my idea .
