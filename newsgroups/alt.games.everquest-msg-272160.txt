Likely because, among other things, the wholesaler requires you to make 
items that are outside of your area of expertise, not to mention, often 
requires you to make relatively expensive items that he then takes from 
you.

The society levelling needs work in order for people to want to do it.

One problem I found was that when I joined my tradeskill specific 
society, it removed me from the original society, which I then had to 
rejoin.  I don't recall if I actually checked if I lost all the earned 
status I had prior to being removed.  I know I did lose all the status I 
earned when in a guild that I later left, so it would not surprise me.
