THis could be a problem if it isn't totally new. IF someone has used it
already to set up an account then the discs are useless to you beyond
putting the software onto a machine. THe 'key' involved is not a CD key to
regiter that the game is genuine - but to start the account for access to
Sony's servers.

You don't need to go get them. THe loading system for the game includes
auto update.

Expect a long wait to patch the game to the current level of play if you
are buying an older set of CDs

We are talking hours even on a broadband if you have to download all the
new UI stuff I would think. I hesitate to imagine how long it will take on
56k.
