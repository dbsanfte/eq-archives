Or Newsfeeds, Easynews, or the free news.freenet.de :)

*** I posted this once before, but didn't get any definitive answers, will
*** try again just in case.......since installing a LinkSys router at
*** home, I am getting disconnected from EQ on a pretty regular basis,
*** about 4 times an hour or so.  If I unplug the router and go directly
*** from my cable modem to my ethernet card, I never get disconnected.
*** This is getting very frustrating......anyone else experience this or
*** know some tuning on the LinkSys that might help ?   TIA !!

** If your router firmware is newer than 1.40.2, this will happen. There was a
** thread about this on the EQ forums somewhere, and it helped my LD problems
** to go back to that version. I guess the newer firmware thinks the EQ servers
** are trying to hack your computer, instead of reconnecting, so it blocks the
** connection.
**
** Hope that helps some.

* Joe, absolutly, thanks. I found the same information by searching
* google.....I dropped back to 1.40.1, played tonight for 4 hours, and
* no disconnects !!  Use to disconnect about every 15 minutes with the
* later level bios. 


Sorry about having to spend $90 :(   I hate paid computer diagnostics, it seems 
that they almost never turn up any conclusive nor positive results (that's if 
you get any results at all).
