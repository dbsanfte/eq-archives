The rule of thumb I use is to charge about 1.75 times the price of
materials for a given item.

For example, +6 wis rings cost about 106pp to make, so I charge 175pp
for them.  Often people offer less, so you have to judge if it's still
worth it to you.

I sell to guildies for the price of materials, even though that results
in a loss to me.

Items which use the rare gems are trickier to price, since the prices
of the gem seems to vary quite a bit.

Hanging out in EC (or whatever) and seeing what other jewelers are
asking is a good way to get a sanity check on your prices.

I doubt you're going to find a web site with useful prices.  The ones
I've seen (for example the one on castersrealm) have wildly varying
prices (sometimes more than one entry for the same item), with prices
that seem to me to be very high.  I think some of these price guides
were made when 200 was the maximum jewelry skill.

No matter what you decide to charge, someone is going to complain.
There have been several occasions that I've been discussing prices
in tells with two people at the same time -- one insisting I'm charging
too much, and the other saying I'm charging too little and ruining
the trade by "flooding the market!"
