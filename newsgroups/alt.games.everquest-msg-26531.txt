Basically you don't. Harmony (Druid/Ranger spell) is the best method
assumming the Druid/Ranger knows how to use it (don't always assume
that). The various lull spells will work, but unlike harmony, if it
gets resisted, at least all the non-lulled mobs will come at you. A PC
much higher than the mobs can generally single pull out of a camp.
Ranged weapons like bows are only slightly less likely to attract adds
as melee weapons.

I assume you have the lull undead spell. This is your only real option
to single pull a tight camp (obviously a camp of undead.) I would use
a spell to pull with--if you have an anti-undead nuke--that will work
best.

In a loose camp you might be able to pull one of the end mobs out with
a spell.

In either case you want to pull the mob(s) reasonably away from the
others before you engage in melee.

You don't mention it, but another option is to "break" the camp.
Breaking a camp means killing all the mobs in the camp but with enough
time between each kill to space out the spawns. For example, lets say
you are at a camp of three mobs with a 18 minute respawn rate, and you
can only take one at a time.  If you killed the first mob at 9:00am,
the 2nd at 9:06am, and the third at 9:12am, you now have single spawns
spaced 6 minutes apart (the first mob will respawn at 9:18, the 2nd at
9:24, etc.)

The best way to break a camp solo is enlist a high level PC. You could
also use spells like root and fear to buy you some time while you try
to quickly kill one mob at a time. Another tactic is to say root one,
run the rest of the camp to the guards, then go back and (slowly) kill
the rooted one.

LOH obviously a huge help in breaking a camp solo. And remember if you
don't evenly space out the spawns enough, to pull reasonably far away
from the camp so if the next mob spawns early, it won't become an add.

All said and done, as a Paladin you really should start trying to
group more. However, if you plan to solo often, then you'll really
need to invest in some good gear as you continue to level.
