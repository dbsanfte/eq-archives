I know better graphics help. What I was wondering were, whether the
graphics were as bad as I was experiencing.

As it happens, I got the answers I needed, so the title worked fine. I
also got a pointless debate about the title.

 I'm currently deciding whether to *buy* an expansion to see what the
graphics can be like.

I think it's a bit disingenuous of Sony to give a downloadable trial
version that (apparently) shows the game in much less than its best
light.
