I'd be more than willing to spend some $$$ for that.  If that day comes, I'd
do it.  Heck, even if it's a stripped down version of the world, and I could
only access the original areas (pre-Kunark) I'd be happy.

BUT, part of the thrill of EQ is the social aspect. take that away and you
take away a key element of the game. I don't know as if I'd play it for more
than a few months at most, then every once in a while just for nostalgia's
sake.  It's nice that I can do that with UO from time to time, but it just
isn't the same.

If the day comes that they pull the plug on the original EQ, I would hope
that they release the server software as public domain. But considering the
horespower that they use to run "one server" (whichI believe is a cluster of
servers) I doubt that many people would be able to run it.
