My news server blocks titan2's posts, so I don't know if this is the
complete post.  Can't understand what he's trying to say though.


Am I missing something obvious here?  If a hacker gets your account
name and password, and then changes your password, then YOU CAN'T
PLAY.  So, if, after reporting that your report was hacked, Verant
decided to suspend or ban your account, SO YOU CAN'T PLAY, then what
the hell has changed???

Please, if I'm missing some vital part of logic here, can someone
please point it out to me?
