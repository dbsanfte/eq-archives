1.) You must be upset over the recent grouping exp changes...why?  I don't
know, but I can't understand why you would *never* before post to this NG
and complain about this type of subject.
2.) EQ has *so* many more subscribers than the competition that this should
*tell* you something about EQ versus it's competitors.
3.) I solo about 1/2 my EQ time because I'm dealing with RL at the same time
(kids and such) and really don't see the new changes affecting that too
much, yet I really like getting to group now, since I get great exp in
groups where I didn't before.
4.) Even though in my situation where I *must* solo occasionally because of
time restraints when I do get a chance to play, I certainly *cannot* justify
a reason to play a MMORP*anything* and expect soloing to be a reason to play
such a game.  Especially when I pay to play this type of game.
5.) You are a stupid troll.

Sean...
