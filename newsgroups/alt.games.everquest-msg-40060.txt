Still mulling over where to next take our happy little band of 45 to 47
level hunters for xp, and one suggestion has been to go to Timorous Deep
and hunt the Spirocs and (if we fill out the group) maybe even the
raptors.  Couple of questions for whoever has spent any significant time
in that zone:
  Assuming your silly enough to be travelling around without anybody who
has SoW or levitate, how safe is it to go from island to island swimming
in that zone? Any underwater wanderers to be aware of? How about the
dragon, Feydedar... does he pretty much just hang by the firepots when
he's not already been killed?
  Any good strategy tips for spiroc and/or raptor hunting? Is it even
worth going?
  Another possible destination under consideration is the Seafury
Cyclops in OoT. (Can you tell I have an island vacation stuck on the
brain?) Or possibly even Kael Drakkel to hunt giants. Hrmmm... tips?
Hints? Random abuse?
