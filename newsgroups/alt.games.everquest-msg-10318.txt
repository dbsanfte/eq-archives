When one of the patches happened about a month or so ago, Verant changed the
levels that some classes get some of their spells at.  I didn't bother to
save the eqnews.txt file (whatever it's called) and now it's been
overwritten by a more recent patch message. Sony's EQ web page is hopeless -
it's got the most recent patch message, but no archive of past ones.
Anyone know where I can find that info, or still got the text file?

Thanks,

Rich
