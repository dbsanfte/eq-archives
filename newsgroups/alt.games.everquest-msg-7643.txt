    Heh. Recently on my server there was a big fight over Frenzied in Lower
Guk (heh, like that's never happened before). One group had evacced, and
when they came back another group had taken "their" camp. Then, when a
Frenzied popped, the inevitable KS fight broke out and the newer group
killed it. But one of the older group was a member of a very strong guild,
and called for support. And.....

    Two level 60 wizards and a level 60 puller (ENCH for chain stuns I
think) arrived, and claimed all of Lower Guk. For the next hour they pulled
*everything* and AoE killed it all, until that second group got the hint.
One of the original group, a 45 shammy, was grouped with the three level 60s
so as to heal and slow anything that got loose from the stuns. He made three
full bubs of XP in that hour, and that's in 45 hell.
