According to Sony/VI, camps are not recognized except in few
high-level situations, and even then, not formally - just on a
situational basis. However, it's just rude not to recognize the fact
that someone else was there first, within reason.

That said, if they *ever* have to sit and med/heal while mobs are
still standing, then they can spare some spawn points for others.
