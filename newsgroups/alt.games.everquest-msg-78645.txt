There is a nice pool in North Qeynos.  Not too deep, if you stay out of
the tunnel going down to the sewers, and no pirahna.  The river running
through West and North Karana is nice, as well as the fishing village in
North Ro.  Those spots allow you to swim within a couple of feet of the
shore.  Getting in trouble?  Just point at the shore and run; in seconds
you're standing up again.

Good luck!
