That depends on your server, and what areas you are
looking to buy/sell.

On Xev, I have seen HQ bear go for as little as 10pp and
and as much as 35pp, with 15pp-20pp being most common. HQ
cat might go for as much as 3pp, although 2pp is far more
likely. Other non-ruined cat, wolf and bear might go for
as much as 1pp. Ruined skins are pretty much worthless,
although someone with more cash than sense might pay a
gold or two, if they are just starting out to tailor.
Grizzly bear skins sometimes sell for a few plat, but
they are pretty common drops of the grizzlies in the
Karanas, so my druid tailor just picks them up herself.
HQ lion skins, a very rare drop off of highland lions in
the Karanas, could sell for as much as 50pp (they are
used to make the newly discovered fleeting quivers) but
very few tailors are making them so you might never sell
one.

Now, Xev is an "old money" server (it split from Povar a
while back.) On a virgin server, where EVERYONE is just
starting out, expect prices to be much higher, because
there will be a much higher demand as everyone tries to
be one of the first to make master tailor and corner the
market on tailored backpacks and Wu's armor.
