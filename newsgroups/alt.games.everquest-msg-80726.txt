Mining Pick main hand, Tombcarver off-hand.

12/29 is sorta slow, but it's not THAT much slower than the
Needlite Stinger for an upgrade of 5 damage.  Raw damage
number is the important stat for thos big backstabs.

Tombcarver off-hand because (1) it's fast, which is good for
raising DW skill, and (2) the ratio is better (just by a bit, but
still better) than the Needlite off-hand.

I personally passed on 12/29 piercing weapons until
I got a haste item.  I just did better damage with an 11/22
weapon main-hand.  Sometimes I'd swap 'em out
for the bigger backstabs, though :-).

Good luck to you!
