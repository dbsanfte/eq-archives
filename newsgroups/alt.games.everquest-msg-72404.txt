*Sigh* Beetles in North Karana run slower than normal running speed and are
easily quad kited without snare.  In fact even after getting bonds of force
at level 29 it is not really effecient to snare the mobs you are quadding
until around 36.  You will however need a SoW for levels 20 - 36 (the only
drawback for a new player unable to get Jboots or Tboots for his/her
character)

And all of those zones you mention Wizards can quad kite in.  Any outdoor
zone.  Even after the nerf to The Grey, it is still one of the nicest spots
to quad kite in, as long as you are very careful to kite the Skeletons along
the wall and avoid traps and the such.

Those places are easily soloable by a Wizard also my friend,  however
nowhere near as much benefit as from picking an outdoor zone to Quad kite
in.

Soloing is not like that at high level. Most mobs can fire back making it
much more interesting hehe :)  you find yourself having to use stuns at the
correct times to avoid mobs healing/nuking etc.  There is a lot more
involved than just rooting/blasting.  But anyway, maybe some people enjoy
doing that?
