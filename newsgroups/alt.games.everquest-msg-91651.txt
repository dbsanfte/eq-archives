It may be, if you were close to levelling. In DAOC you lose 10% of the 
experience in your current level. So if you were about to level, you 
lost 1/10 of a level. If you just levelled, you lose nothing. Now, in 
the worst setting, it takes me about 4 hours of grinding to level. So 
I'm losing maximum of about 25 minutes of experience. 
It may be different at higher levels, but that's what it's been so far 
until level 38

I've lost levels. It's more of an insulting thing than inconvenience. At 
times you lose your new ability or spells, which kinda sucks. 
Every now and then when you go exploring or doing strange things 
(recovering all the corpses for a failed raid), you can lose multiple 
levels in a row. That really bites

Sure. It's still hassle though. When I die in DAOC, I either have a 
rezzer in my group, or I was soloing. If I was soloing, I just hit the 
healer near my bind point to get my con back and either go back, or go 
somewhere else. I don't have to return at all

I'm very glad it's changed in EQ. At least as I remember it, it was a 
problem. It may not be a problem any more, but it's still more hassle 
than in DAOC :)
