Thanks for making that decision for me. I hate to tell you if you have
something that interesting to say, then people will be dying to join
your channel. I am so happy you put interesting things in OOC.

I dont think that I should have to filter ooc or put the lot of you on
ignore. I should ask nicely for you to stop, or move it and you
should. OOC isn't used for that.

People use OOC for help. Too many people like you use it for nonsense.
If someone has a question they won't be able to ask it if most
everyone in the zone has it off because selfish people like you are
chattering about interesting things.

I started this thread a while ago and I got the idea it was started
before.

OOC is used for "Out of Character" discussion, and the convention is
quick "Q and A" for OOC and take it to tells or Say. We have made the
vision, if you don't like it lump it. Make a channel and people will
flock to your wisdom.

Out of play nice policies you should have ceased spamming the zone
with yuor chat, and moved it to a channel. You could have done the
same thing in say, where people can move away if they dont want to
hear it.

Auction is for selling. Shout is for emergencies. OOC is for questions
and answers. Say is for anything people want to ask people around
them. Gsay is for your groups chatter, and guildsay is for your guild
chatter.

Chatter in your guild channel. As soon as someone complains about your
chatter in OOC it should stop right there out of politeness.
