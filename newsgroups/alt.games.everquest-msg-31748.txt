Hmm,

I have summed up my thoughts in various replies to replies to my posts... So
without having to reply to all of them, i will state my position and
reasoning plainly in a Singular post that is accessable to all.

    I imagined that since I reply DIRECTLY  under the post/reply that I am
re-replying to(eek headache)
that it would be self explanatory to the person(s) I am replying to, IE: bob
says "why do you eat your pizza folded" then I reply directly to Bob's
Post(branching off from/or IN thread) with "So I can get more of it in my
mouth, I am a pig like that :) " thereby answering Bob, so when Bobbo checks
his posting for a reply, mine is directly under it (in thread) I would think
Bob would have the sense/memory/problem solving skills to know what I was
talking about.
    If it is not "in thread" with Bobs previous post, then I would
definately need to quote him, as it would be a random thread about how i eat
my pizza.etc.. etc..

    That was how I understood the NG threading to work, so as to have an
organized way to reply to other people.

    My aplogies, Since maybe my Newsgroups may and / or must view
differently than some other peoples, I will do my best to redundantly quote
the post I am directly replying to, So as to avoid any further confusion for
those of you whose personal newgroup settings prevent threads to be viewed
in releveancy, and / or a linear fashion.

    Thank you for bringing this mistake to my attention, as I would like
positive input to my "conversations" to be relevantly made without any
trivial space wasted on how many times people can point out the way I post
is to disorienting to be followed.

Again,
Thank you for your continued patience,
Rasha (A.K.A Mitch Case)
