It can be frustrating that's for sure.  I was playing a DE Necro on Luclin
server.  I had a "questionable" name but had been playing it for over two
weeks.  Along came a GM Event, Halflings, I get killed, get my name changed
(not by choice I assure you), then go link dead.  Twenty minutes later I'm
back on.  Of course, no corpse by my new name and because I know exactly
where my "old named" corpse is I go there and it's not there.  I petition ,
then go link dead again.  When I finally get back on again I asked if any
one else had experienced link death.  The response was no.  I haven't
learned the quick ways to make money or level so I'd only made it to LVL 6,
I didn't have a lot but what I did have was hard earned. It was extremely
frustrating.  And not one response to my petitions.  I can't imagine losing
some of the things I've seen the higher levels carrying around to this type
of glitch.  Lost a Paladin in the Plains of Karana the same way.  Petitions
not answered.  Oh well.....
