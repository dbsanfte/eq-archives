i don't think this is the case

i have been having the same problems as the OP just about constantly

however, pre-ldon, i never had problems setting groups up.....the issue then
was that a certain class wasn't showing up in /w all lfg <class> <level
range> .....so we would have to "tour" the zones they might be in (tier 1
for 55+, tier 2 for 60+, seb/velks for 50-55, etc)

so now, with ldon, i think the problem is that there are really TWO games
being played - one for straight up exp, and the other for dungeon crawling

there seem to be TONS more people lfg, but people flake out allllllllllll
the time; and most times, i suspect, it's because they're switching from one
type to the other

not that they're so much different...

but a ldon group seems to be more of a refined group, what with the pressure
and all......sure, sure, the same eggplant-iq people are there, but for
normal groups, a healer, slower, and tank are all that's required to exp

that, or, if this proposal of mine is innaccurate, then let's just say that
ldon attracted more people to playing eq, and they're all idiots =)
