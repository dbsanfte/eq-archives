I don't know about spirocs, but the wyverns in CS do this quite
reliably.  If you are not engaged in actually damaging them in
some way for relatively short amounts of time while they are
low on health, they "pop" back to their spawn sites.

That pop is not a gate.. I've stood on top of them and watched
em do it, never a cast message.  Also, when mobs gate,
they retain their hate list.. this is, in fact, the main reason gating
is universally feared in so many zones.  These mobs will completely
wipe their hate list, they now con normally to you, and anyone who
finishes them off will get the exp, as if you hadn't done 3100 of
the 3200 total.
