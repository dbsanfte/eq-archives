dude start with the basic small gear. get as much ac as you can till 24.
then also get some small 2int rings and i think its 2 int ears. that will
tide you over. i played my gnome till 30 with only 140 int... it ain't that
hard and necros have no down time if they play them selves right.... also
check out this web page necro.eqclasses.com or is it necros... not sure but
check it out
