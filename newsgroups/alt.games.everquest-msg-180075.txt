What makes you think there are "asian" dwarves? This is a different
world. From the map there was no real great geographical isolation
which caused changes in the appearances of groups, other than the
Erudites.

Go and play final fantasy sometime, even their OWN characters don't
look asian at all. One of the F8 and F10 females kind of border on it,
but most anime/video game characters don't look asian in the least.

I think its enough that there is an erudite race (basically humans) as
well as "whiter" dwarves in the form of the coldain. 

Your question is kind of like saying why are there not Black or white
Japanese people? The answer is, because they all lived on a small
island mass together forever.
