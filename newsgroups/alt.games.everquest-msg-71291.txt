Hehe...another thing that is often not considered when dealing with
corporate liability is insurance.  When dealing with product
liability, in many cases it makes sense to place liability based on
what parties can most efficiently anticipate the costs, rather than on
what parties are to blame.

As a society, we've made a decision to not allow people to die in the
streets from random injuries (generally).  This means that if person X
does something stupid that gets themselves seriously injured, we don't
just laugh and watch them die.  We rush them to the hospital and treat
them, which can cost many thousand dollars.

What happens if X can't pay?  The services have been rendered, so
*someone* is going to pay.  Here are some possibilities:

1. The doctor and/or hospital.  They will, or course, raise prices to
cover these kind of loses, so this really ends up being all of us who
use doctors and/or hospitals paying.

2. The government.  This really ends up being all of us who pay taxes.
(And, I suppose, also those who don't, because some of the money will
come from reduced services, rather than increased taxes).

3. *MAKE* X pay.  X doesn't need two kidneys, for instance.  Harvest
one and sell it to cover the medical bills.  I know that several
people on this group are going to say this is the best choice...but
trust me, it ain't gonna happen, so forget it.

4. The manufacturer of the product that X was using.

The case for #4 is that the product manufacturer is in the best
position to predict how many people are going to be injured doing
stupid things with the product, and so can plan ahead for that (e.g.,
buy insurance).  Stupidity is a fact of life, and like any other
natural disaster, the way to deal with it is to anticipate it and
insure against it.
