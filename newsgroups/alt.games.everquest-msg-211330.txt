Unfortunately, I did spend them elsewhere, as I didn't read the fine 
print at the time, and thought that MC1 was sufficient for Cann V.  Were 
I to do that over again, I would have MC3 already, and would have Cann V 
as well now, plus 4 points towards MGB.

I have Malo, Malos and Quiessence are both well out of reach for me, the 
price is way too high, and I have yet to be involved in taking down any 
mobs that drop runes.  I suppose if I did nothing but scrimp and save, 
and farm for cash, I could eventually buy Quiessence, but, I would not be 
gaining much AAXP during that time.  Last I checked Quiessence is still 
going for upwards of 70k on my server.
