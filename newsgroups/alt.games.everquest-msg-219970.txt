To be honest, I never saw that as an advantage particularly, but then, I 
learned to use /loc to navigate, and didn't bother with what SH told me.  
Only reason my SH is at 200 is that I put it with my /loc hotkey.

I have a dwarf, was my first character on EMarr actually, but, I never 
noticed that his sense heading started higher.
