Bizz... you say grow up... you appear to be the childish and impatient
one for anyone who has not absorbed as much info about EQ as you....
Childish.... hmmm...  Yep thats about right childish.

Do you really like to jump someones ass everytime you can?....  
God I wonder if your such an ass in person... and if so what type of
friends you have....  
Dont get me wrong I have a few friends who are Dicks also... and I
still like them...  I guess your about the same as them and Have
tolerant friends...

Drink some coffee... or maybe take a few chill pills... maybe a nap...
How bout the forever sleep in a dirt nap....
hmmmm nice..
