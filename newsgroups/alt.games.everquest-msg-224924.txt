There is no 'strategy' as he is not intended to be killed and hence
not even remotely balanced, once it was seen that RZ COULD kill him
with sufficient zergage the devs could have simply added any number of
abilities making him truly unkillable if they had felt like.  But they
didn't.

The most impressive part of the whole thing for me was several guilds
on a red server managing not to fuck each other over long enough to
get something done.  Even though some did try.
