  Yeah, I never really got this.  It just seems to me like additional
unnecessary spam.  There's really no reason not to assign a MA, so everyone who
know should that is, and you should be assisting the MA by default, so there's
no need to announce anything.

  A simple /assist <tank> social seems like the simplist and best way to go to
me.
