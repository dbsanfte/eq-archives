In beta I was running down a ramp from a building, and went to jump off the 
side near the end. WTF I can't do that ? There was big hole in a wall and 
rather than run around went to climb through over the small lip in front of 
it. WTF I can't do that ? I felt like I had the freedom of movement as that of 
a rat in a maze.

That was the end for me, never bought the game on release.
