You're missing the point.   A cleric's role in a group is primarily
healing, although he has some crowd control (the root line) and
damage avoidance (HP/AC buffs and the stun line) spells.  If
you want to create a group to get XP as fast as possible, you
want to get level-appropriate classes together that can all be
working on killing mobs as fast as possible while taking as little
damage as possible.   Clerics don't fit into the optimal group
for XP because their primary focus - healing - simply shouldn't
be needed at the efficiency a cleric provides *AND* they don't
provide enough other benefits as well as other, sub-optimal
healing classes.

But that's for an "optimal" group in an "optimal" setting for that
group, and that's rarely the case unless it's organized that
way in advance.   Most groups *need* the healing capacity of
a cleric - they're going to take damage that require the cleric's
dedicated healing.   That doesn't change the fact that a group
of six friends can form a group at level 1 (get non-local members
ported and bound by the chosen newbie zone) and level to 50
VERY quickly, even non-twinked, without a cleric in the group
assuming they're familiar with their classes and the game.

IMO, wizards are under-appreciated in groups, but, again
they don't fit the "optimal" group setting very well.  Mana
regeneration doesn't take place quickly enough in "optimal"
groups for the wizard to contribute to every kill.   Again,
that's the theoretical, "optimum" XP group, though.  The
game is rarely like that, and, while a wizard has more problems
finding a group than a cleric or warrior will at most levels,
it's not *that* hard.   One advantage a wizard will have over
a cleric, though, is that he generally can solo better in most
areas while waiting for a group.
