Umm...yeah. Fastest P4 = 2500 Mhz while fastest AMD=~2100 (Intel) Mhz. Real
Clock speed of about 1800, I think. Go visit Tom's "I whore intel cuz they
give me cash" Hardware again. He's consistently shown a heavy Intel bias.

All in all, if ya wanna spend an extra truckload of cash just to say you
have the fastest chip (for a whole month!) then by all means, get a P4. I'll
stick with my much cheaper, yet just as effective AMD. Doesn't seem like a
great use of cash, IMO, bu if that's how ya wanna spend your cash, have fun.
