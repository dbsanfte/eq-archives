Who'se this "we" you're talking about?  Are you voluntarily choosing
to include yourself in with the "more paranoid", as I used the term?
If so, you are doing this by  your own choice, since I did not name
you, nor did I say anything that would include any individuals.

I don't know what you guess, or why.  I think you are once again
confusing what I said with what you want to see.  May I suggest you
make a point of reading more closely?

> Ya know, that makes YOU a bigot.   :^)

Or rather, it would had I said what you claim I did in your deliberate
misunderstanding of my words.  While we are on the subject, however, I
never claimed to be without prejudice or completely unbigotted.
Making a few too many assumption there, bud.  You also have not
defended yourself on my charge of being a bigot.    Did I hit a nerve?
