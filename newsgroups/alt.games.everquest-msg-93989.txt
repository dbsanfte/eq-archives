One minor problem with this one - Alan also confirmed
the 4pet limit when attacking mobs.

I was in a group in FG with Mage, Mage, Mage, Necro - 
and yes, it DID rock :)

The 57 mage had her Decoy pet up, the 54 had his
focused water up, and I (51) had my earth pet up.
The necro was 57.  The mage with the water pet 
usually worked him behind the mob, so I'm pretty
sure it was doing the most damage of any pet on any
given kill (Decoy pet the same level, but lower max
hits).  Our XP was still decent (for 51).

Not sure if that helps, or not, as it has no hard
numbers.
