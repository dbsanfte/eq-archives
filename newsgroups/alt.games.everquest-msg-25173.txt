We can't but, to be honest, many rogues through PP into their evade macro :(

BS.

For the other fellow, rogues do *not* have a taunt skill.  When I've got
it's back, I can attack and *hope* (IF the caster isn't running like a
headless chicken and *allowing* me access to a stationary mob's back) that I
can do enough damage in a short enough time that I will get the mob's
attention.

I can not taunt.  Since I am the one with the Evade skill, my JOB is to try
to stay between the tanks and the casters on the hate list.  Any rogue who
can't learn that skill isn't worth her salt.

Pretty much the same here.  Level 39 and I just got a sweeeeet deal on a
Crys Spear (Can you say backstabs of 240?)  I'm paying off a bit of the debt
on it and then I'll be watching to see how I need to re-manage the agro.
