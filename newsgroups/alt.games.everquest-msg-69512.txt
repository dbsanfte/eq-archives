    Some people have speculated the lack of known boss mobs to kill in SoL
is because of the constant patches - nothing has been given time to spawn
yet. The Lord Inquisitor Seru was found, though.... Nasty Warhammer-looking
guy with a new-graphic sword, a shield made of pulsing flames (think like a
Crystalline Webshield, but with fire instead of white), and the ability to
nail an Eye of Zomm for over 1900 damage in one hit.
