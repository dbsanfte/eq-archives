Yeah fair warning on 3 bucks really means nothing to me. Spend 20
minutes digging change out of the couch cushions and from under
things.

I think from a marketing standpoint verant was very stupid to do it so
close to having Legends with a "premium" price. Or maybe they were
not.. because right now its making more sense to me to pay $39 bucks
for a better game and CS than $12.95 for one exactly the same as
today.
