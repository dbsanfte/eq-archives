Just started soloing in OT at 44 with my new pet...
It is soloing blues, I neither snare nor fear, and the
pet (Intensify Death on it, I must admit) finishes
the fight with 50 health...

I pull a tiger (darkness) and fear, pet, fear -
the tiger goes down before snare wears off (<1.5 minutes)
and it cost me just one bub of mana - less, with medding.

I made 3 blues without any med break in between fights
other than looking for the next mob to kill (all <30sec).

Took the time on 4 blues (then i got too tired):
Almost exactly 40minutes...

And most of the time I just sit there, lifetap once in a while
and heal pet if necessary....
I feel kinda redundant.


Boy - this is awesome....
