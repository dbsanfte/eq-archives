He was red at 46, blue at 51, doesn't summon but has a metric assload of hp
and breaks root very fast, and had an obnoxious habit of jumping me at 30%
mana, he has an INSANE agro range, about as big as the shimmering rockfiends
in the Grey, doesn't see invis though.

It would take far longer to kill him than the mana/time expenditure is worth
in terms of exp, he always drops a few pp and a crappy no drop shield (12
ac, priest class only I think)
