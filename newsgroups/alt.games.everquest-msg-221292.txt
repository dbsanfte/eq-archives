Hi All;

A few months ago I downloaded a Group Window interface. It was simple and
just put the F-keys by the persons name as well as display their hp.
Yesterday I downloaded a Player Window interface. When I /loadskin and
select: Player, it loads the new Player Window just fine, but, it put the
default Group Window back. I then /loadskin and selected Group and it loaded
my group window just fine, but removed the new Player Window and put back
the default. I had use INI selected. So.........since each downloaded UI had
just one file, I put both of these window files (each had different names)
in the same folder. Now when I /loadskin and select Both, they both load and
appear to be fine, however, I get a warning message that says something like
"your xml files are not compatible with EQ and you may have problems with
windows operating normally" or something like that. I still left them both
running and played for hours enjoying both windows and never did experience
anything wrong (at least not that I noticed). Each time I start EQ I get
this error message but things run fine (or so it seems).

Since they both ran fine with no errors when run separately, did running
them together create some kind of problem that will cause me to crash and
burn at some later date?

I know zero about programing so me fiddling with these files will cause my
house to blow up, hehe.

Thank you in advance for your time and any help/suggestions you may have.
