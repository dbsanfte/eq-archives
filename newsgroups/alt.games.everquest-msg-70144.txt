    Root does nothing to remove aggro. It makes the mob unable to get to
you, but it still hates you - even more now because you Rooted it. You have
to rely on Root holding long enough for the tanks to get aggro back from
you. And in my experiences Root just doesn't hold that long.

    So Snare has a low risk of aggro, but you often use Root to stop getting
beat on, huh? 8)

    That's the exact opposite of my recent experiences. Root breaks too
fast - you have to at least also stay standing to avoid keeping aggro.

    I have yet to see a ranger that made high levels and didn't manage aggro
religiously. And here's why: doing Upper Kobolds in Velk's. Most of the
group is level 60, no worries. Plate tank leaves, ranger decides to step up
to the plate and try to tank. He's level 60, in the server's second-best
guild (has his Primal 1HS and other toys), has Aego (no SHM buffs), we have
an ENCH slowing. We had to leave. I had to start my CHeals when he was at
50% health just to keep him alive. I've never seen a main tank of ANY plate
class where I had to start that early. Rangers know how squishy they are,
and use Jolt at the hint of trouble.
