is it just me or is there an incredible amount of beggars in that area?

every friggin time I zone in there I get a /tell from someone begging for
items or plat

i figure its most likely seeing a dark elf zoning in from "probably" what
was a good night in RM and might have some scraps to hand out, but this is
getting old quick

i respond to every /tell of "can joo spare sum moneys for mes?" with "No,
grab a club and kill shit like I had to"

i'm not stingy and am ALWAYS handing out some FS to the lower levels, but
the begging is bullshit
