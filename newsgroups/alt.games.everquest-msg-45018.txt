Suh-weeet? How about suh-uucccks? I see most of these changes as ranging
from pointless to damaging, personally. Specifically:

If your idea is to promote "roleplaying" by saying that people of
different alignments shouldn't be able to engage in trade with each
other, then, ummm, gee, yeah I guess that's a great idea. NOT. It's
perfectly in keeping with roleplaying to allow us trolls to trade with
the spineless goodytwoshoes humans, as long as we get the best end of
the deal. This change looks as if it will try to restrict all player
driven commerce to exchanges inside alignments, at least without some
ludicrous amount of faction/language/alignment work.

As I dont' believe in powerleveling, I guess I'll go along with that
one.

I've long thought there should be less no drop stuff in the game. This
is ok.

So I guess this is the "roleplaying" part, huh?

Can we just call it the race war server instead?

Hey Brad! Whatever you guys are smoking, can you make it available in
game from vendors?

*THUD*.  And the door slams on the new server. A freaking *HUGE* deal
was just made about how Verant was so proud of taking a poll, and
actually listenting to 90% of the players, and scrapping TCC for Luclin,
and now they turn around and implement it on an entire new server.
*THUD*

A deafening silence settles across a number of Kunark and Vellious
zones. What the FUCK were they thinking with this shit? People will need
to bring pictures of Karnor's Castle to the new server, since nobody
will ever see it again.

Not that I was inclined to leave my main, my friends, my guild, etc. and
go start over on another new server anyway, but this really seals the
deal. I wouldn't touch the FV server with a ten foot halbard.
