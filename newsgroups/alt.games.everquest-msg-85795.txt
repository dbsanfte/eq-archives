I wasn't aware you could fall out the water tubes... I recall trying to go
through the side as I was swimming down, but that spinning black thing
seemed to be keeping me in

Also - another use for paladinas : mob positioning.  Mob positioning is
crucial in some cases.... mobs with Ae's, or Yelinak with the water either
side.

When we kill Velketor, a Paladin DA's to move Velk against the wall

As for the DT - chanters are generally my choice to eat it...  tash can't be
resisted, and is gonna get you killed anyway
