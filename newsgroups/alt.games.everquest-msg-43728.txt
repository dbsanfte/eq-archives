Hmm, you can change the background color of the chat box in full screen view.
Maybe try changing it to a color similar to the "half screen" view (since that
color seems to work well for you) but keeping it translucent.  I can't imagine
playing the game in half screen mode... I want my 1280x1024 resolution :)

The command is /wincolor or something...  I can't remember. it's in the help
files though.
