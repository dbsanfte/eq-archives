That is what I am worried about, the total HP.  Luckily most items have
STA and HP, but the problem comes when deciding to choose on over the
other.  As in the example I gave below, knowing the Sta to HP conversion
is important if that decision needs to be made.  The only stats I obsess
over are Str and Dex :)
