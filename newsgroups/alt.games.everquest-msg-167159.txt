The slows didn't not take hold, they just had no apparant effect.  Chanter
did his 50% slow initially, first run, based on his experience which was pre
fix, where slows higher than 50% did nothing.  When that had no effect he
tried higher level slow.   Second run, he started with higher level slow,
then 50% slow, then he said he even tried a lower % slow than that.  Paladin
(only one to get hit by the boss at all, yay pally aggro) said no difference,
and I can attest that pally HP dropped at a consistent and alarming rate...
and that the boss chewed thru me faster than he did on any of my few previous
meetings with him save the one where the shaman tried slow, got resist, got
killed, before we'd managed a thing (oh and the warrior had been rezed during
wave four and barely had any buffs, to add to the fun)

Its possible that he was casting the wrong spell somehow, but its also
possible that this latest patch screwed up slow for mobs that have the new
slow mitigation, again.
