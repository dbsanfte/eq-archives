I'd like to hear this too - compared to Ice and Wind boss in BoT, for
instance, or Guardian of the Seal in the new Hole.

It is, isn't it?  So much so that we are getting together regular
18person raids in the morning to complement our regularly scheduled
guild raids.

Ice and Wind bosses drop easily to our 18 people, we're 1 for 5 on
the lightning boss with 3 groups.  We're 2 of 2 on Guardian of the
Seal, although the first one was messy.

We are definitely interested in more targets for 3 groups, usually
3 clerics and a couple druids for healing.  Average level is usually
64.
