And a hearty "fuck you" to you, Sang.

It's reasonable for them to tweak the spell so that
a sufficiently high "N" of Paladins can't trivialize a
raid.  It's *not* reasonable for them to remove it entirely,
and Paladins are justified in complaining that it has been
nerfed into total oblivion.  You're way out of line to
suggest that anyone should be "kicked in the balls" for
griping about it.

What Verant should have done instead was make it work like
the adjustment that was made to the similarly problematic
Cleric BP -- turn it into a debuff which lasts for a period
of time and blocks anyone else from casting it until it
wears off.

For example, casting ToK could put a 20 second debuff on
a mob, the first 6 seconds of which would be the useful
"silence" period, and the remaining 14 seconds would
simply serve to give a "your spell did not take hold"
message to anyone else trying to cast it until it wore
off.

Problem solved -- 99 Paladins would not be able to
silence a mob any more than one would.  The most that
*any* number of Paladins would be able to do would
be to block 6/20ths of a mob's casting.  That would
be extremely useful, and make Paladins desired on
raids, but not trivialize the fights.
