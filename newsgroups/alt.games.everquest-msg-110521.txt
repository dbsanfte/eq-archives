This is a good idea  and the whole port idea is great.  If they do this to
replace boats I hope they will add a few other ports to help us earth-bound
melee types travel a little faster. Right now my options for a long run are:
    1. Run for 30 minutes across six zones
    2. Spend 10 minutes begging for a sow (spend 5pp)-then run for 20
minutes across six zones
    3. spend 20 minutes begging for a gate (spend 10 pp)-then run for 10
minutes running across two zones

Ok I know thats an exaggeration, but it sure would be nice to have some
ports, cuz my feet are really starting to hurt.
