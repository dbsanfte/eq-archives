And would be quite difficult... quests that are virtually impossible for 
a full group of 35th level players with a month of factioning under 
their belt are trivial for a single 12th level enchanter of any race.

Correct. And keeping track of which quests you have completed is a large 
amount of data. Keeping track just of how many quests you've completed 
is exploitable. I have completed 'thousands' of quests when factioning...

The idea has a great deal of merit, but it won't happen in EQ1. IF the 
quests were much larger and interconnected, and parts couldn't be 
skipped, then it would be possible to reach various thresholds that 
would be easily flaggable for an item like this.  (Sort of like 
'completing an epic flag'), but they aren't.
