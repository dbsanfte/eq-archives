When you die in DAoC, you lose a certain amount of XP, and leave a
corpse, and your point-of-view is left over the corpse.  While in that
state, if you get a res, you come back to life suffering from
resurrection sickness, and low on health and power, but with no other
ill effects.  The XP loss is the only permanent penalty in this case.

If, while in the "waiting over corpse" state, you type "/release" or
10 minutes passes, you return to your bind point, with all your stuff,
and a gravestone is left behind where your corpse was.  You lose some
more XP and 3 points of constitution, and get resurrection sickness.
If you visit an NPC healer (there is usually one near each bindable
area), your resurrection sickness will be cured.  For a fee, the NPC
healer can restore constitution points.  If you make your way back to
your gravestone, target it, and type "/pray", you will recover the XP
that was lost by releasing.  You do not get back the XP that was lost
immediately upon dying.

If you die again on the way to your gravestone, and release, the new
grave replaces the old one, so you don't get to leave gravestones all
over the world.

The penalties are modified by several factors:

1. You can't lose enough XP to lose your level.

2. First death in the level has 1/3 the XP and con loss.  Second death
has 2/3 the XP and con loss.

3. No XP (or con, I think) loss below level 6.  At 6, the XP loss is a
very small percentage of what is needed for the level.  At 7, the
percentage goes up a little, and up some more at 8, and so on, until
around level 10 or 12 (I forget which), and then stays a constant
percentage from then on.
