I know it happens to quite a few in game, but in some zones, POK, Arcstone, 
Temple of Solro, Guild Lobby but not Guild Hall for a few.

When i look due West at a the level vision setting, the screen doesnt pick 
up the all graphics. I can see spells particles and flames etc, but the 
whole surroundings go AWOL and sort of "blank".

The do re-appear though, if stop looking west.

Any ideas as to how its caused?
How I can stop it?
Or any links to any help forums on the subject?

Thanks
