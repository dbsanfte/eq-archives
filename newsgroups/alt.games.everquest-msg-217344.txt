If you want your EQ character to be able to move to EQ 2 as a
first level newbie with no exp, no loot, nothing at all, well how
hard is that? 

For most characters, this will be as easy as making a character
with the same name, race, and class.

There are apparantly a few races/classes that won't exist
anymore, so there are perhaps a few that can't make the move that
easily, but for the rest, its just a question of your grabbing
the name before someone else on your server gets it.
