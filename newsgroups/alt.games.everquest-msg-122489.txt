Do you have any evidence of this, or is it just your own personal
experience?

My own personal experience is that people are people, regardless of
the way speak, how well educated they are, or who they know.  And I've
met plenty of giant assholes who don't speak in a 'profane' manner at
all.

Me, I cuss like a sailor and I haven't been in a fight since I was in
eight grade and I generally can't stay mad even when I should.

Frankly, my first rule is to avoid people who even worry about being
in a 'better class'.  Might be a bit blue collar of me, but I dislike
people who put on airs.
