Ruby Crown? Damn, I gotta get over to WK.

In terms of other things you can do with it, no, not really, nothing besides
selling it.  It's what is referred to as a cash item, and the only time I've
seen one is when I was awarded it in a Cleric roll in the Plane of Fear
because of the cost of Peridots on the symbols we use.  So go ahead and feel
free to sell it.

On a side note, it's nice to see that some things are taking place that make
the world varied and interesting.
