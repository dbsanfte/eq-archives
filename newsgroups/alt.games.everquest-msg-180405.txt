I'll probably do the Melee version.  The idea of having the same pet for 10 
levels is frightening during the last couple levels.  Then again, I'll be 
grouping at that point, too, so I guess it doesn't matter too much.

>Weapons:

>Piercing for Emerald Skinning Knife (Summons lvl/4 Bandages as proc)

Ah, great.  I was hoping that I would not just be using H2H.  I have a few 
of the other bandage summoning knives, so I'll hand one of those over.

Thanks for the info.
