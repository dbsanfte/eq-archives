In other words you want to completely ignore a theme. That's logically 
just silly. AP is like a managed dkp system... and you want to get your 
Elemental Drops by putting your time in at PoN. At some point you have 
to *go* to PoF to get your PoF drops, even if you spend dkp that you 
largely earned elsewhere.
