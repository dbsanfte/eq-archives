You know, I tend to use emoticons a lot, maybe even to the point of over-
using. When I put a smiley at the end of a sentence, what I mean by it 
is straightforward: "I'm typing this with a smile on my face".

I'm picturing someone typing the sentences above with a smile, and it's 
making my skin crawl...
