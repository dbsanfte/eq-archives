1. The Internet "bubble" burst before GWB took office. Anyone with
half a brain saw it coming in 1998. The poor economy is not the fault
of Bush or Clinton. It all runs in cycles. The best a seated President
can hope to do is nothing when things are going good, and small
adjustments to stimulate things when the cycle turns down.

2. 9/11 had a devastating effect on the economy, and nothing could
have been done to prevent that.

3. I just refinanced my house, and the interest rate dropped from
5.375% to 5.0% in the last week and a half. Rates have not been this
low in 40 years. Housing prices in my area are up 20-30%, and the
local builders can't keep up with the demand. Now you come along...a
boy genius...and delcare that rates are going up. Really profound
observation there.

4. The "hike" in gas prices is more related to market panic, gouging,
political problems in Venezula, and most recently reductions in output
by Kuwait  than anything else. In truth there is more than enough oil
in the "pieline" to cover these events. Unfortunately the market
responds quicker than the actual supply changes.

5. The proposed Tax cuts have not been put into effect. Therefore it
is foolish to blame them for the current state of the economy.

6. All economic indicators show that we are on a steady recovery. The
"left" and thier media accomplices will hide this fact for as long as
possible (hopefully until the 2004 election) in order to discredit the
current administration.

Get it?

Where did you study economics? The "Bush" plan is not something he
pulled out of his ass. It was put together by a team of economists.
Right or wrong the plan needs to be tried before it can fail (or
succede)

Based on what?

Pardon my "french" (and the pun), but 'Fuck the rest of the world (and
the gutless UN). Most of the nations against the war either have
contracts with Iraq worth billions or are not targetted by the current
regime. The same pinheads that refused to mandate SH's removal in '91
leaving us in the mess we have today.

France. Russia and Germany have strong economic ties to Saddam
Hussien. They are acting purely in self interest (which is their right
as a sovereign nation). Their position is biased, and I for one do not
believe for a second that they have the best interests of anyone but
themselves at heart.

You would have to pull your head out of your ass before attempting to
kick anything.

Everything you accuse Bush of doing, old "blow-job" Billy was doing in
the oval office. "America" didn't seem to care then, so why should it
matter now? Amazingly enough Billy boy still found enough time to sell
out the country to the Chinese and ignore the North Korean and Al'Qeda
threat until it was too late. Leaving a stained dress, and a
redefinition of "is" as a legacy.

Bush may not be the best President to ever serve this nation, but he
is far from the worst.
