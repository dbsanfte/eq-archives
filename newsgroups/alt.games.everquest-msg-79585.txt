No I think it would be appropriate that Rangers could stand off and fire
arrows for either more damage or a faster rate so as not to have to
melee...alt a class that does this and leave rangers as they are.
If you have ever seen a bow user in DAoC it makes much more sense, to me
anyway...I don't believe they should match the likes of Monks, Rogues or
even a well equipped Warrior but why not have them stand back as a caster?

Depends who's idea of ranger you look at, Aragorn was a Ranger, Drizzt was a
Ranger both are more swordsman then bowmen... Legolas, hmmm is he classed as
a Ranger? Robin Hood? he was, by what little true history there actually is
of him, an Archer/Long Bowman who was in the Kings service at one point.

Oh look, someone has seen LoTR one too many times (if that is possible)

I have thought this for some time since seeing DAoC hunters and the like.
They were actually nerfed at one point for being too powerful but still play
and effective part in the group just standing back and using archery.

Maybe, rather than up the rangers defensive skill they should have upped the
archery damage they could do and given them a natural or spell based haste
bonus to using bows (or something)

This guys post to whatever forum comes from seeing Legolas on film, stabbing
orcs in the eye with his arrows etc.

The bow is an ineffective weapon in EQ and I believe that should have been
addressed long ago but it hasn't and I doubt it ever will.

Remember, the characters in fellowship of the ring would be characters over
50 in EQ terms...hmmm, although they send the Wizard to tank the Balrog, ok,
maybe they are newbies ;ï¿½)
