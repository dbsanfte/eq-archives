Those who follow the news of EQ2 closely are aware of something that the
average person playing EQ-L is not...that these two games are very
different games.  It is taking a while for some folks to get it through
their heads that EQ2 is NOT just EQ-L with a fancier graphics engine, and
in the process some unnecessary but passionate diatribes have occured
("EQ2 has no CH and all priests can rez?! OMGZ CLERICS WILL SUK!!!!1!!!1")

I have also noticed that there is a good portion of the EQ-L community
that was not, is not, will-never-be interested in EQ2. Just so there are
many EQ2 fanboys who want nothing to do with EQ, and in fact think it is
their own personal version of hell-on-earth.  

While the joy and love that would come from watching these two factions
play together in a.g.e. does give me a giggle, I find that as an EQ2
fangirl, I'm honestly rather not interested in wading through subjects to
find the ones that interest me about MY game.  And likewise it might be
like that for EQ-L players once EQ2 is off and roaring.

So.  Where does a person go to talk to the gods of usenet to find out how
to request a new newsgroup?  If it is anything like starting a guild,
where you have to have large masses of people, are there any other lurking
EQ2 fangirls and boys who might be interested in helping me get this place
set up?  

Not that I don't forsee a small bit of cross-posting...
