   Ok, this makes me just a smidgen jealous of life on bluebie servers,
I admit.  Well, it's part of the charm of the place, I suppose.  But
this raises an interesting question to me.  What zone, other than the
planes of hate and fear, are the furthest away or hardest to get to a
PoP portal?  This is interesting to me because now all of my characters
are bound in the PoK, and I don't foresee changing that anytime soon.
