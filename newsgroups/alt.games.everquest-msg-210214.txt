No, not mine.  I'm not fessing up to anything.  But if you want to read
about someone who did, you might want to go to the Firiona Vie board
here:

I guess it could wrap.  Anyways, this guy confesses to scamming
thousands of dollars worth of equipment and characters from a few
different servers (FV, Bristlebane, Legends, Tallon Zek if I understood
it right) over the period of years.  In the end, he blames EQ for
ruining his life.  He does name names and stuff. I found it to be an
interesting read.  Long, rambling, and more than a bit incoherant, but
still interesting.
