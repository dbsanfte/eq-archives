There's a page somewhere at www.microsoft.com that lists what's new in
DX 8.1.  There is some signficant stuff there.  However, I have
trouble believing Verant is actually using the new stuff, since they
switched from 8.0 to 8.1 pretty late...no way would they have had time
to properly test the 8.1-only features.
