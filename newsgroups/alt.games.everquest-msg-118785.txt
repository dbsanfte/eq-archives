Hi there ... my suggestion is to find a Necro and pay them well.  The best
thing for you to do is go through Eastern Wastes zone to Kael amd then to
the WL zone ... get the Necro to summon the corpse from that zone line which
is well away from Wooshi. Of course invis all the way.
If your faction is bad for Wooshi kill Dire Drakkel wolves and Frost Giants
until it improves.
regards
@ndrew
