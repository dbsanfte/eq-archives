I've seen plenty of both examples, thank you. The situation he
described was a train. A berserking gnoll (frenzying on someone) would
add to the train. The linkdead player would chase him. Thats one
possibility. Another is he was kicking the hell out of the gnoll and
IT ran. Again, the player would chase him.

I have won fights while linkdead, and found myself quite some distance
away because the running mob managed to get a fair distance before
being taken down.

Btw I have also seen linkdead players chasing mobs in ToV all the
time, especially inexperienced players who try to /q when a pull goes
wrong and aeing mobs appear.

Some of those were bitches to recover.
