  Raw silk, and prices will vary.  Generally 1pp per AC at the high end...
sometimes only around 2pp per article, or 4pp for the "bigger" articles that
require two swatches (raw silk is tailored).  Also, if you already haven't,
get yourself a Senior Apprentice's Robe in your guild... it's probably the
best chest protection you're going to be able to afford for a while unless
somebody is generous and gifts you with a bunch of platinum or something
nicer.
