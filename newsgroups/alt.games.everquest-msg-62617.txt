Things are going my way lately.  Last night I popped into S Ro to camp the
clops (for the first time I might add).  There was only one other person in
the zone and to be honest with you I didn't ask if he was camping it.  A
buddy and I started killing everything in sight and after 5-10 minutes he
popped.  We beat him down, got the ring and headed off to the commons for
shadowed rapier.  In 20 minutes we get the rapier, stopped off at the bank,
and ran to Rathe.  When I zoned into Rathe from Feerot who do I see but
Hasten Bootstrutter.  I hail him a couple of times, give him the stuff, and
I've got my boots.

Glad I didn't blow the 5K on travelers boots or muti-quest.  Annd yes I know
I got lucky.
