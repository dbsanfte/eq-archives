I was going to back up my charactername.opt files today, but there are none.
My hotkeys and socials in-game are still there.  I have reinstalled the game
since the new UI came out, so can anyone confirm that hotkeys are stored in
a different type of file with the new UI?  There are UI_charactername.ini
files, but it only seems to be the window positions and settings, i. e. I
could not find my socials in those files.  However, I didn't spend a great
deal of time searching through these files.  Am I missing something obvious
here?  (It wouldn't be the first time)
