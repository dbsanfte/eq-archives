What a Joke!!

The Lakers have not improved the image of the NBA or any other sports
league.  They are a bunch of rude, arrogant punks who have no respect for
the game or the people who made it possible for them to play in the NBA.
Shaq is more concerned about trying to rap then trying to learn how to shoot
a free throw.  They are not the greatest team in history nor will they be!
They do not repeat NOT represent the hopes and dreams of an entire nation!
Also No One wants to live in LA and I would hardly rank Shaq as one of the
most intelligent people in the nation.  He can barely speak English!

I hate watching the Lakers play and in fact most NBA teams these days!
There is no CLASS in the NBA just a bunch of rich gangster wannabe's.  It is
disgusting how they Lakers acted in they won.

If you want to proud of a championship team that displayed grace, class,
respect and pride in winning you should look at the Colorado Avalanche!!
They are a team that could represent hopes and dreams.  They came together
as a team respecting the game and respect past champions.  The first person
to raise the Stanley cup was 22 year veteran Ray Bourque!  Between games
they did not resort to childish immature name calling ala Shaq.

As far as I'm concerned, the NBA is dead and gone are the teams and players
you could admire and look up to such as the Jordan's, Bird's, and Johnson's.
