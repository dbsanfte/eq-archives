Yeah, that would be boring, but how about if it was something like Tigole's
rants?  When Tigole was running the Legacy of Steel site, the front page was
essentially his blog, and usually contained interesting observations on EQ,
especially on balance issues, both at the uber end, and for ordinary people.
Tigole had enough good ideas and insight that he's now doing that stuff
professionally, working on World of Warcraft.

Or consider some of the longer posts here from Lance, or that Cleric whose
name I forget who posts about what his uberguild is doing?  Those would both
work well in a blog.
