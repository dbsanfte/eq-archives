Oooooh, I have a level 65 spell.  Only one I'm likely to get
anytime soon, now that the level 65 runes only drop in Plane of
Time. (j/k)

Happens its part of the Lull line, which would make me scream if
it weren't for the fact that they largely repaired the Lull line
recently so its actually useful.

Working the OC camp in POV, I was able to reliably single pull
tree frogs with it.  Oooh.

Then I went to POI.. and got Unaffected messages on everything.
Bard stepped up and said she'd try... same thing.  She swore two
weeks ago she'd had no trouble but now, no dice.

One source said you need to be no more than 5 levels under the
mob's level.  Well I'm 65 and the mobs in question are cyan to
me.  Another said that each lull  line spell has level limits...
well again, this is a level 65 spell with (I'm told) a level 65
cap... sure as Brell those Cyan to me mobs aren't over 65!

I"m sure some mobs are deliberately tagged as non-lullable.  And
I appreciate the message, particularly since I don't have to wait
out the spell cast duration or spend the mana to find out.

Anyone have a list of those mobs?

Its annoying to find an entire zone (and a low level one at that)
immune to my mighty cleric pulling tool... but I'll suffer along,
after all for at least 60 levels the entire line was useless
everywhere!
