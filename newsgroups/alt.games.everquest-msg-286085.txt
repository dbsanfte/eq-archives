The majority of players went bonkers over TBC.  The 60-70 leveling
experience was incredibly rich.  I'm not sure who's complaining about
grinding that wasn't already.  It's much less of a grind, and the
grinds that do exist are better disguised.  A ton of content was put
in, and it was pretty damn fun from what I could tell.  And everyone
was gushing over it for the first 2 months.

The only part of the playerbase that I've seen really want to choke
Blizzard is the high-end raiding scene, which is likely about 8% of
the playerbase.  It's a pretty good idea not to judge WoW by the
official forums.  That place is a cesspool of complainers and has been
for a long time.  If one only read the official boards, he'd very soon
decide that WoW was horrible, people were cancelling in droves, and
the game was on the verge of collapse.
