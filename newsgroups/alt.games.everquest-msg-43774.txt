ok, new warrior,
several pieces of advice

first play the tutorial, especially redo it once after you try playing
second - RTFM - not the paper one, but the file in the EQ folder, lots of
excellent help there

and in this particular issue, right click the item on the vendor and hold
mouse button down, displays stats on items

hope this helps
