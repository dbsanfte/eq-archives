Those people are just 'turboing' through the part of the game where that 
works. Once they've bought the best they can find in the bazaar and 
ground out 65 or so levels, they will be at the point where the only 
upgrades are no drop -- AND THEY WANT THAT STUFF.

That is the whole entire reason they bought the best they could buy in 
the bazaar, and ground out 65 or 70 levels. It was so they could play 
the game where the only upgrades are no drop.

You take away the items, put them in a store, and NOBODY will be happy.
