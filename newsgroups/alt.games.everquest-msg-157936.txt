"That and the fact that you just got a cheal spell in addition"

You know I don't see where you get this idea at.. druids did get 75% heal or
aprox 2900Hp at LEVEL58!!!
clerics get complete heal or 7500HP at LEVEL 39!!

so.. whats so great about that? they are considered a healer class
somewhat.. espically on big raids.. when the clerics go out of mana in the
middle of a big fight.. will you be whining then when the druid heals you to
save your butt for 2900HP?

and most druids don't charge too much for a port.. at least I don't, If I'm
not busy I will usually take you where ever you want.. for a donation.. and
a donation is whatever you want to pay.. either 100pp or 1gold.. it is just
being considerate of a druid that has to take you somewhere.

me.. being a druid.. I am not whining about my spells .. I like them very
much.. very happy with what i have... if you want it.. create a druid=)
