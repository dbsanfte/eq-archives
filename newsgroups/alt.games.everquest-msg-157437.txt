Blessing of Piety and Blessing of Faith are vendor buyable spells
in the PoK

After playing around with them for a while I finally figured out
they function like spell haste focus items, giving roughly a 10%
boost to spell casting time on spells that cast in 3 seconds or
longer with the usual exception of CHeal.

Castable on others, this would seem like a nice utility added to
the class to help make them desirable in groups... except that
the duration seems to be very long, so its just as likely to turn
people into buff beggers instead.

At any rate, the buff does stack with all the other cleric buffs
I could find to cast on myself, plus one stacks with the other
for some unknown reason; I can't see why.  I assume BoF works on
spells up to level 39, and BoP works on all spells (or maybe just
ones up to 60) like focus items, but if thats so then why not
have BoP overwrite BoF and BoF not cast on someone if they
already have BoP.

I can think of one benefit to this actually, BoF is now an
utterly worthless buff I can put on to protect my real buffs in a
dispeller fight, in addition to buffs for whichever resist isn't
being checked in that fight.  Since it stacks with BoP, I can put
that buff further down the ladder where it won't be killed

At any rate, I still have questions: Does this stack with worn
focus items?  Does it stack with mage made worn focus items?  If
not, are they deliberately trying to keep clerics out of uber
groups (whose members will have the focus items already) and even
more so, seperate them from their mage buddies with a fire hose?
First they kill mod rods(for all intents and purposes), then they
give us a buff thats useless with a mage handy... (if thats what
they did)
