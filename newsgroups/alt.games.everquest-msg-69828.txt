There's one, from Scientific American.  There's tons more online,
though.   A simple search will show thousands.   It's generally
accepted that, by today's standards, dinosaurs were warm-blooded,
although not to the sophistication that mammals developed (or any
other modern warm-blooded animal did, for that matter.)   Early
theories simply assumed they were cold-blooded, due to similarities
with today's reptiles.   Investigation of the fossil record has shown
that be be a rush to judgement, while it's likely the truth is somewhere
in the middle.

It's usually not wise to attack someone's scientific knowledge without
doing at least some basic research.
