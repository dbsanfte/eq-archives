    Screaming Terror on adds. Short-term mez spell, you should be able to
keep up to two mobs locked down with it at once. If you're moving a lot
(fear kiting), then you'll likely Screaming Terror, move with pet, then
Screaming Terror again when the mob breaks and comes after you. In outdoor
zones where once things get out of distance they don't come after you (like
in Kunark), you can just Fear adds - but this can really backfire long-term.
You also have an undead-specific Root spell at your level.

    At level 31 your regular nuke is quite strong. Usual cleric tactics are
to Root and Nuke. The only problem is finding a nice place where the mobs
are low blues.
