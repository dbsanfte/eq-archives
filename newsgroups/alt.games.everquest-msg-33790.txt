Seriously I prefer topposting when it's a small subject (like this). Makes
reading the thread a lot faster. I also always assume that there are no
comments between the quoted text if it's a top post which, again, makes
reading and skimming through posts a lot faster.

Just make sure you delete most crap to reduce download amount for the modem
users among us :)


ps. There are also some newsreaders (mainly specific versions of OE), which
make top almost obligatory or they screw up your remarks.
