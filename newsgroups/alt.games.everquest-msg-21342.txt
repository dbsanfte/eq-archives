I'm a cleric, and today was really bad. Pullers, if you take off
before I can heal you and the sow runs out, or you overpull, you are
going to die. And if I can run to you and heal you it means you are
cutting in to my medding time. Pull to the group, make sure you are in
range, and if you are down to a quarter health wait for a heal.

Thanks for letting me vent.
