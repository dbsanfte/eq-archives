I think druid would be a much better addition.  HP buff that stacks with the
shaman's, much better snare than a wiz with only slightly lesser powered
nukes, plus "set it and forget it" dots, basically the same ports/evacs, and
extra healing power to boot.  Basically gives you everything the wizard
does, plus.
