thank you for to the trouble of finding a citation which pertains to the
question on hand.  I do appreciate it.

Do you have the real name for Blanche Poubellle - surely it's a psuedonym as
all I can find her writing for is the Gay magazine, the guide, and with a
name like that writing for the guide, someone has a sense of humour :)

Coming from such a source, which I am sure you'd agree, it merits both
reading and checking for accuracy as slants on perceived persecution could
be expected, deliberately or otherwise.

Firstly I note that no etymology of pussy used in this way is directly
described.

Secondly her/his etymology for wimp surprised me.  It certainly sounded so
straight forward that it must be right.  But I'd long held that it had
originated from Whimpey - Popeye's friend (a long story).  I checked wimp
and found a reference to Whimpey and whimper in etymologies as roots for
wimp but none of wimp being used as a term for women leading to it being
used for men, so it would seem that Blanche is incorrect in this fact.  I'd
guess she's correct in the other "fact" she presented - "sissy" which makes
him/her 50% correct at best.

Given this I think we can rule out this magazine article on the grounds of
inaccuracy and being non-authorative.


But, it was not a wasted piece of research - fortunately research seldom is.

In checking some of these things out it is interesting to note that "pussy"
was used as a term of endearment for females from the late 14th century and
at least in Beecher Stowe's (Uncle Tom's Cabin, mid 19th century) it was
still being used as a term of endearment.  From this it can reasonably
deduce that the way "pussy" is now used as a term to mean the vagina is
relatively new, and being used derrogaively to mean "woman" is hence newer
than as a vagina.  The point of interest is that  "pussy" was also used for
effeminate men from the time it was first known to be used as a term of
endearment for women (mid-late 14th century).  This clearly supports the
opinion that "pussy" as used to describe a coward has no relevance to a
vagina. It also supports claims by those posters who said that "pussy" could
be used in an endearing way.

Contrary (or supporting depending how you look at it) to both arguments is
another slant that it migh come from the French "le chat" which apparently
has a double meaning of both cat and genital! Someone like Babe might be
able to help on this possibility.

Come on, you  know I've never heard them described as a vagina either.

well hopefully what I found will resolve this.  What say you?
