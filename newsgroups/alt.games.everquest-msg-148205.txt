Bloodgimp Goblins in LoIO; about 1000-1200 hp each, however they spawn
underwater, so it takes a little practice to get them pulled since they
can't single be pulled w/o harmony til 47, harmony takes too long if you're
pulling a quad.  I always just snared one of a pair, then hit esc and swam
halfway to next spawn pair, then tank the second gob while I snare it,
repeat for the second set of 2, then run to shore (they'll mostly group up
by the time you get to shore) and nuke.  Just be sure not to run too far
ahead of them while they're snared since they'll give up and go home (I had
good luck by only tapping forward movement, so I'd go about half speed.)
Decent loot, great exp, I could do a quad of them on about half a bar of
mana at 45.
