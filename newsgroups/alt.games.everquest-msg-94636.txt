Speaking of gate potions, has anyone found one that works in Veeshan's 
Peak yet?  Sometimes RL intrudes and you need to get out quicky, and VP is 
a zone in which that just isn't possible.  Paying 1000pp would be 
preferable to stopping the entire raid while I make corpses inside and 
out, get a cleric to my bind point, and then rez in and out.
