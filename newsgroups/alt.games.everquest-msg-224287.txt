There's an amazing amount of mythology that surrounds LDoN, like the "lowest
level goes in first" thing. Last night I grouped with a group leader who
said that we were going to do a slaughter "because they provide the most
experience".  Go figure that one out.

If I had been more observant, I also would have noticed that this level 49
warrior was wearing all leather, and that the Wizard that came with him only
moved or talked when he wasn't moving and talking. The Warrior wasn't
kicking if the Wizard was casting and the Wizard wasn't casting if the
Warrior was kicking. I don't think he ever once taunted and I wound up with
most of the aggro all night. We had an Enchanter in the group, too, but the
Warrior continued to insist on having our Cleric pacify mobs in a room to
avoid 2-pulls... Yes, we all died and yes, he and the "Wizard" are both on
my list.
