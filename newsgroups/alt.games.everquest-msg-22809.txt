Hee hee I knew I would end up saying.

Spoiler space if you want to keep guessing...
















http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1261

The trick is to bind at the centaur village,
Get the bread (2gp)
Port to NK,
Run NW dodging giants griffins and lions
Get to Innkeeper James (with Sow the run takes about 2 mins)
Give him the bread.
Gain 1 - 3pp and xp *
Gate
Rinse repeat.

* at level 21 my halfling druid got almost a blue bubble per loop.
I could do 3 loops in about 12 mins, and then would need to med to full.

Even without ports it is worth doing provided you have Sow or are a
bard.

I did one yellow into 20 to ding 22 in about 5 hours and I was not going
as fast as I could. Oh I also made about 50pp in this time, enough to
pay for the level 19 spells that I could not pay for before.

I'm a halfling so I get the xp bonus, but a friend with a 30 + elf druid
said that he was "Getting noticeable xp much safer that fighting"

Look for this going next patch.

Jim
