    Interesting indeed.  Of course, just like CoH, creative griefers will
still find a way to gank the unsuspecting.  Still, I think this is the
right move for them to take.  PvP in EQ has not been terrible successful. 
Just a handful of nearly deserted servers.  They probably wish they hadn't
introduced the first PvP server at all.

   That's possible, I guess.  But I don't know that PvP is that big a part
of EQ now, or that it ever will be.
