Play more than one - make sure its one with a good newbie yard - dont play
in Kelethin the awkwardness of the platforms is enough to put off a
computer game newbie when combined with a EQ newbie

For specific selection the first character needs a balance of her choice
and your guidance - dont push one class her way. If its a bad choice
phrase it as its not going to work long term (after all lvl 1-5 is pretty
similar an experience).

Class I imagine work well - 

Cleric - less downtime and so you get action. Plus the chance to interact
with others. Has the longest term prospects too.

Ranger - a decent soloist and somethig you can go play on your own if you
want

Shaman - Always one I think works well for 20 levels or so combining
spells and combat but not hugely reliant on either.

SK - for those who like the darker side of life - for much the same
reasons as the ranger. When you hit level 9 both those classes become
interesting - but Im sugesting a trot through levels 1-5 to start.

Monk - One of the easiest to explain to a non fantasy oriented person
I think. Some abilties to work up and they come in at a rate that allows
you to guide them through the whole hotkey and ability use options without
the mess and expense of spells.

Ones I would stay well clear of are 

Warrior - for a newbie I think the monk works better as an intro very
early on, its got the perception to a newbie of being one dimensional and
if stuck too generally requires non occaisional players.

Bard - RSI - need I say more, its horribly complex to explain, it
difficult to play.

Rogue - Nothing it does really intros you to the game as well or as
quickly as the classes above and the skills just take a while to generate
a use (IMO). Good class but not an intro class.

As to the others, the pure int casters, the pally and the druid - there
are others with a better flavour to show what that class does in the short
term introduction so Id suggest the others unless one of those
particularly appeals to the newbie in question in that case go with it.

Once you get beyond having tried a couple of ideas then its free for all
on whatever has appealed in play so far.

Race can either be the major or the minor concern. If its the major (ie I
wanna play that) then you simply suggrst classes within that restriction).
If its minor pick the class and go with the best newbie yard of the class.
Generally avoid Iksar Id say, and possibly nightblinds as well.
