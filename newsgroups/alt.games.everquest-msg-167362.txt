Nah, don't bother.  I made do plenty easily without sow since I hit level 5
with my bard.  At 49 you will get a great upgrade to selo's.  It lasts 2.5
minutes.  Fire it up once, kite a few things, then refresh.  My main EQ
buddy plays a druid.  I like going places with her when she won't drop her
sow (out of paranoia) because I just run circles around her while she's
*speeding* along.
