Setting prices, by the way, means

Click on an item in your trader window.

Click on PP, set an amount.  (repeat with gold, silver, copper... but
almost noone bothers), click accept

Click on Set Price

Click on Add.

Any number of times I've screwed up one or another of these simple
steps, and ended up repricing an item other than the one I wanted, or
failing to set a price at all for the item I'm trying to sell, or
setting up a price... but not offering it to the public!

Oh, you also need to make sure you are in an actual vendor area,
although the game itself will mention this if you aren't.
