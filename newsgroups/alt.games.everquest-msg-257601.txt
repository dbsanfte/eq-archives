Leapfrogging is definately a kill steal in any pragmatic sense. But yes, 
according to the very narrow SOE pnp leapfrogging isn't the offense that 
kill stealing is.

An ebay like player rating system would be interesting to see 
implemented in an mmrpg, and would probably keep players a lot more 
honourable, and make those that aren't a lot more identifiable.
