1) Import her into EQ then blame Verant?

2) Import her into EQ then let her loose in N Ro?

3) Import her into EQ and make her your slave making spider or spiderling
silk to combine into silk threads (2 spiderling silks) or silk swatches
(spider silk)?

4) Import her into EQ then repeatedly kill her and make yourself go crazy
from the sound effects of her (a spider) dieing?

5) Call Verrant tech support and ask them. (I can laugh at this more being
in ISP tech support and getting anything from "show me how to get this DVD
ripper to copy the DVD I rented", to people's personal problems, help with
homework assignments, and even husband and wife getting a divorce so they
call up and keep having the ISP account password changed and even the kids
get involved changing it on the parents (my manager laughed at this one).)
Maybe even get some people to be screaming in the background from hosing
each other with cans of hair spray and lighters (had this one happen too).

6) Call tech support (had this one happen too) and tell them that a caller
ID machine which was plugged into one of your phone jacks is in pieces and
spread out over the room, a phone which was plugged into the other plug in
on your computer's modem is damaged and no longer works, and your modem
(which has the phone plugged up through it and is on the same line as the
caller ID system and is NOT plugged in through a surge protector) won't
connect and only gives the error "the modem is not responding", and all this
after having a really bad thunder storm, then after explaining all this ask
them why you can't connect to the Internet.  (Hmmm....as if that one isn't
obvious)
