Playing last night this problem seems to have gone away; I only had one
brief
interval of packet loss, even though I was doing a lot of moving around.

So I'm guessing that whatever they did fixed the problems I was having.

Note that the note in the patch notice only tells part of the story. There
was a more extended explanation up on the SOE site just before the patch;
basically saying that they had introduced a pseudo-packet-loss issue in
the last patch that hadn't shown up on Test, and that problem was to be
patched.

Personally I suspect it has something to do with the packet encryption.
With an encrypted data stream, if a lost packet contains an update for
an encryption key, packets after that would be "lost". Just speculation,
however.

ISP interference with a series of identical packets is unlikely; EQ uses
UDP, and any assumptions about a UDP packet "stream" (sic) are pretty
unwise. And frankly the equipment is typically not that smart; those sorts
of smarts use a level of processing that seriously impacts the performance
of a router.
