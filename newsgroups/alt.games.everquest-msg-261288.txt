I am currently a 'casual player' since I abandoned my mains and 
restarted on a new server around a year ago, on the new server I now 
have 1 level 50, 2 level 49s, and several level 30s.

Did that, killed Xicotl with a pali friend, and the Librarians for 
Greenmist, and ushers for lambent...and the dhampyre for his cloak...

>  Exploring Sol B and killing the Efretti.

Yup, did that too, even went on a couple Naggy raids (and a Vox one).

> Exploring Lower Guk 

Yup, did that too, got my Clr a moonstone ring, and camped the FBSS for 
way too long without success, also got my bard his drops for his Lambent 
there, and a DE mask.

> and Grieg's End.  

Went there got pwned by all reds. Will go back.

>  The people you're talking about
> haven't been to Charsis

Waiting until 50 so my gate hammer will proc to get out. (Don't always 
have a porter around)

> Caverns of Exile (Sol C), Cardok, Chardok Halls of Betrayal

SolC  and CHoB are still live? Cool... ;) I've done Chardok. The pocket 
zones are too high for me yet.

> Cazic Thule

55plus, couldn't take out the entrance mobs.

This week.

> Karnor's Castle

Been there.

> Sebilis

Working on key.

> Velketor's Labyrinth, Siren's Grotto, Kael, Crystal Caverns, Dragon Necropolis, Crypt of Nadox, Torrigan's Mines, Hate's Fury, etc, etc, etc...

Of those, I've only done Torrigan's Mines, Kael, (xp and raid), and 
Crystal Caverns (top to bottom, front to back)

I'm waiting on 50th for many of them, as my regular group doesn't have a 
porter, and even just exitting can get ugly in some zones. And a few are 
just too high (e.g. Kael I can xp in, but the 'stuff' drops off reds my 
regular group can't take efficiently enough to make it worth doing.

But you are right *I* haven't run out of content to explore (or re-
explore as the case may be.) 

However, it is fair to say that unfortunately, except for the joy of 
exploration, most of these zones offer little to any player, never mind 
casual ones.

LDoN rendered the vast majority of gear from nearly all of these zones 
obsolete. And even the casuals are tired of LDoN, and want to upgrade 
somewhere else.

Heading over to Kael or Charasis isn't going to do that! And while I am 
happy to (re)explore zones just for the sake of it, I'm in the distinct 
minority... most people want at least the potential for gear upgrades.

Not quite, they defined the 'average' player as 30-50. I think the 
definition of 'casual' can easily go right up to 65. I know that I will 
still be a casual player next week when my 50 dings 51.

We agree. Hower...

They missed the 'average player' with this expansion, if we agree the 
average player is assumed to be 30-50th. The casual 50+ plus crowd will 
get along quite nicely with OoW I think.

And for the time being the task system appears to be gimped, so the 
'average player' doesn't benefit much from that either. Even if the 
tasks were doable, with no itemization, its really just a different way 
to get some xp/pp... and by all reports, even when the tasks -can- be 
completed the xp is far less than they could grind elsewhere in the same 
time, and the pp is insignificant. So what exactly is the point?

No. 

My argument is directed at the OP who asserted:

"The thing is, I don't think they need expansions for the casual 
players, there's still plenty for them to do"

I think they do need expansions for the casual player. (And I even think 
OoW is a pretty good expansion, at least for the casual 50+ player)

I'm not really complaining about OoW at wall. 

Although I am complaining about the task system ;)
