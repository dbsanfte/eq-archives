LOL, I side by side demod Eye of the Beholder 1 on my amiga and my ibm 
clone, people were amazed. I remember i was one of the few people around 
that had the a500 hard drive, and when i asked my local computer store 
if they could check into the brand new 1 gig hard drives [back when they 
were running 1200$US] they laughed and said that a private individual 
woulld NEVER need a hdd that big.....

Still have both amigas [original 1000, and replacement 500] programs and 
all. Only reason i got a pc was because there was no non-longdistance 
internet provider, and most BBS were a toll call from our farm. This was 
right after i upgraded to a 9600 baud modem....grin
