    I'd cast it if I had a copy. :-( When I solo shrooms in Fungus Grove, I
just channel nukes onto them while they pound on me. Being able to inflict
damage while they hit me would be good, since I do get hit a fair amount.

    If it's like Mark of Karn, the hate should be pretty small. Underneath
the bridge that leads up to the Twilight Seas portal in Fungus Grove is an
area filled with Chakta Fungusbeasts. When anyone else pulls, regardless of
level, they come in pairs. When Delores runs forward with her Breastplate of
Stability and pulls with Mark of Karn, she single-pulls. Very useful.
