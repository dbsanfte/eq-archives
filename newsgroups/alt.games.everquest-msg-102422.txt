You'll want to trace back and read the original post in this thread.
That will give you your answer.  Granted, you did say "need", but
there's a lot of things in EQ that *can* be done one way, but are much
more easily done another.

*CAN* you hunt in WL without good CoV faction? Sure. But it's much less
of a PITA to be able to freely port into WL without having to have some
other poor bastard go check Woushi's status before you can port.  Or to
have to run invis through Kael if Woushi *is* up.  Not to mention that
Skyshrine is a nice zone to bail out to if suddenly get into
"complications". (Not an option with KOS CoV faction.)
