My version reference the classic "two nuns walk into a bar... you think
the first one would have warned the second one", and then utilized this
head banging incedent to leave the cat both alive and dead until the
observer could take a peek.

It was also shorter, which of course causes much rejoicing.

All in all, though, the started and not finished joke reminds me more of
Roger's reaction to the start of Shave and a Haircut.
