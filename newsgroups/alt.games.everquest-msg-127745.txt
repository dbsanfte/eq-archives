I have done very few quests so far, playing to game for about 2 1/2 months,
but I always lookup quests, items, spells, etc on those so called spoiler
sites.
I find it very usefull, its like having a personal library at your disposal.
Also like reading the comments when people have done their Epics and giving
out tips.
Dont you get help in the RL, or do you just play EQ, eat and sleep? Hehe.
