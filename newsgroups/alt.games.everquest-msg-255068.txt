Same here, only I dragged it on for a couple of months. It wound up being 
just too much, "there are the bad guys, everybody open fire!" The only 
archetype that was even somewhat interesting to me was the controller (a 
la enchanter)...that is unless there were *any* blasters in the group. 
They would surely AoE with sheer abandon.

Boring.

So, here I am once again. This is like my fifth time falling off the 
wagon. :P
