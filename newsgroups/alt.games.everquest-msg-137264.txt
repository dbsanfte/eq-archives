Do you know there is a such a policy, or are you assuming there is
based on the vague comments in the news article?  *IF* you know of
such a policy, then either provide a link to it or quote it in its
entirety.  I won't discuss a fictional policy with you.

#1  Your statement:
" open homosexuality hasn't been an issue until the last 20 years or
so"

I gave evidence proving you wrong.  You never replied to that
evidence.  Do I need to quote entire messages to you?   If you want to
claim you did, indeed, make a rebuttal, then where is this fictional
message of yours?  Do you simply want to admit being wrong?

#2- You gave a link to a news article.  You failed to rebut my
response or any of the questions following it.  A quote follows.
