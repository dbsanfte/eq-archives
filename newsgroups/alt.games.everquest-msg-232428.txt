Couldn't you just go find a green mob with a decent amount of hp, and see
which combo gives you the best output? I'm not too sure, but just glancing I
would have the warhammer. Is it 1h or 2h? Do you just want to do damage, or
are you worried about taking also?
The best thing I could suggest is to get into a grp where you are not
"important", and just experiment with your combos to find which one seems to
do the best for whatever situation you are looking at.
Sorry I couldn't be more help..........
