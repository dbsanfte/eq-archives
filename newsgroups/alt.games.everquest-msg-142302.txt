Swatches are ok for skill-ups, but he wants threads (from Spiderling
Silk) to make padding (also a no fail combine with a trivial of 16).

It's worth noting that there are usually folks selling Silks,
Pelts/Skins, and even completed Padding in the bazaar.  If I were in
Martin's position I'd probably park a mule in the bazaar with some
plat (and maybe a sewing kit and a skinning knife), and log him in
occassionally to buy up Spiderling Silks, Wolf/Cat/Bear Skins/Pelts,
and Leather Paddings.  Bet it wouldn't take long to accumulate a couple
hundred Paddings for smithing practice.
