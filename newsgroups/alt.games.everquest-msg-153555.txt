Some higher-level encounters in Luclin are impossible without
tactics which involve mod rods as they are now.  They'll either
re-tune them or the mobs simply won't die.  Those are the ones
they're talking about changing.

But it's every guild taking on a mob which currently requires
*THEM* to use mod rod tactics to win which will be affected.
FoH, for instance, doesn't need mod rods to beat Yelinak.  But
some guilds do, because they don't have the higher-end gear
yet or the advanced AAXP abilities and so on.  They're not going
to re-tune those encounters, the ones which the "average" guild
sees.  And guilds which are just moving into those stages will
suffer for it because they won't have the benefit of that extra
mana anymore.
