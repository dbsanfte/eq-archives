I'm not saying that WoW will be an EQ killer or anything. I'm saying
it does have the potential to be good. Blizzard has something else
that (most of) the others didn't have, and that's an already existing
online gaming network.

They've got more experience in running online gaming servers than most
of the other MMOG's that have come along since EQ. Stability problems
with BNet I'd attribute mostly to them not placing it as a finacial
priority since it wasn't directly making them money. With WoW, it will
be.

WoW has a lot of good ideas. If it all pans out, it'll be a great
game, plus they're shooting at being able to run it at half the
monthly fee of other MMOG's. Will it kill EQ? I can't say. Neither am
I saying I'll dump EQ to run to WoW. I'll have to try it out to see.
Blizzard's a big name. The guys directly working on WoW may not have
been behind Blizzard's other titles, but they've got the guys who were
there for at the very least consultation.

I'm taking a "wait and see" stance on WoW, but it has more promise, in
my opinion, than any of the other contenders both in the concepts that
they're working in and by virtue of the Warcraft name and world.

Of course, there's the nay-saying about Blizzard in general. But
that's just part of the modern fad of trash-talking the producers of
the games we play, IMO. Sure, they're not perfect, but neither is any
other company. I'm among the first to admit that they haven't handled,
say, the 1.10 patch for D2X as well as they should have...

As was I, actually.
