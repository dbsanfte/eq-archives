Here is the thing that boggles my mind about enchanters and the summon
companion spell...

Where are the enchanters summoning their companion FROM? The spell doesn't
work when the pet is on a hatelist, so you can't have your pet fight
something, go elsewhere, and then summon it...

Enchanter pets don't follow orders. You cannot get one to sit or guard.
They will follow you endlessly and you have no way of changing that.

Any other pet class can tell their pet to sit, go elsewhere, and summon it.
That, to me, seems to be the main purpose of the spell. Enchanters cannot
do this. Why do they have it?
