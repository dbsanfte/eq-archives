Useful Wizzy twink toys:

Solists Icy want, price, 2k-10k.  Does 38 DD every 6 seconds mana
free, right click

Runewood Great staff, 22/40  Nice toy for bopping things dead when
melee is still useful  500pp-2k

Tolapumj Robe Nice stats, but does 35% haste, works great with nice
weapons like RGS above.  8k or more

Tavellers boots, run speed enhancement, 5250 plat

Other than that you are best off just maxing int to 200 and buying
mana items.

If I only had 60 plat to twink with I'd either save every penny for
spells or spend it on Crushbone belts and pads to level up faster.
