Mostly worthless. SOW is good for a bard if cast just before you move to an
indoors location. While SOW can't be cast indoors, it will last the full
duration of the spell that was cast just before you zoned in. Selo's also
can't be used indoors, and since, like all bard songs, it's short duration,
it will have worn off inside long before SOW does.

Also, when you kite at a little be higher level, SOW is "fast enough", and
it allows you to free up a spot in your twist for potentially faster kills.
Many solo'ing bards (not this one, but many) will actually go out and buy
SOW potions to facilitate chant kiting in their 30's and 40's.

This is also semi-worthless to bard. It only helps if you're working on
tradeskills that require INT/WIS (C3 boosts both) or if you're charm/swarm
kiting using the 39 song. In the later case, you don't get any extra mana
regen, but it does increase your mana pool somewhat by increasing your INT.
