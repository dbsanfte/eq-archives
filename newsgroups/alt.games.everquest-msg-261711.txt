The did actually promise to bring out solo ldon at the last conference and
appear to have experimented with it in nedaria's landing. My Beastlord got
mega xp on the bats and rats which weren't social and there was never
anything more dangerous in the zone. Having gone from 22-24 on them, i
decided I couldn't stand it (essentially 2 mob types, no challenge).

Part of character progression that doesn't require hours of mindless farming
is getting augments, and the only realistic was a time limited player can
get that at 'low' (under 60, probably 65) levels is through ldon, and if you
log in and no-one is lfg, on my server at least, then you might wait an hour
for a ldon group to form, organise, and actually arrive at the destination.
Meanwhilst temp might be gone, the many buffs that low levels can get (eg
clarity) will have vanished, and the boredom factor means that people act
recklessly.

I speak from experience that if a ldon forms quickly, everyone seems more
disciplined and less likely to run ahead and cause a wipeout.

I was hoping that the task system would provide some sort of benefit to
people such as myself, but i tried again with my 40 cleric and again it's
"kill 10 red mobs solo", I'm happy that others have the groups forming that
can do them but if you are the only lfg and not a soloing class then
"buying" a ldon seemed to work for my cleric when he was 34, as he could
calm and fight and heal the mobs solo and the adds weren't too frequent, and
worst case, he could have rezzed himself, and usually a solo cleric doesn't
last long at the levels/gear i know.
