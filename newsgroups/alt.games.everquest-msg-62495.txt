Before you go getting silly, Tammy, I have no clue what sort of drugs
Hilgar is on, but if you to to Skyfire, you will find out what the view
looks like having your ass handed to you on a plate. I had a rough time
there at 48 with a full group. OT might be ok on the ledge, but a bit
slow at that level as many of the pulls will be starting to green out on
you. Dreadlands is the *cough* LAME *cough* default where you can just
start getting into at your level and get good xp for a long time with
everyone else in Norrath. For more interesting choices, hook up with
some friends and go do:
Entry area of City of Mist. (Bring your own group only)
Kodiaks in Great Divide (can be done with a small group, even you and
just a healer if need be.)
Deeper into Crystal Caverns (better chance of a pickup group there on
most servers I believe. Very popular dungeon.)
First few levels of Tower of Frozen Shadows (Again, get up a group of
old or new friends to check it out. Passable good loot and great xp.)

Good luck.
