    Ok just sticking to what I know here, a shadowknight with 100kpp or even
20kpp dumped on him at level one isn't going to be crippled in any way shape
or form in his 40's. Skills might be a bit behind but they'd probably catch
up in the huge capped period there but the gear..... oh my god the gear! :)

    Only other thing I can add is that we PL'd my twinked enchanter to 20
(hes for smithing if I wanted to play a chanter Id have played him and
learned him) and his skills are fairly behind but his twinked int is so
stupidly high that any spell that's fizzling, a few recasts gives a skillup.
