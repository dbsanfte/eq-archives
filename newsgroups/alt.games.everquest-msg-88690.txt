I play Everquest, Asheron's Call, Dark Ages of Camelot, Ultima Online, Realm
(occasionally) and Diablo LOD---all have things that makes me keep playing
them as well as all have things that make me sometimes wish I had never
heard of them.  I mostly play AC and EQ though as the communities on those
two are imho much more interesting. I basically play them in this order:
AC/EQ <tie for 1st place>, UO, DAoC, D2, and then Realm when I just want to
get away from it all.

    Everquest:  I have played since beta....I love it and have about 20
chars that I play regularly on Karana and Tarew Marr servers...at one time I
was even one of those dreaded creatures known as a guide....but I loved
playing more than being a guide so I quit. Of those 20 on Karana, I have a
lvl 50 WE druid who is my portal machine <its a guy char and I do not know
how to play a guy, so he buffs and tps my other chars>, lvl 45 1/2
E ranger, lvl 30 HE enchanter, lvl 26 Barb shaman, lvl 21 HE cleric, lvl 20
1/2 E druid, lvl 20 H monk, lvl 20 WE rogue, lvl 20 bard, lvl 14 DE necro
and a couple of others who are either really low level or not played....on
TM I have a lvl 29 WE Ranger and various others who are between lvl 6-14
including beastlord.  I like most everything about EQ except the lag and
losing so much experience when you die. I play EQ on a daily basis.

Asheron's Call:  I had this for a long time and didn't play it because I
thought the graphics were terrible....then I found out it was because I
wasn't using the latest graphic drivers. This game has its problems
too...and usually they are just like in EQ, patch related or lag.  The
graphics are not as nice when you look at the characters or monsters....but
the challenge is as much fun...I love the idea  that my level 42 swordswoman
can cast spells and they are only limited by my own choices.  You can make
your char much more your own here, as you choose which skills you want to
learn .....I enjoy the quest system here as well. And I really love the fact
that you do not lose experience when you die....you do get vitae and have
the potential of losing items........but since Dying has always been my best
skill in any game....I really love the fact that I don't lose all that hard
earned experience.  I play AC on a daily basis

UO:  What can I say, I have been playing it a little longer than EQ...and
although I do not have any really super chars here....I have a lot of fun
playing it.....I enjoy the skills system...hate the death system.  I am not
a pk'r so....I do like it better now that it has the two separate worlds. My
favorite char is the Admirable Bloodrose who is on the Pacific server, but I
also play on Catskills, Atlantic, and Sonoma.  I play both the 3d version
and the old version, but prefer the old due to the
movement.............although I love how my char looks in 3D :) I usually
try to play UO at least an hour a day...but don't always find the time.

DAoC:  When I got this, I thought this would replace AC and EQ....I really
liked playing at first, but then it got harder and harder to level. I now
have one char that is lvl 10.....and she keeps dying and although she does
not lose levels, she doesn't seem to be getting any closer to lvl 11.  She
is a Elf Ranger...and I really do like alot of the concepts here....but wish
it were easier to level when you have to solo.  So, now I play this only
occasionally.....maybe once a week--if that often.

Diablo LOD:  I really love Diablo, but not liking PK and thinking dueling
must be a guy thing, I usually play this when everything else is down, or
play it offline when my isp isn't responding.

Realm:  what can I say....it was my first online game, so I have a
sentimental attachment to it, even though it is too cartoony and not nearly
the challenge of the other games.........I play my lvl 522 char about once
every so often, for old times sake......usually not even once a month.

What I would say about any and all of the above or any other games.....play
and find one (or more) you like....and have fun---don't worry about anyone
else's opinions. If you enjoy playing it, then it is worth being played :)
