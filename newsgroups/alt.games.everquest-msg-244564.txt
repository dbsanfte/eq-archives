*sigh* It's this kind of commitment expectation that keeps me from wantin'
ta join a guild. Right now, my time online is mine, ta do with as I please.
There's no way I'd want ta join a guild that has tha right ta tell me how,
when, and where ta play. I was in a guild on me old server, but fortunately,
they were the laid-back, family type that had no requirements (only reason I
ever joined, actually). Me in-character bruther and me are considerin' a
couple of invitations, but will definitely need ta do some checkin' first ta
ensure that any guild we may eventually join doesn't try ta own us.

Just me take on it, anyway, fer what it's worth.
