As a soloer, the one thing that would likely make the biggest difference for
you is a fungi.

Range item: charm sucks.  Change this for a gorgana idol at the very least.
Something with HP

Tormax bracer is decent, and not too expensive on Prexus (10-15k).  For the
other bracer, Bracer of Benev, or the +15STA bracer.  I know you "rely" on
procs a lot, but the extra STA/HP will aid you far more than 15 extra dex
ever would.

NoS sucks - very expensive for the few stats that actually benefit you.
Dragon tooth choker is an ok droppable, Va'Dyn drops a 100HP neck (crappy
stats, but so what - its 100hp).  Dragons in WW drop necks too, some are
pretty decent too. They aren't raid level dragons (can be solod by a level
60), so a group at your level would have a decent chance.

Good luck buying a white dragon helm.

Weapons are fine.

Also, consider RBB+a diff cloak, as your haste option.  RBB is significantly
cheaper than CoF if plat becomes an issue.  (suggested cloak name evades me
atm...)

Take a look at the leather legs made from CT components too.
