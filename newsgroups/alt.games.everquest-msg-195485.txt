    About as many as there are untwinked casters throwing 50 pp a shot for
KEI. And there's as many copies of KEI around as there are BoA, roughly
(same drop percentages, same drop tables).

    At 32 I believe my little warrior was killing the gators in the Ancient
Croc camp in Upper Guk. Slow spawn rate, but good XP per spawn (nice XP
bonus in Upper) and if you can kill the Ancient you can make a fair amount
of cash selling the legs and arms to people twinking out those overpowered
casters. ;-)
