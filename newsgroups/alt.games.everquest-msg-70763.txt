You would be the exception rather than the rule.
Almost everyone I know buys a single copy of Win9X and proceeds to
install it on several machines.  And the irony is they don't even
realize this is in violation of the license.

Infact, WinXP's activation process is specifically designed to
discourage (I say discourage since the hardcore pirates won't be
stopped by the activation process) this sort of casual pirating.
