That's certainly a relief. And while I recognize that yours is only one guild
and my mileage may vary, it gives hope that some of the other top end guilds
have the same type of attitude once you're "on the inside".  But how about
the other type of "absence"?  I know that we have folks, even among our
higher levels and faster levelers who sometimes are playing, but take time
out for non-xp or loot activities (e.g. practicing trade skills, even if only
for the enjoyment of it, soloing around in some new zones just to see them,
going to group up with lower level older friends just to shoot the shit,
etc.)  Just curious how MoM would deal with somebody who was online at the
normal times, but not showing up for raids for a few days simply because they
wanted to go "have some fun."?  I mean, come on... admit it. If *all* you do
is raid _every single session you play_ doesn't it get old after a while?
Shouldn't you be able to go take a break from that without endangering your
guild status?

You make it sound more like interguild warfare than cooperative gaming or
friendly competition at the high end. Is it really? Man, that sounds
depressing.

LOL! You know, that's one of those problem situations that simply *never*
would have occurred to me that you might have until you said it, and then it
looked completely obvious.  I'm still looking "up" the ladder trying to
figure out how to get there. It never crossed my mind that after some of your
folks have been "there" for a while, they might get sick of it and want to go
take all their toys and start over with a new twink.  Of course, it should
have been obvious, because even in mid-level guilds like ours, we have folks
who *never* even make it to forty, though they've been playing a year longer
than me. They have five characters in the thirties, but they always get bored
with them and go twink up a new different class as well as they can and go
start over, and for months that's all they want to do. Very frustrating, as I
said, but again......... it's a game. They're paying their ten bucks a month
just like the rest of us, and if they're having fun, who am I to judge?

I guess that's one of the differences between an uberguild and a lowbie guild
that I just won't be able to understand and come to terms with until if/when
I manage to get there myself.  In the lowbie guilds I've been in, property is
property. Whoever gets it, however they come by it, is the owner.  The guild
itself is a collection of friends who are hopefully working together towards
common goals and helping each other, but your kit is your kit. Even if the
whole guild helped you get it, it's yours and what you do with it after that
is your business.
  Example. In one of our prouder moments (get ready to laugh your ass off,
all you higher level folks) one of our mid 40's members announced that he
wanted to get a particular ax that drops off a ghost in the bottom of CC who
is a triggered spawn down in the terror hall. The ghost is lvl 50 with harm
touch (or death touch, not sure) and summon, and a fairly nasty customer for
people mostly in their 40's. (I told you this would be hysterically funny for
all of you who've already killed Inny, but hey! It was a big thing for us at
the time.) Anyway, we set up a date, assembled two full groups ranging from
low 40's to 50, and went to CC. We cleared the hall and the room, the guild
brother who started it went to trigger the spawn, and we attacked and took
the ghost down. Only one person died, and then got a rez. The ghost dropped
the ax which our guild brother looted, and there was much rejoicing. It was a
pretty proud moment for us, as it was the first time we had teamed up to take
on a level 50 mob with complicating factors like that. Lots of folks
contributed their time and efforts, and got nothing out of it except the
pleasure of helping our friend get his ax.  But that's the key part. It's
*HIS* ax now. If he quit the guild tomorrow we'd certainly miss him, but I
can't imagine anybody even _thinking_ of saying, "Hey, how about giving back
that ax we got for you?"  Because in reality, he never could have solo'd that
scenario and gotten the ax, but it's still his. See what I mean?

Wow. Things really *are* different up at that altitude, eh? :-)  We still
work on the same old NB4G roll on it when we take down a mob with a nice
drop, unless it's a raid specifically for one person to get one item, as in
the example above, in which case the requestor gets it automagically.
