I am speaking especially of loot from the PoP raids until
you get access to elemental planes,much more time
efficient to farm some plat and buy stuff in the Bazaar or
do Ldons.
Doing this 2 or 3 times a week with some mixed in Luclin
bosses over a half year netted me *ZERO* updates.
I left the guild in disgust,when all the casters happily rolled
for the 41% haste item from MM.
