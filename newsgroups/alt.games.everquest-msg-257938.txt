    I dunno how I feel about that.  If I have to go to work the next
morning, there is no way I'm going to stay up an extra hour or two to
finish an encounter.  Of course, I can avoid this by not accepting any
locked encounters when I know I might have to be gone before they are
done.  But will we know how long, pretty exactly, they will last?

   People can always leave a group.  Either by going afk, or by simply
camping out.  If camping out is impossible, well, I can always reach the on
and off key on my computer.
