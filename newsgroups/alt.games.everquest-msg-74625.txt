Faster the better in both cases. If your choice is between a shaded staff
and a Centi LS then I'd use the Centi in primary and staff off hand, or at
least I would at any level below 40th. Your Dual Wield skill will rise
faster with the quicker 10/22 in your off hand and you'll do better damage
with Centi in your primary. I'd check if the shaded staff is a magic item (I
know the Blade isn't but the dagger is) and also that your Stamina is over
100, shaded weapons are heavy and the Centi Long sword is no lightweight,
either (although I'm guessing your Warrior is an Ogre so stamina is not
likely a problem)
