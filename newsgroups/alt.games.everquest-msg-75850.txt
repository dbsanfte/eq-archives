Seem like the scrolling bothers you. Check the chatfilter options. They let
you cancel a lot of text you don't want.

But for your question: The comman dyou want is called /usercolor. If you
just type /usercolor, it tells you how to specify the color. Try
/usercolor help to see what the numbers are for the various kinds
of text. If you want to know about RGB numbers, go to your favorite
WWW search engine and look for rgb.txt. Should give you some sites
with lots of color display and the according RGB triple.
