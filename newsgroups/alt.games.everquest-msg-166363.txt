Sorry to hear that, Rumbledor.

I kinda don't think, however, that you need to worry about guilds at this
point.  Monual didn't join a guild until his late 30's, and even then he
could have gotten by just fine until his 50's.

There is, of course, the social aspect.  You may wanna try
serverwide.age:age for all your social needs.  =)  They have a fun time
talking there, even if the conversation sometimes drifts a bit far from EQ
issues.  ^_^
