Precisely a mixed bag. :)

The increase plat supply (due to ldon in particular) drives prices up.
The increase in items (due to mudflation in general) drives prices down.

This results in old items being driven down as mudflation renders them 
obsolete 'at any price' so-to-speak.

But the new items are more expensive than ever before... due to 
inflation and immunity from mudflation (at least until the next expansion)
