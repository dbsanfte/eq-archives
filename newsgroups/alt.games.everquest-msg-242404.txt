   On FV, where you play, that is.  On FV just about everything but epic and
epic drops, and some high end keys and grandmaster trophies are droppable.

   Which means if you want and end up with 500 or so plat burning a hole in your
pocket, you can rent of of the droppable grandmaster trophies in bazaar and do
the guess to the 100% weight reduction 10 slot bags, considerably nicer than
LDoN bag you lost.  Oddly, the resulting permanent bag you get from doing this
is also no-drop.

   Mine too.  In fact, I usually do my 1-4 or 5 leveling in Qeynos newbie yard,
and typically get about around 15 plat or more.  Toss in a few more from hunting
in BB and I'm well on my way riches!

  Spell like effects of your character foaming at the mouth?  *That* would be
cool!

   So, how good is this snare that Berserkers get?  Good enough to consider
'zerkers a snaring class?  Or do their snares only work for like creatures 30 or
under or something.  If they can snare their whole lives, this alone is a
significant upgrade over warriors.

  Bonechips in the bazaar.  Another good plat bringer.
