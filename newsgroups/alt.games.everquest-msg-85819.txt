That proves nothing.  It's simply evidence, easily discarded by those who
want to.  Are you saying that the game is perfect and there are no old bugs
or issues that have yet to be addressed?  Without Verant addressing it
either way isn't it POSSIBLE that it's simply a back-burner issue with them
that they'll get around to eventually?   If it's POSSIBLE, then that proves
your last sentence is incorrect.
