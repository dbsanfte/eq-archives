I mostly complain about 90% of wizards being stupid fucks that can't keep
agro on their pulls.

Exp rate... I don't care anymore.  ya ya, 6.57 aa more til I get MGB and
Elder title, whoopde fuckin doo.  I get more fun out of exploring a new zone
(just got flagged for PoV/PoS, which helped a lot) and trying new things
than exping in the EXACT SAME PLACE for 83 gazillion hours.

I'm probably just depressed about being guildless atm though.
