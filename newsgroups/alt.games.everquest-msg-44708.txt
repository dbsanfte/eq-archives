but i am on afternoon shift, when everyone i used to group with is
playing, and when i am free to play, there is no one around to group
with =(  I have tried getting groups, just not much luck and wind up
soloing while lfg or moving to a zone where i just solo if I don't have
much time.  I actually prefer to group with my druid.  Esp since the
group i was usually with consisted of a 29 enchanter, 29 cleric, 27
warrior and myself a 30 druid.  I usually pulled stuff cause of track
and snare, and then "trained" it on the warrior.  With Clarity I rarely
was dropping out of mana, and shared heal duties with cleric depending
on who had more mana at the time, as well as the usual snare/dot/nuke
and buffs as needed.

Primetime it's easy for a druid to find a group as everyone is still
looking for any old healer usually at that level.  But Daytime EST not
many people play that i have found yet.
