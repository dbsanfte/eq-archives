Thanks, I think I might have found a fix for it though. I play in 640X480. 
When my desktop is in 640X480 and launch the game,  I get the stuck 
pointer.

However, if I set my desktop to 800X600 [ or higher ] then launch the game,
poof ! no stuck pointer. 

However I have no clue why this works [ so far :-) ].
