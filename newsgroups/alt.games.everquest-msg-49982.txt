What is the appropriate amount of donations for things like ports?  I'm
assuming that a lot of this is level dependent, and I have a 23 level
Ranger, but he's my prime character, non-twink and perenially short on plat.
I'm tired of people saying, "Donate what you feel is appropriate," because I
have no clue.  I have a lower level shaman who freely sows and buffs all the
time when asked.

Thanks
