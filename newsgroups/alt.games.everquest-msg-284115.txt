I disagree with you. They were put there to be used when needed. If a cleric 
is not there to heal, then yes... let someone else do it. That is why the 
spell was given to them. And if a caster needs mana... twitch a little... go 
ahead! It won't hurt ya!

No one is "obliged" to do anything. But a good group member does what helps 
the group. "Solo thoughts" have no use in a group, imo.

(btw, True North is now useless due to game changes, such as the compass. 
They really should get rid of it now. Just the mere existence of a spell 
does not mean it is still useful. However, the ones that are there for a 
reason and the reason is still valid, should be used when the situation 
merits.)
