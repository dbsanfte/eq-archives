As the others have said, you can't rely on what the retailers say, they have 
plenty of incentive to lie and many are just uninformed.

On the other hand ...

Retail promotions are a big deal and stores spend lots of marketing dollars 
on ad campaigns that absolutely require commitments to dates certain. EB 
Games and CompUSA ran special promotions for the CoH launch that required 
media placed ads with hard time commitments. When that kind of thing 
happens, the distribution channel demands (and often gets) a hard date 
commitment from a publisher. This is often the reason there is date pressure 
for a publisher to release on a particular date. They've made a hard 
commitment to the channel and they can't afford to miss that commitment 
based on purchase commitments and other contractual obligations like Market 
Development Funds, etc. When a date is given to a retailer, you can bet that 
some employees will start to leak the private internal sales memos and 
report on the date as a fact. This is exactly what happened with SOE's 
release of SWG, when retailers started reporting June 21 as the release date 
and all the dialog on the forums consisted of arguments between those who 
said they had hard assurances of the June 21 date, and those who said "If it 
ain't official, it ain't real and btw retailers know shit".

Given the number of references I've heard to Nov 15 and the past history of 
SOE and its releases, I'm betting on Nov 15, but I won't be surprised if it 
turns out to be a different date.
