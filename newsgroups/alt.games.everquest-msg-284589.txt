That should be easily doable. Just assign R and T to for example
hotbar2 key1 and hotbar2 key2. Then place the hotbuttons on the right
slots to the keys you assigned. There should be no need to have the 2nd
hotbar even visible, just make sure its on the correct page before you
close it. Hitting the keyboard keys (R,T etc) for it should work even
if the hotbar window itself is closed.
