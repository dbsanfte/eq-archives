Best info I have (not looking at AA) is that at the end of 55 you are
52.2% through the exp required to fill level 60 (note not start)

If you look at actual amount of work needed (due to the fact that higher
level mobs give more xp than lower level mobs) then the half way point
is nearer level 47

However this does not factor expected longer down time at higher levels
(more mana to med etc.) or that you will be killing very low blues
rather than very dark blues at the top levels (for optimal xp)

I would suggest that the half way point is about level 50-52

Of course then you can do AA stuf for what another 200+ levels ?

Ho hum, I may ding 36 tonight :-(
(8% / 35% of the way to 60 depending how you count it)

Jim
