If you want to miss Lake of Ill Manners, where *everybody* goes to grind
out xp in a zone full of a-holes (be sure to filter out all the chat
channels you can if you go) you could go to N. Karanas. Do druids kite
very well at 20? If so, Rathe mtns. might be another option, if you can
handle giant skellies and cyclops, and the giant hunters would likely
thank you profusely for cleaning them out.
