Same here. Was in a group that looked normal, 1 warrior, 1 cleric, 1 druid, 1
rogue, 1 shaman, 1 wizard.
But the puller was insane, usually had around 2 yellow sarnaks on us (at the
FD in IllOmen). Worked with no problems, until group decided to do a10 min
break, and the puller KEPT pulling the average 2 yellow mobs. So me (druid),
the warrior, and the rogue had to beat up the incoming pulls, and every time
they died, the warrior just pulled a few more, disregarding the fact that we
was only half a group.
Still dont get how we survived it. Was so bad that i as a level 28 druid had
to meelee, and then throw in a nuke whenever i had mana for one.
