Fungus Covered Tarmok Staff 2HB 30/45 disdam 7	wt 2.2

I just picked up this bad boy for my 34 monk.... 
now I understand damage bonus, by level, but what exactly happens with
disease damage....   Is is resistable? Is there a saving throw?  if
not are there certain creatures that just inately resist?

as usual and always, I apprecate your input and time.
