Halfling is a good choice, but so are the others.  Halflings get sneak and
hide at level 1, which is "cool" but not actually very USEFUL unless you're
just using him for corpse recoveries in The Hole (deity there must be
Brell).

Go with the race you like the most. You can't screw up too badly unless you
pick a race it turns out you just can't get into.  I created a wood elf,
deleted it, went with gnome, deleted it, then finally settled on dwarf
simply because I remembered that for 2 years I've wanted to create one of
that race.  No particular reason, it just fits me the best (and she's very
cute with her blonde beard, too).
