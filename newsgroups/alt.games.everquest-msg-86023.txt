  The reason damage absorption spells are useful are to buy the person getting
hit a little time.  The intelligence casters in particular have very little HP
and sometimes the healer might not even realize the caster is getting beat on
until they're on death's door.  The damage absorption allows them to take a few
more hits, thus giving the tank(s) more time to taunt the mob off them, and
giving the healer(s) more time to heal.

  It's not really efficient or ideal protection for tanks who are always getting
beat on, but for a caster who generally doesn't draw too much aggro, but could
use some emergency protection in case they do, I imagine it's quite valuable.

  Also, as you mention, it can cast on a character in emergency situations,
when, for whatever reason, the healer isn't healing.

  There may be some other applications for the spell that I'm not quite sure of
(wizards/enchanters casting it on tanks when fighting uber magic-immune bosses
that they can't really help against any other way?) but those, I imagine, are
the main ones.
