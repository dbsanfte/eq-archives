The early shawls can certainly be done solo. However the "high end" 
versions of them, like the last shawl, are just as impossible to solo as 
anything else worthwhile. It's a great quest. My wife has the last 
shawl, as do a number of people in our guild. But you need a fairly high 
end and skilled raid force to get that last shawl. The battle is not a 
cake walk. (Though it is a LONG walk.)
