Ok, it boils down to this.  You expect ME to cover for your laziness, I
expect YOU to cover for your laziness.

Having regulared this newsgroup for far longer than you, I'd say that Bizbee
is, if nothing else, a master of sarcasm (as well as being extremely skilled
at lambasting such idiots as yourself)

It was NOT the leader telling me to bind and port people out, it was some
miscellaneous member (a monk I believe) that started it, and nearly everyone
else tried to bludgeon me into compliance

I had to read that back in high school once, I barely remember much of it
except one part with a prostitute that he just talked to and that he ran
away from a boarding school or something.

There was no conflict, no one harassed me in tells or anything, the raid
leader himself pointed out that I did indeed have the right to not change my
bind spot.

See, so you wouldn't have been one of the many idiot melees, you have taken
responsibility for yourself and prepared a contingency plan.

Where the hell did guilds come up?  Both myself and (as far as I could tell)
Lokari's raids were public.

Nice, sarcasm.

Everyone enjoys an occasional ad hominem attack.

Owned your marker?  What in the hell does that mean?

As for claiming that you won, as long as the argument continues (or until
Bizbee and myself post concessions), no one has 'won'.  Claiming that you
won this argument is like Hitler making a public announcement during the
Super Bowl as a zombie that he won WWII because he killed some jews (yeah,
extreme analogy here, but it's all I can think of at the moment that has any
connotative impact)
