To make this a question with any relevance whatsoever, you have to change
"don't have much of a clue of" to "have no interest whatsoever".

>Its ok, I understand I am a bit on the unusual side

No, you attribute yourself with some uniqueness, yet you are all too
familiar, in a grey and unremarkable way. A stock item.

You know my agenda?   Curses.. foiled again.

I never said that you were, what I said is that you are just one of those
many colourless, nameless faces in the crowd that chant "fight...fight..
fight" at the end of school

You are right, not nearly as good.

I hate to disappoint you, but my flamewar days with biz are long gone.
