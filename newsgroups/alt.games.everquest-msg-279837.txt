Well, yes and no. I really don't expect everyone to practice ever 
tradeskill in order to be able to obtain a tradeskilled item. What I 
*might* expect would be for the guild to support its tradesfolk 
internally, and for those tradesfolk to get their components through 
their own efforts or those of their guildmates exclusively. Certainly, 
this should only occur "within reason" and likely exercising the honor 
system. Maybe we could impose a guideline that discourages the use of 
any crafted items that trivial at more than 5x the player's level or 
something. That just might work...

Very good idea. Something that normally occurs in any guild.

I think that would just be chalked up to, if they could have obtained it 
themselves, then they can have it. No lambent stones for a level 10 
bard, though. ;)

Precisely.

That's approaching the perfect world scenario, and I don't know how 
close we'll come to that, but I agree.

Hope you don't mind me quoting you in the kick-off meeting. :P
