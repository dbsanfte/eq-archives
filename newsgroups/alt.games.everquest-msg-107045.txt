Hey all,
Yes, I know, I am newbie. And I could probably find the information I am
looking for somewhere, but most people would think this info too obvious to
leave out in the open.
First one, everywhere I read about people "winning a role" or "losing a
role". Then today I read a log that mentioned it. How does one go about
doing this? And why isn't this done at lower levels.
Second, the Druid I made way back when I started a few months ago dinged 20.
(Yes pathetic, but I have made like 4 chars since then, only to return back
to him). How do I go about getting him a last name? I thought I read
somewhere that you could get a last name at 20, although I could be insane.
Thanks for any help,
Chaos
