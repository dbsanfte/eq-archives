Greetings EQrs.  I'm currently looking to replace some of my armor pieces
with better AC, but I can't seem to make a choice. So I am asking you guys,
and fellow warriors, if they have and suggestions or ideas (or quests) for
back, shoulder, bracers, and arms.  I thought about going for some cobalt
bracers, but heard they are 'rare' drops and the breastplate is 'ultra
rare'. Currently right now I am looking for items with above 10ac.

Thanks,
