  I've actually seen a fair number of evils and goods.  I'd say it's
probably split about this way: 1/5 evil, 1/5 good, 3/5 neutral.

  Some characters have no choice about what alignment they can choose.
If you want to play a shadow knight or necromancer, you have to be
evil.  If you want to be an Iksar or dark elf (and I believe troll or
ogre), you have to be evil.  If you want to play a paladin, you have
to be good.  I also think clerics have to make the decision between
good and evil... if they worship evil leaning gods, they become evil,
if they worship neutral/good leaning gods, they have to become good
(not entirely sure on that one though... clerics worshipping neutral
gods might get to be neutral).

  I personally wouldn't have implemented this style of alignment
system myself, but it does create a unique ruleset and possible deters
some of the more gameplay oriented and less roleplay oriented folks
(though I'm sure so good RPers are deterred as well), and enough
people actually want to roleplay a specific type of character that we
are willing to make the gameplay sacrifices necessary to play a good
or evil aligned character.
