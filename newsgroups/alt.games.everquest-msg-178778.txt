What do you think the best way to level an enchanter with druid backup
would be? As a lark I reactivated my druid and will see if I go faster
if it's backing my enchanter up. Doing this on one computer, so no
fancy moves will be possible.

The enchanter is already upper midlevel so we're long past buffs,
damage shields, and heals. This will be the enchanter soloing
normally, except now the druid can help. But I can only control one at
a time.

I'm thinking regular charm kiting, with the druid doing the pulling
and snaring, and also damage shielding the pet. As long as the charms
hold while I am pulling seconds and thirds and fourths and fifths, I
should be okay, yes? Because I won't be able to see if the charm
breaks from the druid screen. That makes me think snaring the pet
(before it becomes a pet) might be a good idea too.

However there are alternative ideas. One is I could leave the druid
and enchanter grouped and let the druid do the killing. Skills aren't
really a concern, I get them when I'm not doing this anyways. I would
want to kill L35-40 mobs doing this, yes? Green to the druid but still
blue to the enchanter and probably go down in little more than one
blast of wildfire (no laughs, the last time I played the druid
seriously predates Luclin and moonfire etc). This option has the bonus
of not having to control the enchanter at all, all the work is done on
the druid side.

Finally it might be too hard to control both on one computer, and I'll
end up just playing  the enchanter as if it had no backup, switching
over to the druid just to refresh potg, regrowth, and soe.

Any other options? Any suggestions? What do you think?
