So far as I know you are right in that you only get sitting mana regen 
rate when not moving, but you are missing one of the biggest advantages 
of using the pony.  Its not to be able to med while running around, its 
to be able to med during a fight without getting "sit agro".  As a 
cleric the ability to med right next to an angry monster is quite 
valuable.  Well it used to be back when clerics were healers.  Haven't 
had much call for a pony since I became a melee artist.
