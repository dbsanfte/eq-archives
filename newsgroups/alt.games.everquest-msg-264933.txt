One type of internet connection that is getting more and more popular is 
wireless.  You could at least dig around and see if there is something 
like that available reasonably.  I have had mine for 3 or 4 years now, 
and it's been awesome.  I get 1M down, 256k up.  Outages have been rare, 
and they have been very responsive to tech support calls.  The one I have 
is a local northern Colorado only company though.
