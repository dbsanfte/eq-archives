Your ranger is still in banded?

At 49, magicians are powerful.  At 54, they aren't.  Enjoy the window. 
Soloing 55+ with a magician is difficult, dangerous, or inefficient, or a
combination of all three.  Rangers are still going strong at 55+.

Using this criteria, your ranger should already be outperforming your
magician.  Ranger isn't a power-soloer, they have to think about their
targets.  When they do, there is much less downtime than magician.

Why are you sitting there?  A ranger would be fearing the next mob and
earning more experience.  :)
