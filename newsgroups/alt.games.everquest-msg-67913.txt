Look at the proprietory crap carefully.
You'll see SCSI controllers based off the AIC-7xxx chipset.  You'll
see bridge chips based off either Intel or VIA chipsets.

These are the same components that go into non-name brand PCs.  The
only difference is that the "proprietory crap" are the glue that holds
the components together so you can't easily replace them should they
fail.

Most vendors won't bother with anything past glue logic as far as
proprietory stuff simply because it's too expensive for them to make
their own stuff for every machine.  Only at the really high end do you
run in to the Made by IBM tag.  By high end I mean AS/400 and above.

Here's something to consider:  There's only about 5 motherboard logic
chip makers available these days for PCs.  Out of the 5, only two are
real big players and used by practically all major PC vendors.

What utter hogwash.
RIMM is RIMM is RIMM.
Trace those RIMM chips back, you'll see it came from just a handful of
chip makers:  Micron, Samsung, etc...

The only thing you end up paying for when you buy IBM approved RIMM is
the overhead IBM passes on to you for packaging/shipping/warehousing
those RIMMs.

I can garantee you, buying RIMMs from non-IBM vendors and putting them
into IBM PCs will not make one damn bit of difference other than
you'll have more money with the non-IBM RIMMs.

You mean like Gartner group?  Or IDG?
According to them, IBM is middling in performance and reliability.

It's only in the support area that large companies have a leg up over
the smaller ones.
