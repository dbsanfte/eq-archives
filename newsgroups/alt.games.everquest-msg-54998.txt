I dunno about that. I took my level 31 chanter to Rathe and soloed with
her there yesterday afternoon. The specs, gargoyles, and mares were all
blue to me and quite doable even alone. Just stay out of the way of the
bloodbone drakes and any named mobs. I only died one time and got 3 nice
drops in a few hours: a belt (better than the BCC she was wearing), a robe
(better int and ac by a bit than my Blackened Crystaline Robe, but no chr
and really ugly graphic =P ), and a bracer (chr and a couple of other
stats.) T'was well worth it for me. /smile
