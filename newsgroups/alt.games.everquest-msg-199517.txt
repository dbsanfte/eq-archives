    Then why did your players "need" to get PoV/PoS flagged through the
trials? Or, rather, the trial, since everyone flocked to the one? I say
"need" because clearly it was more than a want if they'd break up your guild
and leave valued friends behind in order to do this.

    If they want to make effective raiders, then yes, they should. Item
progression is behind every sane decision of where to raid and how long to
raid there. You weren't in HoT because you liked the decor, you were there
because Skyshrine armour was the next logical step up from whatever you were
wearing previous (PoFear/Thurg/Kunark mix, I'd assume). If you choose to
skip part of the progression, like say passing Sleeper's Tomb and the DPS
boost from Prismatics/Primal in order to do Luclin minors, you have to
accept that you're going to have a rougher time of it. Mudflation can make
some camps pointless, but the raid path from Velious onwards is still pretty
difficult to deviate from successfully.

    How does a designer balance encounters otherwise? The high AC raid mobs
of Luclin have high AC assuming that players will have the ATK-enhancing
weapons from Sleeper's. The high-density clearing required in Vex Thal and
PoP assumes your support casters have the mana acceleration from Luclin. And
so on. You can cheat past some of these encounters, but eventually you will
need to gear up off something that provides the abilities that you skipped
earlier.
