Hi There

I've had identical problems all weekend everything works fine for 1 to 2 
hours then up creeps the packet loss rate. Ping times remain constant 
then 'You've been disconnected'

All attempts to re-log after that get "Error 1001" I can log to chat. 
The patcher works fine. But I cannot get to a server to play. First time 
it happened I even re-booted my machine. gave up after 20 mins. Came 
back after an hour. Logged no problem. 2 hours later over it went again. 
Checked the Sony site no connection problems page whistled down at 
5.8kBytes per second.

got "error 1001" for the next hour approx. 12 attempts to re log. The 
next one was a real pain. I got killed as I dropped during a fight.

After that I've been doing tradeskills. But so far I've dropped 6 times 
in approx. 4 hours of play over 2 days.
