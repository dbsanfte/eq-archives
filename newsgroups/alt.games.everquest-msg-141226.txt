Thanks for the info.  I never quite understood why people were willing to
pay so much for simple items.  Now I know.  But I tell you, buying from NPC
is a hit or miss proposition too.  I have been needing lots of snake skin
lately to cook up some Bug Juice.  Hunting snakes down for 20 skins is a lot
of work even though I can kill it with one blow.  So I ended up looking for
it at NPC.  They have them, but not in quantity!  At most 4 skins!  Buying
from NPC is not an answer.

Emilio.
