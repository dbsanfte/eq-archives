No, and some people will (obviously, IMO) have a collection of accounts
needed for tradeskills.   But the "catch" is the way they've developed their
system, at least as I read it.  My understanding (admittedly limited) is that
you lose the ability to create lesser items as you advance (which I find
incredibly stupid in theory.)

So, if you're creating the Uber Rifle of Dooooom, you'll need some number
(greater than one) of schematic components.  Each of those components
may (and probably will at the higher skill levels) require some number of
schematics themselves.  And each of those lesser schematics may require
some number themselves.

Since you lose the ability to make lesser items as you progress, you might
be able to have a few accounts which can make all the high level
requirements.  But you can't make the mid-level ones or the lower-level
ones.  And the person who makes the mid-level ones can't make the
low-level ones.   So, at least in theory, you might need (/em grabs a
number out of the air) eight accounts just to make that item.  Or more.

Manufacturing will largely be guild-based, IMO, with the advantage
going to guilds with mule accounts, pretty much the same as in EQ.
