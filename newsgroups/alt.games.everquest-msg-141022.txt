I haven't tried with a semicolon, but the new UI does indeed allow naming 
exploitation. When entering a name the first letter is automatically 
capitalized and no letters thereafter can be capitalized.

With the new UI, however, you can enter for example "Donalds", then use the 
arrow keys to get back to the beginning of the name, and enter "mc". It won't 
let you then capitalize that first letter, but when you see them in game it 
would show as "McDonalds" because the first letter in-game is capitalized. 
Server chats and serverwide chat channels, however, would see your name as 
"mcDonalds" because the first letter isn't automatically capitalized.

I saw someone recently who had no capital letter at all. Just enter the name, 
go back to the begging and enter the first letter again, then delete out the 
first letter that had been capitalized.

Another annoyance involved here is seemingly duplicate names. Every name I can 
think of from a series of books I absolutely love (The Belgariad series by 
David Eddings) is taken, anything I can think of from them. That being said, 
the name "Zakath" was taken, as well as his full name "Kalzakath". Though I 
have deleted the character since, I did manage to create a second "Kalzakath" 
by entering "izakath" (and the "i" became capitalized), going to the beginning, 
then entering the "Kal". In-game it appears as "KaIzakath" (that's an i), which 
looks just the same as the original "Kalzakath".
