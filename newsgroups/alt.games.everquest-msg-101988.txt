What the hell does the ability to spell "please" and "thanks" have to do
with what your first language is?  Where is it taught that "plz" and "thx"
are words in the English language?  I was not particularly speaking of
non-native English speakers, which should have been quite obvious from my
posts, but even then, I can hardly see how they can be excused.  For
example, I know some French, probably not enough to communicate well with a
native French speaker, but I sure as hell know how to spell simple French
words, and I'm not going to start spelling them wrong just because I see a
native French speaker spelling them wrong with slang online.  Why is it that
any time someone from the US posts something that someone from somewhere
else disagrees with, the poster is accused of being "arrogant?"  And you
have the insolence to accuse me of generalizing?  Is it not arrogant to
specifically point out your opinion that the US spelling of "generali(s/z)e"
is not "correct?"  How can other cultures be "more used to the slang
emanating from the US" than people from the US?  Sigh...
