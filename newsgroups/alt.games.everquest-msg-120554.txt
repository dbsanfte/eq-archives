I know a level 60 who just had their name changed.  So what
level is "high enough to where they won't change it?"

And the rule about phrases is which one again?   The *only* instance
of the word "phrase" in the Naming Policy is here:  "Common words
and phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of

references.   So, which rule did the phrase violate?
