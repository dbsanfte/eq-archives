That is about the only one that has to do with roleplaying at all.

Nothing at all to do with roleplaying.
Why should those places have banks?

Nothing to do with roleplaying and its also something which is in muds
that verant said they will never do:

Charge "rent" for items in the bank or on you. Basically what you
suggest would be akin to charging rent for items. Muds do that because
they are free, EQ is not.


>4) Quadruple the weight of all money and food and water. 

So you can roleplay that food and water are heavier? Why?

So to you roleplaying is NOT having to be somewhat dependant on other
players in the world, funny to many it would be the opposite.

Remember, Npcs can't see you roleplay or not.

Thats kind of moot though, the constant spamming and not regenning
mana or health as well makes people get food anyway.

Why? Now evidently having to look longer for food is roleplaying?

That makes more sense than all of the other suggestions also. If you
can't speak to a troll player, you should not be able to speak to a
troll vendor. 

Problem is that all the npcs speak common, so they'd have to reprogram
them all zone by zone, just for that server, don't see that happening.

All that is taken care of by faction now, even the last one. A
negative to a faction is FAR more harmful than a plus is helpful.

They just about all do have factions.


>16) All NPC's will give Exp if they would normally. 

??? You mean vendors too? Vendors don't because people would kill them
then. That basically would come under griefing, Someone kills a vendor
its not there to service you, it is irritating and play stopping. So
vendors are not xp to make it pointless.

Threatening is Kos now. 
Many factions start as scowl and its basically a part of the game to
improve them and actually could ENCOURAGE roleplaying. Once again this
is almost anti roleplaying.

This is similar to what they have planned.
Once again though, I don't call forcing you to only play with certain
persons as "roleplaying" and once again its kind of the opposite.

Done.

>22)No TCC code anywhere.

Odd they think the opposite, tcc everywhere. To the point that Absor
thinks lower level characters will be hired to do things for upper
level characters, which I have a few problems with:

1) How does that really cause roleplaying?

2) Isn't that suggesting that you circumvent the tcc so then what is
the point of the tcc?

3) When, just as an example, it takes me like 21 hours to finally get
the aqua goblin I need for my druid epic are people of a level to make
the thing drop going to be hanging around there for 21 hours? I doubt
it, no matter how much I pay them.

Verant said that

? all npcs are. Very few are "miss cons" but they are supposed to be
to discourage killing them a lot.

Well thats a basic redesign of all loot in eq, which I would have
liked in the first place but nothing to do with roleplaying per se. In
fact many of these rules would attract thousands of non roleplayers as
well.

Similar to what pvp is like now except for the insurance part which is
more like AO in general.

It already is on the roleplaying server.

Similar to what they are doing on roleplaying server.

Odd, they are doing the opposite and making ANYONE only bindable in
cities. Just goes to show you that people have a different idea of
roleplaying. Of course, like nearly everything else neither way has a
thing to do with roleplaying.


>32) emote will be language specific 

They are doing that, except for the action ones like smile.. guess
why? Yep exactly, you don't smile in a language, go ahead and try.
You also don't tap you foot, blush, raise your hand, etc in a
language. I guess the text emotes could be turned off altogether so
you just see the person tap their feet instead.


>33) The /friend name command will require acceptance via a prompt from

Why? and again that seems almost antiroleplay, how do you roleplay a
friends list or accepting being on one?


>34) The /who command will only display characters who are on your
>friends list or who are neutral or better in base faction to you.

Why? Again how would you roleplay that.. them being in your pager
system? How would have have a pager in such a world? 
Again, rather antiroleplay.

Why? It already seems pretty big.


>37) All ocean zone lines crossable while not on the boat. 

That would mean totally redoing zones in such zones. The boat does not
zone like a player does, it basically hits a point where it is told to
zone those players into butcher and have them be on the boat.. there
is no zone line that the boat hits that zones it I don't think so its
not as simple as saying "okay people zone now too" but more like
totally redoing such zones to have zone lines.


>and just for fun, 38) Sink Vellious into the ocean or fix the magic
>resist/ magic immune mobs so casters can have fun too. 

My idea of a roleplaying server is one where the people playing on it
roleplay. No rule that anyone ever makes can cause that to happen, at
all. The only thing that could be done would be verant having full
time spies on the server watching your every move to boot you off.
Most people would not really like that and verant could not afford
that, nor could they place that in the hands of customers.

Firiona vie will be a server with a different ruleset, which I and
many people will try for the ruleset. Its something new. However the
rules have nothing to do with roleplaying nor will you see anymore of
it on that server than any other. Nor would you see more of it on a
server with the rules here. I won't be roleplaying any more on Firiona
vie than I do on the servers I play on now, which is basically when I
feel like it if at all. 

A lot of people don't really seem to know what the word "roleplaying"
means. When you get right down to it its playing a role. If you want
to see roleplaying go to your doctor's office and talk to the
receptionist. If you want to hear roleplaying listen to a rap song by
someone who is probably nothing like the things they are saying in the
song. If you want to see it in everquest, do it. Roleplaying is what
you do, like in real life where that receptionist keeps playing that
role no matter how I act, so should you in the game and not be
affected by others. 

Needing rules in game to do it is anti roleplay and missing the point.
