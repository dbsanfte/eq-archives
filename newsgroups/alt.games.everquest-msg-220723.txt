I mentioned the ID bracer in case someone might think that the
added damage would be accounted for by one, although the fact
that my damage output changed when I put the summoned one on was
pretty clear to me.

The in game text on the spell specifically says up to level 24. 
It makes a lot more sense this way, mind you, but thats what it
said, so I was pretty surprised.  I'm also pretty annoyed, since
I've long since stopped bothering summoning the thing when I'm
not using 24- nukes.  Thats a lot of potential damage gone to
waste cause I believed the text.

Do all mage summoned items work the same way; function up to the
next summon, regardless of what the text might say?  And do they
work on everyone else's spells as written, or the same way as for
mages?

I noticed the lack of a new damage producer spell at 39, not a
very exciting level all in all.

Splendid One, 39 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
