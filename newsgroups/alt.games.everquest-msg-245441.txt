Customer support? What fucking customer support?? You are only allowed 
one customer service ticket, and they purge them every week, whether 
they've been answered or not. I had to deal with some ass wookie named 
Genitalia who followed me around the galaxy because I was a dancer for 2 
weeks and they didn't even change his name, let alone do anything about 
his disgusting actions. No, the complete lack of customer service is 
what drove me away from the game.

Of course this could have changed since I left. But I certainly didn't 
stay in that game long.
