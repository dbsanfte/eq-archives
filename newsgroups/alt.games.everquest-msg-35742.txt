I just started a PvP char and am now beginning to understand
what you mean about the 'excitement' of PvP. But at the same
time I think a very large population of EQ's really don't want
this type of hostile environment. Just look at how many PvP vs
carebear servers we have. Most peeps just want to have fun,
and the carebear servers allow this without the risk of someone
withing your level 'range' coming up and bashing you in the head.
