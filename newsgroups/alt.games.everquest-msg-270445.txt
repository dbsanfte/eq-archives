I'm not going out of my way to do anything. I don't need to go out of
my way to counter completely assinine statements.

Incidentally, I like WoW better, too. The only reason I play EQ2 is my
girlfriend has an account and an All Access Pass, so she's let me
hijack 2 of her character slots when she's not playing. I'll be buying
WoW myself when we have the money. I just don't suffer the idiotic
delusion most people do that liking one game means having to hate and
bash the other for every little mistake. It's not like Blizzard's
track record is flawless...
