Well, maybe *I* misunderstand what the term 'supported' means. What I've
always understood it to mean is this: The piece of software/hardware you
are using may work with our piece of software/hardware, but we can't
help you if it suddenly stops working. We don't have the specs, we don't
have the manuals, we don't have the right to start messing around with
the internal problems that your piece of software/hardware is having.

Am I wrong on that?
