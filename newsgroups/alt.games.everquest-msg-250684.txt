Get the Diamond Prism of Companionship from LDoN. It helps all your
pets up to level 65.  With it, you will summon a pet that has a full
set of armor and will funtion much better. Also saves you having to
summon the armor for the pet if you were doing so.

The Ward of Xegony (post-60 air pet) is the first major upgrade to
your pets you will have available. It's ability to tank and to stun
casters makes it useful all the way to 65. The 62 water pet is good
DPS if you are in a group where it can backstab.  The 62 pet is also
good when farming greens.  Since runners can be backstabbed by it,
they don't go far. but it isn't as good at tanking exp mobs as the
Ward..

Get at least one of the pet weapon spells.  The summoned weapons each
add 100 HP to the pet, as well as letting them have a processing
weapon.  Blade of Walnan works against the mob's magic resist; Fist of
Ixblat works against the mob's fire resist; Blade of Kedge works
against the mob's cold resist. The fist is not very useful if you like
fighting in Skyfire; the Kedge blade isn't very good if you like
fighting Frost/Ice mobs. You may want more than one pet weapon.

There are 2 pet belts. The level 64 girdle has 500 HP; the 61 belt has
250 HP. Both have AC and both have DEX to help the pet process the
weapons.  You should have the 56 pet mask for pet haste, but still try
to get Burnout V at 62 for the 85% haste.  

Get the best pet heal you can or be prepared to chain pets. Many
clerics ignore healing pets and once the pet is gone the cleric has to
heal YOU. If you solo, you can either heal pets or chain them. I
prefer to heal since chaining sends in a unequiped and unhasted pet.
The level 60 pet heal is researchable.   

The LDoN spell to summon an orb of exploration is very useful. You'll
use the air pet a lot and it has the annoying habit of going invis
just as you about to hand it summoned weapons.  The infravision and
See Invisible of the orb is great for eliminating this annoyance and
also a great boon to your night-blind friends.

The summon saphire braclet and summon brilliant bauble are good to
have unless you have better focus gear. The bracelet adds to your DD
spell damage; the earring cuts mana cost of nukes by 15%. Mana
preservation items cut the cost of all spells by 10% but we cannot
summon one. 

The new summoned choker gives you a chance to save using a component
when casting. Since Reagent Conservation IV won't work on imbues, the
only reason we would use RC IV is to save malachite when pet summoning
-- not that useful since malachite is cheap.  You only need Reagent
Conservation III for CotH or Banishment, so I augmented a Royal Amulet
of Takish-Hiz that dropped in an LDoN adventure.  

I can get aggro easily enough without spell haste, so I never summon a
focus ring for myself.  Since I have the spells, I do summon the ring,
the choker, and the shawl for chanters and clerics that don't have
their focus items yet. Necros and shaman often ask for the Steel
Bracer since it has Burning Affliction IV.  Do the quest for the steel
bracer if you often group with a DoT'ing partner. Bazaar on my server
is way over-priced on that and most other spells. 

The Calliav spells from LDoN are almost useless.  It casts a rune
spell on your pet to absorb damage.  There's a long refresh time and,
if the mob has a DS, the shield poofs quickly.  It is useful if you
raid and the mob has a large AoE that goes off every now and again.
Usually I just heal the damage the pet takes, but I will shield the
pet on some raid encounters. If you want it, wait until you can get
the highest level one.  

Elemental Draw is a DD on your pet that puts a 4 mana/tick buff on
you.  It is available in EC.  It's what we were given after pet canni
was nerfed along with an increased mana regen from Xegony's Phantasmal
Guard. A focused pet regens the damage in within 3 ticks if not in
combat.
