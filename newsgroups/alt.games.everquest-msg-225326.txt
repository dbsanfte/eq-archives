Once slowed the sub-65 HoH mobs can be 'tanked' by just about anyone
sadly.

Cannot recommend any camps as I bet each server has different names
for them however from memory:

The level 65 human model mobs (Sgt xxxx, Ltn xxxx) are decent xp and
not too hard at all but don't count on any loot from them.  If you see
'Roset' on track I'm told he has a loot table of non-junk but only
ever dropped vendor cack for us.  I used to HoN/IC pull Sgt Hurrid
past all the yard trash stuff to the 'Garden' as he makes a great
Enchanter pet.  Some of them summon, some don't.

Avoid the Rabid Wrulans, the Recuso model mob(s) and the 65+ black
suits nearby as they are immune to HoN and have nasty AoEs.  I'm told
they drop Ornate and are one groupable but it'd have to be a good
group I think.  I had no luck at all persuading people to try them.
YMMV.

The various mobs with 'Valor' or 'Spirit' as part of their name seem
to have a chance at the nice bazaar loot although I've never seem them
drop anything.  There's a nice sprinkling of immune to runspeed
changes mobs about which are obviously bad news for root parking CC
groups plus the odd see-inviser (they actually might be undead, no way
for me to tell).

Best xp in HoH for me was with an Enchanter partner and pet Sgt
Hurrid, even though he took a chunk of xp each kill due to his insane
DPS we could clear a huge chunk of the frontal zone including the
level 65 summoners before respawn.
