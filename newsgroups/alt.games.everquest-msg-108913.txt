I found it quite funny.

Poor guy spent all that time testing his sig...
getting it just so. 

Now he has been killfiled by the very people he
was probably trying to impress.

Unless of course it was some sort of troll, in
which case, it was a pretty good one.

There's something about writing 'test;  ignore',
that makes it impossible to ignore.

He should have added 'PLZ ignore', to really give
people nosebleeds.
