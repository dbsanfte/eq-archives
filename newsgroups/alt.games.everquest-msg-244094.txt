Permissions problem yes. DX9 drivers not likely.

No offense, but this is pretty much an admission that beyond the 
extraordinarily vague suggestion in your first sentence you have nothing 
to contribute on the topic. The OP can run as an admin too... and is 
looking for a solution when he is *not*.

You 'noticed' that did you? Or did the popup box saying 'You must 
upgrade your video card drivers now' clue you in a little ;)

And the point of that waste of space was what? Do you think perhaps the 
fact that you have dsl is relevant to the problem? Or maybe it was the 
scanner and ups... or perhaps the relevant bit was the diagonal length 
of your monitors screen??

Or maybe it was just an excuse to attempt to brag about your system 
specs?? If so its long past time to stop...2.4Ghz is pretty entry 
level... hovering next to 'no longer available'.

I shouldn't expect much from a top poster though.
