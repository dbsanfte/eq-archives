Heh, I always wondered that too. My understand of the situation is
that nothing in EQ can send you a message unless its a Mob - mobile
object, even when they're static. Funky huh?

Anyhoo, When you're in the new runnyeye for example and see messages
like

"AIEEE! Something nibbled your toes!" 

or the plagues in the karanas this is done with nameless invis
mobs outside the usual zone geometry that "say" this stuff. Like
underneath a hill occasionally saying "Your skin feels itchy" or
whatever.

So; we accept that this is true, it leads to the "Pain and suffering"
messages you get when you drown and so forth being required to tell
you you've died... and possibly even to activate the death sequence.

So the zone has a mob "pain and suffering" that sends you those messages
and is responsible for finishing you off when you drown. Its just that
in lavastorm its accidentally been put within normal zone geometry
making it reachable and trackable.

At least, thats my interpretation and Im sticking to it ;)
