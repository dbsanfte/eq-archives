Yes, it's "Pedantic, aren't we?".

Ah yes, my mistake, I thought perhaps the Crushbone orcs were copyright 
Sony, and the Felwithe Elves were copyright Sony and in fact *all* the 
content in the game is owned by Sony.  I'd forgotten that it's perfectly 
ok to take all that content, replicate it again (perhaps you could call 
that copying it) and provide it, and not fall foul of copyright law.

Oh, wait, you can't.
