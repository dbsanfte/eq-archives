He's referring to it's pronunciation, not whether it's invalid for missing
the U or not. If it's spelled "qey", it should be pronounced "kay" or maybe
(at a push) "key". His rant (I believe) is aimed it being pronounced "kway"
where there is no letter to indicate the "w" sound which, for my sins, is my
chosen pronunciation.

Then again, I live in Northampton UK, where the following is the norm :-

Spelling/Pronounced :-

Cowper/Cooper
Duston/Dussen
Towcester/Toe-stir
Cogenhoe/Cook-no

and if you are one of the true inbreeds :-

Irthlingborough/Artlenot

To name but a few. Or "foo", as it is here.
