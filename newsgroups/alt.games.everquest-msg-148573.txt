At low levels as a cleric I used to regularly mop up just about
anyone.  As I leveled up, though, I found that people's MR
went up and up and up.. .and there wasn't a darn thing I could
do about that, nor could I land but one spell in 20 on anyone
close to my level.  ALL cleric spells are magic based, so I
couldn't even change angle of attack.  The one battle I was
regularly able to win at all levels was a "no spells" one against
non tanks.  More AC, more HP, better weapons and maxed
out defense, offence, and weapons skills... on the other hand
there's the "wow, you out melee'd a druid?  You must really
rock" factor to consider.

If the recent changes mean I get more sticks, I'd think
a cleric would again stand a decent chance against some
classes.
