Yes, it is the argument gun advocates use...  And strangely enough... It is
also true to the point that it is a person who consciously decides to kill
another person or themselves.  A gun does not care who or what is infront
of him, it does as it is told, by the person weilding it.  Just as a game
does as it is suppose to, it does not go screaming into a person's head
"KILL KILL KILL!  USE A WEAPON ON A REAL PERSON! KILL YOURSELF!"

Hell, when I was younger, I acted on impulse.  I even punched a person due
to a misunderstanding and got a scare of my life.  And that was before I
played EQ or any other game that came out on a computer... Hell, before
Computers had games beyond the basic programming stuff.  I got reigned in
by my parents.  Funny how parents who are suing people might not be as
forthcoming on the issue.
