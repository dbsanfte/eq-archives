Well I hit 30 this morning, Mistmoor is starting to wear me down.  Last
night I got in a group with ranger+shaman, shaman knows his stuff,
ranger is a newb.  first pull she brought like 6 mobs.  I took over
then, I was pulling no prob one or two mobs.  Then I got to the
graveyard entrance area.  I was seen and pulled back what I thought was
3, but turned out to be a whole boatload of armored bitches.  I yelled
to run when I saw them.  too late thoughh, I died and so did the
ranger.  I logged on a friend's cleric to rez us, by then it was time to
log, but I had some good xp.

This morining I log on do some soloing and hit 30.  Things start taking
a nose dive xp wise, a good third of the mob are green to me now.  A
ranger comes in looking for a group, we group up and end up going to the
graveyard.  We fight our way there, but those armored anciles or
whatever show up again and chase us out.  After recovering and some rl
interrupion, I find she's gone on ahead and solo'ed out the graveyard! 
Well I get her to come cammo me, we go back and have no problem killing
stuff, she pulled 5 of the green/light blues from the pass one time,
which was slightly tough, but we pulled it off.  Also had some rough
spots with healers.  We decide to do the jail too, but we just barely
handle the first mob, so go back to just graveyard.  She get's called
away with her main for a raid.  At this point it's been a couple hours
since I leveled.  I have just under 2 yellows, not sure if it's just
really slowing down for everyone at 30, or it's just MM.  

I go back to the entrance but quickly give up since everything I'm
pulling is green.  If I could invis I'm not sure I could handle the
graveyard, but I can't invis.  I could fight through all th greens, but
I'd probably get jumped by those anciles again by the graveyard, so I
think 30 is the end of Mistmoor for me.  

I'm not sure where I want to go now.  I was thinking FM, but never
really liked that zone.  Is dalnir o.k. for a lv 30?  Any other
suggestions?  If they hadn't revamped Casic I'd go there, that was my
favorite area at about this level.  

I'd prefer a dungeon where it might be possible to solo "yard trash" but
also good chance to get in a pickup group.
