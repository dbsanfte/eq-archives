I am currently playing EQ with a PII266, 64M RAM, 56k modem.
I am going to upgrade but am wondering what to upgrade to get the best
improvement in speed.
At the moment it takes me ages to start a game and ages to zone so I figured
my computer just aint fast enough so I was going to upgrade to 1000Mhz CPU
and 256M RAM. Would this improve the speed much of would it be better to go
for a faster Modem type?

Thanks for any help =)
Bishop
