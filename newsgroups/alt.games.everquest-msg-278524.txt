So, let's say you earn 3 AA points before hitting level 69.  The 
timeline would look something like this:

..........A..........A..........A......L

If you went 100% AA for 3 points, then 100% XP, it would look like this:

.......A.......A.......A...............L

Note those are the same length.  All you've done by splitting is make 
the AA come later.

(Actually, those are experience lines, not timelines.  If having the AA
makes you more efficient, then the timeline for the second can be 
shorter than the timeline for the first).

Some people might prefer that for some reason, but most people who set a 
split think they are actually gaining something.  They seem to think 
that if they go 100% to get the AA faster, they'll push the leveling way 
off, and they think is some balance in between that gets them the 
fastest progress.
