I have a 1GIG Athlon system with 512 meg PC133 RAM, ASUS 8200 GeForce 3
video with Nvidia 23.11 drivers, and a SB Audigy Gamer sound card with
newest drivers, this system is running Windows XP Home and dual boot with
Windows 98SE.  Windows 98 works fine but WinXP I have no mouse pointer in
character selection screen.  On a second system I have WinXP and it has the
same problem.  Now both worked before I installed SoL.  Anyone else having
this problem.  If yes have you found a fix other than just using Win98SE.

Thanks,
Greg
