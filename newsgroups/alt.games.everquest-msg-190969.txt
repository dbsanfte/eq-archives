People often stake a claim to a certain set of spawn points, like the 
Ice Giants in Halas, or other notable areas.  This is called camping and 
the set of spawns is the camp, it probably originated from Dervish Camps 
in the commonlands that actually look like campsites.  Camp check is to 
find out what other people are camping so if you just come into a zone 
you know where you should and shouldn't go.  There's no hard and fast 
rule on this, unlike Kill Stealings (KS) and in very popular places, 
Lake of Ill Omen, Paludal Caverns, multiple groups will stake a claim to 
the same camp and hope the other group goes away.  This leads to all 
sorts of hillarity in /ooc and /shout as they argue over who has what camp.


> KEI?  What is it?

A high level enchanter spell Koadic's Endless Intellect, it adds insane 
mana regen and Int/Wis for lower level casters.

> How can you tell what your faction levels are?

/consider a monster, it'll respond in different colors to indicate level 
but different phrases to indicate how it thinks of you, I don't know the 
levels off the top of my head but they're fairly obvious.
