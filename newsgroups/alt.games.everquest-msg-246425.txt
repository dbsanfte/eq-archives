I suppose one area CoH impressed me the most: The community. In every
MMOG beta I've been in, the last week or so has been full of griefers
who are just using their last days to make others miserable because,
well, "what can they do, ban me from a free account that's about to
end anyway?".

CoH had a few idiots around during the last 3 days that I got into,
but no more so than during a normal period in other betas. The
expected flood of griefers was nowhere to be found.

CoH is impressive. Not sure it'll kill EQ, just because EQ's so firmly
rooted into the market...but it's definitely the best MMOGs to come
out in a long time.
