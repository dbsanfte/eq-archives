I have never heard it argued that charisma affects mez and stun.  Even if 
it did, 20 points is generally not enough to be a big impact on any stat 
unless you are near one of the big breakpoints.  I'd certainly want to 
see a lot more evidence than one persons anecdote.  Not saying it doesn't 
work that way, but, I would be surprised if it did.
