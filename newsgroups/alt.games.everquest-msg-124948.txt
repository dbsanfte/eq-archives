"Exploit" and "bugs" are such... ugly words. Let's change "exploit" to "use"
and "bugs" to "features."

"Hey, guess what? There's one rule that never changes: YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO
USE FEATURES!"

-Much- better.

If it bothered Verant so much, I think they'd fix it. Who knows... maybe it
will prompt them to -fix- the pathing, since that does affect pet classes,
too.
