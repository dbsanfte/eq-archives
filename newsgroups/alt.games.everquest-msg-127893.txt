    Note: I'm not siding with DT on this, I think he's anal to the point of
disbelief about the all-sacred EULA that I've always clicked past without
reading. BUT....

    MapX shows other player positions, no? So would be useful in PvP to
track down players and in determining if a spawn is camped without giving
away that you're interested in that spawn, yes? Those are useful, realistic
in-game advantages. If it doesn't show other players, then my apologies for
the error.
