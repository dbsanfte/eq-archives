Mage pet question:

    1. I have been told and have read that giving them a weapon increases
their attack ability in one form or another. I have also been told a rusty
dagger is as good as anything you could give them.

Question: Is this true?

    2. I recently obtained the Elemental Defender lvl 12 Luclin spell which
creates a AC 10 shield. When I give this to my earth pet it creates the same
flashing light effect as a regular player using it does.

Question: Does it really help the pet or just make it look cooler?  lol

Thanks
