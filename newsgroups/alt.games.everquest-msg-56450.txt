Ouch. Luckily, 401p (typo above, 1p off) is survivable by my Druid, now
21. I was trying to collect ghast hearts. Had one, was hunting the
second. I had Equestrielle on track so I could keep her where-abouts
pegged but what I didn't realize is that she can see through camo, and she
has a MASSIVE agro range. 1 HT dropped me to one bub life left, then she
dropped fear on me. (Which I love it when a mob fears a sowed druid ;-) I
got far enough away that when fear dropped I was able to gate out. I was
pleasantly surprised as I had been madly hitting /loc waiting for the
killing blow to land.

I'll go back and finish when I hit 24 and have wolf form. Not positive but
I don't think she's KOS to wolf form and I -know- the brownies will turn a
blind eye to me, which is the other worry in LFay off my shoulders. Will
be safer all around.
