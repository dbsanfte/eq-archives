    That's issue one. Why should their expectations be met when their
expectations are massive mudflation? There's one post on the FoH board which
is talking about this rather nicely. Kreugen makes the point (which seems to
be the only point worth responding to) that without mudflation, or as he
calls it "progress" on high end loot that the next expansion will have
massive competition between guilds rather than a leader and followers. Two
points arise from this:

(1) The mob levels at which a level 60 character gains XP are static. So are
the power levels of these mobs. Because players still seek XP with AA
abilities, increasing the power of players with mudflation only makes
existing high-end XP content more necessary and more crowded. Fewer people
can kill more. We have monks soloing Disco in Sebilis for cripe's sake!
(2) Kreugen has yet to show that the high-end content in the next expansion
isn't all protected behind massive timesinks. As much as we hate them, they
work for separating people. If there were ten planes, each with a key quest
and weapon/spell quests that took weeks of time to complete for a guild
force, that would nicely accomodate ten guilds at once. You don't need
mudflation to limit access to content.

    Nonsense. Folks want the best gear, period. Degree is irrelevant if the
item is not situationally superior, but superior in all respects - if it has
that 25 more HPs, players will want it.

    I see that paradigm changing. Verant knows a good thing when they see
it, and as much as we hate them making long, boring key quests is a great
way to create exactly the sort of progression these top-level players whine
about. As an aside - just need the ring for my stupid Emperor key. Wheee,
timesinks!

    I also think it's because they have friends in the Dev team, people who
feed them information and who also fight for what FoH wants. Too many times
they've let stuff slip that they couldn't have known without those inside
contacts. As examples, they've said that the original design docs for
Sanctus Seru were a travesty of risk vs. reward, Furor sent an ICQ to Tigole
describing the exact stats of the AoW's loot *before the AoW had been killed
on any server*, Furor's retirement post where he thanked an awful lot of
"inside" folks.... I regard a FoH first as about as legit as a Township
Rebellion first on Legends-only content in terms of "bragging rights".
