I've been through it.  I do recommend waiting until level 16 or so.  I
started it at 13 (barely!) in Beta with my cleric, but priests are some of
the more powerful soloers pre-20.  I found things MUCH easier after launch
if I waited those few levels.

AFter talking to Stilus, you'll be sent to the Serpent Sewers.  I believe
the quickest way to get there is from the Sprawl...the zone is a
sewer-grate in the same areas as all those casting ratonga.  Alternatively
you can go into Thieves way from Big Bend (I *think* that was the
closest...), it will be a grate on the left-wall. I highly recommend
getting your hands on a map of Serpent Sewers before you go...it's not far
to run, but you WILL be running like mad with yellow mobs on your tail.
the Quest NPC has a guard near him who will kill these yellows for you,
but it helps to know where you are running to!

The encounter that you face wasn't tough at all at 16...two mobs at once,
and then one bigger mob.  It is wise to rest before the bigger mob,
though.  Then be prepared to take screenshots, because you'll be meeting
lucan. :)

AFter that...it's the joy of running through Nektulos. Not much I can say
to help you, I just hope you are good at dodging.

That's all I'll say for now...if you get as far as Thundering Steppes and
want more thoughts, let me know. :)  I'll be happy to answer any specific
questions.
