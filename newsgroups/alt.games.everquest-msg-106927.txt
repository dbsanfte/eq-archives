First of all, there is nothing to suggest a problem with incoming data, 
but you can check this yourself.  See the green numbers at the top of your 
screen?  That's your lag meter, that tells you 4 things, from left to 
right:  ping time, packet loss to the server, packet loss from the server, 
amount of data incoming.  The amount of data incoming is in bytes/sec, so 
if you are on a 33.6k dial-up, it will max out your line about 
3400bytes/sec, on a 56k you can get up to about 5000.  I almost never seen 
numbers above 2000, and I have broadband, so it's not likely to be a case 
of an incoming bottleneck, UNLESS your modem is connecting at 19.2k or 
something.  Also, your accusation that Verant is undersupporting their 
servers is rather bold, and almost certainly not true.

Well, your local tech support is wrong.  There are greatly increased 
cooling requirements for faster processors, but they are at least as 
stable as previous versions.  There is nothing magic about 1GHz, and cards 
don't deal directly with the CPU anyway, that is a function of the 
motherboard, many of which support CPUs on both sides of the mythical 1GHz 
barrier.

Do you have the same OS loaded on both?  Do you have the same drivers 
loaded on both?  Do you have the same soundcard on both?  Do you have the 
same background processes running on both?  Once you have determined that 
both computers are running exactly the same environment, and it still 
happens, then you can look for cooling issues.  Or you could save time, do 
some quick checking of the OS (background processes, video drivers, etc) 
and then concentrate on cooling issues.  High speed processors run 
extremely hot, and the failure you describe sounds remarkably like an 
overheating issue.
