To all the people in this group who have helped me

These people have to be honest re-kindled my faith in the whole
"on-line-gaming" scene

I cut my teeth on MUD's many (too many to be frank!!) moon's ago ,(i suppose
EQ is a MUD taken to the nth degree) and never since than have i seen or
experienced such a "community" sense (i played a lot of FPS's which are (for
the most part) full of testosterone (i can't even spell it!!) fuelled
teenagers (not that there's anything wrong with that we're all young once!)
just that i don't want to know that "l33t zzzru266" "owns my ass
mutherf****r" ,he doen't and nor will he ever!!!! )

Over the last few weeks i have posed many (in hindsight some stupid)
questions and my answers received have been to say the least amazing

eg i asked what my best choice of weapon would be a few day's ago and "Tukka
Yoot" posted a 3 page reply on the in's and out's of each option

AMAZING

Thanks to you all i'm now an "evercrack" addict (my wife will be sueing you
all for our divorce at this rate!!!!)

many thanks again
