Hm, my husband cant use half the programs on my computer that he now 
uses as his computer when i am not home, *I* know how to use photoshop 
and soundofrge, he is lucky to be able to use word to write a document...

Perhaps zesaraiz is using a roommates/spouses computer to do something 
that their computer cant/wont/doesnt do. maybe they are trying to do it 
in photoshop because they read that someone just posted hey check out my 
spiffy new sig, did it in photoshop...matybe they have a job in a 
company and have access to a computer with photoshop, and are bored and 
wanted to makle a sig....

lots of reasons to be using a program you are not accustomed to...
