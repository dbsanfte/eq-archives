I'm always a bit skeptical of such a long series of books. One suspicion 
I have is that the overall storyline is segmented (fragmented) more in an 
effort to churn out more individual books rather than tell seperate, 
somewhat independent parts of a larger tale.

Considering the sheer size of some of the WoT books, I guessed it 
probably wasn't the case there, but have not gotten around to reading 
them.
