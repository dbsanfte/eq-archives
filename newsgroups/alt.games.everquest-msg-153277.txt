Oh, well, if we're going to get into lists of specific *people* to
kill... :D  Holly Windstalker for sure.  And every bear and wolf in
her precious zone.  That "will you please stop following me!" chick in
High Keep.  Zigg Flinn WILL be mine in the next level or two, I only
got enough words to try my level 24 pet once, and although I found a
level 60 necro to combine for me, he failed :/ and I'm a bubble from
28, so why bother anymore?

Oh yes, Zigg.  You WILL be mine.  Or rather, my pet's.  Over, and
over, and over...

Ryou
