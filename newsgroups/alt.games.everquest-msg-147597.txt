well yes.. quite a nightmare..
a group of us had just aquired our keys.... and it was a first time
zone in, without much research...   upon entering we receive aggro.
and one of ours falls off the platform in the zonein (nice long drop
down to more undead)  This turned out to be a TPW (total party
wipeout).  Well, me the dumb cleric did not bind nearby, I belive I
was still boundin velious at the time...   Well we work our way back
head in to recover corpses and... same guy fell off the edge again...
and well I forgot to bind myself again...   so.... back to velious for
me... nuther long corpse run,  I bind myself this time in OT. we go in
and thankfully there are two who are camping the zonein and keep the
area safe for us and help us get our corpses out..

I have not been back since..  But I am eager to go back and correct
where my mistakes were.  Would love to see the whole zone.

Gluck...  bind yourself outside in OT
