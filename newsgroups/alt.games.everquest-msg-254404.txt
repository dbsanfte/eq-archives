Uh... wow.

I wouldn't cast it on a random nobody who asked for it without either a 
dot or 10pp in advance. Friends sure, group mates in an LDoN or other 
scenario sure, but joe-nobody in pok bugging me for a temp?? a dot or 
10pp minimum donation in advance please.

The people who spend their time actually selling temps in the pok 
auction 10-12pp minimum donations to cover dot costs typically.

If your temping people who don't know it costs a dot, your perpetrating 
the problem. Educate them. Most people do not genuinely expect complete 
strangers to blow 10pp and a chunk of mana on them just because they 
want them to.
