Actually in 99% of the cases the current system works fine.  The change you
propose (making loser automatically pay) probably would not work as well as
what we have.  You have a few cases that have been sensationalized without
actual facts.  Such as the Mcdonalds lawsuit.  From what is reported here
and in the news it sounds like a travesty of justice.  But if you read the
actual facts that the judge and jury decided the case on it becomes clear
that they were guilty.  That is why a judge and jury are better suited to
make the call.  Because they are there to review the evidence.
