IE, I work at a restaurant.  Most of the time I can do things with no
problem.  One day, though, I grabbed four large glasses, went the five
steps to the cooler to fill them up, and on the fourth step managed to
lose my balance and break *every* *glass*.  I walked back to the
glasses, picked up a couple to replace them, lost my grip on one and
shattered *that*.  Later on that day I broke a plate, and then later
*on* I dropped a tray of coffee cups and broke three.  Sometimes,
you're not gonna win.

And tradeskills make this seem like a *good* day. ;p
