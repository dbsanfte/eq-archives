Also, extremely important, 1 point into taunt or it will never go up.  
And if you are soloing, mash that key everytime it comes up to train your 
taunt while you are killing stuff.  Other than kickstarting the skills 
that need it, and maybe catching up on a lagging skill, the points are 
pretty useless, I have quite a few saved up that I have nothing to spend 
them on.
