Elemental Maelstrom seems to be a pretty common drop spell, I think I have
about 6 copies on my various chars, so dont offer too much for that one.
MSII (Monster Summoning II) is a lot less common, or at least it was when my
Mage was searching for it, but you should be able to buy it for around 100pp
tops. Shard of the Core, not sure on that one, sorry.
