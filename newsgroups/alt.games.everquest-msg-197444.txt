Its a billion times safer than paying for something with a credit card
in public, where it STILL has to go over the net in a way. You are
just way more likely to be a victim of fraud due to people in
reasonable proximity in real life, going through a companies trash,
etc.

Someone would basically have to have access to your computer and 
run a keystroke logger on it or be on site looking at your network
packets.

Its very secure.
