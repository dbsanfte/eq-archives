There is also a quest in the same place (Kaladim-one zone away from Gfay) at
the warriors guild (I think) for the bone chips.  These are great exp to
about level 6 then the CB belts are better exp.  Also, because the CB belt
quest exists many players starting new characters in Gfay will buy these
belts for 1-2 pp each.  So yes, you should definately hold on to them
instead of selling them to vendors.  Since a lot of people go to Kaladim
regulary to turn in these items you might send out a shout and see if anyone
is going who can guide you for your first trip.
