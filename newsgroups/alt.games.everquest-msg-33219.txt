I got a large bronze BP in Najena (fat lot of good it did my small warrior
in crafted BP... heavy too) sold it to a level 6 or 7 ogre in Gfay (odd
place for ogres... EC is the auction zone on my server)

I don't think it drops off the ogre at the entrance very often if at all,
but the ogres further in near BoneCracker and the ogre that drops the key to
Rathyl's room seemed to drop it a bit more (I also got a large bronze
gauntlets, but vendor'd those.)

Oh, and this was at level 26 on my warrior, with a 32 mage for backup (We
were camping Rathyl for the Hollowed Bone Bracers for the mage, 4 Rathyls in
4 hours, about 6 PHs, no HBBs)
