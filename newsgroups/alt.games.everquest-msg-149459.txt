I'd do some tests. Make a mule or use a different character and see if 
you get same problem.  If you can get a friend to hear you, get them to 
come stand near you and test out /say and /shout and /ooc, testing out 
the languages too.  Do the test with both your main and the mule or alt.
Not sure what might be going on.  You lagging alot more than usual? 
Maybe you are talking to people who have you on /ignore?  Tho, I hardly 
use /ignore myself, can't imagine people coming up to you and expecting 
you to respond when they have you on ignore.
