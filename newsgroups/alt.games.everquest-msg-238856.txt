}>>      So when is it okay to bail on LDoN that is just plain bad?
}> thoughout the 28 minutes we waited one of them wanted several times to
}> go in, and I said quite clearly each time that I will *not* go in
}> without the chanter, and stated why, first and most important. the
}> only form of crowd control at that point is also the healer, and
}> secondly, I will not assist someone who instantly goes linkdead get
}> points for a mission they did not help with.
}Second - You're actually *complaining* that they grabbed a mission the
}moment the group was full?  *boggle*  I get pissed when a group sits on
}it's ass for too long, I'd relish a group that intends to PLAY, not
}sit.

True, not sitting around is good.  But giving folks a minute to say 'hi' 
and discuss whether to do Tak or MM wouldn't hurt.  Or mention that maybe 
playing my tank would suit this tankless group better than the wizard I 
showed up with.

}If someone insisted on wasting 30minutes of my time by waiting
}for someone to come back, I'd leave and put *him* on my never group
}again list.
}Hell, most of my most recent LDoN's have been over in just over 30 minutes,
}you could have gotten a win and just put the 'chanter on your "never group
}again list" pretty easily in the same amount of time.

And then you, and the group you left, may get to spend well more than 30 
minutes trying to get another group together that actually -has- crowd 
control.  Maybe you can do it without the chanter, sure, assuming you have 
grouped with these guys before and know their playstyle well enough.  But 
why risk it if even one person in the group would really like to succeed 
at the mission?

}Third - WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT STANDINGS?  The only thing I worry about
}in terms of win/loss is whether I'm going to waste 90minutes getting
}lackluster XP and not get my points out of it.

All the people who give a shit about standings seem to give a shit about 
standings.  You can usually identify them by the fact they actually appear 
on the chart.  Strangely enough, they tend to be slightly better players, 
and actually interested in having the mission succeed.  Is that such a 
crime?  Wanting to win?

Of course, all the people who are high in the standings that I've seen 
were only doing LDoN in guild groups or groups where they knew everyone.  
If you're relegated to pckup groups, yeah, your standings are gonna suck 
as bad as mine. :)

}> Plus it was in poor taste to sign up for an ldon mission if a thunder
}> storm is hanging over your house anyways.
}BTW - I've played for hours through storms - the chances of a power/phone
}out in one of our storms is pretty dang low.

Aye, I'll second that.  I won't not play because it's raining, that's when 
I -most- want to play.  And usually, it goes well.  Sometimes it all goes 
poof.  During a storm is when, if I LD, the chance is highest I won't make 
it back.  But that's still a small enough chance to be a reasonable risk.  
But I -did- stop hunting altogether for the last couple months because 
Windows kept randomly rebooting on me every 5-30 minutes.  But I think 
I've finally fixed that, yay!
