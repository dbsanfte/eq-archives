Are you sure?  I was told directly by someone that they'd tried to get an
adventure but wasted their time because they needed the stone.  If its only
there as a transportation trigger, well the transportation isn't really all
that exciting, it takes you from one old world zone to another, and none of
the transport spots are highly convienient to POK books.

That would really suck, since one of the possible choices is West Karana,
intended in case you have screwed over faction in your home city.  To get to
WK, you'd naturally POK book to Qeynos and run QH WK, not far at all.  Except
that you'd have entered Qeynos and so be locked out of using the WK guy at
all!
