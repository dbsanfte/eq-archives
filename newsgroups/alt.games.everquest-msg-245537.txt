	You just described Raph Koster in one sentence.  He's a classic modern 
technocrat: everything is worked out in advance according to Theory, and when 
it turns out that the Theory has nothing to do with reality (and it never 
does), it is never the case that the Theory is wrong and must be revised or 
discarded.  It's always the implementation that's flawed, not the Theory.  SWG 
is a reimplementation of everything he tried to do in UO.  It didn't work in 
either case.

	His work is very impressive on paper, but always leaves out two crucial 
elements: human beings, and entertainment.

	I wouldn't worry too much about it.  For one thing, I'm pretty sure Koster's 
promotion was an example of the Dilbert Principle ("the incompetent are 
systematically promoted to the position from which they can cause the least 
harm to the company: management").  All of the improvements in SWG, such as 
they are, have occurred after Koster left.

	For another, AFAIK both EQ teams are in the California offices, not the 
Austin one, and at least lately they've been very good about learning from the 
mistakes of others.  A number of ideas in early EQ2 presentations have gone by 
the wayside because they were similar to SWG concepts that didn't work.  (The 
Austin folks, on the other hand, seem to have a bad case of Not Invented Here.)
