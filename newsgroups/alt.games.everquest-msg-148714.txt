Also, you can grab a chanter or bard and get them to take the mob down to a
sliver, charm, break charm and let the rogue finish it off....full xp.
This is a nice way of PLing, as the bard and chanter can pull and damage
more mobs, and keep them on ice while the rogue is finishing them off.

There is a variation on this using a monk, who beats the mob to a sliver,
FDs, then the rogue can finish it off with a backstab...again full xp.
