You can't be serious?

Sorry, but that just sounds like someone wants attention and is going about
it the wrong way, actually it sounds to me like someone is just on a wind up
and "acting" stupid.
If suicide was on the cards, well, to quote Holly Windstalker, "Natural
Selection at work"
The fault certainly does not lay with computer games or people on them, nor
music nor TV/Film...no matter how hard the parents try to convince the
courts it does.
