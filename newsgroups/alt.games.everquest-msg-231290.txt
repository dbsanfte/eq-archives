This is a question for the very old-timers.

I started playing during the Velious years, specifically August of '01, back
when the Tizmack armour was some of the coolest looking stuff in the world
(still better, yo).  Even between then and now, the game is completely
different... the removal of hell levels, the attrition of high-campage zones
like LoIO, East Commons becoming a ghost town, and the removal of the XP
penalty for hybrids.

What I'm curious about is how things have changed from the very beginning.
I know that the hybrid XP penalty was applied to the entire group, at one
point in time, and I've heard that bard songs affected everything in the
area (heal healed the mob too, slow slowed the group along with the mob).
What else has change significantly?
