 There was a post on the forum that gave a brief breakdown of those
two.

 There has already been repercussions to the rest of the EQ worlds
according to posts on the forums. Plague rat tails, green goblin heads
and blood vials have be nerfed to less than a silver in value for the
launch of the progression server. Why not just devaule them on there
and leave the rest of the servers alone? I wonder if they touched the
hill giants?

 Well only way to get plat now is mysupersales.com and its all due to
Soe and the nerf bat.
