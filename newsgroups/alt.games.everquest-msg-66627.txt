Greetings,

Perhaps this has been asked many times before, but I have to find an answer.
I have been wondering for some time how well EQ would run on a 200mhz
machine, I have been thinking as of late that I should pick up a copy of the
EQ in the small box and give it a try, and while it is only ten dollars, I
still would like to know how it would run. On the box it says 200mhz works
with, I believe, a 32mb video card. I've got a 64mb card, with 128mb ram.
The machine runs Asherons Call just fine, never did until the video card was
installed, but I realize there are some good differences between AC and EQ,
most importantly in its graphics.

Well, I was hoping that someone here might know some who has, or has
themselves, played EQ on a 200mhz computer, and could tell me how it ran for
them? (Or how it runs.)

Thank you for your time,
-Seamus.
