Hmmm. I'd have to say yes it is definately an exploit, after all, you 
have an essentially risk free way of reducing mobs to <20%.

The fact that you die doing it simply means you haven't mastered it yet; 
and only highlights how unlikely it is for you to be able to kill the 
mob from 100%.

That said, i don't know if you'd get in trouble for it.
