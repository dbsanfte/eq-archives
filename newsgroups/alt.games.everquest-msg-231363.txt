Hmm.. I get my enjoyment out of the game by helping people.. I spend at
least half of my play time on my 65 shaman in low-mid level zones buffing
and aiding people I don't know.. it's the reason I play the game.. I guess
it is powerleveling in a way, but I don't even know the people, and I never
turn down a buff request, nor do I make it hard for other groups in a zone
to get exp.. do you think that should be disallowed?  or I should be
'barred' from entering low level dungeons?  I certainly see your point, but
most of the time if you ask some guy who is powerleveling a friend or
farming if you could split the kills, they would usually let you (of course
you run into some people who wouldn't, but I honestly think most would).

And working the other way around, clerics have a knack for being allowed
into groups much above their level, a level 39 cleric has a possibility of
finding a group in karnor's castle, should he not be allowed?  Hard to make
decisions like that.
