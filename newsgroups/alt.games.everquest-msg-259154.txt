It will not effect delay, but if the weapon is sufficiently powerfull
it will up the damage. It's just that most pets (at the level people
can afford to buy summoned equipment for their pet) already do a very
nasty amount of damage, and it takes a very strong weapon to increase
that. (The kind that no one wants to give to a pet because they sell
for thousands in the bazaar.)
