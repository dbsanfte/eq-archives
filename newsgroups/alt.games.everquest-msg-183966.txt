Sorry, but they *were* pretty darned close. Short of there being a real 
life example of someone casting a magic shield on me, it couldn't get 
much closer.

As I said, commendable of you. That does offer some convenience to your 
cleric.

Only in determing if you should be compensated - not regarding whether a 
tank should be required to provide the actual component as opposed to 
payment. I have never been asked to provide my own batwings or payment 
for a lev. There's a reason for that. The point is, just because they are 
expensive, doesn't mean the cleric should not have some on hand if 
possible. That would be just lack of preparation or unwillingness to be 
the best asset to their group they can be.

In a group, the tank performing better benefits the *entire group* 
including *the cleric* - provided the cleric likes a higher rate of xp 
earnings, that is. It is the cleric's *job* to heal and buff him. The 
cleric does not hold dominion over which buffs everyone is allowed to 
have. If they are able to cast them and there is no issue with regard to 
compensation, they should satisfy their groupmates' request, whether the 
actual need is real or merely perceived. Anything less is treason against 
the group, in my opinion.

Rumble <--- *has* and *does* play a cleric
