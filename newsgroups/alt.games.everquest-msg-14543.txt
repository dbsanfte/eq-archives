Is this the same bizbee who compared putting uninvited inspectors on a
no-buff list to the crimes of Dahlmer and McVeigh?

A related topic ....
I wonder how you would react if you didn't get any answer to your polite
request?
  "May I please inspect?"
  "<silence>"
Would you assume that means you have permission?  Perhaps silence means
"no"?  Or do you phrase your request more like:
  "Do you mind if I inspect?"
Does no answer still mean "no"?  Do you consider people who ignore your
"polite" requests to be rude, deserving of "payment in kind"?
