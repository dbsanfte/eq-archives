OK, ways that the wide availability of KEI adversely affects the game.

<<<<<<<<<<<<1. KEI-powered low level characters stealing camps that can easily
sustain
   a group. This one has been mentioned before. Your response was basically,
   move somewhere else. Well, the KEIer could do the same thing... but
   doesn't. Now, camp stealing isn't restricted to people using KEI, but
   the overpowering advantages give makes it much easier for someone to do
so.
   In any case, denying that this sort of thing does not "adversely affect"
   the game is whistling in the dark.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

You answered your own point here.  It's not a valid argument because it happens
with or without KEI.  There was camp stealing jerks long before KEI and there
will be camp stealing jerks now so is it necessary to  slow the game down to a
boring crawl make it so that one or two less people might become camp
stealers??  That's quite an overreaction don't you think?   But I congratulate
you nonetheless on the best attempt I've seen yet at making a case for removing
KEI.  Bravo!!

<<<<<<<<<<2. The KEI group. All the casters have KEI. New member? Sorry, can't
join,
   you don't have KEI, go get it and come back. Your KEI ran out? Better
   go get a new one. Chanter? Well, chanters do crowd control and mana,
   right? We don't need crowd control; our tank has Virtue. We don't need
   Clarity, our casters have KEI. Cleric? Don't need you, our shaman/druid
   is healing fine and adding lots more DPS than you ever can. The rogue
   and monk don't worry about pulling aggro because first, they have Virtue
   and so can take a pounding and second, every healer they've had to deal
   with has been overflowing with mana from KEI.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

If you've been reading my previous posts surely you realize that this is a way
in which KEI is a real asset.  I don't want to group with anyone so stupid that
they don't want me unless I've got KEI anyway so this lets me know right up
front who is an idiot.  It's a weeding out process and helps people find like
minded players to group with.  KEI is a real help here!!!

<<<<<<<<<3. The caster who has been raised on KEI. Wizards who overnuke. Druids
who
   drop large DOTs on inc. Paladins who need med breaks even *with* a C3.
   Clerics who heal early, or nuke or melee then need a med
break.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I don't run into many of these players but they don't last long around me as I
get away from them as quickly as possible.  These guys are gonna be bad players
with or without KEI.  Don't see how taking KEI out of the game does anything
about these guys.

<<<<<<<<Now, I don't deny that playing *with* KEI as a low-level caster can be
nice (although to be honest I've never had it cast on a character too low
for it). But it's a cheat. Literally. It's like playing in god mode in
a FPS. The designers didn't design the game around it. The game is not
intended to have this happen. They have, after a long time, finally
gotten around to *fixing* a widely exploited *bug*.

If they set up a server where the group casting had not been done, so that
all those who couldn't live without it could move over, I would welcome
that. But the KEI junkies have been ruining the game of the rest of us
for far too long



        ...Ronny>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

How have they been ruining it for you??  I fail to see what affect these people
have on you with a KEI that they wouldn't have on you without a KEI.  You
haven't shown that at all.  Please show how they've been ruining it for you. 
It sounds to me like you're not happy with the game.
