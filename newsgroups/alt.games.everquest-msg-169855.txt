"..woe to you who are rich, for you have received
your consolation."

Why should anyone have to?

Jesus' words are plain enough when he talks of
wealth, not just in the metaphor of the camel and
the needle's eye, but throughout His life.

It is you who has the strange notion that when He
mentions riches, he somehow means pride.

Where is YOUR evidence that this is so?

Where is YOUR evidence that Jesus doesn't mean
exactly what he says?

It is no coincindence that all of the great
religious orders founded by saints were founded on
the vow of poverty. Why do you think that is so?

Of course, once "Christians" realise that Jesus
might want them to give away their hard-earned
microwaves and Playstations, their gilt crosses
and their real estate, they soon come to the
conclusion that he must have meant something else.

No.. no.. its not money... He must have meant we
have to give up our pride.

Give up your pride, as WELL AS riches, not INSTEAD
OF riches.
