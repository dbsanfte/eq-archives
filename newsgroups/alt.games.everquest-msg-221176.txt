I hate to leap to conclusions, but this sounds like a case of the
Munchies, I'd wager either the guy was really a pregnant woman or
he was guilty of playing stoned.  Any sober gamer would have put
autofollow on the cleric, leapt up, rummaged some doritoes out of
the sock drawer, and come back nuking.

Very poor judgement on his part... another pointer towards the
"friends don't let friends nuke high" club.

This delay should have cost no more than 3 minutes with a druid,
heck, ten minutes without one and that only because the tanks
would have to hoof it to Qeynos for the nearest POK book.  With a
90 minute mission duration this really shouldn't cost any but the
slowest group the mission.  But then you have 30 more minutes for
a lesser success

I agree with this; LDoN missions are a commitment to the group,
for a specific maximum amount of time, barring genuine
emergencies its dishonorable to cut out in the middle of one. 
Even with an emergency, abusing your Evac power to screw the
group out of some of their limited time to complete the mission
is unconscionable... and probably a bannable or at least warnable
offense.  If you are deep in Seb or the Hole or something, where
the tanks would have a hard time getting out, and you have to
leave, you might involuntarily evac the group because you really
can't stay and don't want them trapped.  But LDoN dungeons NEVER
leave you trapped, generally the way out is clear behind you, and
even if you snuck past mobs (assasination mission or something)
the worst that can happen is you have to wait 30 minutes after
the mission expires to get dumped out as the dungeon instance
closes.

The fact that the wizard actually took the group to NK makes it
even more clear that he's in the wrong; he could have taken
everyone to the zone in, or to any number of destinations in easy
running distance to a POK book... NK means a loooooong run thru
WK plus some NK and QH thrown in for good measure, its about as
far from a book as any lower level wizard port gets.  (worst of
all would be... wow a wizard could really screw with you if he
wanted to: Cobalt Scar is 5 long zones from the GD book and you
are almost certainly KOS in either Skyshrine or Kael if not
both.)  He's only 40 though, so he couldn't get quite that mean.
