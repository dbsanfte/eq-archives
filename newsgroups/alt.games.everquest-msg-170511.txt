The cost of another 512MB of PC1066 RAM is $250 (www.pricewatch.com, Samsung
brand, shipping not included).  Oddly enough, 256MB is just about $100
(still expensive but the math doesn't work the way I expected).

RAMBUS memory (what you're getting) tends to be more expensive than pretty
much anything else.  Five hundred twelve megabytes should see you through to
begin with, but it's really not enough to run everything, if you're at all
picky like me.

When I bought my system I didn't notice the non-standard memory and I have
to admit was rather worried that I wouldn't be able to get more later.  BUT,
it seems that although RAMBUS is "non-standard," Dell's doing their
damnedest to change that, so prices may come down.
