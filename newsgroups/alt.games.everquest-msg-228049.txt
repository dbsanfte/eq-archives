There is no problem (other than the mitigation nerf) for monks at level 35. 
The problem doesn't show up until you are raiding, or hunting in zones with
large numbers of hard-hitting wanderers that may never forget you (i.e.,
PoV, Fear, etc.).

So basically the problem doesn't really become a "problem" until 50+.  And
while I would agree that monks (and other classes) should get some "class
AAs" at 51, which would be the perfect positioning for an AA such as
mentioned above, I don't see any other way that addition could be made
outside of an AA.

They won't add a second FD skill.  They *might* modify the existing FD
skill, which some people would dislike.  The AA solution is the most
all-around palatable solution.

There is a memblur effect to FD.  It's not dependable, and if I don't *know*
I can stand up and start fighting after having aggroed some wanderers, I
don't *care* if I "might" have dumped them.  It doesn't change anything,
other than reducing the number of times monks accidentally train their own
groups/raids.  :P

Me either.  It doesn't seem very "monkly".
