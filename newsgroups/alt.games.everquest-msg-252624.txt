My guild does a similar method. When we raid (at least 12 people) we get 2
points at the beginning of the raid and 2 points at the end of the raid, and
raid leaders get 1 extra point. So as you do more raids you get more points.
When loot drops they take bids that you send a tell to the loot officer on
how much you are willing to offer..after a few minutes the highest bid is
posted and you are given an opportunity to raise or be out. The winner get
the item for 1 more point then next highest bid. So far this has worked out
great. It is easy to understand and easy to maintain...while there is no
perfect solution this one seems to hold up well and has very little if any
disputes. The only negatives I could see are some of the ones already
mentioned, but again if you are in a good guild you really don't have those
type of issues (the scamming ones)
