I noticed a huge difference in zone times when I upgraded my system from
P-200, 64MB 33Mhz, slow 6GB disk to a PIII-800 with 256MB 133MHz, ATA-100
40GB disk, all else remaining the same (sound, video, OS).  I noticed little
difference in zoning times when I went from a 26.4k modem connection to a
500kup/down connection.  I noticed a huge increase in performance when I
upgraded from a voodoo to a GeForce2, no difference in zoning times.  I
noticed no difference in zoning times or performance when I upgraded from
Win95 to Win2k.
