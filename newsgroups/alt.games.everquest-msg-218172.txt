Llyric, you're a higher bard than I am, so I'll defer to your wisdom.  Of
course, that's easy, because I agree with you. :)

I have my first 8 hotkeys mapped directly to gems 1-8.  Every line on a
hotkey counts as a quarter-second delay, so putting /stopsong at the front
of a hotkey means that song won't start for a quarter-second longer than if
there was no hotkey at all.  When you've got an overpull coming in, that
time counts!

The big difference is that I don't twist with the mouse, but rather with
keys 1-8 at the top of the keyboard.  Just a personal preference, it's
faster for me.  When I'm doing mezz duty, for example;  I can target
mob_01 - start singing mezz - look around for next target, moving as
needed - click on it to select next mob - song 1 takes effect on first mob
(while you can change targets while singing, the mob affected will be the
one targeted when you start the song) - stop and instantly restart mezz,
which will now go to the second mob - retarget to the third mob that needs
my attention - and so on...  I'm sure Llyric already does this, the above is
an example for the lower-level bards out there.
