Well let me post to you about Sony and Verant and 9/11. I have several
friends whom work for Sony and every american sony employee was sent out an
email from the chairman of the company expressing sorrow and loss for what
happened 1 year ago today the 11th. They offered words of comfort and
support as well as listed numbers for agencies that can help deal with any
emotional issues employees are having about that incident. The cost of those
services were being covered by Sony America not the individual. While I too
am saddened it didnt have a customer service reminder today. I am sure they
did far above what some other companies did for their employees.
