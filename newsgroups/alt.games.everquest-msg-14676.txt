Better question is who is not a good partner for a druid?

Obviously it depends where you hunt and what you hunt.  About the only
classes that wouldn't compliment a druid would be a cleric or wizard.

Rogue - use fear kiting and you will rule, need to kill animals only
Mage - use your DOT and his DOT, root mob
Bard - they don't really need you but your DOT and there kiting, faster
kills
Warrior/Monk/Paladin/Ranger - porcupine, meat shield that gets healed every
so often, rng/pal can heal themselves.
Enchanter - DOTs and breeze, fear/mez if problems
Necro/Shaman/SK - your DOT's and their DOT's, root/fear
Druid - if you both have multiple lines of DOT's or take turns DOT'ing or
nuking

Cleric can only heal you really and druids aren't supposed to get hit,
wizards would just keep breaking your root or drawing aggro, plus they have
to constantly med.
