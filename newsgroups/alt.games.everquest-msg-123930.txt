I wish. It would be a far better game then. Really nothing was ripped
from AD and D except the same stuff you could say was ripped from
Tolkien and such, the fantasy world setting and the races. It has more
in common with text muds than AD and D but actually manages to leave
out the best of both while adding something that neither one ever
really had:

downtime, up the ass

In Everquest generally "patience" became the
main difficulty modifier. If you have 12-20 hours of freetime a day to
play everquest, have the infinite patience to just wait at a spawn
area for the bulk of that on occasion, or the staying power to raid
with your guild for that long, then you will be the uber of the uber
in Everquest. If you don't you will gradually increase in prowess but
without a good setup of the key classes to group with or of a class
that can solo, you won't get much done.

Both AD and D and many muds differ from EQ in fundamental ways, such
as statistics making a difference. In Ad and D and many muds, str
actually adds damage PER attack while race increases your chances to
have higher str (or decreases it) Dex actually increased your chance
to defend and something else increased your chance to hit with a box
or something. In EQ you get none of that except agil having to be at
least 75 or you take a large AC hit. Having dex and agil of 120 is no
better really than having dex and agil of 80. Having str of 100 is no
worse than having str of 150.

In AD and D you, three guys and a dungeon master could meet for 3
hours and get some quality playing in. In everquest you could meet
up with four players and in 3 hours you would have got to the dungeon
you wanted to go to, been wiped out once soon after arriving and then
spent the rest of the time recovering corpses. You'd then log out
tired for the night thinking how you basically accomplished jack crap.
Depending on who you are, you may have had some fun.

Everquest is more of a vanilla hodge podge of nearly everything which
came before it in the genre, whether pen and paper games, books,  text
muds or graphical muds.

It will be more correct to say 95 percent of what we see in
Neverwinter Nights is ripped off from Ad and D ;)
