The non-game-related channel exists, it is /ooc
for Out Of Character

Unfortunately there's no way to keep people from
using the channel for in game chatter and requests...
although you can filter it out and thus not reward
them for doing so.

People seem to avoid using /shout for in game but
zone wide chatter for some reason, although this
does seem to be its intended function.  Something
about the word shout and the bright red color
perhaps.

Recently I've been raiding an area of Kael Drakkar
while another guild was raiding in a different area,
we moved all our chatter to /auction, they used the
/ooc channel, and we filtered out each other's
channel, while leaving /shout open for emergency
zone wide messages.  Must have been annoying
for anyone not privvy to the arrangement, but oh
well.  Since both raids had members who weren't
in the principle guilds, and multiple groups, we
needed a communication channel.  Rarely see
anyone /auctioning in KD anyway!
