Not only that, but beyond a certain point there is no more risk
to charming mobs with more and more DPS - if you let them touch
you, you die.  And a 1000DPS mob doesn't kill you any deader than
a 750DPS mob.  A 96% hasted, dual wielding elemental in BoT 
doesn't let you get your mez off if he tags you, and only the
very fastest of healers will get a spell off in time to keep you
from being paste :-P

In quite a bit of charming in BoT, I died once to a charm break,
and that was due to stupidty on my part.  With EQ watcher giving
me audible warning of charm breaks and keeping my pet targeted
at all times(*) I was capable of tripling my damage output as a mage.

(*) I gave up nuking while charming in order to not leave my pet
untargeted.  Very conservative.  However, when armed and hasted
my pet was capable of tripling my normal nuke+SoM DPS.

I only ever changed targets for a brief moment:
/assist <tank>
/pet kill
/pet target
was my attack hotkey.
