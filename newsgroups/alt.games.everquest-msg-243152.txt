This motherfucker is going down. I play on morell thule and have
hundreds of friends in the game. Me, and ALL the people I know will
email Sony requesting that Sunmoon's accounts be banned. I will post
messages on every board out there, Morell Thule board, Sony's official
board, and urge others to do so. Me, and everyone I know will call
Sony's customer service support, and will not stop emailing them until
Sunmoon is no longer in the game.  He has bought all of his accounts
online, and two of his accounts were taken back by the original owners.
Therefore, we will contact those owners and find out his real name.  If
he is not removed from the game we will compalin to the Better Business
Bureau.

Oh yeah, it's over.
