Yes I've really been around since Phase 3, but didn't get into it till Phase
4.  I know theres plenty of zones aimed for low-mid lvls, but my point was
aimed only for, as in high lvls can't get into.  So they can't go through
killing everything in sight.  For the how many have I done?  I've been to
Befallen, Unrest, NRo, EC, LoIO, WK, NK and many others.  Don't really see
the point in that, I can ask the same to high lvl players, and I know they
haven't been to over half of the high lvl zones, so why do they want more
zones, planes and exp paks only for them?

No I didn't miss what he said I read it.  Again my point is, if higher lvls
get zones that drops things only they get why not other lvls?

You say low-mid lvl players are sheeps cause they cause a few zones to stick
too?  What about high lvl players I can see in one zone day after day after
day, for months at a time?  And considering pretty much all high lvl players
do this I guess you better call them sheep too.

Again if high lvl players haven't been to half of the zones there is now,
why do you feel most content should be aimed at them?  And yes I know plenty
of high lvl players that have told me they haven't been to hardly any of the
zones aimed for their lvls.
