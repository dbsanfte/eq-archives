That's the rub, If your not logged on and some clown wanted to fuck
you, he could get GM and petition your name the way it is and just say
it's the name of a terrorist and if that person explained it in a way
that the GM "believed" they knew what they were talking about, It
could get changed. I don't believe any GM would actually look up a FBI
list and do homework to see if that person was full of shit. So in
fact they have changed your name from a harmless handle to a "Bad
Name". Since I have never petitioned a name nor had one petitioned I
have no idea if the GM would wait and ask you about it when you logged
back on or if it would just be changed.
But then you would have to explain your name to the GM and then it
would still be up to them if your lying about or not. Kinda sucks.

But still, you didn't know until I told you what it meant, so as long
as you don't know what it means it's OK. Yet it is still wrong.
"Easily recognized" is not so easily recognized when it's another
language.
