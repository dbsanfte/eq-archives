In a couple more levels you could try City of Mist. I saw a monk who was
lower level than I was at the time (I believe I was 45) soloing at the
entrance area. You can only hold a couple spawns, but they will
occasionally drop wraithbone hammers (couple hundred plat) Master Wu's
Trance Stick (Sold mine for 4.5KP) Kunjar, Green Jade Broadsword
(several KP) among other stuff. Of course, then you'll have to sit in
E.Auctionlads or Greater Faymart for hours or days to sell it, but it
could help.
