Is there a fault in that tool?

Of course. One should always weigh the side effects of vaccines versus
proability of infection. Anthrax might be tougher to calculate but Small Pox
has been administered for decades and should be readied again just for
precaution. The Japanese fanataics tried 3 times to spread Anthrax to the
population of Japan (and failed) before finally releasing Sarin gas in a sub
way. The effects of it were 12 dead and a thousand injured (but this is
central nervous system gas, injury is horrible). Most nerve agents are
concentrated bug spray. They will kill us just like we use them to kill
bugs.
