There is one that is excellent actually. It's called "desperate hope" and drops off
a rare named snake (Squallslither, I think it was?) in Dagnor's Cauldron. Cheal and
quite a long period of invulnerability (I had time to kill 3 or 4 mobs before it
wore off) during which you can still cast and fight. I *really* wish I'd know how
good it was before I used it. I'd have saved it for a more dire situation. /grin
