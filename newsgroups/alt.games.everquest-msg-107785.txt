    Your server is so damn FRIENDLY! :-)  I've seen a master looter once,
and I was soooooo happy. This was in Sebilis, too, where some groups can go
overboard giving stuff to the cleric, so you know I like the system for the
fairness and not because it got me more cash. I'd get the first one or two
cash items for symbol costs, then every cash drop after that was passed out
in alpha order. If I re-symboled, I'd get another one or two items
(depending on what they were, so two Fire Opals but only one Ruby Crown)
then back to the rotation. Every so often we'd also get a /split on cash. I
still remember the warrior that did that, and now that she's recruiting with
us I plan to return the favour with some help in the voting process.
