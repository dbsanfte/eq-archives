A rooted mob will always go for the nearest target, so it can interfere with
the tank holding agro. Another spell you can use is the recorring amnesia
line (reduces agro... cast it on mob), and also the agro increase and
decrease spells (visage spells). increase on the tank and decrease on you.
Sometimes I need them, sometimes I dont. Depends on the tank, and the mobs.
