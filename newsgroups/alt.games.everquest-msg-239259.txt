However it seems like the check is made before anything else is done.
You get way more "your will is not..." messages, and messages when you
use a proc that doesn't affect the current mob (Paladin selfbuffed
procs on live monsters for example) than you actually get procs under
circumstances that the proc *would* go off. Actually the way it
appears to work is that message is the very first thing checked in the
proc function (other than the "its time to check proc" check itself),
before the dex check etc.

The point is, even though you got that message, its not certain that
the proc would have gone off without a swing if you WERE high enough
level to get it to proc. It's quite possible the proc check is
happening before the dual wield check, but that it would not actually
happen (even if proc check was successful) unless the offhand actually
swung.

But, maybe it would. You proc on misses after all. A good way to check
would be to see the offhandd proc rate of someone with all the
ambidexterity/GoD offhand AAs (including the one that costs fifteen).
If it's still half the primary, then there's just an innate modifier.
If it's coming close to the primary, then it's dependent on the
offhand weapon swinging.
