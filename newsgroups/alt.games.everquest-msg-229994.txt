Not sure what the point of this paragraph is.  It's 3-4 hit points per
level, nothing close to what you were contending.  At level 6 that's
maybe the ability to take two or three more hits than a ranger before
getting killed.  Of course, if you're getting ganked by a level 25 PK,
it's even less than that.

I'd say tracksort is a definite advantage.  A ranger can conceivably
use that to avoid getting run down in the first place.  Again, not a
huge advantage, but then, neither is 3-4 hit points per level.

I certainly noticed how you backed off the "warriors have twice the
hps of rangers" claim.  Now apparently that's been whittled down to
"they have a negligible advantage which is still an advantage".

Ok, so I'm misunderstanding.  However, I don't think that's my
failing.  Please explain to me then how "You're seeing rangers
"pre-Kunark"" is germane to this discussion.  What exactly did you
mean by that if not to denigrate the position of rangers vis-a-vis
warriors?
