Just FYI, a friend runs SoL on a P2 400 with 256 MB. It takes
forever to start up (5 minutes at least), but it runs smoothly
once it's loaded. Dunno how it'd look on a large raid, or in
the Auctionlands tunnel, though... Or in a busy Shar Val, for
that matter...

If this machine is gonna run only the original trilogy, it's
more than adequate. If you want to run SoL on it, upgrade the
video card to a GeForce2 or better.
