The named 50+ froggies are non-kos though to good races (wood elf druid,
dubious to Ulump and Kaggy)

I hate swamp of no hope though just on general purposes, particularly after
having played an iksar monk to level 9 or so.

Warsliks woods at the giant fort or the 3 spawn hut is very good. I went
from 21 to 29 or so there off and on when I couldn't get a group in LoIO (or
the group sucked, about a 50/50 proposition)  The loot at the giant fort is
also nice, occasional ~30pp weapon, and *rare* forest loop (I never saw one
personally but I saw other people shout that they got one twice)
