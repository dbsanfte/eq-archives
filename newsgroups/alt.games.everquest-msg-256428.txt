my mage just reached level 23 and started buying my 24 spells for when i
level.  i was way too lazy before to go to OOT to buy my previous pet
spells, but somehow i didn't want to research them cuz i knew they were at a
vender if i ever really needed them.  now, though, the other pet spells are
research only, so i don't feel that sence of security i had before.  so
which pet should i research?  i haven't used the fire pet much, maybe once,
but i've watched other mages' fire pets and they seem to do alot of damage.
i've kind of fallen in love with the water pet because it seems to do a good
amount of damage and has pretty good hp.  i've decided that the air pet
basically sucks, except it looks cool when appears out of thin air and
starts beating the crap out of a mob.  as for the earth pet, i haven't had
very good experience with them.  it seems their root often fails and is
pretty unreliable.

any ideas about which would be the best to research?  i don't know if i want
to spend the time finding research components for 3 pets, but i was thinking
i should at least research one.
