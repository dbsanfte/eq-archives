Yeah, I didn't get a chance to get back to Droga yesterday,
but while doing other RL stuff I parked in the gator pit in
Cazic-Thule to try for some Ravenscale armor and zapped the
Steel Golem/Lizard Champion spawn whenever it popped.  I
was afk enough to not be able to time every respawn, but
the 4 I did were quite consistent at 18m:54s, give or take a
few seconds.

That's odd, since I was under the impression that all long-spawn mobs
had been variable for quite a while now.  It's common knowledge
that the week-respawn dragons are, and so is Hadden in QH with his
5.5 hour (give or take 15 minutes) spawn (I camped him for several
days, I *know* he's markedly variable).  Are not all long-spawn
mobs similarly variable?

Yeah, well, I'm beginning to wonder if I know what I'm talking
about either.  :-)  When things went screwy in the Chief room
twice in a row, after I had that room down to a science a few
weeks previously and it had *never* done anything that I hadn't
fully understood, I figured it could either be a new spawn
being added (5 in the area instead of 4), changed pathing (some
of the mobs from the lower half of the room might now aggro
into the upper half), or variable timing.  Any of the three
could explain what I had seen.

So when I ran into a friend who had been playing EQ all
day, I asked him if he had noticed anything funny with respawns,
and he said, "you mean the fact that they're variable?"  He
had noticed funny behavior in the Ogre camp spawns in WK,
as I've already mentioned.  I asked him to actually time the
spawns, and he did and said that he found 2-minute variability
in them, so that seemed to me to be confirmation.  So I started
this thread to warn people lest they get surprised, swarmed,
and die.

But now, since it seems a lot of other spawns have been
confirmed as still non-variable, I'm not so sure.
Again, I'll do some more research (including checking my
friend's notes) and report back.
