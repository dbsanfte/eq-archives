Is it just me that's thinking:

Internet Connection Required = Cable/ISDN/Modem etc
Additional Online fees Required = Standard Net access charges
ADDITIONAL LUCLIN SURCHARGE REQUIRED = Standard EQ charge - just renamed ?

Personally I wouldn't panic, my Kunark box says Additional service fees
required whereas Luclin say's Additional Luclin surcharge required, same
thing just different wordage....hopefully ;)
