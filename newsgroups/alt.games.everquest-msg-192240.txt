> Rampage? what is it, what does it do?

Rampage is an extra attack that a mob can do, that hits the first person on
the rampage list.
Mobs that rampage have a hate list and a rampage list.  Rampage is not
changable, you enter at a specific point, and that is where you remain
(well, you can't lessen your position on the list I should say.. when
somebody dies, you go up a place)

At the point of agroing a mob, a MA and rampage tank will "agro" it.
This sets the following 2 lists
AGRO LIST          RAMPAGE LIST
MA                        MA
SA                         SA

Now the raid engages, the agro list will change (e.g clerics and debuffers
will rise), but the rampage list is unchanged
AGRO LIST          RAMPAGE LIST
MA                        MA
Cleric1                   SA
Enchanter1             Cleric1
Shaman1                Enchanter1

10 minutes on... the lists would look something like
AGRO LIST          RAMPAGE LIST
MA                        MA
Wizard1                 SA
Rogue1                  Cleric1
Monk1                  Enchanter1

Rampage will never hit the MA either (if the mob is meleeing you, he can't
rampage you)

Until your at the Ssra stage, rampage won't be an issue for you guys.

Another you missed: flurry.  4 extra attacks on 1 target (whoever the mob is
currently beating on)

> Berserk? what is it what does it do?

Low hp warrior thingy.. chance to land crippling blows

Because mobs riposte.  When a mob melees for several hundred, if you take a
few ripostes you are going to be substantially low on health and require
healing (more healing requirements for the raid
Because parry, block, riposte etc don't come into play from behind, so you
do better damage.
Because some mobs AE's are directional
