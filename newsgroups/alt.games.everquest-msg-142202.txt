<bonks meemers> Yeah...ID is REAL reliable for a rogue.  I hope
you're not forgetting the "you try to kick a scoria hornet, but MISS!"
message?

Rogue CAN ID...but even at 200 skill and 1300+ ATK, it extremely
likely to miss the second skill check.  Rogues can't ever train to
"kick," and just have to hope the thing connects.  It's simply NOT
reliable enough to use as a strategy.

> Snare.. hmm is that the proc of SCD?
SBD...Serrated Bone Dirk.  Engulfing Darkness.  Although it's
usually better to keep a 15/22 weapon off-hand than to switch
in for a 8/27 weapon and hope for a proc (even with a 255 DEX).

Counting on ID and a proc is NOT good to use as a strategy...
although both are good for "I would have died if not for..." stories.
