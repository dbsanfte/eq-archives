>..... So, last night I started a Bard,.... I don't know what to do! 

Welcome to the Bardic life!!

You must purchase your songs. Take your Bardling out and start
killing. Your first few songs are only a few gold pieces. There is a
vendor in the Bard Guild in Freeport that sells the level 1-7 songs.

Your first seven songs are as follows:
Level 1 = Chant of Battle (Buffs Str and Dex)
Level 2 = Chords of Dissonance (Area Effect Damage Song--use with
caution!)
Level 3 = Jaxon's Jig of Vigor (Rest0res Stam)
Level 4 = L's Locating Lyric (Locate's targets corpse)
Level 5 = Selo's Acclerando (Makes you run faster)
Level 6 = Hymn of Restoration (Healing)
Level 7 = Jonathan's Whistling Warsong (Self haste, adds Str and Dex)

In order to use a song you must scribe it into you spell book, and
then memorize it. After buying the song....Open you Spellbook, and
then click on the song scroll. It will then be attached to your mouse
curser. Click on any open slot in your spellbook, and the song will
begin to scribe. It will finish after a minute or two. Once the spell
is scribed click on it and your curser will pick-up a grey "spell
gem". Place this "spell gem" into one of the 8 spell slots on the left
side of you screen (or wherever you have moved your spell slots to).
It will take some time for the spell to be memorized. After you are
done memming the spell stand up and click on the spell gem to sing.

Good Luck!!
