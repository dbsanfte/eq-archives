I want to try out SolB, I want to feel the pressure and the stress but
mainly I want the experience of being in such an intense dungeon; I'm sure
it will help in later levels.  Anyway, had a few questions.

1) Is SolB generally populated nowadays?  Enough to get a pickup group, or
is this a BYOG kind of place?

2) What level should I think about going there?

3) Should I buy invis potions for the trip to the camp area?

4) Anything else I should know about this place?

Thanks for any info.  Your tips earlier on going to Rathe proved exceedingly
helpful, but now that I've made a good bit of cash I'm ready to start
leveling and learning again.  Feel like I'm getting lazy in Rathe.
