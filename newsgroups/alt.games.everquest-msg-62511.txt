In the long run, it wastes no bandwidth whatsoever. You're going to view the
pages regardless of method. Doing it with spidering software actually
alleviates bandwidth, because if you have the files saved, you don't have to
revisit the site. My typical visit to EQAtlas was about 30-45 minutes long; I
viewed between 15-20 zones/maps per visit, depending upon what I needed. When
you consider what I downloaded with a spidering program, the bandwidth wasn't
much greater than what I would normally. And honestly, if your provider does a
daily accounting of bandwidth, you need to find another. Sure, if everyone did
this simultaneously, it may cause problems, but the chances of this happening
are astounding.

Yes, it's true that this hurts the site (very marginally), because then nothing
is gained from advertisements (because you no longer visit the site), but
hell... who notices those crumby adverts anyway? Half of the pop-ups are so
riddled with javascript errors that they don't work anyway. And it's really no
different than printing the pages out, in this regard.
