Rule of thumb when playing any online game - anything that isn't part of
the game gets nuked. (Turn off or disable everything you can) Almost every
single icon in the taskbar of your system represents a program running in
memory, which means fewer resources for your system to apply towards
EQ.

Before running EQ, hit CTRL+ALT+DEL and take a look at the list of running
applications. Most of them you don't need. A minimal system
(95/98/Me) will have only 2 or 3 items listed there. Explorer, Systray,
and sometimes a video/audio/other device driver. Look at the list, try to
determine what you really don't need (ICQ, etc etc..) and kill 'em all.

The more CPU and RAM you have available for the game, the better the
performance will be, regardless of lag, with a better frame-rate and a 
more responsive interface.

Check out: http://www.tweak3d.net/ <-- excellent resource for how to fine
tune your system for maximum performance from your entire system.
