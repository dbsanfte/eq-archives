No offense, but I didn't see anything in the OP's post that begged a
thesis. Anyway, my answer for the OP is yes, now is a fine time to
start grouping. Just a few points to consider:

1. Pick a nice safe spot for the group to "camp" and have *one* person
go smack something and pull it back to the rest of you. Wandering
grouping is an option, but only if you are hunting close to your bind
point.  :)

2. Be more concerned with who you group with rather than their class.
You have a lot to learn about group techniques that can make it a
blast.

3. Put good companions (those with whom you have successful group
experiences) on your /friend list so you can look them up for grouping
later.

You will learn the various roles of all the classes in time. For now,
just have fun and pay attention to what works and what doesn't. If you
want more information of the minutiae, Tim's post was informative and
there have been plenty of other posts pertaining to group strategy for
the various classes.
