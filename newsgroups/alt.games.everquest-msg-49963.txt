Well, once you hit 51 your days of leveling up fast come to a 
screeching halt. Anyway, you may want to try wyverns in Cobalt Scar
or Wooly Rhinos in Eastern Wastes (the area just east of Kael
in particular). They go down fast for mobs of their level. 
And by all means get Splurt if you don't already have it.
