I just, within the last 2 weeks, built a new system.

Soyo KT333 Dragon Ultra
Athlon 1800+
512 Meg PC2700 (Samsung, 1 stick)
Gigabyte AP64D (64 meg 8500LE)
XP pro
Antec 400W PS.

Bumped the FSB to 140 Mhz.
Video up to 274Mhz. (the LE is clocked at 250 rather than 275)
Bios set to "turbo".

I experience lockups in EQ at anything higer than that.
The benchmarks utils loop just fine at higher settings though.

I'm using the onboard C-Media sound, but the midi's are very flakey in EQ.

1024X768, Med quality textures, 3 or 4 of the new models enabled.
Fraps to measure the framerate.

Framerates in the Thicket on Luclin are in the mid/upper twenties with the 
clipping plane most of the way out. Still starts to seem choppy near the 
drummers/dancers. (20-21 fps)

Greater Faydark is ~90 fps on the new system.

On my "old" Celeron 600@900/512/32MegRadeonLE system, G-Fey runs ~28-34.
Thicket on Luclin 10-20.

I expected better framerates on Luclin but guess that I really should have 
known better....
