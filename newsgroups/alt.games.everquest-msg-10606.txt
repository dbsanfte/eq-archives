Bullshit. Don't listen to Dan here.

How the hell is anyone able to determine which are "adds" and which
are the original pull? Certainly not the person wandering along seeing
the fight. If it is agroed on someone, it is not yours to take.
Period.

Otherwise, I could walk up to a group who are engaged in fighting 3
mobs... pluck one at random and kill it, then claim that was an "add"
and not part of the original pull.
