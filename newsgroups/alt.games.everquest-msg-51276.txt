Got 64 Gnoll Furs and tailored them together into the "Patched Gnoll Fur
Bundle" Cloak/Cape thing.

Went to hals and spoke to the guy and the girl and she told me about the
taioring.  I have her the cape and she didnt give me the "Fang Of The
Wolf"

She just sid  "I will do nothing to aid beings like you"

I am a halfling Druid

Did she say this b/c of faction?

I /petition and, after 45 mins, a gm came on and said that he was sorry
that he couldnt help me right then and that he would write it up on his
time log or something.

Any ideas.

All that gnoll killing for nothing.   Im not doing all that again.

What did I do wrong?
