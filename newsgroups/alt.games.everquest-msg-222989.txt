I _think_ I've seen Ned drop the mage piece after doing the turn-in
but not 100% sure.

Assuming Rak isn't any tougher after doing the turn-in than before,
he's duoable. Not long after PoP came out, as a 61 shaman I duo'd him
with a 65 SK. We were doing a jade reaver run for a friend, with a low
50s rogue and cleric along.  Our rogue wasn't high enough lvl to get
involved and we made the cleric stay out of the fight so she could rez
us just in case. First attempt we got owned badly, chain casting
Kraggs was barely enough to keep the SK alive and we screwed up on
positioning so I got into AoE range. Even without that screwup, I
wouldn't have had enough mana to keep the SK alive. 2nd attempt we
actually bothered with resist gear, buffs (200 FR) and positioning and
it was trivial. Best place to fight him seems to be close to the
elevator. Push him into that corner where the passage does a 90 degree
turn and starts to head up towards the invisible ramp, pin him there.
Much less stressful than fighting him outside and worrying about
pushing him into the water. ... especially if you use pets. Worst part
of my final epic fight was the positioning and worrying about having
him fall into the water.  

Note, I wouldn't advise duoing him. Things go wrong, people go LD and
the chance of loosing the tear is just too big of a risk. 2 level 65
tanks, 2 healers and you should set, 

Best of luck with the fight! 

Frank
