Yes it is. The thing is though Verant would not know the players
intent. Hey, you ressed that guy with the no xp one, "yes I did, I
made a mistake and memmed and cast the wrong spell since I have them
right by each other." Okay then, see you later. I mean really there is
nothing they will do since its an accident. 

A player can't DIRECTLY PURPOSEFULLY cause the loss of xp to another
player but another player is also NEVER accountable for you REGAINING
xp or not. Maybe verant would mark it down and if they did that a lot
verant would say "ok, I don't think you are having that many
"accidents" so stop it" but my money is on verant not even marking it
down.

They could make the line of res spells most only, but what is a way
that would be bad? Yep, thats right. When buddies are duelling at the
arena and the cleric wants to save mana and just use the level 29 or
whatever res since the person did not lose xp anyway for less mana. If
a level 59 cleric without their epic is there, they are not going to
want to revive people with a very high cost mana spell when they were
duelling and did not lose xp. Verant of course would know this.

The simple fact is that by and large clerics are not out to fool you
with their resses out of malicious intent so the problem never comes
up. Very few players who really want to play a cleric to the point of
being able to res would be that mean. By the same token my druid never
ports some jackass to skyfire and leaves them there, its just not
something I'd do even without rules instead I'd just say "no I'm not
porting you."  The bulk of the players are like that, they might say
no out of meaness but they would not actually screw you.
