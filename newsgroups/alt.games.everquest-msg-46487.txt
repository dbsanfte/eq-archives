Actually...
My main is a Barbarian rogue. I'd played, with little success, two other
characters before that. When I was spawned in Halas the first time, my only
thought wash, "Why  the hell would they make a race of completely nightblind,
huge gumpy barbarians, in a region where there is  roughly 0% visability at all
times?..Must leave!"...so I did.

I sold my soul for a port to Butcherblock at lvl 3.

Around the low 20's, I got insanely bored, and remembered that I had never
actually trained, save for my first 5 points in piercing, at the Rogues of the
White Rose. I walked and boated my way from Butcherblock to Halas in a few
hours. When I got there..it was white. And snowing. And utterly useless. My own
race looks at me apprehensively. I don't think I'll be going back anytime in
the near future.
