I've read pretty much all the replies in this thread now, and a common point
to your argument against me is that I all out attacked you in a "troll"
manner.. well, with bait like the commented line above.. are you really
surprised?

To even jokingly label me ebay deserves a short and sweet "fuck you", along
with a few other comments which I responded to briefly.

My years in EQ have taught me a pretty good skill, in not wasting time on
assholes and idiots, whereas one time I might entertain an ebay or whatever
question with a long hate-filled rant, I've subsequently realised people
like that don't deserve anything more than a "fu", before I move onto
something else.

Because to other people it would come across as dick waving.
To somebody who "never saw me before" in years reading here, and opened
their first ever post by me, to see a listing of multiple well-geared
characters, including a "best on server" for that class.. well maybe you
wouldn't perceive it as dick waving... but as a "regular for 3 years",
surely you would recall yhe few years old "dickwaving" thread..

I don't think my posts were particularly uninformative.. I corrected some
things which I know to be totally wrong, and gave some other opinions based
on a monk played to the highest level in the game...

And like i said at the top... I saw some dumb shit "troll".. "newb"
whatever.. and decided you deserved the "fu and move on" treatment.  Lifes
too short to waste on people like that.

Its only because of how long the thread went on and what it turned into, did
I bother to keep reading any further.. least of all to respond.
