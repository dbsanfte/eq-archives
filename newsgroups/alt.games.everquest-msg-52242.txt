A lot of warriors were still wearing crafted when velious was released. Was
about the best easily obtainable armour for a warrior. With the advent of
Veliuos, drops from mobs were far better thn crafted (Icewell Keep armour
etc) so Crafted started to be dumped by higher chars into the market so
prices fell. Then all the armour quests were discovered for Thurgadin and
Kael and are all quite easy (to do and MQ )so again more and more crafted
has been dumped into the market so supply and demand leads to prices
dropping like a stone.

On a recent jaunt to Mistmoore I looted the talon for the BP, bought 3
Rubies (393pp) and ported about to get the BP. Most I have been ofered is
500pp and I should have took it as i cant get a higher price.

This reflects in the price of Lamentations. Used to be 15kpp now you can get
them for 4kpp cos of a market flood from all the new Velious weps replacing
them, remember the Wurmslayer for 6kpp less than 12 months ago. 2kpp-3kpp
now if you lucky
