Well Sony is raking in millions a month on EQ there are some
'engineering, graphics, etc' companies out there that would love
to see that bottom line.

Granted bugs happen. Then what? Leave them or fix them?

Granted eq is only 10-13 bucks a month. However if you
order a pizza without onions and it comes with onions do
you just say 'oh well' and eat it anyway? Or do you complain?
Get a new pizza? Does the pizza place say 'Too bad, if you
wanted a better pizza you should have paid more for it.'

You have been lucky so far.

Yet there are enough problems where you have to have 'guides'
and gms on line to fix them.
