Crazed goblins in butcherblock (a bit south of kaladim) is great xp, but the
camp is very popular. They dont run when low on hp, so this is an excellent
place to "porcupine".
I dont like the giant fort much in FM, but if you go just north of there,
theres a wide open area where no mobs path, and you can pull monsters just
from the north (stronger mobs to the west if you prefer)
