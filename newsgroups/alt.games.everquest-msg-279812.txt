Yup. I can remember not having 2pp to rub together. I would get the 
occasional random buff, and the even less occasional gift from a higher 
level player, but a) that gift was never anything as good as what a player 
at that level can now readily afford in the Bazaar, and b) it was a way of 
life for me. I didn't develop my playstyle around having extraordinary 
gear, and therefore was very interested in all the placed I could go for my  
attainable modest upgrades. I saw a lot more of Norrath then.

Me either. PoK and even the Bazaar can still have their purpose. They don't 
have to be abused to be useful. Again, this isn't about taking away 
conveniences so much as it is about staying off the fast track and enjoying 
what you can achive on your own.

It basically boils down to whether or not you could buy into the philosophy 
of looting/questing your gear as opposed to buying what someone else 
looted/quested. That style of play isn't for everyone.
