Might be worthwhile to play one a little bit, just to see what they have.
Although doubtless their entire spell-list will be leaked out a week or two
in advance, and people will dive into the spdat.eff file to find out what
kind of focus they have. That won't tell the whole story of course, since
the relative strength of their pets won't be in there.

>Also, what was it like when Kunark came out? 

Lots and lots of people made Iksars...few stayed with them. Armor
restrictions, and starting over as a newbie (a hard to twink newbie) made
most people abandon their lizards.

With good cause...iksars make (by FAR) the best monks.
