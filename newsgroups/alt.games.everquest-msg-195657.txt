No I'm not. It's a very valid point.

So, if before you had to use some strategy and mana expendature 
management to take out that camp of 6 mobs without running OOM, but with 
KEI you can take them out with plenty of mana to spare, how is it you 
don't understand why it would be considered easier now?

Seems fairly obvious that being able to accomplish the same task without 
nearly as much worry or risk makes it easier.
