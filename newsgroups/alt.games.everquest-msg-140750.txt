Ok, here's the story... I started playing EQ back in Xmas of 2000 (or
whenever Velious just came out). Since then... I have gone through 3
completely full server sets of characters (Vazaelle, Lanys T'Vyll, Veeshan).
I have played bards, beastlords, clerics; you name it, i've tried it and
gotten sick of it. This summer alone I have gone through 2 level 20's.
I'm sure this dead horse of a topic has been beaten into nothing but a pile
of rotting flesh, but I REALLY need suggestions on what I should play.
Thanks in advance.
