   It does work.  Lenny and I were using this tactic in Qeynos Hills to at level 10
to defeat light red wisps.  Lenny beat on it till he was dead, and the wisp nearly
so, then I beat on it/nuked till it turned and ran.  I held off attacking till Lenny
rejoined me (he was bound at the Qeynos SB).  We both got the exp, none worse for the
wear.  I don't think of this as any kind of exploit.  It's a feature!
   With the changes to the pre-11 game, it seems to me that Verant wants players to
get through these levels as quickly as possible.  Aside from obvious big no-no's such
as pathing exploits, I doubt if they would care as  much about the pre-level 11's
using what might be considered questionable tactics as much as they would about
"mature" characters.  OTOH, I doubt that the lowbies would be having conversations
about how awesome their 'polite was, either.
