You forgot to add "Change character creation screen to generate all new 
characters at level sixty five with full EP gear." (Don't want to give 
them Time gear. You need to work for *something)
:-)

Yes, by all means. Let's let every guild in the world go running in to 
every zone to screw things up for serious attempts by guilds who might 
be able to do the encounter. Not. It's a pain in the ass, but I agree 
with the long requirements to "earn" your way into some of the better 
loot zones. If your raid force isn't serious enough about it to put in 
the effort, stay out and let those willing to do the work make their 
attempts. It's a significant accomplishement that the members of a guild 
can do together and be proud of. Vex Thall is an excellent example.

I could agree with this one.

Unlike the apparent majority here it seems, I agree with you. LDoN was a 
great expansion. It gave centralized places for people of almost *all* 
levels to have a chance at getting groups, and some worthy content "on 
demand" to take a shot at without travelling for hours and hours. And 
some fairly decent loot as a reward too. I like instanced content, and I 
like the LDoN expansion. It's not the cat's pajamas for the high end 
raiding guids, but for the rest of us, it was fun and added a lot of 
opportunities and some damned good xp at many levels, and fair gear 
upgrades which were, IMO, suitable reward vs. the effort required.
