Certainly nice on my (now 27) ikky beastlord - gets up to 12 per tick in
around a minute. Hard to tell if it goes higher, as with bind wound to 70%,
he's back up and running very quickly.

Bit more awkward to tell on the 54 ikky monk - with the fungi and BW to
100%, it was a quick turnaround anyway.
