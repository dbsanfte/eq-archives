My news server is denying the post before this one ever existed, sadly.

But anyway.... the quest is broken. But it's not broken there. First
off, I'm level 52. Camin was just fine talking to me, as was Arantir the
first time he appears (when I gave him the stripped Ro's Breath). The
part that's broken is when you bring Challice's ring back to him and
he's supposed to tell you the story of the three wizards and give you
the note for the gnome in BB.
