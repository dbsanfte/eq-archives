Again, I will recommend www.m-w.com, since you obviously still have no grasp
of the definition of inane (even going so far as to use a definition that
includes the word itself).  Since you seem unable to do that, I will give
you their definition myself.  Empty, insubstantial, lacking significance,
meaning, or point.  Which pretty much describes the post in question
perfectly.


> Nothing I said was foolish. Is it possible you're reading into what I said?

Your post, whatever is or isn't read into it, is "empty, insubstantial,
lacking significance, meaning, or point".  It's a step beyond irrelevant. 
It is "free word association" run rampant, and then defended as if it
contained some epiphany you wanted to share.

I hope my doing the legwork for you and helping you understand the meaning
of the word inane will disabuse you of the notion that "facetious" is in any
way related to "inane".  And I believe I stated that your entire post was
inane, not just what you pointed out beforehand.

Yes, and those statements would be "stupid", "empty, insubstantial, lacking
significance, meaning, or point" if you had chosen to post any of them as
well.  Sadly, as military, national, and family pride all have a bit closer
connotation to "guild pride" than your word vomit, I really didn't achieve
the magnitude of effect I was trying for.

After showing such a complete inability to comprehend the meaning of the
word inane, and then attempting to argue without said grasp, I beg to
differ.  =P

It is interesting, your choice of words...   It appears you partially took
my advice about using www.m-w.com, but somehow got lost along the way. 
Remarkable coincidence that your attempt to define "inane" as "complacently
or inanely foolish" is the exact definition given for the word fatuous.  A
dictionary is only useful if you apply the definitions to the words they
define.  =P  It's a good start though.  Keep trying.

I very nearly always do.
