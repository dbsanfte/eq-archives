Not necessarily. Was the monk in question a bad player? I don't know 
because I wasn't there. But the indication wasn't that he was whining 
about it or that he was a cleric manasink. He didn't know about it and 
really didn't need to know about it as far as the group was concerned. 
Yes, he could have dropped weight and had his AC go up.. but if he 
hadn't said that do you think the group would have noticed? If they did 
then you could accuse the group of min/maxing.
