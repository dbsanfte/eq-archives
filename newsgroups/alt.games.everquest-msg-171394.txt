My Troll used to walk freely through all parts of Freeport. (Well, he
*did* until I volunteered to tank on a series of Lucan kills, then
started hunting guards inside the city for small xp and weapons
skillups. Screw 'em. They never liked me that much anyway.)

The belts (depending which quest you're doing) will help with the North
FP guards, who are the Paladins. (Knights of Truth or sumsuch? Been a
while since I've hung out there.) And that's also where the bank is,
which might be useful. You can get to NFP through the tunnels, and just
ignore the corrupt guards in East and West FP, or you can fix them all.
In a few more levels you could start hunting gnolls and orcs in Highpass
until you get good enough faction to fight in Highkeep. Once in there,
you can slaughter goblins in the basement for a few levels and save all
the goblin ears you get to turn into the watch captin who hangs out near
the bank. That quest will net you positive faction all over Freeport, in
terms of guards, and with enough of them you can walk freely through all
three zones. (As long as you avoid the clerics, the entrance to the
caster's guild, and that insane Gnome who runs the jewelry shop near the
bank. Man, I used to hate that little fucker with a passion.)
