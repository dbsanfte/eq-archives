My experience with this company consists of reading the DAoC vault
boards for 6 months and having a growing respect for the honesty of
the company reps.  I also played the game in the beta. Some of the
core fundamentals of the game like an appreciation for casual players,
fun profitable non level based trade skills, a useful fun quest system
(which gives you steps and keeps track of your location in the quest),
not forcing the players to do stuff like stare at spellbooks for 35
levels, giving all classes the same bind ability, etc. make the game
better then EQ. Extra content would be nice and I am sure it's coming
just like it did in EQ.  

Now tell me why their promises are near worthless?  As far as I know
the ONLY classes who are not complete are the 3 primary rogue classes.
Their stealth based skills are being worked on still.  Every other
class is complete i think and although there will undoubtedly be
balancing on an ongoing basis for quite a while that is nothing new to
MMORPG's. If you doubt me check the last patch message for EQ.
