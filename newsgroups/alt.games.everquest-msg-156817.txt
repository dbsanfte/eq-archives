Speaking of medding at low levels, a guildmate decided to make
a newbie necro, and we had fun PL'ing her through the first 10
levels with my 60 Paladin (level 1 necro with 1.5k HP, eh) and
49 Bard (AoE Slow song mostly, with SS bracer clickable damage shield).

What was really fun is that whenever she went oom, I invited
her into my group and gave her a few hits of the Bard mana
song with Amplification on.  *whoosh* goes the mana bar to full.

Then a pulse of the level 49, 2.5 minute duration Selos song,
and she was good to disband and turbo across the newbie area
some more.
