a) My understanding the mana efficiency is hosed on those. they cost like
double mana for the same effect. I did see something interesting in the EQ
RPG Players handbook (Pen and paper rpg) though, that may be a clue about
the 'proper utilization' they speak of when people speak ill of Al Crapbore.
In EQ Pen and Paper there are two types of area effects: Burst (boom) which
is blocked by intervening terrain, and what I think they called spiral,
which swirls around walls to give max are effect. Al Crapbore was 'spiral'
damage.
b) Also, there's no 5 target snare afaik.

Take the above with a shaker or two of salt... Dammit Jim I'm an enchanter
not a nuker!
