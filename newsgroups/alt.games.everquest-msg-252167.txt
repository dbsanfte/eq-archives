It really ought point out the stupidity of conducting business using a 
transaction process that explicitly states that digital content is not 
protected.

Paypal is right, they have no way of establishing delivery or 
non-delivery. Thus the dispute falls to Sony where they can actually 
establish delivery. And Sony's EULA du jour clearly states they are not 
getting involved with plat sales, and the inherent risk of fraud.

Thus while the scammer committed fraud, and deserves to be prosecuted, 
but the plat seller was conducting a business with absolutely no legal 
protection... they *knew* they couldn't get recourse from neither sony, 
nor paypal. It was a disaster waiting to happen to them, they should 
have seen it coming miles away.
