    Veksar was, for me, Everquest's last hurrah, really. A solid zone, camps
I could duo, that dropped upgrades for me at that point.

    Yeah, it was good money too, and I suppose if you were a solo necro with
hours and hours to kill, you could perpetually camp shop or something for
the occasional 24k drop.

    But seriously, you've skipped the best 65 levels of the game. That's
like skipping the first six weeks of vapid sex and pure attraction/fallen in
love of a relationship in order to have the last six months of living
together because you signed a lease but hate each others guts. Or something.

    Anyhow, not sure what the point is (drunk) but yes, Veksar is good.
Especially in context (getting there after actually playing the game to that
point)

Cheers,
