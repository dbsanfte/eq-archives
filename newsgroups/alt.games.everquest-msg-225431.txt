It used to be that if someone wanted you to join their group, they'd ask,
even if you were on LFG.  "Hi, want to join us for a dungeon?"  That's all
it takes.

Nowadays, folks just TELL you when you're on LFG.  "Come to Oasis."  "North
Ro for adv."  "Meet us in PoJ."

I mean, I'm grateful for the group and all, but I'd kinda like to hear that
little bit o' courtesy.  Yanno?

I'm gettin' old before my time, guys, old before my time.  Whar's my cane?
