Velk drops  a clicky nuke for a wiz, about 150 damage or something.

I have these at the moment:

Eyepatch of plunder (4sec cast, worn)
8th Coldain Ring (instant, worn)
Dark Cloak of the Sky (instant, inventory)
Amulet Of Necropotence (instant, inventory)
Spyglass (instant, inventory)

I want the clicky shield from plane of hate, has clicky resist disease on
it, which rangers dont get (only get fire / cold resist buffs).
