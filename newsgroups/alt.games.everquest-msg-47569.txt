Ok, I'd like one of you brilliant business executives to show me where I
said competition was bad.  Or where I said improvment in EQ was a bad thing.

That's right, I never said any of that, you crazy fanbois.

What I am saying is that EQ is overreacting, and that's a sign of fear.
Panic is not a good thing.  Releasing "documents" that say something very
much like "yeah, it's gonna be a lot better.  Somehow." is a not good
business, but just plain silly.

Think of it this way.  If one of you ever managed to have a girlfriend in
some weird alternate universe, but you started spending time with this new
girl (boy, I know I'm stretching credibility here).   And your old
girlfriend started saying "No, don't leave!  I'l..I'll..I'll be better! I
promise! I'll do A!  Yeah, A!  and uhmmm..B!  And C!  You always wanted C,
right?  So yeah, C! And and and later I'll do D! And E! And get this, F!"
It would sound kinda pathetic, wouldn't it?

Well, welcome to the Friday announcements for EQ.
