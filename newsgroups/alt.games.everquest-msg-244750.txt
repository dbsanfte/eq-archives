Don't know which resists to raise though it is likely that it is a
Magic Resist if anything. OTOH, though not applicable at this point,
as you level up you will likely find that you will successfully resist
their blind ability more and more -- though they will have greened out
by that time. In any case, you'll end up with a blank screen almost
all the time.

My ranger (was mid-late 30's) was kiting zeliniaks and get the
occasional lightcrawler add. I tended to turn towards the crawler so
my weapons would hit (clear the zel from the target box and the next
hit from the crawler would target it) -- having cast one last fear on
the zeliniak to keep it going away -- and would nuke away. After my
first experience with blindness (blank screen), I made sure that I
knew what hotkeys or spell gems were my nukes.

Having a buddy would make it safer/easier, so a group would be nice if
you can find one.

HTH
