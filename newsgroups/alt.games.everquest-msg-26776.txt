A spoonerism, like an anagram, is not a misspelling nor an
alternative spelling.  All of those words have clear specific
meanings, and you can't change one into another by simply 
boggling at it.

Words have meanings.  Learn what they are.

Acceptable according to the SPECIFIC WRITTEN RULES.  Not acceptable
according to the spirit of the rules, but that's a different issue.

Are we clear now?

Yes, they can.  That was not what was being discussed however.

The best way to call them on it, however, IMNSHO, is to first amend
the naming rules to clearly prohibit the class of names that Verant
has decided skirt the current rules but still "ought" to be prohibited.

It is not simply to say, "well, that name doesn't actually violate
any of the specific written rules we laid out, but we still don't
like it, so you're screwed anyway".

And this was the nature of my point.

If you're going to write lengthy, specific rules which delineate
what is allowed and what is disallowed, then you should actually
use them as the criteria for action.  There should not be
an unwritten rule on the end which says "or anything else we
damned well please", since that makes everything that came
before it meaningless.

If Verant wants to amend the rules, they can do it at any time.
But I will continue to object if Verant, or other players,
try to force someone to change a name that is *not* an actual,
specific violation of the rules as they exist at any given time.

It's like the Mystere banning which caused such an uproar --
what honked most people off wasn't so much that Verant wanted
to prevent people from publishing "racy" EQ fiction, it was
that they had previously had no stated policy on fanfic that
was not posted to the Sony boards, nor did such behavior fall
under the existing list of bannable offenses, but Verant
BANNED HIM ANYWAY the instant they decided they didn't like
his fiction.

It would have been an entirely different story (no pun
intended) if Verant had instead posted a new criteria to
the "these things are bannable" list to cover sexually-explicit
offsite EQ fiction, and then gave people a little bit of
time to come into compliance with the new rule before they
started banning people.

It's a simple matter of "say what you mean and mean what you say".
If the rulemakers don't pay any attention to their own rules,
the "ruled" quickly learn not to count on anything the rulemakers
say.

Me too, but I'd also like to think that there's still a sense of
fair play and justice among the people who make and enforce the
rules of that world.  Let it be a "nation of laws", instead of
a "police state" where none of the inhabitants ever can know
if they're crossing over a line until they get hauled away:
