Yep - Silver Swift Blade is the one, but if you think that is bad for aggro
don't forget I have SCHW equipped as well. Things would really get
interesting if I grouped using my current dual 1hs as well:  two
Lamentations 9/19.

I have just hit level 22 and with  double attack on top of my dual weild my
little Rangette is a 3 phase food processor. They are great weapons for
raising all my combat skills especially dual weild and double attack.

But that is the benefit of soloing, you don't have to worry about aggro as
no matter what you have aggro all the time anyway. I will think about
grouping when I hit 40 or so, but I already have my next set of 1hs banked:
Velium Axe of some Brood thingy with a 85p DD proc and a Jagged Blade of
Mourning.

Currently wearing an Ikky Breatplate which is keeping me out of trouble
somewhat, and all the HP gear I have on means my Ranger self Buffed at level
22 just tops 1Khp and has 580'ish AC though my defence skill is about 25
points behind.

If I group at all in the forseeable future it will be a duo with a rogue and
maybe a cleric if I can find one patient enough , but downtime at the moment
is still very low.

Gotta love the Bazaar : )
