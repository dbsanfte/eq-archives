The snare alone, whether it sticks or not, does not generate enough hate 
by itself.  Which is why you cast it multiple times until it sticks, then 
you load up on DoTs, sick the pet, and keep refreshing the DoTs and snare 
as needed.  You don't sick the pet until you have solid enough agro that 
you don't think you will lose your pet.
