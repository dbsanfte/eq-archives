It's not a quest. The JCP drops off of the Chancellor of Di'zok, a
level 40 sarnak shaman deep inside the castle in Lake of Ill Omen.
It's droppable and can be bought for about 500 plat on Torv.

You can probably get a better weapon for the money, though. The JCP is
half of the key to Howling Stones, so many high-level characters with
more plat than you are looking to grab it.
