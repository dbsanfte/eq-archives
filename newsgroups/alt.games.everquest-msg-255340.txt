I disagree. Which is more difficult, getting yourself prepared to kill a 
single force-appropriate target or getting 30 or 40 people organized and on 
the same page to kill a single force-appropriate target? 

I feel that being able to act in concert and execute a successful strategy 
*should* be rewarded. This does assume that the encounter *requires* this 
and doesn't just hinge upon a couple of uber-geared meat shields with a CH 
chain and a slower.
