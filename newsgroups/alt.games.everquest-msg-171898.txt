I have too, but...  I cannot recall ever getting Offense, Defense, or
a weapon skill off a no exp mob with a character above level 20 or so.
And the likelihood of skill-ups seems to scale with exp awards, i.e.
low blues aren't much better than cyans but yellows are great <if>
you're good enough to hit frequently (don't expect to hit the Drolvarg
Rager very often when you're L40 and have a 17 weapon skill, but at
185 skill you're likely to cap reasonably quickly).
