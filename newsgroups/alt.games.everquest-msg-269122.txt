Which would be a much more interesting means of furthering your guild's 
reputation or levelling the guild up, so to speak. I like that idea. 
Serving the city by exterminating the rat population doesn't have to be the

could be included as well.

I'm no fan at all of the various leader boards, discoverers lists or other 
methods of phallus-waving they've implemented with EQ2, either. They smack 
of cheap sell-out tactics to me.
