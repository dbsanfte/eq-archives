How much damage does gravity flux do if you don't have a rudimentary
safe-fall skill?  I've never considered it anything more than a slight
bit of fun in the middle of the battle.  Of couse it's even more fun
with the Icy Terrors in Permafrost.  Those bastards use a knockback
spell that will shoot you across the room, up the wall, and bounce you
off the ceiling if you get them in the right place.  Probably the most
laugh-out-loud fun of any mob outside of PoM.

Zone right, rez left.  Please!  At least I expect it going into KC,
nothing worse than coming out of KC into DL and running into a bunch
of angry ragers.

Is getting Velk to zone uncommon on your server?  I've been in zone
several times when it happened on Innoruuk (in the pit every time
thankfully) and hear about it in /gu at least once a week.  Of course
I've fucked up the pull and sent castle mobs to zone myself, but only
wiped out the village group.  I've been in the village when that
happens too, and learned that if you see castle mobs running by, sit
and quit, fast!
I did see a great train there yesterday.  Warrior, 2 sks, monk, and me
at the first rock ganking spiders, 60sk says shit, and we see him run
past us with a spider on him, so we run to zone to help, not really
understanding why he's running from a single spider.  We turn the last
corner to zone out, and get hit by the backwash of the biggest train
I'd ever seen, SK drops in about 1 second, the rest of us made it out
with less than a bubble of health each.  I was still buffed from raid
the night before so I had about 3000hp, rest had similar hp.  I didn't
even see what hit me, just whamwhamwhamwham ZONE!
