Well, duh!  That's why people are so afraid of dying!  If they die,
they'll have to spend forever looking for all those buffs again!

/sarcasm off

But seriously, this may be part of the issue.  I know that, when I set out
from PoK, I'll often pause to get some level-appropriate buffs/MGBs; after
all, the content I'll be facing has often been tuned to expect me to have
those buffs.  And often, especially if I'm grouping with friends, we're all
in PoK and all of us are getting those buffs, so I'm not holding up the
group.  If I die, though, I won't make the rest of the group wait just so
I can find the buffs again before I rejoin them.  (And if I'm being rezzed,
I can't keep any PoK buffs anyway.)  That means that, if I die, my output
afterward will be lower because I'll be missing some buffs.  This doesn't
paralyse me, but it does mean I may skew my tactics to reduce the chance
of dying.  Of course, from a role-playing view, this isn't necessarily a
bad way to skew. :-)
