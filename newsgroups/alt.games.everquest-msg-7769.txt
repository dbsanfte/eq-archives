I'm going to be out at E3 on thursday, 17 May and would like to meet up with
anyone from the ng that will be there.

We were going to have a demo to show off but we blew the deadline so I'm going
to have a lot of time for socializing.

Anyone who doesn't know what E3 is like can read my report from last year at:
