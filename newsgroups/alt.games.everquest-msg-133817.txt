}Just me, but I'd MUCH rather get no answer than one that is wrong.

Oh, me too, definitely.

But I think I'd prefer a wrong answer followed by someoe corecting it to 
either of those cases.  With extra points for references included, and 
extra double bonus points for providing the correction without being 
snooty about it.

(Hm.  I wonder how often I live up to my own standards... probably not as 
often as I'd like, alas.)

I've noticed this curious effect.  A question is asked, where a lot of 
people aren't 100% sure, so no one answers.  But as soon as someone 
provides a wrong answer, it -suddenly- becomes worthwhile for someone to 
check, so they can correct the original followup.  That erroneous answer 
is now valuable, because it got the ball rolling.
