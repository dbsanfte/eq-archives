    How so? Cap. med rate is 26/tick, so you're looking at an extra
1.3/tick, which I imagine is rounded down to 1/tick. LOOKS like a FT1 item.
If anything, that's what makes me wonder about what +5% med even means - I
have yet to see anyone correlate Med skill level to mana/tick rate. Anyone
bothered to do testing on this?

    If it were +5% BASE mana regen, the Cloak would be fine as is. If
anything, older FT1 items could be said to be too difficult to get, given
the minor value of the effect.
