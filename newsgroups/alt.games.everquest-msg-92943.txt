You should probably be good to go if you have a tnt card. It seems
that NEWER FASTER processors have more problems with Luclin than
older p2 or p III 400's, why I don't know. If you look at the EQ tech
board MANY people with a combo of AMD proc and nvidia cards are having
problems.

My system is rock solid, it does not have the best framerate but it
also never crashes, never has trouble patching, never crashes after
zoning, never has messed up graphics, etc. I have:

P2 400
tnt 16 meg agp nvidia card
sound blaster PCI 128
asus 440bx p2b mboard (newest bios possible)
576 meg ram (vcache set to max of 90 meg in win 98, so as not to 
run out of memory addresses since over 512))
750 meg perm swap file
Texture cache set to on in EQ
Textures set to low qual in EQ
Regular old world textures in EQ
EQ/KUNARK/VELIOUS/LUCLIN
Running cacheman

ALL Luclin models and social animations on.
Have umbra/dpvs working well and not turned off in the eqclient.ini
(this is a great boost, makes it so only the polygonal stuff in my
view is rendered, its also a software boost and works with any video
card - if it works at al. Mostly I notice this in areas like shadow
haven where buildings block my view of other buildings.)

Nvidia 21.83 WHQL video drivers (the newest ones gave me some
problems, specifically not shoing fine lines of buff boxes and things
in transparent view.) Older drivers are kept at www.guru3d.com.

And I play quite well. When done playing I usually see, from looking
at cacheman's stats, that I used all 576 meg of ram while playing
Everquest and up to 595 meg of my swapfile. The only problems I have
are on guild raids with like 25 plus people, then I turn off character
names, dynamic lights, etc, filter lots of chat and other spam and
make sure I have /serverfilter ON. I'm also not a melee type, so my
druid turns its back to everyone and has virtually no lag while it
targets people to heal and what not. If it is going to cast on the
mob, it simply hits /assist whoever the master tank is. This again, is
the umbra/dpvs working, which is very nice. Essentially she looks at
the wall or the floor and has zero graphics lag.

I'm very satisified with my luclin performance on this system and my
next upgrade will probably be a geforce 4 128 meg graphics card like
the 4200 for around $199. The video card seems to be what is holding
me back right now more than my proc. At this stage I'd have to upgrade
my MBOARD again as well as the proc and due to all the myriad of
problems people with newer boards and procs are having on the tech
board I'm not very keen on this until I really need to. Outside of EQ
any other apps/games work great still. I'm not one of those people who
require 60 frames per second.
