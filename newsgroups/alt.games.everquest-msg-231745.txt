Ignoring current instancing bugs (i.e.. its not instanced..)

The general rule of thumb for 3 guilds as i see it is
6 day respawn, 2 days to clear, that allows 3 guilds a slot in the rotation

3 fits into 6 perfectly.. 4 doesnt

Whilst some guilds can (and do) clear potime in 1 day... its not really
advised. Most >quarm guilds raid twice a week (potime), then sit around for
4 days a week with thumbs in asses.. trying to find targets. Clearing time
in a day would just add an extra day to try and find targets

As for specific numbers to bug it.. well its bugged on many servers at
present with just 2-3 guilds in.. thats mere glitches tho, not permanent
issues

PoTime will only allow one raid force (and 72 peeps max) inside at any 1
time. You cannot enter potime under another guilds session either
