Played the beta, not a bad game but tends to be very impersonal.
Grouping bonuses are great but basically you will get invited to group
and people in your group will take the bonus you get from it and run
off and solo.

It's all about the space ships. If you love flying around in
spaceships and building it up; this game is for you. Think of it as
watching Star Trek where the show is mostly about watching the
Enterprise fly around blasting things and such. Character is nothing
more then a means to get quests, trade skills, buying/selling.

Nice looking game, but too impersonal for me.
