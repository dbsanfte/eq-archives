If you're trying to get to level 60 fastest you can do what the above
powergamer does.  And yes, it's boring as hell.

OR you CAN do adventuring.  Norrath is HUGE.  Without teleportation it takes
over an hour to run from one end of the ORIGINAL game to the other.  Then
add 2 expansions (not talking about the moon yet), neither of which is
small.

Overcrowding is NOT a problem...actually, undercrowding (if that's a word)
is more likely.  Unless you have friends you're more or less forced to
either solo or gravitate to the most crowded zones in order to get a group.

Or you can fish.  Or do tradeskills.  Or do quests.

Everquest is a virtual world.  It can be addicting and I don't recommend it
to anyone who has a life.  If you are married I'd recommend buying a second
computer, second account, and talk her into playing.  If you have a small
child, go play with him/her instead of buying the game.

If you decide to play, buy the Trilogy (everything but Shadows of Luclin).
Your graphics card should be able to handle it, though I'd still upgrade to
an ATI or GeForce (2,3,4) when you can afford it.  Your RAM is ok, though
I'd upgrade that to 512 as well.
