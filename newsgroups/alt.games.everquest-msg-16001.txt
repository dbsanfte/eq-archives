My Pally seems to have good faction in most places, but for some reason, last
night I was ported into NK and was promptly bashed to death by Brian or Briana
Treewhsiper.  It sounds like a druid name, but druids don't seem to have
anything against me.  Any idea what I could have attacked to effect the
Treewhispers and my relationship?
