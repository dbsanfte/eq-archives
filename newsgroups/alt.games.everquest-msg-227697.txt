That may be true in general but specifically both warcraft 3 and age
of empires were both rather poor games. Blizzard has been resting on
its Diablo and Starcraft laurels too long and MS's rts games have
never been particularly good. Warcraft's problems were mostly about
its clickfest nature and poor balance, Age of Empires was just too
little strategy too much early zerg due to the unit number limit.
