Try a mage, I move-logged my mage at lvl 48 and was able to solo with her
easily with no gear at all on (this was before you could move log with gear
and items). I wound up soloing her till 55 or so before I found a guild that
suited my play times and didn't wince away from my still half-naked and
poorly equiped character. As a mage I can still solo somewhat reliably at
lvl 65 and finding groups hasn't been a problem either, people love the
damage output of a mage :)
