Shaman epic is damned near useless for a raid, sure I can put a clicky 
dot on the mob, but, realistically, for a raid target, it's just not that 
much damage.  The main use of the shaman epic is soloing, and stats.  I 
have yet to see any item drop that I would trade out for my epic based on 
stats alone.  I know they exist, but, not at my level of play.
