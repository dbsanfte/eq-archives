As a 51 mage, I'd love it if everyone trained every AFK xp
camp they ever see a mage using.  VI insists our pets are 
overpowered, and their ability to solo low/xp giving mobs is
one of the reasons.

Take away all the stupid reasons they think mages are 
overpowered, and maybe they'll do what it takes to help
us find a role in raids.

Personally, I think the Epic was the biggest mistake 
they ever made - most of it's utility for a soloer comes
from it's huge HP/DS.  Mages with epic pets by definition
engage in epic encounters/raids.  The pet should have
been geared toward helping them there.  The epic pet should
have been a low ac/low hp - High level/atk rating pet 
capable of inflicting decent damage against 60-65 mobs.

Think Rage of Zomm with 1k hp (to give mage's enough time
to heal them from ripostes/ae's)

Grrr, that list of question/answers from Alan has got me
disgruntled still.  Enough so that I recreated my original
bard on my current server and have him up to 14.
