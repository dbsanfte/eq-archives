You leave me puzzled here. In your first paragraph you mention blizzard
could lock the mob to the first person that hits it. In the next
paragraph you said blizzard gives all the reward to the person that hits
the mob first instead. I can't really see the difference.
By all means they *have* locked the mob, haven't they?
