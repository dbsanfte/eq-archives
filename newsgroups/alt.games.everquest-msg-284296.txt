I'm finding the zone populations to be about right at this point. I'm 
glad I waited.

My sentiments exactly. That's really the basis for my indecision.

Bard was my main (such that it was) on FV. Though the class was great 
fun, I ran into the wall of endgame itemization rendering me an 
inadequate slot expense in many group/raid situations. Of course, this 
was exacerbated by the fact that I was a high-50's bard in a guild 
comprised mostly of 70's with a gazillion AA's. The last straw was the 
bugging of swarm kiting (not AoE kiting - I never tried that). I just 
ended up disillusioned with the class, I guess.

As far as druids go, I'm sure you're right. However, I do recall never 
worrying much about not getting a group well into my mid-30's, as I could 
solo pretty effectively, of course. ;)

Ugh. Didn't consider that the fact that armor and focus items weren't in 
the original game.

I always disliked the idea of buying my spells, and resented having to 
consider doing so. The first couple of spell circles requiring research 
weren't too bad, but the higher level I got, the exponentially more 
tedious it became. It really is a poor system.

Yup. Forgot about that.

Hmm. All good ta know. This one will continue to be in the front running.

Yeah, I was actually only considering druid as an afterthought, as there 
are other classes I would much rather play.

Now, I *do* remember feeling like I couldn't contribute much to a full 
group as a young necro, as my DoT's never had time to do much good, but a 
group that was knowledgeable of the necro's capabilities and would let me 
pull/CC could have made all the difference.

I appreciate the insight. As far as narrowing it down goes, I'm thinking 
that perhaps I didn't do well enough, as exhibited by the fact that I 
dinked around in the character creation modules for about thirty minutes 
last night with no result. :P

No way I'll catch you, shorty. :P  Btw, 43 in less than a month?! You 
need to go make some swords or something. ;)
