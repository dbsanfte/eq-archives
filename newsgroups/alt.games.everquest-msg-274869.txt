Monthly. $12.95 for EQ1, I believe. $14.95 for EQ2? Or something like
$24.95 for their access pass which grants you a subscription to all of
their titles (EQ, EQ2, Planetside, and (soon, I think) SWG along with
other minor Station games).

Before you ask, the reason for the fee is running a persistent world
is HUGELY more costly than running, say, a Counterstrike server or
Battle.net.
