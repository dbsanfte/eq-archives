Hehe, yep. Thats even more bothersome than newbies, when people try to say they
are newbies just to get help,

Several times i have been sitting in Kelethin helping people, and get a tell if i
could port, for free of course, since the guy is a newbie and have no money.
And when he show up he is wearing stuff thats worth around 10000pp more than my
level 33 druid run around with, and was just playing newbie to get a free port.

People like that are even worse, since ist more those people that make me think
twice about helping new people, than the newbies themselves.
