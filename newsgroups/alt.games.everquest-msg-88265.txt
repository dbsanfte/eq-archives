Ok, after tons of fucking around, I *seem* to have EQ back in working
order. I tried the 3211 drivers from NVidia as reccomended but still had
the same shitty performance that I had with the 2180 ones that Verant
had.

Went to the NVidia site archives in desperation and tried the 2183
drivers. Restarted, ran EQ, and I'm back up to full speed. (Note, I'm
still with most models off and low texture quality, but it's back up to
full motion frame rates. Will try turning that stuff back up next. 

But in case that can help anybody else who's been fucked since the
patch, good luck.

Again, I have a P3 600, 512 MB RAM, Win 98 SE, and NVidia GForce 2 MX
400 with 64 MB RAM.

The NVidia new drivers I installed seemed to have gotten me back on
track.
