Your discription happens often but there is a specific reason for it. Agro
Management is the biggest thing for any melee class to have to work on. For
rangers, it is their number 1 concern. Deciding when to snare is part of that. It
comes down to evaluating that Risk-Reward equation. Rangers risk the chance of a
runner for the reward of less agro and therefore less healing mana. Reduce the
risk for runners, you increase the amount of healing mana needed for them.
