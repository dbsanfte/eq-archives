I don't mind that it's fee-based.  I just won't use it ;p

I do appreciate that they're giving us an in-game MP3 player that
looks like it's going to be free, though.  Sure, sneaky-amp works, but
it's kind of a pain in the ass to work with (ie finding trigger words
to use that do *not* include your 'auto attack' button ;p)
