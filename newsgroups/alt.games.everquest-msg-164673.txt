Suddenly I don't feel so old.

Anyone remember intellivision, Snake was called Snafu?  And yep, I played
Oregon Trail, but we had a computer before our school did.  I remember it
well, an IBM PCjr with 2 keyboards no less, loved that baby.

Summber Games, I played on a friends computer, she also had Carmen Sandiego
and Castle Wolfenstein.
