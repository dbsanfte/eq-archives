Ah, I thought they had some sort of little used offensive disc.

The idea is not to replace defensive for the MA/SA, but rather to give
the third, fourth, fifth, & etc. Warrior on a raid a little something
extra to contribute when you finally get to the big boss.

The reason I suggested it as a disc rather than AA was, first, so
that it would be available to all Warriors of the appropriate level,
and second, it would be less "unbalancing" since it would take your
other discs out of play for a while rather than being a straight-up
addition to the Warrior's power.  My motive was to try to partly
mitigate the "Warriors don't stack, get a real damage dealer" thing
without damaging the role of the Rogue/Monk.  They made Paladins
more viable, in part, by adding situational strengths to the class,
this is an suggestion for a way to do something similar for Warriors.
