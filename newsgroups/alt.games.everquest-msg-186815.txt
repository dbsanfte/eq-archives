Wow, lucky.  Our Chapters is smart enough to realize that some assholes 
will trash the books if they're allowed to combine them with foodstuffs, 
so no unsold merchandise is allowed in the lounge.  However, that's 
okay.  I browse for an hour or two (can you ever spend TOO much time 
luxuriating in which books to buy?), get what I want, *then* go over and 
get myself a tea and a little chocolate cake, and sit by the fire and 
read.
