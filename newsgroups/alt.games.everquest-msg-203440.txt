Heh, no. If I had wanted to flame you, you'd have been flamed :) It's 
just that I'm amused that you think that a reduction in the xp delivered 
by a particular play style has *any* relation to your ability to 
roleplay in that style.

Hell, the most "roleplayish" choice for a solo character is the Rogue. 
Admittedly, you'll make SFA xp, but you cannot have your cake and 
roleplay it too.
