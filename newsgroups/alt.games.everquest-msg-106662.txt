ah, interesting, In all my time in EQ I've never noticed this, so I decided
to try it out. I went to WC with a 10th level character and pulled a bear to
the WC druid ring. there was only one druid still alive there (not the
merchant, one of the three in the back) and I took my bear to him and
proceeded to slaughter the bear under his nose. He didn't care. He didn't
attack me or interfere in any way.

Second test: took another 10th level character.. ran from Qeynos to NK with
no SoW (man, the sacrifices I make for you guys). Waited a few minutes at
the druid rings for a wolf to walk by. Found one, pulled it to the ring. As
soon as I got in the ring, I was attacked by all the druids and then a
Treant joined in.

Not positive what this means, but I DID learn that you were correct at least
mostly :)
