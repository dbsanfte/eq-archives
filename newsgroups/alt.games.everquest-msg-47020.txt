Saw a Dwarf in BB walking around crouched. I watched invis for a bit,
and decided this was truly a newbie. I told them to hit 'd' and they
stood. I buffed them up and went inside to sell. (oddly, I am allied
with dwarves, indiff to druid merchants, it pays to run into Kaladim.)


I sold what I was carrying from Stonebrunt and SK, except a near full
set of banded wicker. I went outside and have that and the FS morning
star I had in the bank for some reason (Screaming mace is gone, so I
can guess why I have it. /sigh) and gave them to the newbie, with the
admonition that beggars are not respected, but someone who truly tries
is often rewarded.

I apparently have a newbie cleric friend now.
