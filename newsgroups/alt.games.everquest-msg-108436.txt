AH HA! SEE?

Actually I do fix some, if it makes sense. If I reply to this post:


"Blah said:

Yeah, cause your mama likes that!

Roberto Duran said:

Hey, is it okay to give and receive spankings?

Me said:

Oh you are nasty!"


It just doesn't make much sense. This is much improved:


"Roberto Duran said:

Blah said:

Me said: 

oh you are nasty!


See? It is much more clear who I am calling nasty. This is where a fix
is warranted. ANY time there is only a few lines of either a fix is
warranted. 

Now, let me give an example of where top posting is GOOD:


"Title of post:  My luclin characters all got nutty with missing
pieces of armor and weird textures displaying as of april 5, WHAT THE
SAM HELL?

Body of post:

Me said:

The problem is that in your eqclient.ini the following line, near the
bottom of the [Defaults] section got changed to TRUE:

LoadVeliousArmorsWithLuclin=FALSE

Velious armors are BROKEN TEXTURES with luclin models (including THE
VAH SHIR, which everyone displays with or WITHOUT luclin models) and
don't display right. Make sure that line is false as I've done.


A poster said:

30,000 lines of text talking about the above problem and how he hates
verant's guts and everyone is Hitler and should die."


The reason why it is okay, in fact its better, to top post in that
case is that everyone else in the thread is likely to include his
39,000 lines of text then post at the bottom. Who is going to wade
through all of that for tha answer? Meanwhile, my very short and to
the point answer (succinct, as it were) Is right there at the top of
the post saying what the problem is and what to do.  Of course in a
clear case like this (because of the title of the post) I could just
elminate his text altogether and only include my answer, pleasing
everyone.
