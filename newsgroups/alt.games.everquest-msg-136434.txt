    This isn't hypothetical for me. I am wearing an item I picked up when
someone did a not-so-secret drop. I also once found a bag with a full suit
of Rubicite, back when a full suit of Rubicite was a big deal.

    In both cases I added the items to my inventory and went about my
business. I've also lost an item when I placed it in a trade container,
logged to the alt it was intended for, and found someone else had found it.
As a GM will tell you, if you drop it you won't be reimbursed - you got rid
of it. Next time, find a friend to do the passing for you.
