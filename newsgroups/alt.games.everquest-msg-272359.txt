I get that. There are "very important class defining differences" that 
"make them all equally good at doing all the same things". Yes I get 
that.

But never to the point where the difference is *important*. Its just 
there, an irrelevant bit of flavour, never something more.

Or god forbid: go around it. In EQ1 if my groups had to disband 
everytime they saw something they couldn't take I'd still be level 20.

Why should every group with a representative of each of the 4 basic 
classes be able to take every single encounter they come accross??
