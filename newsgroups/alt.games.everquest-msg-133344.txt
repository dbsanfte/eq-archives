You seem to be conflating gematria with Kabbalah.
There are a few different facets of the system.
Contrast gematria with notariqon, as one example.

Gershom Scholem is probably the most authoritative
writer on the Kabbalah, ever.

They don't mention Wicca either.

His reverence amongst other Wiccans is immaterial.
I'm saying he is probably the most important
single person in the development of Wicca.

Other Wiccans may like or dislike him, but his
contribution cannot be ignored.

It was a rhetorical question.

Three Wiccans may well give you three different
answers on the history of Wicca, but only one
could be correct.

Did you click on the links contained in the
passage you cited?

If you had, you would have read this;

"There is general agreement that Wicca first
became a mass movement in recent times in England
during the 1950's with the publishing of books by
Gerald Gardner. It has expanded at a furious rate
in North America and Europe." 

This is a matter of history. If you can find
anyone who can document a different history, I'll
be glad to listen.

Quite possible.

In these essays, they all refer to the connection
(indirectly), between the Tetragrammaton and the
pentagram. If you have any further interest, you
might like to check out the (in)famous Eliphas
Levi representation.

So.... it does have some significance to some
Wiccans, at least?

Or would you conclude from the above, that it has
"no significance whatsoever"?

It was a Wiccan friend of mine that suggested the
Robert Cochrane link. I found it interesting too.
