I'm not sure where you find a causal connection.  I rarely swear and
haven't been in a fight since third grade.  What we do know from
linguistics is that speech patterns are ingrained at an early age and
can require substantial effort to overcome.

Oddly, when I was a linguist I found that the most profanity came in
societies where the upper classes had been denigrated and eradicated.
You can't believe how the Czechs swore. There profanity is far more
imaginative, and you'd see it all the social contexts where we would
be most inclined to restrain ourselves.  Part of that was that under
the socialist dogma, everyone had to conform to the dictum of the
controlling class.  Consequently, the most lower class modes of speech
were the dominant ones.

Not too surprisingly, manners were a bit coarse as well.  I was kicked
and pushed in line at McDonalds and rudeness was an art form. One of
the booming businesses these days are good old fashioned etiquette
schools.  Business execs send employees to month long academies to
learn how to be polite, respond to telephone calls and inquiries and
manage confrontation without escalation.

Guess what one of the core skills taught are?
