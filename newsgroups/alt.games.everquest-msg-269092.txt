OK... we all know about the ubiquitous tic in EQ.

But I ran accross an article claiming that weapon swings were also 
governed on a per tic basis. Is this true?

The implications of this are signficant, as there should be fairly 
noticable dps jumps as you cross tic thresholds. (ie from 1 swing per 
tick to 2 swings per tic, etc...)

It also implies that a 50/50 weapon is the same as a 50/55 weapon. (At 
least unhasted), as they will both only ever swing once per tic.

I'd always assumed there was a sub-tic accumulator to carry over the 
remainder to eliminate this tic artifact, and ensure that even small 
delay differences between weapons could be observed.

At any rate, I'm hoping for a quick answer... I could parse this easily 
enough, but I'd prefer not need to :)
