Oddly, you didnt' list your 65 wizard among your many others.

Wizard is not, IMO, the hardest class to play, though it's far from the
easiest. But people who don't wiz quad always have this wrong impression
of it. There have always been big level gaps where there's either
nothing suitable to quad for good xp that won't kill you, or only a few
optimal targets that every wizard on the server is competing for.

And up at the very high levels, quadding, while doable, is insanely
rough. When your prospective victims catch up to you for a moment, they
don't just bruise you up a bit anymore. They crush you into a grease
spot.

Also, in most of the former good quadding zones, Sony has done
everything they can lately to nerf them to make quadding impractical.
(Billions of traps in the Grey, changed spawn patters in ME, half zone
aggro radius for the named in CS, etc.)

But in general, yes.... you're going to have to be on your toes and have
a hell of a lot of perseverence to take a wizard up to the high levels
where he really begins to shine.
