There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs that fall under
Affirmative Action.  Some of these programs, the ones you are bitching
and moaning about, amount to nothing more than racial quotas.  These
are stupid and misguided.  Defining every effort to implement
Affirmative Action in terms of these programs is just the sort of
political bullshit I'm sick and tired of on all sides of this and
other arguments.  Your insistence on doing this is the sort of
intellectually dishonest spin doctoring that makes me despise most
political sorts, and especially the self-righteous sorts on the left
and the right who seem to be hopelessly addicted to it.  You can try
to hijack the (general) debate, but I will not have any part of it.
You want to debate racial quotas, then debate racial quotas (not with
me tho, I refuse to favor them).  You want to debate Affirmative
Action then debate Affirmative Action without the tacit lie of
assuming that it equates to racial quotas.

Speaking of "changing the subject".  You were whining about the
"unfairness" of affirmative action.  I pointed out that your
argument in that vein was far more applicable to the issue of
uneven distribution of wealth than the minor impact of affirmative
action.  And now I ask you, regarding affirmative action, "Why is it,
if someone has a leg up, everyone else gets pissed off?"

Wrong.  Open your mind a tiny little bit (clue:  swallowing some
politico's bullshit unexamined won't help), and perhaps you will
be able to apply a bit of reason to what I said.  Every item you've
tried to claim as a distinguishing argument vs. affirmative action
is equally or more applicable to the "unfairness" of being born
wealthy.  You want to make a convincing argument against one and
not the other you're gonna have to do one helluva lot better.

I did hear what you had to say.  I still can't tell it apart
from the equally bogus arguments I hear from extreme leftists
regarding the distribution of wealth in western society.  Your
arguments are grounded in unspoken assumptions and convenient
half-truths, just like theirs are.
