Yesterday, I was in Eastern Wastes and someone ooc'd that a Fabled 
Ry'Gorr chest piece was rotting. I ran over and looted it and thanked 
the person who had advertised it. It was an upgrade for me.
He said that he didn't ninja loot. I was a bit puzzled by the statement 
but didn't take the time to discuss it with him.
The piece was Bard usable and both of us were playing Bards at the time. 
It is a NO TRADE item.
I thought that when an item was advertised as "up for grabs," the term 
ninja looting did not apply, but maybe I don't understand the term well 
enough.
I looked in our FAQ but didn't find a definition of ninja looting.
Any thoughts?
