I honestly can't remember the last time we did anything but Master
Loot. It's probably been years.... Doing ML really makes sense when
you get a group up, head somewhere for a few hours, sell, cover the
dot cost for clerics and then split the rest. Tradeskill items just
get split between the people that ask for em,  everything else gets
sold before the split. I tend to be ML often since I travel with a lot
of empty slots and am 190 under my encumberance limit and usually I
end up loosing money on the deal because I'll start out with some plat
on me and forget to seperate that before the split but that isn't a
problem with the ML system, just with my bookkeeping <g>. It's
balanced by the fact that I often get junk items that I can't give
away at the end of a dungeon crawl. Things I might put on a bazaar
mule and sell for 50 or 100p. 

 It can get kinda hectic in a group where people are rotating in and
out continously but you just do the best that you can and split what
you have before someone leaves. If in doubt, give the extra to the
cleric, he's probably had to eat peridot costs in some group recently.

If someone cared enough to request Alpha loot in LDoN, I'd just make
him ML! :p

Think of alpha loot as a (relatively) cheap way of deciding who you do
and don't ever want to group with again. There's an old saying "If you
loan a friend $20 and you never see him again, it was probably worth
the $20". ... same goes for people in EQ <g>
