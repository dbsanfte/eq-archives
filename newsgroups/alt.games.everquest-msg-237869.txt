For me I would say:

1)  Bard, because of the constant song twisting.

2)  Enchanter because they are also having to do lots of stuff (mezz,
stun, charm, root, etc., depending on the situation), plus from what I
understand they die a lot (mobs seem to really get mad at the
enchanter for mezzing them for some reason!).

3)  Cleric--some people seem to think clerics just do nothing but
heal/med/rez but sometimes they actually have to sort of "play God",
when a fight goes bad, when they are low mana and can't heal everyone
in the group and have to decide who lives and who dies at the spur of
the moment. (and a cleric can't really AFK too much, they have to pay
attention to everyone's health bars constantly)

I think the selection screen when creating a character says necros and
SKs are "high difficulty" mostly because of KOS issues more than
anything, but Luclin and PoP have made that less of an issue than it
used to be.
