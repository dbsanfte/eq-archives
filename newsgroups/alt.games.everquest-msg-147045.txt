From what info I have found, I am not able to utilize my GeForce4 to it's
full capability due to my cpu being a mere P3-800, I would need to go to a
P3-1000 minimum for that.  However, it is a major step up in performance for
me from the GeForce2 MX400 I had before.  When I bought my new video card, I
bought it with the expectation of migrating it to my next system too, so I
did spring for the extra memory on it.    With the video card you are
running now, you would see a huge improvement even going to a GeForce2 I
believe.  I don't know how much difference 128MB makes vs 64MB on the
GeForce4 with EQ.  I think you are on the right track for squeezing another
year out of your system.
