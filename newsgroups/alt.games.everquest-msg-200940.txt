...as well as too selfish to expect to squeeze on more group into the 
chaos. I mentioned that that particular little corner of the zone supported 
me, but fell way short of being productive for a full group. In other

supported so many more people.

a complete disregard to the fact that I was sitting there in a clear camp. 
Yeah, that's what I was doing, breaking it for them.
