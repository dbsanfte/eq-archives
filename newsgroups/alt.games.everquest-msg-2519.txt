Depends on the situation, and the equipment of the people involved.

With the exception of mages tho...mage pets inflict WAY more damage than
rangers, unless the ranger has his epics (and even then, the epic mage pet
owns him).

Except against heavily MR mobs, a shaman it better for something FAR more
useful than healing: Damage prevention. No need to heal damage that never
happens, yes? In many circumstances, regrowth+ turgurs is just as (if not
more) effective as complete heal. Plus shamans recycle mana, at minimum,
twice as fast as a cleric...three times faster if the shaman has a fungi
tunic.
