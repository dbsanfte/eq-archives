    Coming from "Farghen Oom", I'm not surprised. ;-) It's true - when you
see a delightfully funny name, it usually says a lot about the player.
Subtle references are fun, too - this coming from the player of "Delores
Mulva". (Seinfeld isn't against the PnP, is it?)

    Many of the jerks quit over being nailed in such a personal way -
especially once they hit high enough level. As for figuring out if they ARE
jerks, I'm a bearded dwarf female with the above name - I have my own
built-in jerk detector, thanks.
