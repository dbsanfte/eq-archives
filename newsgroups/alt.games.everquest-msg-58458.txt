Hell no clerics can't solo as easily as a pet class, but if you are choosey
as to what you solo you can lvl just as easily as any other class solo, for
example took cleric to camp Happ at level 42 got to 48 in 8 days easily. But
no way the cleric could have taken on say gornet solo for those same levels.
But then again I watched a couple 46th lvl druids die trying to camp Happ
solo...
