Yes this is just wonderful for raids. Now you can port the competing groups
to Surefall Glade without their consent and have the place all to yourself.

Need the ubermob to spawn? Groupbuff a corpse and crash the zone! (Really.
No shit, not kidding).

Newbie begging? Port their ass to skyfire, no popup confirmation required.

Mage, necro, other pet class annoying you? Groupbuff invisibility and watch
the pets go poof.

I hope the griefers enjoyed it for the five hours or so that it lasted
before the emergency patch.

Targetgroupbuffs were a really good idea. Too bad they didn't think to test
it first.
