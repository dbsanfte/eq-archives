Ahh you are like those 12 - 17 year old females who made Titanic the
box office lie that it was by each going to see it 9 or 10 times. I
thought it was a good film but I never go and see films over and over,
I know what happens. I saw it once and will probably go one more time
to see it in the theater to catch the several times I had to go potty
the first time.

Don't know but it seems to depend on your type of dvd card or
whatever. I did a search for "dvd screen capture" on hotbot which
brought up links to Hypersnap and some posts of people having problems
making such captures.
