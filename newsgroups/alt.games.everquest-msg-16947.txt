Thats just cowardly behaviour. I personaly dont thinkg logging is ever
acceptable to save a little exp loss. Its cheating, plain and simple. You can
whinge and moan about the others in the group not doing their bit but youre the
one who grouped with them. Logging is the equivalent of having a /MOB back off
cos im nearly dead and i dont want to lose experience, command. Sure your luck
will let you down at times, things wont go your way but what fun is a game
where theres no challenge? I hate dying and losing exp and corpse runs but id
rather have this than duck out the back door. Besides, the frustration of dying
can teach you to watch out where youre going and to use a little caution. And
if you log then you will never experience the feeling you get when your bashing
shit out of a Mob, youre both knocking on deaths door, knowing that the next
hit is gonna kill the receiver, and you triumph. Fair and square.
