Hello all,

I have been playing a Cleric lately. He is at lvl 26 and has 3 main buff
spells: Spirit Armor, Bravery, and Symbol.
Name                    AC buff        HP buff
Spirit Armor          +13AC
Bravery                  +9AC          +114HP
Symbol                                       +94HP

Spirit Armor cast time is long (2.25) and uses 75 mana. I usually cast this
only on myself and give only Bravery and Symbol to the tanks due to mana
considerations. The question is, how much of a difference will +13 AC make
in terms of damage taken? Anybody have a website that sheds some light on
damage versus AC?

Thanks,

Da Weasel

*note* information on cast time taken fron eqcastersrealm.com Seems longer
that this to me.
