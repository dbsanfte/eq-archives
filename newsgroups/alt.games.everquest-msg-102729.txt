Charisma's role in affecting success for certain spell lines has always
been a subject of debate among chanters. Recent info from Verant (one of
fan fair panels, I believe ~ I read about it on caster's realm) states
that increasing chr is actually only minimally helpful for enchanters. I
dumped chr gear off my chanter and replaced it with int, hp, and ac once
I read the transcript of that discussion, and I honestly can't tell any
difference in how long charms last or how often mez or charm is
resisted. Granted with clarity and careful management, most chanters
don't run oom all that often; still, it can happen and you might as well
have more mana (or hp or ac) since high chr apparently doesn't do nearly
as much as we all used to suspect.

Druids need all the wis they can get; mana is life and there is no such
thing as too much of it! My main is a 53 druid. Trust me, I don't need
hp or ac; I only get hit once in a blue moon, and then only briefly. You
are correct in that quadding pretty much requires 195 or better wis on
most mobs; otherwise you simply run oom before they drop. Right click
effect items are useful only if the effect is something I actually need
in a pinch; I wear ES vambs (free dot) and the warden symbol of tunare
(free root ~ but it's got wis, mana, ac, chr as well), and occasionally
ES gaunts if I'm going to be killing a bunch of green stuff, but I
switch them for wis gloves for *real* hunting. I wouldn't bother with a
right click item that cast, say, camouflage or a buff of some sort. I
guess if you were going to group a lot, you might need ac and hp (since
groups tend to have a low priority for saving the druid); but I know
very few druids at high levels who actually group often enough to
justify sacrificing the luxury of a larger mana pool.
