I think some people won't see them depending on graphics settings.  When
I've tweaked the client down to lowest texture detail and *no* new PC
models - about as bare bones as you can get - it rips through that loading
screen so fast you really don't see any of those.  Now, once I crank
everything up and it takes a bit to load, I can see a good chunk of them
while waiting.
