Nice patch, but I have one request. 

All the extra chat commands are great, and the channels are super. But
what I would love to see added is a /morons list. Works exactly like
the /friends list, but would store the names of the persistantly
unpleasant players one runs across. An added feature is that it could
possibly automatically include their alts as well.

Other choices could be:
/pinheads
/cretins
/beggars
/ninjalooters
/killstealers
/arrogantdruids
/733+d00dz
/ubertwinks
/playersthatdontlistentotheenchanterandwipeouttheentirepartyandhalfthezone
/tolkeincharacternames
/sowplz
/campers
/FF <#> 
/foreigners
/americans
/peoplewhosayLOL
/me
/idiotswhowritestupidUSENETposts
/stopmeplease

Ack, enough. Sorry to waste your time. Standard disclaimer is in
effect, all posts are tongue-in-cheek, and not meant to offend. Well,
unless it is. :-)

Cheers
