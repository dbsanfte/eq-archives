Yeah, I used to head to orc hill, and oasis, and the like, and buff/sow/heal
people, and usually offered free ports.  Well, not anymore.  I've been
trying off and on to pick up a port for two days with my Paladin.  Offered
20pp for port to WC, and all I got was "LosersThatAskMyDruidForBuffs: Take
the boat like everyone else"

Gets funny when I log my Druid back in, and the same guys that were telling
off my Paladin ask Mr. Druid for help and buffs.

Sheesh...the d00d speak really irritates me, but I still find it hard to say
to no to the polite people..."May I trouble you for the Spirit of the Wolf
kind sir?"  Those guys usually get whatever buffs I can offer.
