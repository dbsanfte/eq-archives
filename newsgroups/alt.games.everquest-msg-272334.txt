I did not say that was all I could solo in that time frame, I'll time it 
next time, but I am fairly certain I can solo more than that in that time 
frame.  I am uncertain how many solo light blues it would take to level 
in EQ1 at that level, if you exclude the ludicrous xp zones that came 
later.  I think that as a shaman in both games, I can solo at these 
levels at about the same advancement rate.  Downtime is a lot higher in 
EQ1 than EQ2, mobs probably give a bit less xp for equivalent effort, 
resulting in a similar advancement rate.
