Lets see where should I start...top posting or obvious stupidity? 
Lets take a vote, all in favor of taking this clown to the cleaners
for top posting raise your hands....1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 3000....For being
a moron with so little imagination that he needs written directions to
just find a inkling of a clue?..1 2 3 4 5 6...3000...damn. 

Ah I see we have a tie...ah well guess you got lucky. Oh wait every
one voted twice, freakin cheaters bet ya run showeq too.
