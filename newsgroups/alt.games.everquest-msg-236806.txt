Highly over rated. I'm running around in a presumably silk dress and I
hardly ever die.  Maybe you should get a robe. = )

Or possibly better yet you should just get everything in this magelo
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=113827

Or maybe just maybe, you could post your magelo and a few people might offer
some constructive criticism.

Or try looking around the Paladin class site
http://pub148.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath
Look at other paladin's magelos.  See what is droppable and try and price it
in the bazaar, or use the bazaar feature to search for items for paladins
with the stats you are trying to raise (AC/HP/Sta).

Best of luck,
