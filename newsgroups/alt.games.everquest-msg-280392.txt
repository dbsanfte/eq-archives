It depends.  The /pet focus command only works if you have the AA 
ability.  Barring that, try making up a hotkey:

/pet backoff
/pet attack %T

This hotkey will tell your pet to back off the current mob, and attack 
the mob you are targetting.

Mind you, prior to getting /pet focus, your pet will make decisions as to 
which mob to attack based on things I am not quite certain of.
