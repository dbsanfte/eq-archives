: Fair enough... It's just that I think that it wouldn't be an altogether
: bad thing to start opening up old keyed content (Sebilis, HS, VP, VT,
: what-have-you) as new expansions come out. This way those players at the
: Uber end of the bell curve who can get keys enjoy all the content
: undisturbed by the hoi-polloi for a year or so, and afterwards players
: who solo or are members of small, innefectual guilds can also have a
: shot at some nice loot.

: In fact, if this was the default policy, then *more* new dungeons could
: be keyed, thus preserving even more content for Uber players early on.

Or just make the keys easier to get.  Still keyed, just easier.  You would
still need to work to get the nice drops so there would not be too much of a
revolt.
