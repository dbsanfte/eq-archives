Ahhh. I get it. Well, I was wrong. It was a jab based on his example
of a little old lady in the checkout line. I do get overly miffed when
people use foul words for no good reason. It gives me an impression of
a teenager giggling at the keyboard. He used a few in the previous
message, and I made the stock boy crack as a comeback instead of using
something vulgar, but rightfully I should have ignored his words and
responded with facts. Anyway,  good luck once they do get servers up
