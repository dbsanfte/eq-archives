Someone posted this to the Magicians tower about the flagging
changes on test:

"It appears the no flag things are live, with a twist. Level limits in tier 
2 of 55 and tier 3 of 63 (Not positive on this one) also, tactics will 
still need a flag. 

Im also hearing about 2 additional bank slots, that are account wide. So 
say you put a fire beetle eye with once character and log on another and go 
to the bank, it will be in the new slot, I cant confirm this, but when i 
can ill bring it here. 

Also, an interesting patch message

------------------------- 


/testbuff - We are adding a new command for use only on the Test server. 
/testbuff will raise the level of your character to 25 if it was below 
level 25. It will also provide the character with all appropriate spells as 
well as a balanced set of items for their class. This will help testers who 
want to try out a problem with characters of different classes or who are 
just starting out on the Test server. 


Spell Descriptions - We are adding a much more informative spell 
description window to Test today. All of the spell description should be 
available except for Druid and Beastlord spells, which we will add soon. We 
will also be adding descriptions for spells available from items in a 
little while. Please make sure that the spell descriptions appear for all 
spells but those mentioned above, and please let us know if you have any 
suggestions or comments about the descriptions.
