My first two characters were Melee, Monk then Warrior. The Monk I gave up
on, having wasted points for important skills later on and at the low levels
(only got as far 20th) was inferior to the Warrior (these are totally
untwinked, eg at 9th level I was proud to have a FS weapon and one in the
bank I got free from a passing player) These characters were played the hard
way but I didn't find it difficult (lost the monks corpse a few times until
4th) to the point that I ever wanted to quit them or the game.

Nowadays I made a new monk, it took me 4hrs to get to 11th, he wears Wu's
armour and sporallie gloves (9% haste) and has a fighting baton in his off
hand...at 11th level his 1hb is 24 and H2H 29! That is under half what it
should be, It took me 4hrs to get a cleric to 5th with 50th level Druid
buffs before these changes. I wonder how many true newbies are finding that
they are levelling way to fast for their skills.

On the plus side, there are a lot of newbie quests with nice rewards, from
what I have seen these seem to be around the new class/race combos (halfling
ranger/druid armour) but the rewards actually look worth it for the levels
(check out Moss Toe and Thorn Mail items on Allakhazam's) there is also
items for Dark Elf Clerics but NPC is broken :ï¿½( and very likely other race
class combo's that haven't been found/reported to Allakhazams yet. It is
about time newbies got the chance to get some equipment that is of some use
to them.
