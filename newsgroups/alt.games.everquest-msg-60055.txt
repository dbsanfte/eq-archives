I was at the commons tunnel last night trading when a high lvl mage who was
quitting the game started telling riddles.  If you guessed the riddle in the
form of a question he would give you an item.  The last item he had was an
ornate rune shield.  I beat the other 200 people who were guessing to the
punch and he gave me the shield.  A few trades later I've got 20K worth of
stuff and am giving up the trading business to go fight again.  Up until
this point 4k was about all I could muster.

Thank you Bahkoo on the 7th Hammer server!


On a side note in trade I got two spells.  Lvl 60 Mage "Ageis of Ro" and lv
59 mage "Manastorm".  A guy told me I could get 1k per.  I've never played a
caster and have no clue what these spells are worth.  Does 1k sound in the
ballpark?
