The guilds I'm associated with have dropped from >100 members on at 
prime time to less than 50 in the last week.  Our last raid day brought 
in a grand total of 10 people... usually we have 60 or so show up.

Now, part of it is definitely the holidays ... we always see a reduction 
in numbers the couple of weeks before Thanksgiving, but not anywhere 
near what we're seeing now.  When EQ2 went live it was very noticeable. 
  When WoW open beta started, the guild started feeling like a ghost town.
