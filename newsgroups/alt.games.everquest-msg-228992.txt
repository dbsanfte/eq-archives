    Bwahahahahaha! See, some people understand how SOE thinks. Sadly, I'm
one of those people. Adding a new data field that applies only to pets would
never have even come up in the discussions, as that takes resources and a
rework of the database. Plus, if they ever do something like that, it's easy
to see what bugs they'll create. You just watch - charmed pets will become
Reclaimable, and Suspended pets will return some amount of mana wildly
different than the actual summon cost.

    And as an EQ player, you know all about dumb ass, poorly thought out
kludges. But not as much as me, haha! ;-)
