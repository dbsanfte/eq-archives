If you play anything close to intellegently you can have any of the
tradeskill kits by the end of 2nd level, 3rd at the latest.  And I
would say first but you move though the first 2 levels so fast.

Non-twinked, refusing all handouts, my WE druid had 60pp in the bank
before 5th level spells became available and I just got 8th the other
day and have over 200pp in the bank.  That is turning down everything
from armor to money to forest loops and other expensive stuff I
shouldnt have at my level.

So dont whine about how low level means no money.  Only if you are
missing a few brain cells OR are a brand new player.  Even if a new
player you should be able to deduct that "Hey, the merchant gives me
around 1s for Batwings or Bone Chips which means they would be 2g for
a stack of them....players are often buying them for 1pp to 5pp and
sometimes even MORE per stack.....hmmmmm maybe I should quit selling
them to the merchant and save them for players?"
