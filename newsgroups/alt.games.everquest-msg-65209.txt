OK, looks like we all get the runaround to get registered?

Note to trainer, he gives you note to registrar(near south gate), she
gives you note
to tax collector (in bank) and also asks you to get slate from Mingar
(near north gate) and return to her.  Then you take something to King,
return to her, take letter and slate to trainer.

Many of the quests in town apparantly then require you to give slate to
NPC to get it returned and get your slate back.  Lose that slate and you
are screwed, since you'll have no guild note to start over with.  I
imagine there is some way to MQ this though with a second new character.

BL get a quest involving some threads; you get a sewing kit and a
pattern.  Kill Xatra Larvae to get silks, combine two to get a thread,
two threads to get a bandage, three bandages and the pattern to get a
handwrap, which apparantly will get you your first weapons... or not.
I"ve yet to successfully combine that final step, which represents at
least 12 silks... sucks to be me.  Tailoring 12, none of the steps
trivial yet.

ALchemist shop guild Spiritist Ragnar takes the no drop no rent scorpion
glands and gives padded cloth armor, cash, and exp.  They drop off whip
scorpions.

Hmm, a Broker something (sells nothing but a wedding band) took my slate
and returned it with a bag to put four hopper hides in and return to him
for leather... no idea what quality he needs or how good the leather is.

Another NPC took my slate and kept it, so I'm screwed unless a GM
answers my petition.

One of the guys near the cages asked for either 4 grimling skeleton toes
or fingers, but not a mix.

Someone insisted that the grimling rib cages are for a shield quest.

Someone said that the Xatra Bile is for a shaman guild quest.

Someone was looking for Grimling Femurs, said 4 would get him a nice
sword.

Thats all I'm aware of so far.
