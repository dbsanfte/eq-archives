To get to the east wing, you need to fight through the entire south wing.
That is, if you have a rogue.  If  you don't, then you need to fight through
the North, West and South wings first. : P  And probably camp the bosses if
the placeholders are up.

There are several blind dropoffs and a one way door where you should not be
able to get singles.   It's expected that you fight those fights 4 on 1.
(Or really, four on six.)

At other places in south and east, it's possible to get singles at 60, but
unlikely.  3 or 4 mobs packed in a small room.  Sometimes you can pull one
out, sometimes you get the whole lot.
