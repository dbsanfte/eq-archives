Yep, and I had enough for two full sets bar the spotted yellow, which i
eventually got for 50s. On the plus side my harvesting etc skills are going
up. On the down side i've started all these fragment/shard quests that
occupy heaps of journal space for very green quests. I just hope that they
haven't done what they do with gambling, and made the distribution uneven,
so that it looks like you are always just about to win if you keep investing
money/time into a rigged game...

I was trying to sell / trade off the 'flies as i went  but noone had seen
the particular butterfly. It just seems to me that they have decided one
member of each set will be incredibly rare, and I hope I'm wrong about that.
On te other hand, i think i got 30 % of a level out of the butterfly ring.
