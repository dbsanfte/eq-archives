I don�t want to rant here, but have you ever thought about a separate 
firewall. I use one which is integrated into my DSL Modem / Router and 
I�m quite happy with the status quo. Ok it doesn�t have a content 
filtering but a simple port filter with an explicit close all until you 
open explicetly policy und a routing to internal VPN adresses for special 
services does its job pretty well. Ok this is not something for an 
average user, nor for the pro, but I think it is a quite ok solution for 
security/performance.
