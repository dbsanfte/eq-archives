    After all, when people zone in after you've cast an illusion, what do
you want them to see: a gnome-sized troll, or a high elf-sized gnome? I know
which one makes ME turn and run screaming. "Aaaaaiiiieeee, giant gnomes!!!!"
So gnomes are clearly the best enchanters. And they fit in the ranged slot
when not mezzing stuff.
