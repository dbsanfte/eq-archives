Your the one equating it. Not me. Roleplaying has little to nothing to 
do with wanting to be poor and suffering, per se.

Thats my point with Mario... Skipping the shortcuts in Super Mario 
Brothers to finish the 'long way' isn't "roleplaying"... it just adds to 
the challenge.

In a game like EQ you cannot choose who plays on your sever. You can 
however limit who you interact with.

Can you really not comprehend playing Doom with just a pistol?? Its not 
necessarily 'roleplaying' its simply redefining the rules of the game to 
heighten ones own enjoyment. You can't physically disable all the 
weapons lying around, but you can choose not to use them. Do you really 
not understand that people would want to do this??

Roleplaying by definition, means playing a role. It has little to 
nothing to do with the way the world works. In the case of EQ there is 
only one dominant server-culture, a fast-easy-leveling-twinking culture.

Roleplayers (and anyone else) may wish to revise the rules the game to 
avoid this culture, and derive greater enjoyment from it... but without 
access to a private server, with player invitation priviledges to seek 
like-minded players the best they can do is simply ignore the parts of 
the game they aren't interested in.

A roleplayer may indeed play 'characters' bound by an 'oath of poverty'.

But that's not the point, and doesn't represent the typical roleplayer 
in EQ. In EQ rpers (and many non-rpers) typically simply seek to avoid 
interacting with the high level players to change the effective 
parameters of the game; they do not seek to avoid getting rich. They 
simply want to get rich in a more difficult, more challenging way than 
is 'strictly necessary'.

For the roleplayer, this is not a case of mercenaries refusing a 
commission. This is a case of the players deciding to play a game of EQ 
where there are no higher level players, and then creating a 'character' 
who is as money hungry ruthless mercenaries as they can be. To the 
player, this means the bazaar doesn't exist, higher level powerlevelling 
buffs don't exist, twinked items don't exist etc. The players 
'character' isn't refusing these items and buffs, the player himself has 
editted them out of the game, his character would be more than happy to 
take them if he could... but for him they don't exist.  That is 
"roleplaying'.

For another group of players, non-roleplayers, they simply arbitrarily 
choose to ignore hilevel buffs, or the bazaar, or twinked items, or 
anything they didn't personally solo, or any other combination of 
arbitrarily constructed self-imposed restrictions to increase the 
difficulty of the game.

This is no different than players who avoid using the super weapons in 
doom, avoid the shortcuts in mario, or who play diablo2 hardcore 
(permadeath), and has nothing to do with roleplaying at all.

I guess it would depend on what the bunnies have to say.
