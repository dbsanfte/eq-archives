Damn the floyd!  but look at this.

http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html

" The asymmetric nature of this gravitational interaction is also
responsible for the fact that the Moon rotates synchronously, i.e. it
is locked in phase with its orbit so that the same side is always
facing toward the Earth."


The same size is always facing the earth.
Ah, this explains more about "the dark side" (besides pink floyd ;) )
Since the same side is facing the earth, the other side came to be
known as "the dark side." So its not just Floyd ;) Though you guys are
right about the light. Dark  was used as "uknown." 

" (Note: there is no "dark side" of the Moon; all parts of the Moon
get sunlight half the time (except for a few deep craters near the
poles). Some uses of the term "dark side" in the past may have
referred to the far side as "dark" in the sense of "unknown" (eg
"darkest Africa") but even that meaning is no longer valid today!) "


Hence my confusion about the moon revolving, I just assumed it did not
since we always see the same side but that is explained in the first
quote above. Crazy!

There, I learned more than I ever knew about the moon in 35 seconds. I
love the net!
