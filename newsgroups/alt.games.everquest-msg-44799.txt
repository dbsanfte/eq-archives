A character that is a nice, kind female that routinely tells others "Go fuck
yourself, I was camping this spot, etc"...

Sorry, you just don't strike me as the roleplaying type.  And playing a female
doesn't automaticly give you a free pass. ;)

You commented on thier roleplaying ability.  If you have no concern over it at
all, why the comment?

What does this statement have to do with anything?   Since when is a druid,
whether Tunarean or Karanan one, going in and scouting for a raid "acting like
a jackass" and in what way do they impose on you?

I enjoy very little, thank you for your concern.  Of the three raids there, I
only went on one of them, and don't intend to go back.   The raid was fun (and
actually the assaults by the PoG's were the most fun part) but the raid was
way too long.and the armor drop rate was worse than awful.
