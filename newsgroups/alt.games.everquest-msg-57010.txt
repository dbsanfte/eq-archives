Great little idea.  I think this will be the first time, the first thing
that will actually entice me to play on a PvP server.

So not to blow your cover, I assume.  However, anyone that has been in a
zone for any fair length of time knows the pathing of all the mobs and one
roaming off of such paths will probably get quickly noticed.

That's fine. I view this as a great way to add to the enjoyment of the game
for other players.  Though I'm sure the jerk players will probably spoil
this all for us.

What's to prevent you from just standing there and letting your friends kill
you for easy XP?

*laugh*  Well, I guess then there's going to be some EQ accounts that will
never log off.

Yeah, that would scare too many PCs.  *evil laugh*

Out of all the changes, this is the only one I see something wrong with.
You should be able to loot and equip your MPC.  It should just be that when
you die, your MPC loses all items except those they started off with ...
even if you destroyed the equipment to make room for other loot.  And I'd
prevent the monster from being able to drop any item either.  Either keep it
or destroy it.

That's too bad.  I think a great idea to introduce this on regular servers.

I think the "only" thing you'd have to do is prevent player-controlled MPC
from attacking anything that is above green to them.
