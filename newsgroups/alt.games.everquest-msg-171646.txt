An argument broke out the last time I played my Cleric in Merus Seru.  1/2 the
group wanted me to run back to Nexus and get a KEI.  The other half, including
the group leader, thought it was lame.  (Not to mention at level 28 my cleric
doesn't really have a ton of money to spend on a KEI.)  I finally did run back
to get one.  Couldn't find anyone casting it at 2 PM CST.  Was so fed up with
the group I just logged out.
On the other hand my 52 ranger can actually solo ry'gorr elites with a KEI on,
and she can afford it!  They are dark blue to me at this level and without KEI
I don't even THINK about doing one without full mana, all buffs on and health
at full.  
KEI hasn't ruined the game but it has surely changed it.
