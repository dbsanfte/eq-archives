Unfortunately this is an open public forum and you can post 'almost'
anything you want, bad language included.

Profanity these days is almost a form of punctuation. No one pays
attention to you unless you swear sometimes.

Quick story: My sister is a very religious person and I personally
have never heard her swear before. But I heard that she did just that
when having her 6th child. My sister having had 5 previous children
was an old hand at having them and knew exactly when to go to
the hospital and knew exactly how long it took her to deliver, which is
very fast. Seems some nurse was poo-pooing her and saying she could
not possibly be ready to have the child as she had only just arrived at
the hospital. After several repeated attempts to get the nurse to listen
to her and waiting much too long my sister finally said "Listen bitch
go and get that fucking doctor because I am having this baby right
fucking now!" The doctor was summoned and Baby was promptly delivered.


But like any good thing its sometimes used too much and it loses its impact.
