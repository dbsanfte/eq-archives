Ummm, we'll, I'm a bard, and I have this theory about sense trap not 
working correctly for bards.  He was an ogre, 'nough said.  Actually, in 
my case it was caused by going to 3rd person view to be able to keep 3 
mobs mezzed and still beat on whatever the MA was killing.  I was sort of 
chatting in between too.  I've certainly figured out a very nifty way for 
a bard and healer to do very well there.  While I fell into the pit I was 
able to pretty much kill one mob and have the 2nd one ready to be killed 
by the time the rest of the group dropped down.  I'm very seriously 
considering doing this with a druid partner as a hidden exp spot.

It's a well-designed dungeon that really forces you to keep moving.  I 
guess you could camp in one spot there, but it's just so much more fun to 
run through killing as you go.

Yeah, but I've pretty much given up on good loot on exp hunts.  If 
something drops, that's nifty, but nothing worth getting excited about.  
Of course once that damn erudite illusion mask drops I'll lose all 
semblance of detachment and get all excited again.  I fully expect to have 
my kitty illusion first, and probably my peck illusion if I'm not careful.
