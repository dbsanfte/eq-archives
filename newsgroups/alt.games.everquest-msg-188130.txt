I wondered the same thing.. got bored and just killed teh beggar for fun...
then went on to other things... the badge quest looked like a fun thing to
complete while i was upping my Qey faction for my soulfire quest.
In the end i basically gave up and continued turning in bonechips and such
till my faction raised enuf...
pretty sure that none of this helps ya much but I just needed to ramble on a
bit..
GL to ya.
