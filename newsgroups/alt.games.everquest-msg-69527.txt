Not to nitpick - but a greater lightstone can be grabbed from a wisp around
level 12, and this is plenty of light, especially with the recent gamma
corrections patched in for nightblind races.  A foreman's skullcap can be
bougt on my server nowadays for 100-200pp and this is also a greater
lightsource.  Can't argue with the corpse runs though, ick.
