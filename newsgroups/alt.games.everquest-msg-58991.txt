I'll confess, of the three or four different news readers I've used over
the years, I haven't used Outlook Depressed, simply because of my
loathing for all things Microcrap. I may have been, once again, jumping
to assumptions in thinking that old Bill would have included a feature
in his newsreader the same as that found in the others I've used.
Perhaps it's not there. I'm certainly not going to install it just to
find out. If the option is available, then I retract my original
statement and apologize to all Microcrap newsreader top posting users.
You are *not* stupid. Just lazy. he he.
  In Netscape, for instance, it's under Edit - Preferences - Mail &
Newsgroups - Messages, and offers you a choice of "Automatically quote
the original text, then..." and one of the choices is "start my text at
the end of the quoted text."
  That may help locate it if a similar option is incorporated into
Outlook Depressed.
