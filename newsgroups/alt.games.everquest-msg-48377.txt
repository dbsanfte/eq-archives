Your basis for this comment is...? Can you name me any quest you've
done that created a meaningful change in the state of the world? And
perhaps even do it without resorting to pointless personal attacks?

Friend, you apparently have an axe to grind and have mistaken me for
the grindstone. I'm going bite back my initial response to this little
outburst and try and correct your misapprehension.

I do quests all the time. I lag behind my guildmates and even family
members who have half the "played time" that I do because I spend more
time exploring the corners of Norrath and doing quests than I do
fighting stuff and leveling up. Have YOU got a brazen brass killij?
Have YOU rescued Brother Hale from the gnolls? Have YOU delivered the
little Kejeken girl's stolen dice bag safely back to her? Do YOU have
your Investigator's Badge? Have YOU even visited Kerra Ridge, let
alone traveled around the world to get the parts for the sacred Bone
Talisman? Have you traveled the breadth of Antonica to collect the
zombie flesh needed by a halfling cleric in order to continue his good
work? Please don't presume to lecture me about risk-taking or hitting
on toons when you don't know anything at all about my playstyle.

75% of the available quests are done for flavor and nothing more. When
you finally want to get your skills up and earn real money, the only
choice is to go out and kill stuff. Period. That's how Verant designed
it.

The coldain ring quests (#10 specifically) and the Investigator Badge
series are the closest thing I've found to quests that amount to
anything in a roleplay or a self-advancement sense. They all still
involve killing stuff, of course, but at least I know WHY I'm killing
that stuff.

Like I said, if you can tell me the way to get ahead in the game
without spending hours decimating stuff, I'm all ears. Just try not to
assume anything about me while you're doing it.
