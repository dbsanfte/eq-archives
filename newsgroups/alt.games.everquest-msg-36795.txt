Why is that being an asshole?  I have ran through several zones to rez
someone who hadn't stated an amount and got 20 gold, which sorry is not
worth my time  unless I know you then I'm doing it for free anyway.  Why is
this any different than the druid/wizard asking for payment before they port
you?  The exception of course is when they are several zones away and the
corpse is right in front of you. I always reply to direct tells when it's
not out of my way I do it for free if I'm doing something I say sorry I
can't help you.
