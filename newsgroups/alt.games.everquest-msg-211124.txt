Mage chain-research is one royal pain in the a**.
I've skilled up my research with practice points. Save enough cash and at
the level train as far as you can.
If you don't have enough cash just use the vendor pet till you do. I always
made the spells with maxed research for my level and only got 2 or 3 fails
ever.

All the words and other stuff drops from mobs around that level, which
usually means you need to kill white/yellow/red mobs. This is hard to solo
but can be done well in groups. LOIO is a good spot for 20-24-29 research
drops and I sometimes farm there for friend's alts (2 weeks ago I farmed the
sarnak fort for an hour or two for some rare lvl 20 necro page).

A lot of the researched pets are now also available in Katta Castellum and I
heard some in PoK.

As for me around those levels. I actually exped on the gargoyles in OOT for
a couple of levels (17-20 or so). The gargs drop on average 1 eye per 2 mobs
and those sell for 8pp a piece. I went ahead and bought several copies of
the petspells there before I moved my bind to another zone. While I hunted
there I offered 10pp for the different toes for the focus quests which drop
off Gornit.
It helps if you read some info for future reference on places like
magecompendium :).
