I loved the new UI, but went back to the old one because of a problem
I had with my pets.  I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar
issue.  My character is a level 9 magician on the Cazic-Thule server.

Twice my water pet "disappeared" in a strange way.  The first time I
clicked on a bear and used the pet window to issue the pet attack
command.  My pet said, "Attacking bear" but nothing was happening -
the bear was just ambling along.  My pet's hp meter and the bear's hp
meter weren't going down - nothing was happening.  I looked around to
see if there was another bear my pet was attacking, but nothing.  I
targeted the bear I wanted several times and clicked the pet attack
with the same results.  I issued a pet back off and a pet follow me
command but I couldn't see my pet.  I went from view to view and still
no pet.  I ran around for awhile and when I targeted my next creature,
voila, my pet was back.  During my next session I ran into the same
thing when I targeted a giant spider.  The pet said it was attacking,
but was nowhere to be found, there was no activity on the pet's or the
spider's hp meter, and I couldn't see my pet anywhere.  I tried to
summon a new pet, but got the "one pet at a time" message.  I told
that pet to go away and summoned a new one, which was visible.

Since I switched back to the old UI, I haven't had the problem.  I'm
fairly new to EQ and have been using pets for a week or so but have
only had the problem under the new UI.  Has anyone else had pet
difficulties?
