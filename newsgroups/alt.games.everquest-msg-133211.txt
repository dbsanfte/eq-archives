}Well, that *IS* strange because Lesa thought you were attributing the

I see no support for that statement.  If she chose to respond to it too, 
more power to her, but that doesn't mean she thought it was attributed to 
her, just that she thought of something interesting to say.  

Wouldn't you agree??

}See what I mean about being ambigious???

No, but you are -very- ambiguous, no question.

}You are either incapable of speaking plainly and w/o PC rhetoric or
}else you are (intentionally??) being obtuse and ambigious so as to
}cover your bases when you are proved wrong (IE "Well, I really meant
}that...." )

It was clear as daylight, bro.  Lump it and move on.
