As a low level characters I run into farmers in most zones I visit. It's 
a pain if they are after the NPC your after.
As most have a good old fashioned I'm better than you so it's mine 
attitude. Even if you were there first.

While not quite the same but just as irritating.

Watching a warmonger in Hollowshade wander off with the entire Grimling 
village in tow I was hunting in, then zap them with one spell. Finally 
adding insult to injury by destroying all No Drops they didn't want. 
After I politely ask if I could loot any leftovers.

So if they are tailoring experience to the monster and who killed it. 
Why not the loot

Each monster has a loot table that drops different loot for different 
groups of level.

So if a group of 6 level 5's take out a level 15 monster they get for 
their level a chance of Very Good loot and trade skill items

While those from 10 to 20 that take it out get quest items, good drops 
and trade skill drops.

While those 20 to say 30 get some quest items they need and trade skill 
items

While 40 to 50 get trade skill only

50 plus (Go and hunt elsewhere you monster stealing bunch of thieves)

Okay it so it would lead to a bug storm. Plus more high level characters 
super charging low level farms.

But if may just make people spread out more and encourage higher level 
people to buy items from lower level characters.

Oh! and while in a spitting venom mood.

I wish they would add an Ignore an entire guild ability or at least a 
one that would zap them all where it hurts literally. I'm glad I'm not 
in a guild as most I've run into seem to look on lower level characters 
as vermin lower than the NPC's.

There now I feel better.
