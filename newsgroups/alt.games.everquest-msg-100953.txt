>Crying like a baby.. 

Yes, you are

>get a life...

Good advice, you should take it.

>If the game increased by that much , how much server down time have you lost to it?

Total downtime compared to the improvments made is trivial. I am very
happy with all of the improvements made over the last 3 years. 

>How many hours were you out and reimbursed for during bad patches.. 

None, and I don't expect to be "reimbursed" for downtime either. EQ is
a game that is constantly evolving. Downtime is part of the process.

>how much hardware upgrade costs did you invest in.. how much were your expansion packs.. well then.. shut up!

I upgrade twice a year. I'm a gamer. Computer gaming is an expensive
hobby. If you can't afford to keep up, get an PS2 or X-Box.

>It has cost players more money to play each and every upgrade... not just the $3 a
>month.. but as usual most here only think its about $3 a month.. 

It only costs the players money if they want to spend it. EQ is a
game. You can choose not to play. If it's not worth upgrading or
paying 3$ more a month to you, then don't. Crying and bitching on
usenet about it is a waste of time.

> everyone who thinks $3 isn't anything, send it all to me every month
>and I will give you what sony has in return for the additional money..NOTHING

You really are delusional aren't you? EQ is a game, and I enjoy
playing it 20-30 hours a week. At 9.89 or 12.95 a month it is a
fantastic value. I have hundreds of hours invested in my characters
and I have made many good friends over the last 2 and a half years.
That is not "NOTHING". What will you give me for $3 dollars a month? I
think you should pay me $3 for having to read through your flawed
logic.

>So for those of you whom think $3 per month isn't crap..
>figure what a little over 12 million a year is going to get us from sony??

More expansions....More improvements....More EQ....Sounds like a good
deal to me.

>NOTHING!!!!!! 

I don't think that word means what you think it means.

>So as we ponder the petty amount of $3 per month per player..
>why not think of it as $12 million plus pulled from the players pockets to
>line Sony's cash accounts... but guess that's just my way of thinking....

Well I don't think you are doing much "thinking" at all. So what if
Sony gets rich off of EQ. They can line their pockets and accounts all
they want. As long as EQ is makes a profit Sony will keep the servers
up and running, and the programmers making improvements. EQ isn't a
charity. What's your damage?

The only thing that matters is whether or not you or I think the
monthly fee for EQ is worth it. 

I think EQ is a great value at 9.89 or 12.95 a month. If you
don't.....quit. It is as simple as that.
