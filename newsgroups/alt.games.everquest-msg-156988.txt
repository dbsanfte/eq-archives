Lot's of quests do that.  But questing experience will never be like hunting
experience (much to my chagrin).  Check out Allakhazam's and look up quests
by zones.  Takes some bit of reading, but not an overly horrible amount.  I
personally love quests.  Before  I go to a zone that I might not be
extremely familiar with, I print up a list of some of the quests.  I won't
go into my little personal database, but suffice it to say, there are plenty
of quests available, that a majority of the people don't even bother with,
where you can get a bit of experience and some decent money.  For the
record, at 27, I still go experience that I noticed by turning in Kobold
molars, not to mention the money and occassional items to help pay for
spells.
