Freeport is a good place to be, because there's a 
magician/enchanter/wizard guild there.    Get yourself to West Freeport, 
find the guild.  There's a short old guy at the entrance, and a 
teleporting gem beside him.  Step on the gem, and the very first chick 
you see in front of you sells malachite.
