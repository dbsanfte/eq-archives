[Insert normal "fucking top posters" comment here]

That group should be *more* than ok. We were in there with (get this) 51
Warrior, 52 Rogue, 50 cleric, 49 Druid, 47 Druid.

We did ok. Of course, as Arolpin points out, having an evaccer is a very
nice thing in deeper. We had to evac twice last night. The adds can get
intense, and the respawn time is quite short. Plus, you run into enough
traps early on that will just keep spawning mobs as often as you open
the door, apparently. (Who was looking for post 50 xp farminging again?
Oh, have I got a room for YOU! heh heh.)
