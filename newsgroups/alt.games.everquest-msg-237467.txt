Installed a soundcard Thursday, it turned from 10 minutes (pop the case, put
it in, install driver) to 9  hours
pop case
install card
close case
computer won't power on.
Open case
pull card
computer won't power on
spend 45 minutes diagnosing what turns out to be a dead power supply... I
never actually turned the thing on before starting. Normally if it won't
power on that would be first thing I check. Customer later tells me he
hasn't been able to power it on for 2 months... but he wants a new sound
card installed. right.
Install card
Install drivers.
Windows protection error, system halted on reboot
Windows protection error, system halted on bootup to safe mode
2 min to weep in corner.
Pull card, WPESH
We're now at 1 hour or so.
~5 hours of beating windows ME with big stick.
~1 hour to run medium depth surface scan of drive. Hard drive has bad
physical sectors all over, but nothing listed in scandisk. Bad sectored
files include the swap file and registry. <sigh>
~2 hours to replace drive, install windows, patch windows, dig up and
install drives for esoteric hardware, and salvage as much data as possible
off failing hard drive.
