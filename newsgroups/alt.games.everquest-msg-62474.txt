Each application in ZoneAlarm has the option of being set up to
"Identify program by full path only." This keeps ZoneAlarm from
popping up every time EverQuest is patched.

Check out SecureKeys Desktop, which blocks any number of keystroke
combos, including the Windows key from firing.

I can't think of a single DirectX game that allows alt-tabbing.
Windowing means at least one InvalidateRect() call and one WM_REDRAW
message for every frame and, at 30 fps, this is a significant
overhead. Allowing alt-tabbing out of a full-screen application means
either constantly resetting the video mode using INT 16h (causing
screen flicker) or constantly querying the video mode, causing
significant slowdown in the message loop. None of the commercially
successful engines do this.

I don't know if Verant has said anything about packet sniffers.
Setting one up would still be trivial, particularly with a dedicated
firewall or even running in the background on the same machine and
giving audio cues (which EverQuest does not block.)  I was being glib
when I brought them up.

If you think that Verant goes out of its way to create "massive
downtime," "link deaths," and "Make Ed Jensen's computer crash,"
you're not the sort of software developer I'd want on my team. Blaming
the tools is rarely a sign of overwhelming confidence.
