No.  Seems StanMann likes to fancy himself the hacker of a.g.e, but that's a
whole other thread....anyway he's just using some common sense and examining
your headers.  Kind of sick actually, how he puts in that personal stuff in
a reply - anyway, here's what he's done to 'find you out' LOL

Message-ID: <3bd7ff5c.2580946@news.mtgmry1.md.home.com>

Even in silly Outlook Express newsreader, I only need look at your msg
properties to discover this line - tells me quite a bit actually.  Being on
the @home service myself, the 'home.com' on the end tells me you also
subuscribe to @home cable internet.  The 'md' tacked on before the home.com
tells me Maryland (or StanMann guessed - or can reference @home's state
abbrev's somewhere, anyway they've always seemed straight forward to me...)
I'm in Washington state so my path ends wa.home.com - go figure.  Now the
only other thing, it looks like maybe you're in a city called Montgomery if
I interpret that abbreviation from the ID line properly.

So there you go, dude using @home cable in Maryland =)

Don't piss Stan off btw or he might advertise your IP address to alt.2600
hehehe
