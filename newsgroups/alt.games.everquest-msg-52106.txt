Dunno.  Maybe your guild message  board.  Maybe your server
message board.  Maybe your bulletin board at work, if you're
lucky enough to play with some folks from there.  Maybe at
school, same reason as previous.

EVERY server has a message board.  It's not run by VI or
sony, but I haven't seen a server yet that doesn't have it's
own EZ Board posting site.  And if your guild doesn't have a
website, I remember posting on an Uber-guild's (on my
server) website and asking (1) if it was ok to do this, and (2)
if I could grab some bored high-levels help at  a time that
was convienent to them.  Worked like a charm.
