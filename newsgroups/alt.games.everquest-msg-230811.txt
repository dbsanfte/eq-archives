I don't use Alla for charater profiles because I don't want to pay for the
premium service.  One largest problem with Alla is the insane number of
popups if you don't have the premium membership, which to some degree I can
understand because thousands of people just like me are getting free
information at the expense of ludacrious popups.  I don't use premium Magelo
either, but once you have a Magelo profile set up it isn't that hard to keep
it up to date.  I also prefer the way Magelo displays all the information.
I find the character data more approachable when it is set up like a
character inventory rather than just a list of slots and items the way Alla
does it.

Why would I use Magelo over Alla?  It is free, provides an approachable and
graphic way of seeing a characters equipment and stats, and other people can
view it without having to deal with the Alla popups if they don't have a
premium membership.
