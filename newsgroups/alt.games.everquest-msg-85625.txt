I can't speak for other enchanters, but no, I don't use them very much at my
level (56) because that's (Rune V, which also uses peridots) a one-time (up
to) 700hp damage absorber that costs 10.5p to cast, and it takes NO time to
go through at the level you get the spell.  It's EXTREMELY useful in limited
situations, but if it's "Rune or Die" as a regular buff, you're group is
really doing something wrong.

I much prefer Berserker Spirit (49) to cast on myself and other non-tanks.
It's a free 200hp damage absorber (don't cast on tanks unless it's an
emergency, it removes their STR buff).  It still takes no time to get
through those hps, but it's useful more often as a regular buff than Rune.
I use it often when there's only one healer in my xp group and it's not a
cleric. :)
