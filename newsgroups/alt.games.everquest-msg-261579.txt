hello,

i have an issue with the EQ options editor program that seems to have
spawned in my EQ directory since a few month, prolly since i installed GoD.
It never worked, when i try to run it i get a "Microsoft Visual C++ Library
Runtime Error" and it crashes.
I tried to delete the .exe file and run the patcher again but the new
fetched file seems to be foobar aswell.

Does anyone has encountered the same problem and maybe how could i fix it ?

thx.
