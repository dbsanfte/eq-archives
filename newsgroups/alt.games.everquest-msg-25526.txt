Fine, you didn't keep asking him, but you're whining about it here.
And at 45, that level 29 spell still takes a decent chunk of mana.
(450 to group gate out and self gate back)
Exactly what he is doing is irrelevant. He didn't want to leave it to
do a port for less than 70 pp and was in his full right to say so,
especially in a zone where there's usually no problem finding someone
porting for donations if you wait a little while.
