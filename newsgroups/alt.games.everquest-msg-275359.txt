BBC News has a story on their website about on-line games titled,
"Losing yourself in online gaming" which talks about games like EQ and
WoW, and how some people wind up getting "addicted" to playing them,
saying, "Gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an
unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym,
in front of the television, or reading poetry."  The complete article
