A friend wentto High School at Newport High in California. He told me
that the student parking had better, more expensive and newer cars
that the teachers parking lot. There are kids that have parents that
just throw money at them to keep them occupied. Ya never know with an
EBayer. Might be an adult that feels that they should get value for
their money or might be a kid that doesn't care.
