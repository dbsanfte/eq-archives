What is fun about the game is all the things you mentioned, but you haven't
been able to discover yet. Why, i don't know.

The people in my guild are all about my age, 30. In inviting new memebers to
the guild we make sure that they are nice people it looks like we will enjoy
having around. We don't go on the huge raids, we are not uber and we are a
small guild. What we do have is a relationship with each other that makes us
want to help each other out. yesterday we were hunting in Lguk for fun,
holding Frenzy with three 50 chars. A lower level guildie (40) was invited
to join us and when he showed we gave him a present we'd picked up earlier,
a Flowing Black Silk Sash. This item could have brought us 2k in cold cash,
but we gave it away for free to him because we didn't need it for our own
chars but he did. The same thing had happened to us when we joined the guild
at earlier times, so we continued the trend. he was speechless and grateful,
and I reckon he'll do the same thing to some other guildie later.

This is the reason I play Everquest. It's much of the reason peopole hang in
chatrooms, but here you also get the game experience. My friends on it (and
there aren't all that many, considering the 2 years I've played) are really
my friends, only we live in different parts of the world.

XPing, Raid, leveling, loot... All these things come into consideration at
some point, but the game is supposed to be a social affair and it only
becomes thus if you manage to make it so yourself....
