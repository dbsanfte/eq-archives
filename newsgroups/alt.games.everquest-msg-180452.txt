I've been playing at 1280x1024.  I find it too hard to read the tiny text at
1600x1200, but it seems to work OK.  I had a problem the other day with the
dead monster items window running off the left side of the screen, but they
fixed that problem.  The one thing I can't seem to get rid of is the extra
(windows) mouse pointer frozen in the middle of my screen.  It's merely
annoying when I try and click on something and realize I'm looking at the
wrong pointer.  The published fixes have had no benefit, and I'm getting
used to it, so I'm going to wait and see if it goes away.

Cheers,
Eric
