NBG works really great if you're in a guild hunt, or partying with
friends that you know will be hunting with you a lot in the future.
For pickup groups, however, it's a lousy concept.  Hey, sure, I'll
camp a pair of Colbalt boots for Random_Warror_04, but do you think
he's gonna be there next week to help me get my GEBs or Thrug quest
armor?  Of course not, I'm never gonna see this yahoo again.

NBG is a scam used by classes that actually have worthwhile things
that drop.  You'll never see these guys claiming NBG if it's not
*thier* class armor.
