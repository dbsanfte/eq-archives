Get used to it. Conning something only tells you somethings relative 
level, not the difficulty of the fight (example... if you are level 22, 
a mob that cons white to you will be level 22 too). As you go up in 
levels, you'll find that mobs of your same level are considerably more 
powerful than you. In your fifties, get used to have your butt handed to 
you by greens.

Certain strategies allow some caster classes to handle a handful of 
whites or yellows well into their fifties, but not often. For example, I, 
as a Druid, can handle a yellow-conning undead Elysian, but that's 
probably the only one mob in the whole game I can kill of that level. 
Every other yellow or white would be wearing me for a hat in no time.
