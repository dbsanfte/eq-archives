Mana regen.
Snare.

Haste.
Melee Debuff I believe.

Resist buff.

Do you care about every single utility spell?  Levitate for example?

Ports, evac should be here.

Clerics also get a str buff but I don't think you would want to
include it on their list.  The Enchanter AC buff is pretty weak.

> Pet - Unable to control

I wouldn't include this.  It brings almost nothing to the group, as it
is purely defensive.

Add group resist magic, it comes in handy and chanters always cast it
when applicable.

Add illusions, which can add stats or abilities.

>   - Magician

Call of the Heroes.

Summon CR gear.

Summon some specialy items, such as levitation rings, haste rings,
etc...

>   - Monk
> Feign Death

Probably the fourth best tank, only liability is the lack of taunt.

>   - Necromancer

Fear.
Rez for a price.
Summon corpses.
Stat buffs that steal from the MOB and give to the group.

>   - Paladin
> Stat Buff - HP, AC

LOL yeah, and very good at pissing off rangers who just got done
buffing Strength of Nature and have the Paladin overwrite it with
Brell's.

Rez.

>   - Ranger

Heal, Regen on par with the Beastlords.

> Stat Buff -

Good strength buff.  Crappy Agility Buff.

Fire and cold resists.

HP and AC buffs.

And most important of all for rangers are the pure attack buffs.

> Melee

At higher levels, archery.

> Harmony - Outdoor only
> Tank - Limited

Rangers get taunt.  I noticed you listed it for Paladins.  They dont
want to use it most of the time but it's there.

You also forgot Damage Shield, including some little ones that stack
with others.

>   - Rogue

Disarm traps.

LOL, and recover corpses in The Hole.

>   - Shadow Knight

Attack buff that seems to stack with everything that I know of anyway.

Summon corpses.  
Track corpses.

>   - Shaman
> Stat Buff - Str, Dex, Agi, Sta, AC, HP

What AC buffs do Shaman have?

SOW, including Billy, which is an attack buff.

Melee Debuff.

Oh and they have this little spell called haste that some people like.

<g>

>   - Wizard
> Port - Single Target Xloc, and Group port

May want to add evac to that, under "ports".

---

Several caster classes get some sort of resist debuff.  

Shaman get the Malo line.
Chanters (maybe all int classes?  I dont know) get Tash.
Druids can debuff fire and cold resists I think.
Not sure about others.

...These can help a group out a lot.
