Exactly. You have to remember that, though you were a much higher level 
and possibly more experienced to know that his tangling with that 
particular mob may be a bad idea, it's really not up to you to decide 
whether he does so or not. If you want to help in that situation, the 
best thing you can do is sit back and cover his tail as necessary, or 
simply ask if he needs any help.

You know what they say about good intentions. ;)
