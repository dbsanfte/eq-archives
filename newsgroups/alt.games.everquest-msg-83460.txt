| Here is your proof both Brad Mcquaid and Jeff Butler are gone and the

Let me help you, you hopeless little DAOC troll/fanboy.  A little game
called Ultima Online has turned over more developers than shotcallers at a
McDonald's restaurant in it's 4+ years.  Dying?  Sure, but then we are all
aren't we?

Using this as an argument that a game is on it's last leg is moronic.

| Penny Arcade takes on Sony's Kelly Flock. Flock was recently quoted in
Edge
| magazine about how he loves customer input.

This quote is so old, and the really neat thing, nobody gave a shit when it
first surfaced, and care even less now.  Did you just get out on work
release?
