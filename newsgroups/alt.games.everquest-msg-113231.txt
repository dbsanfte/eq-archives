For the record, *I'm not bashing or bragging about any particular

Ok, but isn't that only on a "per hit" basis? All things being equal,
won't an experienced level 50 monk outdamage an experienced level 50
rogue at the end of the day?

What I meant was that it didn't appear that their weapons (and I
though h2h was strongly encouraged for monks) were all that much
better than other classes' options. The h2h damage table I saw was
like 8 dmg/36 dly at level 20. Sure h2h weapons would improve this, I
just have no idea how much.

That's closer to the kind of answer I was seeking and would therefore
make sense to me.

I understand it's built into the design of the game. I just wanted to
know *how* it was built in - how it was accomplished.

Thanks for all the insight everyone.
