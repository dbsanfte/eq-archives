Until I was big enough to run through without problems, every SINGLE 
flipping time I ran from Freeport to Halas.  

"Here's West Commons, Kodiaks, orc legionairres, and dervs want to eat 
you for dinner."

"Here's Kithicor.  And it's MIDNIGHT.  MUAAAA HA HA HA HA."

(/aside I haven't actually been in Kithicor between 9pm and 9am.  Today I 
ran in and saw a bunch of people shouting "who's kiting the general?" and 
a LOT of high levels at the zone line looking ready to run and one level 
50 something looking for a rogue to drag his corpse.  Needless to say, I 
waited for the all-clear shout. *g*)

The WORST part, however, was the Runnyeye/Gorge zone.  A friend told me 
it was safer than high hold so he showed me the way to go.  The very 
first time I got SLAMMED by about a dozen stuns running through Runnyeye 
and had to wait and heal before we attempted the Gorge.  THEN I got 
attacked by muddites and minos and got MORE stuns.  Every time after, my 
heart has literally pounded as I anxiously mashed down that 'run' and 
'strafe' key and prayed for slow trains. :)  Now I'm *fairly* safe - the 
minos in the gorge are still yellow, and I've only seen an evil eye once 
- but I have levitate and sow, and can run along the walls, out of the 
aggro range of most critters.
