At 33...I'm now hunting in Velious...very carefully though...

Right off the boat you should be able to pull kitty's to the gnome camp and
get some good exp...

Derv's in EW have some nice drops...

Giant Scouts in GD as well as Dire Wolfs...Kodiaks...they con blue and
yellow to me at 33.

It's a lot more challenging in Velious...I find myself doing a lot of hiding
from passing mobs but it makes it that much more exciting...I hate being in
a zone where I can beat the hell out of everything...
