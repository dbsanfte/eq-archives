Just out of curiosity, what would be better?  Put it all in stamina for
lich, and make up the int in armor?  Haven't looked at necro gear, is that a
feasable route?

/shudder I absolutely hated it.  Once I found Thurg mines, I was in hog
heaven.  All my toons are stopping there in their thrities..

Gwah!  Must be nice.

I couldn't bring myself to kill at the spires, I'm not KoS to the chickens.
Anyone know what's up between the Dwarfs and Aviaks, anyways?

Well, with a name like Dark Huntress, one would expect her to be hunting
something in particular.  Either she would be on mistmoore faction, hunting
players, or she could be on Bard or RoS faction, hunting followers of
Mistmoore.  I wonder why those two in particular are at odds... have the
vampires been targeting singers?  And, given the bard role as the historians
of norrath, shouldn't they call themselves League of Tunarian Bards?

Are you talking about the players or the developers?

Kinda makes you wish that Verant (yes, I know, SoE) understood the idea of
class balance.
