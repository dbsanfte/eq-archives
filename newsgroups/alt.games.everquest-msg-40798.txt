Trouble will be that not all qeynos factions are covered by Gnolls so
you could walk through the street some day but get blind sided by an
NPC who is on a faction table you haven't worked on who agros the
guards on you. On the other hand, when you hit level 60, you might be
"too red to the NPCs" to get attacked, not sure if that works that
way....
