    You're in any outdoor zone, pulling, and rain comes and wrecks your
visibility. Get rid of the rain. Especially if you're in a place where you
may pull more than you can handle if you can't see what's around when you
pull.

    It doesn't. At least not the one that ENCs cast on themselves. Neither
does the AA rune ability they can get.

    Death Pact, level 51 IIRC, uses a pearl. Divine Intervention, the level
60 spell, uses emeralds. Death Pact is weak, DI is a staple at the high end.

    I didn't see the original list - did anyone mention Avatar, speaking of
Emeralds?

    Mage pets use malachite. Necro/SK pets use bone chips, the 59+ necro
pets use peridots. Someone else listed the various types of coffins
necromancers use.

    And if you're talking about wizard spells, don't forget the spells to
port you to Hate and Sky. Those use very expensive reagents. Oh, and some
translocate spells use portal fragments.

    Imbues, Enchant X spells, mana vials, any of the "turn X into Y" spells.
