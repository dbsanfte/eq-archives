i can't find enough info.....checked lucy, but the info is incomplete or
wrong...

1: why do rangers have 3 (if not more?) jolt-type spells? more specifically,
what is the 3rd one?

- 51=jolt.....instant aggro decrease .......
- 54= jolting blades, a buff that procs jolt...
- 55=cinder jolt....what does cinder jolt do? lucy has conflicted
info..upgrade to jolt? to jolting blades? neither?

2: does call of earth (50) stack with force of nature (49) ? both add AC
...it seems call of earth is an upgrade to riftwind's protection...what line
is force of nature in?

(here's what lucy has to say:
- 49= force of nature
      slot2:  Increase Damage Shield by 3
      slot3:  Increase ATK by 15
      slot12:  Increase Hitpoints by 3 per tick


- 50= call of earth:
      slot2:  Increase Damage Shield by 4
      slot3:  Increase AC by 24 (L50) to 25 (L55)


and all i can respond with is, 'oh goody! i hope they stack!' )


all help appreciated
