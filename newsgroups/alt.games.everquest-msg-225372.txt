Have you checked for cooling problems?  Athlons run hot.  EQ is one of the
hottest games around, literally.  Many popular cases for homebuilts aren't
very good for air circulation, so unless you've used a case that is known
to have good cooling characteristics, used rounded cables, etc., it is worth
running some temperature monitoring software while you play EQ, and
alt-tabbing out to check it now and then, and see how hot that thing is
getting.  See if there is a correlation between the temperature and the
lock-ups.  Try those other games that don't have problems, and see if they
reach the temperature EQ does.
