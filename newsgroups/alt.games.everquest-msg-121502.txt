Yet you STILL can't supply any evidence except "take my word

books, magazines, etc.  *I* have done so.

I'm more than willing to keep an open mind, but "take my word
for it" just doesn't cut it, Dark Tyger.

Your obvious bias makes your observations suspect, to say the
least.  And without any supporting evidence, I'm not sure why
you expect me to believe you.

What part of this are you having a hard time understanding?
Or would you prefer to just continue with the ad hominem
attacks?

Personally, my interest is learning the facts, even if that
means I'm wrong.  You don't seem interested in anything but
shooting the occasional insult and making unsubstantiated
claims.

You'll note that you had similar problems with your debating
style in the recent "feign death" thread.

SUPPORT YOUR CLAIMS.  I don't CARE if you think you're an
expert on the subject matter.  *I* found evidence to support
mine and supplied the URLs.  Why can't you?

Could it be because cats *aren't* considered pack animals?!

Nah...you're a self-proclaimed Cat Expert.  You can't possibly
be wrong and don't need any supporting evidence whatsoever.

An unconfirmed personal opinion.  How scientific...not.

: Housecats are pack
: animals, just not to the rather high degree that wolves are.

Whatever you say.
