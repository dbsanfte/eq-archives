GF4200TI is DX9 compatible. 
All that statement means is that you can load DX9 on the computer
containing the card and it doesn't catch fire (the computer or the
card).

But the DX9 features that are unique to DX9 are not compatible with
that card.
I suppose it is possible to do something in software, seems like
anything can be emulated in software, but it will suck.

Now GF4200TI does have T&L.

Bottom line:
Star Wars Galaxies will run on it.  But don't expect jaw dropping
graphics.  You need a newer card for that.

No one is mentioning ATI.
There are two ATI cards, the 9700 and the 9800, both support the DX9
featureset (they run the DX9 code) and both have 128 megs of DDR
memory.
These cards will produce jaw dropping graphics.

I have the 9700 and it is just sweet.

You might want to check it out.
The Nvidia cards have been getting trashed recently.  There is a huge
controversy about them cheating in the 3dMark tests.  They also take
up 2 slots, the AGP and the 1st PCI slot.

If I had to buy now I would go ATI.  If I could afford to wait 6
months I would and see what Nvidia has in the tubes.
However the FX cards appear to be stillborn.
I wouldn't buy one.
