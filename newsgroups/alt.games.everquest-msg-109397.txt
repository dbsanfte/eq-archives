Not at all. "Survival of the fittest" may the way things work in nature. 
This doesn't make it good or evil. Good and Evil are purely human terms, 
and are only applicable to human affairs. I'm not meaning by this that 
Good and Evil don't exist, only that "survival of the fittest" applies to 
"good and evil" as much as the Laws of Leverage or any other natural 
principles, i.e., very little indeed.
