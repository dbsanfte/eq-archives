Given that normally, the way I look for a rez or a port is to ooc that I am
paying for one, the fact that someone is or is not anon is immaterial.  I
almost never send a direct tell to someone asking for either.  Last night I
made an exception, as I died at the feet of a level 60 cleric at a Luclin
portal that was going to fire in 3 minutes.  He rezzed, I looted, ported up
just as I grabbed the last item off my corpse.  Cleric booked on out of
Nexus before I could even pay him.  I don't like it when people send me
tells for buffs, and so, I assume that they may feel the same way, and I do
not send them tells.  If someone is interested in making some cash or
helping me out, they respond to the ooc, if not, I don't bug them.
