Um, no, it's not. That most certainly *is* the sort of thing that is
very likely to happen when code is manipulated without the least bit of
testing. I know of which I speak. If nothing else, programmers will run
the code as a safeguard against simple syntax errors.

Who knows? Certainly neither you nor I. What is much more certain,
however, is that they don't just throw in redesigns of such magnitude
without *any* testing. Not a chance. My guess is, as I suggested, the
testing they *did* was merely not as thorough as it should have been.
Perhaps the person (it's quite possible there was only one, again, who
knows) responsible for testing this new mechanism, didn't do much beyond
triggering the AA's and making sure the text popped up in the chat
window and the game didn't crash as a result. Maybe they just assumed in
that case that all was working.

You're applying pie in the sky requirements to a shoestring budget,
9-year-old MMORPG. For crying out loud, the resources necessary to come
up with the sort of testing facilities upon which you insist should be
in place for *all* program functions would quite likely require more
manpower than they have devoted to the entire game at this time. I
really think you need to temper your expectations a bit.

Again, we don't know whether they do or not. Debating that point from
either side would be...well...pointless. It certainly shouldn't be used
to bolster an argument. 

Bottom line: anyone who says they implement game redesigns without any
testing is either loopy or just being a malcontent.
