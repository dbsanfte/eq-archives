Of course, monk shammy is the tried and true default. But I've seen monk
druid kick some serious ass also. Never really considered monk necro,
but you know, it could work. Necros can fight with anyone or nobody and
do well, so why not?
Anybody with some healing would be fine and speed up the process. Of
course, a monk with a mage could have a hell of a pet to backup tank and
could summon unlimited bandages and weight reduction bags so the monk
could *gasp* actually carry loot and make money. (Not that your twink is
likely to need it, but still.)
