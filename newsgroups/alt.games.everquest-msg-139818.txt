Psst... EQ, I just thought you should know... If you ever played 
Everquest, you would find that all it is, really, is a real-time chatroom 
with a videogame stuck to it.  As I recall, it even supports IRC commands 
now, although I've become ingrained in the habit of using /tell instead of 
/msg, and /em instead of /me.  So, us over here who play Everquest?  Yes, 
we can generally hang quite well in a real-time conversation, spread 
over seven or eight different channels, and usually play a rather complex 
videogame at the same time.  Many of us can even play more than one 
character at a time, further increasing the number of channels to monitor.
