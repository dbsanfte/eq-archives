Already have Run 3.  Spend a lot of my grinding time duoing with my
wife's necro.  Yes, the necro can heal me between fights and we use the
eye of zomm trick to get her back up in health afterwards, but it's slow
and mana consuming, tedious.  Being a wizard, I'm limited to 100 in bind
wounds skill, but with this AA I could get to 80% health pretty fast
which is enough to go pull with.

So it might be useful for me a bit more often. Not decided yet, though.
