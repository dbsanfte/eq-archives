*If* there was, in fact, any sort of GM retaliation, my guess would
also be that it was for something said in a direct /tell to the GM
that honked them off. There is no telling what your guildie may have
said that you never saw.

That being said, stranger things have happened than a mob just
despawning for no reason. I would be big time disappointed as well,
but I don't think there is enough evidence to point the finger at the
GM.
