Spaying/neutering may be preferable if dumping pets is the only alternative. 
I wouldn't go so far as to call that being responsible.  I equate that with
having car insurance and going out and ramming random cars you meet on the
road being considered "responsible" because, hey, you're covered.

There are millions of unwanted children born every year.  I assume you are
in favor of mandatory sterilization/abortion for people deemed unworthy of
parenthood.
