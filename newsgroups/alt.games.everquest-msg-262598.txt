Very easy question I suppose, but that depends on the answer.

Recently downloaded OOW, well yesterday actually, but as usual, I didnt take 
much notice of how to get to any of the zones/cities etc...

Have seen wallsofslaughter, provinggrounds, and assume these are zones of 
OOW?

So a quick and easy explanation as to how one goes about getting to any/all.

Thanks in anticipation. BTW Im level 62 druid, with 54 warrior on second 
account.
