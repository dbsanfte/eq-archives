EQ is a rural life simulator.  You can hunt, fish, camp and make moonshine.
An upcoming expansion will let you pick cotton.

Sometimes you will type many things and never hit upon a response they want

Never fight anything that might kill you.  Never fight more than a few feet
from a guard or a zone.  Fish a lot.
