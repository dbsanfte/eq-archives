I picked an Erudite as an Enchanter. This has a Race exp penalty because of
the advantage of high int to start, as with Ogre warriors have high str/sta.

The race penalty was never really a problem. Was noticeable when I partnered
with a same lvl druid friend. He would make a yellow and I made 4.5 blues.

Ding 61!

Wow the race penalty has gone mental. Barb Warrior and Dwarf cleric get 10%
of lvl 61 in same time I got 5-6% this is effectively a 100% penalty.
Methinks a program number cruncher in VI code is a little off.
