When we were doing the General in Echo Cavens (I think there), you had to
pull NPC trainers across the zone to make room for someone else to pull the
general.

The problem I observed with my monk, is that I only have a short range to
throw something at them.  By the time i turned around I was rooted and dead
after the onslaught of 3 level 60+ NPC casters.  With our SK, he was able to
use some long range arrows, stay out of the spell casting ranges of the npcs
and successfully feign death in the corner of the zone.

In this instance I would say SK.

On the other hand, monks dont need to cast a spell for it to work which will
work better in some situations.  With AA you can knock down the reuse time
as well.

Just my experiences.
