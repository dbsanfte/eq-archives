Yeah, it's still enough of a challenge to my 52 Paladin to
be exciting (even if every damned thing *is* green and I
get no exp), I've had fun exploring it, since I never
went there earlier in my "career".  It's fun trying to
farm Ravenscale and Darkforge armor, too.

And the biggest train I've ever seen in the game was in CT,
a door flew open in the courtyard and what came out made it
look like someone was spraying lizards from a fire hose.
