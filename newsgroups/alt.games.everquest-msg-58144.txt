Leaving aside the stupidity of assisting anyone in any way to take out the
minions of the goddess that the original posters' character worships.  The
issue was that no faction messages were display, and therefore, there was no
hint that faction was a problem.  One assumes, perhaps incorrectly, that
said person would have stopped, and left had there been any hint of the
faction changes taking place.  My personal feeling is, well, tough shit, you
assisted others in invading the home of the goddess that you worship, suffer
the consequences.
