My wife started playing before me, (though the game was ostensibly purchased
"for me") and she was the one who got *me* hooked and we had to get a second
account for me.  So, I've never had to deal with any of those particular
"faction problems".  Last week it was me who was in bed at normal time and she
dragged herself in three hours later because they had a guild meeting that
didn't start till some obscene hour because of people in distant time zones.
We've also both set alarm clocks to get up a one in the morning together to go
on guild raids with people in other countries.  Nope...... no complaints here
either.
