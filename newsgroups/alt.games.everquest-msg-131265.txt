      Hello,

      Upgraded to the latest nVidia drivers 29.42 and ever since then we
have had problems with EQ. Anyone else having these problems ? We changed
the video card to a GF2 GTS Pro, 64 MB DDR, still locking up. Also changed
memory, did a clean install of OS and EQ, new sound card drivers, new NIC,
new hard drive.

    Athlon 1 GHz, not OC
    arctic silver thermal paste
    huge heatsink and fan
    IWill KK266 motherboard with KT133A chipset
    on board C media sound with newest driver
    Plextor 8x 4x 32x CD RW
    Enlight case with 300 w PS
    Samsung 256 MB, PC133
    W98 SE, clean install
    3COM NIC

    This is connected with cable modem, EQ on another computer on same
network, runs like a champ

    Any ideas would be greatly appreciated, such as driver issues, OS, CD RW
drives, whatever problems you had with EQ and how did you fix them

    thanks in advance ~ John and David aka Buffman
