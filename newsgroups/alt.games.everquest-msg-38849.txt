Tell me about it...

Even some of my good friends in the game who happen
to be very clever seem to lose 40 IQ points when
they play their Druids.

"Oh, sorry, I didn't have Heal memmed..."  *slap*

"Is there any special reason you didn't Snare those
three mobs that were beating the crap out of us in
this wide-open outdoor zone so that we could get
some distance from them?"  "Um, didn't think of it,
sorry."

[48 Druid dies 12 seconds into a fight]  "What
happened?"  "He started hitting me real hard."
"It was snared and the tanks were on it, how'd
it reach you?"  "I was meleeing."

I'm going to send them all to Druid school,
I swear.
