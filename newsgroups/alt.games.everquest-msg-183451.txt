Necros have the ability to suck the life force out of a player ( who 
consents to it ) and store that lifeforce in an Essence Emerald.  This 
kills the player ( with no chance of a Rez ) and let's the Necro use that 
Emerald to Rez someone.  They can probably get that level back in 30 
minutes grouping with a level 60 bard who is swarm-kiting somewhere, so 
it's not too bad these days to die like that.

There are level restrictions on the person that sacrifices thsemselves for 
teh Emerald, but I don't know what they are.

Can't help you with this, bit I'd guess you are ok.

There is a bank there, at the bottom of a loooong cliff-side path.  You 
can't levitate in Katta, so you have to walk down the whole path.  Kill 
Selos and hug the left wall to get down safely.  When you zone into Katta, 
go through the archway and you will have a path go off to the left shortly.  
Take that path and you will soon come to an opening to your right that 
leads down some stairs that take you to the looooong walk to the bank 
waaaaaay below.

Don't fall off.  It hurts.
