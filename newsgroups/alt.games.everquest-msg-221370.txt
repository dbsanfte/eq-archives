    Well, before my sense heading was much good, I *did* buy and use a
compass constantly. I'm not sure what you expected yours to do, but mine
told me what direction I was facing.

    Giving yourself completely unnecessary disadvantages isn't fun. I do
have to respect the fact that you didn't enjoy old eq style travel - that's
okay, but you can't tell me current travel is fun either. I still spend
about half my time running, but now the other half is spent looking at a
"loading, please wait" screen as I zone, instead of working WTH I am.

    What was fun about travel was the challenge of it, the sense of
achievement, the danger factor. The same things that give me a buzz today
when I stealth from the zoneline in Veksar to nobles without getting agrod.
If that kind of tension isnt fun I don't know what is :)

    I don't think he was alledging there was any "Thrill" to it. A "thrill"
is a short term sensation, and I imagine a three week camp resulting in a
near-priceless reward is more an accomplishment and an elite club sort of
thing than a "thrill". And most people never subjected themselves to those
insane levels of mindless tedium. Owning a pair of jboots, amoung other
things, is a badge of extreme patience and persistence, or obscenely good
luck. Or of being on the FV server and having a lot of money.

    I find this paragraph ridiculous to the point where it's barely worth
responding to. It's clearly a fallacious conclusion but I can't offhand pick
the category, does anyone know how to say "fucking insane" in latin?

    But seriously, yes EQ produces good and bad times, and always had. The
bad things teach you lessons (EQ teaches fewer lessons nowadays though) and
make you appreciate the good things.
