At the risk of feeding even more trolls, I feel should point out what
you've written above is a lie.  Julie never told Annie to do anything.
She asked.

Of course the real reason why Annie, and indeed others, took offense at
Julie's request had nothing to do with the intent or meaning of Julie's
post.  Julie simply didn't give Annie, a doyonne of alt.games.everquest,
the respect Annie and others feels Annie deserves.

Welcome to comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg, it's not the small little pond
you're used to.
