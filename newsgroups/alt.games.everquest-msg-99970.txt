No, you could around east and west already. Orcs DON'T raise efp wfp
guards, THEY NEVER HAVE. They raise

Knights of truth (NORTH freep palladins/guild/guards)
Ashen order (WEST freeport monks guild, easily avoidable anyway)
Guardians of the vale(MISTY/RIVERVALE halfling guards (lil zorro guys)
Commons Residents (mostly some commonds vendors who are not on
freeport vendor factions, they are about half of the vendors in the
commons)

So its those 4. East and west freeport guards are the
FREEPORT MILITIA
Killing orcs does not alter them, turning in DEATHFIST BELTS
in west freeport to capt Hazz on the balcony DOES raise militia and it
lowers

Knights of truth (north freep guards)
Priests of marr (north freep cleric guild, easily avoidable)
Steel warriors  (west freep warrior guild, easily avoidable)

No, it requires a ton of orc/pawn killing. They are knights of truth.
For something new kill the 3 new orc camps in nek woods (your newb
zone) They raise the same factions.

I feel for you. For some reason MANY people lately have the idea that
killing orcs is helping to raise east and west freeport guards. Some
have even posted this on the official eq messageboard. It DOESN'T.
