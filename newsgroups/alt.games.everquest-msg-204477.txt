I have to admit I'm guilty of doing this.

Sometimes it not my fault, sometimes you end up searching for a trader only
to discover the Gnome you need has been "eaten" by a rather large ogre and
inspecting her is touch and go.
But othertimes I might have just got an item and will be wondering back
towards the bank when I just have to see what that naked troll is selling,
and I have to admit i've picked up more than a few bargains this way, things
I didnt want, but I re-sold at a massive profit.
