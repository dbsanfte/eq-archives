No, depending on how it is implemented, it will be damned handy for 
avoiding consuming stat food and drink.  I always have all my primary 
inventory slots filled with bags, so it has always been not worth the 
trouble to me to force feed/drink.  This may make it easy to do, and 
worthwhile now.

Melee in general, but, I bet bards will seriously rejoice.

Time will tell if it will have any effect on you in such a situation.  I 
would not put it past them, but, on the other hand, I won't assume it's 
going to be a problem until it is a problem.

There are plenty of guilds out there that do not require time 
commitments.

I really don't understand why you bother to continue playing to be 
honest, with the attitude you display regarding the game here in 
general...
