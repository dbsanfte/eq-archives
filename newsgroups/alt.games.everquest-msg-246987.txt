I'd say no. Don't do it. As much as I despise nVidia, there is probably some
other root cause. What exactly it is I cannot say. Look at your MB drivers,
reinstall DX9,  try removing the texture cache files and moving the ini file
out of your directory and see if that changes anything. etc...

Sorry I can't be of much help but I'm about a year removed now from any real
EQ time.

Most of the DX9 parlor tricks that your card won't support isn't going to
kill you anyway.
