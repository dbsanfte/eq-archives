Ouchie.  That I didn't know.  Thank goodness stuff in NFree *did* 
tolerate me, then...  I'm level 15, and I only plan on checking out the 
first level, so that should be pretty safe, I guess, if allakhazam's is 
any indication.  Now since I've been away for so long I'll have to ask - 
did the DEs leave because somebody completed a quest, or did Verant just 
remove them again for no apparent reason?

Thanks. I just read about the BR last night and was wondering if I 
should quest for it or not. (What's an EBW?)

I've been away way, WAY too long.  (You would have enjoyed my reaction 
to finding out about the spellbook removal...)
