How old is she?  I think this may matter to some extent.  If she is young
and inexperienced communicating online joining a guild right off could make
the enjoyment level swing either way, depending on the quality of the people
in that guild.  Tough call.  Personally, I have not yet found a guild that
has a full set of genuinely Good People who understand the game (the fact
that it IS just a GAME) and know how to have FUN with it as opposed to
making it a chore.

Suffice it to say, i think your suspicions are correct - the new guilds
probably just want her because she is a cleric and will be able to rez one
day - but whether she will actually get that cleric to level 39 is another
matter entirely.  Guilds that have a level requirement to get in are
generally very good, i have found.  I have seen one guild go downhill once
they dropped their lvl 35 minimum requirement for new recruits - a lot of
very inexperienced, easily-discouraged, mouthy, easily-flustered, generally
confused players joined and sullied the guilds reputation (which wasn't
uber) IMO.

My recomendation to EVERYONE would be, play your first char to level 35-40
without a guild, learn about the game, figure out the mechanics and see if
you like it. If you get there and are having a good time, you will find your
'guild home' quicker than you think.

On the other hand, if she joins a guild and doesnt like it, /guildremove is
a pretty simple command to issue to get out, and learn to /ignore the people
who pester you about leaving.  Make sure she realizes that sticking with a
guild isn't essential to keeping her reputation - sometimes it may be the
other way around.  And there will always be a guild wanting a cleric =)

As an aside, i think the original idea Verant had behind a guild was a group
of players who enjoyed playing together, had basically the same play times
and wanted to have their own chat channel and the pseudo-prestige of having
a Guild Name associated with their character.  There are really no other
benefits to having a guild, other than chat channel and extra characters
above your head - the other stuff that people assume comes with a guild,
(twinking, help with quests, free stuff, always have a group, etc.) are
things that you only get if you are willing to put equal effort back into
them. (Nothing is free, sorry guys ;-)

Best wishes to you and your budding Cleric!

Huzzah!
