The only 2 times i walked through west karana it would say "you have a
fever", " you break out in a rash" and other such messages. Is there
any way to avoid this? i hadnt been bitten by any rabid animals that
roamed there and if it were due to cold weather then halas should have
done the same. are erudites susceptible to the pollen in the air from
all the fields?
