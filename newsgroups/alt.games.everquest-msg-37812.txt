I guess it depends on the Kobold... My first and only kill in Stonebrunt
so far was a Kobold named Ragnarok the Infuriated (had to change that to
Ragnarok the Deceased shortly after), and it gave me no faction hits at
all. I did collect his head, which I imagine can be handed in somewhere
in Cat City (if there really is one... i couldn't find it, myself) for
faction and hopefully XP.
