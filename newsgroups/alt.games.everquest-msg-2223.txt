That's fine for XP camps, since there are plenty of those to go around,
but it is not a fair way to handle camps for rare random items.  The two
problems with "it's mine until I leave" for those camps are:

1. It favors people who can put in very long play sessions.  A person
who can play a 36 hour session has a much higher chance of getting the
item than someone who can put in 4 sessions of 9 hours.  In a fair
system, you chances of getting a rare item should be proportional to
your play time, whether or not it is split over multiple sessions.

The long session is favored because of the time it takes to get the
camp.  Suppose it takes an average of 4 hours waiting for the previous
camper to leave.  The person who can play 36 hours straight gets 32
hours of camping in during his 36 hours.  The person who does 4 sessions
of 9 hours only gets 20 hours of camping out of 36 played hours.

2. It favors people in certain timezones and countries.
