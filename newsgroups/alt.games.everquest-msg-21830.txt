You're actually lucky.  The GM would normally not interfere...  when we were
in Fear (and had a terrible, terrible
breakin) a non-guildie who tagged along and was lev 46 delevelled and
couldn't get back into the plane.
I believe he petitioned... we saw a lead GM come into fear, just observe,
and then leave.  One of our
officers stayed out and tried to powerlevel the poor guy so he could get
back in... took a few hours.

1.  Moral of the story: dont rely on a GM to res you...
2.  Don't go into the planes until you're at least well into 46  :)
