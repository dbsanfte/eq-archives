Last night I was running to Akanon for some short business. I drive by
Clarity all the time, and I like doing it, along with charming Kobolds
or a fire beetle as a pet. Sometimes I buff and bind when asked, and I
often dont require anything more than a request, like Please. I always
say please and I encorage others to do so.

I was doing my thin by Akanon, running in, I must have Clar'ed about a
dozen lowbie Gnomes. Some Gnome Necro (I assume) said wait, I then got
a tell "wait!". I replied, "Yes?" he said "are you a Enchanter?" I
replied "yes, what can I do for you?".

The next Tell was "Come with me", I replied "Why?" "I need you come
with me", I replied "What for?". Obviously, this was a young'un or had
the manners of a badly behaved twelve year old.

I zoned and sent a tell "Find me if you need me" I then got "I need to
you Clar my friend so he can level faster", I then replied "I prefer
to be asked and not told what I am going to do. Find me in a few" He
then sent a tell "We GNomes don't need to ask elves we tell them" I
posted, "good, I am so happy for you bye", I got a tell "*moon" SO I
said "You dont need my help bye"

I am sure all chanters/druids/wizzy have a story like this of rudeness
and poor manners. WHeres Politenessman when you need him!
