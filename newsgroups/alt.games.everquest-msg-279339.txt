 Having run into some problems patching, I did a disc scan, as advised. Some
errors did indeed turn up.
  Nunevieu didn't make it.
  Her configuration file was apparently hopelessly corrupted. There was no 
backup.
  I quickly burned a backup CD with all other characters, but my level 40 
chanter is
unplayable now. Dang. Just as she was getting into the good parts.
  I'm not sure it matters. Adas hads been burning through AA's in the Plane 
of Fire;
she now has the extra spell gem, Secondary Recall, and is working toward the
next upgrade to her familiar, after which comes Teleport Bind. Then a bunch 
of
less-important things, like the Xuzl sword swarm and some increased 
durability.
  Other characters beckon, as well. Quellious seems to be a happening place; 
I
have created a ranger and paladin there, bought 200k plat, and got a 
suitable
set of twink gear for them. Ranger Keaolasi is already into her mid-30's. 
The
pally is yet another attempt to trace the career of Firiona Vie; no Paludal 
Caverns
grind for her, she will be doing all old world zones at least into her 
mid-40's.
When I get around to her.

  Some recent changes I haven't mentioned...
  I like the change to the mob spawning in Everfrost. When I made Grugg, 
there were
relatively few mobs in the newbie area outside Halas. Now it's a madhouse. 
Best
is when I take my beasltlord and just hit f8 and pet attack in chain, 
clearing my
field of view in minutes, farming spiderling silks. (You have to kill 
EVERYTHING
to make sure spiderlings spawn evenly.)
  Healing spell boosts are tremendous. Minor Healing has doubled in 
effectiveness,
from 10hp to 20hp. Lesser Healing is even better, from 30 up to 65. Regular
Healing is not so highly boosted, only 75%, going from 100hp to 175, but 
this
has a tremendous effect on the relevant levels of beastlords and rangers 
that use it.
Much less downtime, you see.
  Re-assigning levels of spells is a similarly huge boost. Many spells have 
come down
in level, making their benefits available earlier. Temperance is now 
castable at level
40! That increases the chances of finding a Temp when you need one.
  It's really too bad that Mistmoore and Splitpaw have been revamped, now 
that I
have characters in thier mid 30's again. With modern gear and buffs, 
Keaolasi could
tear up SP. Dalnir, OTOH, just ate her up; damn DoTting mobs, necros that 
cast
Dooming Darkness - not a fun place to solo.

  I may have discovered a guild I can raid with on weekdays. Saviours claims 
to raid
9am to 2pm, Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I can live with 
that...
but lately when I've gotten up and logged on at 9am, they haven't always 
been doing any
raids. I'll try an app anyhow, just to see if it's worth the effort.

  On to the usual grind. I have the alts disease really bad. Need to focus 
on one per week,
I think...
