Oh, come on now, people. The one time it happened to me, it was between 
spawns and I was TL'ed out, no harm done, no hard feelings beyond my own 
feeling foolish. The reason I didn't bail earlier was that someone else 
had mentioned needing to leave soon and the concensus was that if one 
left the rest might go too, it being a very small party to begin with. We 
just needed a couple more spawns for our tanks to get their quest items, 
therefore, I decided to try and stick it out a while longer. When all 
you're doing is playing mana song for ten or fifteen minutes or so at 
2:30am, however...

Point is, it's no different than someone making a mistake and snaring 
themselves or nuking the wrong mob or bringing an unwanted train back to 
your party or anything else that might actually get someone killed or 
cause a wipe. Like I said, it happened *once*. It's not like it was no 
big deal to me either. 

The self-righteous can look at it any way they want, but the fact is that 
shit happens. You just do your best to try and prevent it and move on.
