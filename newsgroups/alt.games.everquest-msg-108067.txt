Throw him in the killfile...time to move on.  We've all spent way too much
time trying to get him to participate like a halfway decent human being.
His abuse is little more than a source of entertainment for him, and at his
age he's not likely to do much growing up so I think it's time to just write
him off.

I wonder what Ben is going to reply to this.  I guess I'll never know.  I
wonder if that's going to bug the heck out of him?  Guess I'll never know.
I bet it will, though.  Ben can't stand it when someone else gets the last
word in.

I bet it will bug Ben a lot.
