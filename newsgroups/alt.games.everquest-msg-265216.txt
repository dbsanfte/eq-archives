Well, the simplest method I've found for gaining the coin is to either quest 
or craft.

But you really don't need to worry about it too much.  Note that you do have 
7 days to come up with that 5s.  In fact, you can't pay the rent on the room 
in advance, you have to wait until the 7 days is up.  So you don't have to 
get the rent quickly.

I guess the exception to this would be the truly casual player who only gets 
in maybe a couple of hours of gaming a week.  For them, the most profitable 
quests would probably be the inner-city quests, some of which (but not all) 
can give a few silver at lower levels.  But you need citizenship (and hence 
either level 7 adventurer or level 6 artisan) to start those.
