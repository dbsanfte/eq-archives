Guk is hot and cold. It's decent xp for sure. The thing to watch when
soloing is the aggro - like most dungeon environs the aggro can be high at
times. Must like Sol A, which used to be overcamped all the time, Guk has
fallen mightily as people have moved onto the perceived higher xp and loot
in other zones (for the 30 or so crowd, Marrus Seru and Dawnshroud come to
mind on the moon, plus, to a lesser extent, EW). There are a ton of other
zones to hunt around 30, so people have become more spread out.

Personally, I would not do LGuk solo, and I'm 34. I do like the place
though....

So after a few months away from eq I thought I'd dust off my rogue and see
where I left him off.  Turns out he was in OverThere.  I hunted there for a
bit in a group, got bored and split back to mainland to give lower guk a
shake.  The rogue is level 31, I meet up with a warrior, druid and a wiz and
we did the spider room / bedroom area.  It went well until warrior pulled
the wizard ledge or something and we got a slew of froggies.  Our wiz did
evac, but unfortunately the tank bit it.

Well that was my exciting introduction paragraph, now for some generic
stuff.  When I was in guk with these guys, it was pretty darn empty, only
around 20 people or so and this was on a Sunday ~12pm CST.  Is it always
this dead?

Any hints on soloing here as a rogue in the event I can't find a group in
the future?  I remember the old days pre Kunark, this zone was bursting at
the seams with people, now they all split from the mainland.  Pikers...

I'm not really after phat lewts or anything (at least yet), rather I'd like
to get a bit more XP under my belt.
