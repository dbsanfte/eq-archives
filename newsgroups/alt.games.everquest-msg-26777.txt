You wouldn't have been wrong to let him die. Unless you're in his
group, or his guild, you are not obligated to help him.

Personally I think helping him the first time was the right thing to
do, even if he came across as obnoxious and demanding. I always try to
help people who are about to die, usually by healing them. CRs are not
fun. The second time the guy asked you for healing, I would have just
walked away.

I ran into a similar experience, if not quite as bad, while meding at
the docks in Oasis. Someone came up and said "Can u heal me?". I did
so without hesitation, even though I was only at 40m. Then they said
"Can u sow me?" I cast Spirit of Wolf on them and apologized to my
partner for the delay, since I was almost out of mana. Not 30 seconds
later the same guy came up to me and said "Can u heal me?" No
donations, no bows, just a "ty" the first time as he ran away.

Needless to say, I started meditating up the coast, away from the
dock.
