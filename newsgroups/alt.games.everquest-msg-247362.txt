Dammit, now you done got me brainstorming on this instead of work.  :p  You
couldn't have gotten the monk or warrior any more right!

How about an obvious:

Shaman: "Who Let The Dogs Out", by some group I'm too lazy to look up.
Especially after seeing that one AA of theirs in action.  Ok, I'm gagging myself
now.

/gags

Necros: "Dust and Bones" or "Live & Let Die", Guns and Roses
Enchanters: "Crackerman", Stone Temple Pilots

Thanks to another thread:
EQ: "Five Years Dead", Motley Crue.  Or "After The Thrill Is Gone", Eagles.

And the "Lay Your Hands On Me" was Bon Jovi.

Bah I better get back to work.  :)  Couldn't think of a real good one, besides
the already mentioned one for their DS.  Or Blades nuke line, "Cuts Like a
Knife", Bryan Adams.
