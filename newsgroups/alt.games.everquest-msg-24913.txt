Kinda reminds me of the lvl 27 necro that was camping the hermit in
SK. "It's great xp". I was 19 at the time. Told him he surely could
find _much_ better xp out there than a mob 7 levels under him (Hermit
always spawns as a lvl 20). If I could take the hermit, there was far
better out there he could take. He told me I was lying to him about
being able to take the hermit solo because it almost killed him every
time. I told him it rarely touched me, I fear kited it. 

Him: "What's fear kited mean?" 
Me: *bangs head on desk*
