Wait wait wait....this is America (making a big assumption here, but
necessary for the sarcasm), the land of blame, not the land of personal
responsibility.  Here we don't take personal responsibility for our actions,
we blame our parents neglect, abuse, or hair color, or we blame our rough
times in high school, acne, not getting that part in the school play we
practiced for for hours, OR we blame a game like D&D or EQ.  If we actually
realized that it is our OWN choices that cause the events in our lives then
we might have to actually change and well....dayum but that would be too
hard.  I suggest you get with the program and join the rest of us Americans
in finding scapegoats for our problems rather than taking personal
responsibility.  Sheesh!
