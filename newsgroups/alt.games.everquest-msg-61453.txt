While this may indeed be true (although some recent experience tells
me otherwise) it still makes neither proposition cheap... a decent MB
these days still runs well over $100us, the Athlon is still in that
range, and for giggles, we will say $50 for the ram... $250 may be
chump change to some, but just to play a game?  And then there is the
$200-$400 for the GF3 series of cards, which, to date, there are still
no products designed to use all the features of... up until very
recently, I was using a Voodoo4 card in my system, with more than
satisfactory results.  Only due to an excellent deal did I upgrade to
my current card (GF2 GTS Pro) and that was because I bought it at a
police auction.

I know several people that have computers in the 5-600mhz range (all
Celerons) that have mb's that require ram in pairs still... chips
which are 3-4 times more expensive than SDram per... their only option
that would be cost effective would be a new machine... which isn't
realistic to expect.

Point agreed, but not for the same reasons... nVidia is just as guilty
of the driver of the day as ATI is... often times with an older set of
drivers being faster or more stable than a newer one.  And AMD/Via
chipsets aren't exactly known for being bug free either.  

Personally, I have a little home brewed system with a Duron 750, 320mb
ram, a gForce2 GTS Pro (the 64mb ddr model) with a SB PCI512 (poor
mans SBLive board)... if SoL runs like crap on it, then I will either
turn the models off until it goes back to optimum, or not use the
expansion for anything more than the added spells and items.  Not top
of the line, by any stretch, but more than stable, and, by any
reasonable account, should be more than capable.

My only hope is that Verant does a MUCH better job of implementing
this new engine than Origin/EA did when they intro'd their new one for
UO.  If not, they could leave a bitter taste in the mouths of a lot of
people.
