Do you realize that when I was in elementary school, "Fuck" and "shit"
weren't even listed in the major dictionaries? "Ain't" is a fairly
recent listing. I'm quite sure no dictionary (at least, no mainstream
one) has listings for words like "homey" or the common slang
definitions of "hood" and "crib". However, most people recognize what
the terms refer to when used in the slang sense. AND they're all
rather commonly used in that way.

Whether or not a dictionary actually lists a particular meaning or use
of a word is completely irrelevant.
