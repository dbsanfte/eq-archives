Heh, you think you're some sort of hard-ass because you're good at a video
game? If you think you're something special, you're pretty fucked in the
head.

Haha... the way you represent yourself right now, I'm forced to believe
you're some loser that cries himself to sleep because you know you'll be
alone for the rest of your miserable life.

If you honestly think the things you do in a game mean a damn thing, you're
delusional. You're not impressing anyone.

toaster?
