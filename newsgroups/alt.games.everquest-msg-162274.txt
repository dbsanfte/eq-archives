This assumes that you will be playing with your son for some
Father/Son quality time.

I bought the 1st three packages: Original, Kunark, and Velious for
$30, which includes a month of free play.  It also included a std
hokey runesy map and an intro book.

One key point is that you will likely need to upgrade your machine, as
EQ likes 1/2 Gbyte of memory.  I bought a 512 Mbyte stick for $85,
giving me 640 Mbtye with Windows 2000 Server (I run some Oracle Server
apps too - not concurrent - heeheehee), and it runs O.K. now.
