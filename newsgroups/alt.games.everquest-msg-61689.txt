My mistake, I did of course mean, 'with *more* than 512Mb' - having 
*exactly* 512Mb shouldn't cause any problems, apparently. I should know 
that really, I had that trouble when upgrading from 512Mb to 768Mb and gave 
up and stuck the extra RAM in another machine until I found out what the 
problem was...
