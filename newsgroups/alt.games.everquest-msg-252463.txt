Of course not, but, they should not make a police report if someone
steals their crack. If someone murders them I would insist the police
track the perpetrators down.

They should not expect much help to keep the business going. They have
rights, if they were stolen from then they should be arrested along
with the theves. This wasn't a theft, per se, because they didn't have
ownership in the first place.
