I would expect it's a great aid for pulling when the puller is high
enough to not get chain agro while still being subject to proximity
agro.  I've pulled from the "tower" in LGuk with my 53 paladin by
positioning myself out of proximity agro range and casting Holy Might
(6 second stun) followed by IVU and then running to the pull spot
thru a fairly large number of mobs that would agro me if I weren't
invis.  The SK or Necro using the pre-nerf circlet wouldn't need the
long stun to get their invis off, just pull with spell/arrow and
click/run (obviously the circlet would be used in a different zone).
Plus with the ability to click on the run they would be able to recast
if they got an immediate Invis starts to wear-off.  Sounds like a
helluva deal to me anytime you have a long pull thru non-see-invis
mobs (again assuming high enough to not get chain-agro).


Kaev <-- loves to pull, wishes there were more zones he could do it
