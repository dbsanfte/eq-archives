Had a cleric in our guild do this.  He was bitching in group about how he
was bugged and his spec never went above 50.  Turned out he had forgotten
to train Divination and Conjuration.

The funny thing is that when he trained them, they BOTH got set to skill 60,
and he had to do the reset quest.  Made us wonder what would happen if you
waited until level 51 to train specialize.
