Long way to go!

You have to divide the freeport as two section: North Freeport where is the
bank, and West and South Freeport.

First kill as many Orc in commons. It do improve the north section faction.
Collect the DF belts from the dead orc.
When you have about 6-7 backpack full of DF belts, find a L39+ druid near
freeport. Ask him to cast  a wolfform on you, and you do the milita side DF
belt quest. It improve West & South, but make the North worst.
Continue killing orc until all section like you.
