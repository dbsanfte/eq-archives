I roleplay, i do it on Xegony, I'm proud of it, but one thing is right,
these uber shitheads need help... I roleplay becaue that is how i play the
game, now just the last week i went up with to Justice with another
guildmate, a 53 ShadowKnight and myself,  a lil 51 Knight to just see if we
could find something small to join or whatever, we had tried Inno, Disease
we weren't even going to touch, and Nightmare, all to no avail, so we hop on
over to Justice...
/ooc 53rd and 51st seasoned Knights looking for work.
mind you we aren't looking for a group for the Trials...
"xxxx ooc "go back to Seb you n00bs, PoP is 55+ if you couldn't read
instructions"
ensues us getting flamed for coming to the planes and even basically buying
the damn expansion... Here's some background info on my Knight and my
guildmates, we don't lvl like everyone else and take our times, we have both
tanked in Umbral, Grey, and even in a few of the planes, mainly Nightmare
and/or Inno for my guildmate...but she has more experiance pulling in 55+
zones then I... but still, we got our asses reamed because we weren't
"60-65" and actually in part because we rped... funny though to see a few
days later one of the people that ridiculed us lost 60 just as fast as he
got it...only to get it more times over the week and lose it just as
quickly. <smiles> the irony.
