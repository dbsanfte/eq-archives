You did nothing wrong.  If he didn't check then it's his problem.  If the
guy couldn't understand a mistake from a new potion maker then he was just
being an idiot himself.  Relax about it and, if something like that happens
again, do NOT give them back the full set of stuff.  Difference only...
that would have been 270pp (10pp per potion) and if the guy rails on you and
shouts to the zone, you could do it back and let the zone know what
happened.  That makes him look dumb.

Don't keep it up in ooc or shout though.  Personal things should be kept
between parties but, being accused of being a thief on such things is rather
serious.  Some folks track thieves and will not allow them in groups or will
warn others about them so letting the zone know what happened is worth
while.  (besides, most folks in the zone would probably slam the idiot for
not checking and tell him mistakes like that happen when folks get new
skills...).

Never be intimidated if someone threatens to report you in such situations.
You did nothing wrong and were totaly honest in your dealings.  His reaction
was extreme and uncalled for and any GM would see what happened as his fault
and your willingness to correct it as more than generous.

Ciao for now
