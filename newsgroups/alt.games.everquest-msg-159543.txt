A friend of mine with a 61 paladin is "quitting EQ"... or at
least taking a long break.  He's interested in giving me his
account; not to sell or strip... heck, he even admits he might
change his mind and come back.  His hope is I'll enjoy playing
his character as an alt, get to do some things my main really
can't (although I pretend he can) and basically keep the
character afloat for a while, so if he does decide to come back
in a few months, the account will still be there.

Well, there we go, calling my bluff.  I've alway said I wanted to
be a paladin but found the cleric side of life too hard to give
up.  Now I can have both.

Problem is, do I want to?  I'll be a piss poor pally, frankly,
perhaps better than 90% of the clerics out there, but thats not
saying much.  I've never played a melee class past 20 or so, I
wouldn't know a discipline if it bit me, and my melee skills are
limited to slapping the autoattack button while soloing, or using
/assist and slapping the autoattack button while grouped.
Getting aggro on purpose and then holding it is something I've
done rarely and at substantial effort... finding a mob thats
beating on someone it shouldn't be and deciding what to do about
it.. well, I'm thinking people are going to die that shouldn't.

Further, whatever the paladin does isn't going to further the
interests of my characters.  In fact, just as with me playing
alts, they are going to cut into the time and experience and loot
my main gets, since I'd be playing pally instead of "me".

Course I could figure out how to dual box the pally with my
cleric, which would enable me to "solo" a lot faster than cleric
alone...

Hmm, just don't know what to say.
