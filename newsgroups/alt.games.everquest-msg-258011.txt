This is pretty true.   The first book is very Tolkienesque...  some say
worse, I personally think it was done better.  (Of course, I don't think
it's very hard to do better than LOTR...)   From the second book on though,
the similarity goes away.   Jordan said it was intentional, that he wanted
to give new readers familiar territory to start off on.   *shrug*

I wouldn't recommend the series at the moment though, as a whole.  While the
first six are worth the price, they don't come to a satisfying stopping
point in themelseves, (1) and the later ones have not been nearly as high
quality.   Perhaps I'll go back to recommending it if it makes a comeback,
perhaps not.

(1) Unlike something such as Babylon 5, where the first 4 seasons are
great... and you can kind of ignore that there was a fifth season ever made,
since _Deconstruction of Falling Stars_ makes such a great final episode.
