At your level there is no hat you could quest for.

Frankly the hat-situation for casters in general is pretty dire as far as
appearance. The only one that shows is the low level runed circlet. All the
decent stuff (eg runed cowl, crown of king trannix) is treated as cloth (a
cloth crown ?) and doesn't show.

No crown graphics (despite all the crown items) and no point hats etc.
