Has anybody else noticed LDoN mobs having unusually good resists
vs. stuns, roots, and snares?  Maybe mezzes too, hard to say for
sure but it looks like Enchanters I've grouped with are having
some trouble landing mez as well.

I've never seen so many stuns resisted outside of Kedge Keep!
Even Tashed mobs seem to resist my stuns fairly often.  At the
same time, I have not had Pacify resisted in LDoN yet.  But
the stuns man, the stuns...  really makes life as a Paladin
frustrating.  And when I tried a dungeon with my 28 Ranger he
had over half of his snares resisted.  Not used to seeing blue
cons resist anywhere near that much.  Oh well, at least they
aren't immune.
