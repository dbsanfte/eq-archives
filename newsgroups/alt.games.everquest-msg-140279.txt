Basic rule of thumb you can use to ballpark it seems to be as follows:

Level/10 * INT

So at level 50, you'll get five mana per INT. There used to be a soft
cap at 200 INT resulting in far less mana for any INT over 200, but
that's apparently been removed.

Depending on your level, that's probably a fine mask. 25 plat's a fine
price as well.

I paid quite a bit more for my current face slot item. (Mushroom Veil)
