The preceding statement is incorrect.  

Off-hand is a straight ratio.  A 30/60, 20/40, 15/30, 10/20, and 5/10 
weapon will all yield EXACTLY THE SAME DAMAGE in the off-hand.  There is 
no damage bonus on off-hand, so unless you're working to get your 
duel-wield skill up, there is NO reason whatsoever to not have a slow 
off-hander.  
You get a damage bonus applied to EVERY hit with your primary hand, so you 
want your primary hand to be the fast weapon.  Fast is even better than 
ratio for primary hand.  Remember the moss-covered twig, completely 
overpowered melee weapon, guess what the stats were, 3/10, a weak ratio 
but with the damage bonus a level 60 with max haste was basically hitting 
for 12-20 EVERY .4 seconds.  As an off-hand weapon, it's pretty damn 
crappy.  
To sum up, fastest in primary, best ratio in secondary.

Arolpin
using 10/18 primary, 16/26 off-hand
