Neville the Unlamented, my long deleted Wizard, didn't even notice the
guard who hangs out at the water's edge by the FelwitheB zone until the
day I tried to figure out what his PBAoE spell did.

Rambling and perhaps uninteresting story follows, read at your own risk:

I quit playing Neville in part because the lowbies of the day were, hmm,
odd.  This was towards the end of the early-game AoE "controversy", when
many folk claimed the AoE spells were useless and Wizards ought to get
new spells to replace them.  In those days a Wizard who used AoE spells
was considered by many to be either a loony or a masochistic griefer
(pretty much the way a Magician who used a pet in a dungeon was viewed).
There were some players who claimed successful use of AoE spells, and I
decided that I wanted to try a Wizard after one usenet exchange in which
one "uber" player claimed that Wizards were worthless in a group and his
"proof" was that it wasn't possible to do "disco" in Sebilis with a
Wizard in your group because you wouldn't be strong enough, to which one
of the AoE advocates replied that disco was easies with at least two
Wizards in the group, saying that he and his friends had broken disco
with multiple Wizards in the group (forget how many) and held it for
hours.  The usenet debate kind of died out after that, but I resolved to
try a Wizard because nuking multiple mobs sounded fun.  I, however, ran
into all sorts of ignorant resistance from other folks when I used the
cheesy L8 Column of Xx AoE, in spite of the success it led to.  This
seemed off the wall to me, I mean why in hell would grouping L8s be
worried about "efficiency"?  If you care that much go solo when you're
such an extreme lowbie ferpetessake!  Anyhow, as the novelty of nuke
kiting scarabs (gogogo slow mobs, heh) had worn off (this was my first
caster) I quit playing him and eventually deleted him.
