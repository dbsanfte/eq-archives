I am afraid I must humbly disagree with a whole hearted BULLSHIT!

You can not get a level every couple of days post 50 no matter how good you
are, unless you are a speed addict willing to play 24/7.

At BEST, a 52 druid quadding TD Raptors (not an easy task at 52 - bring your
ES Vambs), can get a blue every 3 mana bars. That is every 40-60 minutes.
*IF* everything goes well (no deaths, no adds, camp always open, etc) you
may be able to average 1 blue an hour. This is NOT playing, it is work. If
you play 3 hours a day, that's nine days through level 52, which is MUCH
faster than 53, which is MUCH MUCH faster than 54. Trying to power yourself
through this will make you a VERY sick person.

For the record, it took me 8 real life weeks to get through 52, with 80/20
level/AA split.
