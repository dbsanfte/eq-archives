In reverse order...
I have lost count of the times I've had a mob hitting me and my damage
shield without me hitting back and getting an offense raise from the
damage done by my thorns. I sure as hell didn't get offense 190 from
melee alone.

And I know not using a damage shield of any sort, including my skin,
IS a silly thing, something akin to tradeskill people who never do
anything without having their recipe book open. I obviously did get
defense raises with it, since my defense WAS 164. However, I didn't
get a single raise between levels 37 and 40, and now, after 4 nights
of no damage shield and doing my usual grouping thing, I've gotten 6
raises. I'm just glad my silly jinx actually is 'working' :)
