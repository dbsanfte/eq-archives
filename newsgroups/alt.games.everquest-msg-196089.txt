...and easier. It only stands to reason.

Nope. That first monster is easy. That second monster just as easy. That 
third one requires some aggro and mana management. That fourth one is 
just plain risky. If this changes to a situation where the same level of 
aggro and mana management required for the third one before isn't 
necessary until the fifth on or so with KEI, then instead of 50% of your 
kills being easy, now 60% of them are. Spin it how you want, but that 
pretty much = easier in my book.

> Sitting on your butt = easier

No argument there. Of course not playing at all would be easier still, 
but that's getting ridiculous now, isn't it? We're talking about the 
actual fighting here.

> Cant stand it when things change = old fogey

Bullshit. Having to be kept busy every minute of every hour spent during 
recreation = my kids when they were pre-school age. It doesn't have to be 
faster to be better. It's not the destination, it's getting there that 
matters. Why circumvent it?

Insisting on having it bigger, flashier, faster, *easier* = short 
attention span. May I suggest EQOA?
