I started a halfling warrior (I know lowest xp requirement) and decided
to see how quick he could level. I did not twink infact I only upgraded
my equipment once. I made level 5 in under 2 hours, and in terms of
hunting time it was more like an hour. And I was far from optimal.


Character name: Follon
Level 5 Halfling Warrior
Currently in Rivervale
Birthdate: Wed Mar 20 21:38:47 2002

Here is what I did.
Handed in my note and got my noob shirt.
Went out and hunted.

Level one - 7 mins
5 kills + the newbie note 
(bats, black wolves and giant rats) all even conning

Level two - 16 mins
18 kills
As above plus beetles snakes spiders and gobo workers.
(all inside the wall)
Some even conning mostly blue

Level three - 46 mins
32 kills
I messed about here for quite a bit.
I tried to find even cons out passed the wall.
This was a bad move.
Eventually I found that fighting just inside the wall there were enough
dark blues for me. Mostly beetles etc. Oh I also bought a rusty broad
sword (my only equipment upgrade). Finally I was AFK for about 2 mins.
Once I worked out what to hunt the level went much faster.

Level four - 43 mins
19 kills (!)
I was now fighting out side the wall killing large bats and black bears.
I did take one yellow con, but mostly dark blue with a few even cons.
Again I could have done this level much quicker. After some frustration
I went and dumped 12 points in to 1hs and then leveled quickly. Remember
that I am still weilding a rusty broad sword and wearing only a noob
tunic. I also "wasted" some time buying a bag.

I think if I was to try this again that I could make level 5 in well
under an hour un twinked. Twinked I think that ir would take about 45
mins. I dont even want to think how quick you could do it with a damage
sheild :-P

I want to see if I can get this char to level 10 by 5 hours played
(still wearing only my noob shirt)

By the way my skills at the end of this are :

1HS  = 23 (Trained 12)
Off  = 19
Def  = 11
Kick =  7
Sens =  4
Taunt=  1 (I only trained after dinging 5 <G>) 

Oh and I own one rusty broad sword, one newb shirt, 18 noob rations, 18
noob water and a small bag. I have just over 1 gp in cash. (Mind you I
have not been selling everything)
