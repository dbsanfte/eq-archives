As a side note, it seems they've managed to make quest mobs immune to
detrimental spells lately. I noticed a shipwrecked troll in Nadox who I
couldn't cast on, on conning him I found him indifferent and he
responded to hails by asking me to find him some papers to get him out
of there. I didn't try meleeing him but the game would not let me cast a
detrimental spell on him.
