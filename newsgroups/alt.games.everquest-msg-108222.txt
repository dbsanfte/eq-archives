<asbestos>
Nobody really cares about top/bottom posting. There have been mucho
flame wars about it. It annoy's me to see someones posts change, more
than top posting annoys me, because someone decided to "FIX" a top
post.

It is getting as bad as the Warhammer group, where someone decided on
an arcane system of writing subject lines.

We got better things to flame about!

Now I got a piece stuck in my lungs! cough cough. 
Can anyone spare mana for a heal?
