I'm awful in the know-your-equipment game (my downfall as a rogue!).  I'll
have to find a friend in EC to keep an eye on this for me.  I've been trying
to ask around about it since I'm already looking to move up from my Crys
Spear (13/30).  I'll ask around, hopefully it's camped as thoroughly on
Druzzil Ro, too.
