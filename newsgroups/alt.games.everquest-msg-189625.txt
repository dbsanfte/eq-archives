I did the wine quest with my iksar after I had improved my de merchant
faction by giving lightstones and greater lightstones to Smith Tv'Ysa
in South Ro.  I used invis potions to get me into the library in the
3rd gate and had a full set of backpack with as much wine as I could
carry.  It took two trips but my iksar is amiable to the outer guard
now.   The inner guard is the hardest.  I think i'm only dubious still
to them.  I still have to avoid some of the guild mobs like X'ta Tempi
and her sisters but i can use the bank!  And didn't have to kill any
halflings.  So with all the orc I've killed, i can now even go through
Rivervale again with avoiding some of the mobs.
