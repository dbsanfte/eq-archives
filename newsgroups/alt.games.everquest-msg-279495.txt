Well,some time ago,I would have agreed with your statement about 
Berserkers,their AAs beyond the level 59 ones werent even in game
when the class went live and even not finished when a Berserker friend
of mine ran out of AAs,he could spend points on efficiently,some
months later.(I spare me every comment on this,we are not talking
about unfinished content here :p).

But nowadays they do not seem to be that rare,of course there are
much more Beastlords around. :p
In pickupgroups they are as common as one of the other less played
classes like,hm lets say,Mages,Monks or Shamans(Shamans!  :p).

In a recent DoN I did with a pickupgroup we had a 70 Berserker,I have
all melee hits turned off,all other combat spam,magic and crits,goes
in one window,messages usually scroll through so fast,that it is hard
to follow,sometimes making it difficult to read important stuff like
"Quarm begins to cast the gating spell" :p.
The messages produced by the criticals of the Berserker looked like
this:

Berserker scores a critical hit for 1031 damage 
Berserker scores a critical hit for  978 damage
Berserker scores a critical hit for  867 damage
Berserker scores a critical hit for  665 damage
Berserker scores a critical hit for  978 damage
Berserker scores a critical hit for 1019 damage

This came up every 6 seconds,with no interruption by other
combat messages.

Unremarkable?
