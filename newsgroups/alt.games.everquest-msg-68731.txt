Up until the patch a couple of days ago, ctrl-alt-del worked just fine on my WinXP system to allow me to toggle into and out of EQ.  Now, I
get a message that EQ has detected an error and needs to close.  Does anyone know if this ability is officially nerfed?  If so, then this
EQW program might be just the thing I need.

Any ideas?
