This isn't some challenge but merely busywork.  I'd still make the run to FV
once the plat starts weighing me down and/or to put into storage some item I
might want to sell or give to another player or some future character I
might create.

Saying you have a druid in your group (normally I don't at the FM fort) this
imposes on them to be your taxi service.  They have to first go and bind
there then cart your and likely all the other members of your group there
and back.

Do you play a cleric?  I'm not some tank that gets the plat in the loot
because I loot as soon as the mob drops and while the casters meditate.
Also being a cleric, I not only have to buy spells but also armor.  Selling
to the vendor in LOIO in the elaborate buying exchange as others have
suggested is stupid.  Good idea until merchants do coin exchanges but stupid
gameplay wise.  More busywork.  Doesn't add to the enjoyment of the game but
merely manipulates it to overcome the problem of the merchants not doing
coin exchange.

I'm trying to get a Forest Loop and they drop off the giants in FM's fort.
