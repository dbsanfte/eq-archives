Well that would be lots of fun, and since the necro healing takes
the HP from me it sounds like a bad idea, i have helped a lower
lever girl that had been attacked by a black bear, healed her
until she killed the bear then she ran away and i was moments later
ambushed by a yk, with at starting health of about 50% and low mana
that was no fun :( 

If the guy was a friend then maybe i would help him but not a complete
stranger..
