Well if it was humorous, why the hell didn't you all laugh!?!?! ;p

And ok, so basically you're just a bunch of trigger happy EQ freaks.
Got it. I'll remember that in the future, or not. Depends on the level

Well I've had many times I couldn't connect. Just never a time where
I'm dumped, can't log in under any of my accounts, can't get on the
website, but everything else is working fine on internet/email/usenet.
