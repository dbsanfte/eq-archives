If you know a Rogue, you can have him use his Sneak/Hide skills to drag your
corpse up for you.  Doesn't have to be high level.  You'll just need to do
the /consent command to allow him to drag the corpse up for you.
(If the rogue's name was Soandso, then you'd type "/consent Soandso"
[without the quotation marks] to give him permission to drag your corpse.)

If you don't know a rogue to do the job for you, I suppose you could create
a Halfling Rogue and do it yourself (Halflings start out with a decent
Sneak/Hide skill, so you won't have to level him..or at least not much.)
You'll just have to have your Necro character /consent your Rogue character
before he does the job.  Just remember to make sure your sneak and hide
skills are active at the same time.
