I used to check out Gunthak a few times each lvl since 35 with my Pally 
to see if I could make any progress there. Also because I would get 
pissed off waiting in DL to join a group that usually had no structure 
or brains. I couldn't really succeed in Gunthak until lvl 40. I went 
from 40 to 45 with about have my exp coming from soloing there. I was 
half way through 45 when the hot spot patch came out, and the exp has 
really gone up a lot. Right now I am 48, and I still get 1/3 blue from, 
now rare, DB mobs on the beach. Now I am working in Dulak mostly trying 
to get a medallion. 
    	Anyway, Gunthak and Dulak are very good places for mid 30's 
groups. Im not sure when other classes could solo but I could at 40 with 
Instrument of nife, ward undead, and a Deepwater Helmet to cut down on 
healing costs.  It is an excellent place for Pally's and Clerics, but it 
is getting a bit crowded at times now.

    main:	Midur-48-Human-Paladin- Mith.Marr
    	    	40-48=Gunthak
    	    	30-40=Unrest, DL, Lower Guk
    	    	25-30=Unrest
    	    	20-25=Paludal
    	    	15-20=WC
    	    	10-15=Befallen
    	    	1-10=FP, EC

Played for 3 months with PoP version, stopped playing for 3 months but 
kept account open so i could play it when i went to college, played for 
2 months 1st semester, never really got into it and closed account at 
lvl 18, reactivated this Jan. with no items, bought EQ Evo so i could go 
to the famous PC, with that my I finally developed a real intrest in the 
game.  I might only be lvl 48, but I have spent a lot of time learning 
and understanding the game and how to play my part as a Pally.
