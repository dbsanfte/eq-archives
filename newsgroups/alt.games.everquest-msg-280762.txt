Yeah, I'm another one of those wierdos that actually liked the ships.

As for quests, they should not make them trivial to do, but, they should 
make them possible to do with out total blind experimenting which is 
often required for quests in EQ.  I don't want them to go as far as the 
quest journal in EQ2 where it walks you through the quests.  I would not 
mind them adding a quest journal that tracks what quests you have done, 
what ones you are doing, and what you have completed for those you are 
doing, as well as what the NPCs said to you for those quests.  They do 
have the journal in EQ, but it is a royal pain in the butt to find 
anything in it to say the least.  I would love to see them fix known 
broken quests, and fix quests that are just unsolvable based on the 
information provided in game to make them solvable.

You mean add more Ldon instances?  LDON is already suitable for all 
levels from 20ish up to 70.

I would love to see more of this, but, I want them to actually allow 
players to influence the outcomes instead of just doing a preset 
storyline with a preset result.

Unfortunately, what I expect from SoE is just more of the same.  The sad 
thing is, of the games I've tried, it is still the best one out there for 
me.
