Hi...  Since the patch for "9" I have noticed some additional lag,
especially in zones like PoK and Bazaar but nothing especially bothersome.
I'm not running a state of the art system...  1MHz with 640K and Readon 8000
series card via cable.  What I have noticed that IS quite bothersome is in
most zones while running across flat areas the ground "weavers".  Hard to
describe it any other way but a section of ground will shimmer back and
forth as I approch it.  Also I now seem to get stuck on trees quite often
(I'm use to autorunning across zones and just skimming tress).  Anyone else
notice these two things or is it just a function of my system configuration?
Since everything seems to work pretty well I'd hate to go to an updated
video driver and suddenly start having lots of "big" problems.

Good luck and be safe...
