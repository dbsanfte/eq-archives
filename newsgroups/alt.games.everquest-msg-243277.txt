Having played a druid as a main right to the endgame (of the time), I
can tell you how many times I used Bonds of Tunare: exactly once, in
the BotB group tourney. It snared all the other team's pets and was
resisted by every player....

Other than that, always Ensnare, which is gruesomely superior to the
wizard spells and is in fact one of the single best spells in the
whole game.
