Haven't looked at them since focus was added, that would make a
difference I suppose.  Personally, I want Wis and/or Mana on almost every
piece of gear I own, along with as good an AC as I can find... and
HP too, but I didn't get a lot of that till over 50.

Trouble with the Sol Ro quest set (and with most quest sets) is that it
gives you a boost to all your stats... yet most stats are useless to most
characters.  If there -is- a stat that is useful to you, then you want lots
and lots of it... a well rounded character is actually one woefully lacking
in the one or two stats that matter to his class and strategy.
