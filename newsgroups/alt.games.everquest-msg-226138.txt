Doesn't matter for me - I do not plan on staying on test, I just plan on
road testing a chanter verses a wizard. At the end of the day I cannot
imagine whether you testbuff or not would mean much compared to like say:

I have gotten into nice folk guilds in the past on the Chimp being up front
and letting them know I was a Ebay character at 54.
