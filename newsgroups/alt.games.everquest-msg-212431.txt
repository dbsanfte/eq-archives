It drops him back to the log-in screen. Its not a consistent problem, after 
checking through a few things, I got logged-in. I thought he was in the next 
room but he went off to sulk and I ended up getting one of his characters 
killed. I don't play EQ, I don't know the first thing about it.

Personally, I don't thnk it'll make much difference if he goes back to Win98. 
I'm more inclined to think its a problem with the cable lines or with the 
network cable I've got run up into his room.

I just wanted to see if the problem was as extensive as he claimed. He said 
there were several people playing that had problems with XP and this 'last 
patch.' If it was, then another patch would be coming post haste.

I'd like to thank other people for their comments. Its all food for thought. 
There haven't been many changes on his computer and EQ seems to be the only 
thing giving him problems.
