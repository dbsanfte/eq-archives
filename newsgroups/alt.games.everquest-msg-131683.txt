Of course not.  But once you max out the useful ones, why not?

You seem to be implying that the first two points are not a waste? ; )

It only works if the thing is already in death march mode.... so not a lot of
point in getting a small chance to kill it early.  It already wasn't going to
do more damage to you.

But oh what fun would it be...  Really big two hander, really fast hitting
mob, double riposte and /disipline furious...  (Riposte all hits for 10
seconds)

Bandage wound increases the amount that each bandage heals by 10, 25 and 50
percent.

On this, I absolutely have to disagree.   I have the warrior velious
breastplate.  It is damn near useless as a downtime reducer.   Completely
useless if you have the first aid AA from the general section.   My bandages
take about 8 or 10 seconds to use (?) and heal 90 points per bandage.   My
velious brestplate has a right click heal that heals 90 points, but takes 14.5
seconds to cast.   That is before Bandage wounds.   After, I would be healing
135 in 8 or 10 seconds.

Although, neither one is all that useful unless you plan on soloing your
warrior a lot.  (I know, try not to hurt yourself laughing at the thought ;) )

For my warrior, it's 135 to get everything I sort of want.   113 or so to get
the ones that I do want.
