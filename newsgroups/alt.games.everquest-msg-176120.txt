Sorry, no.  A warrior will outdamage an equivalent level (and equipped) SK
or Paladin.  (with the one exception of a Slay Undead 3 paladin fighting
undead).   Clerics don't even come close.

Ogres have an obscene advantage in the "no stun from the front" ability.
Although that is finally being mitigated somewhat by the Stalwart Endurance
AA.

Every other race is more or less equal.   At high levels the slight racial
regen of Iksar or Trolls is meaningless, as is the Iksar AC bonus. And with
good gear you can max out any race on stamina.
