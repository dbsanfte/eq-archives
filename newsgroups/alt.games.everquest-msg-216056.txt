I got through the 20's fine with root and nuke.  No twinkage.

If root broke, my recollection is that I'd use a stun to stop the mob while
I rerooted.  I'd shadow step and gate if things went downhill.  If root was
resisted, strafe run to get some distance and try again.  I recall running
many a goblin or sarnak or skeleton from south of Ill Omen halfway to FM to
get enough distance. :-)

I got some twinkage at around 54, when a friend in an uber guild (Legacy of
Steel) retired, and gave me the droppable gear he'd twinked his level 20
Wizard with.  Before that, I'd had help on two or three quests.  A friend
helped on one of the kills for the SoTF quest.  He and his guild helped on
the Staff of the Wheel quest piece in LGuk.  Oh, I went with them once and
they got my GEBs, when I was about 10 levels lower than normal for that
camp.

It took me about 76 days /played to get to 60.  Not as fast as some, but not
too bad, either.

I would recommend a race that gets Hide.  That makes life a hell of a lot
nicer at low levels (although when I was low level, medding meant staring at
a full-screen spellbook...it's not as critical now to be able to hide)
(although being able to safely go AFK helps a lot with a solo Wizard).
