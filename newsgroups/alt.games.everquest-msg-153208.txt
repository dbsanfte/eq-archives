Take your head out of the sand and try it. VERY GOOD reason? Unless your
video capture run to the absolute limits of your system, EQ can quite
happily plod along in the background. Look at the floor, spam a few

I didn't answer the question in the title. I answered the question you
were ACTUALLY asking.

You could run your computer through a timed plug, which would turn off
the computer (and hence shut down EQ) at a specific time. That answers
your title question, but is that answer of any use to you in obtaining
your end result?

You made false assumptions based on lack of knowledge. You assumed you
have to shut down EQ. Using EQW removes that necessity, therefore
achieves the end result.

BTW, you're welcome.
