ok, lets clear something up, i spent 3 levels off and on huinting HG's in
rathe, not really for the cash as i was also there for xp

at 44th, i am just starting to fight things that drop "good" plat, IG's in
everfrost being the one atm, and still i hunt them for essence of winter not
the plat

next, i don't and never have considered a 1plat item to be good loot, you
may - good for you

on the other the suggestion to hunt wisps for GLS is the probably the best
he will see plat-wise for about 20 more levels

and anyone with any clue smacks bears for pelts   :)
