Bards can mezz as well as enchanters, since at 60 AE mezz isn't going
to cut it.  Bards can hit AE slow which lowers mob damage output and
pulls aggro to the bard.  Bards have enough AC and HP to actually get
beat on for a round or two.  Bards have Selos, and sometimes a hasty
retreat is the only answer.  Also, if the shit really hits the fan,
bards can do both crowd-control and a bit of tanking.
