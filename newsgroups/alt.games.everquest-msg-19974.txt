Actually, my Paladin has soloed more from 40-52 than he ever
managed to do from 10-40.

Get the best weapon you can afford, and a Deepwater Helmet (which I
don't think you can cast from until 45), and head to the Ocean of Tears.
Camp Gornit on the Seafury island, he's good exp, and good loot, and
has a fast respawn.  When he starts to green out to you, start working
the Seafury Cyclops themselves.  They'll beat you up more than Gornit,
but they also drop nice gems.  If you get bored, swim southeast
to the gargoyle/spectre island, and beat up Spectres for exp, and
Gargoyles for cash (each Gargoyle Eye sells for close to 10p, and
they stack, so you can lug a lot of them around).

There's nowhere to zone for safety, but if you get far enough
away from something in OOT, it gives up chasing you, so when
things get desperate, Root it and swim to a nearby island,
hoping you get enough distance before the Root wears off.
Then camp (to clear aggro, otherwise it'll jump you when
you go anywhere near it again), then start over.  Or just Root
and camp, hoping that your Root doesn't wear off in 30 seconds.
But with JBoots and Levitate (whenever you see a Mage in OOT,
buy some Levitation rings), you can simply outrun things by
running over the water.

Word to the wise -- don't mess with the dinosaur which often
hangs out on the island farther to the west.

When you need to bank/unload, the fastest thing to do is swim
south until your first coordinate reads -4650, then tread water
(or swim west) until you run into the boat heading to Freeport.
Swim into its nose and it'll scoop you up.  Since the Seafury
area is on the eastern end of OOT, that's a hell of a lot faster
than grabbing the boat at the Sister's island and riding it ALL
the way west to Butcherblock, then riding the boat ALL the way
back across the ocean to get back to the Seafuries.

That'll take you up to 50 or so.  Then you can solo Cyndreela, the
necro who guards the Fear portal in Feerrott.
