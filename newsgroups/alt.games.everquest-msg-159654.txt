Gnome enchanter.  That way you can do Tinkering, too.  The only skills you
won't have access to as a Gnome enchanter are Poisoning and Alchemy.  Also,
if you go agnostic, you will be non-KOS in more starting cities than any
other race.

You can kill them all day long.  There is no faction hit.

Depends on what you want to farm/solo.  For silks and hides and stuff, once
you get high enough, ANY class can do it.  For enchanters, just summon a pet
and let it thump on the spiders/bears/wolves/etc.

Enchanters can enchant metal for jewelry, summon mana vials for pottery,
tailoring, and whatnot.  They also get CHA buffs for good merchant prices,
and INT buffs for skill increases.  They get also illusions and self-only
faction buffs so that they can go more places safely, and trade with more
merchants.

The tertiary stats for some tradeskills only apply if they are higher than
INT/WIS.  Just go for INT and don't worry about the tertiary stats.
