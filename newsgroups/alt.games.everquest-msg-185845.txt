Got the Chardok Overking done last night, all I have left is an
exchange with Zordak Ragefire in Sol B and then the 2 SF Ragefire
kills.

I'm sitting here in Sol B, theoretically where he spawns, but can't
seem to find any concrete info regarding how often or when he show's
up.  And I have no clue when the last cleric came through for the
exchange.

Anybody know anything definite?  Is it really a 24 hour spawn?  Is it
triggered?  Any thoughts?
