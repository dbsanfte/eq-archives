Yep, which is why the first thing I said, which you quoted, suggested 
that EQ1: might be a better solution to the problem of telling which is 
which.

BUT

if someone is coming in here and doing google searches for information, 
he's looking at 5 years worth of EQ1 posts with no EQ1: headers.

If he's looking for EQ1 info, thats good, except that he's got to dig 
thru all the new EQ2 posts which aren't labled, so he can't sort them out.

And if he's looking for EQ2 info, he's got all that baggage hiding the 
few gems.

Putting EQ2: on all EQ2 posts seems like a better solution... 
particularly if, as some speculate, EQ2 is destined to be a flash in the 
pan, like COH or SWG, which each also put up quite a heavy load of posts 
for a while, but died off.  People seem pleased with EQ2 now, but will 
they still feel that way a couple months from now?  Hard to tell.
