Back in the day when I hunted low / medium pelts I got a plat or 2 for each
one.  I think I got 25 for a high quality bear skin - (it was a long time ago).
 My friendly neighborhhood shaman buyer would always throw in a SoW to make my
journey easier.  I miss those days.
*I* at no time thought those were inflated prices for trivial effort.  It was a
fair price for my hard work.  Before Paludal people actually got *experience*
tracking bears, wolfs and lions. :)))
