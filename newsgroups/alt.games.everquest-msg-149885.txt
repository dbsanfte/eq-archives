Eh, if you're the Vice President of the United States, ever gaff will be
recorded.  But I did word it wrong, I should have said "Gore isn't so
obviously stupid."

Dubya earned the "stupid" flag long before he had nearly the exposure.  Just
look at the the condition of Texas (I was going to say "state" instead of
"condition" but that'd confuse too many people <g> ).  Economy down the
tubes, oil giants running everything, executing people they shouldn't (I'm
pro-death penalty, but not militant about it).  Either stupid or corrupt,
and I prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt.
