I have noticed that with Grshnik the Destroyer... people often camp the
entire goblin city singlehandedly, and don't want anyone else to kill the
goblins there in case they kill grashnik; but the more goblins killed, the
more grashniks pop. I was pumelled by two of the Grashnikii once. Most
unpleasant!

Perhaps these guys just have large families?
