Pretty much everyone agrees that run speed is the way to go.  It works
indoors.

SoW and Selo's don't work indoors because having players run faster
than mobs would totally destroy the balance of dungeons, or something
like that.  I believe this was one of those "don't bug us about it
because it will never change" things, kind of like binding.
Apparently the high end game is so screwed up by mudflation, that
Verant has said "what the hell...might as well let people have fun".
