Sycophant.

I've been reading Bizbee's posts for several years now. He's nothing if
not predictable, and will give anyone or any concept he doesn't
particularly approve of the Bizbee Hairdryer Treatment; a droning,
laboured, lukewarm gust of air, easily harnessed to make yourself look
good.

Though I don't care much for his knee-jerk belligerence, from time to
time he does engage in cordial and helpful exchanges, and has thus
escaped my killfile. Although if I could set my filter up to block ego /
meta threads I'd be happy as Larry.
