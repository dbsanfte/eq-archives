An 'acceptable margin of error' is quite obviously a problem if the 
people are extremely disatisfied when the wrong people get elected, 
particularly to the position of president, as a result of it.

The systems are flawed and defective. The voting system has been flawed 
all along, now its just not 'approved' to be that flawed.

No. In order to blame/ and or sue the manufacturers you would have to 
prove they did not meet the certification requirements.

To prove the punch card voting system is faulty you merely have to prove 
that the margin of error is exceeding the actual margin of voters, and 
that error noise is actually overriding voter selection.

Most people in Kentucky don't give a rats ass who Alabama votes in due 
to a voting technology problem... and that's if it even makes the news 
in KY. It requires a spectacular failure on the scale of a presidential 
election to get the voters riled up about anything as mundane as the 
voting technology.

Pointing at the lack of national outrage over a technical screwup in one 
state is silly. The nation doesn't get outraged unless both a) its 
important enough that people actually care, and b) the media is busy 
whipping it into a frenzy.

Of course they are fundamentally flawed. The margin of error perverts 
election results. Thats a fundamental flaw of the the system. So what if 
most of the time it doesn't make a difference to the final result... 
that doesn't mean they aren't fundamentally flawed, it just means that 
historically they worked well enough most of the time at a low enough 
cost to avoid being tossed into a dump.
