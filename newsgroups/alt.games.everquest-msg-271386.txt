That's an arbitrary and false distinction.  Translating your example
into the realm of personal experience, you are claiming that a new
engineering graduate is not being taught when he is mentored on the
job by an experienced engineer after he is "sent out into the field".
I can assure you that it is simply not possible to make any statemnt
more false than that.

Armies that believe that have lost battles and wars with depressing
regularity throughout history.  Also, it's worth noting that you are
seriously oversimplifying the relationship between veteran and green
trooper with your rather contrived example.

To learn from experience requires that you survive the experience
and that you recognize at least part of what was done right and what
was done wrong.  Having a knowledgeable and experienced mentor right
there on the spot not only makes both of these more likely to be
true, but also makes it highly likely that the latter will involve a
much more complete understanding.

Look at how people learn, and don't make the mistake of equating
learning with books and controlled/contrived situations (which
you did in your first paragraph but avoided thereafter).  Well
trained armies sustain their excellence by mixing experience in
at a very low level.  Infantry fireteams and squads, for example,
aim for 4 - 10 soldiers per NCO depending on the army and the
circumstances under which units are being formed.  Elite units
are by no means strictly veteran except in rare cases.  Master
plumbers take apprentices on the job with them to learn, they
don't send them out on their own.  This same pattern repeats
itself anywhere and everywhere.

I had hoped to end up in a discussion of possible game mechanics
that could allow a more realistic grouping environment.  I would
like to believe that the "sorta like youth sports but we ban the
coaches from the arena" approach does not have such a powerful
vice-grip on people's emotions that it cripples their perception
and imagination.  I suppose the competitive attitude brought to
the community by the so many of the players has a lot to do with
that.

So many people obsess over the notion that "it's not right for
Joe Levelone to get any credit for anything that Jane Levelninety
has anything to do with".  And that whole idea is, to my mind,
wrong on multiple levels.  I am just astonished at how accepting
people are of the ass-backwards notion that Graeme Leveleighteen
will learn nothing by watching, emulating, and being criticized
by Bob Leveltwentyfive, yet meanwhile Bob Leveltwentyfive will
not have his learning impeded by the constant distraction of
mentoring Graeme.  Take a minute and think about it.  It's
completely asinine.

It doesn't help any, from my perspective, that this whole thing
appears to be deeply rooted in the sort of childish jealousy I am
constantly having to help my children abandon ("No fair!  I had
to kill every last Orc with my bare hands and teeth!  Uphill both
ways!  Plowing through 5-foot snowdrifts under the blazing desert
sun!" ... "What!  You had teeth!?!?!?").

You should be able to improve faster in the company of stronger
characters, not spectacularly faster (because it would be cruel
to make all but a randomly chosen few of the character population
progress as slowly as they ought to without mentors), but faster
none-the-less, _assuming_ that appropriate content is chosen.
Likewise, the mentor(s) in the group should suffer significantly
slowed progress (if they aren't making the effort to teach you're
not likely to get much educational benefit from the association).

Sure, many quests should look askance at ringers in the questing
group or ramp up the difficulty of the quest, "divine" tests
certainly ought to have that character to them.

Rather than remaining permanently hung-up on repressing power-
leveling, games ought to manage mixed level groups in a positive
and rewarding fashion just as they do with similar level groups.
Give the players useful choices to make, benefits and drawbacks
to balance.  Focus on fun, social interaction, and entertainment,
rather than dour pseudo-righteousness.  Repression is never any
fun for anybody except those who take a sad, cruel, satisfaction
in being prudes of one sort or another.

Any mixed level group should tend to become a similar level group
over time.  Current "wisdom", i.e. existing game mechanics, shows
what happens when selfish, envious, and ultimately non-sensical,
emotional reactions are allowed to dictate bad design decisions.
