It shouldn't matter if the equipment is as if it were soulbound. How
does that effect how much a character depends on it? Gear is gear.
Period. As far as food goes, as I said, I'm not counting it because
every class depends on it the same.

It's not a question of how easily a character can obtain gear, it's a
question of how much he relies on having gear, period. How it's
obtained never came into question. At least, the OP never stated that
in his original question. Everyone else apparently just assumed...
"Which class is least gear dependant", to me, is asking which class
can function best with an empty inventory.
