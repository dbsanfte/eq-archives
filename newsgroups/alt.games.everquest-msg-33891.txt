IMHO: Just means the programmers are kind of immature and elitist as in "I
don't have to follow the rules" and they snuck a few in. This is pretty
consistant with my experiences with programmers.

There are two levels of administration going on here, the programming crew
and the game administration. All this means is if some of the programmers
were admin'n the game, names like Harry Cock would be perfectly acceptible
to them. This should come as no surprise to anyone.

But the programmers aren't game admins.
