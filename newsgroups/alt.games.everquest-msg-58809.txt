    He's responding to the type of event. They've run these in several
zones, and this is roughly how the script goes:

    NPCs show up, saying they "want to play". Anyone who attacks them is
gacked while they protest how "they want to play". Anyone trying to
interract with them is gacked, or stymied as nothing they say or do seems to
register with the GM. So, um, what's the point? You don't roleplay, you die.
You roleplay, you either get ignored (lucky you) or die. If they actually
PLAYED, it would be amusing. But they don't, except perhaps with your head.

    James
