I had to laugh yesterday when our server GM *shouted* to the EW zone 
something like 'This is GM Drembo, can I have your attention please'

A guildmate thought it was some putz pretending to be a GM since it wasn't 
a broadcast or anything and he presumably didn't know the name of the GM. 
So he /oocs 'Bite me!'

... You have been summoned by the gods  :)

boy was he embarassed...
