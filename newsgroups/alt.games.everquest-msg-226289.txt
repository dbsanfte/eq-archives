What baffles me is that you think this guy was a good bard. A good
<insert class here> knows how to listen to his group and doesn't try
to force his way into leadership. It doesn't matter how good he is at
bard mezzing or pulling, if he's ignoring instructions from the group
as to who to let pull and call pulls, he's not a good bard. Period.
The fact that he endangered the group on what sounds like more than a
few occasions makes me wonder why you're so willing to take that risk
again. *shrug*
