At least on my server, I think part of the reason people who felt the
need to buy plat may have stopped is LDoN itself. First, LDoN dungeons
drop plat, something they'd moved away from in both Luclin and PoP.
Also, the people that formerly bought plat did so because the gear they
wanted was beyond their reach and they didn't have the time to join a
raiding guild to get the comparitively easier upgrades that way. LDoN
changes all this, as it puts decent gear within reach of the more casual
players with smaller blocks of time to play. Both the drops and the
points purchasable items appear within reach, at least until you start
adding up just how long it will take to purchase them. But, I think
psychologically, seeing an 1150 point item you want will seem much more
achievable than seeing items in the bazaar for 50k-250kpp. Especially in
the last year or so when good experience zones didnt even yeild much in
the way of plat at all.

As to population decreases, I can say with relative authority that my
server has approximately 8000 people on it above L20 who have purchased
and are playing LDoN. I know this because a few guildmates and I have
been foraging in ldon dungeons with druid alts while at raids the last
few days and our druids have 7 failures and 0 wins and rank in the 7900
range on the leaderboard.

About the only place I've seen noticable attrition is in a few elemental
guilds where friends are complaining about the turnout lately. Why, I
don't know, but I'd guess it had more to do with the number of elemental
plane guilds on my server raising past 4 recently, which means there's
now competition for spawns, rather than 1 plane per guild which formerly
meant if one plane was occupied, you could just raid one of the others.
