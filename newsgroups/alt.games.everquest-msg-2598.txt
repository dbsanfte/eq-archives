I do like the fact that I can turn off my Inspection so I don't accidentally
inspect people when I'm trying to do something else, I just wish they would
have made it so you can turn it off so other people can't inspect you if you
don't want them to.

I think I had about 4 people come up to me tonight while I was Med'ing and
inspect me and then I get "Can I see XXXX". Now the first couple times I try
to be nice and explain that I'm busy right now and don't have time but after
that I just get pissed and say "NO, Leave me alone"

So please people STOP doing this. If you want to know something about, lets
say my shield, just come up and politely say " My that's a nice looking
Shield you have there. Does it offer you much protection?". If you do
something of this nature chances are you'll have to tell me to shutup
because I'll tell you all about my Shield and how I came about getting it.
