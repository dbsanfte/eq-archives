Gold is about 29.99 now... have seen in best buy fer 19.99 at times
though (first 3 expansions included - classic, velious, kunark, and
plains of power)
There is also the 12 bucks a month but the first month is always free
:)

> what are your options?

LOL, big question there. I suggest looking at the newbee are of the
site listed below for any information you will ever need.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

> at what level do you really feel like you are enjoying your investment?

About at level 10 fer me because you can make decent money for gear
and can get all your newbee quest gear. It just gets more fun after
that but that is when you feel better about your player.

> how much time do you need to enjoy the game?

Depends on you. I can be happy playing 5 hours a week or 5 hours a day
:) Just depends... it is a game. Unlike others though you will not
reach the last level and say ok time to shove this is a box to gather
dust till I give it to a friend or sell it to a second hand store.

> what kind of system do i need?

> what characters are the best to play?

People will tell you many things but here is my 2 coppers (info based
on pre 30 level ranges since you just starting out).

Warrior - if you like to group alot and like to beat on stuff.
Ranger - same as warrior but you can solo a bit.
Paladin - same as warrior but can sub fer a healer and solo a bit.
Shadowknight - If you like pure carnage in melle. Alittle less on the
soloing to start off. (especially mid levels 30 ish)
Druid - LOL you can solo to 65 not to shabby in groups either.
Necromancer - Solo master good in groups too but they have a hard time
getting one. (have a 35 myself, mostly solo cuz no one wants necro)
Rogue - have never played them... never liked since had one in group
and pick pocketed all the cash.
Monk - Great pullers at 17+ with fake death skill. Don;t plan to be
the tank in alot of situations. Mild soloing at easly levels.
Cleric - If you like the idea of having people's lives in the palm of
your hand, this is the class man. Soloing? LOL, one of the worst fer
that early on.
Shammy - Buff city man - good healer to and mild soloing.
Berzerker - No clue have not gotten GoD yet.
Beastlord - Very cool soloing of yea, grouping of yea... good class I
love um.
Magician - nuke city and a pet best in groups but can solo
efficiently.
Wizard - can solo and group... incredable magic damage.

If i missed one I'm sure I'll get a fix added to this post.

> can you buy the basic everquest and be content?

Maybe but why not get gold? It costs ablut the same.
