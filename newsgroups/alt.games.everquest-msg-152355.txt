Oh really?  Fascinating.  And you have solo'd how many untwinked
Warriors and Rogues above L40?

Ok bud.  You try soloing an untwinked Warrior, Rogue, or even Paladin
in your 40s and lo 50s.  Come back and tell me how many zones you
find to fight in where you can actually gain experience.  And tell
me how you did this without bothering to think about what you're
doing.

Ah, you would be one of those genius casters who is capable of killing
slower partnered with a melee than solo.  I've met far too many of your
cousins.

Keep trying, you might get better with practice.
