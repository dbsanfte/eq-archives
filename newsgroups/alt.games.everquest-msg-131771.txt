Sword of the Morning (ca 2.5k on Tunare last I was watching) works
well for agro, tho if you want to be sure of it you've got to be
casting stuns yourself and just treat the proc as a mana saving
bonus (i.e. each proc is one less time you have to cast).  In fact,
when I don't want agro I can't use my SoM, get three or four procs
close together and it can take a warrior a long time to get agro
back.  Biggest problem with SoM is that, by today's standards, it
just doesn't do enough damage compared to 2handers (not even close
to my Argent Protector), so I don't use it unless my role is caster
interrupt.
