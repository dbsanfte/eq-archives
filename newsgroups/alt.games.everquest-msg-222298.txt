Some of each... sadly, though, finding 3 to 5 other people who
can -all- relax and have a good time isn't as easy, as at least
half the population is still driven by the need to succede or the
fear of failure.

I've gone on a mission with two bards as the only healing... and
finished well under time.  I've also gone on a mission with only
a ranger as healer, no mezzer, no splitter, we -knew- we were
going to fail but went for the fun of it anyway.  That time we
did fail, but we were right, it was tons of fun trying.

The flip side is I've been in groups where we literally couldn't
get things off the ground because people refused to go without a
cleric... not without a healer, we had a shaman... and we even
had a bard to both lull pull and CC.  But no cleric?  No way! 
Sad.

For the partially driven, all the missions I've seen so far have
had a 90 minute timer, and if you are too slow to make that
timer, there's an extra 30 minutes, if you finish in that time
you get partial credit.  Make a point of taking 6 person group on
normal difficulties, and in most cases you can finish in under an
hour... but you have up to twice that long; there's not really as
much pressure as you might think.

Saying that, though, assumes you adopt a play style that fits the
time limit; you do have to pull constantly, kill fast, keep
moving; you should expect to be "on" for the next hour or two,
its a more intense environment than a standard exp group where
half the people can slack off on one mob or another, take breaks
and so forth and only slow the rate at which exp and loot flows
in, with a timer there's a pass/fail aspect to it that means a
few minutes slacking off could add up to the difference between
making it or not.
