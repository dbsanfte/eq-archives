I'm switching to ADSL. Currently still having trouble with logging in
(provider is being an ass with activation), but once I have it setup it is
only connected to 1 computer. AFAIK I can only have one computer connected
through the modem so I want to use a proxy server. Does anyone have any good
experiences with any of the (free) winproxy servers?

My 'network' consists of 1 Win2k, 1WinME and 1 Win98 computer. The WinME
computer will have the connection and has a built-in hub which connects to
the other 2 pc's. I'm having some problems connecting the win2k to the
others although win2k does say it finds the network and games (UT, RA2) work
fine over it so I guess it's some lame-ass windows sharing problem.
In the worst case I can always switch the OS from WinME to win2k there.
