I think I already mentioned, as well, that I snapped at another person 
soon after because I was feeling so paranoid - what happened was, I saw 
<person> starts casting a spell - then I snapped off "I'm FINE thanks" 
and saw a "k" - then I saw a buff show up - I felt really bad then :) but 
I explained to him and apologized for snapping (because yeah, I DO 
appreciate buffs, hell, I'm levelling a shaman up just so I can *give* 
buffs for once) and he was very nice about it - and I got 2 free buffs 
out of the deal.

lol! My mage is having a hell of a time in North Ro with this - it's 
gotten to the point where I limp off somewhere quiet after a battle so I 
don't get accidentally healed - but trust me, I NEVER snap at someone for 
healing me - I simply say "thanks, but I'm trying to work on my bandaging 
skills" and keep at it.

Okay, this, I don't know.  What does breeze do to necros?
