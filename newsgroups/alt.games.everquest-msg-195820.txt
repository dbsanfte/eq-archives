All that is likely correct Tony, but, depending on how many
dedicated power-gamers show up in the early days, there can
be a lot of room for other folks to experience a less "tame"
environment than you see on the old servers.  The extreme
power-gamers will rush through the low/mid content so fast,
and then be busy for a while chewing up the low-end of the
high-end content in their rush to be "first", that there
should be a decent sized window of opportunity for other
players to establish themselves before everything has been
sanitized.  That's my hope, anyway.
