Good fucking god, give it a rest. The system was OBVIOUSLY paying out
over-inflated point values. They fixed it, and actually gave people a
"grace period" to use the benefits of the bug. They could easily have
just whacked with the nerf bat across the board and screwed everyone
rather than letting them have the perks. If someone racked up so many
points that they can't spend at least a good chunk of them in a WEEK
or more, it's a good bet that they realized it was broken and were
cashing in NOW in hopes that they'd get to keep the points for good.
That's the most likely reason for such marathon turn-ins that would
rack up totals like that.

They fixed something that was SEVERELY broken, and they did it in the
fairest way possible, and yet little children like you STILL whine. If
they left bugs like that in, the game would have died long ago rather
than still being alive and VERY healthy after this many years.
