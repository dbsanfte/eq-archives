I'll just add my me too.  I have a 56k, best connection I can get with Qwest
is 26.4k, no problems playing, loading zones takes a while, but not too bad,
seems to be pretty comparable to friends that have DSL or cable.  The system
I have seems to make a bigger difference than the connection speed, when I
upgraded to a 800MHz PIII with 256MB, that made a huge difference in
loading.  I wouldn't try to play a bard with my connection, but other than
that it works great.
