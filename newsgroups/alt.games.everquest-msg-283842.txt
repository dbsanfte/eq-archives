Twitching in a grp situation is a losers game - if I were in a grp with a 
cleric demanding twitch during the normal course of events I'd either dump 
her/him or leave myself.

A semi wipe situation when rebuffs are going on then i might make sense, 
sorta. I've seen clerics asking for twitch for mana regen after a semi wipe 
and they stood the whole time.

Twitching in a raid is also a losers strat, with the possible exception of a 
long drawn out fight lasting 10 to 20 minutes, then maybe. It's always 
better to get the Mob down faster if you can than drawing out the fight and 
trying to twitch clerics.

If a necro is being badgered to twitch in a normal group situation then you 
have the wrong cleric.

BTW this thread was started with this cleric question

=========

Silly me, I thought a necro's job (one of them anyways) was to provide much
needed mana to the casters of the group. After once again grouping with a
necro last night who does not do this (When I asked him if he could give me
some mana he said "no offence, but I have NEVER needed to use that spell
before!)... I am here to ask, what is a necro for then? They have a pet to
fight... I've heard they are not good fighters. I thought they were to
assist with the mana. My bad??

=========

Seems the cleric here thinks most if not all classes are cleric support 
classes. The story changed as the thread traveled on but the above was the 
original post.

I'm a raiding druid by the way - not a necro
