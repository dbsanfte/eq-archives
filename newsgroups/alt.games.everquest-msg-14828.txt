Sure they could -- you snipped the part where I told how:

# Just make
# an in-zone rez go through the "loading, please wait"
# process, and/or have it not clear aggro (I'm surprised to
# find out that it does).

They could also change the game so that each corpse could
only be rezzed once, instead of the current multiple
times.  This would make chain-rezzing of melee characters
(who can't be bound in the same zone) untenable.

They could increase the rez effect penalty, such that the
rezzee would be useless for fights until it wore off
(e.g. "The Princess Bride" :-)

And so on.

Furthermore, I fail to see why buff stacking is so
damned hard to code.  Give every buff a "class" number.
Buffs with the same class number stack, buffs with
different class numbers don't.  That would be a piece
of cake to code, and make it easy as hell to manage
what stacks with what.  Which buffs within the same
class number overwrite each other could be managed
by dedicating the lower N bits of the class number
to an overwrite priority.  Whatever Verant is
currently doing to handle buff stacking is obviously
done in a very poor manner, but it wouldn't take
long to change it to work well.
