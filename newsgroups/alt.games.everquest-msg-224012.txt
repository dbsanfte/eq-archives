Sorry, but this is all utter crap! (Not your comment Graeme!) He did the
work, he deserves the epic! I thought that I had read somewhere that
they had "solved" the MQ trouble by lowering faction when a char got
their spear. Be that as it may, SOE has solidly redirected EQ towards
grouping recently. What exemplifies cooperation more than MQ'ing, he
says tongue firmly in cheek?

I have struggled along since the last patch as previously described, but
have decided it's time to go. No you can't have my stuff as it is
already dispersed among guild mates :-). I have 4 accounts to cancel,
and will mention this nonsense to CS when I email them on other topics
related to my cancellation. May be just P'ing into the wind, but who
knows!!!
