What level are you fighting at?  Eventually master looters may become the
norm--they loot all corpses, split off, and then sell the sellables and
split everything evenly at the end.  No doubt some skim, but the majority
are honest.

Until then, don't be shy, straight-out say, "Hey, can you please leave some
mobs for me to loot?"  My warrior goes nuts having too manyc orpses around,
it messes with my targeting, so I get antsy if people don't clean up.  I'll
all but beg the casters to do some looting, but if they have no initiative
at that point, I'll eventually assume they're not interested.
