 Yeah hard to keep a guild doing when a mojority of your members take
1-3 month vacations in the summer. Those crazy Swedes...

 Backflagging isn't that much of a big deal these days. Except for
Saryrn and her broken encounter. Most of the guilds have flag sharing as
well and will let recruits from other guilds tag along and get flags if
they've done the mob before.

 I don't really consider backflagging to be bottomfeeding, either. The
flag issue, while better than it was, still needs something added or
changed. A guild leader should be able to acrue flags or something that
they can bestow upon others. To cut down on the abuse the person would
have to be guilded in the same guild and have to remain for 3-4 months
after which time the flag became permanent and went with the person even
if they changed guilds. 

 It's just dumb everytime you get a few more people to have to redo
encounters over and over but hey that's EQ's standard mode of
operation..

 As far as FoH goes... That's really Furor's own fault. With his
"ultimatum" and telling his own members how he was quitting, not playing
again and WoW was the best thing since sliced bread, he lost a lot of
good members when he "quit".It was really a bad morale move for his
members at the time.

 That or a gimp. I don't see anything wrong with that. He's what an 8
hour repop? The BP is pretty nice for the effort required.
