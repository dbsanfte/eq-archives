I would hate to know what sort on resist gear you need these days after the
resist patch a while ago. My Obscenely Twinked Scantily Clad has +83 disease
resist from items without buffs and cannot have a single fight with a blue
Patog Phlarg Feind in the paludal caverns without getting that stinking
Creeping Crud at least once, most of the time about 2-3 times...

Dragons?
