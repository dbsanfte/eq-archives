Mr. Hance is my father.  I'm Brian.  :-)

And I did qualify that I was definitely in the minority on my opinion
on Human Rangers.  That said, human rangers have the highest Natural
starting strength and stamina, adequate agility, but kinda low dex.
Now, I kinda messed up when I made Atticus many, many moons ago,
putting too many points into agi and more in dex because I was under
the impression that dex made a significant difference to archery.
Were I to do it today, I'd have put 15 points into Stamina to get it
up to 100, and another 5 into dex.  That would put a human at 80str,
100sta, 85agi, and 80dex.  Agi and dex are a bit low, but at 9 rangers
get Feet Like Cat which will take agi over 100 easily, and there is an
abundance of good melee gear that will get dex over 100.  (100 being
the goal because, IIRC, that's a significant break point for stats.)

Humans have lower starting Wis than Wood elves, but with gear I only
have 90 wis with Att, and it has never, ever been a factor.  The only
combat spells I really cast are snare and panic animal, both of which
have such a trivial casting cost that I can med it back while beating
on something in combat all most.  I'm not saying that it's not a
factor, but for me it's so insignificant as to be pointless.  

Now, I FREELY admit, I'm not the stat guy, so this would be the part
where good Mr. Heffernan will whip out some log files and statistical
analysis to show me how I am definitely, and unequivocally wrong.  :-)

And anywho, Wood Elves just look way, way, WAY too effeminate for
tastes.  Human, hands down, make the best looking ranger race.  And
looks DO matter.  How much depends on the individual.
