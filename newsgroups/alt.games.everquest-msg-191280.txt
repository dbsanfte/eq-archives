Well if you're a griefer that's part of a guild which doesn't mind then
you're ok, but if I make a character just to mass murder I'll have a much
tougher time since after level 35 you have nowhere to bind.  You respawn at
a random ruins location and must hoof it to your favorite ganking spots.
Not to say it can't be done, but it is much more difficult.

I tend to not make a character that just kills anyone I can, but I do
realize I'm not the norm so your points are well taken.  My point is simply
that if you don't have a group of people willing to behave this way with a
city and all you're at a serious disadvantage, and many guilds don't want
people like this associated with them unless they too want to do this.  Your
city will simply burn to the ground if you harbor griefers unless you're the
biggest bully on the block, and even then it's in doubt.
