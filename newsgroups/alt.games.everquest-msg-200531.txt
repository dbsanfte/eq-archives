No, it does not seem odd at all that a spell associated with the
Rainkeeper stops rain.  Try this:  make a new character, get to
the diety selection, click on "The Rainkeeper" and read what it
says.  Seems to me that Wake of Karana is very much in keeping
with the belief that without Karana the surface of Norrath would
be engulfed in an endless storm.  ;)

The particular wonderfulness of Karana in the Norrathian mythos is
that he moderates the mindless extremes of the weather so that the
world gets only the wind and water it needs, or so we are told.
