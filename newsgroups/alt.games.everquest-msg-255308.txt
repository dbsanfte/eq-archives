I wonder if it would have stayed fun longer if they hadn't instituted
the purple patch. One of the quickly boring things about CoH is how
repetitive it gets either grouped or solo when you are forced to stick
to mobs 3-4 levels above you because of the steeply ramped up
impossibility of hitting anything higher. If groups could pit themselves
against more challenging fights it might have remained a bit amusing
longer, at least for me, but the wretched experience in groups that are
forced to fight mobs that many can solo and the boredom of soloing just
got old really fast. There's a huge difference between ramping the
challenge up linearly and slamming a brick wall up.
