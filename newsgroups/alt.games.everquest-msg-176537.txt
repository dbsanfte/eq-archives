We have a long-running AD&D group going (5 PCs plus the DM, current
characters for a couple of years) and we try our damnedest to get it
together about every 6 weeks.  Even after a couple of years, my
half-ogre fighter is still only level 6.  However, he does wield two
two-handed swords  - how about the large races being able to do that
in EQ?  ;^)

You're right about the time - setting up a D&D session requires a lot
of pre-planning by the DM, usually involves some
travel/stopovers/dogsitters (for our group, anyway), and the
consumption of large quantities of biscuits, chocolates and alcohol.
We usually make a weekend of it, as it just isn't worth the effort if
you dedicate less time.  With EQ, I can be in a different world with
my characters in a matter of minutes, and I can pick and choose what I
play depending on my mood.

The OP wishes that EQ was as great as D&D - AFAIC they are not
comparable.  They're two different things, loosely related.
