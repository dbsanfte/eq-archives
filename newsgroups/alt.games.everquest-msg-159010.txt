I followed you advice and i think this could be one of my favorite zones.
The druid snares while the monk beats upon the griffon, then druid fears,
bash bash bash, dead griffon, and a long awaited revenge on the griffons in
east commons with good xp to boot!

Also, killing poachers is intrinsically satisfying for a druid.

I've not been game to tackle the gnolls yet, but the brell serilis are
polite enough, and don't go on about me ruining their lands which is a good
thing. Wolfform is very useful especially as share greater wolf form became
possible. I'm dubious to the druids/rangers here in wolf, threatening or
scowling otherwise (can't recall). Hope to change it; my iksar is a born
again lizard, and likes getting good faction. A shame they don't let you
make iksar monks agnostic. Or do a quest to change religions.
