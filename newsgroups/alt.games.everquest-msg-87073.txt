My main is a Druid raised entirely outdoors, so I have developed a 
healthy dislike of dungeons, if not outright claustrophobia. I don't like 
fighting indoors, but I would like to visit some new zones. Which 
dungeons would be reasonably safe for a lvl 40 to wander around? I've 
seen Crushbone, Befallen, Blackburrow and Unrest (thanks to the Wolf Form 
exploit).

Is there anywhere else I could visit without being swarmed by green trash 
and being killed horribly?
