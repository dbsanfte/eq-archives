I'm on my 3rd Cleric.  The first one was a halfing, and deleted her for
aesthetic reasons around level 15.  Then I got a high elf up to about
9ish.  I just played her as a lark, though, and never considered even
close to being my main.  Well, I didn't really consider any of my
characters to be a main, really, though I guess my ranger or shaman
would have come closest to that.  
   Then I moved to FV, and took up a cleric there.  It's nice to have a
main, I've found.

Annie <--- Sorta wishes she had rolled her as a dark elf now, though.
