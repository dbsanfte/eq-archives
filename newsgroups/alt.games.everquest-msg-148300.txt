Since one of your characters can go to Velious but one cannot, for me that
would point at a corrupted file for that character.

Do a Find on your EQ folder and put in the character name.  I believe you
should get at least 2 hits.  Change each name a little bit (eg,
DanHarmon.ini >> oDanHarmon.ini) and crank up the game again.

Your character should not have any hotbuttons and all windows should be
default, just like you created a new character.  If so, NOW try to get him
to Velious & see if he can.
