I'm a 54 necro that has always soloed.  What is my role in a group?

Found myself in a group and didn't know what to do.  Figured my
best purpose was to melee my pet, dump my mana into the cleric,
and cast a heal or two when someone was it trouble.  When the
cleric was gone, I tapped life and healed others as fast as possible.
Figured my best bet was to keep the healer full of mana and alive
at all costs.  Am I really filling my role or should I be trying to DOT
and DD?
