I'm assuming this is only a recent problem, I.E you used to be able to play
EQ before and now you are plagued with crashes, If this is infact the case
might I suggest uninstalling all versions of EQ, and then reinstalling a
fresh.
Yes it will mean a long re-patch but it kinda reminds me of a joke I heard
the other day ...


One day, a mechanical engineer, electrical engineer,
chemical engineer, and computer engineer were driving
down the street in the same car when it broke down.

The mechanical engineer said, "I think a rod broke."

The chemical engineer said, "The way it sputtered at the
end, I think it's not getting enough gas."

The electrical engineer said, "I think there was a spark
and something's wrong with the electrical system."

All three turned to the computer engineer and said,
"What do you think?"

The computer engineer said, "I think we should all get out
and then get back in."
