The named at the Camps are often SK's or Necro's but although in low 50's
are real undercons in Melee damage.
A 52 SK rarely managed to hit my 53 warrior for over 100 when most 52 mobs
can hit in the 130 range. The Lifetap is a PITA but not too much of a worry
with slow. Loot isn't great, they don't drop much plat but the Coterie
weapons sell for about 5pp each and you can dress your Bazaar mule in
stylish, blood red, leather, afterwards.
Faction hits don't seem to effect guards outside Katta, I haven't been in
Katta since I've been killing them for TS Quests.
