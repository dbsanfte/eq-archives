Well, obviously, I did set it to 'prompt before install' for those two 
minutes.  I have heard, despite Microsoft's marketing, that that is still 
not secure, and there are still vulnerabilities, even if it prompts you 
first for the properly-signed controls.  I'm not a champion hacker, so I 
have no proof of that, but I remember it having been brought up as an 
issue before.  To go with our lock metaphor, yes, it may not be completely 
removing the lock, but it is taking out the deadbolt. :)
