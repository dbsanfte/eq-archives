True enough.  But the old comment that "it's not big and it's not clever" is
also true.  They used to say that bad language was the sign of a limited
vocabulary, and that's quite true, too.  Tyger's right that most bad
language is to be found issuing from the mouths of kids - whatever age they
might be.  It's the simple route and as such it's the most frequently
travelled.

Unfortunately we do live in a world where consideration for others is
considered an outmoded concept.  On the other hand, the increased profanity
these days is due to the current "f*** you, Jack, I'm all right" fashion,
coupled with the fact that society continues to make such fuss about these
words.

People who swear do it to shock, and delight in the transports of horror
they can often elicit from others.  Therefore, I believe that if we treated
profanity for what it is - merely sad and fairly pitiable - then we might
start to find that kids don't get so pleased with themselves when they do
it.
