I think (or at least hope) that this is the direction it's heading. I,
for one, would not cry "nerf" if they made these changes, even if it
meant that a couple of my wizard's current trash items no longer had a
focus effect. I'd just consider it part of the tuning process, and be
happy that they are at least making the attempt to continue the caster
balancing.

Having the focus items be on primarily no-drop items, that only fall in
dungeons, staged out similar to the proposed example you give above
would be an ideal solution, IMO.  Later on, they could even add in a
Level IV if they wanted with some slightly enhanced bonus's that *did*
only drop in TOV and above encounters. That way all levels would reap a
bonus, but there would still be some minor reward for making all the way
up to the level where you can kill AoW, et. al.  This sort of thing
doesn't have to happen all in one mad sweep. It can be implemented over
time, and watched for tuning as they go. 

Hell, I'd say put a couple of level one items deep in Befallen and
Blackburrow too. Not the best ones, maybe, but a couple. And add some
better Level I ones to Sol A on your list as well.  For level II, add to
your list deeper parts of CC, 4th to 6th floors of ToFS, and
Nurga/Droga.  For level III, add in the buzzsaws in Air and the Undead
tower in Hole. If they are semi-rare (read not "stupidly nonexistent")
drops, and no-drop, it would work out fine I think.
