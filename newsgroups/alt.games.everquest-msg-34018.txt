I am hoping to see SW episode 2 knowing as little as possible, and I
am going to try to do that while still reading a Star Wars
newsgroup... I am very good at hanging out in offtopic threads :)
(Mentioning this since we've begun discussing the spoiler saturation
we know is going to come and this, combined with heavy use of 'ignore
thread' and not reading SW websites, was my personal solution. A lot
of people there knew everything about the Phantom Menace before they
actually saw the movie, and they are wanting to avoid doing the same
thing for the new film.)
