Multi-day raids in sky were an artifact of some of the dumbest quest
designs and zone designs in the game.

On the other hand - it is a choice you made to help friends get their
epics.  I put in some serious hours bound to the top of the 2nd house in
sky to help our huge numbers of druids and rangers get their jade reavers.

I don't whine and cry about the fact that I spent most of my playing time
for a summer (not a week) not getting xp or loot.  I look around at people
in my current guild and I *see* those epics still in the hands of the
folks who were in that family guild.  

I made a choice to belong to this guild and try more raiding than I had
before.  I made a committment to a certain level of attendence.  For 
quite a while I just basked in the knowledge that my efforts (learning my
way to Yelinak, keeping CoV faction) was helping people I liked.  I used
to just watch the calls for bids on items flow by me, because I wasn't sure
what direction I wanted to take in my gear.  That doesn't mean I wasn't 
getting anything, by last night I had the 3rd highest RPP total in the
guild.  Of course, one of the people with more was a 'chanter who bid my
total +1 on the ornate robe pattern last night (/em sticks his tongue out
at Dyssi).  By the time the Orb of the Stormwatcher came up for bid I
was miles out in front of any others, and was able to tailor my bid to
just barely beat the point total of my nearest competitor.

There's absolutely no reason not to raid and do LDoN.  I can maintain a
75% attendence on 10-12 hours a week (we go in with specific targets, and
often take them out in pretty short order.  At that time we may take a
smaller raid somewhere or not, but it's pretty optional.)  The rest of my
time in EQ I spend in LDoN, XP camps (BoT mainly of late), and leveling my
2nd account BL (I want someone to actively fight dragons with :)  Of course 
my incredibly schizophrenic style leads to very slow results, but there you
go.
