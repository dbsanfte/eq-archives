Every bit counts, In this game efficiency is about eaking out every little
percentage where you can. You will seldom see huge gains anywhere at anyone
time.
But 500hp per fight means less healing and it means that you can wait a tick
longer for the cheal and it means that more mana is available to Nuke MoR
DoT what ever.

It makes a difference though. and when your grinding away efficiency is
important. Is it important enough? That's for the individual to decide. The
fact is however you still will do better tanking with slower high ration
weapons than low delay ones.

In which case the WB has another advantage of more AC/HP on it.
Is it worth 10k? I'd say that depends on the person. The question was which
was superior and the fact remains that for tanking purposes the Windblade is
the superior choice of the two. Perhaps if you were talking a higher ratio 2
hander like GSo4W then the dps advantage would put it out in top. But
between the WB and WMBS the descision is clear. And the fact that it costs
10k more shows that generally people think its a superior weapon. About
10kpp more superior.

The price difference isn't for the dps its for the other advantages you get
using the WB and if the two were closer to parity in overal value tehn the
price in the bazaar wouldn't have that much disparity.

Didn't blame the weapon blamed lag or innatentiveness. Either way your gonna
take a hell of a lot less damage in that moment of either glancing to your
side to see what noise that was you heard or because your lag bar blanked
out for 10 seconds during the fight and the mob moved from 25 to 9% and in
enraged. Or because you were beating on its back when it enraged and didn't
notive that the huge bastard turned on you til your HP bar started to melt.
Be insulting if you like. I've survived enough enrage mobs that I'm not
worried about it. (in fact its been a long time since I died to one) but it
sure didn't hurt that I tend to use my WB when in close. I'll be interested
to see how my new toy works (GSo4W) with its 31dly (effective 17dly with SoV
according to my parse)

But beyond that it does come alot down to preference.
Still the WB is the superior tanking weapon and people tend to see it enough
superior that it commands a premium in price. Its been out long enough that
its pretty much stablelized and its relative position isn't gonna be jumping
around a lot unless some really uber droppable 2 handers start materializing
out of Ldon.

Remember the original question was do the tanks needed a WMBS in addition to
the Windblade. And given the difference in DPS carrying about a WMBS in
addition would be a waste of 8-10k and an inventory slot.

Course it won't matter in the end. Nice Knight weapons drop like candy so
its not like they won't get something better and no drop once they start
raiding a little.
