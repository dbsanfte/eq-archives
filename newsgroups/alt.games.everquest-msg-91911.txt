One item to note in the skill list above is that monks get block while the
others get parry.  Block is *much* better than parry.  I read on Monkly
Business that a Block skill of 230 is equivalent to a Parry skill of 700.
Don't know how true that is but I know Block fires on my monk a lot more
than Parry does on my Ranger or Paladin.
