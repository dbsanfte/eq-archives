>Personally my first character back in the beta days was a shaman....

My first character is my main and didn't even make your list:  a half elf
ranger.  
Positives:
1. you get tracking early on.  Great when you really *DON'T* know what's out
there that's going to want you dead, or need to get to a guard or specific
shopkeeper or to locate your friends at some bandit camp.
2. healing, (ok not good healing but better than NO healing)
3. forage - I never buy food.
4. snare - that gnoll won't run you into a group of his friends when he's
almost dead, and if you're low on health you can get away.
5. debuffs, buffs, and damage shield.
6. harmony, invisibility, cure poison, and root
7. sow.
