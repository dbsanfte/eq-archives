Our guild had a few fun events (unfortunately before i joined):
Drunken race in Arena. Run 3 times around the arena while drunk (no 
sow/jboots allowed). This is good no matter the level, since being 
higher level dont mean much here if someone are smarter. Fun to try to 
beat each other up to take the lead while drunk.

Or the real funny one (require a porter on a PvP server, let everyone 
make a newbie troll, outfit with newbie weapons, get troll army ported 
to BB, bind everyone in Gfay near the BB zone line and charge Kelethin.
