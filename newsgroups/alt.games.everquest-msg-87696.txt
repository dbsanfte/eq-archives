The unplanned server outage last night really showed how addicted some of 
us are to this damn game.  By 7:30pm there were almost 30 members of my 
guild sitting in a chat on AIM, BSing, someone said we could at least 
pretend we were playing, and I'll be damned if we didn't start spamming 
raid spam all over the chat.  Juggs inc!  Tash on Juggs!  OOS in on Juggs.  
Juggs snared.  Juggs dead.  Prot inc!  Assist me on <<Prot!>> You get the 
idea.  
I guess it worked though, because as soon as the servers were up, we 
hauled ass to Seb, killed Trak, and then went to VP to kill a couple 
more dragons.  Hell, if it hadn't been for Silverwing coming to visit when 
we were still CoHing folks to the safespot, unbuffed and ungrouped, I 
think we would have averaged less than one death a person (other than VP 
extraction deaths) all night.
