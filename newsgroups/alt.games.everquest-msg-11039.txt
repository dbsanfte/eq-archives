Not raid level yet. And as stated, I don't think they're necessary
*all the time*, but I prefer the company of someone who does have the
courtesy of keeping the other healer informed about some of their
actions instead of being *completely* silent, like this guy was. It's
not a matter of informing everyone all the time but a matter of
knowing WHEN to inform others if appropriate. The cleric might well be
on top of things, but how am I to know if he says nothing at all or
doesn't even tell me me whether or not he wants me to do secondary
heals at all? I know I'm not a cleric, I don't fight like a cleric or
think like a cleric in combat... but I do fight and think like a
healer and it bugs me when a cleric acts like he's the only healer
around.

A lot of my groups have been outdoors, and a lot of the stuff I do can
draw significant aggro if I don't back away. So, sometimes I'm
standing too far from the cleric to see him cast (especially with
spells turned off), and my eyes are usually more on the mob I'm trying
to snare than on the cleric, who might not even be in my screen. If I
trust the cleric, I can just go with knowing his mana level, let him
take care of most heals and just be ready for the low mana calls and
*then* ask to have heals called if necessary so I can chip in. If it's
someone I don't know, it's different, especially if I don't even know
if he's low on mana or not.
