    I assume you mean the quested route into CoD, in which case there's
another key that's CoD-related on the keyring. The key to get into the lower
part of CoD, where the Bertox event takes place, goes on the keyring after
hailing the NPC at the end of the High Priest Ultor event.

    VT interior keys are added to the keyring, but only show up on /key when
you're in the zone.

    Yes, it's on there, too.
