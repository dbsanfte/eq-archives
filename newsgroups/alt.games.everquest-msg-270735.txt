It's probably too early for you guys to be able to answer this but are 
all classes including the doctor viable for soloing? I like grouping but 
I would also like the option to solo when I feel like it without being a 
complete gimp as I am in EQ with my cleric. Well, actually I have soloed 
with my cleric mostly in Natimbi and have that down to a science but it 
is slow going and probably does not compare to what is possible with 
most any other class in EQ, save perhaps Rogues, Warriors and Enchanters.
