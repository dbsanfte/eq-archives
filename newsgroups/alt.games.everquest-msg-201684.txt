The highest lvl is 65, but after lvl 51 you can "customize" you character by
putting lvl experience into special Alternate Advancement areas.  There are
people who are lvl 63 with 24 AA points (so really they are 63+24=lvl 87).
AA can be in better spell casting, faster running, faster healing, better
hitting, pretty much improving all abilities of your character.

Hope this helps.
