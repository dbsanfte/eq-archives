Well, as an SK, you will find maxing 2 of the tier 1 AA's very nice. The 
first is Run- GET RUN 3. Run3 took out much of EQs aggravation for me as a 
Monk- I have Run 1 on my cleric, and as soon as I get 56(my best rez) and a 
decent buffer I will pump that to Run3.

Regen3 will serve you well also, if you are the type I was when I played a 
Monk. I would frequently get myself places that were... uncomfortable, just 
exploring and running around. Stuck FD is a crappy place to be, and Regen3 
helps shorten that a bit.

All the other Tier1 abilities are silly- stat gains are *so* trivial 
compared to the amount of exp it takes, and the others are laughable at 
best (What? Lung capacity? Has *anyone* ever bought that?)

After those, I would go back to regular XP (unless you want to be a Baron, 
then get 2 more points :P)
