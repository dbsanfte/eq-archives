I took a heretic cleric from level 5 to level 9 there just staying in
the doorway. She's still there LFG occassionally. Find a partner or more
for your first couple of levels, and after that you might be able to
solo with just your pet for company. 

Do: Zone as soon as you hear a shout about a train coming. Call your own
trains. Hunting by the door means you ARE on the tracks, and as soon as
the guy running zones, the train will jump on you. Keep an eye out for
random wanderers. Usually a runt wanders all the way across the entry
hall, but somtimes it is a Howler. Howlers are level 9ish, and will take
your lunch money and make you cry for some time to come. Zone
immediately, unless you can take it.

Save your molars. Hand them in Paineel in the Royal Palace. If you have
a body who can invis you (i don't remember if necros get this), you may
be able to hand the molars in Erudin- but it's not likely that those
folk will speak to your nasty self.

I also took my good cleric from level 12 to 18 down further in, by
medding in the room with the Kerran prisoners. They have since added a
Erudite to this room, which means it is no longer a safe room for Evils-
although most Evils have no trouble taking out this Erudite. Pull the
pit fighters, the smithy, and the kitchen to this room. There is another
safe room not far from the prince, and you can pull various things in
that area to that room, and at higher levels take on the Prince and his
guards, or the King, and in your high 20s, come back for the Muglwump.

Hope this helps a little.
