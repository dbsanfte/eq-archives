What is "inc."

1.  When pulling some people say that "incs" are coming.......or
something like that.

2.  In the aqueducts of qeynos, how many times do you have to kill
cubert to get the evidence of the missing girl?

3.  In bb, what drops Gnoll skins. (non-ruined)   I think that elite
drop the pelts.

4.  When I learned kick and then round kick with my lev 7 monk and make
them both hotkeys  and start autoattack...he never seems to do the
roundkick even though both blocks fade and come back like they are being
used.

5.  Any skills that I should practice on more then others for a lev 8
human monk?


Thanks In advance
