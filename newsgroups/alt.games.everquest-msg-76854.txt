The problem with these things is that people expetc to sell to people
as fast and anytime as they can sell things to a merchant. I quite
often sit around for ages in EC not seeling a thing (and it's good
stuff like Centi Shortswords etc for reasonable prices). I have no
patience and no idea of prices, though :) Just sold a few level 55+
dropspells for 300 pp a piece and have no idea if I did well. At least
I don't run out of food.

: loot 6 of them by level 7 for a nice 120pp.  The silk threads she will

Such prices also highly depend on the zone you are in. Bone chips will sell
very bad in the tower of Kurns :)
