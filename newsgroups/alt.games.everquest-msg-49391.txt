Stop falling for this please. These are hoaxes which are designed to
make the unwary forward this email to everyone so that they forward
their email to everyone so that they forward their email to everyone
and when It happens to a mail server at a big company it brings it to
its knees. 

The irony is that doing this is basically a low tech terrorist attack
in itself as it is MEANT to clog email traffic. People use such
current events as the US terrorist attack as a way to cause the unwary
to forward these emails or to (surprise) post them in newsgroups.

Here is a clue:

No valid email, or post, will EVER ask you to forward that email to
everyone or to email it to everyone. NEVER. If it does it is a hoax.
No valid company or corperation or virus warning company EVER tells
you to forward something to everyone, NEVER. Anytime you see that
anywhere in the message, its a hoax delete it and don't forward it.

This is the data fellows (fsecure anti virus) hoax site, which is
quite useful and educational:

List of the latest:

Here is yet another example there of how the terrorist attack is now
being used to cause this forwarding. The people doing this and sending
these out are sick individuals and by forwarding/posting this you feed
the fire:


"AME: Terrorist attacks on malls hoax 
ALIAS: Malls, Halloween attack 

In beginning of October 2001 several people have received a following
hoax warning about possible terrorist attacks on shopping malls at
Halloween. This warning is a typical urban legend and should not be
taken seriously. 

If you receive this message or similar please ignore it do not pass it
on. 

For more information see:
http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blmall-terror.htm  "


That URL is also useful to find hoaxes.


Another one is the Klingerman postal mailbox viral agent warning.
This originally popped up arond may of 2000 but in light of the
terrorist attacks it started getting forwarded around again:

http://www.datafellows.com/hoaxes/klingerm.shtml

Here is an example from the bottom of it of the forwarding it on tag:

"PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE YOU CARE ABOUT."

Once again no valid warning to you from a company or anyone in an
email you get will ever tell you to pass it on.

The fsecure blurb about it on their hoax page:

"Do not forward hoax messages. We've seen cases where e-mail systems
have collapsed after dozens of users forwarded a false alert to
everybody in the company. Corporate users can get rid of the hoax
problem by simply setting a strict company guideline: End users must
not forward virus alarms. Ever. It's not the job of an end user
anyway. If such message is received, end users could forward it to the
IT department but not to anyone else. "
