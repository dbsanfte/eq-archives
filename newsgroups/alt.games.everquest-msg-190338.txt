Wow, and, big coincidence, a fairly easy cash cow hit the fan about a
month ago for those with the time to do it: Prismatic Dye. Not to
mention all the new items a new expansion brings that are always in
high demand and, thus, people will pay high prices for. Oh, and should
I mention that at least since PoP, millions of plat are trivial to
make for top-tier characters in uberguilds, many of whom aren't shy
about cashing in on it?
