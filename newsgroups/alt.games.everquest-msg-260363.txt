Yep, a RP server where RP rules of engagement are enforced at some level, 
would be a great approach. I'd sign up there in a heartbeat if it were 
offered (assuming I decided to go with WoW). These happen as a matter of 
course when fans start unofficially designating a server "the unofficial rp 
server", but I'd like to see it formalized sufficiently so that the 
battle.net crowd that views "role-playing server" as a bunch of geeks 
running around using affected speech, will stay away. In fact, Blizzard 
should simultaneously designate a "Power server", where all the minmax, 
gamey guys can go. By pre-emptively corralling this crowd into a particular 
server, they might actually be able to segregate their audience in a way 
that gives it a chance to diversify and flourish. LOL it'll never happen, 
but could you imagine?

Good, because I think the game is worth that and it wasn't my intention to 
create the counter impression. There's a lot more I could say about the 
specific reason that I will not be playing WoW when it comes out, but I'll 
leave it at this: it's not because of this game. More than any other, WoW 
was *the* game that I was looking forward to, and my failure to make the 
closed beta was a huge disappointment to me (but not a surprise, for some 
reason I never make Blizzard betas). Rationalizing my sideline view by 
giving the critical voice in me a greater forum might be a reason the 
negative comments flowed more freely than the positive, but let me be clear: 
There's a lot about this game that I liked when I played during the stress 
test, and the choice whether or not to play would be a true no-brainer for 
me were it not for another choice I've got that will probably negate that 
option.

The WoW world is gorgeous and appears to be huge and full of variety. Like a 
lot of the people who summarily dismissed the game because "I don't wanna 
play in a cartoon", my original reaction to the artwork was high skepticism. 
After all, we've all watched the evolution from 2d sprites in UO, to the 
early EQ models, to the glorious "realism" of recent MMOGs, and the idea of 
playing in a world of animated toons seemed both retro and "Toontown"-ish. 
Until you play it. Running around under the moonlight in Dun Morogh is 
drop-dead gorgeous, and the fact that every new community that I visited 
during my limited exposure was as interesting and varied as I could hope 
for, with the wonderfully sculpted touch of a Disney animator, just 
foretells a great game world ahead. My wife and I could explore this game 
world for months and have a great time doing it.

The thing I didn't like about the questing system is that it really didn't 
feel very immersive, the "questing" was pro-forma and seemed designed to 
just occupy time from point A to point B, with very little logical thought 
or backstory cohesiveness tying it together. But maybe that's just because I 
saw such a small part of it. But I would think this would be something that 
would emerge early in the game in order to provide some direction. Still, it 
may not be important to some, it certainly hasn't limited EQ's popularity. 
The thing that the questing system *does* do well is provide lots of things 
to do while getting from point A to point B, and making it as easy as 
possible to track those things. Really, the accounting system for quests is 
one of the best I've ever seen (although it appears this is becoming pretty 
standard in new generation MMOGs), and in my view this really helps any MMOG 
because computers are really good at that kind of stuff.

I played both a caster and a fighter in the stress test. My warrior got to 
level 8, as did my mage (I only played for the first 4 days) and I found 
both characters had very enjoyable combat experiences. The Warrior was a bit 
light on moves (his next was not available until level 12 so I never saw 
it), and there were no Talents in at the time so I suspect the class will 
get more interesting at release when these are all in. Still, this was not 
"start swinging, go get a cup of coffee" combat. There were moves to make 
that had to be timed and watched for maximum effectiveness. Nothing as nice 
as my Friar's positional and opportunity hits in DAoC, but enough to keep it 
from becoming too predictable. But again, only 4 days and 8 levels, so who 
knows. The mage was just fun as hell to play. At the end I got a new instant 
blast spell that was an ideal way to start combat (and of course the perfect 
tool for winning the "hit-first from a distance" races), and made up for the 
slow casting times of the mainline spells. The animations and effects were 
pretty fun and satisfying, with great sounds and the expected overall polish 
of a Blizzard gaming experience. Highly fun to play in those respects.

And then you get to the spawn camping and interactions with all the l33t 
battle.net doods. There's lots of room for speculation over whether this 
factor will be significant in later levels or after release (the whole 
credit card debate, etc), but I'm of the opinion that little will change 
here, and one either comes to terms with this or doesn't. That's my opinion, 
and I'd probably spend more time strategizing ways to obviate this negative 
if I were going to play it on release. I look forward to hearing more from 
those who make that choice, I'll be tracking it closely.

Yep, I had the same opinion as I looked out over the horizon a few months 
ago and considered the two games in the abstract. SOE has a shitload to do 
to make up for lost credibility. And in that regard, actions -- not words --  
will be required.
