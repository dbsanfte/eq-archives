Because, there was an exploit. If you were in East Commons tunnel, and
sitting on one of the logs or in  a firepot, and you opened a trade window
with lots of money, if anyone cancelled the trade, the money fell to the
ground. Scammer then picks it up really fast, and camps. Honest person
wonders where his money went, and petitions for reimbursal. Of course, they
could be on on the scam- and demand reimbursal to double their money...
Fortunately, this exploit no longer works as a result.
