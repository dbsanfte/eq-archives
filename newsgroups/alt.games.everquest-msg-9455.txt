I'm currently working on these quests, and have gotten to the fourth one.

For this quest, I need to find Tanik Greskil, in Eastern Wastes, near the
Kael Drakkel entrance.

the quest continues as follows:

"You say, 'hail Tanik Greskil'

Tanik Greskil says 'Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last
surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody
Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was
barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly
hurt and need your help.

You say, 'i will help'

Tanik Greskil says 'Quickly, give me a vial of Veluim Vapors so I can return
home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics.

You say, 'what is velium vapors'

Tanik Greskil says 'Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you?
Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one.
I will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep
from being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope.

You say, 'hail Frundle Frenkler'

You say, 'what velium vapors'

Frundle Frenkler says 'Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all
you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a
velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this
jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret.


You say, 'what velium vial?'

Frundle Frenkler says 'I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly
it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards.
Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality
firing sheet.

The vial is trivial at lower skill than 130.

Small piece of velium and small block of velium can be looted on Ry'Gorr
Minors in Crystal Caverns

Crystalline Silk can be found on spiders in the same zone. So basicly,
Up to here, it's rather easy.

Do not camp the spot where Tanik Greskil is. because i did it, and got
A message: You have been ambushed by frost giants! And two Komriff Death
Squad will spawn, and try to kill you. Which was the case for me.

When you get Tanik Greskil to spawn again. just hand him the vial

Tanik Greskil says 'Thank you,Rassal . I shall be eternally grateful to you.
Should you ever require my assistance I pledge to you my aid. Please deliver
this to Borannin, it is imperative that he deliver this to the Dain at once.
Farewell for now outlander...

You gain experience!!"

now, I already have the vial completed. Can I skip the part where I have to
find Frundle and just immediately give him the vial when he asks for it?
will this yield the same results? or do I have to have him despawn, and then
make him respawn?

does anyone know? and sorry this post is so long..
