Even if it is a router along the way, the error recovery is very bad. You
get tossed from the game and have to wait for the character to time out
before you are even allowed to get back in the game with *any* character.
This is really a brain dead way of doing things. If you try to login a
character that is still in the game you should be able to do so immediately.
