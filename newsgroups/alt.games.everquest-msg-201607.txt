Got really good use out of them in an all pet group once, the puller
was deliberately pulling 2, each tanked by a pet, and the 3 mages
were raining away - that way you get 2 waves of 2 hits each, which is
IME the most effective way to use them.

Unfortunately it's very rare in PoP to get groups who like to have
2 mobs unmezzed in camp at a time :)
