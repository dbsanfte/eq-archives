The 5th floor (wedding) in ToFS, comes complete with a priest, guests, angry
relatives and a bride and groom that you'll have to forcefully evict (and
get some phat lewts for doing so =P)

Combine spires in DL, wandering skellies all over, but beautiful place.

Queen Dracnia's room in Crystal Caverns.

Inside the Ring of Fire in Acrylia Caverns =P... um... wait, you just wanted
to kill the newbies, not the entire wedding right? uh... nevermind.
