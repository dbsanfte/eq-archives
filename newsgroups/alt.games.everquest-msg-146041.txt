There are many of us who love playing EQ but can only do so for an hour 
or three at a time.  For those of us that do not belong to a large active 
guild, this means pickup groups or soloing.  And pickup groups can be 
very dangerous.

This leaves us one of three choices as our playtime is time-constrained:  
solo and get less XP per kill, certainly die in a pickup group, or quit 
EQ.

I do not consider myself anti-social or asocial; just time-challenged.
