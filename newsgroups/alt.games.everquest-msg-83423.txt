It actually makes more sense in the movie than in the book. 

Would you think it's more plausible for the one and only weapon to slay
the Witch-king to come from:

a) by accident, from some foggy spook-hole in barrows way, way, way great 
distance East from where the makers of the blade once lived, or

b) from an actual flesh-and-blood heir to the throne of Numenorian lands,
rightful ruler of the very place they were forged?
