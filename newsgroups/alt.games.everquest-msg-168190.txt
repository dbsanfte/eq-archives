    Last night I did Torture to help a guildmate's twink mage (as "twink" as
a 60 MAG with epic gets, anyways) get flagged for PoV/PoS. We had planned on
doing Executioner, but one of the two mages in the group blew that on the
first wave by Banishing the mob we'd been killing (whoops!)

    Torture is set up pretty simply. Four waves of four mobs, fungusbeasts
and shades, 2.5 minutes between waves. Shades can be mezzed, fungusbeasts
(which are necromancers) cannot. Once all mobs are dead, a boss spawns that
can triple for 700, he's unslowable and once every 10 seconds or so there's
an 100 point AoE with knockback in the room. There is a time limit, but we
didn't hit it and I took a fair while to med up. How do you med up? Keep one
shade perma-mezzed, and the boss won't spawn. Stuff hits in the mid-300's,
so weak compared to PoV/PoS/CoD XP mobs.

    We had a warrior as tank, and once he hit Defensive the damage output on
the boss was laughable. Seriously - the XP mobs in CoD drop his health
faster when unslowed than that boss did. I wish my guildmates had done
Torture instead of Executioner to get flags, as it was never camped and is
very straightforward. I can honestly say if you cannot handle what gets
thrown at you in Torture, you aren't ready to do XP in PoV/PoS/CoD - and I
wouldn't say that about Executioner.
