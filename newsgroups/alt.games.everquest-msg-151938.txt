Hey guys, been playing EQ for about a month now as a Human Warrior and made
it up to lvl 23 so far.  I always liked the strength a warrior has in other
games but in this one it seems the Warrior is at a huge dissavantage(slow
moving, no magic, easy for a magic user to pk and root me etc.).  I was
playing and a high lvl bard helped me out a bit and watched him fly through
zones and cast some great stuff.  I was thinking this guy is great and can't
see him getting pked unless by a huge group.  Even he said it would be
almost impossible for him to die.  Now I am thinking that I have picked the
wrong guy to be.  I guess I am wondering if being a bard is that fun?  Is it
hard for one to start off and would any bards here recommend it to a newbie?
Thanks for any help you guys can give.
