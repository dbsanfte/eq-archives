LoL
And that's why the entrepreneurs laugh at the economists and their theories.
Supply and demand. If no profit it in the investment then no supply.
Theory is such a lovely concept.  Maybe schools should start teaching
"Reality Macro/Micro Econ 101".

For EQ there are many tradesman that could care less about profit and fund
skills for friends and guild. There are lots of EQ traders that measure fun
in how much plat is growing as well.

Bottom line if you don't like the prices take up the trade yourself or wait
and look for a deal.
