But nothing has been given to us to make us more attractive to groups.    In
fact, they just took AWAY one of our few group friendly features, Hamony.
They didn't even give us anything to take it's place, except a PROMISE of a
spell SOMEDAY that might or might NOT be obtainable (it could be an ultra
rare, impossible-to-get item) and won't even do what the old disabled spell
could do.

BEFORE we were asked to port people, then patted on our heads and told to go
away while the big boys did their fighting.  No room in a big fight for a
watered down cleric is there?  Nor do they need a second rate Wizzie...

NOW, we won't even get asked for the PORT.  At LEAST before we used to get
in sometimes because the group felt GUILTY for telling us to get lost after
we spent 30 minutes porting them all there.  Now...

That feeling is NOT unanimous.  I would guess it's not even prevalent.
