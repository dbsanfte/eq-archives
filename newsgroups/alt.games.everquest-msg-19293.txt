They're all wrong.  Go be a P.C. merchant.  It's all about research,
patience-in-auctions and HONESTY.  Treat your buyers right, invest time
every week in auctioning your wares (of course, buy low - sell high), and
KNOW the price of the item from maximumeq.com before you buy or sell
anything.

Later,
