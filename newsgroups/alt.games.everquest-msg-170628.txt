OK, I'm new to this game and I've been reading a lot but I've never read
anything about a way to figure out exactly how far I am standing from a mob,
nor about what their aggro range is.  Maybe knowing how to figure this out
would help me live longer.

Would someone be so kind as to explain how you know exactly what a mob's
aggro range is, and what distance you're standing from them?

Thank you.
