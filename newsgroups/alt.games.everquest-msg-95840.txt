Yes in general I like the new models very much compared to
the old blocky models.

However, many of the animations suck, they need serious
work. The running animation for many models makes them look
like they have a stick up their ass. The need to do some motion
capture to get it right. They need to dump half of the social animations
to make room for better combat and running animations. I mean
that is what we see 90% of the time.

Many of the static poses of the characters seem odd or wrong to.
The sitting male barbarian pose makes shaman wan warriors stab
themselves through the torso, stupid looking. The female barbarian
standing pose, make them stab themselves in the face if they
have a long weapon like a spear.

I do think the gigantic breasts are a bit much. I like tits as much as
the next guy but come on, elves with double Ds? And even dark-elves?
