It does.   If you're quick about it, you can even get one in without hiding,
before the mob realizes you're there.

You can use it to good effect soloing casters.  Shamans were my favorite
targets, due to thier low nuking ability, low healing ability, and nice long
casting easily resisted debuffs.  As soon as they start to cast they won't
turn, so spin around to the back and unload.
