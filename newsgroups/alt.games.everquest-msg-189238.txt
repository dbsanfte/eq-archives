Saw the pilot episode of riverworld yesterday, it was probably the finest
piece of television I have seen since the show "Law and Order". Seemed like
Star Trek on a riverboat piloted by Samuel Clemens. I'm in awe of what that
could represent since it could be said that the show Star Trek in many ways
defined the last 30-40 years of society in making it worship technology.
Perhaps this show will help people realize what is really valuable and fun
about life, I certainly have forgotten.

Also the first TV show I have ever seen with nudity in it.

Seems like most of the people in these news groups that I am abusing would
like that show too.
