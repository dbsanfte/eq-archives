Actually, you just need to shrink yourself up good, and swim in past the 
rocks in Paineel.
Here's how EQAtlas describes it :
"The other way is through a small, locked boulder located in the area just 
past the newbie area in Paineel. You will need to be able to pick locks in 
order to open this, but evil races can purchase the key in Paineel for quite 
a large sum (around 100-120 pp). Also, smaller races or creatures (like wolf 
form or some illusions) can fit through the rocks with a little work, 
although they must be careful not to drown while doing so."

So not too hard, really.
