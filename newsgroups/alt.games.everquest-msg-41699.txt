Right.  Verant has said that hiding the server numbers is to keep
their competitors from getting too much information.  Whenever a new
game launches, the EQ server counts take a hit.  It happened with
Diablo II, it happened with AO, and it will happen with DAoC and the
games that come after that.

If the DAoC launch is followed by an immediate EQ server population
drop of 20%, it is a damn good bet that it is due to DAoC.  That would
give Mythic and any other EQ competitor or potential competitor a good
idea of how many people a new game can steal away from EQ.  That's
very valuable information.  Going beyond just looking at the server
total, if they actually logged on to EQ and did level and class
counts, they could get a lot more information.  From level counts,
they could figure out if the people who will take a leave from EQ to
try a new game are more likely to be high level or low level EQ
players.  From class counts, they can get ideas about what classes
people are least satisified with in EQ, and aim their game to take
those people.  If they look at the counts several times during the
day, they can get a reasonable idea of where their game has the best
chance of taking players from EQ.

I'm just an average guy with a simple math degree from Caltech.  Get
an actual statistician playing with the server count data, and a hell
of a lot more than I list above will be discoverable.
