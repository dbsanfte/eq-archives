They don't sue because it's not worth their time and money to go after
the small-time individuals. That doesn't mean they're giving approval
or giving up their right to sue if they wanted. :p I think their main
reason for saying "no" is so people don't expect them to get involved
in disputes over these transactions. The threat of a ban is more
effective than just them saying "Sorry, it's not our problem".

That said, I do think they need to nail Yantis' ass to the wall.  He
has done damage to the EQ community. :(
