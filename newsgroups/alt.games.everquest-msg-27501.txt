In a zone like sleepers, an enchanter won't be doing much.  I mean
other than right click on their snake on a stick and toss a clarity
here and there.  Oh yeah, they can tash the non-named junk and die
real fast.

Gotta be a DAMN big pinch since a fully buffed SK/Paladin with the
best gear possible won't last more than 3 seconds against some of the
"uber" mobs.

/disc defensive is the only thing that gives the clerics a chance to
get their heals off and even then getting that first CH to hit is
usually the most dangerous part of the encounter.

Clerics, yes.
Enchanter, usually you need one per raid--unless it's a BIG freaking
raid in which case for sanity purposes, get a couple.
