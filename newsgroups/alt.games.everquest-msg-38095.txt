Scifi settings are usually swayed heavily towards fantasy elements anyway.
Look at Star Trek, Star Wars, almost any established scifi setting.  The
vast majority of races are humanoids with oxygen-oriented respiration and
easily-comparable technology.  Whenever a ship's stardrive breaks down,
there's always a hospitable planet within a couple of hours' flight.  Most
treatments of high-tech fiction involve little to no science.
