Given enough people trying to get the first hit in, the mob will be
dead before you know who hit it first.  Even if it doesn't go down
that fast, the longer it lives the longer I have to wait for my shot
at it, so I'll want it dead quickly.

It's not, of course, rational behaviour not to group here even with
the system as described - since the whole group gets the important
reward (AIUI, no filthy Europeans allowed in the stress test so I'm
just speculating), being in a group would still help since only one
group member would need to be first.  Whether some other system would
help is something we can only speculate about, but where would the fun
be if we knew the answer?
