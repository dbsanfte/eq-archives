I started in the game around three weeks ago and created a female
Wood Elf Druid on Lanys  T`Vyl. I had hardly got out of the guild 
before guys were giving me stuff and I was getting buffs piled on me.
Twice guys have jumped in and saved her when she was getting hammered
by mobs and I got very embarrassed about it :-))
Have`nt played her for a while which is a pity because she was just
getting out of the newbie doldrums at lvl 6 and was getting some 
decent spells.

The male Wood Elf Druid I started to replace her has not done near
as well or my male Barbarian Shaman, so I have no doubts your friend
is correct in his assumptions, just it strikes me it might be a little
awkward if he ever wants to join a guild or something like that!
