Tier 2 is the zones like crypt of decay, Plane of valour, plane of storms,
to get into them you can either
1. do the quest found in one of the teir 1 zones

A: for valor and storms you go to plane of justice and do one of the trials
win u get both zones acess)
B: for Crypt of decay you go to Plane of Desise and talk to the wandering
ogre near the zone in,

2.  or for tier 2 just get level 62 (might be + or - 1 level ive forgottton
the exact number) and you will be auto allowed in

doing the quest has the nice bonus of making your Charm (you get in Plane of
tranquilty) get better stats
