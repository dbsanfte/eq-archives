Troll?  I am a regular at all 3 of these NG, hardly a troll.  Price checking
is one reason.  Electronic Boutique in my area meets prices if they can call
the store and validate the price and that they have it in stock.  Thus, I
bought dungeon Siege from Electronic Boutique for $15 because they price
matched Best Buy.  I did buy Civ 3 from Best Buy, but its a drop in the
bucket to how much business they have lost from me.  I'm sure most people
who buy computer games know about their bad rep.  Not being able to return
software is a huge reason not to buy software from them unless your certain
you won't return it.   Appearantly they also own Medea Play, which has the
same policy, so stay away from them also.
