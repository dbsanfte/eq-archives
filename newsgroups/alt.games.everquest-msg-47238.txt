Hi , Im going to re-format my hard drive, which obviously means a clean
re-install of everything but Im a bit worried about EQ. I understand that the
cd-key can only be used once so how would I do a clean install of EQ and the
expansions after formating my drive? when i go to install, it will ask for the
key and since i've used it once already surely it will be rejected?
I cant transfer the files to another drive, a zip drive or floppies.
Sorry if this has been covered before, but I need to know how to deal with
this.
Many thanks in advance.
