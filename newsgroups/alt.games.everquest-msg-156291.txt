Does anyone know what is the story with Peffin Ambersnow in EW?  I found her
hiding or invisible among the giants in their fort.  When I talked to her
she seemed kind of suspicious so I think she is a traitor.  She claimed she
was a prisoner but then she was invisible so I think not.  I looked at ala's
and everlore and couldn't find her.  Couldn't get her to say anything else
and she didn't drop anything (no cast, but many hp's, dark blue to a 54).
Seems like a fast respawn.
