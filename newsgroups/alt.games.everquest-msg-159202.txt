The faithstone is far MORE useful now that PoK is out.

Bind way out in the middle of nowhere near your fight spot, and when its time
to go, what good do those PoK portals do you?  You still have to run over hill
and dale, thru hostile territory, to get to a PoK portal.  Or click your
Faithstone, sell to the vendor, buy some bread, drop by the bank, buy more
symbol rocks, then zone out to BB where that PoK portal awaits, your port to
ANYWHERE.

Previously the faithstone was a handy access to a bank, but you'd end up
begging in BB or GFay for a port, or sitting in the GFay spires waiting for
port up, or taking a boat.. maybe to TD where you could swim firepots to
finally get to a destination city.  Now its near immediate access to the
fabulous PoK port system.
