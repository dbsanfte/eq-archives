Basically Catholics believe in "do onto others as you would have done onto
you". Pretty good philosophy if you ask me.
Catholics also believe in forgiveness for everything (the
get-out-of-jail-free card), that God will pass final justice on the sinner
when they die, and if they havent truely repented by then, its down below to
The Devil *DAH DAH-DAH DAH DAAAAN!*
This smacks of peasant control to me. Dont worry about your shitty masters,
they will get what they deserve when they die.
I dont know about the rest of Christianity, just the Catholic part.

Anyway, signing out now...Im off to alt.religion.catholic to vent some more
pent up anger at my forced Catholic upbringing.
