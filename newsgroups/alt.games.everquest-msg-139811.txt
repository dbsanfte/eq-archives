}It has to do with the nature of gate travel and the relative atmospheres

}atmosphere you would be decelerating in an environment which your body

}as they do now, you must be on Luclin to use them, as such a gate does
}not pose the same problems in that you don't actually leave the
}atmosphere of the moon during the gate.

Hmm... an interesting idea... but I'm bound in nexus.  So why don't I get 
caught in a death loop whenever I die in Norrath or gate home?
