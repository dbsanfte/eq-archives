Thanks, that's worth looking into. I already have two pairs of Opal 
Steins on my main and mule, and I was looking into which gem would give 
me the best ratio. I'll try Peridots, and then I'll try Rubies as Sean 
suggested. Perhaps I'll lose less money on one big gem than on many 
cheaper ones.

Speaking of which... I messed up with the trading mode last night, and 
sold a Raw Diamond for 10pp :( /em kicks self

But yeah... I'm so low on cash these days I cannot afford KEI, let alone 
recompense a cleric properly for a rez. :(
