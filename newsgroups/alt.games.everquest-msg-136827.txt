This isn't new and doesn't really have anything to do with removing
the 10% penalty.  It's been brewing for awhile now and came to a head
a few months ago when a bunch of people got together on The Druids
Grove (I think) and came up with that silly ass Druids petition.  You
might remember the zombie thread it spawned, which was the first time
myself and Mr. hughes had this discussion.  This whole thing is just a
rehash.

I think a concept guide would only get Verant in more trouble than it
would be worth.  Any deviation from the 'guide' would call down
legions of anal-retentive, hyper-obsessive nimrods to bitch and moan
about how Verant is trying to screw X class because they aren't
following said guide slavishly.
