My post refers to the official website which does not provide the info you
mention. As for in game info, YOU might have seen it mentioned but I did
not. So now, I must rely on games players instead of VI for the basic info.
They can take the time to post system wide messages with useless info but
not for anything usefull.
No doubt your response will be a flame. Thats what you mostly do, flame
people. You think no-one has a right to post an opinion, or if they do, you
feel some inner need have your say too.
What leads you to post a pointless post in response to a pointless post.
I presume you feel that VI's after-sales service is excellent, and feel the
need to defend them.
If that is that case then present a considered arguement that contradicts my
post, not a "There's a patch. You can't play. Deal."
