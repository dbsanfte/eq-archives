No, I didn't. I cannot name anyone I've ever known who has enjoyed
client/internet/server lag endemic to internet games. You can code cheats
to get by it in most situations, but when playing tag, it just doesn't
work.

Dunno if this is still a topic for debate, but during beta, one of the
biggest problems in PvP was melee players being totally unable to kill
anyone because it was so easy to avoid being hit, and most people who
played melee classes begged for "sticky melee" which allowed them to glue
themselves onto a running opponent's tail so they couldn't use latency or
cheap ghosting tricks to escape.
