   Ooh!  That's another thing I forgot about.  In RL, I have a rather deep voice
for a woman (it runs in my family.  My brother and father both sound like
talking tuba's).  Lenny has a somewhat high voice for a man.  In the last 18
years that we've been together, several of our speech patterns and such have
become similar.  Over the phone, we have been know to accidentally fool even his
own mother.  If we were actually talking in a party, everyone would accuse us of
being a two boxer!
