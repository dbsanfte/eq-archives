Hmm, I've been asking around in game and it would appear that for a
fletcher/archer type, high dex is rather a nice thing to have. Granted that,
when in melee, you wish you had more ac or str, but when intentionally going
out to fletch or bowkite, high dex seems to increase your chances for
success in both skills. On a related note, some have mentioned that str also
influences the max amount of dmg per arrow.

I have, however, not found any conclusive proof in favour or against this.
