My bad, I'm doing this in between tech support calls for a piece of crap, 
non-standard, DHCP/DNS GUI software that is requiring me to renew my lease 
and killing my SSH sessions, so I'm not really spending enough time on 
this.  Hopefully this is a bit clearer.

For melee type:
Bind in a convenient spot, where there is a REVIVE capable person camped.
Fight normally.
When you are ready to leave, have the revive person log on at your bind 
point.
Die to a mob, either go up and whack a mob, or wait until after you get 
wiped out naturally (happens often enough as a bard).  You have 3 hours on 
this corpse, so it's not critical to move quickly yet.
Tell cleric you're ready to call it a night, and to hold off your rez 
until you give the OK.
Tell cleric to be ready, and duel pally or other person at your bind 
point.
Die, repop right there, on top of your nekkid corpse.
Tell cleric to rez you NOW!
As soon as you load, loot your cleric-rezzed corpse ASAP.
This should take about 60-90 seconds depending on how fast you zone and 
loot.  
Tell Pally to REVIVE you NOW! 
You will now pop up over your naked, no-exp loss corpse.  

Hopefully this clarifies the issue, if not, I'll try again.
