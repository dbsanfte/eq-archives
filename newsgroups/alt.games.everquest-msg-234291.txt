As of the Dev Chat two nights ago - which I was dialed into and participated
in - Leadership points do NOT cost any XP the way AA points do.  You get
them for being leader of a group or a raid, period.

That being said - yes, I hear plenty of pickup group problems coming up
where I form the group (the norm for me) and someone else insists on being
the group leader for the leadership points.  I already have an answer
planned and will probably put it on a macro key: "I formed the group, I'm
the leader.  If you want leadership points, form your own group."

Amusingly enough, 90 percent of my grouping time is done with the same six
folks, and it's almost always my love who starts the group on his cleric.  I
anticipate a lot of clerics running around with a bazillion group-leadership
AA.
