Well Jewelry was like that till you enchanted the metal... enchanting
basically meant you broke even most of the time after failures. And even at
250 skill, it was too slow to make money to be worthwhile. So it doesn't
hurt that much I guess. Sucks a little though.

I've got a 200 pottery skill. I think most of the time if it wasn't
something a player would buy I just trashed anything I made without firing
it (firing trivials so low it is silly).
