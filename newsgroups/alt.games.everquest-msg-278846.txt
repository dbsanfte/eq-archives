   First off hello to you all. I don't have a computer but I'm getting
one soon. My wife and I both play the pen and paper version and we love
it. We are looking forward to playing the computer game as well so my
question is this.... I know that I'll have to buy the game for my
computer, so how much is the game and how much does it cost to play
online? Also can you just play solo on your computer or is it an online
game only?
Thanks in advance.
