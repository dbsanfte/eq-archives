It's to save time, nothing more than that. We didn't know about this
'trick', but if we had, who knows. We knew about the range bug on necro
spells and never used that, so probably not, but that's because we don't
tend to use 'cheesy' tactics, rather than some huge morality platform.

Was it an exploit? Yup. They got caught red handed, and don't really
have a leg to stand on about it's 'legitimacy'

But...

This was not (IMO) an instant suspension event. You can tread the party
line about 'breaking any law and paying the price' but a certain degree
of common sense has to be used, especially in a zone where the majority
of the bugs are detrimental to the players. VI has done nothing to fix
them, despite having the infomation for months on resisted AEs still
hitting every time: laughably substandard loot making up over 50% of
loot tables, wierd buggy wall/floor agro, spontaneous zone crashing for
no reason. There was no need to be so 'anally retentive' about it, when
a simple: GM shouts, 'This method of pulling isn't allowed, please don't
do it again or you'll be suspended. This is your final warning on the
matter' would have adequately sufficed.

From personal experience in VT, I can tell you that all they did was cut
through a few hours of crawling through mobs with bugged AEs, and maybe
avoiding a wipeout from a bugged warping pull, maybe avoided a efw
people running back for a corpse summon after being summoned into a wall
and falling through the world. By killing the mob they did, they
probably removed a few warders (blockages to make you do the zone
linearly), so they didn't have to spend 20 mins killing miniboss mobs,
often dropping Sebilis level loot, sometimes with bugged hps so they
take 1.5 hours of constant fighting to kill.

The mob they pulled, was killed in exactly the same manner as if they'd
spent 6 hours fighting to it. There are no adds in the room he spawns
in. There is no difference in the actual fight itself. This is where it
differs wildly from Dain, when fighting him in the 'well', both protects
from lots of adds, and more importantly, also totally negates his
powerful banish effect. Their actions in now way reduced or trivialised
the fight itself, only skipping the trash clearance.
