There's a pretty good (I think) web page about grouping, which is
linked from the alt.games.everquest FAQ web site
(http://www.icynic.com/~don/EQ/age.faq.htm); it's called "Grouping
101:  How to make friends and get lotsa lewt" and is available at:

http://www.icynic.com/~don/EQ/grouping101.htm

It describes the usual "roles" of the EQ classes, (puller, tank, crowd
control, healer, etc.) and the best tactics for group members to work
well together.
