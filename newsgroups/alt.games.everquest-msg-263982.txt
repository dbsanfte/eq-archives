Yeah.  It was wonderful getting on, spending an hour getting a group,
then trying to figure out where to go... "oh yeah the blah is camped,
lets go here, oh yeah that's camped, oh I know a great spot 5 zones
away...".  

I also miss not getting any loot because I can't stick around for 5
hours till the group broke up.

LDoN was the best thing that ever happened to the game.  Easy to get a
group, you actually HAD to move thru the dungeon instead of sitting in
one place forever, the time was limited so those of us who have a life
outside of EQ could enjoy relatively short periods of play.  

Sure, doing LDoN after LDoN is repetitive, but you guys are thinking
fondling of stuff like the orc highway that's been in the game
forever... hardly huge excitement.

Different strokes for different folks.
