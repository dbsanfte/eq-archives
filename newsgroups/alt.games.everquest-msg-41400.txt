Except that the power difference per level decreases as your level
gets higher. A level 16 may in fact be able to soundly and regularly
beat a level 15 but the outcomes are much less predetermined at higher
levels because the power difference is less not more. At higher levels
how you have chosen to develop and use your skills will have a bigger
effect on the outcome as well as who you are with and what skills they
bring to the table.
