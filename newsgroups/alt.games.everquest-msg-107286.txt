Ok.  You officially have no idea what you're talking about.

At 54, Clerics get kinda close to druids in nuking ability with a 670
point damage nuke for 250 mana, which is close to druids Scoriae which
is 250 mana for 688 points of damage.  Druids QUICKLY regain the edge
in nuking though at level 56 when they get Breath of Karana, which is
250 mana for 812 points of damage.  They keep widening the gap until
level 60 where a driud will be nuking for 1100 points of damage for a
measly 250 mana.  Clerics best UNDEAD nuke (not counting they're
Banish Undead spell, which works like druids Banish Summoned spell, no
exp, no loot, and costs a star ruby to cast) is only 250 mana for 750
damage.

Clerics are way, way, WAY behind druids in nuking power.
