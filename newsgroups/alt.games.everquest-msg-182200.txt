<snip about camping>
To my knowledge there is no such thing as a 'camp' in the GM's eyes, 
just a logic thing for players, while they do recognize KS (Kill 
Stealing) they don't recognize someone else moving in on a camp.

   But I've been watching some other threads here

That's exactly it, merely politeness, try going to Paludal caverns or 
Lake of Ill Omen(so I've heard) and you'll see the worst behavior on or 
off Norath, go to another zone, like Crushbone or Highhold and you'll 
see people behaving a bit more polite.  Dunno what it's like up at the 
60's only having a 36 cleric, but this is my experience.
