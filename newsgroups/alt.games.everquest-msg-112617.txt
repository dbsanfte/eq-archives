My dwarf Paladin always carries:

   5 pieces of +CHA gear
   6 pieces of +WIS gear
   3 pieces of +MR gear
   5 spare weapons (1HB, 2HB, 1HS, 2HS, 2HP)

And in the bank, I have a full 10-slot backpack
of +FR gear, another full 10-slot backpack of
+CR gear, and a third full 10-slot backpack of
+WIS gear (in addition to the 5 I carry).
