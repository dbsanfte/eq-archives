And, after making and playing around with the dye for a couple of
weeks, I can say with authority that it's a bit of a pain to get all
your armor to look good together if the base colors are very
different. What looks good on a piece with a brownish base looks
awful over a light blue base, etc.
 However, if you play with the RGB sliders a bit to compensate for
that, you can make yourself look pretty snazzy =)
