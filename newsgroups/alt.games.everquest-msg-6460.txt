You have a very lenient idea of it then.  Robbing, carrying away forcibly,
plundering, despoiling...that is your idea of <just> "use and abuse".  Go
into court after having kidnapped someone and tell the judge "I was just
using and abusing her Your Honor...no biggie...can I go now?"  "Are you sure
you want to press charges sir...he was only broke into your place to use and
abuse your property...no harm done."

Oh and I like how you conviently felt it appropriate to leave off the 4th
definition, which when you as the average person "Hey...what's the
definition of rape?" you get something along the lines of...

> > > > >4) illicit sexual intercorce without consent and effected by force

(My Webster's has it at number 2 by the way.)

"Sorry maam...he didn't mean you no harm...that's just a little Southern
style use and abuse.  Woooeeee..."

Bottom line...it's a little serious than using and abusing...
