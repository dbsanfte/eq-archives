I'm looking for  afew good fansites, as the official site runs liek
crap on my PC, when it runs at all (stupid Flash..).

I've just preordered, and am looking for info on classes, races,
gameworld, etc.  I never played EQ so it's all new to me.

Also, how is the best way to look into getting into a guild/org ?

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
