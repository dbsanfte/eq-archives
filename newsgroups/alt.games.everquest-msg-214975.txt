So the new computer is finally a happy thing. It's connecting to the
internet (finally) amd to SWG (finally) and to EQ (finally, finally!).
There's just one little final quirk that, honestly, is driving me crazy.
I sped up the mouse settings just a touch when we first got the new comp
because, frankly, it was set to "molasses." The faster setting seems to
take in all programs except EQ, where it reverts to molasses. This makes
fast targeting impossible at times. Is there anything I can do to give
my mouse speed a boost in EQ? Do I need to install a cyber-cat of some
sort to threaten it?  ;)

System is Win XP, mouse is a Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer, user is
frustrated.

Thanks in advance, all!
