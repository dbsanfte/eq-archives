IIRC, Brad admitted that kiting was unforseen.  Of course, he also
admitted that pulling was unforseen (how could they not realize that
players would lead their enemies into an ambush), and that camping
was unforseen (again, how long have hunters been setting up ambushes
on game trails, at salt licks, at watering holes, etc...  animal
predators do these things!).

I suspect you are correct about this.  Though I would add Wizards and
Druids to the list as expected to solo some mobs via root/nuking in the
original plan.  And Enchanters, with their weak pet + buffs + weak
nukes.

Again, I suspect that you've nailed this one.

Don't forget the new group bonuses.  On Stromm, where you didn't see the
group buff bug in play due to the newness of the server, I've seen:
Druid_792 shouts, '34 Druid looking for group to get xp bonus'
in a nearly empty (8 players) Rathe Mountains of all places.
