> Thoughts?

If you were to chart the sales of the following items:

Sales of Brittany Spears CDs
Sales of Mozart CDs

or:

Pepsi
Vintage Bordeaux

I wonder what the data would look like and what conclusions people would 
draw from them.

Every month, Consumer Reports reports on their opinions of what's best for 
things like stereo and video equipment and I invariably choke on the 
recommendations, because the criteria they are looking at have little to do 
with what drives me to these products (although it may be VERY relevant to 
someone else). The numbers assembled by all these reports are very 
interesting and useful in their own ways, but it's useful to keep in mind 
that they don't always reveal the qualities of interest to any particular 
individual. Similarly, subscriber numbers don't necessarily reflect the 
qualities of interest to any particular MMOG'er, like relative quality of 
quests in one game over another, or the prevalence of griefers and 
exploiters in one or another.
