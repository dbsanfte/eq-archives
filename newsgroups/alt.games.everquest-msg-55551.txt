Might want to hang around the events a bit longer, here's a couple things
I've gotten:

A sceptre (sceptre of ancient knowledge? can't recall)
WIS: 8
INT: 8
MANA: 25
+5 to all resists (Yum!)
Prim, sec, no melee stats, CLR, DRU, SHM

An Idol (pretty sure this is called Idol of the Wayward Spirit)
AC: 10
WIS: 9
MANA: 30
+ 15 to disease resists
Prim, sec, no melee stats (duh), CLR, DRU, SHM

A belt (again, can't remember name)
Uh, can't remember stats either, think it was AC 6, WIS 5 and
some resists (Magic, maybe?)
CLR, DRU, SHM

Pegasus Feathered Headdress?
AC: 4
WIS: 4
MANA: 4
+4 to disease resist
CLR, DRU, SHM
Looks like a Nightshade Wreath

Not wearing this, but hey, I kilt the sucker, it's mine!

Some necklace, which I can't remember anything about, doh!

And the aforementioned earring from RM (Common off a named horse)
the something Mare, I think.

Sceptre and Idol dropped off KeVagon the Dreadful in EK, idol
drops pretty commonly. Also seen the idol drop off the WW overlord
and the huge snake in NRo.

Betcha Tiru can use some of those... Another drop that's pretty
sought after is a WAR only sword with, uh, Shock of Spikes? some
mage DD as a proc.

Also seen a nice cowl for rogues, and some other random WAR and ROG
drops. (WAR belt with STA, WAR neck with resists, for instance)

Another nice item I've seen is a monk tunic, 20AC, +10 to resists
(All I think, can't remember. Was some important resists, at least)
We let a monk loot this, and he gave us a netted kelp tunic as
thanks.

Doh, reading through Gary's post, I see he included the stats on the
cleric belt, seems I'm not paying attention...
