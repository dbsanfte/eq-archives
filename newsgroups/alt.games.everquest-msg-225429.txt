=) i have a baby rogue [am at 32] and i pickpocked during the 
fighting..i start before firhting with a quick run of PP, disarm and 
backstab then autofight. I have a 1hp in primary, and 1hs in secondary.

Periodically in the fight i click off autofight and pickpocket, then go 
back to fighting=)

i have PP up to 112, and in general i get 2 or 3 successes per fight
