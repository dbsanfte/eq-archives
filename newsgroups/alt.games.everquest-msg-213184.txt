I'm starting a new Druid and am now up to level 24.  I started the
usual 1 to 12 in the typical zones but when I got to 13 I went to
Unrest.  I found that here I got more exp for a blue than a red in
most other zones.  At 19 I headed to Paudal Caverns.  Here, also, I
get more exp for a blue than a dark red in OT (I went from lvl 19 to
24 in one night).  What other zones have this extreme experience
bonus?  I'm starting to outgrow PC so am searching for the next zone
that has this same kind of bonus.  Does anyone have any suggestions on
a zone for getting to lvl 29 in a day?  Also, does anyone have any
stats on what the experience bonuses are for these zones?  I know that
they must exist because because I get more than 1 blue bubble for a
dark blue in Paudal and just under 1 blue bubble for a red in OT (even
though it takes about 10 times more time in fighting and mana regen).
