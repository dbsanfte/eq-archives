Only hide, no sneak.  Will work about 50% of the time. And will never
work when you want it to.

Don't be a high elf mage, they are kinda creepy

I wouldn't even consider the night blindness an issue, we get summon
heatstone at what, level 16?  Can cast while on CR or whatever. It
shouldn't even be considered.

The obvious answer is GNOME, agnostic if possible.  But if want a
diety, go with Solesek Ro, at least then get some cool cultural
jewelery and stuff.

Erudite mages prolly have the best hunting area, once get past level 8
or so. Warrens, Stonedblunt Mountains, Kerra Ridge (already kos there,
kill em all).  And noone, and I mean, NOONE hunts out there, ideal for
the soloing mage.  I should know, I soloed my gnome mage in the area
from 8 to 35.  Disadvntage of erudite starting area, its by far the
toughest area for a level 1-4
