    Re: this, it makes sense to me.  I haven't seen any field-test results
but according to game mechanics it should last longer.  The reason?  Druids
get a series of root spells that get higher-and-higher level.  One would
that the higher-level the root spell is the more effective it is against a
target (similar to the higher-level poison/disease cures that druids also
get).  Again, though, I've seen no data.  You being a Cleric too, test your
level 4 root vs. the Druid's 20+ grasping root series and see if it lasts
longer or if the added damage to the root is just a fringe benefit.

P.S. Sounds like you've got good knowledge of tanks/chanters too.  You'll go
far in life.  =D
