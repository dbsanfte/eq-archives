Last night I made up a word.

Ninjanerf.

As in:

[Tue Oct 22 23:59:26 2002] <SYSTEMWIDE_MESSAGE>: Ariehlle-the-Archer : 
Greetings, Antonious Bayle and all U.S. servers will be coming down at 3 am 
PST for maintenance. Please plan accordingly.
[Wed Oct 23 00:00:11 2002] You say to your guild, 'I notice it is 
"maintenance" and not "emergency patch" or "ninjanerf"'

Please use this word as you see fit.

"I'm constantly forgetting my own phone number. Quite simply, 
it's because I never call myself. (I used to, but I was never
home. I just gave up after a while. I figure if I want to talk
to me, I'll just have to do it in person.)" -Walker
