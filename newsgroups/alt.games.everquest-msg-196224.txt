Nurga / Droga is awful for PLing. Aggro radius is huge at the level
where it's appropriate to XP there. You can get chain aggro chain
casting that will kill you pretty damned fast. Oh, and if you're not
real careful, they'll eat your PLer, too. I used to camp the cheif
room in Droga for faction with a 65 rogue / 57 cleric combo and would
routinely end up rezzing level 60+ farmers who had gotten in over
their heads.

I tried PLing my warrior there. It did not go well.
