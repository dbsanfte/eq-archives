Just watch where you are kiting them. Spend some time observing the
wisps. They follow very set, predictable paths. If you attack one at a
given spot, you can rest assured that another will be along on that path
shortly if nobody else ganks it first. Snare/dot them and pull them well
away from their normal paths. (Right up the hillside to the edge of the
zone and along there is a good bet.)

The key to fighting in the commons is to "fight where the add ain't."
