Sol A and lava :0 you know whats coming....

well I've LD'd into the lava once now and it was a real pain in the ass to
get it back, luck was with me and a nekro went on a hlaf hour walk to buy a
coffin for me and summoned my corpse.
What i was wondering was if i Fell into the lava through my own stupidity,
or lagged into it, how do i get out? can i swim down stream to a point where
i can jump out? does such a place exist?

Not trying to start any flames here, i know its stupid to fall in, but this
is just a what if post.

Any idea's always welcome
