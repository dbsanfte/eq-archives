Interdependency was a great thing for the crafting community, it brought 
people together and made them chat and trade etc. Without it you just have 
people churning out items on their own. I've lost count of the number of 
people I have met and made deals with through the system.

There were problems with interdependency without a doubt but to totally go 
against everything you have been saying since the game was released is bad 
form in my opnion. SoE made a big deal of the crafting system and now they 
have totally changed it.

Why didnt they simply fix the sage class instead of hitting the explode 
button?

Alchemists are now a pretty useless class.

1. Potions/Posions : Do u know how these sell? They dont sell for shit, 
nobody wants them because they are so poor. I know lots of alchemists and 
none of them can sell this stuff.

2. Fighter Upgrades: Due to the insane number of Adept drops these not 
exactly popular. Will SoE fix this aspect of the game, I doubt it. Without 
decay you will end up with 100000's of the same player crafted items on the 
market (not as good as mob drops), which will lower the price so much they 
become worthless.

SoE did have a great system in place that was getting better, instead of 
sticking to it and just tweaking it, they swung the nerf bat and TOTALLY 
went against everything they had previously said.
