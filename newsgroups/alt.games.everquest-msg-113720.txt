Anyone notice that the graphic on the bard drums have changed?  I read
on castersrealm that they changed the graphic on test but I didn't
think they were going to implement the graphic change so soon.  I was
playing after the large patch yesterday and when I panned out I
noticed my drums looked like a drum instead of a stick.  I also
noticed that my bard was playing the drum like a drum, instead of
strumming it like a lute.  I know this change is not nearly as major
as the other changes but I thought this was long overdue.

Also, have a question regarding hunting.  My bard is level 35 and
right now I want to stick to dungeons because I don't want to go the
Kunark route (LOIO, Frontier, Overthere, Dreadlands).  I have nothing
against anyone that chooses to go that route, I just want to become
more experienced in dungeons.  I enjoy the challenge in dungeons.  Can
anyone give me good tips for hunting in dungeons in regards to
grouping?  I've died more in dungeons than I have outdoors.  I've also
noticed that it's difficult to get in a pick-up group in dungeons. 
Can anyone suggest a dungeon where there is a high population?  Lower
Guk in general has been good for the most part, but sometimes it's
hard for me to get a group in there at 35th.  Sol B has been good when
there are people in there, but I find that empty most of the time as
well.  Any ideas or suggestions will be appreciated.
