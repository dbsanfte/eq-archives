Yes, you are entirely correct.  

Hand to Hand is the skill used to hit opponents when you have no
weapon equipped, or with certain weapons (are any druid
weildable?) that function in the same way.  Using the skill will
result in skill ups.

But you are correct in more ways than just that one... when you
say its a skill you need to work on -like- 1hs etc.  Because as a
druid, your need to work on those skills is pretty much
nonexistent, in the long run you won't need those skills at all. 
At low levels, they are useful, but as you level up, mob AC and
HP totals will rise far faster than you will be able to keep up
with, particularly as you are capped at learning 4 points of
skill per level and max capped at 175 or so, while the real melee
classes are learning at 5 points per level with a much higher max
cap, and getting a damage bonus to each swing, and getting double
attack and dual weild and... well suffice it to say that at level
50 a warrior with the same weapon you are weilding will be doing
four times the damage per minute... probably more, and warriors
are among the least effective damage producing melee classes.

As a druid, you'll do far more damage casting a damage producing
spell, then sitting down and meditating the mana back faster; and
you'll have a host of spells ranging from snare to root to buffs
to heals that don't do any damage at all but are still a far
better use of your time than standing next to the target and
swinging any weapon (or none at all, in the case of Hand to Hand)

And if thats not enough, I think that the lack of available
weapons for the hand to hand skill and the lack of a serious HtH
table for most classes makes it the worst of all melee skills to
use; if you -want- to hit things, do so with a weapon.  Monks and
Beastlords are the only classes that really have much use for the
skill even though its available to all, and I've seen some
warriors who make a point of maxing it out as well so they have
at least some kind of damage output when naked getting back to
their body.

I'd advise picking just one weapon skill, preferably a one handed
one so you can have a second item with stats in your off hand,
and using it during your low levels, you'll outgrow weaponry
altogether soon enough, and won't have wasted so much time.  At a
guess, go for 1hs since thats the skill used by your epic,
assuming you eventually get it... and then you'll be set for
using your scimitar to slaughter level 15 spiders and bears for
their silks and pelts if you don't want to waste the mana on
them.
