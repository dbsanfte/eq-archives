They drop still, just very rarely. My Shaman got 2 while hunting up
the white pelts for his newb armor.

>>Also where is the best place to get HQ bear pelts, I killed over 50
>>brown bears in East Karana and no HQ pelts

The tougher the monster the more likely it is to drop the good stuff,
all things being even.

The tougher spiders in NK, drop more spider silk, more often than the
weaker spiders. The bears in Nedirias Landing (sp?) are very tough
compaired to the bear cubs and bears around the old world, but drop HQ
pelts much more often. Though they are probably too tough for the OP
to fight just yet.
