Yes, you still lose a little money, but gems tend to come the closest to 100%, particularly if both characters have a
relatively high charisma (106+ does it in most cases) and are using vendors of their own race and good faction.  Gems are
also light weight and come in stacks of 20, and (from gem vendors) are available in unlimited quantities.

Selling gems purchased from vendors to players in the bazaar wouldn't work out very well in most cases; there are a few
"drop only" gems that will fetch a pretty penny from players, but these don't tend to be available on vendors, only there
if someone sold them to that vendor earlier.  While I have made a few thousand PP buying some of those gems and reselling
them, this is an entirely different operation than I'm talking about for quick and easy money transfer.
