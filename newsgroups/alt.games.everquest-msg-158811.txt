Well, not exacly top tier...  the group that I raid with also uses a DKP
system.

Spells are treated the same as any other drop, and auctioned to the raid.
The only extra rule on them is that you must be able to memorize the spell
in order to bid.  If nobody is able to bid, then they are placed in the raid
bank, and may be bid on by those not on the raid who are able to memorize.
