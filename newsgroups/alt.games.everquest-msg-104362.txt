Mobs con based on level, not on their combat skills, casting abilities
or total HPs. Some mobs are easier than others. The trick is finding
the ones that con the highest and are the easiest to kill :-P.

Casting mobs are the WORST in EQ. They have tons of mana, extremely
fast mana regen, and are extremely hard to interupt (hitting them
isn't enough you need a stun, slam, or bash). All casting mobs are
tougher than they con.
