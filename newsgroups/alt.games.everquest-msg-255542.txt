Yes, the group able to work together is a major factor too. I
have bailed out of (non LDoN) groups where there was an obvious
tension and/or one or more "problem child." ... You kinda get the
"bad vibes" and realize something is too likely to go wrong
because they wont work together. Makeup some excuse and leave.

In LDoN, once started even if I start getting the "Bad Vibes" I
stick with the group but find myself wishing it were over
quickly... unless they do an "unforgivable sin." Despite that,
the percentage of "bail outs" is actually tiny. I think Ive
actually bailed out of three or four LDoNs total.
