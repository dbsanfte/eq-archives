It's been a long time since I did this part of the epic (Ranger but
shared with Druid a lot of the way) and I just kept handing in
batwings until I got bored after Alrik refused to speak with me.   I
believe I did approximately 1000-1500 before going back to OOT.

He doesn't especially care for many class/race combinations - it's
unlikely to be anything you did wrong.
