That's what a friend and I are doing.  In EQ, he was one of the "play as
efficiently as possible, optimize everything, get in an uberguild, and be
the first in the game to do new content" crowd.  In DAoC, he spent a lot of
time switching charcters, each time he'd figure out a "better" way to do
something.  I never was like that, but did spend a lot of time reading fan
sites, trying to find out the nuts and bolts of things.

In CoH, neither of us has looked at any fan sites.  Hell, I haven't even
looked at the manual. :-)  I'm playing it as a newbie hero from some
background that makes me ignorant of the ways of the city...I have powers,
an inate sense of right and wrong, and a do-good attitude, and I'll learn
the ropes out on the streets, bringing evil-doers to justice, defending the
weak, the poor, the downtrodden.

(Gonna have to take a look at the manual soon...I remember something telling
me what the distinction is between training enhancements and other
enhancements, but I don't recall it, have failed to figure it out, and have
a bunch of training enhancements I need to figure out what to do with)

If we can figure out which is the role play server, we might even go there.
(I've heard Victory and I've heard Virtue).
