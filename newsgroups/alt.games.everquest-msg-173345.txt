Quad kiting is also a waste of time.

Snare a blood raven.  Charm it.  Haste it.  Pull any nearby mob to the wall
with snare.  Sic pet on mob.  DS pet.  Reapply charm as  needed till both mobs
are near death.  If your pet seems to be losing, help out a bit.  Once target
is dead, break charm, root mob, kill with DOT (there shoulnd't be much left of
the mob anyway).

Two mobs dead in a fairly short time, and druid is nearly FM when done.

Depending on the mobs you may get two or three other mobs down before your pet
is dead, using that plan you also help out via mana free dots and even
(depending on mana regen) spending mana on the targets.

The only faster way I've seen to get exp is a good AE group... those seem to
be hard to find though, and I can't think what they would want with a druid.
