While I agree with you in theory, it's not quite so clear-cut in 
practice. I also heard the first 9/11 jokes within hours of the attack, 
and I felt rather offended. I can certainly see how people can use humor 
to get over traumatic situations, I do that myself, but there is also 
value in *not* sharing your jokes at the wrong time, no matter how funny 
they may be. Being of a clownish nature, I've learned this the hard way.
