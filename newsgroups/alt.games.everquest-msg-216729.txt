While I haven't had an LD problem, I HAVE seen that problem (server being
slow to realize you are gone).  I finished a kill in PoD recently, went up
on the zone wall to med, cast improved invis, sat down, and then decided to
camp.  I typed "/camp desktop", then decided not to wait and typed "/q".

When I came back several hours later and logged in, my improved invis
immediately left, and I was also no longer levitating like I'd been.  I'm
pretty sure I had at least 30 minutes left on my O'Keil's Levity (the lev I
use), and improved invis is something like 11 minutes (with my focus items)
of invis, so it sure looks like it took a while for the server to notice I
was gone.
