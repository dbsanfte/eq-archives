We did Seru twice not long ago,both times he were up for several days.
That was on SolRo,one of the oldest servers with a lot of Seru capable
guilds.

Dont know about HGs in RM,but Ice giants in EF on SolRo are NOT
camped anymore 24 hours a day.

Spent some time there lately to hunt cats for HQ pelts to raise
tailoring,took me around 3 evenings with my baby Ranger on AB
to get enough HQ pelts,besides some offline-macroing-foragers I
was the only person in the zone for the whole time.
My trader is sitting on 600 spider silks,which are unsellable
for 5p for 2 weeks now,another hint what happens to the server
population.

Some other hints:

16 players in PoK on AB in the afternoon some days ago.
Impossible now to build a 50ies group from lfg list,often my
53 Rng is the only one on the lfg list with show matches activated.
Griegs End deserted,used to be a zone since it was hotspot,where
you had a chance to find a pickupgroup,now most of the time I
check it with my 53 Rng noone there.
Few players in WoS the last 2 or 3 weeks on SolRo,often less 
than 6,people used to name it the new "BoT".

As mentioned in my earlier post,SOE really shoot themselves
in the knee with the release of EQ2,would they have taken the
money they invested in the developement of EQ2 to make EQ1
competable against WoW,they would have one (me) customer
more.  :)
I doubt I will buy another SOE game in the foreseeable future.
Dont take me wrong,I liked EQ1 much,I played it for 4 years with
only 1 break for half a year,and its unlikely that I would have
switched to WoW,I am attached to my characters zoo :),but as it is
now, the game is simply unplayable due to the lack of fellow gamers.

Meldur (waiting for the european release of WoW)
