Nope it wasn't sarcasm.   the statue is slowable, which makes for an
immediatly easier battle (before then he hits *fast* for 1.1k though)  you
have more time to react, more time to cheal

As long as you can keep your MA up long enough to get Statue slowed, its
just a matter of "walking" him up and down the arena (or where ever you
pull) and everybody whacking him from behind.

Vindi hits for less, has a lot less HP, but isn't slowable..

the reason i see statue as easier - when we kill Vindi, we can expect 2-3
deaths on a decent pull.. when we pull statue, its a flawless kill (not even
MA/tasher or slower dead)
We have several 60 shamans in the guild (well maybe 4 or 5) but we have done
Statue more then once with just 1 60 shaman, so you don't need a whole army
of them

btw if you do ever try statue.. pick your pull spot well.  his death pops
the AoW, who will first wipe you all out, then camp your bodies for an hour
