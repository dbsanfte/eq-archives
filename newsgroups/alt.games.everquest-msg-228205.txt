The theory hasn't been proven invalid by history at all. There's
actually been strong evidence it IS valid but, as the author points
out, thet overwhelming popularity of EQ is causing other developers to
shift towards its style, in the style of computer gaming companies in
all genres.

Your claim that "it didn't work there, either" in reference to MUDs is
also questionable at best and outright wrong at worst.

Outright and 100% wrong. World elements are exactly what some mmorpgs
need. The problem is the player who likes world elements is rarely the
same player as who likes gamey elements. Of course the gamey players
don't understand the worldly players at all and think their opinions
aren't worth listening to.

We HAVE our gamey mmorpgs now - EQ and its clones. The numbers are
proving that the clones simply aren't as popular as EQ, which shows us
that those who want their gamey mmorpgs HAVE them. The numbers who
have *tried* mmorpgs that wanted worldly elements show that the demand
is there, but implementation has been off. It was the worldly elements
that drew people to DAoC and it had the best opening numbers of any
mmorpg until SWG. It later switched focus to gamey elements and growth
dropped off until it sat at its current level, where its been for at
least a year. SB wanted worldly elements and it had huge hype, and
then it released in a pitiful state with no real idea what it was
getting into, and most those people again had to go home disappointed.
This time, there was no gamey element to take up the slack and SB
languishes with a tiny playerbase.

Meanwhile UO shards with the worldly elements intact continue to go
strong despite being based on a game engine what, eight years old?

Your claim that you know what players want better than they do is
noted, but its not worth much. For some people, playing in a world is
itself part of the fun even if its missing "gamey elements", and the
"gamey elements" actually detract from that (witness the large scale
complaints about travel being too easy now in EQ - those who are
making that complaint are the ones with some understanding of how a
"world" can be as fun as a "game"). Don't try to foist your playing
style on other people.

You're not demonstrating any ability to understand it, then. If you
can't tell the difference between RvR and random ganking, you're being
deliberately obstinate.

On other issues.
