Its not all that good a weapon, unless you happen to be going
after undead.  The ludicrously small number of undead mobs in the
high end exp game means that for me this thing is going to be a
footnote at best, and since its probably going to be a rare drop
spell, more likely than not a "if I happen to see it drop I'll go
ahead and mem it" spell, like druids with their pet.  Personally
I'm far more interested in the projected reduction in the cost
of summoning the cleric pet.
