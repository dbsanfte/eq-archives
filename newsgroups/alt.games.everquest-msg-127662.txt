K. I know what you mean, just never heard it refered to as that :)

That was my guess also... shame though, would be a nice way to clear the
early stuff fast

The waves are time based right, and not when mob_xxx dies?  We were mezzing
early stuff to assist kill.. maybe we got behind because of that, hence
failed.

As I said, only our first try so were still learning the encounter (and ring
wars as a whole)

Statue - you mean idol?

Before we even tried AoW first, we killed the Idol unslowed (if you can't
kill idol unslowed, you have NO chance against the AoW)...   Idol goes down
pretty smoothly unslowed now.

We generally pull him, tank him unslowed to 10% or so then all camp out, rez
in/rebuff etc then pull him, slow him, and kill (slowed so we have more
mana/people ready for AoW)

AoW is a real pain now though.. he drops to 50% with 0 to very few
casualties, everybody still has good mana etc, then from 50% to 0% it all
goes haywire.

On our first ever run (also our best) we were on the 5th tank transition
with everything going perfectly, but the next tank just couldn't get agro
(he was duel wielding primal which im guessing sucks for taunt)..  if only
he had some snare glands or something back then heh (

Statue unslowed, tormy, vindi, tunare not pre-debuffed are all flawless
kills now (and some have been for several months) so im confident we have
the skills/people/classes/gear to slay him.. :(

I can't think of an attempt yet, where we haven't been trained by the Idol
or AoW.
heck, we've even had the AoW trained on us at the bank while we fought
Tormax (they should have root, stop noobs training them all over the damn
place)

The only thing we were really lacking was a well geared warrior (the rest of
the group was well geared, he was 'ok' geared)

The problem was the number of unmezzable, unstunnable, level 60, and insane
casting mobs.  200 PR, and one 60 mob i offtanked hit me for 350 with almost
every single a.e. Combine that with fast respawns and you have a tough camp
:)

We held it for several hours, I think it just became too much once people
started getting tired (you couldn't hardly sit, you couldn't afk etc)

You refering to the one near the wizard portal? (the one with the
untargettable mini cazic thule on top)

Last time I was doing maze, somebody there told me to pull the room (hah!)
so I gave him some shurikens, then watched him try to feign a whole room of
casters off (getting brutally killed in the process.. hehe)

We only had half a group, and a monk MA, so doing that room wasn't possible
anyway
