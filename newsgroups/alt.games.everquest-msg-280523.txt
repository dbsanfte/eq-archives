More RAM might not do much for me...perhaps it would speed up my zoning times...although
the disk lights are on solid when loading new zones.

Heh, well...ya caught me there.  The system-spec part of my reply was cut-and-paste from a
similar post on my guild forum.

>RAID 0 scares me. MTBF divided by 2 :)

Agreed, but there's nothing of consequence on those disks.  The only thing that I'd be
even remotely concerned about would be my EQL INIs and such, and I back up all of my EQ
customizations with KiXtart script every time I start EQ.

You caught me again - this time lacing my posts with keywords so that my wisdom will
populate Google Group's databases in perpetuity. Muahaha!! :>

The epoxy thing is actually a big deal if you're replacing the EXTREMELY noisy and
unreliable Northbridge (NB) heatsink/fan (HSF) on an Abit IC-7G motherboard with a passive
heatsink.

The original IC-7G HSF was held in place with double-sided thermal tape.  Those early HSFs
had a nasty habit of popping off the chip, and dropping down onto the backside of the AGP
card while the system was running.  POOF! - no more AGP card.  Abit began using a clip to
retain the HSF on later versions of the IC-7G.

Regardless of whether the OEM mounting method was tape or a metal retainer, the HSF was so
noisy that most users wanted to replace it straight away.  Fortunately, a large passive
heatsink, relying on the downdraft of the CPU cooler, provides sufficient cooling for the
NB chip.

Once you've made the decision to replace your IC-7G's HSF with a passive cooler, you can
plan your attack by visiting the Abit user forum.

But beware! - there are several threads there that might lead you down wacky paths of
trying to replicate the original heatsink retainer with a section of a bicycle
spoke...ack!  I tried it and almost ended up in tears.

Then I learned of the Arctic Silver epoxy...$13 bucks later I was all happy happy joy joy

Yessir, /agree wholeheartedly.  As an aside, my guild generally prohibits boxing on DKP
raids.  We'll occasionally box in an pocket healer, slower or mezzer, but only if there's
no other way to get the raid done.
