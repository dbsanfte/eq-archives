This is true, but actually getting these items will take a very
long time (you should see my wish list for my BL) and in the interim
drops in ST, NToV and Skyshrine and BoT (our usual targets - note,
we are not even close to elemental) will serve him VERY well.

Simply untrue - I know several Elemental/Time people who have jobs
and social lives and still raid.

Met my share of end-game assholes.  OTOH there are people like Richard
Lawson, and by extension his guild, who are approaching Time now and
are pretty cool people.

You've been in shitty guilds.  When you raid and 10 items drop for
40 people, obviously there has to be some mechanism for distributing
loot.  DKP has it's advantage, and flaws, as does Loot Council 
distribution.  We have very rigid requirements for what consitutes a
raid, so nobody is out racking up bogus RPP.  Further, just about
everyone in the main bulk of our raid force got something decent
this week.  We also keyed around 10 or 11 people for ST.  

Even though I can't actually fight in the dragon fights, I love raiding
with these guys.  They are appreciative as hell of the fact that I get
going 30 minutes early to get to Yelinak.  We took out 3 first brood in
2 hours yesterday (2.5 for me).  Another guildie got some SERIOUSLY sweet
gloves from the Yelinak head turn-in (now that I can get to him, looks
like we'll see a pair a week of those things, 2 so far).  BoT fights are 
another matter - pets allowed and I managed to get most of my mana dumped 
on them without aggro.  (Tues dumped my full mana bar on Thunderclap and
got summoned when he was at 1% - I saw the message for incoming heal
but Thunderclap died before it hit - I'd say I rode the aggro line 
perfectly that time :)

Alot of people have the same constraints.

Guilds also help for LDoN.  They provide a pool of people who's skills
I'm sure of.  I've done VASTLY better in terms of successful adventures
in a given time frame with guild groups than with PU groups.  So, being
in a guild simply means I'll get more AP per hour than I would in most
PU groups.

Not just the difference between success/failure - but the difference
between barely succeeding and succeeding in 50 minutes with 4 mini-kills.

I have a great time with my guild.  Part of it is the very strict voting
policy on new members (1 no vote from a full-time member and the recruit
doesn't get in.  Given that they have to spend 30 days grouping and 
raiding with us before that, we get a good idea of whether we want them
there or not.)

LDoN is a godsend for those of us in mid-level guilds.  We can complement
raid drops with LDoN purchases.  We have strong groups of people who are
used to working together to get points faster in LDoN.  Where LDoN shines
is filling in the gaps that raiding might not.  For example, I don't see
an IDIV item anywhere in my raiding future.  I can, however, save up for
a Ritual Claw of the Scion in Mistmoore at the same time I'm getting 
raid drops.
