Okay, I'll bite:  How do you get your pet to duck, then?

Mage pets cast:  earth/root; air/stun; fire/DD spells; and
water/DD spells.  AFAIK there's no way to tell the pet to quit casting
and just beat on stuff.  The best you can do is choose a pet that doesn't
cast a line you don't want  (like avoiding the Earth pet when fear kiting or
the Fire pet in Lavastorm etc.)
