Boy, I'm confused  (or just too polite to say you are.)  Quoting
the announcement:

"At that point the Cleric will need to head out and look for him.  A
killable version of Zordak will appear independent of the pearl
turn-in every few days (except after a server goes down, then he will
appear a little faster). Killing Zordak will transform him into dragon
form, and the Cleric (with help.) must kill him immediately."

That's about as clear as it gets:   "A killable version of Zordak will
appear independent of the pearl turn in every few days."  So just
where are you getting a triggered version?  They specifically say
there is NO triggered version.  Furthermore, they say they did not
want to reduce the bottleneck.  There's only going to be the one that
appears every "few days."

What they did was eliminate *their* problem:  a guild seeing a TPW
and killing the spawned dragon.  That resulted in one very pissed off
cleric and a lot of trouble between guilds.   Now the cleric "just" has
to wait a few days to kill him again.  *Their* problem -- a guild with a
TPW being pissed someone stole a mob they spawned -- has went
away.   The clerics problems have gotten worse, IMO.
