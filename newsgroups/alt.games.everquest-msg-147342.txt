Eh? Are we playing the same game Dan? Even someone as rigid as myself in my
playing habits (career soloist) likes to know how the "system works". It's
the equivelent of wanting to know RL "physics". How the "world" around you
really operates.

Some people like to know how the toaster works, others are just happy to get
toast. Not every curious person is a "leet powerlevelin' dood", some people
just like to know this sort of stuff.
