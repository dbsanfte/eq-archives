I'd agree, It probably is. They require that much bandwidth that it is,
likely, their biggest single cost. What Fooboy was trying to point out is
you do not pay for bandwidth usage in the same way you pay for electricity
or gas, it is not on a meter, you have pay for the link and it's yours. I
assume you are on cable or dsl, do you pay extra every month on the amount
of D/L'ing you do? No? Well neither do SOE...They just have a damn sight
larger monthly fee and installation cost. So cutting 200 users, per server,
does nothing, they cant then instantly throttle the bandwidth on one of
their links.

I could see them using something like this to cut long time idle players
thus freeing bandwidth up for those actually playing rather than AFK
trading. I say I could see, I just don't, as my experience of these
crashes/disconnects do no tie up with those accusing SOE of foul play.
