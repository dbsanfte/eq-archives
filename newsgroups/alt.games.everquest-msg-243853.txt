   No, the program EQMacros is not available any more.  It's changed form
is.  I am just not mentioning what it changed to, is all.  You can consider
a "less than absolutely complete" answer to be dishonest, of course.  About
the only concession I'll allow on this point is to add the word "legally"
the the sentence of the FAQ that says the program is no longer available.

   I hear it from time to time.  People still hear about about people using
macro's to do tradeskills and whatnot.  Again, if they really want to learn
how to use a third party macro program, they can do the research
themselves.

   I don't know what other legally shady software programs that are more
prevalent you are referring to.  Mention them, provide me links, and I will
decided if they they belong in the FAQ, hopefully with some input from
others in age.

   Remember, FAQ stands for "Frequently Asked Questions", not "An
exhaustive list of knowledge that addresses every aspect of the subject at
hand".
