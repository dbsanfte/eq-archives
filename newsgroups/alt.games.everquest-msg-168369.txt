Ah, how fondly I remember days when Sleepers Tomb repopped.  This
meant that the core of my guild would go off to somewhere I
couldnt access, and I'd be free to exp or fool around doing
whatever I liked, without having to hear how whatever they were
doing could really use another cleric.

The guild I'm in awards ST keys, not on merit or on need, but
strictly on a "raid time served" basis.  Well, the first six keys
went via dictate to high attendance people in key classes... but
after that the officers moved to this method which they feel
shows less bias.

Personally, I'd argue for bias; we have some recent beastlord
recruits who raid with us a great deal and are a very useful
class, one is now 65 (he joined at 52 while I was 59, and hit 65
a week before I did), plays a lot, raids constantly, and has
expressed a strong interest in a ST key.  I think at least one of
each class should get a key before giving their fifth cleric (of
29 keys, now 5 are in the hands of clerics!) one.

At any rate, I looted the shard (or whatever it was, looked like
an aviak talon, no stats) and went on with the raid.  When it was
over, I got a guild rogue and wizard to help me get the key
itself.  The rogue said he needed a plus 3% lockpick item, which
I happened to have on my bard.  He also said I'd need a shaman.
Well my shaman buddy had a headache and was about to log... but
he was able to quickly brew up a potion to take care of my
problem.

The wizard ported the rogue and I to CS, and we took off
running.  I ran SG while they succored, and beat them both across
into WW as usual.  We went on over to DN, zoned in, and invised
up.  The rogue led us over to a doorway which he unlocked, and we
went in.  My invis dropped once inside as invis so often does,
and a spider aggroed me, so we had to kill it.

Then I tried to get up to the dragon to hand in.  No dice, I ran
at the steps from all different angles, jumping for all I was
worth, just couldn't get up there.  Stuck, a victim of poorly
planned ergonomics!  Luckily my rogue guide was a gnome who'd had
similar trouble... so he'd warned me in advance the shaman would
be needed.  I uncorked a Titan potion, drank it down in one
LOOOOOOOOONG gulp (30 seconds!) and then it was a simple matter
to clamber up the steps to the mob.  Handed him the claw thing,
got my key, climbed back down to the waiting wizard.  He ported
us out, done.

Later, I went to the sleeping dragon statue in EW and clicked on
it to zone in.  Scary room full of crystal gargoyles... or
statues of them, couldn't target, at any rate no aggro.  Key on
keyring, off to bed.

I hear ST repops today, so I guess I'll finally see what I'm
really in for, instead of second hand stories.
