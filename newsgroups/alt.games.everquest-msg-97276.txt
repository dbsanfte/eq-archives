100% horseshit. I've matched every argument put forward. If you have
one I missed, feel free to put it here and I'll update you. Otherwise
you can only claim that by putting your hands over your eyes and
shouting "I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!"

By the way the above response was aimed at someone who thought being
happy the spellbook was gone is something simpleminded. Are you
defending that position as well?

Perhaps you should try to understand the arguments instead of assuming
they are invalid because they don't agree with yours.

Dumbing it down? Reducing the amount of exp in the newbie levels is
dumbing it down? Getting rid of the dumbest design decision in history
in the spellbook medding is dumbing it down?

Yes, there's rhetoric going on here, but its not coming from me. It's
coming from people who are afraid of changes, and apparently lack the
ability to think them through.

Their status as rites of passage does not grant them immunity from
being *stupid*.

It boggles the mind that anyone could think sitting and staring at a
spellbook is a *good* thing. Where does that sort of logic come from?

In my experience those who need to believe in slippery slopes either
believe no one is capable of thinking for themselves on a case by case
basis, or are themselves incapable of that.

It's a catchphrase. To prove that something is a slippery slope you
have to prove that what is being done *will* lead to bad things down
the road.

That has not been even remotely proven. Just some mewlings about too
fast leveling (from 1-10? /laugh) and bitterness that future people
won't have to deal with hell levels like they did.

I find it beyond ironic that I am being labelled a VAK when I am
cheering the elimination of very things I've derided Verant for for
years. These things - hybrid penalties, spellbook medding - were
idiotic decisions and I said it many times. 

The definition of a VAK is someone who defends their obviously wrong
decisions. The spellbook and hell levels both qualify.

And, since its being skimped over, still waiting for an explanation on
how the slippery slope has led us all to doom when the original 35+
spellbook was removed, still waiting for an explanation on how the
slippery slope has led us all to doom when the death penalty was cut
in half. Still waiting on..

What? There was no doom? Everything went fine?

Not much of a slippery slope....
