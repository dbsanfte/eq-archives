Methinks you don't know what a strawman is.  'You are using a strawman 
argument' translates roughly as 'You are saying that your opponent is 
saying something that he is clearly not'.

I will defend my own views.  But I will not defend the views that you 
have somehow decided I have, because it's pointless.
