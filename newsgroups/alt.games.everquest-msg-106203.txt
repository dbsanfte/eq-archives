The thing is, we don't disagree with your conclusion, we're just saying the
manner in which you conducted the tests is inconclusive, as it doesn't test
a single variable.  Whether or not level really has an effect isn't the
issue.  The issue is that you chose to assume that it doesn't, when you have
no proof of that.  That brings your results into question.  In order to
imply a correlation, you must only change one variable.

I honestly don't know how that will play out, but it needs to be done to
validate your findings.
