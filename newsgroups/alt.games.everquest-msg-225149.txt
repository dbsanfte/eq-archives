Well, there are worse things to ask.  Like, in the old "Dear Mynx" quake
advice column, someone wrote in once and said that a bunch of the guys
were talking, and it somehow came out that everyone wiped their ass
starting at the top and going down toward the legs, whereas the writer
did his the other way, starting down and working up, and everyone was making
fun of him now.  He wanted to know if he was a freak.

Of course the real question is why the hell that ever became a topic of
conversation in the first place, but nevertheless, Mynx asked around at the
office, and found out that everyone did it top to bottom, so the guy was
indeed a freak.

(Personally, I'm with that freak.  In an attempt at comformity, I gave the
majority way a try, and it was evil, freaky, and wrong--about is bad as
visualizing the days right to left :-)).
