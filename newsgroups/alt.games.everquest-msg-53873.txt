That would make sense then - I was absolutely amazed that I had survived
to the zone line in the first place. (Good segue...)

For those of you that have an Enchanter as your main, don't ever try to
level up an alt, and then trust that the enchanter in your group knows
what you know or plays like you play. I was designated alterant healer.
Cleric was oom. Tank down to 40 health. I start chain-casting light
healing just to try and keep up with the damage he was taking. This of
course agro's two orcs onto me and I was already at 50 health. I "healer
agro'd, waiting for mez" so what does our enchanter do?

Nukes the mob on the tank.
