    MC2 is the same mana regen as Breeze. MC3 is one mana per tick better
than that. When in a good group, I found blues in 56 went by at one per hour
and a quarter, or four per five hours. So you're giving up either a level
(the 30 hour, incremental viewpoint) or nearly three levels (the total cost
viewpoint) for that mana regen. Looking at the spell list for druids, that's
a lot of good stuff to give up. It's especially bad when you consider how
much mana regen you'll get when you get to 60.
