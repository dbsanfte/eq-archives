You and Terry have a similar problem.  People who charm kite generally
have better connections I think.  I started a bard at release and got
to 29.  I stopped when I switched from a dialup ISP where I had very
consistent pings of 180 with no spikes to one with minimum pings of 350
and many spikes.  I suddenly went from twisting 3 songs with ease to
only keeping 2 up, and had several lag deaths.
