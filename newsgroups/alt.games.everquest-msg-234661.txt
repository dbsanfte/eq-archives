I have a 56 iksar monk (of noble nature, bit like the sharks in "finding
nemo") and whilst i used to group a lot in my earlier levels, i haven't done
so for years and am not sure how to play properly regarding aggro; i usually
dual box with my druid, so generating huge aggro is a good thing, but i'd
really like to group with others and see new zones. I'm a casual player at
best. How can i best supplement the main tank with my DPS without becoming a
smudgy heap of scales? One monk i knew used to fd every now and then to
decrease aggro but that seemed ineffient.

p.s. I have been reading the n.g. for years and years; it's always full of
btching but often has little articles that are purest gold, and i find
myself reading it more than playing now.

p.p.s i miss mobhunter's regular articles and when eq atlas was kept up to
date. I feel sometimes the torch isn't passed. on. Interesting idea for
science fiction novel; the character you create becomes your IP, and so
becomes transferrable. Completely untenable with current tech, but i can
imagine it could be done.. i mean, look at the guy who created drizzt
do'urden (sp?) Surely he should be allowed to take that character into any
game he chooses? Wishfull thinking i know.

p.p.p.s. I miss planescape's characters. Best story come roleplaying game
ever. Althought the dark elf in baldur's gate 2 come's close. I'll never
understand why there was no option in that game of being a god and taking
her as a wife too. 8-]
