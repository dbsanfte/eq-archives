I don't know why americans are whining, shit the rest of the world has
had high gas prices for quite some time.  Over the last year, gas prices
rose $0.25-0.30 per litre, and there are 4 litres to a gallon.  So if we
do some math.  I think today gas is 72.5 (CDN)  x4 = $2.9(CDN) which is
around $1.90 american.  And I live in the city, most people in canada
don't which means their gas is even more expensive, So america's gas
hasn't gone up that much, it has just equalled itself with the rest of
the world.
