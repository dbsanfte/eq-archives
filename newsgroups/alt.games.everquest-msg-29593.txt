There is a very easy counterargument for that. Verant themselves provide
forums and venues for discussing the game, so this way of exchanging
information is *encouraged*. It's called community-building, and it's an
important factor in the success of any online game, and Verant know it.

So, no, anybody who doesn't read this newsgroup or any web resources
aren't doing the right thing, more like they are doing themselves a
disservice (unless, of course, they are Deep Roleplayers and any kind of
spoilage affects *their* enjoyment).
