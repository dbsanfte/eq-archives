DT, I can't tell whether you are appreciating it or blowing it off as trivial. I for one
welcome a chance at armor you can actually attain without being of a level to be hunting
in CC or the worst parts of Vellious that will give me a fair boost in AC and 30 agi.
Not to mention, some good midrange stuff for our tailors to work their skill up higher
towards 200 without spending a bloody fortune. (If you're willing to hunt the silk and
make the viscous mana yourself, that is, of course.)
