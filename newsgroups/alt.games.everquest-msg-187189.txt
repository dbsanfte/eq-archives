hehe, I can say the same thing about Asus boards. The important thing
to remember is to follow the manufacturer's reccomendations for parts.
I have a asus board thats VERY picky with ram. Another board
autodetects all of its voltage settings incorrectly. The key is to get
quality parts to go on the board. Dont skimp. And do tons of research.
It can get bewildering with all the different configurations... "part
A" wont work with "Board B" but works great in "Board C" and so on.

A good rock solid power supply is key too (dont just go by power
ratings, not all 300W+ power supplies are equal). I was at Fry's
electronics the other day, and was shocked to see they sell cases with
wimpy 150W power supplies. Nothing current will run reliably with such
a PS.
