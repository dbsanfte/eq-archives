I'm assuming you have windows XP, but IIRC any windows will show it in the
display properties.

right click anywhere on the desktop and go to properties.  click on settings
tab (again, might be called different in older versions of windows).

Look for ...Monitor on (insert video card name here).

alternatively right click on my computer, go to Properties, hardware, device
manager and click on the Display Driver option.
