I was in Stormhold and was looking for the underforge.  I was the tank
(22 Barb. Guardian) I came across a zombie that conned level 20 double
up arrow.  It agroed me and started hiting me for 300 plus.  I had over
1000 hps buffed and ac was at 1512.  The healer could not keep me
alive, and quickly died next.  I was wondering if this was pretty
common for level 20 plus mobs, I mean three hits and almost dead.  Is
it going to take a healer rotation?  Healer was level 18.  Other time
was in TS and a mob there was hiting for 200 plus (Undead in gorge near
town).  Do I need to get AC way up or just level up more on low mobs.
For that matter, theres a named crab near the top north east coast
(name escapes me for now) and that thing is a killer.

I have saved 5 gold up, but vendor armor is way expensive. Any
suggestions on how to kill that guy and get my shard, heh.  Oh yeah,
and the healers shard.
