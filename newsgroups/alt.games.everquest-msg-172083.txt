My ranger is 17 and on track, almost everything in NK is green except
for the borer beetles and the griffs. (And of course the hill giants.)
The griffs are a PITA, and the bugs drop nothing of interest and hit
fairly hard.

I've been finding that the lion patriarchs and even an occasional
matriarch in EK are still blue and easy fights for xp at that level.
