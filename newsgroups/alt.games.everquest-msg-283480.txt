What classes do you think people will pick?

What races?

Hmm, seems to me there won't be any cats, unless they turn Kerra into a 
start city and that seems very unlikely.

Where will they flock?

Having been thru a couple "fresh start" servers, I bet there will be a 
LOT of crowding in the most popular beginner areas, and half the spots 
you could level will be nearly empty.

Are they including the tutorial?  Thats instanced, so the crowding has 
its limits.

How about LDoN's... yes, its a few levels before you can start those, 
but once you do the whole overcrowded problem vanishes.  Are they 
including them?

If the LDoN/Magus system isn't in place, then travel becomes a lot more 
difficult than people are used to; are Druids and Wizards going to be 
faced with the whole Taxi Class thing again?  How far into progression 
is it before POP opens up and they can take a breather?  (or looked at 
another way, suddenly find their customer base has vanished)

Itemization is very important to some classes, and not so much to 
others.  Or maybe thats not true anymore.  At any rate, I'm thinking 
Mages might actually be in demand due to summoned focus jewelry and 
summoned armor, for a while.  Weapons, not so much, even given the "old 
world" limitation, I just don't think mage weapons will ever be in demand.
