I am finally adjusting from the "old style" screen to using the
see-through window mode.  I have the polygons set so it adds tint to
the windows, but would like to darken them just a bit more to see if
it makes it easier to get text colors I can see well no matter what
the local scenery.  I noticed there is a command for this in the
eqdirectory (forgot to write it down of coarse).  I am not sure if
the code to use after the command is like the chat font size a 1-5
or like user color which is 3 numbers.  Can any one give me a bit of
insight please.  Thank you for your time.
