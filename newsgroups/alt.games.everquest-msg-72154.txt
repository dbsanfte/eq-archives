You say you don't want to play a warrior, so in case you forgot these items:

Langseax
Crafted Bracers

Are Warrior only. Everything else can be used by the war classes IIRC. (WAR,
PAL, RNG, SHD, BRD, ROG)
Also look at the sizes on your pieces, some of your armor pieces will only
fit med creatures.

I don't know much about those classes (went straight from Warrior to
casters), so I won't speculate on which one to pick. My reccomendation would
be try one out, and if you don't like it delete it. If you do like it, level
it to 6 before giving up the goodies. You don't want to get caught by that
30 min newbie corpse poof.
