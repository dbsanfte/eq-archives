/em raises his hand. Viva la trn.

Many of the HTML posts are actually multipart/alternative, where
the message itself is contained twice in the post, once as plain
text and once with HTML tags. Such messages are over twice as
large as an equivalent plain text post. Hence each takes twice
as long to download, twice as much storage space on EVERY news
server around the globe which it reaches, and twice the bandwidth
to propagate across all of those news servers.

In short, it's a damn big waste of resources for both the
news server operators and the readers who download them,
considering that the value added approaches nil.
