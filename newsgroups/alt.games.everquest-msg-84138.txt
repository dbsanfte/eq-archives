Problem is that it just causes some idiots to question why? I said so,
that's enough reason for you.

Reason actually is that on few occasions when I have shown people things I
have not been paying attn and instinctively hit trade as if I was swapping
items between characters, I have always managed to hit cancel before I lost
the item but one day I won't be so fast. This never happens when selling,
only when showing someone, when I have a possible sale my mind is on what I
am doing, it's when I'm not selling the item my mind seems to wander.

I leave the inspect message on so I have an idea of what the guy in front of
me is doing...I had one guy running back and forth, in my face, out of it,
in my face, out of it...no inspect, no tell or say...I checked ignore, he
wasn't listed, so I use the /boggle emote...he then tells me "sorry trying
to get a decent screenie, those swords are awesome, what are they"...LOL,
hadn't occured to me that that is what I must look like when I'm trying to
do the same (and it's a shame the weapons in question are so mediocre)

As for inspects, when I first started playing I was told it was considered
bad form to inspect with out asking (I remember asking a cleric if I could
once and was told that he didn't permit inspects, not sure how enforced that
one but I respected his wished and he told me what the armour was he was
wearing) this way of thinking stuck and because of that I thought it rude
when someone did it to me, now I don't care (thanks to many arguements in
this group about it) but would still rather know, if only to prepare me for
the begging question that normally follows. I still have the ability to
inspect via right click, turned off, knowing how I used to feel about it and
how others still do, 90% of inspects are probably just attempts to /con.
