The best way to transfer items without two accounts or help from someone
else is to bring both characters to an unused tradeskill container (forge,
oven, etc.), put the items in you want to transfer, camp, log in the other
character, and take them out.  Items will never decay in a tradeskill
container and if someone happens to go wandering by they won't see a bag
lying on the ground just asking to be picked up.
