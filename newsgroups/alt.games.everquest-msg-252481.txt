Well, no. Everything you mention is only a short term surprise. Sure
you can go to a dangerous trek to the frozen barbarian homeland, once
or twice. After that it becomes old hat.

This is the problem with MMORPGS, you are playing in six months and
things are not new anymore. Then they add an expansion, but it doesn't
solve the problems of Gfay and East commons being too familiar and
unused. It doesn't solve the problem of West Karana always sucking, so
no one really used it for more than passing through. 

After five years west karana, Gfay and east commons still ALL SUCK.
Gfay and east commons got small updates for newbie quests, but for
some odd reason they did not get a more major overhaul like Nek woods
which actually got added camps of orcs that were never there, and
such. East commons still having only a couple orc camps after 5 years
is just weird.

So I really don't agree, since the same thing will happen in EQ2. An
area will be fresh and new at first then get old hat. This will keep
happening until people start making more advanced mmorpgs which
constantly change, automatically with some form of chaos tools and no
human intervention.

The static "zone" based model just leaves a lot to be desired because
they forget old zones. Since the same people will be doing EQ2, I
honestly don't think that will change. 

I remember a long time ago where people were complaining about a dark
elf camp suddenly being dropped into lesser fay. Abashi, or someone,
defended it by saying EQ was a dynamic and ever changing game so
people should expect that. The thing is, he was greatly exaggerating.
The truth is that its a barely dynamic pretty much NEVER changing
game, except for new add ons (which are essentially new static
content.) 

An example is that dark elf camp in lesser fay, many players would
probably not even view that as a change since for the better part of
five years its been there. A change like that is not dynamic, since it
is a perm change. Later they've done stuff with "zone change events",
but even those have been static zone changes which change for weeks or
months and then revert back. Then they do the same change again next
time, with the same loot.  

Its all just too dang static. The things you are talking about were
the way you felt when the game was new and the areas fresh. It was
almost like the game was whispering in your ear that it would always
be that way, that you'd always be discovering new things. We found
out, all too soon, that even a fairly casual player will exhaust
content before the next addition.

You logged in and wondered about this great power struggle in freeport
between the paladins and the militia. After six months, you were no
longer wondering since nother ever changed. After five years, nothing
still has changed. When I first started playing, I never dreamed that
such things would just stay exactly the same like that for five years.
I fully expected to log in next week and find that the paladins had
gained control or something and then the week after that it went the
other way, perhaps with quests that players did having a hand in this.

So for me, part of the attraction was that the game SEEMED like it
COULD be dynamic. I never dreamed that it wasn't in the least. 

The problem with a fresh start, in a static world, is that it "isn't"
for very long. My guess is EQ2 will be just the same, buy the game and
Whee!!! Six months later and I'll be going, "yawn, same old thing."
