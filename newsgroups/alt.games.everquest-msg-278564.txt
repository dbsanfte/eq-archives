Group xp debt CAN be good, if it keep the group concentrating on
making sure everyone survives.  But it can also make people far
more wary of grouping.  If that stranger you picked up for your
group turns out to be an idiot who gets himself killed, you get
stuck with some of the debt for his idiocy.  Far safer to group
with people you already know, or just to solo.

This is compounded if the game also makes it easier to form groups.
I remember reading early reports about EQ2, where you can invite
people from anywhere in the zone (and the zones are big), maybe
even anywhere in the game?  Someone had a tradeskiller with stuff
up for sale, and would get tells from potential buyers.  To make
it easy for them to find him, he'd invite them into a group so they
could use EQ2's features for helping group members locate each
other.  But then, the buyer would sometimes die en route, and he'd
get stuck with some of their debt.  Usually followed by the buyer
disbanding the group and never showing up to make the purchase.
