Let me be a gentleman and not flame.

I think your idea is completely unworkable.  I think this automated program
that keeps logs of bazaar prices per item, character tell/ooc/chat channel
histories, proximities, guild affiilations and then automatically analyzes
that info to determine if the transfer of funds was "valid" is beyond the
capabilities of SOE.  If the logs have to be reviewed by a human being, I
doubt SOE has anywhere near the manpower for the task.

I think your idea is scary.  I, along with most others, are not willing to
relinquish the efforts of our characters to the computations of some
super-snooper kludge bolted on top of Everquest.

I think your idea will have unintended consequences.  The bazaar is slow
enough now.  Will anybody even be able to do move once we add the overhead
of "Super-Snooper" to the mix.

I think your idea does not solve the problem you stated.  People are far
more effectively and consistently soloed to a high level by  being
PowerLeveled by another character than gearing up from 100K of plat.
Besides that, almost every class in the game can be soloed up to 40 and
therefore not no what to do in a group setting.  What are you going to do
about them?

I wish people couldn't go out an buy more plat than any of my characters
have probably ever seen throughout their EQ careers.  I also wish people
didn't illegally park handicapped spots, but sometimes life isn't fair and
you move on.
