    I agree with everything you've said.  If this happened in my guild, I would
be very quick with the "he goes or I do" talk.  Or maybe, on reflection, I might
take the "This griefer is still in our guild and you wipes have had PLENTY of
time to pound out /disband Jerkwad???" track and just express outrage and
disband myself.

   Ok, I don't agree with this.  This guy is proud that he ripped someone off,
and he thinks the money is rightfully his.  There is no way he would turn over a
cent of it to make anyone think any better of him.
