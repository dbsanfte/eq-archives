Hehe, i dont get why people dont learn to use /loc. I have met a lot of
people who do not know how to use the /loc command, i mean, it take around
5 min to learn to navigate with it.
And if theyre combined with not having Sense heading maxed (know a certain
level 51 who cannot follow a loc, and do only have sense heading at 10,
took him 20 min to find me in Feerott so he could get a port) i dont see
how they ever managed to get to that high level.
