As John Lynch said, XP Home and XP Pro are completely identical except 
for a few default UI settings and some extra utilities included for 
twiddling security, networks, etc.  There's nothing about Pro that'd get

Me too.  My games even run faster on it, which is contrary to most 
results; I guess the XP drivers for my hardware are just better.
