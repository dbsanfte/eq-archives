Check out mobhunter.com which has excerpts from a chat session on eqstratics
with EQ staff.

I quote:
"Familiars will follow the Wizards around. They do not attack, and can
recieve no commands other then /pet get lost. They will zone with the
Wizards, and be there waiting for them when they log in (they do not stay in
the world when the wizard is gone though)..."

Further is says they will provide MANA REGEN to the wizard.

Hello! Hello! Throw the mages a mana regen bone already would you Verant?
