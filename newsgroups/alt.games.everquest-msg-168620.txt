But if the zone rolls back, logging back in will load what the zone thinks
is your last saved version (ie rolled back) no?
I thought not, but some guildies strongly believe otherwise.

Well, its not something that happens on every /camp.. there are some
specific conditions to it.  If it were that easily reproducable it would be
in widespread use, and easily found/fixed in a very fast time :)

I know that, what im questioning is the /report command, to log "--You have
looted"
My basic understanding of report (and what it says) is
/report xxxx means it will make a log of the last 10 lines, that came from
the name xxxx

So if you type /report delores.. why would it log "you have looted", when
the word delores isn't mentioned in that line?

I was told once, /report me is the one to use, but I dunno.. im not 100%
either way
