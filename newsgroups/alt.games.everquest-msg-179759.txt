There are no mobs in the lost valley, but there are giants and lots of other
nasties that see invis on the other side of the tunnel.  It is a bad idea to
try to make it through DL unless you know the way.

The best way to get to OT, is to either use the POK book, if you can (It's
in a safe place, kinda, invis before zone in), OR if you don't have planes
of power, take the boat.  Remember boats??  The boat for OT leaves from the
Oasis of Marr, drops you on the beach of Ogre Island, make sure you invis
up, run around the big rock to your right and run to the end of the first
long dock.  Wait there for a very ugly boat to pick you up.  Then, as soon
as you zone into OT, jump ship!  This is important as there are meanies who
like to eat little druids near the dock.

And...most importantly of all...GET MAPS!  http://www.eqatlas.com has tons
of them, make sure you get a map for every zone you travel to, and have a
/loc hotbutton, and know how to read locs.  It will save your life!!!

Good luck,
Dea
