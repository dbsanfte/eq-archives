Dumb question #1:  I hear about groups "rolling" on a certain item off
a mob, for example, "We rolled, the rogue won".  What is involved in
"rolling" for an item?

Dumb question #2:  When two players are in a duel, can they get
buffs/heals from other players while they're dueling? I would think
that they wouldn't be allowed to, since one person could, for example,
have a cleric friend stand by and heal them while they're dueling and
that would be really unfair.
