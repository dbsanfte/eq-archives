They were in those same links and cites that those people provided. Oh 
wait, you didn't see those, did you. They are up that-a-way, up thread 
somewhere.

You know what, in the end, it doesn't matter.

Even *if* pussy for coward doesn't derive from pussy for vagina (and note 
that I am not saying in this post whether it does or not), the fact of the 
matter is that pussy is a word that is considered obsene and vulgar[1]. No 
matter the context. Arguing that he didn't mean this definition, he meant 
this definition doesn't matter. In the end, it is obscene.

[1] Leaving aside the probability that there are people that don't find it 
obscene, Blizzard found it obscene enough to filter it out. Their 
playground, their rules.
