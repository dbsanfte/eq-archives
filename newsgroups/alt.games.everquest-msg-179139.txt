I feel your pain.  I created the cleric, (now 29),  *just* so I'd have to get
in some "real" groups, hoping I'd find some people I would click with, join
their guild and live happily everguilded after.   
But I find I spend 95% of my time playing my 52 ranger with a couple close
friends... and am pretty darn happy that way.  The only downside is that we
will never get the "uber raid gear" or get "flagged" for the new POP zones,
(haven't even been in them yet except for tranquility....)
