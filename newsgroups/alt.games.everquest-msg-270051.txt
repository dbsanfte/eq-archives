You might check the tradeskill guides at Trader's Workshop:

www.geocities.com/shadowknight57/

Xanthe Ravenwolf has tradeskill guides for all tradeskills IIRC are
what she thought was the cheapest way to get to GM level or as near as
she could. They are somewhat out of date and she is looking at updating
them.

I took a look and her guide for pottery maxes out at the moment around
220 (???). 

Hope this helps.
