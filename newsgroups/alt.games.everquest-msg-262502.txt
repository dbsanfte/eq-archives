This week we take a look at some of the news appearing throughout the
Everquest community.

On Halloween SOE hosts the New Orleans Fan Faire. SOE posted the
schedule for this year's Fan Faire last week. Your favorite cleric
(that's me in case you forgot) will be in attendance armed with an all
new agenda to stuff into the pockets of anyone with an SOE badge. Like
the summit agenda, I will post this agenda here a week or two before
the Fan Faire.

This week SOE announced SOE Worlds a print magazine devoted to
Everquest, Everquest 2, Everquest Online Adventures, Star Wars
Galaxies, and the rest of SOE's army of massive online games. The
magazine includes strategy articles, general reviews, fiction, and
interviews. I expected something like this to come out eventually; I'm
surprised it took as long as it did.

The largest buzz and attention in the last couple of weeks appears to
focus on Epic 1.5s. Every class board, hundreds of discussions on the
EQ Live forums, and most of the developer and community feedback
follows the progression of these quests. Epic raids pour into most chat
channels and even the non-raiders seem to have epic fever. Why people
seem to be more interested in epics than levels, AAs, spells, or other
gear seems beyond me. It may be the most popular Omens feature for
high-level players.

A bit of nastiness hit quite a few people last week. People's Omens
accounts shut off without warning and sent level 66+ players back to
their level 65 self. At first rumors spoke of credit transaction
problems but reports came in from people who bought their copy in the
store. Sony jumped on it and posted this statement. I heard of nearly
half a dozen people losing their level in this manner but all of them
seemed to get it back without too much of a hassle. This seems to be
the only major bug in an otherwise smooth expansion release; certainly
smoother than Gates of Discord which suffered from random linkdeaths
for nearly a week.

A new feature on test has bards cheering. Bards will soon have the
ability to auto-twist songs using a new "/melody" command. Typing
"/melody 1 2 3" will play each of the three songs in sequence. The
change helps bards become more social creatures, giving them the time
to chat with friends and watch Tivo until their friends shout "Heal Me,
Dolt!". Some bard purists complain that it removes one of the great
tests of skills for bards but most bards agree that the loss of
challenge is worth the reduction in repetitive motion stress.

66+ spell costs dropped from 140,000 plat on the first few days to
60,000 plat today on Quellious. I expect to see them drop to 10k before
they meet the balance of supply and demand. This should probably happen
in a month or two. I still know little about the location of 69 and 70
spells. The no-drop requirement worries me. Instead of living the
twilight of my levels where I choose, I will probably have to hunt in
Muramite Provingrounds and Riftseeker's in order to receive 69 and 70
spells.

People continue to migrate in long lines to the Wall of Slaughter.
Though better experience and loot awaits discovery in Ruined City of
Dranik and its two sets of instances, people prefer the easier hunting
ground and higher drop-rate of the Wall. I cannot blame them and it is
better to have one zone like the Wall than none at all, but it will be
nice to see people spread out a bit more into the other lands. In the
mean time, for great fun and high adventure, travel to the Ruined City
of Dranik through the Bloodfields. If you are truly a band of hearty
adventurers, attempt the Sewers and Catacombs expeditions.

One thing that definitely appears to be missing are random rare drops
on normal mobs. Instead of spending hours camping the same two spawn
areas in the Hollows, I'd prefer to have a low chance (1/100) of
receiving a rune drop or a loot item off of a normal beast. Perhaps
they haven't been found and reported yet, but so far I have seen none.

Expect a new system for the loading screens between zones. People in
beta had problems with the original one looking too much like a system
hanging forever so they put in the loading screen. The loading screen,
however, breaks the flow of the game too much. Sony builds a new system
as we speak. Perhaps we will see it in the mid-October patch.

I look with narrowed eyes to find problems for the single-group hunter
in Omens and I find few. Spell drops seem reasonable. I received a
piece of loot in a single-group battle I could immediately use,
something that hasn't happened to me in a long while. High level
players can reach high level loot without required raiding. We have so
many useful zones that some excellent hunting areas like the Ruined
City of Draniks sit empty. Most of the problems I find and report are
little more than nitpicks. Overall I still give Omens a big thumbs-up.
