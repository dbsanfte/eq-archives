    All you have to do is change the word "likely" to possibly here and I'm
pretty much in complete agreement with your post.

      I think outcome 4) really depends on what sort of player you are. 
There is little debate that EQ is a game with much more content than CoH. 
However alot of the content of EQ seems to be to be tied to pretty big time
sinks.  Trade skills, for example.  I know they've fairly recently made
changes to the interface of how they work, but still, you don't find many
people who actually enjoy the process of using them rather than just
wanting the end result or skill ups.  

    If you want to have the rewards of being a higher player without being
"gimped", you're going to have to do some camping at some point.  Some to
get nifty spells, some to get nifty equipment drops, some to cash to get
decent gear for your level or to buy the gems you need to burn to cast your
most popular spells.  I think that most long term players face camping for
all three reasons.  This lead to my ultimate boredom and withdrawal from
play.  I simply grew to hate it.  I much more wanted to just get into the
action, every time I logged in, and start pounding stuff.  CoH provides
this in spades.

   And alot of other people, as well.  CoH is pretty, but it certainly is
much more shallow than EQ, and presumably other MMORPGs that are
available.  But there are plenty of people who do stick past the first free
month, too.

   And that is another issue.  You found EQ.  I firmly believe, that all
things taken together, EQ as it stands now is a better game than CoH as it
stands now.  However, I think that EQ is a game that sliding into decline,
and CoH is a game that is growing in stature in terms of content and
accessibility to new players.  For many of us that have played EQ for
years, we are simply burnt out on it and were ready to move on to something
new.  CoH is certainly that, and it is a well done new.  Plus, it lacks
many of the features that so many of us felt burnt out on in EQ.

    True enough, I suppose.  But then, what are you fighting for in any
MMORPG?  Loot?  Cash?  Sooner or later trying to get these things starts to
feel like having a second job.  For me, if the act of fighting is fun, then
the ultimate purpose for it doesn't matter.

    I came to point where fighting to get gear and whatever else I needed
to play my character effectively was just painfully tedious.  I think that
all MMORPGs have an element of being treadmills in them.  You kill stuff,
to get experience, so you can level, so you can kill bigger things, so you
can get experience...  There can be other stuff thrown in as well, of
course, but this is the basic nature of the beast.  

   The devs of CoH have said that they are going to be adding more content
to increase the depth of their game.  And I think they will.  But I can't
ever see it being as complex a game as EQ.  But complex doesn't always
translate into "More fun for everyone".  If you want to simply jump in and
get into a good rip roaring fight with something, rather than deal with a
bunch of built in time sinks, then CoH might very well appeal to you much
more than EQ, especially if you are burnt out on EQ.

    Just my take.

    Course, there is always EQII, which I am sure will be out sooner or
later, which I am very curious about too.  But if they have in alot of
built in time sinks that EQ Live has, then I seriously doubt that I will be
getting into that one much either.  But I am keeping an open mind on it.
