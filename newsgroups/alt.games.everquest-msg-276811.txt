It's dark out here and this candle is worthless!

Ooooh, cool boats!

You say out of character, "Poor Paladin paying 2gp for a bind!"

Fighting naked on Orc Hill.

Making my own patchwork armor.  Just say no to naked melee!

Attempting a night attack on 'Orc 1' in East Commonlands and
having 4 out of 6 in group killed.

You tell your group, "Wow, Griffons hit hard!"

"You have slain Squire Narl!"

Drowning in the moat around Castle Crushbone.

Figuring out how swimming worked and NOT drowning in the moat.  :)

Celebrating with my friend when his Ranger finally got far enough
into level 9 that he no longer feared losing it for a fourth time
(also in Castle Crushbone).

Zoning so quickly that I had to wait a minute for trains to clear
before returning to Castle Crushbone.  (That was with a 200MHz
Pentium MMX with 64MB RAM and a Voodoo Banshee video card).

somebody shouts, "D'Vinn to zone!"

somebody shouts, "Can some high level please kill D'Vinn?"

The invasion of the Gnome Necros.  (Some yutz posted a guide on
the net that claimed Necros were the most powerfull class in EQ
and Gnomes made the best Necros, hundreds, perhaps thousands of
l33t sheep immediately jumped on the bandwagon.)

Making my own banded armor.

somebody auctions, "WTT Yak and M2H for Wizard gear, trade ONLY,
no plat"

Making a decent profit selling banded to the masses.

Soloing in Unrest because no pickup group would take any hybrid.

Making a CR from Arena to Unrest twice in one day, cursing
all casters every step of the way.

Riding the Maiden's Voyage to Kunark when it was new.

...

I've been playing well over 5 years now, still haven't hit a
level cap, and I like it that way.
