XP is not more secure than 98SE if you are talking about remote 
exploits. XP provides security for multiple users on the same machine, 
whereas 98SE lets anyone using the machine do anything they like to it. 
So, in the context of playing EQ by a single user it is wrong to say XP 
is more secure. If all you're doing is playing EQ on it you don't need 
the extra overhead of NTFS.

I'd be more worried running XP without a firewall than 98SE.
