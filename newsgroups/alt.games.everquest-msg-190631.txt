    Probably no use to you at all but I just spent about an hour and a half
powerlevelling some ppl in high keep. Actually I was powerlevelling one guy
and in the normal way of high keep more people kept showing up and pretty
soon I was powerlevelling almost a full group.

    I have a 52 SK and my method went like this:

    Pull/debuff mob, smack it down to almost dead

    Feign death - repeat until succes (feign death as a spell bloats goats)

    Lowbies splat mob while im feigning - and get 100% exp. I don't even get
a faction hit.


    Was loads of fun for all concerned, and the shammy I was PLing made more
than 2 levels (28 to 30 and-a-bit)

Cheers,
James
