Magician skills:
-------------
Free Pet - This ability removes the component cost of summoning pets.

Unsummon NPC - This ability will allow the player to unsummon or banish all
summoned NPC's in a radius.

Improved Reclaim Energy - This ability will increase the amount of mana
returned to the player when reclaiming their pet.

Air Elemental Form
Earth Elemental Form
Water Elemental Form
Fire Elemental Form
Elemental Form Fire - This ability will allow the player to turn into this
elemental type gaining many of the benefits innate to the NPC.

Frenzied Burnout - This ability allows the player to cast a buff on his pet
that will cause it to go bezerk doing increased damage. When the effect
wears off the pet will explode damaging everything around it.

Quick Summoning - This ability reduces the casting time of summoning spells
by 10, 25, and 50 percent.

Pet Lay of Hands - This ability allows the player to cast a Lay of Hands
type spell on thier pet.
-------------

Well, having only a magician up to decent levels I'll give my comments on
"my" class.
Free Pet - Love this one. Will save me a couple of slots in my inv, but it's
not game-altering. Get 1 skill and never look back. Like the necro/sk
version of no-bones skellies it will be a much welcomed skill.

Unsummon NPC - The rare occasions I can use my unsummon line in a serious
group my normal nukes tend to be more effective even then. Not a good
option. Maybe if I get bored at level 60 or such.

Improved Reclaim Energy - Oh great, aside from having dozens of items with
reclaim energy I know have a no-mana cost one as well. See the note of
Unsummon NPC above.

Elemental Forms - Definate keeper ! I've always been annoyed at the fact
that the elemental masters can't become them themselves, but those wimpy
chanters could. Also a good one for some small faction adjustments for
quests. I definately like this one.

Frenzied Burnout - Aside from the "fun" aspect this is actually a good one
IMO. I'm starting to go on raids and I can see every mage using this for
taking down the ubermobs. I just hope the AoE damage doesn't hurt the tanks
(much).

Quick Summoning - Nice. It was about time casting time reducers were brought
into the game. Also a nice combination with Frenzied Burnout to do some
awesome pet-rush kind of attacks.

Pet Lay on Hands - COOL. This will make soloing a lot easier for mages. Pets
usually have loads of health (44/49+)and our wimpy pet-heals simply don't
cut it after a while. This effectively gives you 2 pets for the price of
one, with the added benefit that the monster doesn't get a chance to run to
you (no pet -> dead mage). I know a few situations in which this one would
have saved my hide.


And there are of course the more generic ones which will be a welcome
improvement to any character. I'm just wondering if there are limits to
certain stats (HIE Mage with 200 str?)
