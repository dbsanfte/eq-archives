I can't believe that people are surprised or outraged about this.
Charm-soloing enchanters were grabbing AAs in under an hour and, in
places like BoT, two or three enchanters invising and charming could
guarantee that no one else ever got a boss MOb ever. If they were
enough of a prick (and there are plenty of mental defectives who play
the class,) they could walk in on top of a group camping a boss,
blur-train them or just outdamage them for the KS.

There has always been a rough balance between a class's desireability
in a group and their soloability. Any time a class has gotten too much
of both, SOE has brought out the nerf bat or introduced new content
that reset the balance.

I suspect that shamans are next.
