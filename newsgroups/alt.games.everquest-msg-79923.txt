Hello, I am playing a rogue and she is now 12th level but I have a lot of
questions I wonder if someone can help answer.

1.  I just got safe-fall, but how do I practice it-by falling down?  Thats
kind of embarrasing-anyway I've tried dropping off the lift and I either get
hurt, or nothing happens-I'm not getting any message telling me that I have
attempted a safe fall or anything. By the way I did put some skill points to
it at my guild so that is not the problem.

2. I want to practice hand-to-hand, but of course I really suck at it.  If I
start now, what level MOBs do I have to fight to up my skills?

3.  Do skills go up when dueling?  Can I practice hand-to-hand in a duel?  I
probably have some friends that would like to improve this skill the same
way if it would work.  Without killing each other-would skills go up if you
didn't fight to death?

4.  What is the best way to practice Pick Pocket-Another embarrasing thing
to practice-running around after rats and skellies trying pick pockets.
What a way to make a living.  Anyway, got any tips???

5. What the heck is Parry anyway?  I put some skill points toward it, but
how do I practice it?  Is it automatic while fighting?  I haven't seen any
messages telling me that I am getting better.

6. At 13th I get duel wield.  When I use backstab I get an extra attack.  If
I use duel wield, will I get three?  Or can I only use  duel wield or
backstab but not both?

Ok thats all for now.  Thanks a bunch for helpin out this Noob!
