I've got about 30-40 things I need to cover, but as a quck aside, why do =
we really need to go to war? At least why does the United States need to =
go to war?

Well based upon the verse in II Kings, which I presented recently, the =
goal of the war for the US should be only to prevent Iraq and N. Korea =
from producing weapons of mass destruction using whatever harassing =
means needed to do that.

Why? So we can continue to live that is why, don't think that all of =
this will just happen automatically, we can still lose and the human =
race can still be annihilated and if that is going to happen it will =
happen in the next 7 years. I personally am only concerned for the next =
3.5 myself though and my own safety and comfort during those years

The first danger to the continuance of the human race has been abated =
which I will go over later if I get around to it and should actually be =
fairly obvious, (namely if you don't have any children then the human =
race will eventually die) but nuclear bomb is another technology which =
has potential planet killer properties and I thought I read that N. =
Korea is even now creating a nuclear weapon based upon satellite photos =
and you people in power stand around like Superman is going to fly out =
of the sky and save the day?
