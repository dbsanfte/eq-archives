What they really need to do is make their damn
programming code more solid, then they wouldn't need
any guides. I'd build the game so solid that all I'd have to
do is keep the servers running and rake in the cash.

How the fuck can items just disappear?
Why do people, bodies and mobs get stuck below the world?
How hard is it to write some code that if an item's Z coordinate
is below the ground then put it above the ground? Corpse in the
wall? Well then move it out of the wall, duh.
