Yet 90% of all technical problems are solved by updating drivers.

There are simply too many hardware combinations out there for any game
company to code for. Unless a large (as in 25% or more) portion of the
player base is having the same problem, it is foolish to blame the
game company. Sony (like every other publisher) works to get the code
working on as many systems configs as possible. It's good business. 

If you want trouble free gaming get a PS2/XBox/GCN.
