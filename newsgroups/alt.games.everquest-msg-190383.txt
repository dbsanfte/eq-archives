> This is wrong.

    To sum up your four pages of maths, I'm off by a couple of %, and a
level 40 player grouping with a level 50 player will get slightly more than
half of the experience per kill he would get soloing?

    Your examples seem to be about classes that can't solo and about
powerlevelling, two things which don't come into this debate. I wasn't
talking about a level 40 person being powerlevelled in the hole - I was
talking about normal grouping circumstances - all mobs are dark blue to
everyone.

    I have observed the complete opposite of what you are suggesting a
number of times. If there IS a mathematical gap in favor of the lower level
character, it is insufficient to overcome normal group innefficiencies.
