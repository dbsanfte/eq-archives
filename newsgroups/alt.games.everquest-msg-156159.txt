20 years (or was it more) ago, it was Dungeons and Dragons. People
were addicted. Ooops, it caused devil worship. Ack, it was responsible
for students living in storm drains. OMG, it was responsible for the
movie Mazes and Monsters (proud moment for Tom hanks). Its too
addictive. Yes, in some ways D&D is responsible for EQ. There is the
real story, it was the devil after all.
