Grouping for xp, and it wouldn't take much of a group, I spent 42 in
Velious hunting the kodiaks in the caves out near the Velk's Lab zone.
Good xp, you can bind in Thurg, and if you pull them to the safe room
near the entrance to Velks, it's a short run to the zone line if you get
in a bad fix.
  For PP? Aside from the inevitable answer of Rath Mtns HG's, you could
fight down a ways in Paw. Lot's of fine steel drops there which sells
well. (And there's merchants right in SK.) CC can also give you some
high plat items.
