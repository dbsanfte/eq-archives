Several ways to do this.  Basically, it means to snare a creature and keep
ahead of it (usually with a speed enhancing spell or item) while you
DOT/nuke it.  You can also reverse-kite (also called fear-kiting) where you
snare the creature and cast a fear spell on it /while you DOT/nuke it.
Reverse-kiting is more efficient because you don't get the full DOT damage
unless a creature is standing still or running away from you.

Quad-kiting is snaring four similar creatures, running them around in
circles until they are right on top of each other and using an AE nuke to
hit them all at once.  Normally done by adventurous druids and wizards
around lvl39.

Mainly social reasons in my opinion.  Also, there are some creatures in EQ
that can only be taken down by groups of players.  A guild is one way of
organizing these "raids".

It used to be that porting was the domain of wizards and druids.  But with
Luclin, you can use certain wizard spires (like the one in NK) to travel to
the Nexus and from there travel to the other continents.  Wizard and druid
porting is still in demand though.  I would say the normal minimum price is
10pp.  Just shout in the zone that you are "looking for a port to XXXX".
Some players port for donations, others have a set fee.

You don't "need" it.  It adds new content, graphics, quests, a whole new
planet, travel network and race (Vah Shir).

A lot of new lvl35+ zones.

Wizards runes are similar to ench, mag and necro pages.  They are used to
research (create) certain wiz spells.
