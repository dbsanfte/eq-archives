Glad you brought this up. I just did a transfer today of a couple toons 
from one account I was not the original owner of to my main and soon to 
be only account. This is a same server account to account transfer and 
the billing info on both accounts is identical at present.

I read the thing about not doing it, etc. too and wondered if this will 
go through or not.

Anyone know how long they typically take to process transfers like this? 
The info I got from them was it could take up to 3 weeks, which seems 
ridiculous. I hope it is faster than that.
