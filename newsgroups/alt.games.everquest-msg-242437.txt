Maybe I'm just young at heart, too impatient to just 
sit tight and wait for others to catch up with me. 
When I get to full mana, I have to DO something. When
a mob is whaling on me, I try to root it, but if it 
keeps resisting, I am prone to panic; I run for the 
zone, and I have to be in control the whole way, so 
I can't take time out to /shout "TRAIN TO ZONE!!" I 
have a hotkey for that, but in the heat of flight I
may not reach it in time.
  So I get people angry. People in my guild. Including 
clerics I can't afford to anger.
  Case in point: Plane of Justice last Saturday. Doing
a trial for Bastion of Thunder access.
  The previous week, KR had raided Storms, and I was 
right behind the officers for BoT key piece drops. I
did my best to justify my status, too; I was a good 
little wizard, nuking each mob until I got LOM or 
the mob was dead, and dying with everyone else the 
two times we wiped. But moving with a crowd seems 
easy; you can get lost among the numbers.
  Not so in a single group. Heading down to PoJ
basement to get the ball rolling with Mauvin, we
found a couple of people xp'ing. How nice, we have 
an easy walk to the cell. Not - there's an Enforcer
I hadn't seen around there, which aggros on me, so I
fall quickly.
  The team soon catches up and our cleric rezzes me.
On our way out, however, we have to kill some repops.
It looks as if loot will be left to rot, so I decide
there is no harm in just picking it up. Among the
things looted is an ethereal parchment. The cleric 
notices this and objects. Opps - maybe they were going 
to take time to roll on this stuff anyway. It didn't 
seem like it, a good sixty seconds had passed with no
one saying "hold pulls for loot". And finally, when 
we get swarmed by repopping adds on our way out, I get
too many resists and early root breaks from the Enforcer
pounding on me, so I run to the zone-out. I survive, but 
the train kills one of the group camping there.
  When I get back in, the cleric gives me a royal chewing-
out, replete with "phuck you Adastrea", and disbands.
/cry. Bad feelings all around, and our guild leader is 
left to quickly dampen the talk before it infects guildchat.
  We end up getting another of our guild's clerics, one
on closer terms with me, and we get her preflagged at 
Mauvin and make our way to the Tribunal. We make several 
tries at the Trial of Execution, easily defeating the 
first wave and usually the second, but we just don't have 
the mana flow for the third. We need a more melee-heavy
group, or I need more mana regen. I've already got C4,
what I want is C5, SD, 15 levels of FT items, bard
song, a mod rod, and necro twitch. And a horse.
  Lacking any of these, it is eventually decided that 
we will make two seperate trials attempts: one with the
first wizard in our party, along with some 60's people 
in our guild, another with me and a different cleric
(the other wizard was on the same account as a cleric 
who also needed Trials done). After several more atempts,
the first Trial is completed, but it is too late for
a second attempt; I am falling asleep at the keyboard.
Next weekend, maybe.
  Be a man. Don't mope, work the problem.  Hmmmm. Maybe 
if I can get a guild group together for the Lost Temple 
of Cazic Thule, we can get Boots of Flowing Slime. And 
manipulating the Hollowshade Moor wars could get me a 
shoulder piece with FT3. Then there's still my epic...
and a horse might be affordable for under 10k...
  
  Some work did pay off last night: with the help of a 
guildie necro, I finished the quest for the level 39 
wizard spell Concussion. This should take aggro off me 
next time we do Trials. 
  And gratz on Ada getting CoV faction to amiable. The 
Kromrif and Kromzek couldn't hate me more, of course.
A lot of this was build up watching over a group camping
the frost giant fort in GD. I could nuke wolf adds 
straight to death, and take off 25-33% of a giant's
health to help the kill rate. I'm sure they loved me.

  Now back to farming my KR faction...
