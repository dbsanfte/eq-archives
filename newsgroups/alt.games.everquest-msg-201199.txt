Perhaps I should clarify then, if you don't mind my speaking for myself 
rather than you trying to do so for me here. I *do* think that the downtime 
is a good thing in that it is a necessary evil. It is better in my mind to 
have a bit of a build up to a bigger xp payoff than to be able to kill a 
constant stream of sub-light-blue caliber mobs while your xp bar creeps 
along almost imperceptibly.
