Dual wielding Lammy's at 20th!!! Jeez I'm 51 and just got my first. Damn
Twinks ;ï¿½)

Actually dual wielding centi longswords is better at 20th (and stays this
way till 40)
Reason is your prim hand damage bonus isn't good enough to offset the better
dam/del ratio of the Centi. Personally, if you have the cash, go for Centi
in primary and Lammy in offhand then swap over as you get to 40 (the Centi
makes a better offhand weapon anyway bu twhile your DW is still improving)
