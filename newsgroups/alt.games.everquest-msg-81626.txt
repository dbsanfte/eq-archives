I used the portal for the first time last night and my computer locked-up
immediately after getting the "Loading please wait..." message.  I ended up
having to re-boot my pc and took a long time to get back into the game
because it kept saying I had an "Active Character".  Luckily I had invis'd
before the portal activated.  When I finally made it back into the game, I
was surprised that no one had warned that there would be giants and wolves
right at the spires!

Did anyone else lock-up during the trip to Velious portal?  Probably just my
pc but I'm leery about trying that again if it is a bug.
