He's not wrong.  /sigh this is why you think people are being rude, 
because you make bold factual statements without really providing any 
evidence.

Mana is used at the *end* of spell casting when the spell fires, or when 
it fizzles.  If the spell doesn't end or fizzle, it doesn't cost any 
mana, regardless of class (bards excepted, no one knows how bards work, 
even bards).
