    No. Let's assume a mob has 8 pp, 10 gp, 1 cp. Your successful picks will
look roughly like this: 4 pp, 2 pp, 1 pp, 5 gp, 3 gp, 1 gp. You usually get
half (rounded up) of the highest coin type a mob has, and you can't pick a
mob below 1 of a coin type it has. That is how people can tell with stupid
rogues - they'll loot and get 1 pp 1 gp 1 cp, and go "ah, PP'ing rogue!" The
easy way to avoid this is to only successfully PP each mob ONCE. If you only
get gold, or one pp, that mob wasn't worth it anyways. If you get multiple
plat, then when the mob dies that's a mob you loot. So you get a small
amount of coin/an item off every mob AND all the loot (or the bulk of it, if
you use autosplit) off the rich ones.

    Every rogue in HHK is branded a PPer because the goblins have something
valuable that can be picked - the ears. So everyone assumes you're after
them. The goblins, being overcons, also have a loot table that's much better
than most of those people there have ever seen before. So again, of course
they're going to think you're there to steal all the phat lewts.

    Did you clean corpses (pick down to one of each coin)? Was anyone else
getting ears? It's all about being subtle.

    Groups know you can, but groups want to believe you aren't. If you're
subtle, they won't be able to tell and will gladly believe the lie they want
to believe. And while you won't make out like a bandit (pun intended),
you'll do quite well over the course of the evening.
