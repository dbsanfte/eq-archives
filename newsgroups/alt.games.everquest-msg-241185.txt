Then why doesnt someone just post the link weekly, or with the polite
request to please not top post [or whatever you dont want them to do or
not do] instead of lighting their nosehairs?

But I have been on usenet for years, and pretty much any group I read 
posts a weekly faq/faq update/request for stuff to add to the faq. I can 
honestly say that [just as a wild example] in the 8 years that I have 
been on the Rialto [rec.org.sca] they have always posted the weekly faq, 
and there was never a autogenerated welcome posting telling me to go 
read the faq...it just appears one a week=) And I am perfectly happy 
blaming Bill Gates and AOHell for everything, including my husbands 
dandruff=)
