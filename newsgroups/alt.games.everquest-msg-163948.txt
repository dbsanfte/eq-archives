    They did have a form of this with the message boards in places like
Qeynos and High Keep. But not many people knew they even existed, and they
were very inconvenient for transmitting messages.

    Gambling was rejected by the devs for legal reasons (plat is sold on
playerauctions so it has a value that can be established in court, and many
juristictions where EQ is played have anti-gambling laws). Originally it was
going to be implemented in High Pass.

    It saves the clip plane for me. When you log back in with the new UI it
LOOKS like you have clipping out to max, but if you tap shift-minus once
it'll bounce right back to how it should be. If you actually lost your
setting, hitting shift-minus would only take the clipping plane in one
notch.
