The issue of this thread, however, is the naming policy. A policy that
exists with reason and that is not difficult to follow, nor does it
compramise any rights. It is not a rule that intrudes on the personal

voluntary leisure activity.

And I'd like to see some concrete proof to the contrary... Now, quit
trying to steer away from the point of the thread.
