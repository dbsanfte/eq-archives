As said above -- stun (melee or spell), mezz. That works if they are
suceptible to these techniques. If not -- burn them dead. Of course there's
another method available to enchanters and (for me) it seems to work most of
the time, with the exceptions of high planes -- using spinstun, that doesn't
have a level cap and works on mobs that are "immune to stun portion of this
effect".. They will resist on most of mobs unles you tash them, but after
tash even lvl 12 Whirl till you hurl works and  doesn't cost much mana
either. (That's my spell of choice since for some woerd reason lvl 29 DDD
seems to resist much more and doesn't interrupt casting as successfully). I
cannot say I have this spell up at all times, but in LDoN or at the point
where I know there're gaters...

Now, in my own turn I have a question -- pertaining NickyD's post to fight
them at the spawn point -- in LDoN  I have faced this problem numerous times
that mob will be fought at the spawn point (we knew for a fact that
he/she/it wasn't a wanderer) and yet it will gate further down into dungeon
and bring his friends (pally forgot to cast, hehe. As an enchanter I love
these moments, hehe...) Ok, now -- am I imagining things? Or did someone
have similar situation? (mostly that happens in MM LDoN with Necros gating
out).
