I've been working on the Leatherfoot raiders skullcap quest out of
Rivervale. I've gotten 3 of the 4 skins and the Dragoon dagger sitting in my
bank, but have not been able to get an alligator skin from a Bull alligator
in Innothule swamp. I've killed about 20 so far and seen no skin. I know
someone in this group hinted at a MOB who would only drop it's prize if it
was attacked with a blunt weapon (Is this it?) so I've been using a 1hb to
kill the Bull alligator. Has anyone gotten an alligator skin recently? Is
this quest broken, or does the skin drop from another MOB? Any help would be
appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve
