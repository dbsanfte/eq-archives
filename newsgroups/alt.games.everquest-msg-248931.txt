The FV server comes with an *extremely* high price tag: Trivial Loot Code.

It's a great server if you're not concerned about how many quests TLC will
spoil for you, though.

It also comes with another extremely high price tag: one character only.
Two character slots would be better: it wouldn't seriously affect the
economy/twinking situation, and would give players at least a little
variety.

It also comes with a stupid/annoying price tag: languages.  Be prepared
for some stupid, repetitive language lessons.
