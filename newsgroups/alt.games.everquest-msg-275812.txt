First of all thank you to everyone for good advice and discussion.
I joined EverQuest and created my first character as a dark elf necromancer.
I wonder there are too many of us in Norrath. Anyways, I am happy with her
so far (lev.5)

It was the first time on the field last night, someone cast a spell on me
"dead man floating" which is awful long 70minuets effect. What does it do
beside of floating me? Any harm? I looked up my book but didn't see such
spell. Who cast it anyways?

Right now I have EQ classic, Ruins of Kunark and the scars of velious. How
is it benefiting me adding so many expansions at this early stage? I figured
I can use journal and maybe more spell choices even low level?

It is funny this is my first MMORPG, I am not good at typing in the game.
Some kind man cast me buffing spell, by the time I notes and typed thanks,
he was gone.
So let me say thanks here.
BTW, I am female player, is it mostly boys society??(Those ooc comments made
me wonder)
