Kinda hard to beat 30 FR 30 cold Resist 30 magic Resist and a few
extra points of mana per tick, and thats just from the 54 one.

The proble is AOE kills it.  And honestly the only reason to have +30
resist buffs up is for aoe'ing mobs.  Another brainless move in the
name of 'Heh, lets make something so completely backward the players
wont know wtf the point is of casting this spell is.
