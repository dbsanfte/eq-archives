eep, my bad, yes, 30 sec cast.  Wrote all this stuff down on a sheet of
paper, must have miscopied the time

I'd love to see a discussion of this.  I've been wearing it for the stats,
not the med bonus, but some people say the bonus is effective and some say
it isn't.  I'd particularly like to see some evidence one way or the other
in the post POP era... you say "capped at level 60" but I'm 63 now... and
the skill itself capped out some time before I hit 60, so that wouldn't
make sense either.

I really got my money's worth out of these back in my early 50s, 220 hp
heal every 12 seconds could keep a partner alive forever, with a very
occaisional Cheal which I'd more than med back even standing there
clicking.

Like a young shaman using his HP buff for a heal, eventually I finally got
to where I'd med up more heals sitting and popping up to heal than I'd ever
get out of this strategy.... and now they are really just 21 AC nothing,
probably should be number one on my "replace this" list.

Ext Range was well worth any cost in terms of HP/mana/AC... but its slowly
becoming less so as more and more of my spells are too high level for the
effect.  Funny thing is, the spells I still really care about range on are
all focus I or II.... CHeal, Root, Stun; if there's an item I could swap
around and get focus II it wouldn't be any worse than focus III, since my
DD and my fast heals are all IV level now.

I'm looking around for a good bracer for this slot and I can just carry the
SSA for those occaisions where the extra range is going to make a
difference.

Aye, its 1% less haste, but isn't embarassing stats wise for a cleric
belt.  Not great, but not terrible, and you've got haste all the time.

I kept seeing people say Shadel rings for 1Kpp or so in this forum, but
have never seen one on MT for less than 6500pp, and that seems awful
steep.  Where do they drop in FG, off what mob, I doubt there's much in the
zone I can't solo or find a partner to help camp.  Heck, partner would
probably make decent exp.

7 wis is a bit more mana than 30, but trading a little mana for 30 HP and 5
AC would probably be worth it.

Its more conveinient than I thought.  Not so much the mana free part
(Abundant drink spends less mana than I med up while casting it) but the
fact that I don't have to unmem something, open spell book and page to the
"non critical spells" section, mem spell, cast cast cast unmem spell page
back to "important swap spell" and mem that again... and there are also
some stats (tiny ones) where the Donals Boots I was wearing had the same AC
and no stats.

There's something to look for I guess, that would be a nice chunk of extra
mana and it doesn't seem like my AC does anything at all on POP mobs
anyway.

Its a pretty easy quest, although a little harder with the harmony nerf.
The problem is finding the scout up with no bag in hand.  Get together a
hunting party (OK, in my case, druid partner) to go after Ice Burrowers,
though, and bind yourself at the SG line, you can check her frequently,
then its just a question of scrambling a group to get the captain before
someone else gets to her.
