    The bonus was supposed to make up the difference between a solo
character's XP rate (where the solo character is all DPS), and a group's XP
rate (where some members of the group are support, and do not contribute the
same DPS). It did not. It was therefore inadequate.

    If after working hard all year long your employer threw you a quarter
and called it your yearly bonus, you too may find a bonus to be inadequate!
The bonus was supposed to be sufficiently high such that one of those happy
solo classes, like druids, would find more benefit in a group than outside a
group. It didn't work that way.

    Oh, please don't start with "roleplay reality" analogies. They just give
everyone headaches. Suffice it to say that the creators of the game wanted
people to get more out of grouping than out of soloing.

    AKA duoing. ;-)

    The game is slanted towards the high end because, guess what, we all end
up there. Unless you're the worst player in the world, you won't be spending
endless hours killing bats in front of your home town. So there's no reason
to make all new places to kill bats, because players don't spend enough time
doing that to see all the places in game as it is.
