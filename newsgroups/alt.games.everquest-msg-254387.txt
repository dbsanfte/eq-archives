Honestly, I'm not sure how hard people are trying, but I find most 
people have a hard time keeping aggro off me unless I keep dumping it 
off with a jolt axe.

Really amusing was when I pulled a mob, got it stuck on a group who was 
fighting in the passageway on my way back, managed to drag it back off 
them, ran to the group, SK got on it, I jolted, and the mob turned and 
ran back into the passage in search of the other fight!

You have to remember, this is a low to mid 20s group we are talking 
about, there's no Cheal, and there's not as much difference as you're 
used to between one class and another in terms of what kind of damage 
mitigation they do.  Spreading heals around between the tanks doesn't 
really cost any more in this kind of scenario than healing just the MT. 
  The not being able to sit down thing is a different story... but that 
wasn't happening, the tank cluster could keep aggro fine, it was just 
that the MT couldn't keep it from the other tanks in the group, even 
though we weren't trying to take it away.

In the long run, your mana pool has nothing to do with your need to med. 
  If you have a pool that's 5 Cheals deep, and call for a med break when 
you get down to 2 Cheals, then you have to med up as much as 3 Cheals 
worth.  If you have one that's 10 Cheals deep and still call for that 
same med break, then you can either med to 5 as before (in which case 
your pool effectively becomes just 5 cheals deep from this point on), or 
you can med more than twice as long and get back up to full.  Either 
way, you end up medding the exact same amount of minutes per hour.

To change this, instead of a better mana pool, you need better mana 
regen and/or better use of your mana.  A drogmar, outdoors, will often 
help enormously.  Getting KEI is a classic (although if you're committed 
to the idea of using only the resources of your party, and don't happen 
to have a high level enchanter in there, its out of bounds).  FT items 
help, as do AA that increase regen rate, or improve healing efficiency. 
  A better equipped/buffed MT can help.  Cutting the CHeals closer to 
the fine line can help (and can hurt, if you end up blowing lots of mana 
rezzing and rebuffing)  Better slow and slow landed earlier can help. 
List goes on and on; the point is, spend less, get more back per tic, 
thats how you can change things so you don't have to med so much; 
changing mana pool won't make any difference except in the short run.
