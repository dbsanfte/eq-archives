Cash, check out the Aqua Goblins in Butcherblock. Should be easy at
your level, and you should be able to come up with a fair bundle of
backbones, vials of blood, heads, and steins in a couple hours. Each
sell for around 2-3pp with decent faction and to the right vendors.
For xp, two words: Paludal Caverns. Just don't try to melee the
phlargs unless you have access to cure disease.
