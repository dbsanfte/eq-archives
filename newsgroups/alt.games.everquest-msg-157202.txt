I didn't see anyone claim SOE was selfless.  They will do what they think is
 going to get the most money in their bank accounts.  And I do not mean the
most money RIGHT NOW.  Big companies like Sony look at the very long term,
and they know damned well that means customer satisfaction.  They have
shortcomings, but I hope (and suspect) their customer base is wiser about
the way things work than squeaky wheels like yourself can imagine.  As I
said before, if you are unhappy, leave.  You will have done your part to
make it a better game in the process.
