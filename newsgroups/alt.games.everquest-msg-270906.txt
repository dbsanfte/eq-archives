Thank you very much! I am printing this post right now for handy 
reference when we go on. It turns out my friend is off all week for the 
holidays on vacation next week and I am off the weekdays too. 
Conveniently enough, he has two nice PCs right next to each other at his 
home and AO will be installed on them both when I arrive to play. That 
should be good fun. So it's probably next Tuesday right after Christmas 
that we wind up diving in. Although I am thinking I may jump in on my 
own and roll a toon to try it out before then.
