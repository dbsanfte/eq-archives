>>>SNIP<<<

1) apparantly you're trying to say it was a racist crime, then you use a
racist remark in your subject. And this makes you better than them
because......?

2) I find the diversity of the newsgroups you sent this to more intriguing:

alt.gossip.celebrities
alt.games.everquest
rec.sport.golf
alt.windows98
alt.cellular.nokia

3) this applies to Everquest how? and am I supposed to care? Because
actually, I don't. If I did, I would have been following the story on
CNN.com or MSN.com or some other news site, and would have already read Mr
Douglas' comment by now.
