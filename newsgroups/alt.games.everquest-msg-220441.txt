I bought a WMBS for 4k on BB - not hugely better than what you have
right now though.  In the 'fun Ranger toy' catergory there's quite a
few Steel Hilted Flint Daggers floating about the server now, again
the one I bought was 4k although that's far and away the cheapest I've
ever seen it.  Doesn't proc until 50 or something though.

Swiftwind.  Tons of people still have spheres from Sky rotting in
banks I bet and it can be MQ-ed easily.  Your normal xp group could do
the rest no problem.  Ok ratio, decent stats, 40% haste and 30 raw ATK
is still not to be sniffed at.  Oh and free too.

Solstice Earring.  I was going to try and do a few parts myself but
was able to find everything in bazaar for just about 3k (grats twinkie
Shaman) so that was a "no brainer". 

Eyepatch of Plunder.  Very handy solo item if you have Lodizal's spawn
timer nailed down and can contemplate camping the Iceclad Chicken.

Snare earring from Chardok is solo-able although easier to pick up for
chump change in the bazaar.  Extended Range IV necklace from PoN for
25pp *tops* for the rare occasion you might need ER.

Kylong Darkmail.  Go farm!  Enough said. :p 

Swarmcaller.  Ghetto haste for sure but something to always carry
unless you have Earthcaller.  Again try the bazaar as you'd waste
entirely too much time waiting on it to drop.

Tae Ew legs when you hit 51 or maybe those shocking pink LDoN legs.
Plenty decent chain BPs in bazaar too now since LDoN (changed days
indeed).

Amusing Bauble from the PoM yard is a decent range item for when
you're not using a bow.  Static spawn spot with placeholders and seems
to always drop off the named bixie.  Saw a nice 50 HPs/Mana ring with
Regen II drop further in but it was All/All so expect most of the
group to want in on that. :p

There's *tons* of other nice tradable stuff about these days including
range, chest and face slots with Vengeance on which was virtually
unheard of not that long ago.

I ground out a lot of xp in Chardok at zone in (best) or zone out but
you're way young for that yet solo.  I had to fear kite the dogs to be
able to keep the first half a dozen spawns clear.
