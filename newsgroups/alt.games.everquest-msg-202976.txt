Your right of course, I shouldn't give up on him. I've spent a lot of time
getting him to where he is today 17. I've scrapped up the cash to get him
all his spells, and I know how to use them, all except Harmony I must admit.
And I have about half of what I need to get his next level spells, 19 that
are coming right up. Plus all his skills,(not-trade), are for the most part
maxed for his current level. As soon as Prexus comes back on-line I will
take him and really look for groups. Now that I think of it with KEI going
for 9pp and ageo or virtue going for 20pp, I can probably afford to buy him
some new clothes or toys or both.
