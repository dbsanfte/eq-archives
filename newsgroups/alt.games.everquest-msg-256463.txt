I think you are missing the point, which wandered slightly from the 
original topic: ATM includes an initial for Machine, so ATM Machine is 
redundant, likewise PIN includes N for Number.

I say A T M and Pin, but oddly I'm more likely to say Mac than I am to 
say ATM because in my area the first ATMs' were MAC, starting with one 
bank and then spreading over most of the banks around, it was some time 
before it became a nationwide interconnected deal where you could use 
almost any type of card on an ATM almost anywhere.

I'm not alone in this, but have never when wandering in other areas 
heard Plus or any of the other networds used as a synonym for ATM the 
way MAC is around here
