	I agree.

Me too!

	EQ needs MORE distinctions between classes and races, not less,
IMHO.  For instance, why not have an evil cleric gain the ability to
CAUSE disease?  Good clerics get a group cure disease (or whatever)
instead...
	
	And druids are DPS who can heal, not healers who can't DPS
either.  Especially with the changes to some nukes and rain spells.  
Druid healing is more or less sufficient I think, lacking perhaps a 
useful HOT to buffer with.


	AS far as gear goes, I'd like to see them get off the mana/hitpoints
treadmill and offer more useful magic effects.  For instance, picture
an encounter whose boss mob uses a powerful rain spell.  Single groupable
with some luck and an extra healer in the group, or single groupable if
one of those healers has the Blessed Umbrella of UberMobRaidMob_63 whose
specific effect is to...mitigate rain spells....
