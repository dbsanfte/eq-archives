House Archon on Torvonnilous. But, you'd also better avoid Blades of
Wrath, Nexxus of Faith, Immortals Rising, New Dawn Rising,
Thermopylae, Voices Within, Riffraff, Darkstar Alliance, Heretics of
the Ages, Blood and Guts, and the twenty or so other raiding guilds
that have the same policy.

Of course, that will pretty much leave you grouping with the players
who don't raid and share your attitude, none of whom I can actually
remember meeting.
