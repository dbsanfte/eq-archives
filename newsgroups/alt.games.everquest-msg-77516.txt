    My enchanter Charms, too, in self-defence. There's usually one moron who
won't stop beating on a mez, so Charm it instead. Then walk the pet off to
one side and park it. Whatever player follows the pet/nukes the pet is the
moron. If nothing else the pet isn't trying to kill me for a little while.
