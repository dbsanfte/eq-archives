No, chris, this is called a 'deflection'.  Instead of either proving
his is right in some concrete manner or simply admitting his talking
out of his ass, Moses here is trying to deflect criticism that is
directed at him onto you by pointing out what a insensitive asshole
you are because you made a retard joke, or more to the point, posted a
link to a retard joke.  My money says that he could give two fucks for
the plight of the mentally challenged, this was just a convenient
diversion.

And for the record, the joke was mean and insensitive.  It was also
pretty funny, and surprisingly accurate.  :-)

Don't forget the mustard.
