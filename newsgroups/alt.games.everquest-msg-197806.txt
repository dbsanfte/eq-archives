I got accused of ks'ing the other day and want to hear if others think he
may have had any kind of point.  We were pulling to entrance hall of kc and
some guy came running by us with a construct and it's pet.  He zones out
with no train warning (right side no less).  We figure that the construct
had to have aggroed us as it went by so we went to killing it.  A little
ways into the fight his group comes round the corner from right moat and
starts wailing on the mob.  We figure this mob has already done us damage
and wasted our mana so it's ours.  We end up getting the xp but get called
ks'ers.  The guy claimed he was "zone-pulling".  Can anyone tell me why he
would want to use such a tactic, and more to the point does anyone think he
still has rights to the mob after he zones?
