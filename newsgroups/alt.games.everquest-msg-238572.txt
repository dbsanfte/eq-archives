I agree with what you have to say Ben, but I found thi sline kind of funny.
Last night my guild was doing Rallos Zek in Tactics.  There is a script to
spawn the real RZ, part of it is fighting Tallon Zek.  He has a frontal ae
that does an obcene amount of damage, something like 3k, so it is important
to keep him walled so he is only facing the MT.  This last fight after
enrage, one of the casters got aggro and TZ turned around and hit everyone
with his ae twice.  I dropped down to 1% health and when I asked my cleric
to heal me, she was like "oh, I though you died."   It was kind of funny in
a
a-big-chunk-of-your-raid-just-died-and-now-they-need-to-be-rezed-and-rebuffe
d-before-the-next-mob-is-pulled-because-the-event-is-timed kind of way.  It
is, however, nice to know that my stat food was the difference between life
and death.
