Hi,


    I just copied all of my old hardrives eq files onto a new hardrive.  The
old one was running windows 98 and the new one is XP.  How do i get eq
reqistered in the new reqistry?  I think that i did just that but right after i
type in my password and hit and try to go further it crashes me to the desktop.
 Any help would be appreciated.
