An empire is distinguished from a nation-state, at least in my reading,
in that it consists of a heterogenous collection of peoples (i.e.
multiple cultures) held together by force or the threat of force.
By that definition we still qualify, just ask the remnants of the
American Indian cultures we absorbed by force.  There doesn't seem
to be as much cultural independence in the "Old South" as there used
to be, but it's not gone yet, and they were certainly held in the
Union by force in the 1860s.  And it doesn't look to me like the
remnants of Mexican culture in the southwest (also absorbed by force)
have disappeared yet.

Next question.
