Actually, druids and shaman get the same heal spells at the same level up 
until level 58, where druids get the better gimp ch.  At 60 druids get 
Natures Touch, shaman get Torpor.  With LoY, shaman get the mini torpor 
at level 44 I think.  At level 58 is where the druid starts to get better 
at healing than a shaman.
