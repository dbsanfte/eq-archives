What sense of achievement? Looking up the quest in Allak? Waiting until 
enough people are bored enough to do a non-Cleric epic raid? The only 
sense of achievement I got out of getting my own epic was killing the 
Corrupted Cyclops, being the first time I soloed a summoning mob. All 
the other "epic" fights were soloed by a friendly Monk in sub-Time gear.

I generally agree with your sentiment, but I think that the Epic quests 
are designed to pretty much minimize any sense of achievement. At least, 
the Berserker epic has fights that one must face alone... I wish all 
other epic quests were along these lines.
