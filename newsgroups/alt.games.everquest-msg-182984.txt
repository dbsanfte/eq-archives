Much the same as shooting someone in the back, nothing is won or
proven other than a lack of character.

One persons tactics are anothers cowardice. Not hard to tell which is
which just listen to /ooc a while. 

Seems the PvP servers get the two extremes complete fuckwads and those
that play with a sense of honor. Best PKer I ever saw hunts single in
"your" backyard and never gloats. Personally one on one or one on two
appeals to me on a roll play sense,  which is why Im there. The best
way to role play IMHO. 

The good thing is most PKers "tend" not to level past their classes
peak. Seems when the necros and other casters start becoming a real
force they lose their backbone. Heh Necro is a easy kill at 13 and
death from above at 34 same with other classes. They also tend to hunt
in the same zones over and over so keep your money in the bank and
just level, your day will come.  

Now if I could figgure out how to kill a good bard or get that MR to
150 lol.
