There are no basic smithing supplies in Qeynos.
In Erudin, ore and sharpening stones are sold by an outdoor vendor.  Her
last name of Orefinder.  Expect to pay 4 cp per sharpening stone.  The
merchants in Erudin won't like you much and will overcharge you, so buy/sell
everything in Qeynos before you board the ship.

Going through Blackburrow at level 7 shouldn't be a problem as long as they
don't fall down a hole or get caught in a passing train.  Very few problems
for those just passing through.

The worst realistic threat to a level 7 in the Qeynos Hills would be to run
into Tovax Vmar and his pet.  That, or to start killing wolves and bears,
and get caught by Holly Windlstalker.
