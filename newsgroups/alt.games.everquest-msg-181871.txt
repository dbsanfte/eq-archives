I can completely understand and appreciate that. But as you say, it's
very different from Jame's real example in this thread. Getting some
friends and doing something hard with minimal forces "just to see if you
can" is great fun. I've participated in some myself. Hell, we tried to
do Harla Darr with six people, and that was before PoP. We got smoked
like salmon five times in a row, but it was still fun.

I read parts of the server board thread on the encounter that James is
talking about. I'm not blind to the fact that such a thing as zerging
exists. And I'll also agree that I'd be more proud of taking down a
tough mob with fewer forces and a really good strat. But even if this
guild alliance was, in fact, parachuting unrezzed casters into the event
to keep nuking and dying until they won a suicidal war of attrition....
so fucking what? Was it the classiest or most skillful way to do it?
Certainly not. But at the end of the day, the mob died and they got the
flags they were after.

I still maintain that, until I see or hear otherwise, it sounds like
their guild is just bitching because they don't have the fourth tier
content to themselves and/or have to share it with people they feel are
"less worthy" than them.  For fuck's sake... that really *does* sound
like something that would have come straight out of Furor's mouth.
