My playing skill has absolutely nothing to do with anything.  I let names
like Gotta Headache or Abadaz Drooid pass, but if I see Wannaphuk Nitely
parade by me in-game, I will petition it.  I wouldn't even have to stop what
I was doing, since I can type the whole petition message between Bashes or
use NumLock to keep running.  Exactly how does my playing skill relate to my
inclination to petition vulgar names?  You said I was grasping at straws,
well perhaps you can explain what you're doing here.

And who says it's "other peoples [error yours] game"?  I am playing,
therefore it is my game as much as it is any other player's.  Saying I
should leave vulgar names intact because it's their business and not mine is
like saying I should let my next door neighbors keep me awake all night with
their stereo because it's not my business. Vulgarity without cause offends
me, as being kept awake all night would. Both push things on me that bother
me and both will be reported to the authorities.

Speaking of the authorities, you should consider that, from the point of
view of ALL players, EQ is "other peoples [again, error yours] game":
Verant's. They developed it, they made the rules, and they will enforce
them. If you cannot handle the concept of rules, you should g0 lo4ck 2
qu4k3m47ch1ng.  GMs can't be everywhere, and I, for one, will help them with
things I think they need to know. These points have already been made; you
would do well to read threads in which you respond.

If you want to give your character a lame or vulgar name, that is your
right.  Nobody can stop you from physically typing it in, and no one can
program a perfect name filter, so sooner or later, if you want a bad name,
you will get it. However, it is the right of any player to petition any lame
or vulgar name, including yours, and it is Verant's right to change, ban, or
otherwise alter any name they feel is inappropriate. You are in this game by
choice. You know what the rules are. If you violate them, you are the only
party responsible for your unhappiness at having your violations corrected.
Put simply: You are free to give authority the finger, but if you do so, you
have absolutely zero -- that's right, not a little, not a lot, but ZERO --
right to complain if authority grabs your extended finger and breaks it off.

If you need to think of me as a lamer or an ass-kisser or whatever the
d00dspeak term for it is, you go right ahead. I will continue to play,
continue to enjoy myself, and continue to report violations. So will many
other people.

(A small aside: if you DO think of me as a lamer, consider that you have
chosen to rebel in a fake world where the worst thing that can happen is you
don't get to play a game any more. That's pretty lame. Go rebel in the real
world. Impress us with your daring and your contempt for authority. We'll
impress you with the speed and ferocity of our response. Deal?)

Um, check the thread.  I am in the majority.  People do agree and
understand.

Rather than an insult, my statement was an attempt to show someone that his
method of debate is ineffective.  If I use reason to point out the flaws in
someone's argument, the proper response for him is to use reason to point
out the flaws in MY argument.  "Shove it up your ass" falls far short of
accomplishing that and indicates that he is either unwilling or unable to
debate.  If he is unwilling to debate he should not continue.  If he is
unable to debate I suggest he learn how. Until then, he will make a fool of
himself, and you will make a fool of yourself by speaking up for him.

I dare you to come up with a response that's even halfway intelligent.
