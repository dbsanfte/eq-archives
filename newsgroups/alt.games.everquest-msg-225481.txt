No older than some of the rest of us.

I get the "come here" messages, I didnt realise I should have paid for
my name to be "fido" .. 

Over the last week I grouped with a few people I hadnt before and I
was astounded at how they went around LDoN.

Group1 - didnt speak, didnt loot, the MT had time gear so, basically
he mashed through them with the rest of us comparitively tickling the
mobs and event was over quicker than it took to get a mission he
wanted.

Group2 - we had a scream, jokes, laughs

Personally, while I liked knowing the mission was guarenteed win in
group1, it took all the fun out of playing EQ, if I played EQ like
that all the time Id have been bored with it years ago.

So, while Group2 took a bit longer, we had far more fun, and, Id
rather group with them and put my life in their hands any day.
