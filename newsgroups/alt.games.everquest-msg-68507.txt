AMD 1200, 512, GF2MX400(64).   Yup, last night as of the previous patch.
Running seems a little...weird...slower I guess.  Turning takes too long,
falling is slower.  But we're getting about a patch a day so I didn't figure
on mentioning it.

A couple days ago I turned TnL back on to see if that'd help my other
problems, but it didn't.  It's still on, I'm going to try to remember to
turn it off tonight to see if  that helps with THIS problem. :)  Not holding
my breath though.
