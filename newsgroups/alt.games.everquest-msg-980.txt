Ah, yes...I was about to suggest going to Everfrost for a mammoth hunting
party, too.

Another thing that can be done is to work on a trade skill to flesh out the
character a little.  Brewing and tailoring are always a fun combination, and
though it doesn't lead to level advancement, it can be fun to sell/give
stuff away to those who are lower level than you.  Making patchwork,
studded, and raw silk armor available to lowbies always brightens their day
:-)
