My current alt of the day is a 38 gnome

However, I also have a few other characters.  I'm aware of what
you are talking about, and my suggestion won't work everywhere,
but it will help a good deal in a good many zones.

Splendid, 38 mage
Llyric, 57 bard
Paax, 52 shaman
Matte, 30 enchanter
Srimp, 34 druid
Bergh, 65 cleric
