If you aren't comparing it to anything else then what interest is
it?  The whole point of this post is to find some of the best
ways to make pp; worse, better, best are comparing words.

I find Frost Giants average about 4pp each, between cash (up to
5pp) and occaisional weaponry, heads and toes.  While there are
worse cash camps out there (lots of them) its hardly in the
"best" range either.  I can't take them down particularly
quickly, I actually have to med between kills.  Compare that to
Nektulos guards where every single one drops a 3pp weapon plus
some small change, average is again 4pp, but my pet can solo them
if I don't want to speed things up with a nuke, the only limiting
factor is their spawn rate.  I doubt that I can get enough 4pp
frosties killed per hour to match the spawn rate of Nektulos,
though.

As a bard, things are radically different, you are limited more
by the availability of mobs than by any other factor; the more
mobs the faster each dies, the harder they hit the faster they
kill each other off for you.  Its a different game... as my 57
bard knows well.  My mage, though, has to worry bout tankin -and-
nukin, how hard they hit, what their resists are, and how many hp
they have are all pertinant.

In a group doing giants I fill an additional role many overlook;
I lay waste to the placeholders with ease.  My pet can solo all
varieties of lizardman and basilisks without breaking a sweat,
and takes only a little longer to down giant skeletons, Cyclops
are the only PH that even drag his HP bar down noticably and he
can even solo them, although I tend to help out because I want
him in good shape when giants pop.  We just pick a spot where
lots of stuff spawns, and I keep the area clear of PH, giants pop
fairly regularly right on top of us, so there's no concern about
what the other groups there are doing.  Anyone can do this job,
of course, but pet classes are better suited for it because we
can meditate with little interruption, the pet killing doesn't
eat into the regen time of anyone in the group.

Solo, though, its still iffy whether I can take down a HG at all,
and I have to med a lot; I'm not making all that much per hour
despite an average drop of 15pp between cash and weapons, and I'm
seriously risking death.

I'm very interested in the rest of the world.  GD is a very nice
one, given that its right off POK, so I'm not far from book
travel if an LDoN call comes up (best cash and exp I've found so
far is LDoN... if you discount the time to form the group).  But
killing there seems to be about the same cash as anywhere else,
which is to say a good way to make a few hundred pp.  Since I
need a few thousand (heck nearly ten thousand) I was hoping for
something more cash oriented, even if it doesn't result in exp or
faction.
