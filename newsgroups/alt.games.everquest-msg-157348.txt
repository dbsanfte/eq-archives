Well that appears to be a sound-distance thing... like Sony/Verant have
defined a maximum distance you can hear that is now much shorter than
it was before...

...and it is a pain in the bloody arse (or ass as I believe you guys call
it!)

I've been able to put one death down to that already (attacked by a high
level creature from behind before I heard a thing) and I'm sure there will
be many more.  *8-(

Plus, it simply _sounds_ wrong, I can hear rather further then 20 feet away,
which is about as far as you can now hear in EQ!
