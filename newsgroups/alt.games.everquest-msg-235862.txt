>Are rangers good for solo lvl 20 and up?

Rangers get snare and fear (animals), so they can fear kite animals.  The
can also bow kite (snare and then shoot arrows) although at low levels this
can be slow and expensive.

They can self-heal and self-buff, so if you find the right mobs you can
fight toe-to-toe and then heal up and fight again (although downtime can be
very long).

As they level, they get better at soloing because their options increase.

Not the best solo class, but yes, they can solo.
