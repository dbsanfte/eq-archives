They did it to stop both monks and guardians raising their agility to silly 
levels. I have sene a video clip of a monk solo'ing a epic mob in the mid 
40's. The monk was able to just stand there and take everything without 
being hit.

The entire scout class is all over the place, predators are supposed to be 
behind wizards/warlocks as the best dps class. Instead you have 
monks/brawlers/guardians all getting better dps and also the ability to 
tank!

Heritage quests are nice I agree. But the VAST majority of quests are awful. 
Who the hell came up with the books quests? Kill ten mobs, new page, kill 
the same ten mobs again, new page, kill the same ten mobs again.

Carpentry has SO many possiblities, yet the implementation by SoE is 
shocking. 6 months since the game was released and I still cant lace shelves 
correctly or put books in bookcases. The list of problems with carpentry is 
a on going joke amongst crafters. I can only think of the sage class that is 
possibly in a worse position. The big crafting patch recently made changes 
to EVERY class expect carpentry. SoE then promised that 'something big' was 
going to happen to carpentry, 2 patches on and nothing.
