Weird. I dont have a druid, however I know that ToV would suck without the one
level 60 druid our guild currently has. She has critical nukes and heals (the
AA type thingy which is always fun ;) ), is vital for transport, provides POTG 
and Circle of Seasons and has had sufficient flexibility to fill in for clerics,
wizards and even enchanters when the primary classes have all managed to get
themselves killed or OOM on occasion.

I figure ToV is pretty much the end game at the moment. She not only suffices
there; She's regularly a vital member, to the degree that when she talks about
wanting to change faction people get worried.

Sure, we'd carry on if she wasn't there in a way we wouldn't if, for example,
all our warlords mysteriously delevelled overnight, but to say she's 
"marginalised" (in fact, I was talking about claims of "uselessness", but I
think it applies to "marginalisation" as well) is far from the truth. FWIW
the guild is +Kael, not CoV so its not happy-easy-HoT stuff either.

Geee, Silly me. I'll go back to hunting orc pawns then.

Sui, only level 58 and having a blast in Velious and Luclin
