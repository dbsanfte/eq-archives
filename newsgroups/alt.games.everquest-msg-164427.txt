Yeah, damn that "expansionist" US for its nefarious expansions
over the last half century like, um...  granting statehood to
territory it had owned since it paid for it in 1867 (Alaska)
and a set of islands which had been annexed back in 1898 (Hawaii).

And like, um, wait, I'm sure there are other examples.

Ah, you must be talking about times we've won wars and then
annexed the losing country.  No, come to think of it, we
didn't, did we?  We left them with self-rule.

Hmm...
