I am a level 36 warrior looking for equipment. Please tell me of any
equipment that I should look into. This includes quest equipment or mob no
drop equip. I dont care. I am untwinked so cannot afford any thing insane. I
am currently equiped in a suit of crafted armor I earned, and Ebon Razor,
and a Sap of Piety. Please tell me of anything....and just for my hopes
someday, feel fre tp include expensive items that I can work toward. Thank
you in advance.
