It strikes me bard/shaman would be a killer combo, you'd have stackable dots, root
(man would my bard love a root song) resist debuffs, snare (for when those roots
break... wouldn't my shaman love snare!) crowd control, single pulling capability
(now that Lull line is working fairly well) SOW (selos is great for running long
distances but it sucks as a working tool) and great mana regen... shaman using
canna while getting the double dose of HP plus mana regen along with pulsed mana.

If you wanted to melee, the shaman has a healthy kit bag of melee enhancing  buffs
and real heals, and the bard has a fantastic taunt (charm and release) so the
shaman can safely add his melee damage in to the mix

Llyric, 42 bard, looking for a shaman partner to try this out with!
