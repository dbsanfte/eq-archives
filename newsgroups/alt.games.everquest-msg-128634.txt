Really???? It was Wall of the Sky, Wall of the Eye (Though that may be
backwards... brain cell failing) While it was certainly one of his
darkest works, and this is one *seriously* dark writer we're talking
about here, I would hardly have termed it the unfinished work of a
college student. I found all the short stories in there to be real page
turners.

If you haven't already, pick up Girl in Landscape, the one about the
family who relocates to a colony on a different planet. It was one of
his best, I thought, aside from Gun with Occasional Music. (My first
Letham read, and still my favorite.)
