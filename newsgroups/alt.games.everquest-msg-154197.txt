Well, it was our best guess. It's so rare very few have even seen it
once, let alone enough times to get a read on what is happening. I
last saw it the last time I was hunting SK regularly... three years
ago.

Since it dates to release it doesn't seem likely to be a triggered
event (most of EQ being pretty static back then) so it was our best
guess; aggro worked weird when mobs hurt other mobs.

It could be deliberate, though. It would be unique to SK if it was,
but it could be.
