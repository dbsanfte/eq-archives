 What is basically means is before you make an assumption on "GetsumJ"
posting as "LG", utilizing the possability of an exchange server between his
Home, and His work, maybe you should take time to calculate the actual
distance between the two servers. In this case, the distance is about 1822
miles, give or take a 2% margin of error on the software. Bottom line , IPs
are everything .

 Maybe your just a tad paranoid.
