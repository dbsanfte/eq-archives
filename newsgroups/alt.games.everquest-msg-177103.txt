That's just fine at your level. Most new players at that level don't
have the money, or really the need either, for any serious resist gear.
You won't be fighting any mobs that are so tough with magical abilities
that it will stop you from killing them, and normal resists won't stop
their attacks much anyway.  You'll only have to worry about this
significantly when you get up towards raiding levels. At that point,
you'll want to be able to get most of your resists up over 100 with just
your own gear and buffs.
