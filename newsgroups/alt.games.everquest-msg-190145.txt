(Snip a huge post down to one line)

100% effective taunt should never happen.  That would trivialize far
too much content, from ordinary grind groups to endgame raids.

It'd make that much more content brainless afk button pushing.  Asking
for 100% effective taunts would be similar to asking for the removal
of spell resists.

Aggro management is a significant portion of the game, and 100%
effective taunt would negate it.
