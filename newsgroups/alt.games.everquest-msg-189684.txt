"We have decided that the Taunt skill is overpowered..."

Odd that of the "holy trinity" that everyone makes a fuss about, two are
basically hopeless at soloing.

Actually if you look at the trinity:
- Warriors have been effectively nerfed because they don't have a
  reliable way of grabbing aggro. Plus they're hopeless soloers.
- Clerics, while still top healers in the game, no longer have a monopoly
  on CHeal-level healing for exp groups. Plus they're hopeless soloers.
- Chanters... well, charm *is* currently overpowered, and needs *some*
  level of risk to offset the huge rewards. Even post-nerf I doubt that
  they could be classified as hopeless soloers.

On the other hand, having a class be good at soloing is not necessarily
reason to swing the nerf bat. What they really need to do is swing the
*unnerf* bat a few times to balance out the solo capabilities of other
classes. Let's face it, finding a group is not always easy, by any means.
Perhaps soloing shouldn't be encouraged, but it should be *possible*.

        ...Ronny
