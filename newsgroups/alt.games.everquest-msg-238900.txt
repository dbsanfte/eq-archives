    That is the perfect state to be in when you first log in.

    Less per hour than any other form of entertainment

    One.

> how much time do you need to enjoy the game?

    At least two hours a week, and if you only have two hours a week,
preferably two hours in one session.

> what kind of system do i need?

    256meg of ram and a decent video card - 5200FX or better will do.

    They've spent years balancing them - go with whatever you feel drawn to.

> can you buy the basic everquest and be content?

    Should get you through the first 30 levels, at which point you will
either like the game enough to buy more or have quit.

> really, just anything at all that comes to mind

    I've played hundreds of computer games, and EQ is the first to keep me
playing after 18 months. Nothing else has come close to that.
