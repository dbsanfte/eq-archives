Reading some other threads, I'm tempted to start a rogue in order to be 
what rogues -are- (or at least can be, I know its possible to play 
rogues that are honorable scouts and so on), which is to say sneaky 
theiving bastards.

Pickpocket skill allows me to actually steal money from mobs without 
having to go to all the bother of fighting them.  In fact, I can think 
of very little use of the skill other than this, as currently implemented.

Is it level capped?  That is to say, is there any reason I'd need to get 
my level higher to improve pickpocket skill?

Clearly the level cap would prevent me going to say the Planes to 
practice the art, but other than that, what would be the issues of a low 
level rogue stealing from high level mobs?  Is it any more likely to 
fail based on relative level?

I'd have no interest in doing this on a "blue" server, of course, since 
being an ass when there's no chance anyone can retaliate isn't 
honorable.  On a red server, though, can I pickpocket PCs as well as 
mobs?  Also, on red servers, is this considered a violation of game 
rules, or is it as I assume fair game since there -is- something you can 
do about it?

OK, I'm really not likely to do this at all, but its interesting to 
think about.  Really I'd love to see the skill either altered so as to 
make additional loot show up where it never was (say each mob can be 
PP'd successfully once, and has a reward on it which won't show up when 
killed whether the pocket has been emptied or not) or eliminated 
entirely, because most people don't play their rogues as jerks who would 
steal from their party members or from passerby's... but the fact that 
they -can- do so means they get cut out of many groups in the mid range 
for fear they -will- do so.

Another thought would be simply to have the game announce whats been 
pickpocketed as it does now whenever someone loots a body... and while 
you are at it, also have it announce how much cash came off the body 
each time to all.
