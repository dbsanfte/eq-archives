My lowbie halfling pally uses stormreaper steelwoven :-) (probably the
only pieces currently in use on test) but you do have to worship
karana and I assume you worship mithaniel marr. It is better, though -
its still cultural so ac, hp, mana the same but stormreaper has sta
and wis rather than luminant's str and wis. Engraved Royal Velium is
significantly inferior to both.
