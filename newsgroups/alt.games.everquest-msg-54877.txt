Hello, i would like to know how is the life on a PvP server.  With the new
change on sullon zek, i am very interested to start a character on.  But i
fear powergamer and kiddies who find funny to kill someone just for the kill
thrill.  True that maybe it`s not the case on sullon because of the team
rules.  Also how you find the TLC implented on sullon server ?  Well i want
to get some post about how did you like your experience on PvP server.
