This and the other posts here made me think of something, especially
with the new UI:

There is one reason why I don't spend another $12.95 per month for
another EQ account (though I have a free up to velious account key
from verant) That reason is I don't have a second computer and
probably could not run eq in two windowed instances well even with
EQ windows (if it worked. ) 

Since verant does not want you to run windowed.. It would seem 
to their benefit to make it so you could run another account/character
as a sub GUI of that main one. It would probably only require one new
gui window like switch to other character. The reason why I thought of
this was that I was thking of how in my old mud I could have two log
ins at the same telnet window and one of my characters follow the
other around then my main one have the other do stuff like cast spells
via key aliases. It would seem like if that was possible for me to do
in a NON graphical text mud, it would be even easier with a GUI to
facilitate it. You'd also not actually be running TWO graphical
instances of EQ at the same time.

I'm surprised verant has not thought of this, they'd essentially
nearly double their subscription money while not really having anymore
overhead.
