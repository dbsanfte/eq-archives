    Sell fully charged item to vendor. Sell uncharged item to vendor. Vendor
now has two fully charged items in stock - buy both back. Verant is
apparently aware that this works, and considers the cost of the buyback (and
possible loss of the item to other shoppers in the case of swapping chars
for Lore items) sufficient penalty. I also believe they cannot change the
game to differentiate between different levels of charges without making
each level of charges be a different item in the database, so their hands
are somewhat tied. 8) That Coldain Beard you were going to test with would
set you back a fair amount of cash - I'm glad my charged item that I get
recharged on a regular basis only costs 1 pp to buy back from the vendor....

    While on the subject of tricks in game: someone told me that he'd read
that multiquesting Velious armour was being done away with on Test. Has
ANYONE heard anything about that? Without a cite I'm leaning towards
"disbelieve", but I wouldn't put it past them.
