A pet can only hold aggro if all other players on the hate list are outside
of melee range.   If anyone is in melee range, the mob will ignore the pet
to attack the player instead.

It's an old fix from a few years ago, intended to close off a specific
raiding strategy.  A few guilds realized that the Avatar of War was much
easier to beat if he was being tanked by a charmed pet, a 20k hp giant,
instead of a 6.5k hp player warrior.  The charmed pet would hold aggro on
the AoW, while 20 or 30 melees beat on his rear side.
