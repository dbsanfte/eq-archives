Type /log on, and post the results here.  You do have a great weapon now
(ratio and proc) but even so, Im pretty sure your WAY behind any melee class
in terms of damage output.

In your 40's.. well I don't know the weapon you used, but you said you paid
100?pp for it.. so it must have been pretty basic, and low ratio.. and well,
I just don't buy it.  Its not a case of clerics not being damage dealers,
clerics aren't even melees period.. they just can't compete

That haste is all good and well, but if your skill cap is low, and your ATK
is really low, you don't get melee bonuses (duel wield, double attack,
tripple attack etc).. then that haste is just wasted really

hehe, i think your onto something there :)   I only group when I go to CT
now (not counting getting together with my friends, or using my bots) and
thats not often.. but assuming its a guild enchanter (only people I group
with nowadays anyway) they will cast (unprompted) vog on all meleers,
Shissar on themselves and other casters.

Disagree heh.  If i get chance ill add more (got a lot of replies to do this
morning!)

Clerics also have a lot of reason to forget AC, and go for something that
contains a lot of mana or wis.  (Or more acurately, forget a +hp BP)

Even with your extra buff I'd be amazed if you had better "tank" stats than
the ranger (lets forget the possibility that your an uber cleric, and hes a
guildless junk geared ranger)

The ranger tanking gives you the ability to med, to
a) heal more
b) less/no downtime
c) nuke and do some real damage
d) misc stuff like MoK and MoR

Well I dunno about wipe the raid...   if your on the cheal rotation your too
busy to cast "novelty" spells anway.. and a good rotation will plan ahead
for the likelyhood of a cleric death

If your not on the rotation tho, its gonna make zero difference if you live
or die.. if you get agro and are summoned, as soon as you die the MA is
getting agro back anyway.

I *hate* MoK in exp groups.  It lies about your HP and often makes cheal way
less effective.  If im tanking and the mob gets MoK'd when im at 2 bubbles
hp, I will soon be at 4 bubs before instantly dropping down to 1, upto 3.5
bubbs, down to half a bub and so on.    The cleric either thinks I have a
lot more HP than i actually do, or cast the cheal way early, because of the
MoK effect screwing with my hp bar

I do use MoR tho, when i remember/can be bothered to cast it anyway
