I haven't actually seen this in a long time, but I can recall seeing
the occasional double proc from a SSoY somebody else was using.  I
have not ever seen it from my SotM, nor have I seen it occur with
Instrument of Nife (which did proc on a Bash for me once).  Many
things are possible:  procs may work differently now than they used to
(it has been at least 18 months since I last noticed a double proc),
or procs may not all be resolved in the same way.  There're more than
a few EQ mechanics that don't seem likely or logical until you know
about how they interact with other mechanics and/or how a more logical
approach might be open to "exploitation".

Your unspoken assumption here is:  the proc chance on a given swing is
unaffected by haste.
[If the likelyhood of a proc on a given swing is affected by haste (and
there are certainly a number of equally, if not more, bizarre mechanics
in EQ), then you could still proc on any given swing without any change
in the average number of procs over time.]

Dammit Bergh, you're worse than I am about "thinking out loud".  I'm
gonna leave my last comment in anyway.  :-p

Heh, I can just imagine how astonishingly buggy it would be if they
tried to tie the proc timing for two weapons together (ignoring the
case of "buff" procs, where it would be easy):
Warrior01:  Man these weapons suck, I haven't had a proc all day.
<meanwhile>
RangerCorpse01:  I WAS using jolt, can I help it if my swords
proc'd 17 times in a row :(
