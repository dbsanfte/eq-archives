 Against something like Avatar of War, sure. Monks aren't tanks. However
in your average everyday XP grind a monk can 'tank' just fine.
Especially if you have a Shaman or Enchanter who can slow. I'd go with
Shaman though since Monks can't taunt (aggro != taunt) so the extra
healing would come in handy.
