You know it wouldn't be quite so bad that they don't let you alt-tab, IF
they did the professional thing and made it so you CAN'T alt-tab.  A good
programmer would have plugged those holes a while ago.  They should disable
the windows key, alt-tab, and any special keys that might pull you from
their program back into windows, especially since more often than not it
crashes windows.   There's absolutely no reason those things should be still
possible to activate.
