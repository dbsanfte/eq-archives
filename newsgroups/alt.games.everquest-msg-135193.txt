No I don't think you realise what I meant.... in a lot of our raids, we need
a LOT of mod rods pre-summoned before the mob even arrives.

And these mod rods need to continue throughout the course of the fight.. if
the mage has no mana to start pumping out rods, then the mob doesnt get
pulled.. simple as that.

Sure the cleric can help the mage build his mana in the first place, but the
raid is on hold until the magician does have sufficient mana to get rods in
production

Yeah I was only refering to modrod 2.. the kind of raids we do though, are
entirely dependent upon a magician being there.. so if there isnt a 56 mage
online, well most raids wouldnt even get planned

Thats not what I was saying.  You said, "a raid only waits till a cleric has
mana".. and i called you on that.  of course a shaman cannis and a mage
modrods to build mana up, but if they don't have mana, our raids ARE delayed
until they do.

> Well, shaman and mages, actually.  Thus my point here.

Well talking about mana regen rates, I don't think you can rank a magician
highly at all.  Think of it in terms of solo play mana-regen.. the magician
can't modrod, cuz a) 3 tokes on the rod will prolly kill him dead   b) he
has no way for that HP to regen even remotely fast

Well it depends I guess.. for 99% of our raids it doesnt matter WHO is oom,
it makes zero difference

An oom cleric? Oh well.. an oom wizard or shaman? big deal (think clearing
kael for Vindi/Statue, Tormax, clearing Umbral for RC, fighting in the deep
all the way to THO, PoG/PoF to get to Tunare/cazic)

When it comes to the end mob tho, well you make sure everybody is buffed and
FM before engaging.

Wizards also get mana regen from their epic, and from their familiars.
