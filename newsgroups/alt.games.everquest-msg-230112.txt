At either 61 or 62, if it cons lt blue or lower, you can DC it.  I am 
assuming your are more interested in finding one that is exactly 46 from 
your question though.  In that case, you'd want to have a person one level 
lower than you con it as well, if he sees dark blue, and you see lt blue, 
that's the one you want.  There is no way in game aside from conning to 
determine a mob's level, and, without multiple people conning, or the mob 
conning white, no way to determine an exact level.
