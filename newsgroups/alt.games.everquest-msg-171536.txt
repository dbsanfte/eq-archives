The flaw with pet classes for a person with short term play times is that pets are non
persistant over a log out.

This means every play session begins with summoning and buffing a pet, then sitting on your
can for a while getting mana back up to go.

Not a problem when you are on for 3 hours, whats 5 minutes at the beginning of your session?
On for an hour, though, now its 1/12 your time.  On for half an hour, 1/6th your time.

If you are looking for a soloing class with little to no downtime, you might look into a
bard... although there's nothing else to reccomend the class, of course, so there's no reason
anyone should consider nerfing it.
