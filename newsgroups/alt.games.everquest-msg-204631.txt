They're random, and the RNG is streaky, deal with it.  :-p

As an example, a few months back I took a solo Druid from 34 to 37
almost exclusively on HGs in RM.  From 34 to 35 he made less than
1kpp.  From 35 to 36 he made over 3.5kpp total.  From 36 to 37 he
made 2.5kpp.  A couple weeks ago some guildies of mine on Stromm
reported 6 straight kills with over 40 platinum per HG, an avg. of
over 50pp total loot per kill including the other coin and vendor
loots.  I've had a streak of 11 with no more than 3pp (platinum
coins that is, total loot from the 11 was about 98pp).

It's random, if you can't stand to not get 3 7's every time you
pull the lever, don't play the slots.
