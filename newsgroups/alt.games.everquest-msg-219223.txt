Actually the rogue can tank better.   He just wouldn't want to, since he
would be sacraficing too much damage.

If a ranger can't hold aggro off a rogue, he's doing something horribly
wrong.

No, Rogues do not get taunt.

Evade is powerful enough that I can make shaman tanking work.  My favorite
trick, although it can be hard to manage, is to have the shaman get aggro,
then backstab and attack until I get aggro back.   Tank until backstab
refreshes, evade (mob switches to shaman) backstab (mob switches back to me)
tank until backstab refreshes, wash, rinse, repeat...
