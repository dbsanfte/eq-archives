Oh come on, if I had a brother or sister who was a cleric (or any class
actually) I'd love for them to marry a ranger! Would never have to look far
for someone to rez! =p
(Yes I am the first person to shout ranger down when I die..rumor has it
rangers going down isn't always a bad thing ;) )

Vailene-newbie ranger on Lanys
Formally and hopefully someday I get to play them again:
Keipyur Mitzov 53 cleric- Torvo
Occulis Pravus 42 shaman-Torvo
Vaelrea Sadzaputz 35 dr00d- Torvo
Culys 26 Monk who can't fd split =/ -Torvo
