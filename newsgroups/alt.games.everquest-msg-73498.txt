It's not all that complicated, don't worry. :)  Just remember that Verant is
a business and if you want two accounts you're going to have to PAY for two
accounts.

Buy another copy of EQ
Open another account.  Make sure that ALL the billing (same name, credit
card number, etc) and ACCOUNT (same name, address, etc) information is
EXACTLY like it is for the first account.

Personally, I used the same account name but added a "2" at the end so that
it doesn't take much typing at all to log on to either account.

Once the character transfer service is back online you're good to go.  Keep
in mind that if you have Luclin installed on one computer it'll have to be
installed on the other, even if only one account has Luclin enabled.  This
isn't a big deal, just use your first account's CD and install it from that.

Errr, I'm assuming that you have more than one computer.  If not I don't see
much point in buying 2 accounts. :)
