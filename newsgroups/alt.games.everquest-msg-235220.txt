Eeep!  (Dives for cover)

Hehehe!

Sorry I forgot to hold up the "sarcasm card". <Grin>

Companies have been doing that for a while in the UK shifting the 
graveyard / holiday shifts to India to cut costs.

But it has lead to some really superb howlers in especially Tech Support 
issues being report in the press.

As well as a few worrying financial boo-boo's for the Insurance  and 
Finance companies.

The main problem being local accents and grammar versus English as 
second language.

But I still think that the fridge companies knowledge base might be 
better than Sony's when it comes to EQ.

I must have thought someone in Sony would have noticed that bookworms 
were a bit trivial as tributes went <evil grin>
