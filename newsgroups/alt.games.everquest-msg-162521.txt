I think you should play what makes you happy. I went from a dwarf cleric to
a dark elf necro, and have never regretted it.

The biggest twinks I gave the necro was a full set of Shadowbond (sol ro
quested) and a flesh harvester. And JBoots, but I can see where that would
be hard to solo as a cleric- my warrior buddy helped my cleric get the necro
(and his wiz) the booties. They made a HUGE difference in our lives.

HP and mana gear is awesome for the starting necro. So is a moonstone ring
or anything else with extended range.

Hope this helps,
