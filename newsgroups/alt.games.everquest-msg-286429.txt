On a raid today (which I'm currently crashed out of for some reason), we 
had an event where many adds, some invisible, were going to pop. 
Offtanking was required for this, and the raid leader suggested that we 
needed to use F8 to find the mobs, aggro and OT them.

Let me say this: f8 is NOT your friend.

f8 targets the nearest mob to you. Hit f8 again, and you get the same 
mob again, unless something moved or died.

Its a poor solution to the offtanking problem, because the other OT's 
are doing the same thing, and in many circumstances, getting the same 
mob as you are. Meanwhile, mobs further away from the action are 
wreaking havoc on our soft underbelly of healers, CC, nukers, maybe even 
melee DPS.

Its possible to overcome this to some extent by spreading out the OT's, 
getting them in positions where each will be the closest to some mobs 
and not to others. And you can try and overcome it by running around 
like mad, spamming f8 and looking for something that isn't being handled.

BUT there's a better, simpler solution, that only takes a minute to set up.

EQ has a "cycle thru nearest NPC" button. This button lets you target 
the nearest NPC, like f8, but if you hit it again, you'll get the next 
nearest, and the next and the next, till you're all the way thru all the 
NPC's nearest you. Then the next time you hit it, you're back to 
targeting the "f8" mob, and around the cycle again.

What button is this, you ask? Well, although the capability exists, for 
some crazy reason EQ doesn't assign it to a button by default. You have 
to set it up for yourself.

Simple to do: Hit the EQ button, Options, Keys, Target, and down on that 
list is Cycle Nearest NPC. Click on the spot under the column where 
other targeting options like f8 are listed and then push any button you 
like on your keyboard. This will assign the cycle function to that key. 
I'm personally using the - key for this, as its right next to the = key, 
which I remapped my autoattack button to. But pick anything you like as 
long as you'll be able to remember it.

f8 will still work just like it always did. But use your new key 
instead, get used to it, and I think you'll learn to love it... and hate f8.
