On The Nameless, 15-25pp each (not stack!) seems to be the norm.  Trade skills are just
so popular that you can charge these amazingly high prices and people will stay pay.  Spider silks
going for 5pp each before the bizaar would have seemed ridiculous, but now it's commonplace.
I can even sell spiderling silks for 3-4pp each no problem - maybe more but haven't tried it.
