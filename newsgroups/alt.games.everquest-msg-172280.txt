When ever you over clock / over volt you run a risk.  Now that doesn't mean
that it is going to fry tomarrow, and it doesn't mean it wont.   If you have
raised the volts that high and are still crashing it has to be the temp's
Something is getting to hot, and adding more juice is just going to get it
hotter.  Look at your fan's and make sure they ae running.  Not all blowing
in , or all blowing out of the case.  I got one from I high end gaming
manufactuer and it had 4 120 blowing in and the only exohst was the power
suply and the tiny holes along the edge of the expansion rail's.   I noticed
the problem and sent them an email.  they offered to fix it if I payed 2 way
shipping. (8 screws  flip 2 fans 8 screws  $87    Not)

Look at what else it might bee before adding more heat.  All the best
equipment in the world doesn't alway's play together nicely. (ie.   atholon
xp and soundblaster.) do a search on the net listing 2-3 components at a
time.   You might find a site that discusses a specific cure.

Good luck.
