Dang. I do that all the time.  Never could get those two cities straight.
=)

I also have trouble differentiating between Timorous Deep and the Ocean of
Tears.

Hehehe, thanks Kaev.  I was deliberately skimpy on details regarding Gukta
because I only poked around there for half an hour one day, so I'm not
*that* familiar with it.  (I was sorely tempted to try and kill the basher
prisoner, but was afraid the whole zone would aggro me and didn't feel like
going on a CR - some of the guards were blue to me.)  So I didn't leave much
to pick at.

One thing I love about WTF, though, is its faithful represntation of the
old-world zones.  I hope to do the same, and provide details that people
know and can identify with.

Thanks for the feedback, Kaev.  And thanks, too, to everyone who posted
encouragment; I appreciate it all.
