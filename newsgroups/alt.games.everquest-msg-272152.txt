   I kinda got the drift that SOE is going to be charging for "Large Patch"
sized updates as well as for regular expansion packs (possibly.  I would
think probably.)  Anyways, here is the link:

   I gotta wonder about this strategy.  I know that I would resent having
to pay for a large patch every month or so. Ok, no one technically has to
buy it, but I know that when I played EQL I didn't like the idea of "being
cut of" content by not purchasing it.  I could easily be wrong, but I would
guess that the majority of people who do like EQII will buy the new content
as it becomes available.

   I know that CoH has had 3 large updates for free so far.  New zones, new
story lines, new features, everything that seems involved with this concept
SOE is trying to sell. I don't know about WoW.  Anyone know if they are
planning on releasing any updates yet, or if they will charge for them? 

   I've long had the sense that SOE is more interested in wringing out
every penny from its player base than in providing a decent gaming
experience for the money spent.  I want the people who make my MMOs to make
a profit. I want them to drive nice cars.  I want them to be able to tell
their stockholders that things are looking rosy and they shouldn't pull the
plug on the games I like to playing. But it is possible to take this too
far, and I think SOE is doing a bang up job at that.

   I dunno. I could be over reacting.  Maybe the players of EQII will take
this as a good thing. But if none of EQII's closest competitors are doing
this, (and again, I don't know if WoW is or not) I gotta wonder if this
will do more harm to EQII's overall financial health than to help it.
