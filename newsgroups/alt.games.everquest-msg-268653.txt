After 5 years I have quit a few times for the ALL of the same reasons as you 
mention, plus my RL is too busy to log on for more than 1-2 hours LFG for 
almost all of it.  This time I quit forever (gave away all gear).  I have 
been giving WoW a try, and so far #1 is no issue on 2 year old system 
1024x768 all graphics turned up, #3 is not an issue SO FAR (lvl 18 Druid), 
#4 quests give good XP and loot.  I think #2 will happen in all games.  WoW 
actually forces you to do some quests to get "abilities" every now and then, 
so that puts you in a story world for a few minutes.
