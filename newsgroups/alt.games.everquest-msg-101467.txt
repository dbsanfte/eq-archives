We of the Troll Anti-Defamation League (TADL) have long pondered the
lack of Trolls in Annie M. Benson-Lennaman's (AMBL) signature file. It
is with growing concern that we see players of the game called
Everquest passing trolls by and choosing to play other races. We
understand that AMBL may not feel the need to play a troll, since she
is married to the exemplary troll Lenny (Hi, Lenny!), but we feel that
this in no way exempts her from doing so herself. As a consequence, we
have taken it upon ourselves to suggest to AMBL that she promptly start
a Troll character, for example a beastlord, which is a class missing
from her .sig, and name it (for example) Teacroc. (The reason being,
Trollish Beastlords get crocodile warders.)

Furthermore, it is with great anxiety we note that Teacure seems to be
stuck at level 9, and plus also that AMBL seems to be hunting in
outdoor zones. Might we suggest that Tealeef drag Lenny into a level-
appropriate dungeon (For example Solusek's Eye or Infected Paw), to
experience the heightened excitement and fun (and experience) dungeon
crawling might bring? Or, if Teacure feels up for some soloing, she
could head into the conveniently-located and conveniently-filled-with-
undeads Befallen? This should not be taken the wrong way, however; if
AMBL has already tried dungeon adventures and found them lacking, or
suffers from claustrophobia, she is of course allowed not to go there.

As a final note, meeting these demands might interfere with such petty
concerns as 'paying the bills' and 'putting food on the table', but
when you get right down to it, what's more important, playing a game,
or having a place to live?
