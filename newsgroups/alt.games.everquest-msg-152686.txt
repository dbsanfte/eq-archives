    Sounds like they're going to nerf the XP all to hell to prevent the
"everyone in this dungeon join a raid for extra XP" thing from happening.
Which would stink. I'd be happy if total XP was computed for the group that
gets the kill, then this XP was split evenly amongst the members of the
raid. After getting a few kills (maybe four?) in VT and gaining two blues of
AA XP, I'm sure there'd be more than enough XP to go around if it was done
like this without there being any incentive to join zonewide raids just to
do XP.
