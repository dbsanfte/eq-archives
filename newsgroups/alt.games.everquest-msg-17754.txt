Najena *used to be* a wonderful place for your level. Parts of it still
can be, I suppose, but that was before they put the GB quest skellies in
there. If you go there, you should find out immediately if some higher
levels are camping the skels on the top floor. If so, then you'll
probably find lots to keep you busy and earn xp. Loot can be fair for
lvl 15 I guess. However, if you come around the corner into the very
first room and you get nailed by "a skeleton" that looks just like the
ones you are used to killing, but is suddenly bright red and hitting you
for 50 or better, run away. I was getting solid xp off of them at lvl
35. I think they are lvl 27 or so, and if you're a 15th level Necro,
they will take your lunch money and make you cry.
  If he's not there, then there are plenty of larger and greater
skellies for you to hunt, along with ogre guards and elements.  Mind the
tentacle terrors. They're casters and can stun your ass across the room.
