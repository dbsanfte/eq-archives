I would think most folk would find it better than the authorities I have
found that DO say Charisma has an slight bearing on faction gain/loss, such
as Prima's guide book, and a few web sites like:
http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/new/class/rogue.shtml
http://elvar.net/attribute/
http://eq.stratics.com/content/details/attr_ref.shtml
BTW, Prima's online errata to their book does not change their statement on
charisma influencing faction gain/loss.
http://www.primagames.com

NOTE:  None of these sites proves (or even gives satisfactory evidence) that
charisma influences faction gain/loss...they merely state that it does.  Not
proof.  Not evidence.  The only thing they prove is that this
information/misinformation has been out there for quite some time, and that
it came from somewhere.  I have yet to find the original source from long
ago where I got the idea that Charisma does have a minor effect on faction.

So far, I have not seen hide nor hair of any evidence being presented to the
contrary.  Just the simple confident assertion that it doesn't.
