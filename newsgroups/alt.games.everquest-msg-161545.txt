I've used it for almost 2 years, dual-booted with win98 though for some
older titles.  It was miserable when it first came out, but with each
service pack it got quite a bit better.  In my opinion it's much more stable
than Win98, yet a tad slower.  Nothing very noticeable though.

I just upgraded from P3 700 to AMD 2100+ and it seems quite a bit faster.
I'm using GeForce GTS 64MB DDR card though.  I don't think that should
account for long load times though.  What do you mean it runs 2 chars better
than other one runs 1?  I didn't think you could run EQ with other proggys
unless having EQWin or somesuch program?  Pressing alt/tab always caused the
game to not launch again on my systems.

Best of luck.  It's too bad you almost have to be a
programming/network/hardware professional to run this game at user end
lately.  ACK!
