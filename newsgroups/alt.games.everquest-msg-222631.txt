    The caster can make it really bad because push direction is the same as
direction they're facing when the spell goes off. So if they turn to make
sure they're not moving when they cast, or turn to look around, etc. the
push can be the exact opposite of what you expect. Don't even get me started
on the zerg pet AA's.

    They want to maximize DPS, and being behind the mob means going OOR a
lot because of the push and having to push past all the other people behind
the mob. When I play my dwarf rogue, it can be near-impossible to maintain
melee range if there's a couple of stupid medium-sized or larger races back
there with me. Attack from the side rear and you still get the advantages of
rear positioning without having to deal with other people.

    They'll need to move more than that if there's a goodly number of melees
back there, bashing and kicking away. Want to see a terrific example of what
pet push can do when an entire raid uses their zerg pet AA's all at once?
