This spell rocked when our druids and mages used them to kill the FD mobs in
the pit for rztw in tactics.  I think our druids and mages used them as well
in the Justice trials.  It's been ages since I have done them, so I forgot -
sorry.

For tradeskilling.   A lot of the planar armor requires some form of Imbued
Diamond - earth, fire, water, justice, etc.

Good luck on getting the spells - they aren't fun to obtain at times.  But
it's a lot easier now than it was before.
