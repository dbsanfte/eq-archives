At 59 there is a "pet discipline" AAxp ability, short of that there is a
very good reasons chanters go looking for "q" key every time a group member
decides to summon a pet. There are some methods you can use to minimise the
anarchy (the back off/attack combo you mentioned) but they have a mind of
their own when your getting hit or they are taking more damage from another
mob.

Consider that particular duo to be made in hell ; )

Too make matters worse I only solo - so have no experience working with any
group member let alone the dreaded short fused chanter, so am proberly one
of the worst people to ask.

All pet's are pretty lazy - and if there are 2 mobs standing on top of each
other and the one it's chewing on flees, it will just change targets rather
than chase it's original one down.

You seem to be doing everything right from your postings,  just remember you
can influence your pet effectively, but never control it till level 59. You
have to be more careful with the pulling because once mobs are aggroed you
have a harder time with crowd control with pet's in the equation.
