"Social Rules" and PNP can live together. The "Social Rules" can be
upheld through their traditional method of Social Sanctions as others
have mentioned. However the OP went overboard and broke both the PNP
and "Social Rules" by doing what he did. (Because last time I checked
KSing was still against these unwritten "Social Rules".)

Fact is that the OP acted like an ass when he got a little hot under
the collar. What the noobs did was wrong on a social level, but I'm
gonna' have to give them the benefit of the doubt. The OP KSing and
generally being an ass to people less than half his level was just
juvenile.
