The epic pet is amazing.  One time a Chardok exp group
dwindled down in the wee hours to just me (56 Paladin)
and a Magician with his epic pet.

After trying *many* different strategies, we finally
determined that the way for us to get the most
kills with the least downtime was for me to stand
back, not engage the mob, and just chain-cast my
Deepwater Bracer to keep the mob stunned as much
as possible (ghetto Slow spell) while the epic pet
did all the tanking.

Oh, the shame...
