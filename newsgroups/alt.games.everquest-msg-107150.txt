I think in theory chanter charms are meant to last longer. My experience is
that chanter charms dont last as long, even using allure (lvl 49). Average
time for allure to work for me (213 charisma) is about 10 seconds on level
40ish mobs. Id like to believe that ive just been unlucky and the spell is
really better than that.

For soloing, forget charm. I use my level 49 animation with SLTW, and it
just tears dark blues to pieces, even without fear. I can solo faster than a
necro, and faster than a non-quadding druid. Only problem is the pet eats up
the xp, so the xp isnt all that great. Toss in a ranger (melee+snare for
fear kiting) and the xp is as fast as it gets in dungeons. I got through a
yellow AA in a bit over an hour. (yeah yeah, i guess some of you uber people
can make more than that in uber groups, save the flames)
