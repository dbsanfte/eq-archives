WIS jewelry:

+3 earrings (gold jasper), less than 50 for the pair
+6 rings (plat jasper), less than 400 for the pair
+7 face (also STR) (plat ruby), less than 500

Those are the basics you should be aiming for.  I wouldn't save up for
anything else that you can get for yourself.  I think the BS tunic drops in
Unrest...kinda tough at your level but head on over in your late 20s and
hope that no one's farming it.

Platinum armband, Solusek's Eye (SolA), +3 WIS.  Retail around 200, but the
critter who drops it isn't that hard (Efreeti) with an upper 20s group.

Charred Guardian Shield 9 WIS (SolA) off a Clockwork EXG.  This one is
either 100% magic resistant or danged near it.  This would take a low-30s
group with, obviously, melee folks.

Molten Cloak, 4 WIS, SolA, off Gabby.  She's a caster and a gnome, but if
you have good gnome faction and you're high enough level (eh, upper 30s I
think) you shouldn't aggro the clockworks standing with her.

Kobold King in Nagafen's Lair (SolB), Runed Mithril Bracers, +5 WIS.
Requires full mid-30s group at least.

That's all I can think of at the moment.  I earned all of this stuff myself
'cause I'm perpetually broke too.
