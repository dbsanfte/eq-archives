because it doesnt work cleanly.  If we make solo a degenerate group
(which i agree makes sense), then we have this scenario.  Lvl 49 Nec
with a lvl 40 pet.  Pet does 51% damage in some case.  If it acts as a
group,
by the group splt rules, the pet should receive 45% of the exp
(40+5)/(40+5+49+5).  and the nec should get 55% of the exp.  And who
knows, this may be the case, i've not done tests where the pet level was
sufficiently lower than the owner that you could really tell the diff
between
5% exp.  And unfortunalty, with the current situation that is exp reporting,
well probably never know.
