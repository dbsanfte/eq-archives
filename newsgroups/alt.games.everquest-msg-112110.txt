I have just gone from Win2k to WinME, mostly for the sake of Everquest. 
I have a Athlon XP 1600 with an SB Live 5.1, and one of my flatmates has 
an Athlon 1200 with a SB Audigy. When using Windows 2000 my music would 
continually stuff up, so I turned it off. The sound was okay and I 
considered it to be fine. When my flatmate started playing Everquest the 
music wouldn't work at all either, and sound would only work if he 
turned the accelleration right down to nothing. It sounded very, and I 
mean VERY bad.

After reading about these problems with Win2k/WinXP on the Everquest 
forums we both moved back to WinME. Now the music plays perfectly on 
mine (I love it! It gives the game so much more atmosphere!) and its 
almost perfect on my flatmate's except for the occasional popping. The 
sound is just brilliant and I am kicking myself for not using WinME 
earlier. The environmental effects are lovely and are now something I 
would not play without!

Its definately an issue with Everquest and Win2k/WinXP. If you can do 
without Win2k/WinXP's greater stability for less resource hogging and 
better audio I highly recommend using Win98/ME instead.
