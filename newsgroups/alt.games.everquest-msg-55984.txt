First off, I want to say that this is one of the more exciting patches
I've seen since I've been playing. VI is actually *listening*, it seems.
And yes, you can jump in and attribute it to "fear of new competition"
or whatever the hell you want. Who cares? Some fast moving and positive
changes in the game.

> ** Project M Implemented  **

That moved fast! Wow! In reality, this is not much more than a bit of
"fluff" in the game, along the line of adding /Gems, but its' fun! I
plan on trying it. A nice break from the normal routine, and people on
various discussion boards have had this on their wish list for ages.
Nothing to change the balance of the game to speak of, but just fun.
Good for VI for putting this in.

Not having played there, I guess I don't understand it. If things on
that server are that tough, then I guess it was needed. *shrug*.

I think I can see the reason for this, (avoiding some mass zone-ins
straight to the arena, etc.) and doesn't seem to hurt much. I bind at
the zone anyway.

All comments from the "win one for the pharmers" crowd aside, this is an
excellent example of VI *listening*. You all said you wanted them to do
more polls, get more feedback, respond to the wishes/needs of the player
community. Here's the case in point. They did a poll. The results were
beyond question. A tiny handful of people wanted the TLC. The rest
either wanted zero change to the current system, or felt a change was in
order, but thought TLC was *NOT* the way to do it. Now it's gone. Good
ridance.
 
> - Added a melee bind location to the dock in Iceclad.

HUGE improvement for the mid-level melee types. Your first trips to
Vellious can be horrifying. (But still fun!) But having to go even
further, all the way to Thurg, just to get bound when you weren't even
sure if you could take a snow cougar yet, well... it seemed a bit much.
I think this will make the early ventures to Vellious a bit more
accessible for the melee types just hitting the 30 mark. I know when I
was first there I didnt' even bother trying to make it to thurg to bind.
I was bound in W. FP and if I died, I just had to take the boat back to
IC until our cleric got the first rez spell to summon me there. Good job
on this one.
Will also allow some casters some extra "bind business" in IC. he he.

Nice. Not really a problem, but that's always been a minor annoyance to
me.

I never even noticed this.

This is *GREAT*!!!

Long overdue. Probably the most common scam/mistake in trading. Should
have been done long ago. Glad to see it.

Cool. Nice, and will make people appreciate healers even more, perhaps.
<g> Now if they could just make it so everyone in the group could see
exactly how much damage the casters do with their nukes....... (Weren't
they supposed to be working on that?)

Speaking as somebody who has a character with a master fishing skill,
that's good. Makes the skill *somewhat* more worthwhile.
