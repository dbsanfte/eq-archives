Ohhhhh... I would very much like to watch as you killed both of them! They
plagued Darklet, now they are plaguing Jannael as well... however, I did get
her out. Some kind hearted soul dragged her out of the water for me and she
recovered all her things. And she had a LOT of stuff a lvl 13 enchanter
should not have, due to the twinking of her ex boyfriend :) (at least he
didn't ask from them back!)

thank you, and shoot me a tell ingame if you please to, and if you're on the
Innoruuk server!
