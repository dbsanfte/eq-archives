Ok.. if you read it right you would see that I said that when I zoned after
the rezz.. into WW  it took me to verants "safe spot" for when you are low
on HP's. and as a matter of fact I wasn't even that low on HP's maybe 1 bub
down.  So being that I was very KOS there.. and wasn't sure if things saw
through invis.. I didn't want to chance it for 450pp. (and I didn't know
about necro's being able to summon corpses until later on.. this is my first
real char.. so still learning everything)

So.. I just got that cleric to re rezz that same corpse.. and I looted and
left the zone heehee...

anyone else gonna tell me what I did wrong? lol.this was simply a "this is
what happened to me... so be careful it doesn't happen to you" post and now
everyone wants to pick at it..
