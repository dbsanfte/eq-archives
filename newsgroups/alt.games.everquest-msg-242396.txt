the patch supposedly fixed this but just incase you ever experience it
again, heres how you fix it.

during each death loop, you have about 1 second to type. as quickly as you
can type /q and hit enter. this will force an (eventual) log out of your
char (up to 10 minutes) and when you log back in the loop will be over. I've
experienced this nasty bug 3 times now and /q got out of it each time.
