The Winter of the World series by Michael Scott Rohan is mostly about
a smith. He spends a *lot* of time smithing stuff and learning how
to smith well.

Naturally he does a lot of other things too. :-) But that's probably the
main example of tradeskiller-as-hero that I can think of in fantasy.

Good series by the way.
