I know what you mean.  If I can get a gate or port, so be it.  But it's not
too often I'll sit in a zone and whine about needing a port in /ooc.  I
almost feel they should have put in fewer wizzie spires and druid rings.
I'll never forget the first time I entered WK with a necro born in Qeynos
and asked in /ooc how far is the run to FP.
Someone tells you:  HAHAHAHA!!!!

ok, I got the point but wanted out of Qeynos to explore.  A nice higher
level bard offered to run me there.  I didn't know at that point anything
about bards, so that was cool.  She ran me there pretty fast.  It was almost
scary, just the effect I'm sure VI wants you feel.  She invised us through
HHP and I remember seeing all those red conned Orcs *shudder*......It was
daytime in the forest, so I had to learn about nighttime there the hard way
at a later date.
"STAY WITH ME!" she yelled to me as we made our way past an angry, aggroed,
and wandering Kizdean Gix.

Eventually she deposited me safely at the gates of Freeport.  It was a rush
to me since I had only been playing a *very* short time, and was blown away
at how HUGE this world was even though I had seen very little.

I'm glad I didn't get a port or gate there for my first trip.

Sean...
