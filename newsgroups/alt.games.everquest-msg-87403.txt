: Warrior, Shaman, Cleric and Bard.

Not bad. I'd swap the warrior with an SK though. The reason is the
SK has a few things that make it an advanatge in a 4 people
group. For one he can snare and FD pull.

: Shaman does all the groovy shit shaman can do.  He can be a tank,
: slow, haste and back-up healer.

More or less. My main is a shaman and we're very far from
a tank in higher levels :)

: Cleric heals and stuns with the might (snort) DD thrown in from time
: to time - unless you go after undead.

Cleric is never bad. He can rez you at high levels.

: Bard - fills in any gaps and backup damage dealer.  Snare, mana and
: heal songs, haste and AC, crowd control, etc.

Also not bad. I'd have said enchanter, but bard is good actually. He's
a second papertank and has some very decent songs.

These choices are for fun play up to 50 or so. The 50+ play and
raids look different :)
