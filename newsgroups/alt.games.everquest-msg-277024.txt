Obviously, but that was not my point. The market will decide in favour 
of the players with lots of money as against the players with little or 
no money. If rich people want to pay lots to play a certain way, then 
companies will quite rightly respond. Clearly the division is not that 
simple, and no doubt there will be a market for "purist" games where you 
cannot buy an advantage, if enough people are prepared to pay enough to 
play in them. But ultimately the market is driven by money, not votes or 
headcount.
