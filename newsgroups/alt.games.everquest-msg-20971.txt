The real money maker with bows is Trueshot. They sell easily at 200pp, and
cost only 12pp per success and 1pp per failure to make. The drawbacks are
that the main components are NO DROP, one of the components can only be
obtained in Kelethin and is LORE, and the Bow itself is LORE. So you have to
make one, sell it, make another, and forever be back in Kelethin. Even
harder if you want to USE a Trueshot as well!

Regarding success rates, with a skill of 100-150 I was successful about 1/6,
150-175 1/3, 175-200 2/3, and since 200 I have made 10 without failure.
Highest selling price was 750 (someone offered to pay that because they
needed to do Raincaller and I didn't actually want to sell the one I had at
the time), lowest was 75pp + a stack of Tumpy Tonics! But I usually sell at
200pp, occasionally dropping to 180pp on a negotiation.

The trivial for Trueshots is still unknown. The highest level Fletcher I
have heard of is 216, and neither Trueshots or the top-end Darkwoods are
trivial at that level.
