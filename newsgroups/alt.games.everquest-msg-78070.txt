If they "fix" Izera at the same time they "fix" the Soulbinders
(and I'm still not convinced this isn't "working as intended"),
there's going to be a lot of carnage in South Ro -- she's
level 55 and cons "scowling, ready to attack" to most people.

As long as she's passive, that's not a problem, but if they
make her act like any other NPC, she's going to lay waste
to most of the zone.  Remember how obnoxious Dorn and Gix
and the Dragoon were when you were newbies?  Imagine that
happening all the way up to level 60...
