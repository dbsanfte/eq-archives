Pasting in your gear list to comment...

> Primary: Arbitors Combine Greatsword

It's pretty expensive to get a decent upgrade to this, you might
consider a Savage Stone Axe [33/36 8sta 65hp] if you see a good
deal on one, I've seen the price drop sharply since PoP (its
got a recommended level, can't recall what it is tho).
For a one hander, you might still be able to find a cheap Mace
of the Fallen Crusader (21/25 and stats), it has a reccommended
level of 53, dunno if there's a minimum, and I've seen it as
cheap as 2kpp.


> Secondary: Skull Marked Shield

Nice shield.  The staid old Sarnak Battle Shield will give you
more AC, more HP (40 + STA boost), and 10MR/10FR/10CR.  I'm
pretty sure it's cheaper too.  And before you start worrying
about mana, I have found that the depth of Kaev's mana pool
almost never matters, solo or grouped.  Root and our various
Stuns are cheap, the effectiveness of the rest of our spells
is usually far more dependent on mana regen (i.e. can I afford
to cast something else occasionally) than on depth of mana pool
(i.e. can I afford to cast something else once).


> Ranged: Goranga Idol

Someday, when you've got 3k or so and nothing better to spend it
on, you might upgrade this to an Idol of the Thorned.


> Ear: Cougar Claw Earring
> Ear: Cougar Claw Earring

For the ears, I prefer Orc Fang to Cougar Claw these days, you give
up one AC for 15 HP, and I've found HP harder to come by than AC.
There are some 6 AC earrings around that go for under 1k, can't
recall the name, they'd be enough more AC to be better than the Orc
Fangs.


> Neck: Spider Fur Collar

Shop the bazaar, sometimes Dragon Tooth Choker is being sold cheap
(1200 or less).


> Face: Validus Custodus Plate Visor

Good face pieces are expensive, maybe watch for a good deal on
Crystal Spider Eyes, or save 4 or 5kpp up for Death Mask of the
Elysians.


> Head: Deepwater Helm

Helm of Raldukan is expensive (7 to 9k), and it's the cheapest upgrade
here I know of.

> Shoulder: Adamantite Epaulets

Crested Spaulders are 11 AC and 6 STA, forget the WIS (except for
tradeskilling, if you enjoy beating your head against that wall).
El cheapo resist gear:  Thunder Etched Pauldrons: 10 AC, 4 all resists.
Expensive resist:  Granite Imbued Spaulders:  20 AC, 10 all resists


> Finger: Platinum Fire Wedding Ring

The obvious upgrade here I won't mention.  You might consider doing
the Fine Antique Ring quest from Holly in the PoK museum.  You'd give
up a little AC and some HP for Mana Preservation 2 (and you could
just get the FAR to swap in when you're casting a lot, keep the
higher AC/HP ring equipped normally).  Mana Preservation has the
same effect as an 11% boost in your mana pool depth PLUS an 11%
boost in your mana regen rate (well, almost, you lose a little to
truncation).


> Finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring
> Wrist: Deepwater Bracer
> Wrist: Deepwater Bracer

A sufficiently large bankroll is the limit here.  You can wear most
of the high-end racial armors in their unimbued form, as well as
Blessed Full Mithril (gives a little extra WIS over the base), and
the racial bracers are nice:  25 AC, 30 HP, 30 mana, 5 all resists.
They're expensive tho.


> Arm: Deepwater Vambraces

I have not personally seen any better droppable arms except for the
high-end racial stuff (over 10k for arms).


> Chest: Engraved Royal Velium Field Plate

I suspect you'll be wearing this for a while...


> Back: Direwolf Fur Cloak

Cheap upgrade:  Cloak of the Icebear:  8 AC, 10 HP, 20 CR
Watch for a deal on:  White Bear Pelt Cloak:  11 AC, 75 HP, 5 STR,
5 WIS, 3 MR, 50 mana.  The 75 HP is hard to beat, and the other
stats aren't bad either.


> Feet: Shissar Scaled Boots

Deepwater Boots


> Legs: Black Ice Leggings

You might could replace with Acrylia Plate Greaves (1600 - 2kpp).
Other than the Acrylia decent legs start around 8k and go up.
I wore Greaves of Ro until I finally could afford Barbed Ringmail
(25 AC, 7 STA) at level 53.

> Waist: Smiter's Girdle

FBSS is cheap haste these days.  Zero AC, which sucks, but the
increase in your damage output is worth a lot.


> Hands: Deepwater Gauntlets
Watch for a deal on Thunder Etched Gauntlets, or get Silver Chitin

Handwraps instead of an FBSS.
