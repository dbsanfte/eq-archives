The main advantage of Torpor over iCH isn't the mana efficiency as
much as the fact that you don't need to run your hitpoints down as low
to use it. It's a 1200 or 1500pt heal (depending on how you catch the
ticks) w/o AA boosts, so you don't have to live as dangerously to get
full efficiency out of your heals. Doesn't matter much during downtime
but it helps a good bit during combat where you don't really want to
be down 2000hp then locked into a 10 second heal. 

A wicked bone Atlatl will drop cast time of torpor to under 5 seconds,
and quickbuff 2 on top of that will get it down to 3 (I think, not
there yet). Much easier to channel that than iCH. 

Rgds, Frank.
