Speaking of errant familiars, I was in Castle Mistmoore a few days ago. 
Going places I had missed at a lower level. Was upstairs in the Tower. 
There were no others in that part of the castle. Some guy who had been 
whining about everyone stealing his pulls on the way to the zone line 
sent me a tell. He wanted to know why my familiar was pulling from the 
area he was in. He was down by the pond near the zone and wanted to know 
if my "pet" was going to be KSing him as well. I tried to explain that 
familiars do not pull and he said "his" mobs were agroing on the familiar 
and I was a liar. And I should take it someplace it could kill things 
that were more it's level!!  This was a high 20's player... 28 or 29ish.  
Can you say E-Bayer...   As in I needed a Bayer Aspirin.
