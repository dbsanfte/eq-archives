Can anyone tell me what the deal is with XP now?

I have spent most of my time soloing and lately I have been mostly in
Scarlet Desert.

When I used to kill dark blue mobs, I would get usually 1% xp, sometimes
even 2%, and once in a while no increase. Now, I can kill 2 to 3 blue mobs
and only get a total of a 1% increase and sometimes even 0%!!

Does the evil empire (Sony), only want people to group now? Either in PoP or
LDoN? It seems that is the only way to get any good xp any more. It sucks
because most times, I do not have the time to spend and hour getting a group
together, then getting buffed, then finally going to fight. I just want to
log on, kill for maybe and hour, hour and a half and then log. But nooooooo,
thanks to Sony, I can't do this AND get any good xp!!

I just wish the xp in the game was equal all the way around, no matter what
the situation!

Thanks!
