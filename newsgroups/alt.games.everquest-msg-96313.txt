Actually, I was cheering the Giant to slap her dead...  A 30th level Shaman
trying to take on an Ice Giant...  If she were 35 to 38... I could almost
believe she had a chance, with her pet, and dots.  Unfortunately, being the
higher level player, with the more annoying dots...  The mob is more agro
on me than on her unless I rooted it.  Almost makes me wish I could root
her and show her the errors of her ways.
