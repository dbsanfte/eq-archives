Its a spell/proc to reduce agro on a mob (assuming its not resisted)

Wizards get something similar called concussion...  mob_01 suffers a blow to
the head (or something)

Basically everything you do to a mob adds to your "hate" count.. whoevers
highest is getting beat on.. things like taunt, snare, slow, enraging blow
(high end warrior procs) add a lot more "hate" than regular hits, heals and
debuffs.  Evade/FD/jolt either reduces your "hate count" or totally resets
it.. which is good when your trying to stay alive
