I run mine at 1280x1024, with all models on, all options turned on.

I now have:
PIII-800
768MB 133MHz ram
GF4 ti-4200 with 128MB of DDR

Used to do the same with a GF2 MX-400 with 64MB of ram, but did see lag in 
tree intensive zones, as well as the bazaar, and any crowded spot.  With 
the GF4, lag is significantly reduced, only run into it in the Bazaar and 
on raids.
