Web pages. Use any search engine to find out information. There is an
enormous amount of information out there.  I would have gone mad if I
didn't twig to this early on. There is absolutely no way I want to suck
everything for myself.

Most stuff just has to be practised, like weapon skills. And there are
guides for maxing all skills as easily as the game allows.

It really is a trade off. If they made it too easy, it wouldn't be worth
playing.
