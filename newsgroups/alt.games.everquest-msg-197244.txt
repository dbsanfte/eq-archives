It's also generally considered the easiest and therefore the one that 
people who are looking to get flagged go after.  Yes, the others are 
based around other requirements but they hardly receive the attention 
that the trial of execution does.

Congrats?  I hardly think you, your alts or any member of your guild 
struggled to make it through the trials.  The fact that you leveled your 
rogue to 65 with 9 days /played speaks loads about how far from the norm 
you are.

We're talking about people *struggling* to make it through trials here, 
which seems to be the vast majority of people.  I think we've established 
that uber gear on the part of the melees makes the jobs of the casters 
and pushing people through easier.

How exactly does slow increase the DPS of the group again?  And yes, 
banishment is a godsend when the spawn gods smile upon you.  But it's 
also resistable and not every druid looking to get flagged has the spell.  
Amazingly, there are actually people who want to be flagged pre-60!  And 
even people who don't have an army of plvling bots to get them to 60 in a 
week!

Just out of curiosity, how many people do you know that used a trial 
other than execution to receive their PoS/PoV flag?  And how many people 
do you know that are flagged for PoS/PoV?
