In case any of you are running into the same problem, I thought I'd
share this. While many of my offensive combat spell skills go up very
quickly every level through normal use, my abjuration and evocation
totally sucked. (Something like 13 when the rest were at/near 90)  So,
when I had some downtime, I came up with a way to drive them up. I made
the following "Spell practice" hotkey:
/pause 47, /cast 7
/pause 47, /cast 8
/pause 47, /cast 7
/pause 47, /cast 8
/pause 47, /cast 7

I put my lowest mana abjuration spell (minor shielding, I think) in slot
seven, and my lowest mana evocation spell in slot 8. Then, I parked my
necro in a safe spot in the city and just hit the key. If I was sitting
at the computer, I'd keep it running till I went OOM, then med up. (Or
run and do the stupid Janem and Rebby quests again. *grin*.) But even
while I was doing some other stuff around the house, I just left myself
logged in and every time I walked past the computer I'd hit the number
for that hotkey as I went by. I was able to drive those skills up into
the eighties in a fairly short time.

HTH.
