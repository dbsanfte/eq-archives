Stay in Luclin and head to Marus Seru.  Hunt near the Sanctu Seru zone it is
a little safer there.  At 26 you can get good exp from Greyhoppers and in
another few levels start pulling Stonegrabbers.  (Grabbers will be fine now
if you have a group or partner) This zone is very easy to solo because of
the way the MOBs aggro.  Only the Lightcrawlers and Zelniaks will aggro on
sight.  The others will only aggro if you are fighting one of their kind.

I levelled my necro from 24-28 there easily both soloing and with a partner.
