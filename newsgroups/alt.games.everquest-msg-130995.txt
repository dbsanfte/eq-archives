Look up a lot and you'll move forward slowly, so your slower sink
rate will still see you descending pretty fast compared to the
distance you move across the ground.

Trick here is to hit the 5 on your keypad, which will put you at level,
then look up just a little bit.  This is the slowest descent rate, slower
even than level flight, yet not noticably slower over the ground.

Oh, and I'm always in first person view, seems that if you are in any
other viewpoint you get some pretty weird responses as to sink
rate.  Since I rarely use other views, I have no idea if they are
predictable, most seem to involve me falling faster than I like.

Hmm, you'll also want to twist Selo's Accelerando in there to
keep your forward travel speed as high as possible... just don't
let the Aria fade ever.  Falling, especially with Selo's on, can
lead to a 10,000hp stop at the bottom.  But since you will be
falling at a set rate per second regardless of how fast you move
over the ground, the faster you move, the farther you can get
while still "far enough up"

Lets see, what else seems obvious but might be overlooked?
Oh, get up as far as you possibly can before leaving a surface.
Since what you are doing is a long gliding descent, you want
as much height as you can to start with.

If you are flying to avoid encounters, you'll find it fairly effective
at shortening aggro range, but note that if you -do- get the
attention of a mob he will now completely ignore your altitude
relative to him.  If you see a mob in the distance but in your
way you may want to steer a bit to pass him to one side or
another.  This is rarely necessary in DL where a competant
levitator can soar -far- out of the attentions of pretty much every
mob.  Crossing EW though, even from the top of the bridge
arches, you'll want to show a little more caution unless you
enjoy a long stern chase with a Snow Griffin on your tail... and
hoping that your drum is good enough that he's losing you, not
catching you.
