My brother started a Half-elf ranger recently, his reason for chosing this
race was that he always plays dwarfs and hasn't even been in the Freeport
area, let alone Qeynos. So I guess I should say that if you usually find
yourself playing only in one particular area, you can base your decision on
which area you play and choose a race that has a starting city away from
where you normally start.
