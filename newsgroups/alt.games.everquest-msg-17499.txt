I have two computers that are networked and cannot get the client computer
to run the patch.  The host computer has to have internet connection sharing
turned off for it to run the patch.  DSL is coming soon to my town and I
would like to be able to play on both computers (each with an account) at
the same time.  Is there a way to do this?  Is there someone out there that
does this?  Thanks in advance for any advice.
