Okay.  (cue theme from Debbie Does Dallas)

A moron is an adult mentally inferior to a child of ten years.  I am not a
moron.  This is a demonstrable fact.  I inserted your name into a movie
quote like I do with everyone else's.  You seem to interpret it to mean I
was egging my cronies on.  I do not engage in egging on as a rule, and I
haven't been in this NG long enough to have cronies.  If I were to acquire
cronies, they would be far more vulnerable to abuse from me than anyone
else, as I despise mindless hangers-on.  I can't believe that was enough
seriously to anger you.  I'm sorry you don't understand.

As you state at the bottom of your reply, "there is NO right or wrong on
this issue, only a matter of opinion."  In the case of Wantsomedrinks, I
myself probably would not have petitioned.  Most likely I would have let it
stand, thought "dumb name, no heals for you" to myself, and forgotten about
it.  What I object to is not the refutation of another's opinion, but the
refutation of another's opinion by means no more intelligent than "that's a
big load of bullshit" or "fucking ass-for-a-brain" or "shove it up your
ass."  What I was trying to say is that applying liberal coats of mindless
insults and profanity to one's post does not make one's argument more
credible.  Again, I'm sorry if I wasn't clear on that. ........Thinking
back, I'm disgusted that I rose to the bait so quickly.

Glad we agree on this.

In the context of the ongoing debate, it was a mistake for me to interject
all the material about vulgar names.  You are right that it had little, if
anything, to do with the name under discussion, Wantsomedrinks if I remember
correctly.  I contributed little to the debate with that exposition and for
that I apologize.  However, I feel that my personal guideline for names,
vulgar or otherwise, is completely valid, as is yours, Matt's, Lokari's, and
everyone else's.  I should not have clouded the question with a separate
issue.  Let me change the wording:  Exactly how does my playing skill relate
to my inclination to petition any name that violates my guideline?

See the above.  Somebody, you if I remember correctly, insulted my playing
skill.  That is a completely separate issue, one you know nothing about, and
one entirely irrelevant to the discussion.  My retort is that it takes NO
skill, NO time, and NO effort to petition, and as such, the argument is not
"blown out of the water" by my inclusion of a related point.  Here is the
question again, defined clearly enough that it cannot be misinterpreted:
Exactly how does my playing skill relate to my inclination to petition any
name that violates my guideline?

GMs have the closest thing to ultimate power in the game world.  Attempting
to "make a GM respond" is a fruitless endeavor which may eventually earn
warnings or even banning depending on how it's done.  Let me rephrase: It is
the right of any player to petition any name that violates his guideline.
As for your other question, Verant gave me the right to petition, just like
he gave it to you, Matt, Lokari, and all other players.  If and how you
choose to exercise that right is up to you.  Anyone can petition, at any
time, for any reason.  It is the Guide/GM who makes the final determination
on what is a worthwhile petition and what is not, what should be acted on
and what shouldn't, and so on.  I prefer to think of a name petition as
setting a case before the court.  I must rely on its judgment and I have no
right to complain if the court finds in favor of the defendant.  Likewise,
the defendant has no right to complain if the court judges against him; in
this case, the name under consideration violates the name rules (makes a
phrase), and ignorance of the law is not a valid excuse for breaking it.  As
for whether the desire for game immersion is "BULLSHIT.....weak at best," I
again refer you to your own statement: "there is NO right or wrong on this
issue, only a matter of opinion."  My opinion is that game immersion is
desirable and names like Wantsomedrinks can interfere with that.

Do I think the petition situation could have been handled better?  Probably.
I think a GM would be more friendly towards a player who brought his own
(unintentional?) violation to attention.  I also think it is the
responsibility of each player to read the name guidelines before choosing a
name (I know nobody -- including myself -- does this), but again, that's
just my opinion.

Let's dissect his post again.
-----------start post
"that's the biggest load of bullshit I've ever heard.  [No support.  In your
words, weak at best.]

I've always hated tattlers--some of the most annoying, idiotic, brown-nosers
ever.  And Everquest is no different.  [Could we add a few more unpleasant
adjectives here?  It's one thing to say "I disagree" and quite another to
say "I hate you, you piss me off, you're stupid and you suck."  Matt didn't
follow debating form here and was dealt with accordingly.]

In what way did that name harm you?  [He has an intelligent question, but we
have to go through the crap to reach it.  Not everyone makes that effort.
My answer would be "none," but we're talking about Lokari's standards, not
mine.]

I enjoy looking at other's names--and it's cool and challenging to develop
an interesting name within the confounds of a 2 word area."  [I agree with
what he's saying but Wantsomedrinks is hardly a challenge to invent.  I
forgave Matt the improper word choice but I notice others didn't.]
----------end post

Since he actually did have a point it seems to me that, after being flamed
for the crap that went with it, the proper response would have been for him
to rephrase in a manner that boils down to "I got overexcited, I disagree
with you, didn't mean to offend, here's what I meant to say."  Others have
done it.  It works.  Certainly it works much better than Matt's chosen
course of becoming even more offensive and less coherent.  He went from
[both paraphrased] "That's bullshit, the name didn't hurt you, you're a
tattle-tale," which at least contains one valid point of debate, to "you all
shove it up your ass," which contains zero.  If someone calls him a fool for
what he says, he should prove them wrong, not right.

> You've made him frustrated and basked in the glory of doing so.

Life fucks everybody, and it does it much more frequently, more
imaginatively, more thoroughly, and more unpleasantly than we in this NG
ever could.  Ultimately, this newsgroup is of exceptionally small concern.
Anyone who becomes frustrated that easily should put a gun in his mouth and
save himself decades of anguish.  I say that without rancor.

I am not always right.  I did not say I am always right.  I'll thank you not
to put words in my mouth.

Couldn't have said it better myself.
