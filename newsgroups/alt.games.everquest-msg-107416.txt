Ben, while this rant is not intended directly at you, I do sense a little
class envy at this point.

Let me throw out my Druid rant...

I HATE fucking druids. The little pricks have money out the wazoo and never
would cut ANYONE a break. The bastards were all terribly inconvienced in the
beginning of the game, having to cast SoW on all the "deadbeats." so you all
charged us 1 pp per. Then you got ports, and in the beginning EVERYONE paid
10 plat, that was until the Kunark and Velious zones where "your time was
way too valuable" and prices for ports went to 50 to 100 plat.

You ever have to try to buy a piece of wisdom gear? its all over inflated in
price due to all the cash rich druids. The days of 4 wis helm from Perma
going for 300 and a Charred guardian Shield going for 500 have changed,
thank god. No cleric could afford it, but all you druid fucks seems to know
to the copper what a clerics "pain threshold" for a item price.  Lessee, I
can get a wis item for a bump in wisdom, but I won't have money for spells.

Finally, Finally, finally, a cleric makes it to a level where we have
something of value. And usually whatever ress you had, everyone always
wanted the better exp, and would wait. So after two RL years of playtime a
cleric finally has a service which can make some coin. And clerics have to
symbol folks, usually to the tune of 1000 plat a week.

And Druids ALWAYS bitch. Bitch bitch bitch, Sow'ers bugged you, porting
people bothered you, people who dared to camp in a place where you could
solo bothered you. Now in later levels, you are mad because you are not a
cleric. For fuck sake, you had the world in your fingers for two years of
game time, and now that people don't bow down to you kissing your ass and
wanting you in the "end game" all the druids scream bloody murder how their
class is Fuxxored.

And now someone rants because for once in a clerics life, they make Plat. :O
Years of shit taken from you people, throwing money down a hole for armor
spells and wis gear all while getting bitched at, usually because of players
own stupidity. We blow thousands of plat on Symbols to keep you alive and
finally someone woke up and said, "hey I bet that gets expensive." and give
a cleric some gems in ONLY one dungeon.

So to druids I say SHUT THE FUCK UP!

/rant off
