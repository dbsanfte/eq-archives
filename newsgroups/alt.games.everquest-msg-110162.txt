I just suggest *not* being Iksar because you'll be pissed when all the other
shamans are running around doing a nice clicky-clicky no-mana 260 DD and
you're left agonizing over the fact that IKS is not in the Class: line in
the JBB's info.  If you really want the regen, be a troll, but since you get
regen spells anyway and you can just get a fungi or Iksar regen BP it's not
a huge factor.
