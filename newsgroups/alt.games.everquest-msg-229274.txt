Fine, show us the superior job you can do. Show us how you can
maintain a constantly evolving game 24/7 with hundreds of thousands of
users without ever having a single problem. The servers usually run
remarkably well, but shit happens sometimes. If you expect perfection
always, you'll be sorely disappointed. Always. Even from the best of
the best of the best.
