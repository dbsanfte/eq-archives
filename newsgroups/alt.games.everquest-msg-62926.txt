You say you are not getting a video beep code, does this mean the board is
not even initializing? No video BIOS or screen initialization at all?

If this is the case, it usually means the video card is not seated (you
checked) or the board is bad.

Other things to try:
Do a CMOS reset via jumper on the MB
Remove all other cards besides the Video card
Video card should be in the first PCI slot

As odd as the second suggestion sounds, I had something similar happen with
my Geforce 3 - which I replaced my Voodoo 5 with. For some reason the video
bios would not initialize with the modem I had. Tried different slots and
all sorts of combinations, but as soon as I plugged the modem in the video
would not initialize (???), the monitor would not even come out of power
save. Got a new modem, and all is well.

BTW, you really should get an AGP board. It didn't make a difference with
Voodoo's, but Nvidia actually uses the AGP features. With 64mb card, it
probably doesn't make much of a difference, but the Nvidia really had AGP in
mind when they designed the chips. If your MoBo doesn't support AGP - may be
time to upgrade that as well, Pricewatch has Athlon XP1600+ and ECS MoBo
combo for $180.
