Well here is a hint, because I see people doing this.

DON'T talk in human tongue to humans if your human tongue is bad, they
will understand LESS than you talking in halfling because you are
speaking POORLY in it and its ALSO mixing up letters. When you speak
halfling its ONLY mixing up letters. I find that when I grouped with 3
dwarves or 3 gnomes with zero or one skill I could make out what they
were saying much of the time as long as they talked in their native
tongue and I in human.

Also do this, if asking for a bind in a human area ask twice in
succession:

/auction paying 5 gold for a bind
/auction paying 5 gold for a bind

and again, do it in halfling (your native tongue you speak well)
one or even both times it will come across non garbled enough they
will get it. I have never had a problem knowing when someone was
asking for a bind whether they were an elf, gnome or halfling, its
pretty obvious really (same with sow, though my barb shaman often uses
not understanding as a means to not bother wasting what at level 12 is
still a bar of mana)

Don't, you said you can train human and that is the major impasse you
have. Simply keep putting as many points as you can into human with
maybe one or two into what ever new stuff you get. At that rate by
level 22 you be a master of human or near master.

I visited misty on my shaman and saw what you meant by lack of pelts
and I'm going to help solve it by buying and getting ruined pelts in
the WK area then coming to misty again. I'm in all patchwork now,
leather, green wicker, 3 pieces of ringmail (gotta love warrens.. )
have 56 plat and 91 gold (gotta love the unerfed bard mail quests
around halas/qeynos, warrens bronze drops, and especially the 6 GLS I
got from the only wisps I've killed (7 plat 7 gold each at lady in nk
even with my 60 charis;) )  ) so I can afford to come and make some
small patchwork for pretty much free for lil people. I was going to on
the spot in misty but saw no wolves and no ruined pelts on vendors (as
you said I guess.. no supply = / usually there is) 

I guess i picked the right starting area as a barb shaman BIG time,
all the patchwork supply in the world, 3 bard mails at once when you
can get through bb about level 4 (since every gnoll on the way in was
camped it was so easy ;) ) and even got a polar bear cloak from one
clover shipment to WK (where I was picking up a bard mail and doing
the 3 gold lion delight quest anyway) 

I know that rivervale and gfay were horribly nerfed though.. stupid
verant. Those bard and other quests NEED to be there on a new server
for people to get what little money they need for spells and
patchwork.
