Yea, but feel free to ignore it anyway, an it please you. :)

}>Err... you mean only one would agree with you? :)
}(Of course. I am the prototype of Van Vogt's Right Man.)

Which book was that?  Haven't read any of his stuff in a while.

}It was an argument in logic. The history of Wicca
}is fact, therefore only one answer could be
}correct.

History is rarely entirely fact.  It would be, if there weren't so many 
historians involved.

}Opinions might vary as to what Wicca might be, and
}still be valid, but not how it came about.

The only way to truly test the validity of a historical opinion is to go 
back and watch the event for yourself.  Otherwise, you open yourself up to 
inheriting the biased interpretation of events of every historian 
passing the information between you and the original event.

There does seem to be evidence of a majority consensus.  I don't think 
that necessarily invalidates other opinions, though.

}>}This is a matter of history. If you can find

}>I'm too lazy for that, you'll have to settle for evidence of the existence

}They cannot document it, or at least, I have never
}found any who could. And, I have tried. 

Try contacting followers of that 'little known faith group'. :)  

Alternatively, if history is a matter of fact, as you say, and only 
exists if it's documented, does that mean that if a tree falls in a forest 
and there's no historian there to document it, it never fell over?

}As far as I know it was Gardner who first used the
}phrase Wicca (I think he actually said 'Wica'), to
}describe the religion. I may be wrong here, and may need correcting.

I thought it had roots in other languages.  Like, anglo-saxon, mostly.

If we stop saying 'amoeba' and start saying 'ameba' does that mean they 
weren't amebas before that time?  Could they therefore not have caused 
dysentery?

If we borrow the word 'omelet' from french, and use it for the first time 
in english, does that naturally preclude frenchmen from having previously 
wrapped food in eggs?

}>So... we agree?  Is that allowed? :)
}No, we don't...

Ah, right then.  Have at thee, foul varlet!

}there must be something else I haven't picked up on yet.

Did you try the inflatable sheep? (sorry, couldn't resist. :) )

Two other interesting things I found:

http://www.americanwicca.com/faq

Wherein being a wiccan is described with a notable absence of reference to 
Gardner.  In fact, the only reference to Gardner I can find on the whole 
site is the gardnerian opening ritual in the curiously named "Book of 
Shadows" portion of the site.  There's also a distinct lack of any 
reference to Qabala.  I had hopes for the "Magickal Table of 
Correspondence", but no, alas. :)

http://www.witchvox.com/xtrads.html

Whrein is found a brief and incomplete compendium of pagan traditions, 
many of whom are Wiccan of one stripe or another, and very few of which 
mention Kaballah or Gardner.  But really a fascinating site, independent 
of any disagreement we may have.

My current prevailing theory:  convergent invention.  A bunch of different 
Wiccas popped up at the same time, but Gardner wrote a book and many of 
the others did not, so he got the lion's share of the credit.
