Right now my armor is a mish mosh of chainmail and leather.  I can bump things up from leather to chain like my legs, and a cape,
wrist bands, and some other areas but there's only a 2 ac bump for those items and it'll cost me a huge amount of plat (relative to
my level) to boost.

So, I think I have 65 plat and I'll be able to buy the armor that'll bump my AC up by 4.

How much is a bump of 4 going to help me?  It doesn't seem like much.  I'm a lvl 11 Paladin.  Is the AC number just a modifyer of
sorts?  Sort of like the damage ona weapon?  My sword has a damage of 20 but I hit for 29 points now.  Is AC something like that?

Or should I just hang on to the money until I can start to afford plate?  Or should I forget it all together and just worry about
leveling up until I can start fighting mobs that will drop good stuff for me to wear?
