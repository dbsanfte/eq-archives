... unless you're not wearing a dress ;)

ring wars are great fun.  never officially been in on one so i don't know
anything about the loot, but since my guild is on CoV faction, i go there
and just smack each giant once and get my faction point :P

there's tons of quests and lots of very nice items and armor to be had from
velious.  not to mention lots of mobs for every lvl from 30 to 60 (even more
so with luclin and PoP sucking away all the high lvls that used to farm
'em).  the guild i'm with is currently working on outfitting everybody with
their ToV/SS armor, so i've been spending lots of time there working up my
CoV faction lately.
