OK, I just picked up the Everquest Trilogy, since it seemed a great
bargain (less than the cost of one month play).  However, I've got a
lot of questions, even after thoroughly reading the manual and
browsing lots of web sites.  The manual included in the box is
extremely out of date, and very wrong in many places.

- I've noticed people post here about returning after a long absence
of more than a year.  How is that accomplished? Aren't the characters
wiped out after 6 months?  Also, is there a way to take a 1 month
break from the game (say, for vacation)?

- Where is the tutorial the manual mentions?  Even revisions.txt
mentions the tutorial.  I've got some files for a tutorial, but no
tutorial.exe (even after starting testeverquest.exe and having it
download files).

- The manual says you can tell the number of people on each server
when starting up, but all I can ever get is a green "up" next to them,
but no numbers.  Is it possible to do this, or is the feature gone for
good?

- After the "Stromm" server was "(newbie)".  What does this mean?
Is it specifically for newbies, or the one newbies are requested to go
to first, or is it the newest server?

- It took me forever to get a name that was accepted.  When it was
accepted, there was a pause before it was confirmed.  However, on all
the rejected names there was no pause at all before rejecting, making
me think that the game rejected it locally instead of querying the
servers.  Are there rules about how a name is rejected?

- The UI is baffling me.  It is completely different from the
manual, and the online manual does not discuss it.  I'm a dwarf, and
the chat window hides dwarves next to me except for their hair.  Yes,
I can move it around and shrink it, however it feels strange to be a
dwarf and have to look _down_ in order to see what's around me.  Is
there a way to use the old UI?  Are there better docs on the new UI
anywhere?  Ie, how to change camera views, etc.

- The keybindings are confusing me too.  I've remapped quite a lot of
them, and I've basically spent the last two days doing this, looking
at the UI, and figuring out how to walk - not a lot of fun.  The
mouse-look is very very strange, since there's lots of mouse
acceleration looking up and down, but it's very slow looking side to
side, so when I try to turn I end up looking up or down at the same
time.  So I'm forced to use keys.  I tried setting up WASD, but there
are still problems since there are no side-step keys.  I can use
control for this (after unmapping all the control-WASD entries) but it
feels extremely clumsy.  I feel like an idiot walking around the place
doing a walk-stop-turn-walk-stop-turn (and a bigger idiot for falling
off of balconies).  Are there better solutions here?
