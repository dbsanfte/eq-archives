If I remember correctly..

The formula goes something like this.

/who all (insert class here) (insert level range here) count.

So finding a count on all wizards 40 50 (that are non anon or rp,mind
you) would look like...

/who all wizard 40 50 count.

It should also be noted that you can leave the replace the class
argument with race.  Or  you can leave class and race out entirely,and
get a flat count of everybody in that level range.  For instance, you
can see how many people are online that are between 50 to 60.


By not listing the "count" argument, you can give a list (or partial
list) of everybody in the search range.
