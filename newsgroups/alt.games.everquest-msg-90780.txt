Enchanter, shaman, cleric, wizard, melee, melee
Enc, shm, cle, melee, melee, melee
Dru, cle, wiz, melee, melee, melee

REQUIRED:  Rogue, 2 clerics, monk, warrior.  Not required but kinda insane
to go without (I mean, most places you shouldn't have trouble root-parking
adds):  2 enchanters.

<shrug>  Just keep in mind that overpulls are common and respawn is fast, so
you can't fart around...gotta kill stuff fast and move on.  My
recommendation is hardly the only good way to do it, it's just a quick
example.  Want to replace a couple melee with wizards/mag/dru/nec working as
pure damage dealers?  Sure, go ahead.  Make any changes you want. :)
