Reavers aren't quite that hard.   We were killing them with one group, no
cleric.   A level 58 warrior (me at the time), a 59 rogue, a 55 druid and a 54
druid, and 2 54 enchanters.  We killed Neh Ashir's reaver, and Neh Ashir
herself twice while waiting for the Wraith of Jaxiom to spawn.  Neither fight
was close.
