No, a Necro cannot serve Qeynos.

As you yourself noted, the problem is not with the Archetype system,
it's with the alignment system.

By forcing Necros to be only Evil and Elementalists to be only Good,
that's defeating the Archetype system.  If you could become Necro or
Elementalist, then do the betrayal quest, then you could be a Good
Necro or an Evil Elementalist.
