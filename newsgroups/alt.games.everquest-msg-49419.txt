Bytes as a hardware storage device?  I don't think that was ever the case.
My first PC was a Commodore 64 in '82 or so.  It didn't have a hard drive or
floppy...it had a tape drive that came separately and used audio cassette
tapes.  RAM was at 64kb (that's right KILObytes).

My 2nd PC was around '85, an Atari ST 1040.  Dual floppies, no hard drive,
though you could buy a huge 10MB drive for around $500 I think.  I had 512kb
RAM in that one, though I bumped that sucker up to a meg!  Only cost me
about $125. :)

By the time I bought my 3rd, "PC" meant "IBM/IBM clone."  That was an 8088
(then came 286, 386, 486, Pentium....) with a 10MB drive.  I paid $240 to
upgrade to a 40MB.  About a year later I upgraded to *80* MB for just $240!
And hell, when I upgraded to a 240(around there)MB HD it was only $240!

One of my computers now has a 20GB hard drive...I think I may have a 40 in
one as well, but that 20 that I bought over a year ago is STILL plenty for
me.  Hell, I think I could get by on a 10.
