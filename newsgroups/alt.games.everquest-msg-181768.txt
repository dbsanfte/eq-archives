I was playin' around last night and while eating, decided to work on my 
dodge and defense skills so set my bard up, started singing the heal 
song (could start up if needed, but was eating) and agrod a light blue 
who started beating on me for 1's and 2's and the occasional double 
digit hit.  Everything healed up a bit after with the heal song playing. 
  The thing I noticed tho, in an hour and a half, I didn't notice any 
skillups.  Are skillups determined in part by the damage done or is it 
that the mob was light blue?
