You mean preschool stuff like making paragraphs? Hey, 12th grade or
not at least I got the concept.

I think it does.

Its pretty common for such products, then you can cancel and not be
charged.

Well then you'd call your credit card company and not be liable for
the purchases which were fraudulent. That is how credit works.

I think people should shower me with money. Thinking it doesn't make
it so.

That sounds like a tag line in a video game, "Stealing from max powers
is a bad idea!"

I'd also not give "up to easyly", since I don't know them so I'd not
be giving things up to them.

Evidently we have credit cards. If we are what we say we are and have
credit cards, something which you evidently can't get, what does that
make you? After reading your very large single paragraph full of so
many errors I dont' think you should be calling other people out about
their lack of education.
