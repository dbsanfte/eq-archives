Hi! My RL Wife's 35 human bard is looking for new hunting grounds.... She
wants an area with good pickup groups. We have all the expansions, she has
enjoyed the Karanas very much, HHK as well, Unrest until 35 and now wants a
new challenge. She hated the FM and LOIO. Also she wants a new drum, but
Mistmore on Drinal seems to be constantly empty. TIA.
