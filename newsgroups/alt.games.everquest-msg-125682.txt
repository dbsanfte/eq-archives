I did the med bounce for about 44 levels as a cleric.  It really
does work.

I swung my weapon, sat, waited for med to trigger, stood up
and swung again, repeat till mob dead or I'm FM.

FM literally took no longer to reach with this approach than
if I sat full time.  I thought it would be proportional to time
spent sitting, as you do... but its not.  NO LOSS AT ALL.

Hmm, I said to myself, thats a funny result.  And I started
sitting less.  With a decent connection and a fair sense of
rythm (I do play a bard as well)  I was able to sit only for
the half second around the med tic.  And still NO LOSS.

Amazing.  But contrary to what you would think, the server
calculates the amount of mana you get back when you med
strictly on what you are doing at the instant of the tic.

This isn't an "apparantly" till the server catches up.  Its all
the time, over months of playing, full time using this sort
of practice as my only means of medding most of the time.
I could group with a my level cleric, both of us traking heals
in turn, both with same clarity status.  Other cleric sits except
when healing, I sit only when necessary, both running the same
mana flow.  And I did about as much melee damage as a
paladin my level on top of my regular heal/stun/root/whatever
contribution to my groups.

Unless this has been changed in the past 6 months or so
(As I say, I gave this up at around level 44, when paladin
damage really started outclassing me) the server only
looks at whether you are sitting/medding/whatever on the
tic, and gives you a set amount based on that status.
