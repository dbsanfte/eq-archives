I think today topped the list for beggars.  First an Iskar monk hits me up
for a sow in the middle of a fight while I am in wolf form and don't even
have sow among my active spells.  I guess he expected me to stop fighting,
mem the spell sow him and then go back to what was becoming a close fight
with a mob who was constantly breaking root.  Then a little later I see a
level 19 with a Conscript and a blue lesser charbone on him.  He was taking
a lot of damage so I pull the skel which I had been in the midst of snaring
when it jumped on him off his back so he can kill the conscript.  I root it
and he begins to beat on it.  I go to a near by ledge and begin to med back
my lost mana when the next thing I know he is asking me to heal him so he
can kill the skel.  He has about a bubble of health and the skel is doing
damage to him far faster than I could possible heal him, which means if I
try to heal him and he dies anyway the skel aggros on me and I have too
little mana to kill it and either die or have to try to zone.  He says to
kill it so I do so and heal him with my remaining mana and he goes about his
business.  Earlier in the day the same player had asked me to heal and buff
him and I had done so freely even though the process cost me another round
of meditation.  This did not especially bother me as I often try to help out
the lower levels who I figure are having a hard time in what can be a very
difficult zone.  What did bother me though was the a few minutes after the
last healing he was trying to sell an ivy bp and buy a set of Ry'gor which
not even my lvl 40 ranger can yet afford.  This left a bit of a bad taste in
my mouth for if the guy could afford to buy Ry'gor at 19 surely he could
afford to donate to those who had been helping to keep him alive all
morning.  Stuff like this is the reason that casters are becoming
increasingly hostile to buff beggars and their ilk.
