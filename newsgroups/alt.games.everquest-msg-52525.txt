GMs are like cops, they do =not= have to abide by the rules.

Just as very few cops will ticket you for driving five miles over
the limit, despite this being blatantly illegal, GMs also have
the power to ignore the rules if they wish.

What the rules are is a fallback position, the GM doesn't have
to say "no I won't res you because I think you are lying or because
I feel like you deserve the exp loss, or even because I'm in a bad
mood"  instead, they can point to a specific rule that says they aren't
supposed to.

You may die from an identical bug an hour later and get a different
GM who -will- be happy to res you.

Unfortunately, you can't double team the GMs, since the first thing
they will do is look at the log under your name.  Once one GM
decides not to help you on a problem, you aren't going to be
able to get one of the others to do it instead; just like cops, they
protect each others decisions, even if they think its a bad call.
