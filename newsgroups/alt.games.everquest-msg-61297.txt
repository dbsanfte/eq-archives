From the SoL site:
"
Again, no features of EverQuest: Shadows of Luclin will be lost even at 128M
of RAM, except for the ability to see the new player models. The rest of the
rich world, along with the new graphics enhancements, will work. The Shadows
of Luclin still has more zones, more new NPCs, and more exciting encounters
than any other expansion, as well as a new class AND a new race to enjoy. As
you upgrade your computer to 256MB and 512MB of RAM, and obtain future
graphics cards, your EverQuest experience will be enhanced right along with
them."

Sounds like the GM maybe didn't know what the hell she was talking about (or
at least, I HOPE she doesn't know better than whoever put that on the SoL
site!).
