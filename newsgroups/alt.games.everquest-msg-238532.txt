>>>  I don't buy much at all.

That could be your problem.  The bazaar game is a great way to make money if
you are patient.  Start looking for deals, recognizing when someone is
selling something for a good price, and then put it on your trader for more.

Buy from live players in your servers auction channel, and sell on your
trader.  You can put items on your trader for slightly above normal price
(I'm talking items more than 1k), since people will most often pay extra for
the convenience of not having to /auc for 2 hours.

I've got 150k and growing in the bank from mostly doing this.
