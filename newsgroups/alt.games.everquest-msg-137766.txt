I am a Ranger in Surefall Glade. I am on a quest to take a Scout sword and
get in sharpened and return it to the giver with a snakeskin and a fang.
Here is my problem. Is it a large or giant king snake? Is it a gnoll fang or
snake fang? I have gone back to ask but he will not give me the formula
again. I have a long sword that does 6 damage and the long sword he give I
believe does 10 damage. I really need the extra damage.

Second problem. I have been taking fangs to cpt tilly in qeynos. I get
experience and he gives me moonstones. I take the moonstones to mcneal in
the fishes tale pub. I get experience and some beer. Where do I take the
beer, when I talk to mcneal he just tells me " Come on and show these people
how to drink like a fish". I would really like the help. Thanks in advance.
