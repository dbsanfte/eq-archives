Subject: Cheap Haste for a Pally?

Been scrimping and saving for my 41 pally who has no haste item and am up to
about 2200 plat in the bank.  Yesterday I saw Silver Chitin Hand Wraps for 2400
on my server in bazaar and am thinking as soon as I can that I'll probably be
going for those.  Any other suggestions?
