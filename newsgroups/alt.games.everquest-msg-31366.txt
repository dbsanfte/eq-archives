That is an idea of course, was considering doing that but i would hate
being thought of as a beggar, that was when i asked for a SOW outside
thurgadin i offered the giant militia longsword as a trade.

Anything in skyshrine that sees trough hide/sneak?

Another question that came up when playing my human rogue sneaking
around in BB, i did try to loot some gnoll corpse but got the message
saying that i was not allowed to do that at this time, kept moving and
soon thereafter got attacked, think that my invis dropped when trying
to loot but i got no message and the hide hot button was still
pressed, maybe this is a known bug but that is shurely frustrating.

Will try to get the CS key and maybe take a view of WW, feels rather
cool when some lvl 50+ asks what the .... is a lvl 3 doing here :)
