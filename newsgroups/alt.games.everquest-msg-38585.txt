	Um, yeah, it is.  When was the last American server opened, again?

	They lost numbers all right.  Again: 2/3rds their business now comes from
other countries.

	You are effectively forced to play the expansions because if you don't,
you will marginalize yourself.  Simply not being able to go where everyone
else is going is a significant penalty.

	Luclin will include new advancement options for L60 characters, and
reportedly new epic quests (reports differ between epic armor sets and
"second-level" epic weapons that require you to turn in your original epics).
Despite the fact that the TCC will make the bulk of the content useless to
them, high-level players will have to buy Luclin or they'll get left behind.
