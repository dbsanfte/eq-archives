Hh - don't have to go far for those BA girdles - got about 5 on the chimp I
can just switch one over. Initially I handed her a FBSS so forgot to pass on
a girdle too.

Mentioning the Twighlight Sea elementals made me remember I picked up a
plate class glove there earlier but had passed it onto a shadowknight. It
was an Earthen Gauntlet  10ac 5str, not too shabby at all and saves some
shopping ; )

Quite a few people have mentioned the Hero bracer - I think that's my best
bet and they are fairly comon too.

Yah - I definately could do with some +sta in the earings, I was thinking
Wolf Fang earrings for a while till I spent 4 fruitless hours waiting for
one to drop in Dawnshroud.

I quite a bit of time there with Chimp but soon decided without tracking it
was a bit of a bad joke. All I was doing was keeping the spawns clicking
over nicely and passing druids would just pick off the nameds... I plan on
taking the bard there when she get's older though ; )

Thanks for your suggestions- you twigged my mind for stuff I already had but
forgot about.
