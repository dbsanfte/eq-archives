I brought this very issue up a week or so back.  I thought that it may
indicate a large number of players are jumping ship and selling off their
items, and turning around and selling their PP for real world money that has
led to an over supply of PP people are trying to sell.

Another possibility is that with LDoN dumping more PP rewards the value of
ingame PP has dropped.

If you go to IGE they claim they have had to drop prices because it is
rumored that their competitors have access to a duplication bug in the game
that allows them to make tons of PP.  Personally I think that is just BS.
If there is anything in the game causing large quantities of PP to be
generated then I would think it was one of SOE employees running a side
business.
