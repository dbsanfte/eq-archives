Ohhh, so that explains it.  At least on Test.  I checked the recipe list 
on the Mixing Bowl last night and found Celestial Essences listed and 
was questioning why they were there since I thought it was a Rogue only 
recipe.  I haven't looked at the recipe list for the Mortar and Pestle 
for 3 - 4 days so I can't say if they are gone or not.
