I'm not sure about that.  If I were selling stuff in game for RL money, and
the game company started nailing my customers, I'd rather have them banned
than left in game sans items, bitching to other players about how they spend
$50 or $100 or whatever and lost the items.  That would probably be bad for
business.

I think that with enough logging, they could detect this.  Suppose they had
logs of every transaction going back a few weeks, and had logs of other
player interaction (for example, a log recording whenever an XP award was
split among a group, and who the members were, and a log of who sent tells
to whom, and a log of zonings).  From this kind of data, a graph of trades
could be constructed, and from the other logs, the edges of that graph could
be assigned weights that indicate the degree of contact the players involved
had before that trade.  If SOE then bought some plat from IGE, and then
started with the contact from that, I bet they could figure out quite a bit
about who bought and sold stuff, and who is working for IGE, just following
edges with a low prior-contact weighting that connect vertices that are on a
large number of edges.

(This reminds me of some work I've seen on analyzing "From", "To", and "CC"
line content on mail messages to figure out a given person's social network,
as part of spam detection).

I think this is an interesting enough problem that SOE could probably find
someone at a university who would be interested in doing the work for them
in exchange for access to the data and permission to use it in their
research.  Economics researchers, for example, would probably *love* to get
access to the kind of logs I'm talking about.
