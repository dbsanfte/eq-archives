Clerics have not only nuke stuns, but zero damage stuns, both do an
admirable job of interrupting casters.  Since stuns have a very short
cast time, its quite possible to actively interrupt by watching for
the "begins to cast" message, except some mobs have a very short cast
time themselves and are hard to interrupt becuase of this.  Chain
stunning is possible once a cleric gets his third stun spell, with a
little care you can keep one mob continuously stunned this way, not
exactly interrupting, but rather preventing stuns (and melee and procs
and anything else)

Sadly, some mobs are immune to stun.  They are usually still
succesptible to bash, however, a recent addition to the cleri's bag of
tricks; unlike other bash classes, clerics are better off with a
weapon+shield combo anyway, you won't see any degredation of their
damage output (save in the rare case of a cleric with a really great
twinky two hand blunt weapon but a crappy one hander) and cleric
damage output usually isn't important anyway.

Bard charm doesn't interrupt casting, however if the mob is charmed
while casting a spell, PC's become immune to its effects (in a non-PvP
environment, that is)  Not sure about other charm classes, but I
suspect the same is true of them, I think I've seen similar "gnoll
shaman tries to cast a spell on you but you are protected" messages
from her.

Mez interrupts casting.  A very good bard strategy is to slap mez on
the victim and just keep running it continuously, every 4 seconds
another interrupt, this stops almost all casting; only spells with
short cast time that the mob happens to start just after a mez lands
and is broken manage to get thru.  Sadly, some mobs are immune to mez,
very often the same ones that are immune to stun.

I've never seen bash fail to interrupt a spell if landed successfully
on a mob (which means it did damage in between "starts to cast" and
the spell going off)

Fear may not interrrupt (I'm not sure, haven't tried it for this) but
it does prevent casting once its stuck.  In fact if ther'es a mob you
really can't afford to have cast or proc, this is a great way to stop
it.  For boots and suspender approach, fear, then chain stun and chain
mez.  That mob isn't going to be doing -anything-
