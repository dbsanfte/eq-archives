There should be 'light tank' and 'heavy tank' categories.

Heavy tanks:
Warrior
Paladin
Shadow Knight

Light tanks:
Ranger
Monk
Necro and Mage Pets

With decent gear the light tanks can tank low blues easily.
I have a high level monk and can tank just fine (since the nerf rollback)
in exp groups with my friends.
