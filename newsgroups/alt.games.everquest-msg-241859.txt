I have some characters on Drinal.  My 10th level high elf Paladin was
coming from Butcher Block (Nice new sky, but DAMN those skelly's are
nasty, and horrible lag) into GFay.  Things are normal there.  It was
day, so it was foggy with misty diffused light. Dark at night. (No
firebeetles in GFay.)  Later on I loaded up my 3rd level wood eld
Druid, and it was dark, so I summon my Globe of Fireflies.  Hours
later it's still dark, so i do a time check...game time 8AM.  I do an
ooc shout and somebody replies that it is greater fayDARK, but it has
never been this dark during the day.  The problem was, I kept being
surprised by orc Cents, and having to run back to the lifts.  I
checked again with my pally today and it was pitch dark at 12PM.

Anybody else notice this?


Patrick
