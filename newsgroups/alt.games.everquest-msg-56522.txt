Get to level 6, no lose corpse then for a long time. You can get to
six right outside qeynos where you'd never lose your corpse. Kill
firebeetles until they are no longer XP, while killing skels for bone
chips. DON'T give the bone chips to lashun for xp, intstead go to the
pally guild and a guy is there in plate in the courtyard by the 2 guys
who look like they are giving each other man love (one of them is
named chesguard) say to the pally guy "i will crush the undead"

get the box he gives you and put a bone chip in each slot and combine
(6 bone chips total) Give that to him and get another box and repeat.
This is REALLY good xp. You should wait to go until you've killed
enough decayed and such to get 36 or so bone chips so you can stand
there and do it a bunch at once.

You'll be 6 in no time, THEN go to blackburrow and such and branch out
more.
