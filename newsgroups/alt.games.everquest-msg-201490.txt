Cheapest if I sign up for 24 months, but I'm not sure I want to, in
truth.

If I had to be hospitalised for along period, then an EQ subscription
makes so much sense, but I'm still active and frankly I'm finding EQ a
little boring, now that the inital fun/challenge has worn of. I'm
finding the "end product" a little wanting.

At some levels, I can see more progress is working in my garden.

I think I'll play it for another three months, by which time I will be
heartily sick of it and swmbo will be happy for me to potter in the
garage/workshop of an evening, rather than requiring my prescence {:-).
