Ok time to drag up an old thread, just cuz im curious....

Did anyone see more than the previously advertized zones?  I dint but
hey alot gets missed by these eyes...
How bout new creatures.....  the only "New" creature I saw that wasnt
really advertised was the new steeds, but not the ones you can buy,
one of the wild ones.... (conned green to a 52).   the rest appeard to
be some variation of previous world creatures.... Mushrooms, Flowers,
Trolls, Ogres, etc....

I dint even run into a Luggald yet, but lots of time to explore..
Anyone see a Luggald in acction yet?
One of the NPC's on the first Island you come to (think she is a monk)
mentions them and that they have a robe she is quite intrested in
getting along with a piece of glass.


Welp, good hunting to you..
