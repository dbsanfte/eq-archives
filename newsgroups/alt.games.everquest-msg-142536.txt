Merit is entirely a matter of opinion. So you're right, it isn't
meaningless, but it has no actual concrete attributes. Functionally,
it's meaningless in this discussion.

Take your average 16-year old, and she's going to say that Britney is
great, and she's not even going to know or care who the Byrds are. To
her, Britney has merit and the Byrds do not. And from her perspective,
she's completely right. She's a nitwit, of course, but that's neither
here nor there. I was a nitwit at 16, too, probably. Well, maybe not.

>Have you ever heard a song redone by another group and done better?

Yeah. Just about anything by Dylan :)

But I blaspheme - Dylan is still close to God as far as I'm concerned.

Exactly! Hence the idea of a merit-based system Sanjian mentioned
(though didn't profess support for) can't ever work.

I tried to identify my favorite type once, and got a headache. I
listen to far too wide a range to have any hope of labeling - a side
effect perhaps of having been raised on folk, and having been a folk
singer/guitarist/writer myself for awhile.

A glance at my 500+ CD collection shows the artist with the largest
representation is Gary Numan, followed closely by Bob Dylan. And after
that it fragments into, well, almost 500 different directions.

In general, though, it's a fair bet that if they play it on the radio
here, I won't like it. Aside - Why is it that I'm living in the third
largest metropolitan area (Chicago) in the country, and there isn't a
radio station worth listening to?
