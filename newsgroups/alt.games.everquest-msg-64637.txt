Yeah.  5 threads combine to make a patch, 3 patches plus glowing bile to
make a swatch, 5 swatches plus 4th shawl to make 5th shawl.  You need a
total of 75 threads and 5 biles.

I was fortunate enough to get into a Velks group where nobody else was doing
the quest, so I go to keep all the threads that dropped.

It could be worse.  You can at least make your own vials of mana for the
Wu's.  (I recommend skipping the crystal silk and jumping straight to Wu's,
but get to 115 on the quivers first.)

I did my first attempt on the fifth shawl at 106 tailoring.  It failed.  So
I killed lots and lots and lots of spiders, got it to 151, and succeeded.

I plan on getting it to 158 before I make the attempt on the 6th shawl.
