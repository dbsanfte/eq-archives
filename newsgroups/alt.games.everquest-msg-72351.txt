Sorry this is not quitre the right place to ask this question but its
related to evererquest in that it will clear upa  problem. I have a geforce
3ti500 64mb card witha  TV out port, does that mean i could plug a s-video
cable to the card then plug the other end into a s-video port on a tely
would it work? Trying to get the bigscreen so that i can watch DVDs on the
telly while playing them on the computer the other reason is to see what EQ
is like on the big screen any ideas is it possible or have i got the wrong
idea about what a tv out port does on the card? Many thanks and sorry this
is not strictly EQ though it will benefit it lol.
