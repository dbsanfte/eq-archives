Heck, with fear kiting, you don't even need a healer most of the time,
provided you're fighiting outside and know the area well.  SKs are
amazing versitile (or however you spell that).  With Fear Kiting,
Feign Death pulling, undead tracking, self healing, snare, megataunts,
corpse recovery and a limited supernuke, they add an amazing amount of
utility to any group they're in... About the only thing they lack from
thier parent class are Screaming Terror and manadumping... and not
having the latter is probably actually a benefit to SKs to begin with.

It's useful, but the superior hit points of the SKs make it a much
more viable tactic for them... That, and a SK at half life is much
less likely to die than a necro still at full.   The troll regen
doesn't hurt, either.
