- Four new missions are available that take you back to Qeynos, Unrest, 
Befallen, and Hate's Fury.

From patch msg:


 *** Missions ***
 ---------------------------------- 
 - Savil Tranquilsong has made an important breakthrough in his work 
uncovering the history of Unrest and is looking for adventurers around 
levels 55 to 70 to assist him. Seek him out in the Butcherblock Mountains if 
you are interested in helping.
- Rumors have been circulating of increased activity around Hate's Fury and 
a growing discontent among the merchants of the Broken Skull Clan. A 
merchant in the Crypt of Nadox is looking to hire a few hearty souls around 
levels 55 to 70 to help keep the Clan in check.
 - Guard Freklin in Qeynos Hills has gotten himself into hot water after 
being caught sleeping on the job and is now stuck on gnoll watch. He is 
looking for adventurers around levels 15 to 35 to help him get back into the 
good graces of the guard.
 - The ancient necromancer Marnek Jaull has returned to the dark halls of 
Befallen and kidnapped the daughter of a paladin of Prexus for use in his 
evil rituals. Derin Mausrel, uncle of the kidnapped girl, has traveled to 
West Commons in search of adventurers around levels 30 to 40 to help him 
rescue his niece and destroy the necromancer once and for all.

 ----------------------------------


Any idea if they are instanced or not?  Can't wait to get home and try them 
out.  Imaging a lvl 70 Torklar!!  hehehe
