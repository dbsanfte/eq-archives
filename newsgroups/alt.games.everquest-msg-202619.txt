Good one. I bet it goes over his head though :)>>>>

Won't go over my head as I played that game too and it can't hold a candle to
this one.  Crash you still can't explain how me getting a KEI affects your game

newbie zones and /shouts across the zone how much tougher it used to be. 
You're so lame.  Worry about yourself.
