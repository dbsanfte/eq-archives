First you MOAN about losing manaburn. It so unfair. When they add new
content you MOAN about paying a nominal fee to download it. How
terrible for you.

They should just give it away, along with abolshing the monthly fees.
Let everyone play for free. Just think how "wonderful" that would be.
I can see it now, a thousand people in Gfay shouting, "anyone have any
free stuff" in unison!

Paying means you have to be interested enough to pay a little. You
have a stake and you don't treat the place like a toilet. BTW, Usenet
is free, look at the people we get here. We get some really neat
people, and then we get the Tidy-bowl man, or ETP, the psycho
tidy-bowl man.
