LMAO "consider the children" - do people REALLY say that??

For a lot of people here, living under the the threat of 'terrorist action'
is nothing new. In that respect things are very much 'as they were 1 month
ago'. I realise it's different for some (but not all) of the citizens of the
US (I just flew back from spending 2 weeks in the US. My first trip
incidentally). While visiting your country I saw several in-depth news
reports on the matter of biological and chemical terrorist attacks, and it
appears most of the experts in your country are discounting the possibility
of them happening. Germs and chemicals are very hard to acquire and even
more difficult to disperse effectively. Chemicals are a little easier of the
two but most governments bucked-up their contingency plans after Tokyo.

The only thing that has really changed in the last 2 weeks, now the
shockwaves of horror and disbelief are subsiding pretty much everywhere
apart from in NYC, is that the people of the US have seen that if someone
hates you enough, they will find a way to hurt you no matter how big your
armies are. And while I agree wholeheartedly with hunting down and punishing
those responsible for the recently televised atrocity, nuking Bin Laden
isn't going to cure much simply because he was clever enough to build his
al-Qhaiyda (sp?) as a loose, "cell"-based organisation, which are extremely
difficult to 'destroy'. Still, we're all in it for the long-haul now. . .
I guess this is exactly what the chinese mean when they talk of 'interesting
times'.
