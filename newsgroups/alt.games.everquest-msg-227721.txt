We do the same, if we remember. After you've done that many missions,
typically yes, most augments rot. The only augments I've seen anyone
take in the last 30 or so missions were the insanely rare hp and mana
ones and a few ppl taking a resist just to stick in an empty slot until
they pick up something better. With my rogue I check chests and open
them and the last couple were practially insulting. one had one of the
12pp trash items in it, the other had 2. Illusion potions are semi rare
and augments very rare from what I've seen. With the caster spells,
because of the stupidly long refresh they put on them, I just don't
bother. I'm not going to clear 3 slots in my spell bank just to avoid
the tedius wait for the gem to activate after loading. The rewards
aren't worth the time spent standing around.

Plus you can't get another mission while anyone is in the old dungeon so
there's even less incentive to daudle around.
