I feel that I did the right thing.  He was too upset from the hard time 
he had.  He doesn't have the maturity to just stop playing when he gets 
upset so Mom had to step in and handle it.

We may not be the perfect parents but we love our son and we never want 
bad things to happen to him.  We try our hardest to make sure he is 
healthy and happy all the time.  It's not easy.
