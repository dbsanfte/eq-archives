I got the DX 8 off of windows update. I installed the basic SB Live Value
drivers that came with my PC I then upgraded to the newest win ME drivers
from creative.com. I installed the video drivers off of the dell resource CD
then updated them via win update. I tried the detonator XP drivers from the
Nvidia website but I dont think they are WHQL certified. If I use the
drivers from nvidia instead of dell/ms I lose alot of cool features like the
digital vibrance and TV out. I have tried many different combos of drivers
untill win ME was thoroughly confused lol. I just did a fresh reinstall the
other day using all the exact same drivers it had when it was shipped to me.
But its still messed up! I have not changed any settings or even touched any
of the hardware when I reinstalled. I was lookin around my device manager
and I noticed there are like 6 things all sharing IRQ 11 including one of my
NIC cards my video card and something called ACPI PCI steering or some
thing.

This frustrates the hell out of me as im pretty technical when it comes to
computers(just set up my home network) and it drives me nuts when I cant
find whats wrong even after multiple formats and reinstalls.
