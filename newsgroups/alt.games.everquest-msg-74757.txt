Yes, it pisses them off, momentarily, until the tank regains agro.  But
then, I can take the damage for that short time, and the slow is highly
effective at reducing the amount of damage that the tanks take, which I then
often have to heal.  In groups I generally have my best Malise , Enstill,
GHeal, buff slot, Can II, Alacrity, Togor's (whichever I have now), and my
best DD which I almost never use.  When Soloing, I replace Alacrity and slow
with my best two DoTs.  I don't generally fight with 3-4 tanks, I tend to
group with friends in less than optimal groups, because I enjoy being with
them.
