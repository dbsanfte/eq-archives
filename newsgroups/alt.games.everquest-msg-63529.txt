Does SOL update the graphics in all the areas or just the new areas?

I seemed to remember reading some time ago that it would only be using
the new graphics engine in the SOL areas but I saw a post in another
forum that said there would be a second disk updating all the areas. I
can't find anything addressing this on their website. Anyone have the
scoop?????
