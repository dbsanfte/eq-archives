I weary of sites that fall victim to their own popularity. There really 
should be a better way to break-even on non-profit sites than 
popups/banners/ and "special exclusive subscriber features".

A minor profit at best...

I hope we never require that spammers be profitable before they're 
treated as spammers.

I think most of these garbage sites disappear after a few months... 
either dead to lack of interest or killed by popularity and not enough 
revenue to cover the bandwidth... and in conclusion *most* spammers are 
not profitable.
