Not sure what level you're playing at but there are an awful lot of new
players in low to mid twenties, who, I won't say "don't have a clue" but
certainly need a bit of help...explain this to them, they may not even know
what a Rogue does so don't be afraid to tell them (although you may then be
bombarded with questions)
It's like, you can always tell when the healer plays a Monk or a Warrior as
well, they'll wait for you to stop binding before hitting you with a heal in
downtime.
I often move to the back of a mob, I normally spin the mob on me but that
means all the other melee get the swings on to the back. Of course if
grouped with a Rogue I'll let the rogue decide and always stand with a pet
if there is one (they don't seem to know about the BS thing ;ï¿½) )
