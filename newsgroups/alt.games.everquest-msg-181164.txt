I agree with you but Druids do it and offer more to groups.  Ports
being "lost" by POP is a minor issue at best.  Who wants to be a port
whore anyway?

I agree here also.  So what that necros are great soloers.  They are
supposed to be.

Here you are wrong.  Or lets just change every class so they do 1/10th
the damage they normally do now but have a 1/100 chance of doing a
"nuke crit".
Think they would go for that?  I doubt it.  If the "nuke crit" is the
defining attribute of the wizard (and now 2 posters have mentioned
it), then it should happened 1/5 or 6 casts instead of 1/100 casts.

> Ok. Enough. You've crossed the line into neurotic ranting here. 

I agree, lots of cheese...
