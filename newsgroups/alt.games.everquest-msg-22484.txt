Its probably one of those kneejerk reactions, like the one people
have when they see a cleric melee-ing, or heck, the one so many
people have against fear.  I can't say I've seen more than two
chanters using AOE stuns indoors anywhere, though, so like
many of the -against the grain- things I do, this looks like something
you'd see from either a good chanter or a bad one, but not the
average ones.

I'm still not clear on the benefit of the AOE stun; since there's a
chanter, we shouldn't have more than one "live" target to worry
about, the AOE component is achieving what, besides gradually
building up more hate on the mezed adds?  Sure, to lock em
all down while control is established the AOE part might be nice,
but for the purposes of chain stunning a "you can't cast that" target,
it seems sloppy.  I'd rather see the cleric with the AOE stun and
the chanter with the targetted one, frankly!
