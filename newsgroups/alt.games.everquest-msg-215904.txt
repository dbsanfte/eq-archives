The items will be Magic/Lore in thier descriptions. There are other
shovels out there so be careful.

Get a map of Najena (www.eqatlas.com). I had the most luck getting the
focus drops from the Goblin Magicians (in the area near Najena's
room). 

The dungeon requires keys for several of the doors. The first set of
keys you want is a "Guard Keyring" (drop off of Ogre Guards/Officers).
There are two traps that drop you into jail cells with locked doors.
If you can't gate you may get stuck in there (happened to my monk
heheh). You will also need keys to get to the named mobs. There are
some decent lowbie drops in the zone (flowing black robe, etc), so you
might as well do a little farming while you are there. Also a couple
of the named drop the focus items or have mgicians that spawn in thier
rooms, so it is worth getting the keys and killing them for that
reason.

The toughest mob is the Widowmistress (lilght blue to a 53). She
actually killed my 53 monk, when I wasn't paying attention. She spawns
near the giant black widows. I was farming silks and watching TV
waiting for the goblin magicians to respawn and the next thing I knew
I was in the PoK hehehe. The other notable mobs Najena, Drelzna, Bone
Cracker,  Skeleton, and Raythal were a cake walk for my Monk.. Make
sure your magic resistance is pumped up and you should be fine. The
biggest problem I had killing them was damaging myself on the damage
shields that the magicians cast on themselves and the other mobs in
the area.
