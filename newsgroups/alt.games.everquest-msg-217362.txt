I have done several without a cleric, and only one druid to replace the 
cleric.

I often am grouped without a cleric, usually with a druid instead, in a 
variety of places, including BoT, PoV inner caves.  It works quite well, 
usually preferably to have a paladin along for any needed rezzing.  A few 
nights ago, I hit BoT courtyard with just me as healer in the group and a 
paladin as the MT and backup healing.  It was probably the best xp group 
I've done to date.  Oh, no crowd control except for root in that group 
either.

I have also done several without an enchanter.  Mezzing is far from 
essential, but it is nice.  KEI or better is easily obtainable prior to 
the adventure, so no need for someone to cast it during, barring deaths.  
Worst case for me, I finish up with no KEI, I can regen my own mana 
pretty quickly anyway.  The crowd control part can be taken care of by a 
bard or necromancer instead of an enchanter, and both of those options 
also offer some mana regen ability as well.

If the mobs are living long enough for a DS to contribute significantly, 
then you are going to have a problem succeeding.  Not that a DS is not 
helpful, but, the amount it contributes to a successful mission is not 
all that high.

Well, I am biased here.  Every LDoN group I have done has had a 65 shaman 
in it.  :b

Some other buffs can have a noticable effect as well.  Ferine Avatar adds 
140 to ATK, which is nice for the DPS melee types.
