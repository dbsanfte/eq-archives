Guess this time you did it WRONG!

ok, that out of the way, IMO the death was the Shaman's fault for not being
on he ball and getting some heals off and for being AFK.  it should have
been the shaman's responsibility to either watch the chanter's health or
watch the ranger's health.   When I'm grouping my Shaman with my regular
group, I will watch either the chanter's health or the SK's health.  That
way, the cleric does not have to worry about calling for a backup heal on
someone and can concentrate on the main tank.  You can't cast 3 spells at
once, so I wouldn't wory about it.
