  The guild continues to grow, quite rapidly, in spite of a shift to the
high-end vetting standard: post application to website, get two non-
probationary sponsors, meet with officers ingame, get tagged for
30 day probationary period, ending with final guild vote. Many
of our applicants have been through this process before, coming
from mandatory raiding guilds. Our raids aren't mandatory, but
they're there for those who want the action.
  Popular farming targets for us are now BoT tower bosses and
Slavedriver Menlo in NC. Menlo routinely drops one or two
Greater Muramite Runes, necessary for upgrading the spell lines
of our leading edge people. XP farming is still mostly BoT, though
WoS is now mostly empty as the fast levellers have moved on to
MPG and RSS.

  Two incidents of note, grouping on OOW, involving clerics:
  In a WoS group, on NW - North Wall, close to tents, but not
KS'ing the tents group. Wiped once when the Girplan Guardian
was trained on us. Got one lesser named who dropped a lesser rune;
I won the roll. Our cleric quickly pleads with me to trade it; for him, the
next rune he gets will be his Symbol upgrade. After a show of reluctance,
I take pity on him, and he puts Adas on his friends list so he can pay me
later.
  Two days later he pays me. Stack of Stonewood Bow Staves, two
stacks of Stonewood Sap, some Meldstones, some Earth Mephit Skins,
and a Talisman of the Spiritseer, which I had been trying to farm for some
time now. Adas now has a better neck piece (Iron Amulet of Unseen Horrors;
no mana regen, but better +INT and +MANA). The talisman alone is worth a
rune (45k), but Rabotev can use it; grats Rab. I was able to realize 57k
from the
sale of the Stonewood stuff, putting my bank holdings over 100kpp for the
first
time. If only I could get in more rune farming groups...
  Well, I may group with him again. He thanked me most profusely.

  Second incident:
  Hooked up with a cleric in WoS just after his group broke up. Level 70,
decided to go to MPG, to Blind/Task. Familiar territory for me. We
get together a group with rogue and pally from my guild, chanter to slow,
bard to pull.
  Bard dies on the way to MPG, has to get rezzed. First pull, bard proves
to be made of paper, dies before our pally can grab aggro. Well, okay,
these are just kinks to work out; we go to work, and the mobs fall
with some difficulty - pally dosen't have a really adequate AC for these
mobs,
and 8k hp aren't much against mobs that hit for 1k. Still, the cleric
adjusts,
things seem to be working out...until Blind pops.
  Cleric reports 50m, and says "Pull". Bard says no, and I agree; we want
him
at least 80m before trying named. Cleric gets antsy, goes up toward named
and
back; says "You pull him or I will". We advise him to calm down, it's just
for a minute, we'll get him soon enough. He starts insulting us, calling
bard an
idiot. Bard says "Get back here and med. And one more insult and I'm gone."
Cleric, being group leader, dosen't wait for further disagreement; he
disbands
bard immediately. Bard backs off, but hangs around to watch us wipe.
  At this point, I am tempted to declare the cleric reckless, and leave
myself.
I give him the benefit of the doubt; he claims to group Blind/Task all the
time,
he should know how much mana he needs to take Blind. At cleric's
instruction,
pally steps up and stun-pulls Blind Hunter Rekamu, pulls him back to camp...
and the cleric is late getting off his first complete heal. Maybe late
starting the cast.
Pally goes down, I start casting Evac, chanter goes down just before it goes
off.
Also just before it goes off, I notice the cleric is out of zone, gated on
his own.
  Rogue and Adas pop at ZI. Bard tells me, "Who's the idiot now? =)"
I agree, and reply that I just had to be sure about the cleric being
reckless; I won't group with him again.

  Good clerics, bad clerics. It's nice to see someone honest and greatful.
It's not nice
to see a group member everyone depends on dismissing his group's concerns so
cavalierly. Dosen't matter so much that you know what you can do; if your
group dosen't, you have to prove youself to them, and until then, defer
to their caution. BSTS - better safe than sorry.
