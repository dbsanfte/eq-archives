Enchanters get AoE stun at level 4, they get their second AoE stun at 20,
and their third at 52 looks like.  The reason you would want Clarity is to
reduce the downtime between pulls.  You could live with enchanters at 20 so
they have two stuns to alternate between, the issue would then be resists,
you would want to keep the level of mobs that are pulled such that resists
of the stuns are low, which could mean that level 29 would be too high to
get xp.  I would guess that 29 would be a good starting point, but I don't
honestly know.
