I don't know the cost but it'll take about 400 wings & fish to trivialize
baking.  Guessing fish at 30c and wings at 20c = 50c per attempt.  50c x 400
= 20,000c = 20p.  It's boring, but out of those 400 attempts you should have
about 30 successes (whoopee :) ) and fish rolls are Banquet quality, so
lasts a nice long time.
