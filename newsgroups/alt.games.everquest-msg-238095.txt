In a pickup group the key is communication.  We always discuss how we will deal
with overpulls, etc. so that everyone will know how to respond to a given
situation.
I would have let everyone know what i was doing:  /g kiting the add til the
battle is over.
The ranger should not have switched target.  If he wanted agro he should: root
it, snare it, dot it.  Boom.  Aggro.  Did he not have ANY of those spells up?  
Has HE not grouped much?   It is my opinion that the ranger did not play HIS
character correctly.
And, IMO, IF you were getting dead the DRUID should have snared / rooted the
add since the ranger was MT / MA.  What was the druid doing?
At any rate the key here is COMMUNICATION.
