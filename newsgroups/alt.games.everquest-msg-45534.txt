Don't go to WinME - it's an abortion of an OS.  I'd be more concerned with
heat problems.  If EQ is the only serious 3D game you play, it's likely that
your CPU/gfx card is getting too hot and locking up the system.  Try playing
one night with the side of the case off and a desk fan blowing into it.  If
that solves the problem, you know what you need to do - improve ventilation.
