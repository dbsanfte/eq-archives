Just head that the new Line of Sight nerf on NPCs wasnt implemented in the
last patch....!
Verant say that it would make it too easy.

Anywayz, with only about 1 month left until NWN gets released, i doubt i'll
even care whether they fix the NPC casters or balance the MOBs. EQ is
terribly unbalanced in reference to MOBs and NPCs.
