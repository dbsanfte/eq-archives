Oh, okay, so, because they've chosen to play a multiplayer game, you
have the right to get in their face, making your requests (demands) in
the pushiest manner available? I suppose because I choose to walk out
into a bar, that gives you the right to walk up to me completely at
random and try to get me to give you a ride across town?

"Well, because they have a phone, they have volunatarily opened a line
of communication and given access to total strangers....."

Bullshit justifications. YOUR making impositions on MY time anyway.
It's MY opinion on whether your method is rude that matters, not
yours.

You can communicate without sending a direct tell. The difference
between sending a tell and using /ooc is the difference between an ad
on TV and telemarketers.

You still haven't given a reason why that has any basis outside of
"Your here to serve me because you're playing the same multiplayer
game that I am". Get the fuck over yourself.
