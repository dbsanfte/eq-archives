   I've noticed a distinct lack of communications at lower levels.  One
would think that roleplayers would be more likely to chat (I know I always
was!).  However, even purple names on AB, one of the roleplaying preferred
servers, seem to just run by without saying a word to anyone.  I think that
this might be because most people are still trying to figure out the game
and the mechanics, and can solo the earlier levels pretty easily (at least
I seem to be able to with a priest and fighter, both traditionally grouping
classes).

   I'm hoping this changes at higher levels, cause chatter is one of the
things I live for.  Preferably with lots and lots of mistells, as my
friends from EQL here can tell you.
