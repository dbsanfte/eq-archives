Aha!  That would be why I disagreed.

It doesn't take a genious to realize AMD hurt some of it's goodwill by
releasing three new sockets when for years any AMD chip would fit in the now
famous Socket A.

The difference is in how the memory is interfaced.   Intel may have elected
to release a new socket, but the reasons were not for the ram.  Since intel
uses the classic northbridge/southbridge arrangement, none of the
interfacing with the memory is handled on the chip, and hence does not
require a new platform.  A new coprocessor perhaps, but you can let the
Asian companies worry about that.

AMD's integrated memory controller confounds the situation.  If they had a
speck in Sckt 939 to allow for the DDR2 platform . . then . . . well first
it wouldn't be 939 pins (LOL) but nevermind that, then they would be
prepared to embrace the technology just by having a second memory controller
on die, which will become ever more reasonable with the next process shrink.
BUT THEY DIDN'T!

Either AMD would need to release yet another socket to support DDR2 or they
would have to let their coprocessor do it and take a huge hit in
performance.  Neither of these two options is too appealing, particularly
when DDR memory is working just fine right now.
