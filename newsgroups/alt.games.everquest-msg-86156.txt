Thanks to all that have responded to my question!

I also apologize for using the wrong term.  I should have said
Absorption Shield, rather than damage shield.  Before this, I didn't
know there was a distinction between the two.   I knew about
thorncoat and the like, but kinda forgot about them and didn't know
what they were called in general.

So in summary, uses of Rune are for
1) Casters to allow them to cast in an emergency when they are being
aggro'd.  It allows them to more often cast through attacks... fewer
interrupts.

2) On tanks for the time when Cleric is unable for any reason to cast a
big heal.

Thanks again

- Corey
