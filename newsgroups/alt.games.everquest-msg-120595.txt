Why do you need to be a prick about it? Isn't that the beauty of having an
"alt.games.everquest" to ask questions, irregardless of how silly you may
think they are? I'm sorry but your response just rubbed me the wrong way.
You are why I'm thinking about quitting this game after only a couple days
of playing. Because I'm positive you here and in game are incapable of
rendering assistance to anyone.
I've been trying like hell to figure this game out, as I'm coming from
Ultima and so used to it's way of being played that I'm confused..I ask and
ask for help and *noone* is willing to give it. And here I am in the
newsgroup and seeing the same attitude displayed. I thought EQ was supposed
to be a big happy family.

Oh well.
