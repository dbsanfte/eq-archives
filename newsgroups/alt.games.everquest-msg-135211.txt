3 or four weeks ago, a 57 necro and 60 monk in
my guild duo'd him by accident...they were aggro'd
running through, and thought "what the hell, why
not?" (FD classes are silly like that).

Necro didn't even start out with a pet, and monk had
to FD a couple of times, but Yeld couldn't regen
very well with the DoTs on him (necro ended up
having to Gate because he couldn't FD off with his
DoT going) to keep up with the monk's fungi/iksar/
aa regen, and ended up just dying while the monk
was at 40% or so.

Wonder if I could get ID to work with my rogue...
