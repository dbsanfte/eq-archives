Fish aren't skinned, they are filletted in an oven or a spit with a
filletting knife.

Take 2 spiderling silks and combine in a sewing kit to make a silk thread.

Take a Low Quality Cat/Wolf/Bear hide and combine in a tailoring kit with
the silk thread.

If you succeed, you get a Leather Padding.

You can make extra LQ hides from Medium and High quality ones by combining
them in a sewing kit with a skinning knife.
