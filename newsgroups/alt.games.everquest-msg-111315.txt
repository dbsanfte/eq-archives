In my experience it's monks.  Human monks.  It isn't safe to say the word
"mana" around them at all, because "mana" means "safe to pull."  They rarely
notice other words around it (such as "out of")...it's like they have a chat
filter and "mana" flashes green.  Around these folks when he asks how mana
is, you simply say "Do NOT pull" and hope they notice the middle word.

But I'm not ragging on them, the ones that do that to me are friends and
it's a joke more than anything else.
