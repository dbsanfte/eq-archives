That's true, but....  Even if another cleric gets a heart, they still have
to collect four pearlescent fragments, combine them, and hand them into the
Warder - which ends up spawning Ragefire.  Sure, said cleric could then gate
away without having to kill Ragefire - but if he's up, why not kill him?
Something useful might drop from the loot.

In short, the dual-heart problem wasn't truly a time-saver for anyone.

I really have to give credit to SOE for this one.  They made Ragefire pretty
much non-MQ-able and non-farmable.  You want the epic, you gotta do the
legwork yourself.
