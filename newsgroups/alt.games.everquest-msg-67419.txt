    If it turns their crank, so be it.

    They matter in their social circle, which is those same few thousand
people. The same could be said of, say, university professors in pure
mathematics. Likely will never be an application for what they do, but you
can bet they're competitive about being first.

    Skink, level 60 monk in the guild Wraith. Vis Maior, with aid from
Wraith. Vis Maior, with aid from Wraith. Vis Maior, who were the only ones
in zone for about a month. Vis Maior.

    People do care. What caused one of the biggest controversies on those
top guild websites you don't visit? When those top guilds wanted to stop
posting the stats on the loot that was dropping from Vulak. People want to
read about what's out there, and that means they want to read about the
guilds that go and do things first.

>So you have the highest level cat on your server...so?

    So he now has bragging rights on the server. Maybe it means nothing to
you, but it does to them. And if it REALLY meant nothing to you then you'd
ignore them rather than rant about it. 8)

    As an aside - on Sunday night my server (Quellious) got its first Baron
when Juzzam the Cavalier got his sixth alternate skill point and became
Baron Juzzam the Cavalier. So for those with titles, rest easy - at the very
least the first title you get won't overwrite your old title.
