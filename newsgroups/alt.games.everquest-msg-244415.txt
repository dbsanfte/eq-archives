"discs" are disciplines.  As you melee types get to 50+ levels, you can do
certain disciplines that allow you to do things like go on a backstabbing
killing spree or the like.

These disciplines are learned by purchasing (or finding) tomes that "teach"
you the discipline.  Most disciplines can be learned by purchasing tomes in
the tunnels in East Commonlands.

Check your class-specific boards for details on the disciplines you can use
and how useful they are.
