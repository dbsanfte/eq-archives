Well, the other way around:

Some levels ago, Freeport west gate, me, level 17 druid, leather armour,
staff in my hand.

Newbie monk: "Can I have some monk weapons please ?"
Me: "er .. I am no monk"
Newbie: "Who are you trying to fool ? You look like a monk"
Me: "Well, that may be, but I am a druid"
Newbie: "Doh ... but still, do you have some monk weapons?" ...........

Funny think, he didn't asked for SoW.. hehe
And yes, a druid in leather armour looks like a monk ...
