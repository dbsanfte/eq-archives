There is no loot system that is perfect for everyone in all situations.  NBG
may work fine for one guild, but not for another.

I've seen two guilds break up in part because of NBG loot.  Anyone could
roll on stuff that they could equip, but you were expected to be honorable
and only roll on stuff that was an upgrade, and that you would use.  Of
course, some people would roll on stuff that they had no intention of using. 
And others would make deals with each other.  "I'll roll on this item that
you want but I don't, and if I win I'll give it to you.  In return, you roll
on this other item and give it to me if you win", in effect giving
themselves two chances at winning.

The guild I'm in now is merit loot, awarded by the officers.  It works quite
well.  Not perfectly, but good enough for us.

DKP = Dragon Kill Points = Raid Attendance Points = Whatever They're Calling
It This Week.
