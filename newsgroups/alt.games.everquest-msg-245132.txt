> Nope, torqued off at SOE summs it up=)

I dont think that word means what you think it means. (great princess bride
quote)

Torqued means twisted or screwed(actually the force that is doing the
twisting) . I sort of understand vertically twisted (i.e. screwed up) but
torqued off is a new one for me.

Could you gimme some of the symptoms you experience while being torqued off
so i can more properly understand your usage of it?
