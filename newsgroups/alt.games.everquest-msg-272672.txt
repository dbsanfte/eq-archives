One of my friends was telling me that they were grouped with a guy who
seemed to win all the armor and scroll drops, but to be fair seemed to
loss the orc meat. He said that after they added 3 more players this
winning streak seemed to continue. Is it possible that the lotto
system was just out of wack that night or is there possibly a lotto
hack going ATM?
