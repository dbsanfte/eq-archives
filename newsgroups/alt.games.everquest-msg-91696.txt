OK, I'll spoil the whole experience for you. Here's what you'll see in
ST pre-awakening, if you're not the puller:

Nothing different until FA dies. Then 4 generic dragons warping into the
lair. If you're a healer you won't even see this as you'll be behind the
walls, hiding from the AE. Then when those dragons are dead, you can
walk in and see the 'statue' of the sleeper. Then you get to do it again
next week. And the week after, and the week after, and the week after...
Assuming, that is, that you're willing to help the 50 other people who
got you your key.

Have you seen the PoM house in nToV? The spires in Mons Letalis? The
Arena in Seru? Tunare's Tree in PoG? All these are 100 times more
interesting than seeing a half transparent inactive dragon. The *WHOLE*
thrill of seeing the sleeper sleeping is knowing that he's wakeable.

To *wake* him and set off a unique epic script. If you remove loot from
the discussion, waking the sleeper is the MOST rewarding achievement
anyone, anywhere, can ever do in EQ. Nothing else even comes close to
multi-layered epic script that unfolds.

One thing about waking the sleeper. When goes on his rampage, dozens of
people who have never been to ST, and were never likely to, get to see
the Sleeper himself, awake, shouting, fighting. That's a DAMN site more
'might and glory' than the sleeping model anticlimax at the bottom of ST

The fact that you consider ST to be in your EQ lifetime, means that you
have to be in a fairly strong guild, at least capable of taking down
first broods with any regularity, or with long term allies to help you
in that goal. Public/pickup raids for ST keys will never happen.

So your slim chance of seeing the sleeper sleeping has more merit that
me guarenteed chance of seeing the sleeper awake?

It never was. If you had been there, you'd realise that. I realise you
haven't been there, and will never see the sleeper now, but even pre-
luclin, there were more 'ultimate' goals such as nToV. With Luclin, even
an un-woken ST has dropped way down the 'goal' ladder.

It's a fair cop guv'
We went there for the loot - primarily primals and SoDs
We still go there for the loot - only primals now, but there's better
taunt weapons than SoD in Luclin anyway

Seems rather too dog-in-a-manger to me. You aren't likely to be in that
position (by your own admission) and you don't know what it'd be like
even if you were there, but still you'd like the knowledge it *is* there
in case you do ever get there, and in case it is worth the wait?

Same way I felt when I saw the Prime Healer's Bulwark probably. 'Damn!
That's cool! GRATS!', privately kicking myself I wasn't there at the
time. I certainly wouldn't chastise someone in public with some
entitlement issues. 

(ps. Though I disagree with you (and you with me) I do respect your
right to those views, and I do thank you for keeping the discussion on a
mature level. The vast majority of wake/sleep ST 'discussions' have
consisted of 'J00 SUX! U R GAY!!!' type insults)
