Might try your luck in the Gorge of King Xorbb. (Stay away from the EE's
in the center for a while yet, though.) The minos and muddites might be
a good play for you. 

Other thoughts, Highpass if you tend to group, W. Karanas or NK if
you're soloing. There's also a couple sweet spots in Ocean of Tears you
could do at sixteen nicely. I think the mermaids are just about right
for you now, and after that you could move over to the gargoyles a
couple levels later.
