I'm not going to sugar coat every thing.

You cant imagine it? Well real life can take its toll, I don't sit here 24/7
trying to get into some ubber guild, or form relations with people in ubber
guilds. I have knowledge, I like to share it. I know I cannot expand it any
more unless I level and explore more but the constant need to always be
fighting is taking my enjoyment out of the game.

I had some friends when I started out, had great ones up into the high 20s.
Then I had to leave for over a month and just, they can't always keep in
touch. I don't play on a daily basis or weekly basis, sometimes I get
preoccupied with something else. I am in no ways always seeking great money
or anything I spend a lot of my time talking with my best friend on there
(we were in KRG together, a long time ago and just stayed good friends for
some reason...) I actually role-play at the Tavern and can sometimes find it
more enjoyable then sitting there trying to camp something or repeatedly
kill the same monster. There are just a lack of things to EverQuest that can
catch my interest for a long period of time. Lack of GM events, real quest
with a good history and motive behind it, hardly any real guild...Just
little things that may or may not disagree with you. Its just my feelings.
So that's my explanation on my lack of friends.
