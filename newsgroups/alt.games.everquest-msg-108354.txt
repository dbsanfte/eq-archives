Oh puhlease.

I group WAY more post 50 as a druid than I did earlier. Its a lot more fun.
In small group environments, Druids are very useful when they are willing to
play the utility/support role, not trying to kill every friggen MOB that
gets pulled. Regen/Stat buffs are very nice when Shamans aren't around,
Skin/healing is nice when clerics aren't around. Crowd control is my
favorite when Chanters aren't around. Druids are a utility class and they
are a blast when played that way, it is very rewarding to save a group by
peeling an add and root parking it, or tracking to a lost puller and guiding
him back to the group. Adapting to the utility role IS challenging, not just
snare/root/dot/nuke all the time.

The problem for Druids is when you are in a raid anvironment, and first
string players have all buff/crowd control issues covered. And tactics are
much more rigid so that utility roleplaying is minimized. I still like
raids, I get to heal casters while the clerics focus on tanks, and I get to
toss in a DD every now and then - those little Fury of Air spells don't get
resisted often and they interrupt casters often enough to get my squishy
druid butt summoned quite frequently.

As far as the petition goes, making the high level heal (Nature's Touch)
faster casting would do it for me. As it is, Chloroblast is a better heal
and 4 or 5 levels lower. I'd prefer, though, to just let some of the Druid
group (not single target versions) spells stack with other casters. May be
considered a game breaker, but stacking Regen with Shaman (Pack Chloro or
Regrowth of Grove), or DS with Mages (Legacy line), or AC/HP buffs with
clerics (Protection line) would definitely make druids a contributor to
raids, also makes the Mass Buff AA ability worthwhile. This won't make
druids "Uber", or better soloers, and it plays along well with their support
role.

Oh yes, taking the snare component of the epic seems sensible. Making
unsnarable MOBs (like the 30th level Grimlings) immune to an epic DOT seems
silly.
