The mere fact of a market is not capitalism. There have been markets under
many forms of governments for thousands of years. There are markets under
many forms of governments now. You don't need the theoretical baggage of
capitalism to shore up the supply and demand equation.

In many ways, capitalism is a theory of how governments should treat markets
than a theory about markets. There's also a lot of stuff about the
separation of capital and labor in it.

As for the Bazaar being a "living ad for the American system of free
enterprise and
self-government", I still don't see how that claim can be made. We see
examples of market behavior like inflations and deflations, but so what? How
is that a living ad? It's even difficult to see because only the offering
price is public.

Somebody else made the argument that this is capitalism because everybody
can participate. So if suddenly Brell followers or halfling were kos in the
Bazaar, this would not be "capitalism" anymore?

The fact that it's free is not "capitalism" either. The market is
state-supported (oops, SOE-supported) so there are no fees or taxes. There
are in real life.

The Bazaar is good when there are many buyers and sellers. That's as much
theory as I need.
