Atticus, my ranger, is still currently using his Wurmslayer at level
47.  I like it, if for no other reason that I like see hits for 100
with a 1hander.  But, the time is growing near I'm afraid and I need
to start thinking about an upgrade.

Now, a Lammy would be nice but I don't want something that really hits
all THAT fast.  I just want a decent boost in damage output without
earning me enough hate that I become a ranger shaped stain somewhere.
At least no more than is absolutely necessary.

So, should I look at dropping some serious plat (that I don't have) an
a new, uber sword, or do I just make do with the Wurmy until 51 when I
get Jolt then pick up a Lamination?  Which sounds best.
