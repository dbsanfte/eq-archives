I've started a Bard (wood elf) on the Firiona Vie server. It's the first time
I've played a bard so there are few things that I don't understand.
Firstly, does the Percussion skill ever go up? I put one practice point in that
skill yet I've never seen it improve. What's more, when I use Selo's Accelerando
or the Chant of Battle it's my singing that improves and not Percussion.
Secondly, is it worth practising Piercing or should I just use 1H Slash? I guess
what I'm really asking is what is the best bard weapon going to be, 1H Slash or
Piercing?
Lastly, I made the trip to Freeport to buy supplies for Smithing and decided to
make some money on the trip by doing the mail run from Kelethin. I was told to
deliver the mail to Felisity Starbright. However, when I gave her the package
she gave me the dreaded message 'I don't know what I'd use this for...' (or
something like that). So is this quest broken?

Thanks in advance. :)
