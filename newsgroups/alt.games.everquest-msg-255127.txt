    Completely agree with that, and don't agree with the statement that its
"just mudflation".

    Content that is both doable and more importantly ACCESSABLE by a
single-group should provide gear that is noticeably not as good as
raid-gear, but not miles and miles behind.

    What really pisses me off is that there's a ton of content my usual
group could easily smack down because we are a bunch of competant and
intelligent players with a lot of experience, but we can't GET to it because
it's locked behind a raid-only flag that requires a raid force we will never
have.

    So join an uberguild? Well folks, I live in Australia, and that would
mean raiding at 9am every day. No thankyou.

    I freely accept being 12-18 months behind the uberguilds. I really do
not have a problem being two expansions behind them at every stage. I *do*
have a problem finding myself another 6 months behind them for every 12
months of play. Hell, the uberguilds probably benefit from the next 20% of
the playerbase catching up to elemental level, more than the rest of us
would. They recruit from our population, and have wasted an absolute ton of
time lately gearing up noobs.

James
