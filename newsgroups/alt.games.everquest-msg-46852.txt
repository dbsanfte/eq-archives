Sounds like you got it right.  The normal EQ view will not change in
resolution, it will just be centered.  Hit F10 once to get to full screen
display, that is the one that the resolution setting affects.  The really
stupid thing is, that in order to change the options, you have to cycle back
to the normal view first, set the new resolution, then cycle back to full
screen.
