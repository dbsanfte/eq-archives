Yes but not easily.

Hand made back packs sell for 100pp a time and can be made, consistently,
with a skill in mid 70's. Downside is that HQ bear pelts are rare as rocking
horse sh*t
This is about the best net profit you can make.
Jewellery, what you are obviously looking at, costs a fortune to get to a
decent level to make any profit from.
Smithing, Requires a huge amount of patience (and a fair amount of plat) to
make anything sellable (although banded still sells ok to chain wearers)
Baking and brewing are useful but not particularly profitable.
Fletching costs a bit to get to a decent level but you can make money from
it if you sell in the right places (take some decent stacks of arrows to the
OT and you should do ok) but, imo and experience the money you make will
only really help recoup some of what has been spent to get to that level of
the skill.

There are guides available that apparently tell you how to make 500pp in 2
or 3hrs of play. Whether or not they work I have no idea, I am a little
dubious about them and I'd rather make money trading in EC if I was to do it
without playing properly, trouble with this is you need to know the market
and being out of EC for a couple of weeks, you could end up losing out, saw
a Hammerhead helm for 4k yesterday, nearly went for it, they used to be more
like 10k but held back on it as that might have been the going rate now. As
it was it was snapped up so I prolly lost out <shrug>

I'd certainly suggest putting the effort and plat into you jewelling but
don't expect instant profit, you'll be working at a loss (as with all trade
skills) at first.
