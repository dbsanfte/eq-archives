Virtually nothing on FV is nodrop. I think Epics are about it. 
Even planar armor isn't nodrop. The magic/lore tags seem to be
as usual. However, the TLC does effect items which are nodrop 
elsewhere, with a few exceptions like low-level quest mobs in 
the planes...it's not even possible to get to them before they're 
green, after all.

So, I couldn't get the page, but I might be able to buy a ToV 
from another player if I really wanted one.
