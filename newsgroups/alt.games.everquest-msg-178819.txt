I just love this.... never did understand why a Necro only item had a
summoning focus effect.  WHOOOT!!!

Interesting.... not a shammy... but this just makes sense

Honestly I like the attempt at roleplay by the writer....

Nuther personal opinon... If the item is tiny, or very small... it
SHOULD be stackable... no ifs ands or buts about it. (well I guess
unless its a Lore item)

>- Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents.

WHOOT.... never did unerstand the need for a componet on a potion....
youd think that the master shammy would have already put that in the
potion.  Now they just need to do that to the Levitate potion.

Curious what they are implying....

do they mean they took out some safe spot exploits? or that they added
some safe spots for peeps to afk in?  heheeheh

hmmm... did he summon before?  if so ... wonder what new skill hes
got.
