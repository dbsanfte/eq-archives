Well, stun is a beneficial proc, cutting mob damage time...

I"m aware that my melee contribution is minimal.  On the

any worse than nuke and med.

I wouldn't know... but aren't there several combat tables?  I thought
various melee classes also each had their own table, seems like sheer

Casters another, or do all non-melee use the same table?
