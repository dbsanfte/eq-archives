A druid in my guild was given a Prelate's Lantern for allowing a cleric to
loot a shard.  SHe first asked to see if any of her friends and/or guildies
were online that needed it, and could get there.  None were able to, so she
ooced it, not for sale, just as being available to the first cleric that
came to get it.
