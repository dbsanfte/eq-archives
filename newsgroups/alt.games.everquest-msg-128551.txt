That's the first I've heard of this problem - MSCOREE.DLL is part of the
.NET framework so it would seem like it's not installed.. perhaps you could
try uninstalling it and then reinstalling it?  (Maybe it broke somehow).

That's the only thing I can think of.. let me know if it doesn't work, and
I'll go looking for another solution..
