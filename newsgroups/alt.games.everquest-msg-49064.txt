Simple question. Any UK , or at least Euro english speaking guilds on Ayonae
Ro. I am a gnats nuts away from dumping my level 40 druid and also my son
his level 40 ranger on this server( or maybe both going bare arsed after
paying for a transfer) , because we aren't going to get to the good stuff
unless we get in a guild. We were in a US based guild , nice guild and very
nice people ( I love the online friends I have made in the last few months),
but if I want to go < all the way> I need to get to play with people in MY
time zone.
