I have an Erudite, so can't answer this one.

Poor man's Breeze.  I keep it up al the time.  Remember to Leach just before
you kill a mob and it's basically a wash while sitting (and you get the
extra mana regen).

Used it early while tanking, dropped it around 10 or so.  Never use it now.

Use it all the time in the Undead areas.  And where do you think we get
those spell components from?  No, they are not our friends.  Besides, they
aren't dead, they're undead.

Spent 14 to 17 in Kurn's.  The trip is no problem through Warslik's as long
as your Gather Shadows doesn't drop, then you better be clear of mobs.

Standard for me is to Double DoT, send in the pet, fear, med, Leach.  Can
take Yellows and still have 1/2 plus in mana at the end of the fight and be
nearly full health.

Necro's are a hell of a lot of fun and, if played well, are great in a
group.  Just make sure the druids aren't snaring over your Darkness line of
spells (seems that they always overwrite).
