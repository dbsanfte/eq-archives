Also, folks need to differentiate between critters
that see through invisibility spells/camo, and mobs
that actually can See Invisible.

I can sit next to a ravishing drolvarg while sneak/
hiding to make silk swatches.  On the other hand
a waaaay green Urd Ghoul Wizard may nuke me
as soon as I step out of the water in the Bedroom
on L. Guk's deadside.

In Dreadlands, that translates as "many things in
DL see through spell-invis, but only certain spiders
that have actively cast 'See Invisible' on themselves
will see a rogue sneak/hiding."
