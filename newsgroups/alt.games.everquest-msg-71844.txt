Ah, then you're just talking about uberraids, not everyday unless you're in
an uberguild.  Ok, fair enough.

Thankfully the percentage of 50+ in an uberguild (and happy about it) is a
pretty small percentage.  There's a hell of a lot more to do than uberraids
when you're 50+.  If uberraids are the only thing that makes you happy you
should probably quit if you don't get your monk to 60 fast since you'll
never be happy.

Only you can make you happy.
