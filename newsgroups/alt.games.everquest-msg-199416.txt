Funny how many times I've heard that same drone.   Fennin Ro, Amtoos...
look me up if you care to.  Hang around a while and watch what a Barbarian
Rogue tweeked almost to the gills can do with a 56 (almost 57) Shammy by his
side and then weep that you didn't decide to start a Barbarian Shaman and
Rogue way back when.  Yea, I play 2 boxes and my wife has an account and a
56 Druid as her main so actually we have 3 boxes and 3 accounts...  I'm
seriously considering having another machine built if I can get my 53 Wiz
transfered from account number 3 to a new account number 4... I'm think if I
call sony and assure them I'll open another account thats paid yearly they
might just oblige me but who knows what sony will or won't do?   No, we're
not addicted to EQ.  We have a life.. we just can't remember where we left
it 2 years ago!

Really!  Hmmm... seems odd in that I've played with a guildie's Pally in PoI
no less, who had just about 3200 HP's and AC right at 977 buffed and she did
pretty damn well.  In probably 8 to 9 hours of playing with her Pally in PoI
and PoN she only died once and she was only 53 when I first played with her!

Oh man how I often wish I could crawl through the computer screen... yea I
have a temper but at least I admit it.  Only reason I'm not foaming at the
mouth right this minute is the :) at the end of that last statement.   Heres
a little more Rogue info for you to chew on...  Right now, at 47 and with
the same 2 swords (yea one hand slashing.. I know, Rogues are suppose to
backstab but I didn't make a Rogue I only used the class because of what I
know I could do with gear on top of his second only to an Orge Str, Sta and
Agi stats... Trolls are a tad better stat wise but why would anyone play
such an ugly looking toon...  but people play Orges and not only are they
ugly, but fat and dumb looking too! LOL :)....)  he hits max for 63 dmg with
a 24 dmg sword in the right hand and up to 38 with a 14 dmg sword in the
left hand and both have delays under 22 but consider he always has haste and
mobs are slowed too.   Also consider that at conception and he got 5 more
bonus points than a Barbarian Warrior so being able to equip him anyway I
wanted I opted to created and build his skills as a semi-warrior.. No, he'll
never be the tank a Barbarian Warrior or especially an Orge warrior is but
playing with a 57 Shammy, 56 Druid and 59 Claric he dosn't have to be!  To
be truthful if Orges weren't KOS in most places I'd have made an Orge
something instead but Barbarians are great melee's.  My RL friend from work
how began playing EQ only a month or so after its release has a 55 human
Warrior he first started day one on EQ.  He's ofcourse upgraded gear and
weopons and his warrior is moderatly well tweeked out today.  While in OOT,
at level 43, he brought his 55 Warrior (with around 3400 HP's and about 926
AC) over and I slowed a dark blue to my Rogue and a lt blue to his warrrior
seafury and they squared off on the two mobs.  He killed his about 45
seconds faster and took just a bit shy of 3 bubbles of dmg while my Rogue
took just slightly less than 4 bubbles of dmg... and he was 12 levels
higher, now it wouldn't even be a match, I'd waste him!  When I put my right
hand sword in Rogues left hand and buy the 28 dmg/22 delay sword I'll be
getting as soon as I or my wife see one in Bazaar he'll max hit right handed
around 76 to 78 and 48 to 49 or more left handed and hasted he hits so fast
and often spiders in DL rarely landed a cast on him.. usually one in three
managed to poision or root him once during a fight.

Even now in KC with my original swords he kills white con's (between dk blue
and yellow con's) in 3 min. with my Shammy casting only one 1720 posion DOT.
I don't have to cast Chloroblast (450 HP heal) more than 3 times tops and
usually only twice to yellow con'd mobs.  In the 7 or so hours in KC to
date, no deaths (only one death total while wife was playing him at 37 in
OOT and she simply sacrficed him to save my Shammy) and only 2 hasty
retreats out.  I've seen at least a dozen "tanks" die since I started taking
him there and most are 48 or higher... remember I took him there the first
time at only 44 and he survived without any really close calls.

Now he does have a big down side that could be a problem it I didn't have a
second box with my Shammy on and that is he uses his yellow Staminia bar up
usually after doing only 60 to 70% dmg on dk. blue mobs...  the haste really
makes him use Staminia fast but both my wifes Druid and my Shammy can
Invigor him with very little mana useage.  I beleive the Stamina drain is
because I'm hasting him 50% with a level 55 Shammy haste (think I got it at
55 but I bought a lot of spells many levels ahead of time too).  His Sta
stat with my 56 buff is now 210 which isn't too bad.  After I do the two
peices of gear upgrade it should be closer to 220 or a bit more, which
pretty much rocks and will boost his HP's but I don't really yet know by how
many... 10 Sta plus the 55 HP's on the gear upgreade could take him closer
to 2300 HP's with Shammy buffs and over 3200 with Claric buffs.

Yes, it is....  your absolutly correct.  I have a bad habit of typing very
fast and not paying attention to spellling and spellling was never my strong
suit to begin with.  In College I double majored in Biology and Pre-Law
(unique combination.. hehehe) and ended up going to Grad school for Cellular
Biology because of my rather poor spelling.  The Law Schools pretty much
frowned on poor spelling while the Grad Schools of Science focused on
overall Intelligence rather than a simple rote skill...  I work for the
Government in Law Enforcement and never pass up an oppertuinity to make the
observation that with the advent of spell checkers I have over come my
inharent cognitive flaw but intil programers prefect artifical intellegence
they'll just have to struggle on with theirs...the vast majority of my
fellow co-workers are Law School Graduates or Bar Exam successors...
hehehehe

Well Martin, if you have indeed succeded in leveling 3 characters to 65 my
hats off to you.  I seriously doubt I'll ever get past 59 or 60 at best and
I have zero trade skills on all my alts!  Why not make a Barbarian Shaman
and create him as you would a warrior since Wis and mana gear is pretty
abuntent and not too awfully expensive.  I wish I had done that but I bought
the dogma of putting most of my bonus points into Intelligence.  If I had it
to do over I'd have only put maybe 7 or 8 tops into Intell and the rest into
Sta and I'd have a lot tougher Shaman right now.  12 or so bonus points at
the start into Sta and hell he'd have probably 200 to maybe 300 more HP's
and 20 or 30 more AC with the same gear I have.

Good hunting
