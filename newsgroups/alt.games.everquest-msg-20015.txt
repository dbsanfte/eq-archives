I am in the same boat as you.  I spend what little I have on Cleric Spells and
armor.  

I tried Jewelry making, but unless you can get your metal enchanted, it is
useless.  I was thinking of taking up tailoring. I have been told that can make
some money.  But it seems to me that the guys that are making money are making
banded armor--what is that?  Smithing?  

good luck and if you find a way to make money let me know, ok?
