I didn't post it because it had cussing in it.  I personally very rarely 
cuss.  I can't recall the last time I got really profane.  I just 
thought it was funny.  Now, profanity just for the sake of it makes my 
head hurt and I don't think it is funny ie: the LoS site.  I don't 
usually post OT stuff but the 10 commandments thing was so funny I had 
to share it. I didn't write it, don't know where it came from, and won't 
even try to take the credit for it.  If you can't understand humor, then 
I feel very sorry for you.  You don't get my sig file either do you?
