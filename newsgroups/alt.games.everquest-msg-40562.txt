Level 5 is when decay time increases, I know, I "tested" it, my level 5
wizard had died in Qeynos hills, and I had to go out right after, before I
could get my corpse, I had fairly given up on the crap on my corpse, but I
logged back in about 8 RL hours later, ran to QH, typed /cor and found that
my corpse hadn't decayed yet.
