No, but the point is basically that pets will use their intrinsic
damage or the weapon's damage, whichever is higher.  However, they
will use the procs on those weapons regardless.  This is why the Mage
summoned weapons are useful to give to our pets...the procs add up
over time even if the melee damage doesn't change.

Game on,
