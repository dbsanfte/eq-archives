Yeah but once you reach 60 the places you can hunt, and what you can hunt get
more and more limited. When you are low 50's there are tons of places to go
and adventure.

Why does everyone race in this game? What difference does it make?
Who cares as long as you are having fun? The journey is the thing in RPGs
not the destination. I see so many people in the game and my guild hit 60
or get their epics and then they either quit the game, or start playing their
other characters more. They get burned out just dancing on the leveling treadmill.

I just don't get the poeple that do the oasis-highpass-overthere-loio-dreadlands-kc-
velks-60 thing. From one grind spot to another doing the same mobs for days or
weeks on end. I get bored of a hunt spot in about 3 hours, then I have to go do
something else. This game is so huge and people limit themselves to such
a small percentage of it.

I got run3 regen3 and first-aid3 on my monk at 51 and it has made a HUGE
difference to my downtime. Makes hunting much more enjoyable to me.
