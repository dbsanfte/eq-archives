Seems like a decent box, had usb2 ports up front I think the box was $800. The Alienware was a P4 2ghz box for $999 with about the same specs for everything else. I remember in the back of my mind that someone once told me AW boxes are easily upgradable, is that the case? Is it worth the extra $200 for the "slower" box and will this handle most gaming?

I don't know much about Alienware, but I wouldn't buy an HP if you put
a gun to my head :-P I have never seen a truly "upgradeable HP (or
compaq, or Dell, or Gateway).
