I don't know about this....Seems like people are just used to blaming
Microsoft....Verant chose the API to use and the version of the
API....Microsoft just makes it and puts it into the world...So isn't blaming
Microsoft like blaming a gun manufacturer for killing people??? And of
course Microsoft will eventually drop win95 support, they're not in the
business to lose money....
