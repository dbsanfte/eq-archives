Please make sure you're more careful about spelling certain words.

Rouge means "red" in French, or another word for the make-up called "blush."
Riverdale is out of Archies comics, I think.

"Rogue" is your class, and your home city is "Rivervale."

In answer to your question, MOST of the time if you say "what about [the
words in brackets]" it will work.   Example,

NPC: Are you willing to [fight for the cause]?
You:  What about fight for the cause?

This is true for the very old quests (the vast majority of them).  Many new
quests don't have brackets, but I think those are mostly aimed at higher
level folks accustomed to dealing with Verant's quest writers and can
generally figure out what it is they're looking for us to say.
