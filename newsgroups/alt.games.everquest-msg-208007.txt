First, just to be 100% clear, "mob" = NPC.
"Mob positioning" refers to exactly what it says:  getting a mob
you are fighting into the specific spot you want it.  This can be
important when you are fighting in close quarters, or when you are
near other mobs that might add into the fight, or are near some
bothersome terrain (a drop-off or water you don't want the mob
pushed into, for instance).  For a Druid, you usually don't have
difficulty unless you are root parking (using a root spell as a
form of crowd control, immobilizing a mob in a place it cannot
attack you or your group) in close quarters.  If you don't have
some other more suitable class to do this chore (Paladin is often
a good choice, Ranger isn't bad, Clerics are good for it but are
usually too concerned with being main healer, Shaman likewise are
often busy with other responsibilities) you should be ready to
step in.  In fact, being ready to step in and cover the gaps in
a group's strengths is what Druids often end up doing in a group.
You'd think that in a group with a Shaman and a Cleric a Druid
would be of little use, but I pulled my weight just fine in Nadox
last night.
