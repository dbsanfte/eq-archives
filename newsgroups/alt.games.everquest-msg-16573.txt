It is true.

I view it from the opposite side:  How would that matter?

If I were a guild leader, it wouldn't make any difference to me if
person X had "left the guild" but still played the game, or if
person X simply wasn't playing the game any more (but still technically
had characters "in" the guild).

Either way, they're not going to be showing up for any more guild
activities.

The only "guild member list" that really matters is already in
the game (and can be used by both guild members and guild leaders):

    /who all GUILD       <- The "GUILD" *must* be capitalized

This shows you a list of which members of the guild are
actually playing "right now".

To me, the issue of which people have technically "left" the
guild is irrelevant, since it doesn't tell you anything
terribly useful.

"Joe officially disbanded from the guild" is such a tiny
subset of the MIA (Missing in Action) guildmembers that
pinning it down wouldn't help you much, you'd still have
nothing to help you sort out:

1.  People who didn't disband, but aren't playing any
more anyway.

2.  People who didn't disband, but are playing alternate
characters which aren't in the guild.

3.  People who didn't disband, but play at strange hours
when the main body of the guild isn't playing.

Etc., etc.

The distinctions (including "Joe disbanded, but still
plays in another guild") are irrelevant.  Joe is either
there when you need him, or he's not.  He's either a
big participant in guild activities, or he's not.  And
"/who all GUILD" will tell you if he's around, or not.
And if he's not, does it really matter why?

People in EQ come and go.  I'm not sure there's
any point in having more precise ways to track them.
