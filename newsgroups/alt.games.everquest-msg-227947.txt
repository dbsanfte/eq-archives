    One of the monks in my guild got the dev involved with this, Rytan,
drunk at the last Fan Faire, so maybe I can shed some light on this. ;-)
Rytan is a monk player, BTW.

    The idea is to give monks back the role that they always had, that of
puller. Ask most high-level monks why they made a monk, and the answer is
"to pull". But with Fading Memories, a bard can, in most circumstances, pull
better than a monk *and do many other crucial jobs*. So to bring the classes
back into balance, and to give monks a role again, you can either nerf bards
or enhance monks. The route they chose was to enhance monks.

    Monks now act like super-bards, at least when it comes to pulling. They
have a new melee ability to run at near-Selo's speed for a short while. They
can lull. They have far better tanking options during the pull (rear arc
avoidance), and once they get to camp (Stonestance, the new improved version
of Stonestance). Instead of being limited to one full mem blur every minute
or two, they can feign quite frequently, and even use the properties of
feign to further manipulate mobs if their AI/pathing allows it. About the
only bard pulling trick they don't have access to is Highsun, and that game
mechanic is so broken anyways I can't imagine anyone getting it.

    Not so sure about that, unless you're doing stuff so trivial to pull
that and cc that it doesn't matter who pulls. A monk puller will be as good
as any lull class at splitting, can feign off any unexpected overpull, and
doesn't use resources (mana) needed for other applications. Some of the new
changes have very questionable value, or are negative impact (Evasive timer
nerfed), but this one was spot-on. Monks didn't need DPS, they needed their
old role back.

    A lot of the ideas I saw from people either didn't give monks a unique
role, or didn't create a useful role. What was your fix, BTW?
