   Level 1, untwinked warrior from Halas to Kael Drakkel.  Died 3 
times, all before I reached Blackburrow.  No ports, only 3 unasked-
for SoWs (admittedly, I didn't click them off).  Fell into a crevasse
in the ice in I think the Great Divide, had to be summomed from it
by a guide.  Didn't get very far into Kael Drakkel at all.  
   Very pointless, very stupid, and more than a little fun.
