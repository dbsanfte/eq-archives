Aha, but the guy stuck in the lot may have been there for 10 minutes, 
and might be stuck there another 10 minutes.  The act of letting him out 
might take what, 20 seconds?  Multiply that 20 seconds by the 10 people 
and you get 200 seconds... yet for the guy in the lot, 6000 seconds were 
saved.

Even this isn't a fair assessment, because 6000 seconds to one person is 
quite different from 20 seconds to each of the delayed people.  The 
delayed people can eat that time in standard deviations in travel speed, 
while the 6000 seconds simply isn't something you can shrug off.

AND someone is doubtless going to let that guy out of the lot 
eventually, so some set of 10 people are going to be inconvenienced by 
20 seconds.  The longer it takes for that to happen, though, the higher 
the guy in the lot's wait time becomes (in my example, its already 6000 
seconds and might be 6000 more); letting him in when you see him cuts 
his additional time served to zero while having NO net effect on the 
random people in the line, because while the ones directly behind you do 
get a slight delay, some other set of 10 random people did not get a 
slight delay that they otherwise would, when some other person lets him in.

The two terms seem two parts of a reflexive verb to me:  I'm a realist, 
you're utilitarian, he's a rude bastard.

Yep, makes these questions interesting doesn't it?  Perhaps someone will 
eventually publish an ethical calculus, till then we'll have to struggle 
along on an algeabra of rightly ordered loves and a frission of modal logic.
