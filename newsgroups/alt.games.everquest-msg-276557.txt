That'd be you, not the class.   My druid solo'd orange solo
mobs in the high teens.  Did through the 20s, too.  Doesn't
have a problem with the same in the 30s yet either.   Group
mobs were/are doable blue in most cases.

It's very important to upgrade your spells but that's about
it.   And avoiding group mobs with a lot of mobs (which
have a high damage peak output early on.)   Those
crowds of antelopes in TS were a big PITA...

> Much more fun as group

That would depend on your definition of fun, of course...
