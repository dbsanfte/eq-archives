Sums up my feeling about the Discord server pretty well. I enjoyed it too, 
but never got past level 8 at the highest. And not just because I was bested 
in PvP; a couple of the the deaths were due to out-and-out exploits. Since 
there were no GMs on the server and the policy was basically "you're on your 
own", there wasn't anything stopping the exploiters from throwing their 
worst at you.
