    Several other class sites have hunting guides. The one that really
sticks out in my mind is the one at Graffe's.

    Hunting guides vary wildly, and for good reason. Most hunting guides are
written with a very specific target audience in mind, one whose capabilities
are well-known. The wizard one on Graffe's, for example, is geared towards
the solo wizard. What is good XP for a solo wizard likely won't be good XP
for a monk, or a group of six, and could outright kill a magician. You may
want to think ahead of time exactly who the target audience is for the
guide, and then solicit submissions.

    If anything I've ever posted is of any use, you are more than free to
use it.

    Not a good idea. Bandwidth costs can go through the roof if you post
something useful. Just ask one of the other guilds on our server, Vis Maior.
They once had a loot guide for NToV stuff that was the best out there. So
every guild in the world linked to it, and Vis got slapped with a big bill
to keep the site afloat. This can even be an issue with EZBoards, if you
want to avoid pop-up ads.
