"Showin' your ignorance again, Morgan."

Every review of DAoC  has been quite favorable.  Posts on DAoC
beta-boards are clearly stacked in favor of DAoC being a FAR
superior game to EQ with only minimal problems (to be expected
in a beta-test) which would be fixed in short order.  EQ isn't a bad
game except that it's a no-holds-barred, hack-n-slash level-quest 
of a game with no real substance beyond level 20 (and, yes, I do
have characters beyond 20 on both of my cancelled accounts--
I have an L56 Erudite Wizard and a L52 Halfling Druid as well
as a collection of sub-40s characters that pretty much cover
the spectrum of characters that EQ offers).  Let's face it, PvP
is a joke in EQ, even on the Zek servers, trade skills are a joke,
most quests are nothing more than NPC guided hack-n-slash,
fuck-it-didn't-drop, wait, hack-n-slash some more.  Above all,
Verant takes this game and themselves WAAAAYY too 
seriously.  Well, I did have some fun in the past 3 years (I say
3 years because I was in the beta) and Verant got plenty of
my money--now it's time to trade up.  See you all (well, not
all of you, just the smart ones) in DAoC.
