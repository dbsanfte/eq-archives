It doesn't say 'be happy about the tragedy', it says 'be happy that the 
tragedy has a silver lining'.  And I think he's right.

One thing I've noticed is that 'working to prevent similar tragedies' is a 
very American pastime.  America seems to feel that everywhere you go there 
should be big yellow-and-blak signs that say 'don't be a moron!', eg, 
'Don't touch the electric third rail', 'Do not attempt to drink this can 
of industral solvent', 'Don't use this hammer for pounding nails through 
your head'.  And I think it's bloody foolish.  You go to France, for 
example, and walk around for a week, and you'll notice that you can 
actually see the nifty houses and streets and whatnot because there aren't 
big signs saying 'don't'.  We put tons of man-hours into worrying about 
making every little thing in America so safe even a complete idiot can't 
get hurt by it and then somehow, we're suprised when the next generation 
pops out even bigger idiots who figure out a way to require a new sign.

Personally, I think the one dolt (of whatever age) saved by those tons of 
man-hours was a bad investment.

Another issue:  kids are an innately curious bunch.  Have you ever noticed 
how warning signs and signs that say 'NO!' seem to taunt kids wth wanting 
to know 'what would happen if I -did-, then?' Clearly the way to fix this 
is to pass legislation requiring every warning sign to have a warning sign 
stuck on it saying 'And we mean it!  Go to your room!'

Remember back when toys used to be wooden or tin?  I loved those toys, but 
you won't see them around as much anymore.  God forbid Junior should get a 
splinter!  Oh no! The toy may rust, and break, and leave a sharp edge! So 
much emphasis is put on toy safety, that at some point, in my opinion, the 
quality of the toy suffers severely.  So we end up with un-fun 
non-educational toys that at least cannot be nasally inserted.  Joy.  To 
use the OP's example, pulling that strangulatory string was (a) more fun, 
and (b) good preparation for the teen years when I make the rugrat go 
start the lawnmower for me.

When I reproduce, my child is going to have decent not-safe toys if I have 
to carve them myself.

There's another point of view for ya:  By having a not-safe toy, the kid 
managed to learn life's harsh little lesson in a way that didn't impact 
others.  I can just imagine the results if he'd been allowed to grow up 
and get his hands on a lawnmower.  Yipe.  But no, let's keep all the kids 
perfectly safe and in a consequence-free plastic bubble life until they're 
at least old enough to get a driver's permit and take two or three folks 
wth them.
