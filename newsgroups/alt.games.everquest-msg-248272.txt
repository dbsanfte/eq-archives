The new games have been more solo-friendly. If the game is soloable then 
no class brings a required capability to a group. Because grouping 
itself isn't strictly necessessary.

Adding people just invariably 'makes it easier, not 'makes it possible'. 
In an environment like that group composition is pretty irrelevant... 
sure an ideal group would be more effective... but anything is adequate.
