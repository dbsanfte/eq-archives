Nothing prevents an EQ wizard from picking up a weapon, either,
other than the fact that casters are on the worst attack table in the
game, and have the lowest skill caps.  I see this as directly comperable
to the D&D version of things... probably because so much of EQ was
visibly designed by people who grew up playing D&D.

An EQ wizard can wear chainmail, if he really wants to, and kit out with
HP and STA gear, there's little to stop him having HP and AC along
the lines of a poorly equipped ranger if he wants to.  Crossbows... well
don't get me started there, its been promised for well over a year.  I don't,
though, recall bows being on the learnable skills lists of D&D or AD&D
edition 1 or 2 unless they were multiclassed; throwing weapons, yes,
but not archery ones.  Edition 3 I'm not so familiar with, seemed more
flexible.  At any rate, EQ wizards could certainly take up throwing, its
simply one of the worst attack skills in the game, almost entirely relegated
to pulling for classes that can't use a bow and don't have a better ranged
pull method available (monks, in other words)
