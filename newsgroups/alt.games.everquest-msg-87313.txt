i find myself baffled as to the reason why verant dont bother to update
their server status and downtime pages??
this would save so many headaches in the chat rooms with people askin for an
eta etc
why the f**k cant they just bother to spend the couple of minutes it takes
to update their pages, i would think that would be just showing their payin
customers common courtesy rather than let them go through the rigmorol of
gettin to the login screen only to either get the cant log in msg or gettin
booted from char screen

of course i may be wrong, i may be lookin at the wrong eq site but i dont
think so!!
