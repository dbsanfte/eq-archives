To begin with, I have no answers for the original poster. This is merely a
post about something that the original poster kick-started in my head.

That said... I belong to a guild, having joined something like a year ago.
I'm not even sure -why- I joined, since the main purpose of guilds seems to
be grouping, social interaction, backup, etc. I -never- group. The only time
I ever did was with an ex boyfriend who had some high level characters and
gave me a -lot- of help *and* stuff. Even then... well, I guess 2 doesn't
make a group, exactly. I used to watch him sometimes while he was grouped
with members of his guild, when they went into dungeons, and I learned quite
a bit just from watching. He was a very good group leader, and that's gotta
be a hard thing -- to coordinate that kind of thing and be 'responsible', to
say when to evac and know when not to, being the main puller (he was a Troll
Warrior), giving the lesser informed members lessons in "how to group"...
It's not something that I, personally, would want to do. The very thought of
that kind of responsibility makes me shudder. And maybe that's one of the
major reasons that I don't group. I was so accustommed to grouping with my
ex that I was worried, afterwards, about how well I would do, grouping with
people I don't really know. I'd take it very personally if something *I* did
got someone killed.

I said all that to ask a couple of probably stupid questions -- #1) how do
people find good groups? #2) And when you do, how do you learn how to "play
well with others"? (good title, btw!) Is it mostly a matter of just trying
people out? #3) And is it -worth- it, so far as experience and cash goes? I
don't know much about that part, mostly because my just characters killed
stuff and his stood around healing them or otherwise helping out. (though
sometimes he'd drag out his pally just so we could group) I know it's taken
me a long time to get to almost 18, on my own (mostly because of an error on
my part in tactics, though I've remedied that now), but I haven't had much
trouble with cashflow. Those GLightstones sell for around 3 pp, I think, and
the regular ones are about 8g, and I killed wisps for something like 3
weeks. I guess I was wondering more about the experience than anything else.
Is there a formula you can use to know how much the members will typically
get, depending on what they kill? Or is it just a given that if you're
grouped, because of several factors, i.e the ability to kill stuff faster,
you -will- get more exp? And I'd appreciate it if people could tell me
why -they- group. I know that there are lots and lots of mobs that one
single person just can't take out, so that's a pretty obvious reason. I was
mostly wondering if there were other reasons.


Great thread, btw, I've learned a LOT here.

Thanks in advance,
Darklet druid of almost 18 seasons

Thanks for playing.
