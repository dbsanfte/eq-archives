Putting together a team of Necros, Level 51 & 54.  I am looking for hunting
spot suggestions.  It seems to me that fear kitting will be the most
efficient.  49 pet tank + rogue pet stabbing way = lotta damage.  Throw in
DOTs that stack very well and we should have the ability to take on most
things.  I don't want to rule out root / rot, just looking for the best
place to grind out some levels.

Thanks in Advance
Xanisx, 51st Iksar Necro
