No, I think not :) (not a particularly good thing for a druid, I mean) I've
actually never been to that ring... personally, I was just astounded that
people killed the druids (I know... why? dunno, just seemed to boggle my
mind, perhaps because I am not old enough to kill much of anything, so far
as npc's are concerned) I just didn't realize that people did it. Thanks for
the heads-up about healing/buffing people close to the ring. I assume that
ONE day I'll be old enough to actually go there! ;) and I WILL remember your
advice!
