Was sitting in East Wastes at the orc fort. Partnered with an enchanter who
was afk at the time. A nameless druid (red to me at the time, so 55+) with
his Epic drags Chief Ry`gorr out of the fort, and runs over the hill towards
the dwarf camp. I notice the druid's at a sliver of health. Unsnared Chief
runs up to my enchanter partner and pummels him into the ground before I can
get a heal off. I kill the Chief (who was at full health) and the druid goes
BALLISTIC on me. He even complained to my guild leader, who basically
laughed at him after hearing both sides of the story.

He didn't even bother to pay for the rez for the enchanter.

Did I mention he's in one of the upper guilds in the server?
