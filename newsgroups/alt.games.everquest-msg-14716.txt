If *all* you do is try to powerlevel yourself as fast as you can, it can
eventually turn into more of a "job" than a game.  One of the prime reasons I
started my warror was with the goal in mind of getting to fifty as
efficiently as possible.  However, having made it a fair percentage of the
way there (37) I find myself more and more often taking side trips to see
other zones, camp things for items for friends/alts that I wasn't able to get
before, even if it's slow/no xp, and things like that. I still want to get
through each level and wind up going to a zone where I can grind out some
yellow bubbles after a while, but it's not as much of a desperate rush
anymore.
(But I still want to go to the plains and kill a dragon someday, so I push
on. <grin>)
