The "camping the spawn" policy of EQ was laid out some 2 years ago.  Before
then it was not uncommon for a group or a single person to camp and area for
DAYS.  I am serious.  An example on my server was the aviaks at arena
entrance in Lake Rathetear.  Most often one person would sit there all day
going afk for meals and if anyone tried to take any of the spawns would be
screaming to the GM's about KS'ing the spawn.  So Varent initiated the "Play
Nice Policy" where you could not claim a camp or area for an extended amount
of time.  Bottom line, everyone is supposed to share camps.  Verant had a
news release about this very fact.  If you set up a camp where someone else
may also want to camp you have to share.  If you do not share that camp the
other group/person can petition a GM about it.

PS.  I have recently seen a resurgence in the old style of camping in the
bandit camps in palaudial caverns.  Where one group will sit in the middle
of the camp and have everyone in the group pull all they can back to the
middle of the camp thus taking over the entire bandit camp.  I have already
heard of people petitioning the GM that these groups are not "sharing".  I
expect to see SONY to pull out the big nerf bat soon on this zone.
