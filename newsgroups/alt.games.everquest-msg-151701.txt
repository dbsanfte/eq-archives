Ya thats the right name.  A few guildies have it.. and whilst I wouldn't say
it enables them to "melee" (miss.. miss.. hit for 20.. miss.. miss.. hit for
40..)..

A guildie mage did 22k damage on the Thought Horror Overfiend (a named in
The Deep) with melee though (400 or so with "crushes" and 21.6k with the
silent star proc heh)
