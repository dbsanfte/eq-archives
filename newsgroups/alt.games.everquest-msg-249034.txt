Believe it or not.. most people who play this game up through the
levels for the first time land in one. The problem with family guilds,
especially at those levels, is that they get centered around content.
As such.. if you want to advance in the game.. there is rarely a way
you can stay in one. You finish levelling to 65.. want to raid some
interesting areas.. but can't. And the family guild hits what it can..
but as its players get gear.. they look to leave because they don't
want to farm that area endlessly. And as they leave.. the family guild
is forced to re-equip with new members coming in. Its an endless cycle
that tends to keep these family guilds around for a long time, and
people usually point and go.. that was my first guild.. but really the
advancement is just not there until more expansions give newer areas
for them to center around giving better gear.

Personally.. lack of appeal? Some of my most cherished moments in the
game were raiding in a family guild in 50's. And this was after PoP
had hit. My very first raid was a 10 hour raid in Hate with 50's
members. I still remember going to the 24 hour mexican place at 3am
for 'dinner' because we couldn't just stop the raid and I didn't have
food in the apartment at the time to eat.

You have it easy because the xp grind has been pretty streamlined. I
would suggest looking to create your own groups.

I really don't think you'll have much success unless you can sell
stuff from time to time. I used to leave trader up during the night
while I slept, but I realize some people can't do that.

I see no reason you can't be elementally flagged if you have the will
to do so. It may have changed since I was on.. but it was just a
matter of finding when the mob you want was last up, figure out when
it will be up again.. and on the day its due watch for the inevitable
open raid forming to go hit it. If you go along on a couple and meet
some people you'll find they're often loose affiliations that if you
join you can go along on something announced when you have he time
without being expected at every raid. Slowly but surely you'll get
there. The only problem child left is RZTW(Rallos Zek The Warlord)..
and that isn't that hard to get anymore.

But you are going to have a hard time doing it at 54.. you need to be
60+, have the spells that go with it, and learn cleric raiding
tactics.

At 54? Not much.. most of what you stated is quite important at 65.

Not true.. allthough some people would like it to be that way. With
your 1HB.. you get hammer spells that cast a hammer that has a nuke as
a proc. If my cleric was snoozing on an ldon easy due to decreased
healing needs i'd have them use it for extra dps or go straight nuke.
You get better nukes post-60.

Keep the group alive while adding as much dps as you can without
compromising keeping the group alive.

>I could start another char, but what do I do in the 50s more PoJ etc.

Once you can get to 55 you get access to the tier 2 planes. You can
then do Valor for much better experience.

I did all of 59 in PoI factory when a yellow took 3 hours of good
chain pulling. And that was considered 'great' experience. 59 was hell
on earth to get through.

Well.. as I said.. nearly every single one of those PL'in uber guild
fools were where you are at now. They faced the same problems you
did.. the same issues you have.. and when they did it was certainly a
much harder problem and hump to get over than it is now. But would I
want you going to SOE to talk about the content of new expansions and
the problems of the current one when you are just in the process of
getting over the first big hurdle the game offers new players? Sorry..
the answer is no. There is so much mind-boggling stuff you don't know
yet. I do hope you stick through it.. it can be quite fun.

GoD/OoW issues have *0*, and I repeat *0* to do with sub level 55
players. The expansions were not built for you nor were they in any
way, shape, or form intended for you. You had LDoN for that and
getting groups for there should not only be a good way of getting
through the 50's, but provide you decent plat while doing so.

>Can any one say dx9 and new graphics engine!

This was a horse of a different color. And I can't comment on it since
i've taken a bit of hiatus from the game.

... or i wouldn't be here :>.
