Nuke and nuke quickly,

Get all the Wizards, Druids and Mages you can muster and burn burn overburn.

Before you start you need to have a bard kite her so she uses up here mana.
You need couple of chanters to mana drain to stop her from healing.

High MR resists and cold resists.

Start by putting all pets from pet classes on the spot you are going to pull
to. When bard pulls her in have the MA engage just after he uses a potion to
root himself to stop the fear. Have pets engage, debuff MR and Fire resists
and then Nuke nuke nuke. All other melees should also engage at this point.
If Gore not dead after 15 seconds expect a wipeout. The AE fear is very hard
to resist and from experience anyone under lvl 59 will be feared a lot. make
sure you don't have a sow else you will be miles away.

The biggest problem is the AE fear. The AE cold roar is the second issue and
will wipe casters.
