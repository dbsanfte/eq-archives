Since I seem to be the first and, to date, only person to respond on
this subject, I must say that it's not a very big bandwagon. Oh, and
if you think that was a flame, I'd like to welcome you to Usenet,
since you obviously just got here.

No. I did not jump on the bandwagon. Nor did I flame you. I commented
because I have found that there is a contingent that wants EQ to be
unnecesarily hard and it tends to be the same ones who think that
hours of spamming WTS macros were more in the true spirit of EQ than
the bazaar who also think that getting yourself and your corpse lost
are game enhancements.
