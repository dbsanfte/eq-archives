Tunnel goes past/through the Necro guild, you won't make it without
invis (which works just as well to get you there aboveground).

Invis does it.  Either buy a few potions, or if that's too expensive

get a friend (or pay a lowbie) to help you out.  AFAIK none of the
Freeport Militia sees through invis.  Near the bar there is only one
Militia NPC on the dock, you can actually get to the bar without
invis if you come in on the boat (swim over to the part of the dock
near the bar and climb out there, the guard never ventures out onto
the pier so this works with the translocators as well, if they're
up on your server).  Getting back out will require either invis or
a helpful port class (or gate potion).  Near the Arena is, again,
only one guard wandering outside so once you're past him you won't
need invis again until you leave.
