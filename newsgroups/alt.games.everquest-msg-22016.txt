You might be able to hack something together using Excel or similar. 

I grouped with people a lot during the early months of the game, and
we always paid strict attention to loot order. Then, I limited myself
to a small circle of friends for a long time, and we didn't worry
about it.

I was pleased to discover recently, as I branched out to group with
more complete strangers, that most people now feel the say way I do
about loot - for conventional stuff, whoever wants it can grab it, and
no one cares. For serious goodies, roll for it.

If you're watching loot order real carefully, some poor sap always
gets stuck with the job of keeping track. It's a lot more fun to just
not worry about it.
