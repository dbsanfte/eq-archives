    When I was recruiting with my guild, I got nothing but rots for a month
until I joined. Look at my Magelo now (www.lotuscult.com, in the roster
section I'm Delores the cleric), compare it to yours. Gullible? Or maybe,
just maybe, I respected the work people had put in prior to my showing up
and felt they should be rewarded for it before I was?
