See my final comment below.

Both reasons why I don't buy the argument that one is the launching pad for
the other. That approach doesn't make sense to me. The only approach that
makes sense is two products serving two different markets. Why they called
it EverQuest II is a good question. Obviously, for branding purposes the EQ
word needs to be present. Perhaps they were disappointed with the results of
"EverQuest Online Adventures" and "Lords of EverQuest", neither of which
managed much traction, and decided instead to risk the confusion.

I don't get this complaint at all (I realize it's not yours, I just wanted
to add this here). I liked the atmospheric new name space. Anarchy Online
used "English names" for zones like "Meetmedere" and "Varmint Woods".
Thanks, but I'll take xved and tipt.

There's a large body of software developers who truly believe (and some will
admit it) that the nature of bugs is such that you will never expose most of
them with in-house testing and that the best way to get them rooted out is
to release them into the public so that users can find them and help you
eradicate them. Remember, fixing a bug is different from finding a bug.
Developers may know a bug exists but they generally can't fix it unless they
can actually reproduce it in-house. Reproducibility is generally a
prerequisite to fixing most bugs, so getting more people exposed to known
bugs is one way of potentially accelerating reproducibility and therefor a
fix. A Test server is a kind of compromise that acts as a last minute buffer
to catch some of the problems and expose them prior to release. It's usually
too late in the cycle to allow for much feedback at the feature level, it's
more for catching those big showstoppers that would otherwise have made it
into production.
