And, to me, the key phrase is "JUST ABOUT to go off" isn't it?  This
indicates a breakdown in communication somewhere along the line.  

Either:


Cause A
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
Mr or Mrs. Druid is not psychic, and possibly being unaware of your
unspoken (?? see paragraph below) clerical techniques, might have cast
their Heal a few seconds BEFORE your hotbutton was pressed.  Thus, as
you decide to take action and grandly announce the incoming Heal,
they're already a split-second away from their spell going off and
landing. 

As mentioned by Tony, lay out your heal policy *before* the manure
pile hits the windmill - find out what max hitpoints everyone has,
make notes, then TELL the group (as my cleric does) that "Since you
have X hitpoints I will heal with Y at Z% of your hitpoint bar".  This
sorts out what the backup healers NEED to do (and need NOT do) and
also lets the group know you are a cleric with a plan, which is a very
reassuring thing, I can assure you  :)


Cause B
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
You HAVE already laid out at what % hitpoints you will heal at, and
they ignore this sensible plan, in which case bitch as hard as I
would.


Oh, and as Tony says, for heaven's sake, lighten up. You seem to think
the game revolves around clerics, for some reason, and that groups
should always act to keep you happy, which is bloody irritating on a
number of levels.  If you grumbled as much as this in a group of mine
you'd be thrown out for crimes against Hilarity - it's a GAME  :)
