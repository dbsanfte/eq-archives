	You need to have your sarcasm detector recalibrated.

>5 9's is a myth in any IP server farm. 

	Not at all.  It is, however, expensive.  It doesn't take
trillions but it *does* take millions to do it right.  One thing that's
greatly driven down the cost of implementing "zero down time" networks
is the commoditization (is that a word??) of networking components including
the software involved.  

	Look at it this way:  when was the last time google.com was down?
Do you think they have more money than NASA? :-)   Or just better engineering?
