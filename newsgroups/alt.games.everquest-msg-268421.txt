Well some friends who are big time EQ/EQ2 fans think the images in zines look too
cartoonish, and the game forums sound a little immature.  But they still did the
beta tests and said that once you start playing you don't think about the
cartoonish look anymore.  Other than the forum, their biggest complaint was that
they couldn't start in the same city (they were horde), but who knows...

I don't like the look of WoW but I will likely check it out at some point.  The
forums were a big turn off to me.  Then again, I am not into pvp.
