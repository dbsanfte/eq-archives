There are shaman-craftable gate potions to Field of Bone and Permafrost
as well.

You can also loot one deep in Cazic-Thule (or buy from someone
who looted one) a potion that gates you to the top of the wizard
port spot inside Cazic-Thule.  What's great is that it's the
only instant-cast gate potion in the game, so it can get you
out of sticky situations instantly, no-fail, no chance of
interruption.
