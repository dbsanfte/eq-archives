Um, yes - I often chop emails I reply to to save space. The entire point of
your post seemed to be that you had no fuggin idea on what I was talking
about, so I that I left in, albiet economically.

You don't think I am going to actually go to the trouble of actually quoting
all your fancy wordworking back at your when your dissing me do you? By the
way, a more accurate image would have been a drooling drunken idiot with
crayons stuck in my ears...

Actually this thread has me doubting my own stupidity. I always took it for
granted I was one on the more insane stupid fucks inhabiting Norrath, but
you and Loremaster have me wondering whether I have been outclassed.

You do actually realise my initial post wasn't the usual drooling whining
verant bashing troll don't you? It was actually just an observation, albiet
written in a colourful fashion which even included it's own disclaimer
mentioning that I was under the influence of alchohol when writing.

I'd say someone has been pissing in the Weetbix box again...
