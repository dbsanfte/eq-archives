As others have noted, I wrote one a couple of weeks ago.

I wrote it at the request of a guildmate who wanted something to pull all
the conversations out of her logs so that she could reference them.  She
didn't care about the other stuff.  It was simple to just extend the concept
since people were asking for something to remove converstions from the log
anyway.

I didn't say anything about it here because, to be honest, it's not that
useful a program.  Why?  Conversations don't take up as much of the log as
you might think. On my logs, pulling out the conversations reduced their
size by about 10%.  In the year and a half or so since they added LOG=TRUE,
I've collected perhaps 400M of logs on various characters.  That means I'd
save about 40M on 18 months worth of logs.  And if my disk space ever gets
so tight that I can't spare 40M, stripping my logs isn't going to help very
much, or for very long.

And it really doesn't slow down the parser all that much, either.

But if you want it, it's at <http://www.cws.org/~pasketti>.
