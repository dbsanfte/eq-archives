So not true. Perl Jamming. My partner. Got changed on the most
inoffensive generous polite giving person I've ever met because
someone random petitioned.

Now sure, it was against the rules, yadayada, but its neither
offensive nor "serious". At worst it breaks the immersion of a 
game that rapidly has any attempt at "immersive" RPG world 
consistency being poured out the window for more clickclickDING 
gameplay.

Naming policy is implemented and enforced to one consistent
rule only: Which GM you get decides what the hell they want to
do about it.
