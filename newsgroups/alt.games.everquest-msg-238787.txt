$30 gets you Everquest Evolution which has most of the expansion packs 
already in it. $13 a month to play after the first free month.

Not sure I understand the question.

Most will tell you that you need a LOT of time to really enjoy the game. 
Basically you can't do much in the mid-to-upper level game without having 
a lot of time to sink into it. The expansion Lost Dungeons of Norrath 
(LDON) kind of changes that a bit, it is designed for quick dungeon 
crawls that can be done in a small amount of time.

> what kind of system do i need?

I run it on an Athlon 850mhz, 512mb RAM, GeForce 2 mx 64mb video. The 
game runs fine for me except in the really crowded zones I get some lag 
such as in Plane of Knowledge and the Bazaar. Those zones aren't for 
combat anyway so it's playable if a bit annoying.

> what characters are the best to play?

Depends on what you want to do. If you want to always find groups easy 
then a warrior, enchanter, or a cleric might be a good option. If you 
want to solo then a druid or necromancer might be a better choice. There 
are lots of other classes and each have their strengths and weaknesses. 
There is no one clear "best" class.

> can you buy the basic everquest and be content?

IMHO, no, it doesn't give you a good enough example of what the game is 
about now. For one thing you will not have access to the Bazaar which is 
the main trading place in EQ (and trading, while not essential, is highly 
recommended). You will also not have access to the Plane of Knowledge 
which is sort of a "hub" zone which can connect to tons of different 
places very rapidly, and is sort of a central meeting place for nearly 
everyone in the game to get groups formed and etc.
 
> really, just anything at all that comes to mind

It's not really a good game for the casual player. Expect to put in at 
least 15 - 20 hours per week to get anywhere in this game, and of course, 
a LOT more than that as you get into the upper levels. It also is a lot 
more fun if you can play it with friends.
