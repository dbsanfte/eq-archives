If you're a Neut, and having trouble leveling in the QHills/BB because of
the constant warfare, then try moving over to Misty Thicket/Runnyeye.  West
Karana might not be too bad, either, if you know what areas to avoid, and
can hook up with someone who can keep SoW active on you, so you don't spend
forever and a day just running.

The reason why things are so sour between the Neuts and Goods in that
particular region (QHills/BB) is that when the Goods in Qeynos talked of
peace and working together against the Evils, the Neuts turned on them
instead, and tried to slaughter them out of existence.

Only in Everfrost, where the Goods took the offensive, did the Goods end up
with a place to live.  If the Goods in Everfrost didn't constantly attack
the Neuts, then there wouldn't be any Goods in Everfrost...or anywhere else
on Antonica, for that matter.  Why?  Because the Neuts (not the Evils) would
have wiped them out.

By their actions, the Neutral Team has shown themselves to be a far worse
enemy to the Good Team than the Evils.  Except for a few individuals and a
couple of guilds, "Neutral" on Sullon Zek is not 'neutral.'
