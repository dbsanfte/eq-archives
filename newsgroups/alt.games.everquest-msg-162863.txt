I always thought killing willowisps was supposed to be a good money
maker, not sure if it's as profitable as the aqua goblins or not, but
supposedly if you turn in the greater lightstones in S. Ro (evil
races), NK (good races, and also a lady in Oasis), you get a
concordance of research for each greater lightstone which you can sell
back to the vendor for 8 or 9 pp.

(FYI, you need a magic weapon to kill willowisps)
