Nope, that won't work.  You can't transfer a character unless you are the
original owner of both accounts.  I found this out the hard way cuz I bought
a used copy (new to this kind of thing I didn't know the difference) from
someone who got the game for Christmas but decided they did not have time to
play.  Now the character that my daughter started on my account cannot be
transferred to hers.
