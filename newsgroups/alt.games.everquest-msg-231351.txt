The one I'm really looking forward to is called College.  I've been waiting
a few years to get enough free time to play this one (though, I've already
been twinked by a few courses, courtesy of the Navy).  With any luck, I'll
be starting on the Virginia Tech server in the College of Architecture zone.

The only problem is, this game costs alot.  Paying for it is going to be
kinda interesting, since I had to quit my job to make more time to play, and
the time sink will likely preclude me from playing other games.

OTOH, the chances that the hawt chixx0r I'm hitting on is actually a female
are drastically higher.
