Thanks, I was beginning to think I was the only one seeing anything. :)

And, Richard, as far as the commentary goes, I'm not suggesting 
chauvinism in a negative sense. Faned mentioned the word chivalrous, and 
I'm grateful, because that sort of sums it up... one *can* treat men and 
women differently without it being a negative thing. And that was the 
line of my speculation... that perhaps the narrative you composed for 
the 'female' mage was different (not 'more' or 'less' disparaging, 
merely 'different') than what you would have composed for a 'male' mage.

I found this particularly interesting because I think there are 
reasonable grounds to assign a high probability to the fact that the 
player was male. Leading me to wonder to what, if any, degree those of 
us who are 'chivalrous' would extend that 'courtesy' to the female toon 
of a male player on both conscious (and subconscious) levels.

Reading your post, I would have found your post slightly jarring had it 
been unchanged save for masculine pronouns, leading me to speculate that 
  perhaps you had (subconsciously) written about a 'female'. I examined 
my own justification for finding it 'slightly jarring' and found that it 
was because I do beleive that men and women are different, and I found 
your characterization to line up more closely with traits that I think 
are more common in women than men.

Perhaps I've just opened myself to be flamed to a crisp by those who 
hold that men and women think and behave identically, but so be it. I've 
had years of exposure to both (brothers/sisters & friends), and I will 
hold to my conviction that we *tend* to approach everything from 
friendship to conflict differently. There are no hard and fast rules, 
but I find the differences line up along gender lines more than mere 
coincidence would allow.

At any rate, I'm pleased you recognized that no malice or offense was 
intended, and I'll take your denial at face value.
