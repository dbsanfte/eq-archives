Hmm, looks like some stuff there to bring Paladins up to snuff on damage
output.  Looks promising.

You'll notice, though, the wording.  "You may train in this ability twice
each level, beginning at level 61."

I take it, if you don't take advantage of it before you level, you'll lose
yoru chance, unless you de-level?  Maybe they meant for alt. advancement to
be an "as-you-go" thing.

The way I see it, if that's the case, the best thing to do is level up, max
your skills, then de-level and fill the AA abilities.
