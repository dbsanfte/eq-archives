wood working designs?  have you found any good sites that have furniture
plans?  I have searched and searched, but havent found any good sites that
don't charge an arm and a leg.

On rec.woodworking, JOAT posts plans all the time.  I don't really look at
them.  I generally buy plans that interest me, then figure out what I don't
like about the plan, and create my own from that.  Generally, it involves
putting proper joinery in.  It's amazing how many plans out there have bad
joinery just to make it easier to build.

There's www.freeplans.com.  I've not tried them.  The deal is they send free
plans, but in the email, they also send offers from their advertisers.  It's
kind of like self spam.  Do a google search on rec.woodworking and you
should find other sources, as well as a lot of people telling others they
should have done a google search on rec.woodworking.  A regular internet
search might also turn something up.

Doing your own plans is time consuming, but it's not hard.  You can do it
with pencil and paper (graph paper recommended).  I use AutoSketch by
autodesk, which makes corrections a lot easier, but if you don't use it a
lot, paper is easier.

Start with an idea or a picture, measure the area you want the item to fill,
and base your item measurements on the area it is to fill.  If you are
building furniture, you may want to take some measurements of similar
furniture you already own.  This will give you a ballpark for appropriate
dimensions, especially for ergonomic proportions.  If you are making a
chair, base the dimensions on your most comfortable chair.

The design I'm currently working on is a "dream" bench.  After that, I'm
designing a display cabinet for my wife's collection of ceramic cottages.  I
had her pick a style from a furniture ad that was delivered in the paper.
The items in the add were all full height, and she wants it to be about 40"
tall, so I need to make it shorter, but I know the style she wants, so I can
incorporate those elements into my design.  It's really just a matter of
translating those thoughts to paper.

Cheers,
Eric
