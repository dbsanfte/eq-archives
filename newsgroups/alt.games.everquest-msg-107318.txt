Why?  Mages have a better way of checking if a mob is up.  It works no
matter how big the zone.  Seriously.

This report is a clear case of killstealing.  The only issue is
intent.  It's quite possible that the mage had no intention of of
killstealing, but based on his actions, I suspect he knew exactly what
he was doing.  The correct response in this case is to /petition, but
it's almost impossible to prove who engaged first.
