The easiest way to get your faction up with the Dark Elves (at least the
first two zones) is to do the "wine quest"...short version of this is to get
someone to invis you, run to the 3rd gate with 8 backpacks full of red wine
and go into the library, in their is a guy that you can give 4 at a time too
and it raises faction with dreadguard outer/inner, and dark bargainers, with
no faction hits!!!
