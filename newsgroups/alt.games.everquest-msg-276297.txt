I don't think that he was directly comparing the two.  He was saying
that the olympic medal would be meaningless if you could pay for it.
If you could pay your country's olympic team selection comittee to be
selected to go to the olympics and you could pay the other competitors
to let you win then the win is meaningless.  If everyone could do that
and all the olympic winners from now on were the people who could bid
more than the others then all olympic medals would be meaningless.

In the same way, finding the cool magical item would mean nothing if
everyone else bought it.

When you see someone with a coffee mug or t-shirt proclaiming them to
be Father of the Year does it actually impress you?  Or do you just
assume that it was bought from a shop?  To me, it wouldn't even suggest
that they were good father.
