Gamecommander will let you use voice commands to cast spells, perform
socials, etc.

If you want to chat with other players, then you want to give Rgerwilco, or
Bttlefield Cmmunicator a try.

I have used Roger wilco in the past, and it is a BIG improvement when
grouped. BUT, your other group members have to get it going as well.

I use Gamecommander, and like it alot.
Great support in their forums as well. Gotta love a software company like
that !

Gamecommander was also designed to work alongside products like Rogerwilco.

Hope that this helps.
