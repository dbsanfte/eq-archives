Oh hell yeah.  Druid casts regen/chlor on the Necro.  Casts snare on
the mob.  If it's a real tough mob, he can drop his DoT's on it
because they stack with necro DoT's.  Necro DoT's (duh), Fear's, and
sends his pet after it.  A surefire recipe for Whup Ass.

Me and my necro buddy can take down red con's fairly easily, as long
as I can get a snare to stick.  :-)
