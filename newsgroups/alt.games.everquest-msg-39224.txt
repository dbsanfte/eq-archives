I made it as far as Liveside in LGuk, but unfortunately, there was
already a rogue who had been waiting for 4.5 hours, plus an Elf bard who
was next in line. Why they bother, since they already have infravision,

Anyway, I'll just keep Parsifal camped there and hope for the best.

Thanks to all for the excellent information.
