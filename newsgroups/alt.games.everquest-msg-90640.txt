I don't know about Wizzie spells, but Druid spells can be rather expensive.
That's why we either charge or ask for donations.  I have no problem buffing
and SoWing for free.  It's my job.  But once a Druid buys those port spells,
we're out of cash so fast our heads spin.  It's just a quick way to make
some cash for our other spells of the same level, or the next level.  Ever
think of that?
