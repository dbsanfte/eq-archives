I had one as well, for about three years.  Nice car, shame about the semi
that removed it from existance.

The fact that you are driving the car is proof that you were "in the market"
for one.  You just prefered the price of free.  In other words, I have to
assume anyone who uses bootleg merchandise is a "potential customer."  They
just don't want to have to pay for it.

No, but neither are they _completely_ at fault.  At the core, their
copyrights are being violated.  The fact that they are complete and total
bastards, who take advantage of their artists and are practicing collusion
to an extent that really should set off anti-trust laws is another point
entirely.
