I do, in  a way; if I'm killing something with chants (of which
there are admittedly 5, a nice tight twist if you can manage it)
then I'm not singing -any- of the rest of that list; don't need
heals cause I'm not letting mr mob touch me while all I have is a
drum in my hand, don't need snare cause I'm faster than mr mob
with my 2 minute selo, Tboots, or Run, don't need selos cause I'm
not going to play that more than every two minutes (and frankly
I'm not going to play it ever for fighting purposes, its silly)
don't need charm cause I'm busy chant kiting... and probably
cause I've run out of adds or mana to charm with.

That said, I was joking, as I've detailed in my other posts in
this thread, there are lots of things two bards can do to kill
more than twice the mobs per hour as one bard; its just that
their -best- kill rate, swarm kiting, isn't one of those things
(someone even proposed a way of making that work in theory... I
just don't think it would go well in practice.
