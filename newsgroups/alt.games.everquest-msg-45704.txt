I made a Erudite cleric, and followed Cazic Thule, which means started
in Paineel.  All I saw was a bunch of anti-social necro's, who did
anything but role play.  Everyone was kill stealing to get the
decaying skelts with the cracked staff, sells for a plat to vendor.

And if I hear "Ding lvl 2" again, I'm gonna puke. Someone kills three
bats and has to let everyone know.

I also love how when necro's life tap, it says "beams a smile at
whatever" in Erudite. I guess in theory, just by hanging around
necro's of various races you can pick up thier language.

I see the population of this server dropping extremely fast. Coupled
with the fact that all chars will be deleted in a couple months, not
many are gonna invest too much time into it. Unfortualy, can't do a
/who all 40 50 and stuff to see what the powergamer's status is.

And as mentioned, this will be the ideal server for a group of friends
to get together once a week to only group together. Most places are
gonna be bring your own group, so should work out.
