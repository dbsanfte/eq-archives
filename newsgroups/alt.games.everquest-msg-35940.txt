I spent over an hour in the tech chat channel lineup
only to crash and be relegated to the bottom of the list.
Then tech help closed. :-(

All of a sudden I now have a mouse pointer stuck in the
middle of my screen. Another mouse pointer works fine.

I have tried rebooting, uninstalling and reinstalling, updating
drivers etc nd the damn pointer persists.

Anyone experience this and know how to fix it ?

Thanks
Jim
