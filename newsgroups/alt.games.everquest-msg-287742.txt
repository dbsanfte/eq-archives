Initially, you can only hire an Apprentice or a tier 1 Journeyman.  I'm
told you can "unlock" access to better (and more expensive) mercs by
progressing through the new expansion, but I haven't done that yet.

Mercs don't take a share of the loot (other than their salary), but do
take a share of party experience, including adding to the total party xp
just like a player character would.  Your merc thus "levels up with you",
i.e. your merc is usually the same level as you (with occasional hiccups
when you ding, or shroud/unshroud, etc.).

Also of note: they count toward the size of the party, so two player
characters plus a merc can take an LDON mission, and can use Leadership
skills such as the HoTT window (and the party leader gains LXP, too).

The tier 1 journeyman still has just two stances.  I don't know how much
higher tier I need to get access to more.  Higher tiers of course cost
more to hire and maintain.

The tank actually does okay.  It's not a great tank, but it stands up
almost as well as my Anguish-geared monk.  If I tell the merc to tank,
I can pull a mob past it and it will grab aggro instantly before I even
get hit once.  (I think it does a stun.  And of course it always times
it perfectly.)  Running a monk/cleric two-box, I find the tank adds
another 50% or so to my DPS, and it means if I need to FD to buy a few
seconds for a heal to land, the mob switches to the merc instead of the
cleric.  At level 81 the tier 1 journeyman is costing me about 130pp
per hour, and easily pays for herself.

I also sometimes pop out a healer merc on the other half of the two-box,
but that one's just a cheapo tier 1 Apprentice for when I want a little
insurance.

And yes, I'm told the race of the merc doesn't matter.  (Else I guess
all the merc tanks would be ogres / trolls / iksar for the stun resist
and regen.)  So just pick one for aethetic reasons. :-)

You can buff your merc (and can see the buffs if you expand the bottom
part of your target window), but you can't give it weapons or pots to
use.

Mercs base some of their decisions on the "roles" assigned by the party
leader.  If the merc is Main Tank she'll try to hold aggro, otherwise
she'll just DPS (and perhaps offtank (not sure when it decides to do that).
You can't make the merc be Main Assist; a real player has to call the
targets.  If you're tagged as Puller, your merc won't follow you but
will stick with the nearest other party member(s), or will stay put if
it's just you and the merc.  But if you're travelling invis through an
area it's okay to bring the merc along; they don't trigger proximity
aggro (though they *can* trigger social aggro once they're in combat).

There are definitely still some bugs with mercs; see the official forums
for various threads. :-)  But overall they work pretty well.

p.s.: I was amused to see an Enchanter bitching about getting mezzed.
Poetic justice? :-)  I do wonder whether you could've suspended your merc
while you were mezzed to avoid having him die, though of course either way
you'd need to wait 5 minutes to get him back.
