The maximum non-critical, non-discipline, non-cripple damage for a weapon is
believed to be

[((Weapon Skill + Strength)/100) * (DMG)) + (Damage Bonus)]

for those characters that are above level 20. There is believed to be a max
damage cap below level 20 for which if the above equation causes you to exceed
this camp, you will hit for the cap instead of your max. The damage cap is
believed to be somewhere between 20-30 points, I cannot remember exactly.
