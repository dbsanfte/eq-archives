First Aid is a really nice skill.. its just totally wasted on lazy people
like me (too lazy to clear my bank/bags, too lazy to buy bandages, and too
lazy to just "regular solo" when I can run a bot that gives me absolutely
zero downtime)

Im kindof pleased with critical mend (I've had level 2 for a few months now,
and just recently its been working a lot more).. its the kindof thing that
saves your ass on a dragon fight and no group healer/dead healer, swings a
duel in your favour when you were getting pwnt etc

Well I was just refering to class stuff - I already have 2-3 levels of the
class stuff I wanted (dura, combat agility, stability, critical hits)

Most definately...  im still not convinced about purify body.. for the sake
of getting a cure/dispell its just not worth 9 levels.  And for a mob like
AL where the dot is a real killer, it does jackshit cuz he re-casts it so
often

I kinda wished we got a "WOW" damage skill in AA.. Paladins Slay undead,
rogues chaotic stab, warriors Flurry/Rampage skill etc... I feel kinda
ticked off that I have x amount more AA than other guilies but have jackshit
to show for it (and in the current situation never will)
