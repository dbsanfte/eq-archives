Furor is pissed about a very small problem that has a chance of
effecting a tiny percentage of players and trying to convince us that
EverQuest isn't what it used to be? /yawn

FTR, "the Vision" was a punchline the moment it entered the
datasphere. EverQuest is the game it is because those people who
trumpeted the Vision hardest were overruled all along. If they hadn't
been, every server would be FV. Allowing GMs to go from server to
server based on where they are needed is better customer service, not
worse.

So no, I don't have to agree with his latest post. He's still a whiner
who doesn't understand why the lion's share of the game's resources
don't go to the lowest margin players (people who are on more than 150
hours a month.)
