Here is the story without the annoying html, in case any of

  Indeed.  And you will find that in posting in html, you'll
"urk" several people on this newsgroup.  You stand a good
chance of getting flamed for it, in fact.  Which is too bad,
in a way, since this _was_ a funny story, and the type of
post that I truly enjoying seeing.  
   So keep them coming.  Just lose the html.
