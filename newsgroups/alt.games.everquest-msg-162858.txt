Run 3 is utterly completely 100% impossible to get until 51.

If the OP is 51+, then I agree, get a bracer of the hidden or a goblin earring
or heck, even a spyglass.

But if he's not (and not really close) Jboots are a better investment than
Tboots, shouldn't they be worth at least as much?

And is there anything else that comes even close to being worth what
TBoots/JBoots are for a non SOW caster?

Even my bard, quite capable of Selos, finds his TBoots invaluable.  Selos takes
a song slot, you see.  TBoots make him half again as powerful on the move!
