That's my quesdtion.

Here is the set-up.

I needed bat wings for my levitate spell (19 Druid at the time)

Weny back to Greater Faydark and started killing bats. Got ONE wind.
Somebody told me that they would not give me much loot because I was
so high level compared to them.

So, my question is does loot spawn when killed? Or does it spawn when
the MOB spawns?

If this is the case how do people farm the items for crafting when
they get to higher levels? (ie Pelts and spider silk)
