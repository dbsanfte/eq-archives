Just wondering if people on other servers have this "pre -nerf" centi
longsword auction scam like we have on Tribunal. 

Everyone and his brother is popping up selling "Pre -Nerf" centi
longswords for something like 2 - 4 k. The weird thing though is we
never see the supposed LORE centi longsword sold, EVER. Once again
though, "pre -nerf" ones constantly.  The regular non existant LORE
one is supposed to sell for 1 k plat and someone from another server
said there is no lore one for sure and centis are down to 800 plat
there.

So I and some other people started auctioning in our auction zone EC
and the auctiong channels. I was auctioning "56 druid will come to
you, look at your LORE centi longsword in the trade window, then pay
you 100 plat for seeing the LORE centi longsword and port you to
wherever you want to go"..... cheep cheep cheep (crickets) Finally one
guy auctioned "trading a fungi tunic for a LORE centi longsword" cheep
cheep cheep (crickets)

So we came to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a lore
centi longsword. It seems to be a conspiracy just like the supposed
"lore" bloodpoint scam. The problem is that everytime you bring it up
someone, probably one of the scammers, chimes in "Oh THERE IS A LORE
ONE THOUGH, I'VE SEEN IT YEAH." "Ok then,  get the guy who has one and
I'll pay you and him both 100 plat just for seeing it" cheep cheep
(crickets) It seems that it has even gone as far as people claiming it
on allahazams now. Once again though, no one actually has one for
anyone to see.

So are people trying to pull this crap on your servers too or is this
just a dumb thing on the tribunal server? If these were really
dropping there now LORE you'd sure as hell see a lot more of them
being sold and existing than absolute zero. I also don't think you'd
see 10 or 15 different auctions of "pre -nerf!" centi Longswords per
day.
