Erm well it wasn't the problem of faction I was worried about - I was 
wondering if the mobs I might have to face to *get* some of the items 
would be beatable to a level 14 mage.  For example, the broom quest, you 
need a griffon feather.  Now I *know* you can just buy a griffon feather 
many times, but I really do want to do it myself.  I'm just trying to 
find somewhere that tells me if it *can* be done so I'm not running back 
and forth Norrath only to find out the stuff I need is on a level 30 mob 
with a big-ass ugly stick to beat me with :)  But allakhazam seems to 
have *some* idea, which is better than none, so thanks for the posts, 
all.
