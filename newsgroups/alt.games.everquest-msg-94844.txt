Hello,

I was reading on http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/ some of the
history of Norrath. But after reading that, I was just wondering where I
could find more history. Also I had a few questions.

1) Who are the Combine? Were they the snake people we now see on Luclin?
Also were they the race that inslaved the Iksar?

2) Why was there that meeting held where all the races were and the Dark
Elfs showed up and poisoned the Kerrans. And runed the night. Why was the
meeting held and why did the Darl Elfs rune it? What was there plan?

I hope that you guys can answer my questions or point me to a web address
where I can read more about the history of Norrath.

-Dylan-
