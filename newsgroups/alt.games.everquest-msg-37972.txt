The routes aren't THAT different, thanks to them being (nearly) colocated.

The "somewhere inbetween" that prevents me from getting to a world server,
but I can get to the login server?  That's in their building.

In fact, I have seen "distant router" problems before.  But the funny thing
is... if I can't hit my server... I can't hit the loggin server either...
nor "patch" ...  And USUALLY I can't hit the effing website either.

No, I'm afraid I don't believe "not us" if I'm talking to them in chat.
