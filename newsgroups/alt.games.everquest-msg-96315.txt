Nice one Arolphin. Thanks for that.

Its just getting quite difficult to drag people away from their daily xp
grind to any of these places. I think the web guides emphasise xp grinding
in zones like LOIO and DL too much, and people take them as gospel. Its nice
in a way because it means most of the mid-level dungeons are empty or near
empty, so getting a good camp spot isnt that difficult, although I still
havent got my FBSS :((

 I count myself lucky that I got a nice guild, not an uber guild by a long
way, but filled with chars who like to explore new zones and try to defeat
dungeon "boss" mobs with tactics and general good group play. Anyone who has
been told to grind through the levels by playing safe all the time should
read the message above. The fun is not solely in the levelling, but in the
group play, chat, and the sense of satisfaction you get from taking a risk
and coming away from it the victor.
