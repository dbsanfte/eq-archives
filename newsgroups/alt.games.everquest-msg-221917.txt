And, evidently enough, most people in Europe contend otherwise. Not even 
the most rabid right-wing party in Europe campaigns on a gun-
legalization platform, as they would be laughed out of the political 
landscape. Fortunately, there is no 2nd Amendment here to clutch at.

Hitler was *elected*. If the German population had been armed to their 
fucking teeth, he would have still been elected.

But let us let that one pass. You have another chance to come up with an 
example of a dictator overthrown or coup-de-etat defeated by an 
intervention of the armed populace.

Yeah, I have too. Wait, it was a Charles Bronson movie. Never mind.

Damn, and after all the acrimony, we find that we actually agree on 
something.
