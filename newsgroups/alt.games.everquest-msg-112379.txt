What a tremendously helpful group this is, that's many suggestions for me to
be looking at, so I'll be printing up maps for each of those zones sometime
this morning. Just to point something out though, I'm happy to fight single
mobs, my question wasn't aimed at quadable areas, I grind exp a lot, this
doesn't bother me, I'm just bored of Seafury's in OOT. If you'd care to add
more suggestions of large(ish) outside (not dungeons) I can single pull from
to take me from 55 to 60 I'd be a happy *soloing* Wizard indeed.

Thank you again everyone, very helpful. Be safe ...

Stevie. (Stormhammer)
