Better than getting a bow is making one.  Buy a fletching kit and place a
bow staff (rough oak is cheapest?) and hemp string in the kit.  I found that
if this was the very first combine for fletching, it never failed for the
low level bow.  Then, get a silk string, place in fletch kit with the bow
and it's a no-fail combine for a faster bow.  After that, start making
arrows for your bow.  Cheaper and better bow will not be had at low levels.
