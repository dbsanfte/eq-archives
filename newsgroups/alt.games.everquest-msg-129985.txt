You will note that I did not say that you will always make it.  So far, I
have been killed in Kithicor once, and I had IU up at the time.  Well, I had
IU up until shortly before I died, it faded out at the worst possible
moment.  I don't know for certain, but I believe that what happened to you
was that someone else got the mobs aggroed, and got them too close to the
wall for later folks passing through.
