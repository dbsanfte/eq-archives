I have to add to this... quests worth doing bit...
When I started out my Druid I moved over to Rivervale...
At lvl 5 I jumped into the water and did the pirahna tooth quest... hit lvl
9 only a mere 3 hours later.

With tons of experience, pockets lined with gold and lots of food and
booze.... I had all my spells I needed.

This was a quest worth it indeed....

Or how about lightstones? Greater Lighstones... sheeesh even now at 46 I
still kill em for that possible 8pp those will turn around and get me.
