No, its not. The vast majority of pickup groups do easy LDONs so
they can do multiple runs more quickly with less risk. I have
regularly, when playing my little alt, got pickup groups where
I chatter and babble for 10-15 minutes with monosyllabic answers
then give up, because people just want to move through quickly.

Chatter only happens now with guildmates and uber friends alts
who dont care about levelling because they've done it all before,
in my experience. In LDON anyway.
