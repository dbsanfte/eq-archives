Curing Spreading Crud is a total waste of mana.  It's a very very slow 
damage over time, doing 3 HP per six second tic. If you're fighting 
fiends, just don't bother to cure anyone until you're all done 
fighting fiends for the day.  They'll just run out and get it again 4 
seconds later.  An extra light healing a minute is going to be a lot 
cheaper than 4 casts of cure disease every third time a fiend swings at 
them.

Personally, I would slow.  I would definitely slow the scary red mob, but 
slow the trash too.  If your slow is resisted, though, don't worry about 
it overmuch.  The mob's probably going to be almost dead by the time you 
get a second attempt in.  Shamans and enchanters share the slowing duty.  
It's good to know what levels you get certain slows, and what level they 
do.  In general, the shaman slow is superior at the same level.  But an 
enchanter a couple levels higher may well have a superior slow, and you 
should let him do it.  The same applies to haste, except the enchanter 
generally has the better one.

Why to slow:  it saves the healer mana.  Saving the healer mana is almost 
always a really good idea.  Especially for shamans, since that might be 
you!  Why not to slow:  if the group's DPS is so high that mobs are down 
to 30% health before you can land slow, screw it.  

And, as others have said, move disempower to the back of the book, unless 
you're really bored and have mana coming out your ears.  The only 
particularly effective spell in that line is Cripple, and it's only really 
useful against mobs that proc, flurry, or rampage, which you likely won't 
encounter much of until your early-mid 50's.
