Personally, I'd have gone for more +mana gear and worried about INT later,
but that's just my opinion :).

A thought on gear though - you might want to check out the player lists on
http://eq.castersrealm.com to see what other enchanters are wearing. They
are probably not very up to date, but it would give you a chance to see what
other enchanter are wearing in their mid-30s (which I'm guessing is roughly
where your twink cash puts you.
