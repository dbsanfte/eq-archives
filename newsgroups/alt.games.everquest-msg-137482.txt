The trick here, is to turn your normal user into a power user, for you'll
agree with me that a power user is likely to spend more money.
As such, the marketing mindset is not ridiculous at all.
No more ridiculous than AMD with there Athlon XP.
Your normal user is already far more technically inclined than they where,
say, 10 years ago.
The normal user is fast dying out, there is your marketing premise right
there.

Just thought I'd ad that in )
