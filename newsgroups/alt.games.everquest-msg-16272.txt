Huh?

Your logic escapes me, are we talking about EQ or the real world? Your
statements make little sense in either context.

Except about the dubious cons, which is what seems to happen when a
threatening mob goes very green.

: P.S.  You don't have any bear by-products in your inventory do you?

Both my ranger and druid have animal by-products in their inventory,
including tailor made bags, quivers, and belt pouches. My druid is a 
tailor, (not a very good one I would add). You are missing something
very important my friend, and jumping to conclusions. 

I understand how the game works, which side my bread is buttered 
on, and play accordingly.
