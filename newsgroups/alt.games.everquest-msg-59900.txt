Interesting.  I'll have to test this some more.  This weekend I was soloing 
the hermit with Pheilmi and a TMal Gnoll started ripping my flesh apart.  I 
took off and let my faithful Jabober deal with him as I trucked it ( 
albeit, slowly while 20stone overlimit ) to the LR zone line.

I get about halfway there and sit down, facing the directon of the Hermit's 
compound.  The Gnoll never comes after me after a couple minutes, so I 
gather shadows and start heading back.  After I got within sight of the 
compound, the Gnoll starts heading towards me, and I ended up dying.

I wonder if it is Mob specific.
