Much better to put it on the left or right key.  With it on Forward, you
only press that once and then hold it typically.  Left/Right you are hitting
much more often, and so practicing the skill more often.  And since you are
using SD as a nav tool, having it on Left/Right while you are walking around
helps a great deal.
