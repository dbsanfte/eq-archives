Regarding your observations on thinking... even if you were right
about the 'men' part, that still leaves you out of the equation.

I believe the word you're looking for is "latter". If you don't
believe me, check with a man. Or just look in a dictionary if you know
how to use one.

What an excellent paragraph. Not quite "Jabberwocky" standards, but
still, entirely inscrutable.

If it was proper etiquette, it wouldn't call for criticism, would it?

Huh? Are you referring to where I stated that I wasn't an expert on
figure skating, but that I knew a perfect performance when I saw one?
If you follow the news at all, you might have noticed that I'm not
alone in that interpretation of the Canadian performance.

Again with the inscrutable.

You have a stunning grasp of the obvious.

What makes you think I'm Canadian? For that matter, what evidence do
you have that I'm female?

> So please either block me

That's twice now that you've suggestion I block you. In case it hasn't
occurred to you, you have that same option - don't read my posts, and
maybe you won't become so apoplectic.

This is me, yawning in abject terror.
