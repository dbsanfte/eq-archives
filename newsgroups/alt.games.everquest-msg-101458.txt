Ok, I asked where to hunt and you directed me there as well, but when I
went, I couldn't find the Forest Giant Arbors...do you have an approx loc of
where to hunt them?  I went as far NE as the swamp of no hope zone and
couldn't go any further due to a hill....do I need to go around this hill to
get to where you speak of?
