Im not sure such a thing exists...   www.thesafehouse.org  (Back Alley) is a
spoiler forum.. as in, you can post in there for information, strats,
spoilers etc. But they don't have writeups of all mobs, with so many
different zones, mobs, raids, and so many different tanking, healing strats
etc.. it would just be impractical.

The serverwide cleric channel might be a better source of "real time"
information... or of course, you could ask in here about specific mobs/zones
and eagerly await our response!
