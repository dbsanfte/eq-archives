Well it did for me (or NYC did) . near DL and some friends in KC had to
break off hunting because there were too many linkdeaths to hunt safely
(having 2 tanks and a cleric go LD just after pulling 2 ravishing is NOT
fun).

This happened all over the server by the way. Had our highest druid port
around to find a remote place to hunt safely, but no go :(
