Ditto that. Or my other favourite - specters outside Fear - they're undead,
don't have that many hps - do have a couple of nasty tricks (proc stun and
lifetap, high melee damage). There's one outside on it's own, and 3 or 4 in
the entrance. If you pull by rooting one, only one other should come, and
you can be far enough away he doesn't follow his friend.

Exp is awsome (newb zone exp modifier), and loot isn't bad (scyths sell for
12pp, bronze scyths for 3pp). Only problem is when you do pull from inside
they get stuck and then warp onto you - it means you'll take a few big hits.
