Well i'm a lvl 25 Ranger and can instantly spot all other scouts in my level
range. It's the same for the 30+ scouts. The armour in particular seems to
be based on the tier u are in rather than your class/lvl. E.g. you have 100
lvl 20-30 rangers running around wearing exactly the same armour.

Why only 1 AQ though? Why not 5 that offer different sets of armour. Their
stats wouldnt have to be that different but their look could. Why not allow
armourers to create more than 1 set of armour per tier?

I hope so too, I really want to stand out and be unique. I dont want to just
'Ranger Tier 4' etc.

Patch has just gone live by the way, mentoring is in, woot :)
