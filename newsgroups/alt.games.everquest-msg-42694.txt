I try to help and not be offense... but nobody cares about you here... your
not playing anymore and your not reading this news group anymore... why
should we help you with an attitude like you've been having... If you've
played for 2 years you know about buying selling... you know it happens...
you know it's illegal... why ask a question that you already know the answer
too? Not like your a 'n00b' fresh outta the market buying the game...

You continue to post on topics that you already know the answer too...
continue to flame in gueise of asking questions... stop trolling and leave
the news group and game like you said you were... please and thank you
