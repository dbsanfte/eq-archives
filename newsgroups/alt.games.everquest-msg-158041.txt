I am considdering leaving my guild on Tribunal. I won't mention the guild
name or use my characters name so as not to be pointing fingers. My biggest
problems center around timing. I live on the East coast and the raids often
seem to be focused on West coast time. Even on a weekend, a raid which
"starts" at 9pm my time is a problem. First, it will be as much as an hour
and a half before the raid actually gets to fighting. Then the raid will not
reach its objective till 1am to 2am. I get up at 5am for work, so even on
the weekends staying up that late doesn't work for me. Does any one know of
a guild on Tribunal that is:

1) Recruiting, and hopefully looking for a 54 warrior

2) Works on east coast time

3) Is strong enough to take on epic mobs?

Thanks.
