Typical verant they come up with a great idea in legends server and screw it
up by GREED and wanting to charge 40 bucks per months for it! Incredible!

I am so happy that I quit EQ years ago when I got my last character to lvl
50 and sold it for $500.00 bucks, Fuck verant they are what give gaming
companies a bad name!
