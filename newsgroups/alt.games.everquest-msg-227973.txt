Depends on the server and sometimes the time of day.  Don't even think 
about starting out on a PVP server.  No one's first character should be 
PVP.  You should know how to play your chosen class before you are 
thrown to the sharks on the PVP servers.
Stromm server is designated as the 'newbie' server.  That is a server 
that no one was allowed to move fully loaded characters from other 
server to.  Everyone had to start at level 1 on that server. There's 
level 65 on that server now tho.  I have heard that Stromm is a little 
easier on true newbies.

Sometimes it can get tedious, especially if you do any kind of 
tradeskill, usually newbies don't bothere with them so it won't be so 
tedious.  The game is how you make it.  I play for the community factor, 
I like to talk to my guildies and have fun, I don't always go out trying 
to get xp, sometimes I spend the whole time I'm logged in just talking 
to people.

There is a roleplay server called Firiona Vie, roleplay is actively 
encouraged on that server and the ruleset is slightly different.  I 
don't recommend starting out on that server because of some of the 
limitations due to languages and Trivial Loot code.
If you really want hack and slash, I recommend getting yourself a PS2 
and a network adapter and playing Everquest Online Adventures instead. 
It's a much faster paced game, you do have to do the quests in order to 
have all your spells or abilities but mostly it's grab 3 other people 
and go on a rampage on the nearest orc, bandit or undead camp.

You'll have to pay a subscription to play EQ just like on SWG.  If you 
don't have a credit card you can buy a game card, if you are going the 
game card route you have to have at least one to start your account, 
you'll get a full 60 days of play with the first card.

Good luck
