I don't think it's even that so much as it would probably be very
annoying to deal with people who are not aware of all the changes that
have been made since their copy of the P&P was written. Joe user may be
looking at section 8.5.1 and think they know what they are talking
about, but there are alot of temporary/interim updates that are released
that do not show up in the P&P, at least not until the next rev. As a
result, someone could be arguing exactly what is written in the doc they
downloaded from here, and still be completely wrong. I think THAT is
probably a big part of why things like this are not released to the
general PC population. A little knowledge can be a very dangerous thing.
