Up thru level 43 I did exactly this.  My cleric has a higher base str than wisdom,
and that relationship between the two was preserved as I leveled up.  At my
pinnacle of melee effectiveness, I had a 175 str unbuffed (150 wis) good AC,
and a two hander with which I could do 90 damage a swing.  I typically fought
in wolf form running str buffs to over 200, and found I could outdamage (not just
per blow, but per minute) most paladins my level.

I also had gear that would give me roughly 175 wis and 150 str, for those
situations where I wouldn't be meleeing.  But I looked for the more active
role as long as I could.

At 44, 2hb caps out, mobs start to get really hard to hit for decent damage,
Paladins start to take off in effectiveness, and it becomes more effective
to use the new nuke instead, even in a fear kite.

If your offense and weapon skills are capped for your level, and you
find something decent to weild, your strategy is going to be sound for
quite a while, and you may as well enjoy it while it lasts.  Just don't
spend an extraorinary sum on that str gear, as eventually you'll see it
relegated to the back of the bank vault.
