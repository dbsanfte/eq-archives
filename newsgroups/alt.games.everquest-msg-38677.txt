Again the number of true newbies per server is under a hundred. True
newbies are like virgin sorority girls at their first booze filled
frat party.  Affecting a change that screws long time subscribers over
to "help" a very few transitory players  (You do know its a one way
trip from newbiedom to playerdom right?) is a really stupid bad
decision especially when those older players now have an alternative
coming out in less then 2 months.  SOL really does mean Shit Outta
Luck for Verant.
