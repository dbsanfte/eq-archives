The level 20's are apprentices, true. The full guides start at 50, but
can be up to 54 depending on how long they do it, how active they are,
etc.  The Seniors start at 55 and get new powers the Guides don't have.
Among these is the ability to add, delete, and change Surnames. There
are also Elder guides in some cases, some wildcard SWAT team members who
jump around, and of course the server GM. But only the Senior's and
above can make the actual surname change. Oh, and there generally isn't
(to my knowledge "_A_ server Senior Guide". There will usually be
multiple ones, all with equal powers, but hopefully covering different
shifts.

This does not mean, however, that a Guide couldn't have answered your
request, checked in the "background" that the Senior thought it was fine
and asked him/her to do the change for you, though you may never have
spoken to the Senior or GM.  This could add confusion to the encounter.
