"bizbee" <tuberoo@ix.netcom.com> wrote in message lots of stuff....

I hear you thoroughly Bizbee, I saw a similar AFK-train-kill thing myself
last night at LOIO/FV zone line.  I had made several trips back and forth
from FM to FV doing bank runs, invis escorts (with me bard), etc.  Some guys
was afk there for like 2 hours.  He finally gets killed and comes back
screaming at entire LOIO zone.

You would think an entire zone full of people (a big one at that) telling
this thoughtless Gibbon to a) shut up, b)get over it, etc. would smarten him
up.  After retrieving his corpse he sat down in the same damn place and was
still there when I logged off like 2 hours later.

Worst-case scenario is when you accidentally group with these types of
fools.

Safe travels,
Sean...
