I've spent a large amount of my play time solo. One
thing that I've *always* done when traveling through
areas* that are basically Death Waiting to Happen to Me
(and I can't recall a single instance of getting jumped
or dying in places where I should have been nothing more
than a green greasy spot on the ground) is this: Get
to the very limit of the zone, where you can't go any
further and travel along that edge to the next zone
out spot. I've made the trip to and from Katta Castellum
that way (at least through Grimling and Tenebrous) and
I've made numerous trips through Burning Woods that way.
For instance, through Grimling, I followed the wall around
the city around and up the hill until I couldn't go any
farther, and just followed that line to the zone in point
to TM.

*I'm talking about outside zones. Dungeons/cities/tunnels
don't work that way.
