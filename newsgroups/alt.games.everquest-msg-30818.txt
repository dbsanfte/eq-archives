Languages are fun. I was partnered with a ranger one level higher than
me most of last night, and when we needed med breaks (not as often as
you'd think) he trained me in Barbarian while I trained him in
Erudian. I'd like to master every language in the game too, but so far
I'm just average or very good at most... Erudian is my only master
language other than Elvish, with Faerie being excellent.
