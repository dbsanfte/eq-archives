Welcome to the ranks of the minstrels!

If you've found your guild then the battle is half over. Bards don't have
spells, only songs. You get one per level except at twenty and som e of the
high fifties so you don't have to worry about spending uber-cash on your
upkeep.

There isn't a "singing" button. Songs are activated in the same way that
spells are. However, you can activate your songs using the
hotkeys. Click and hold on a spell-gem. It will appear on your
cursor. Click on a blank hot-key on the left bank. (Not the
abilities/main/combat/socials bank.)

Now, the thing about bard songs is that they (usually) last
for a set period of time after you stop singing them. Generally,
this is about six seconds or two "ticks".

If you haven't already had the light-bulb light up over
your head, this means that you can sing multiple songs and
have multiple effects at the same time. It's called
Twisting or, less commonly, Song Weaving. Suppose you have
three songs (Chant of battle, Chords of Dissonance,
and Hymn of Restoration) on your first three spell gems. You
map them to your first three hot keys so that pressing the '1'
key on your keyboard activates Chant, the '2' key activates
Chords and the '3' key activates Hymn.

You Twist by doing the following pattern:
1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 ...

You do it twice because the second press stops the current song
and the next press starts a new song. You have to learn the
timing, as stopping the song too soon will cancel its effect.
Watch the spell lights or watch for the casting message in
your battle spam ("You feel stronger. A Skeleton winces. Your
wounds begin to heal.") At a minimum, a bard should be able to
keep three song effects going at once. On a good link, four is
possible though I've seldom achieved it reliably. I think that
most of the time you have four, what you really have is the
fourth effect re-starting right after it just ended, giving the
illusion of four effects at once. Also certain higher-level
effects can last for longer than six seconds, making a 4-5
song effect possible. Three is the baseline, so don't worry
if you hear someone bragging about doing five or even six
songs. I've yet to see it done in practice.

Instruments will increase the effect of any song that
uses them. Right-click on the song in your spell book or
spell gem and you'll see the instrument it uses. Each time
you get a new musical skill (percussion, brass, wind,strings)
train a point in that skill to jump-start it and buy the
appropriate instrument.

There's lots more to learn but that's all you  need at the
beginning level. Check out the bard websites for some good
guides.

excellent info on bards as well.)

Bards are fun. Just wait until you get fifth level and
you get your speed song. :-)
