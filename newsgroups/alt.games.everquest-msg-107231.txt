ok, this might be a lame post, but i was going thru the bank and found on my
lvl 52 war iks a weapon that was given to me by the iks war guildmaster in
cab.  he also gave instructions to collect some other stuff and to turn it
in to get a better pike, and then another quest followed to get an even
better pike etc.  does anyone know what the best pike you get from these
quests is and if it is worth it to do the quest , or should i just destroy
the darn thing and free up room in the bank.
