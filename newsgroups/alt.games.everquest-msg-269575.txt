what you're doing wrong is basically comparing a game just released
with one that's been out for 6 or so years.
Take your EQ1 character, strip him/her from all the uber loot and arm
him/her with stuff that dropped the first month EQ was live.  Also,
hunt in EQ in areas where there was no exp bonus.  What can you kill
now and how many of those would you need?
Now, let's do this the other way.  Imagine your character in the EQ2 of
5 years from now.  The sword 2-8 you're using now will probably be a
10-20 +5 fire +5 STR +5 DEX +20 health +20 power.  See what color of
mobs you'll be able to kill, and how many of those you'll need.

By the way, the craziest consistent exp I've gotten in EQ2 was in a
group of 3, a fighter a rogue and me (cleric) killing things that were
yellow++ to me.  Each kill would give us half a bubble. 20 of those and
DING.
