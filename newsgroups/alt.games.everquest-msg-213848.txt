Actually, there's still the potential of finding the mobs you need not
available. The scouts you turn in to in order to spawn the mobs
despawn after the mob is killed and the needed follow-up turn-in is
done. They don't respawn for several days afterwards. Took me a month
to catch the Permafrost scout up.
