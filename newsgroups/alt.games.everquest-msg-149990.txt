This is totally unnecessary now.  Quite a while ago (about a year or
so), a patch changed it so that even a totally naked corpse with
nothing on it will not poof as long as there is salvageable exp
left on it (i.e., it won't poof until the rez timer runs out).

This also was made obsolete by a long-ago patch.  Being Feared
auto-runs you.

10k, I believe, or about 1/3 of her health bar.  But still not
the end of the world, as you say.
