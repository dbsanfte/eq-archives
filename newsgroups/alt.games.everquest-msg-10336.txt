Having a lev 53 bard myself, i can say that they can get very boring to
play after a period of time. At high levels your damage potentional with
weapons is sad (not counting epic), and mana sinks get annoyed if you sing
anything but 'crack'. I am the highest lev bard in my guild, and im always
getting invited on other guild raids. I can remember screaming for hours in
LG looking for a grp while i was lev 30-31, but the second i got to lev 32,
i was suddenly added to everyone friend's list.

My pet hate is people telling me what songs to play, i normally give people
2 warnings before i leave the grp. Any half decent bard knows what songs to
play at different situations, and if you are running out of mana, or out of
stamina it's not the bard's fault. While grping with people, you pick up
very quickly if they have grped much with a bard. A bard will change the
dynamics of a grp more than any other class, and a bard's style of play
will change depending on the members of a grp. A tank heavy grp will see
haste/Ac songs being played, while a caster heavy grp will see AC/crack
song being played.

Most bards quit playing after 32 because they are seen as being nothing
more than a mana battery. Bards need to realise they if a grp only wants
them to play crack, it's a bad grp and they should look for another grp.
Stand up to casters that 'demand' crack, and dont be afraid to lay down the
rules. Bards are normally the leaders of a grp, and are the most verstile
class around.

Here is one thing to think about.

Fighting a yellow caster, full well balanced grp (cleric, chanter, shammie,
bard, monk, warrior), fight length being 3 mins.

Option 1: Play crack
Option 2: Play MR songs

Option 1 --> In 3 mins, crack will give each caster enough mana to cast 1
spell.
Option 2 --> Mr is increased by 150.

Option 1 --> Warrior will need to be healed atleast twice, and other grp
members atleast once depending if spells are AE. Both Cleric and Shammie on
healing duty.
Option 2 --> 5% of spells fully resisted, 90% do less than 25% of max
damage, with 5% full damage. Tank needs one heal, everyone else looses
1yellow health.

In this situation it is better for a bard not to play crack. By playing 2
MR songs the cleric has more mana, and the backup healing can actually
fight without having to worry about mana reserves. There are situations
when playing crack 100% is required (multi mob pulls with chanter doing CC
the most common) but for 95% of the time the grp is actually worse off.
People actually need to let the bard decide what plan of attack is better,
rarther than demanding that crack be played.



My advise to new bards is simple, dont let other people tell you how to
play your class. Leave a grp that doesn't respect you, and the power of
your song.

Regards,
Brett
