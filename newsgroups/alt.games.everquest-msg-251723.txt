If you're of a level where you can solo in Velks, it's free with a small
amount of effort.

The only annoying part is that it is lore and no drop, so every time you use
one, you have to return to Thurgadin and make another.

Also, for a long time, it was not possible to make one if you had bad dwarf
faction.   I'm not sure if it is now, since they changed shopkeepers to not
go below dubious faction.  (A shopkeeper gives you the no-drop container to
do the final combine.  I'm not sure if they give it up at dubious, or if you
need apprehensive.)
