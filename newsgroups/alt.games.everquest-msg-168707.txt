>Fourth of July celebrations
>are particular favorites, according to several game developers. 

One heck of a celebration on Antonius Bayle server as those in the
Real World celebrated the removing of the New World.

But, seriously, it's typical isn't it?  Again Americans thinking that
the whole world exists within 50 states and that everyone on the
internet is American.

Sigh, no wonder 60% of Americans can't put the United Kingdom on the
map correctly...
