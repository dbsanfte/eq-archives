Yes, I have wondered about whether moving them is going to be a problem. 
It is interesting to note that on the EQLive page that describes the 
rules, etc. for character moves it says that you cannot move characters 
TO an account you are not the original owner of. I found it interesting 
they made that distinction and I am left to wonder if I will be able to 
move characters FROM an account I am not the original owner of to an 
account, which I am the original owner of.
