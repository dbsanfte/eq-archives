rofl, youre saying their tactics were already developed? You should have

2 weeks is fine, but im not working my butt off for nothing during that 2
weeks. Either they can eval me in a less demanding role, or they can
consider me for loot. I just wasnt prepared to put in 2 weeks of time with
no loot for them at that stage. Sheesh. What is peoples damn problem with
this?

Brag? You think im proud of the fact that I left my guild so I could level
up in peace, or that it even needs justification? What is up with you
