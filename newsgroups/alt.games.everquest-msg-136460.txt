I have noticed that if I filter only for class/race well over half the
items available get left off the list.  It appears that the list is
being cut off (before alphabetizing, means you don't necessarily see
all instances of a particular item, hate to pay 500 because you didn't
see the guy selling for 200).  Filtering for slot works well and type
seemed ok the couple times I used it.  Since so many items have no
stats filtering for stat should be good also.
