Ok I'm not flaming you Bizbee but I dont get this.  You have never been in Neriak
or surrounding zones and heard DE's referred to as darkies, inkies, etc,?  So if
a player creating a DE decides to go ahead and cut to the chase and name his
character Darky, a slang term used quite commonly in the game, he is all of the
sudden a real life racist?  The Guide who may have been trying to point this out
to you all of the sudden has no problem, in you eyes, with the term Nigger?  What
if i saw a snow white HEF running around with the name Bizbee?  Of course I would
have to report this to the GM's -  BIZ (no doubt pronounced Buys) BEE (no doubt
meaning B's plural, and we all know that B refers to blacks  so what we have here
folks is a snow white HEF running around with the name BuysBlacks.  Really gets
to be quite silly when you start telling people what their name is/means when you
don't even know them doesn't it Buys err Biz?

P.S I have seen to date two female druids on two different servers named
whitechocolate.  I have also reported a lev 2 Erud necro named Nigro.  The latter
was blatant.  I could even support you if it was an Erud named Darky, but a DARK
elf named Darky?
