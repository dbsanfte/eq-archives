Just to confirm that, I run Luclin on a Cel933 laptop with onboard ATI
Graphics. just turn all the models off.
No one has a machine that handles the Bazaar, such a computer will not be
invented until after true AI (and then, as it will have AI, it will decide
not to go in there as it's too much like hard work) just turn clip plane to
0 and look at floor/wall when using inventory.

I bought a Silver Swift Blade in Bazaar for 50pp 16/24 2hs Ranger only.
Haven't given it away yet, shame you're not on Bristlebane :ï¿½)
