I levelled him 3 weeks ago or so.  I accept hand me downs from any class
though, if I can't find a place for it on one of my twinks, I have plenty of
friends with twinks who could use it.  My latest project is a DE cleric, he
is level 8 now.  I may be adding him to my sig block soon, I'm having a lot
of fun killing halflings with him.
