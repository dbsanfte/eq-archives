Well what can l say about that...not much since l haven't really met alot of
female players in EQ.
Is there any difference across the servers?  I picked Bristlebane as it was
fairly quiet at the time
l signed up.
I have to agree when l have been on during the busier times there have been
a few whining about
not being able to get into groups and wanted to know about your RL identity
rather than just
enjoying the game.
