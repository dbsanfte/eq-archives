On Wed, 14 Aug 2002 10:53:07 -0400, a loud, wet, greasy cloud erupted
from the shorts of  Zardoz <zardoz@localdomain.invalid> . Smiling at
the crowd this rather unsavory individual proudly proclaimed:

hmmm...haven't thought of that.  I'll look into it.  With the Toshiba
video card however, it's proprietary so I'm limited to what I can do
with the drivers.  Maybe it's a bio's setting that needs to be
tweaked.  Laptops and their proprietary hardware can be a real
PITA sometimes.

Zardoz eh?  Gawd, that brings back memories...flying head and all.
