On my old work Latitude laptop, after installing directx 9 it fucked up 
Nvidia drivers.

Graphics lagged a lot, but if I refreshed video settings (resolution and 
such) graphics would run smooth.

I never found a solution (maybe avoiding dx9) since I turned in the laptop 
and installed a Radeon card on desktop.
