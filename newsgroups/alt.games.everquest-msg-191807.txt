Hi all,

If you don't have LoY installed do you have a copy of the following 
files on your computer;

http://eqlive.station.sony.com/lowsrc/community/dev_view.jsp?id=54541

If you don't then I downloaded LoY - I accidentally clicked on it trying 
to exit EverQuest a couple of days ago, then clicked madly for a couple 
of seconds trying to get out of it as I dont really require it yet and 
would have preferred waiting to get it in the shops here in Oz... Took 
me 4-5 hours to download via 56k modem.. (The patch wasn't that big - 
was it?)

If I do have a download of LoY and have been charged for it... how do I 
get my account key, etc, etc.?!

Thanks,

Matt
