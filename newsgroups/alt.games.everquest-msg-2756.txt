Nonsense - there are tons of ways to raise faction now.

Quickest way is to get stacks and stacks of treant wood shards by giving
small lanterns (lots of them) to Jyle Windshot in the Hogcallers Inn in
W Freeport (not the other Jyle Windshot), and give these to Emil Parsini
the woodcrafter in a hut in Tox just outside Erudin for lots of good
faction (Erudin Guards, Council of Erudin, and Erudin Merchants I
believe). He is supposed to accept 1 shard that you get for doing a
quest around Erudin and Qeynos, but the easier-to-get shards from Jyle
Windshot, who gives them out for the Trueshot bow quest, work just as
well. My druid gave him a few stacks and is now up from dubious to
amiable/warmly with pretty much all the merchants. Note you sometimes
get a treant heart from Jyle Windshot instead - if you keep it you'll
ensure you'll get nothing but wood shards in future, since its lore so
he can't give you another. That is for the trueshot upgrade I believe,
you can safely destroy it when you're done with all this, unless you're
a ranger who might need it.

Alternatively, kill Kobolds, both in Tox and in the Warrens for faction
with both good guys and heretics. Kill any Heretic NPCs for faction with
the weirder Erudin factions like the craftkeepers and gatecallers, and
corresponding negative hits with the Heretics - everyone's favourite
target for this being Elial Brook next to the jetty to the Kerran isle.
Turn in the bones you get from them to the head guy in the gatecallers.
Killing heretic prophets works too, although you don't get bones from
that.

Now, if only Cabilis were this simple...
