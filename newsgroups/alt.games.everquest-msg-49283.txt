Well, the thing is, EQ PvP is horrible and it would be very difficult to
overhaul it and make it a workable and balanced aspect of the game.  I mean,
not EVERYBODY thinks its horrible, but I think I'd be fair in saying that it
is the general concensus.

DAoC has much more than that going for it.  It is really a fabulous game.
If you like EQ, I'd go so far as to say "you owe it to yourself" or at least
"you'd be doing yourself a favor" to check it out.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm
not bashing EQ.  I've been an EQ fan since it hit the shelves and I don't
plan to cancle any time soon, but DAoC has definately learned from a few of
EQ's mistakes.

Best Regards
