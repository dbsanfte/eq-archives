Every EQ player I know is also playing City of Heroes. And everyone of 
them is raving about it.

WoW is probably not going to be out of testing and on the shelves until 
after the new year.

The number of cancelations has to dramatic for them to be taking this 
action. The tone of the cancelations I've been reading over the past few 
weeks has been very different from the old 'tempertantrum' type 
farewells. People seem to really be done with EQ on a large scale.

For the EQ players who aren't in the WoW beta, the most common plan is:

1) Go outside for the first time since the EQ beta, take a breath
2) Play CoH until WoW hits the shelves
3) WoW

Although, WoW sounds like it isn't the panacea that many were making it 
out to be now that the beta testers are banging on it.
