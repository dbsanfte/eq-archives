I've been to probably ever vendor in Shadow Haven.  I'm ASSUMING this is
where your friend went as well.

I found Mesmerization (level 16 AE mez, research only) on a vendor last
night.  That was the first one I've found in a week.

I have a feeling your friend happened by some vendors who were the
recipients of an INT caster who was cleaning out their bank.  If it was any
zone besides Shadow Haven speak up fast so I can go there...my mage and
wizard really need theirs. :)
