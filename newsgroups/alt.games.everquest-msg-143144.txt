I can't remember if I installed these upon reinstalling my OS or not. I will 
definitely check in to it. How important are they?

>Are you using the latest video card drivers?

I use the 30.82 Detonator drivers, that's the latest official release I got from 
the nVidia site.

I haven't done any BIOS updates since getting this board earlier this summer. 
I'll check the Asus site.

Apparently Windows downloads updates automatically and then lets me know when 
they're ready to install. While it can be a handy feature I've found that despite 
telling it to download only when the computer is not in use it downloads them 
whenever it feels like it.

I've never messed with any of this stuff, but here is what Sandra shows as being 
shared (maybe you can tell me what needs to be changed):

IRQ 16:
3COM 3C905B-TX
nVidia GeForce4 Ti4600
VIA Rev 5 or later USB Universal Bus Controller

IRQ 17:
Texas Instruments OHCI  Compliant IEEE 1394 Host Controller
VIA USB 2.0 Enhanced Host Controller

IRQ 19:
Creative SB Live! Series (WDM)
VIA Rev 5 or later USB Universal Bus Controller
WinXP Promise MBFastTrak133 Lite (tm) Controller

IRQ21:
VIA Rev 5 or later USB Universal Bus Controller
VIA Rev 5 or later USB Universal Bus Controller

I like computers a lot, but I've always been one to just buy things and use them 
as is hehe. I've never overclocked anything in my life.

Sandra reports that my BIOS doesn't support ACPI. I'll see if it changes that 
upon updating the BIOS (if there are any updates to be had).


Thanks for your help.
