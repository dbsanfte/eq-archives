OK I didn't want to keep posting about an OT subject but now I am
hooked so my apologies.

Do you keep the primary airtight?  With beer I usually risk
contamination and let it ferment in the primary with a sterile tea
towel strapped over the top to allow some airflow but the dust and
crap out.  Not scientific but I like the results better and I never
had a problem yet.
I'd be nerveous with this method if it has to stay in the primary so
long.  

Constant heat is no problem, I have a closet with a hot water heater
in it that stays at the perfect temp all the time, even in winter as
it is not on an outside wall.  I even monitor it with X-10 stuff but
that probably just set me up for some geek jokes.

Thanks all, now I just need a time machine.  2 years!!! WOW!
