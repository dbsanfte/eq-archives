Yes, someone did ask.  It was at the Fan Fare in San D.  They asked a GM and
2 Developers.  The answer was this, "Yes, we know about these things, but
don't tell us.  If you tell us, we have to fix them.  If you don't tell us,
and just use them, it is OK."  It happened in the first magic/casting
workshop.  I know because I was there, and got a different question
answered.
