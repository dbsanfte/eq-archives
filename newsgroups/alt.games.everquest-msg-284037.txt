Only clerics with over inflated egos get annoyed with this. I, for one,
am happy to have another healer slapping heals on my tank - needed or
not. Two heals are better than one.

Your heal was not wasted. You were casting the spell anyways.

Insulted?!? "Real" healer?!? May I suggested learning a little
humility? Based on the linup you described, the cleric - you - were the
most expendable member of that group. These days, a cleric is actually
a burden to many groups - normal LDoNs in particular. I am greatful for
any group I can get. It sounds to me like you have the opposite view.

That sounds like a very effective group for a normal LDoN. From you
later posts, you indicate that the group was held up by the druid's
going oom. Why? While far from dead weight (again, you - the cleric -
were the closest to dead weight in this group), the druid in your
lineup was not essential for success.

Never the less, if you feel the druid was a bad player, don't group
with them again.

Based on the linup, I would guess that pulling would have been the
group's undoing. You or the necro should probably have been the puller.
