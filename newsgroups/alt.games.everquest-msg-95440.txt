He's got a lot of information here, but it's kind of hard to read because he
insists on presenting it in full roleplay first person perspective, and
there's a lot of nonessential clutter getting in the way of the information.

Also, this is the guy that started that rumor of "The Great War".  Remember
that?  Where dragons and gods would attack all the cities, etc?  This makes
me take things he says with a big grain of salt.
