    Clarity shouldn't have feet, or it defeats the purpose of Clarity.
WhinyCasterPerspective: "Bard, stay here and play mana song plz. ANYONE
else, pull." That's not even getting into issues like bard aggro, which can
be pretty hefty.

    The difference being the adds all hate the person expected to deal with
them as they're incoming. It would be analogous to the ENCH pulling - your
mezzer is already highest on the hate list before stuff gets to camp, so no
attempts at mezzing without something beating you senseless for j00. Think
about why you have a bard in a group, as opposed to why you have any of the
tank classes you mentioned.

    If a bard isn't buffing the party you've lost out on the majority of
what a bard brings to a party that you'd want.
