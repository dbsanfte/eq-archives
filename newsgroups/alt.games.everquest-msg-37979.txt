See my response below to the level 19 rogue for places to hunt at your
level. Those are for groups, however. If you want to solo, and be safe
(and not bored waiting for your hundreds of hp to regen back), you
shouldn't be playing a warrior, sorry. Yeah, soAndSo is going to pipe up
and say "but I solo'd my warrior to 60!". Yay for you. As concerned as
this guy is for being SAFE, I don't think he should be trying to solo a
warrior. Play a necro/druid/shaman instead. Druids can solo very safely;
mine hasn't died soloing since getting SOW at 14 (except for trying to
take Webclaw Mudtoe solo at 25 - ok, that was a BIG mistake...). Necros
are pretty safe as well, with strong tanking pets and FD, but I think
the edge for safety goes to druids with SOW.
