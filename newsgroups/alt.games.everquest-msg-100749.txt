I do wish someone would take the time to pin down the
exact bonuses.  *cough*ShowEQ*cough*

For that matter, I don't understand why Verant doesn't
just come out and say what it is.  Like the previous
ZEM (Zone Experience Modifier) values, which were there
to make some zones more "exp-worthy" than others, and
thus entice people to come use them, much of the
incentive is lost if people aren't told what they are.

Well, yes and no.  You could get how many of mob type
"x" you killed at each level, which would help answer
some of the questions, but the big problem is that
some mob types range over several levels (i.e., 
a particular type of skeleton might spawn across
the range of levels 9-12).
