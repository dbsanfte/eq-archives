Martin, on the off chance that you're on Bertox and one of the five is
named Qween, please extend my thanks.  My beastlord was recently
waaaay out on the plains and was struggling to stay alive because so
many orcs were joining in the fray.  My dear warder, who takes such
good care of me, had already fallen when I noticed I was being
bandaged by an iksar unknown to me.

She graciously helped me when it was obvious I needed it.  She
patiently continued as I had to confront additional MOB's who had
wandered by.  She understandably wiped the plains with the last
couple to add, as it was obvious I'd not have been standing at that
point without her aid.  I'd have been embarassed by how quickly she
dispatched those against whom I'd been struggling, were it not for
the fact that she was level 60.    :-)

More likely is that she's not in your guild.  At least I have provided
here an anecdote demonstrating that one player of this race and
class is kind and generous, and feels rewarded for having helped
others.

By the way, I did thank her -- twice.

Faolann
