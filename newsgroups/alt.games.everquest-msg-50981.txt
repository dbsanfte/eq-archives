This spell lasts something like 2 hours.  Why the hell would you need
to keep it loaded?

This lasts 90 mins, see above.

>3)Resist magic (I hate root)

Again, not exactly something you need to cast during combat a whole
lot.  Even if you wanted it, you can collapse three of these spells
into one.

Wow, so you can't afford to sit and load a ring/circle spell so
absolutely need to keep gate and a ring/circle spell loaded at all
times.

Not a newbie, an idiot.

I guess the concept of loading only those spells you need to have when
you're unable to reload is a foreign one eh?

>I wont even start on my necro.... or wondering about shamans in parties.

Let me guess, your shamans keeps those 2+ hour lasting stat buffs
loaded all the time while swapping between your heal and slow spells
right?
