Wrong.  What is needed is not simply *any* question to the answer, but The
Ultimate Question to the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe, and
Everything.  "What is six times nine" might indeed be that Ultimate
Question, but currently favored philosophy would argue that it is not simply
because if it were, you would in fact know both the answer *and* the
question, which is supposed to be impossible by the laws regarding observers
and infinite knowledge.  This is not known to be a fact but there does
appear to be ample evidence of its validity.
