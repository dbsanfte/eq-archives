That was the Cleric tournament with the red and blue ogre knights.
Go and read the rules page about this one and it states that there will be
an NPC at each of the 4 torches in the corners and also one on each end of
the platform, which after a certain time limit NPCs will start spawing in
the center.  If the contestants step out of the center 4 tiles an NPC will
agro on them.
