Well those of course have the option to shut their account down get the
refund for unused time and come back later when they have upgraded as per
any shut down....the difference in the offer listed above is they will
refund the cost of the actual games bought recently as well. ie you are
chucking out any playing of EQ because they are buying back. SInce the
only way to restart then would be a new key, then its a new account.
