Because the 4 level difference in the pets makes a huge difference
in damage output.  Also, don't expect a 52 mage to use much else,
the 52 fire pet is crap.  It would be fine if stayed out of melee
and cast it's low level wizzie spells exclusively.  Instead, it 
wades in with about 60% of the melee damage of a 51 earth.  Until
53, earth is the best damage dealer a mage has, which stays that
way until 57 (Greater Vocerate Earth) *UNLESS* you can get your
hands on 54 water, and position it behind the mob well.  Then we're 
stuck with that one until 59 (Greater Vocerate Air).

For what it's worth, I *HATE* earth for soloing.  Only mages who 
can't manage aggro use mage root&nuke.  For soloing, Fire was my
pet of choice from 29 through 49.  Occasionally I'd use a focused
water pet (same hp as earth, better ac, no root).

When I make 56, Dyzils Decoy will be my pet of choice for soloing.
High HP, big DS, lower level and max damage than the vocerates, 
but that's not what you're after soloing.
