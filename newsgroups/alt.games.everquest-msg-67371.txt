 I was getting that a lot yesterday and I hope it's fixed. I eventually
was able to get around it by hitting ctrl-alt-del once. This would bring
up the loading screen as it should have. Sometimes when it went to go to
the character select it would be black. The only way out of that that I
could find was to reload.

 I'm not sure this is the same issue though as I was getting it even
after reboots. I was starting to think maybe I had some corrupted files
or something.
