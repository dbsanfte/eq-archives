This isn't quit true - in the days of Rubicite rangers were far from
underpowered - they tanked as well as warriors and had the utility of
spells to boot.  Then came the removal of Rubi and the addition of class
armor for all the classes that used to be able to use it.

My ranger buddy died quite often in our epic piece raids for a family 
guild: but that wasn't the fault of the ranger class, but rather because
we tried thing with fewer people and without "required" classes.  In
the eons since those days, we have died much less, but mainly due to our
druidess companion getting her "get out of jail free" aa (the insta evac). 

We still try to find ways to pare our forces down and still win: Ice and
Wind bosses in BoT dropped to a force of 19 yesterday.
