Yes - I have been thinking a bit more about about the issue and came to the
conclusion it wouldn't be a good idea. I may personally care about the
"pissing contest" so to speak, but enough other people do care about it to
start an exedous of sorts. That can't be good in anyones books.

Maybe it would be a good idea as a final grasp for cash when the game nears
the end of it's life expectancy and SWG and EQ2 are up and running. Wring
every last cent out of EQ and hasten the transition to EQ2 mayhaps?
