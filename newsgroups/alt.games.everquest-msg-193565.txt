Would like to increase AC and Poison/Disease/Magic resists without 
sacrificing HP, Dex or Fire/Cold resists too badly.

I'll probably be getting a tae ew chain tunic soon, so I've created an 
alternate profile with that in it called *gasp* Tae Ew Tunic.

To give some idea of where my guild is at, we're still trying to get people 
flagged for tier 2 planes.  I am not flagged yet, but should be 59 in about 
a week (will probably hit 58 tomorrow).

Thanks in advance.
