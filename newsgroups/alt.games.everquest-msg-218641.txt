Tedium surely isn't enough to call it a waste though, is it? Especially 
when you are in direct control of so many of the things that *make* it 
so?

Could be. I learned long ago that it's better to make an occasional wrong 
call than never any at all. If I missed it here, my apologies. I just 
feel that the thought of someone actually thinking it would be better for 
them never to have existed should be relegated to only the most tragic of 
circumstances. Not knowing yours, I played the odds.

I *am* curious now who Arya, Sansa, Robb, Bran, Rickon, Jon, and the rest 
are, though.
