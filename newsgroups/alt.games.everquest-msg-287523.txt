	I'd be glad to if I didn't need 50 other people to help.  I
don't mind tedious pointless busywork quests as much as I mind being
forced to beg acceptance into some kind of virtual country club to be
allowed to access game content my user fees support.

	I have.  I'd still like to see Time before they shut down the
last server.  And no, I don't want to join a guild.  If I liked company
I'd have been a cleric.
