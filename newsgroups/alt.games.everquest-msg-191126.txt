So me and my bro decided to go to castle mistmoore for the first time, =
him for the Cadecaus of Sacrement quest (some cleric hammer), and myself =
to get some drops from a deathly usher and a gargoyle for Ivy =
etched.......

We buff up, and enter, I scout a little...all nearby are green, but =
aggro, so we start taking them out (initiates and familiars).

Once the front is clear, my bro checks the map, we invis up and go to =
the graveyard, in the middle of the yard my invis drops and I get aggro =
from 3 guardians, (2 db 1 lb), I root one and get stuck in, my bro =
reappears behind me ready to heal, and I take them out with little =
problem, we then take out the other two guardians across the yard.

So now the yard is clear, my brother says to get the Icon he needs, we =
have to enter the structure in the graveyard (looks like a =
temple/vault), so we go in, he looks around...then I hear him fall.  =
Stupidly, I didnt even think about it or ask his situation, but just =
followed him straight away (I thought he could be in trouble, and didnt =
wanna leave him down there alone).  Of course, as soon as I went through =
and saw the pit I was in, I just thought...DOH! (damn cleric can gate).

So basically we are both now in this pit, with one exit through a secret =
wall which leads to the room my bro has to get his ingot from, so all in =
all we figured it wasnt too bad, so with much trepidation, we both buff =
up and proceed to the 'jail' room.

The info we have seen on this quest says the ingot/icon (sorry I forget =
which it was), is supposed to spawn in the centre of the room, well, it =
didnt.

For the benefit of anyone who hasnt seen this place before, there are =
four doors, three are cells, containing deathly ushers/caster, when you =
open the blank door, invis gets stripped and the three cells open.

Well we did this, and the funny thing was the ushers just didnt aggro, =
well they DID aggro but they hardly moved around, so dispatching them =
was no problem (they werent as tough as I thought they would be either =
way).

Anyway with these dead, we opened the doors again, I noticed something =
in the corner of the second cell, as did my brother, well, he ran in and =
picked it up, as soon as he did an usher spawned (it looked different =
from the others, to me), so I ran into the cell to assist the cleric =
which was my second stupid mistake in 20 minutes, we killed the usher, =
then looked around......we was in trouble, the room we were in was =
small...the door didnt open....we (or at least I, without gate) were =
stuck.

(with hindsight, with a little more research on the quest we would of =
known not to enter the cells (pretty obvious I guess but it was late :D =
).

We had a think and the best plan we could think of was for me to hide, =
him to camp his cleric out and log in his level 10 dr00d (who has invis) =
to come and try and rescue us.

So I sit down in the cell, and hide, and wait for his druid (I actually =
go into the other room and watch the druids journey through lesser =
faydark and castle mistmoore).  He was lucky as invis dropped in the =
middle of mistmoore but luckily he managed to get to an area away from =
any mobs and invis up again.

He made it through the graveyard and went down through the pit.=20

By this time, my ranger was in considerable trouble, stood not 1 foot =
away from me was A Shadowy Scrivener and I could hear another two close =
by putting up the absorb and damage shield.  So basically, as soon as I =
moved, this thing would start nuking me....I had no real choice or =
alternative way out, so I tell my bro to open the door, run down to the =
pit and camp out and log his cleric back in.

The doors fling open, I dont see my bro, I run out, luckily I only get =
'real' aggro from the Scrivener nearby to me, I run down into the pit =
and begin fighting it.  Well, this doesnt go too good, it chain casts me =
down to about 12%, theres not much I can do so I just root it on the =
ramp, go under where we fell in and mem heal, hit track and see Kikur =
(the cleric)....I start screaming for help, cowering in this pit certain =
that death it close, then I realise he is still in the cell, so I run up =
past the Scrivener, hit the door my bro comes out and heals me just as I =
resist another nuke, in total I resisted about 4 casts which definitley =
saved me.

But we were out, by hook or crook we had defeated this (fairly basic) =
trap, I invised up, went through the second secret passage in the jail =
room and found the exit (you can get out by jumping from the gangway =
that leads to the tower).  I tell my bro and we decide that now we know =
the place, and the exp is good, we will stay here for a while and at =
least get to 36.

My bro has his ingot, I have the mobs nearby to get my ivy stuff, so all =
in all it has worked out ok.

NB: The druid made it back fine, he camped out as soon as he hit the =
doors, after myself and the cleric camped, my bro logged him in and =
began exploring the castle, invised (he had left his items at home and =
had no real fear of death).  But he didnt die, he looked round most of =
the castle, exited through the front, ran through lesser faydark =
stopping to look in both the brownie camp, and pickin a few select =
mushrooms from the fairy camp before returning to his home in Gfay.
