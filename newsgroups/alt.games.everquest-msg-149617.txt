Heh firey gem of the underfoot, that's like the shining holy light of
hell. Underfoot is the earth plane what's a fire gem doing there? If
it has magic lore or nodrop on it I'd maybe save one just in case but
otherwise if it's good for pp at merchants then equip your CHA armor
or get a CHA buff and sell away. Well if it's no drop i guess you
couldn't sell it but if it's lore hand it off to a newbie mule type
person until later.
