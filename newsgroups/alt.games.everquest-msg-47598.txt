Make sure you have the latest version of DirectX that they game requires. I
just assembled a new computer, brough over my EQ folder from the old
computer, ran the game, and.....ended up on the desktop. When I had
installed the drivers for my video card, I had neglected to install the DX
8.0a drivers that came with them and was running whatever version of DX that
comes with Win98SE. Installed the DX 8.0a and the problem was gone.

Depending on how long you have not been playing, this may solve the problem.
Otherwise, I will leave it to wiser minds than mine.

Either way, good luck.
