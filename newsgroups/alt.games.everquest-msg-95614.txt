So I'm finally high enough level to start worrying about getting my Seb key.
I know I have to get the drops from the Froglok Hunter and Froglok Forager.
I was doing some research on Allakhazam to see what kind of things I was
going to be up against and what kind of group I should bring with me when I
go to start killing these things, and while I was looking at some of the
other mobs that are in the zone, I keep seeing posts about these mobs being
"on the hunter/forager cycle".

I know this may be a stupid question, but what is the hunter/forager cycle?
I'm seriosly missing somethign because this has got me very confused.

Any info would be appreciated.
