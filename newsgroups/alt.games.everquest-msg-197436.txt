To stack with the FBSS you would need a weapon that could
cast a spell or song haste. To the best of my knowledge there
is not such thing. There is an item, "eyepatch of plunder" 
which I think has spell haste on it though.

The monk epic does the same, and there's probalby one or more
strange bardic items, but they're class restricted of course.
