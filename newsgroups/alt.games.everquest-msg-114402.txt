So i am trying to raise my alco. tol. and noticed i am getting none to few
skillgains lately.
This has made me wonder about skillgain on AT skill. Does anyone have any
info or
have someone gathered it on a website somewhere (tried looking at EQTraders
and such
 to no avail.
What i am wondering is, does AT base it's skillgain on INT/WIS, in that case
drinking only little amounts
at a time would be beneficial as drinking lowers those stats. And does
drinking different
beverages have any effect, ie. stronger drink better skillgain at higher
skill-lvls?
And if so is there a list that shows potency of different beverages
somewhere?
