Jim, while I think neither of you broke the rules as they exist, I think you
game closer to breaking the "rules of a gentleman" than they did. In fact, I
think you probably did. Here's why:

I find it curious that you were immediately suspicious of cheating. Even
worse, you just about accused the guy of doing so to his face, which is
rather rude and certainly not very nice. You had no *good* reason to believe
he had done so. You just did.

Honestly, after a guy semi-accused me of that, I wouldn't be too eager to
give up a camp for him either.

And this comment was rather a slap in the face, wasn't it? It's very "Nyah!
Nyah!" in tone.

But at least you show you have a heart, which is good ...

I think he was in the right, to a large extent. If I'm waiting for a camp
and the player with the camp is repeatedly going LD, I'm certainly not going
to sit around for hours while he fights, goes LD, comes back, and so on.
I'll either move in when the next lengthy LD occurs, or, far more likely,
move on. But you were essentially logged, though through no fault of your
own, and left the camp open. Would it have been any different if it were
*not* the player waiting for the camp?

Not irrelevant at all. He should have /reported you for the threat

Maybe. But telling somebody "Nyah Nyah, I have your camp" and accusing them
of messing with your game is ruder still.

I hate to tell you, Jim, but based on your description, it's *you* I'd be
avoiding, not the other fellow. The fact that you're concerned is a good
indication, however ... until this other post of yours:

You're a jerk who ought to be banned from the game. Period. I don't care
what anybody has done to you. Banned.

You wanted an opinion. There's one.
