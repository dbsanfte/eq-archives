<<<while in ssra the other day i was doin the arcanists and things and the
snake like shissar in ssra, they are massive, jus before we entered the tube
there is a small hallway, door on the far right hand side after the
entrance. (we were making our way to comm2 at this point). in this small L
shaped corridor we had a great monk singling the pulls and we were doing
well, but i noticed that i could stand against the back of the wall, while
the mob was near the door, all the time, still hitting the mob and not be
prone to riposits and the alike, while our tank happily beat upon the fucker
until it was dead. Im using a Great Lance of Grief, now this fucker is BIG
and i mean MASSIVE. Remember those old films about camelot, its a fuckin
joustin lance>>>

Yes I know of the weapon, anyone wielding it looks like they should be
standing at the Entrance/Exit of a Car Park waiting for the toll to be payed
before raising the barrier. I have never found a place where I could hit a
mob and it couldn't hit me, always the reverse. As you descibed just one
event I wonder if what you found was more of a bug in the zone layout than
anything else.
Try it with Giants and Brutes (especially) these are giant mobs and
certainly get a reach advantage over you (and at your level they will hit
you but not be much of a threat other than that) then try it with something
goblin sized, have it rooted and see if you have range over it in
melee...I'm willing to bet you don't....Even with that Toll Barrier you are
carrying ;ï¿½)

PS..Please post in plain text.
