You see, there are these things that some people call "jokes." Strangely
enough, some people find the need to laugh at things... stay with me on
this, it's hard to understand for me, too.

These "jokes" induce laughter. Now this is beyond me, but some people like
to laugh at things. Also, some people find different things amusing. Some
people like satires, such as the ones that William Shakespeare is known for
and others like the dark humour of Denis Leary. I happen to like both. (For
the sake of length, I will not list other styles that people like.)

Now, I can tell how you would be mislead by my comment about people
irradiating themselves, and thus be confused to think that I was serious. I
mean, we all know how common radioactive waste is as a household commodity,
so I have taken this oppurtunity to educate you on the concept of jokes.

Joke -
(1a) something said or done to provoke laughter; especially : a brief oral
narrative with a climactic humorous twist
(1b) the humorous or ridiculous element in something

There's always one over-sensitive person that just gets so easily
offended...

> Yeah, I'm a bit offended, you creepy fucktard.

It's nice to know that someone I don't care about regards me not only as a
fucktard, but as a creepy fucktard. Finally, my life has meaning.
