I thought that too about Lavastorm, but it's not really true.  Most of the
mobs I have seen there are not summoned, I tried using the spells vs
summoned on them.  The Rock Dervishes are not summoned, I don't think the
Sprites are(I don't remember for certain if I tried the spells on them), the
Crawlers are not.  The only ones I ran into that were summoned, were the
fire elementals.  The Fire Elementals would be too low for him.  Najena has
a fair amount of elementals in it, but again, all too low I think.  I don't
know about SOl A or B.
