Downtime warrants the term "excessive" only if you view EQ solely as
an arcade shoot-em-up (or chop-em-up I guess).  Roleplaying games
are social vehicles, non-stop action is completely anti-social.  EQ
started out trying to be a role-playing game, but a large number of
raised on TV, gratify me now!, sorts joined and demanded that the
whole game be refocussed around the small portion of it that they
thought was most fun... SOE went where they saw the money, those of
us that preferred things otherwise don't have a whole lot we can do,
except complain about what we don't like and lobby for what we do
like.  It's pretty fucking hypocritical for members of the "winning"
faction to bitch about our complaints when it was their complaints
that fucked the game up (from our POV).  Understandable, defending
your position by attacking your enemies for using the same tactics
you used is a time-honored political/social behavior, but still as
hypocritical now as it has ever been.
