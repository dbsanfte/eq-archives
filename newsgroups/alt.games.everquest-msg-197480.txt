I guess I fall strongly into the "Battlecleric" mold - in small groups
clerics often find themselves the centre of attention for adds and so
on because of heal aggro. I'd like to know that even though I can't
really dish out the damage (until I get my proccing hammer), I
certainly can take it. It means I get missed a lot. Or get hit for
less - you know the mechanics.

Yes, I am beginning to find my resists are falling behind, and
especially for dragon or epic raids I know they are critical, so I use
all that lovely extra bank space to hold pieces of resist gear I can
swap to.

I have a strange set of play times, so often find myself online at
quiet times. I have spent a LOT of my levels soloing or in small
short-duration groups, so I like to know I am relatively
self-sufficient. It is only really after about level 53 that I found
soloing *very* slow going (working Ship1 or the end of the pier of
ship 3 in dulak at the moment), but believe me, standing there with
1070ac and 2800hps watching a mob ripping itself to tiny bits on MoR
is a real buzz - I can tank one of the darkblue trollies with MoR,
PetHammer and just one or 2 CelHeals and take it out, having used
about 20% mana

Regarding the 2hb question - in a small group I sometimes find myself
above 80m and all members with stable hps, so I swap out my Club of
Ice Ocean and Shield of Bane Warding for a Tae Ew Maul of Aggression
(20 delay, good for skillups, will replace as soon as 2hb is maxed)
and start clobbering - as soon as mana drops below 80, I'm back on my
butt being a good little dwarfy cleric. I know there are some nice 2hb
out there (or at least according to Allahs) but haven't got a good one
yet. In groups where mana fluctuates, I wouldn't dream of standing and
hitting.
