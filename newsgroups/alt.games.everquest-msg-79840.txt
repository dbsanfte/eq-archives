Having played DAoC for 3 months I would have to disagree with this. The 
difference I found between DAoC and EQ (just joined EQ) is that EQs 
world is believable. The landscapes are varied the towns actually towns. 
In DAoC the capital is a city and thats it other towns are  4 or 5 huts 
per town. I played in two realms Hibernia and Midgard as well as playing 
on the beta server as part of the beta group.

DaoC maybe the future, but the future in terms of interface. It really 
rocks for the interface but even that once you get used to EQ you start 
to prefer/like its interface. The only part I still dislike is EQs chat 
interface. DAoC wins that hands down. Always missing chat.

RvR I never got into. I was in a mailgroup that had some high level 
chars and it appeared to me that if you were an archer then you had a 
big advantage. Any other char was determinant on the level you were at 
who would win.

 From the start in DaoC it just seemed to be a level fest. I would end up 
spending ages near major camping spots. Sure EQ is similar on the 
leveling, but I have found I have not spent half as much time leveling. 
I'm going back to the towns exploring  finding new things, chatting with 
the npcs.

As someone said previously however if you love DAoC and hate EQ thats 
great. The same goes for loving EQ and hating DAoc its all possible we 
all have our game styles which will suit the different games.

I still love UO - I guess thats my problem ;)
