Ooo, and if I could bother yous all one more time: piercing weapons.  Saw a
Grimling Mining Pick once with a piercing damage of about 10(ish) - but I
couldn't afford it at the time..

Months and months ago, a kindly dude called Cigwacko sold me a Bloodstained
Fang and a Walrus Tusk which have been an enormous improvement, but I'd
still like to improve on them if at all possible.  Now, I'm beginning to
accept that I'm never going to see level 12 for more than the 30 seconds
Lars Bloody McMannus allowed me to stay there last night before hacking me
to pieces just for the heinous crime of walking past him (sodding Wolves of
the North...  Prejudiced, Racially-Bigoted Hateful Arseholes of the North,
more like; present company excepted, naturally)...  So I know I'm hardly
likely to see dual wield any time soon, much less double attack (I've been
top end of level 11 for four weeks)...  But I'd still like to upgrade.

Wondered if anyone had any suggestions for the best piercing weapon I could
expect to find and how I might get hold of it?

Thanks.  Sorry.
