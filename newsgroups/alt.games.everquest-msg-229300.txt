I've seen that movie.

We were doing well in a Mistmoore LDoN when we ran into a wanderer.
We were beating on it, everything was going fine, when it suddenly
Gated.  If I'd have thought, I'd have shouted *then* for everyone to
run.  But no, nobody thought.  Instead, we're standing around getting
cleaned up when suddenly we get a wave of mobs coming around the
corner.  I shouted RUN, but it was already too late.  Half the group
never had a chance.  My pet bought me enough time for me to FD.  I
think 2 people made it out ahead of the mobs.  Me, I sat there under
FD, all nice and dead, and waited while the mobs trickled back past
me.

And no, I didn't feel guilty at all.
