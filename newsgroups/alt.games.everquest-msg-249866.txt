Land Sharks mean you are not close enough to the water.  In some zones I
find that I have to actually be standing in water, without swimming, to
fish.  Zones that have docks usually don't have this problem.  In Abysmal
Sea, have your char look straight down and move forward, when you can only
see water, cast your rod.
