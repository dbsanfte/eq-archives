And you know this how?

I play a high level character on Lanys, I know several Conquest members,
and I've read a lot of message board and newsgroup posts about it.

And I don't know whether Conquest:

- were deliberately exploiting a bug

- were accidentally getting benefit from a bug without realising it.

- were unaffected by a bug which may or may not exist at that spot.

So, do you work for Verant? Or were you one of the 26 players in zone?
Or are you talking out of your ass?

Richard
