I think Verant needs to read this article about a recent court decision that
ruled in favor of free speech, and peoples first amendment rights to
criticize companies. (and this was even in California)

Several months ago Verant banned my account because of being critical of
Verant on their message board.  It doesn't matter what their little EULA
says, FACT is, and LAW is, that its illegal.

Please move back to China, Verant.  You will be right at home there.
