Yes, this is sometimes how it goes, so far my shaman has been the worst for
this, often not getting spells until far past that level (/wave primal
essence (rare case)).  Another example, I saw Pox of Bertoxulos (spl) for 7k
in bazaar, this is a level 59 shaman disease dot (roughly 110 per tick).
For a spell of its usefulness (ie, not very high), 7k is an insane price,
torpor only cost me 5k ffs (VS spell prices are different from most others I
think).

So basically, look in bazaar, buy it if the spell is there AND not priced
insanely high.  Failing that, find out how to make the spell via research,
then get any INT caster with 200 research to make it for you.  Failing that,
go to a place with a high density of mobs which have a chance of dropping
the spell you want (seb, GD), kill said mobs until it drops.  Yes it is a
pain, yes others have to do it too :)

Another couple of spells that will likely annoy you are Levitation and
Everlasting breath, I got them cheap in the end but for what they do, what
you have to do to get them is insane.
