I would put either a chanter or a rogue.

Rogue cause when a nec. fear and darness it is great to have a rogue for
backstabbing and fast kill.

A chanter is always nice for buffs anc Mezz.

Your role as a necro becomes more and more, you could solo most mobs when
you gain lvl. But you should all figure out what your best at. At lvl 9 a
cleric can help you fear, sometimes a necro are the groups puller cause he
can pull with darkness, but beware. I will add more info later.
