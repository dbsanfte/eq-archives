    Against raid mobs, DoTs are fine. They last to full duration and deal
all their damage. It's trash mobs, like the kinds people XP off, that are
the issue. If your target is dying before your DoT has even hit normal full
duration, much less extended full duration, then that fancy Extended
Affliction focus is worthless. When my necromancer is killing plaguebone
thieves, for example, I never get full duration on Eternities Torment (21
ticks). So the extra four ticks that her Bone-Clasped Girdle give are
wasted. (Eternities Torment is disgustingly good, BTW. 140 mana for 630
damage in two minutes, -100 resist mod is high enough that I've never seen
it resisted, with AE and EA foci it's 105 mana for 750 damage in 2.5
minutes.)
