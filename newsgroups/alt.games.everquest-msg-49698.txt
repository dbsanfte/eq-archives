Yes, thats all I need to know in order to answer you.

Kill anything you want.   None of the quest armor can be achieved solo.  A
single group of 55 plus can survive in the Kael Arena area for Thurgadin quest
drops, but other than that, and even considering that, quest armor is a multi
group event.

You might be able to do the early stages of the Coldain Shawl quests, but even
getting to the good ones there... same thing.
