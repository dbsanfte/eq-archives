You can do it without DA at all.  You find the spot in Paineel where two 
surfaces meet to form a joint in the cliff.  Have a levitate on, step 
backwards, look up, move towards the wall, keep on that crack.  After 
zoning in, keep trying to move towards the wall.  Not guaranteed to work, 
so be sure to have the DA jumpers available as well.
