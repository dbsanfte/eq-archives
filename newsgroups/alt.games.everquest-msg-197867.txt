actually i was kind of being sarcastic.
though im sure that under that gruff exterior lurks a genuinely likeable
individual.
i am interested in your abrasive philosophies though. how does such irate
confrontationalism (to coin a phrase, its almost like im channeling george
bush jnr), as if you were suffering incessantly from the most vicious PMS,
contribute to your progress through life and your sense of overall
wellbeing? dont you really just want a big strong man to take care of you :)
