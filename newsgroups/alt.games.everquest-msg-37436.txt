    I do, from token amounts when I'm happy to "bleed 'em dry" when I'm in a
bad mood and being asked to go to the moon and back (soon enough, I fear)
for a res. Let's compare.

    So in some way you use "whatever you think is fair" as a pressure tactic
to extort more money from the now-guilty customer. I know you don't intend
that, but try and put yourself in the other person's shoes once or twice and
feel the pressure mount after someone says that to you. How much is "fair"?

    That does surprise me. In my experiences as a resser, if you didn't ask
for payment you'd never get it. Too many people think that spells are
something that makes one part of the Customer Services staff. The people
that DO pay never make up for this unless they make an absurd initial offer
out of desperation.

    There is: YOUR time. Some people price spells by how much it costs them
to cast it - is it very little mana, do I have to come to you or will you
come to me, etc. Others use a more aggressive scheme - what does the savings
in time to YOU get you in terms of cash, and what percentage of that do I
deserve for saving you that time cost? Some folks do this implicitly - they
charge a lower level player less.

    Now, given this outlook - I'll res you if I become a partner in whatever
you'll do with the time I save you - you can begin to understand 1 pp for a
SoW, 10 pp for a 'port, 100 pp for a res. A res saves someone a large amount
of time (as they go up in level), and during that time they can do some very
profitable things like farming.

> but "pay me 100p or no rez for you!" is just being a greedy asshole.

    People throw around the term "greedy" - like in the above, in "need
before greed" looting, and so on. It's a game in which I can spend my time
however I wish - no matter HOW I do so, I am NOT being "greedy". I may be
foolish in placing my cost for services above what people can pay without
holding a grudge, but I'm not greedy.

    And on my server, 100 pp is considered the "normal" cost for the 49th or
higher res.
