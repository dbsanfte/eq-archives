No DS?  No haste?  What sort of charm kiter are you!  Buff your poor pet up, you know a
buffed tank is always the most efficient use of mana.

I have to admit, every character that I play dedicates one slot to a "get out of jail
free" card of one kind or another at almost all times, so I can't really call you out on
Egress.

Since people will be training to the zone out, the people who need to learn how to behave
are the people at the graveyard.   I know this is cruel, but its a fact of life; the
graveyard is a dangerous place to be.   In PON, go up the hill to wait for rez, when your
body pops, take a good look around before clicking yes to accept rez, then move back up
the hill or even zone out while you wait for rez to wear off.  Don't loot your body until
you can move with your gear on.  Adjust.

The people who have a right to complain about training are the people who zone in into
one.  They had no opportunity to look around to see if its clear.  Sadly, though, for them
this is also a fact of life.  Zone in eyes open and with a plan, because there may well be
several mobs running around the graveyard looking for a new target.  Get SOW and be ready
to beat feet!

As would zoning out.  I know few druids these days who use wolf form, despite the added
mana, most seem to feel that having SOW on all the time is better than having wolf form on
except right after zoning.  If using Egress a lot, then this would be a far stronger
incentive to stay SOWed.

I do recall some posts by someone who swore by his pet rat Scruffy.   And I do recall some
of the rats in POD kicking some serious butt... "feeble" my aunt fanny, I think I said.
In general, POD is a lower level zone than PON, based on my bard's track while going in at
46, 48, 50, 52... I didn't have precise levels of course, but things lit up (almost) all
red at 46 in PON while in POD there were blues and even cons galore.  Of course deeper in
to POD there are still a wealth of red to me mobs at 54 and 55, but by then I was leveling
at the castle courtyards, and I don't think you are likely to bring rats in to take on
lightcrawlers.
