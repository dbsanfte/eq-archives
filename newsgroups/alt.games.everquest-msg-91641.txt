Amen to that sister. I am 39 and have DMed for years, and I was always of
the earn-it-the-heard-way school. (+1 sword at lvl 10 is a little extreme...
:-)   )

Legends seems like a place for pabulum players to be, to be coddled. My
characters on EQ are untwinked and if I have a magic anything its cause I
killed it, looted it and ate its leftovers.

These guild / Legends uber twinkers sicken me, especially when they are
mouthy or braggy.  Great - so you cheated or pabulum-ed your way to the top.
