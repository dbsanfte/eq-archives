Eating a food normally gives you x minutes until you eat something
again, at which point you eat whatever is most upper/left in your inventory.

"Force feeding," which is clicking on a food item in a general inventory
slot, will give you x/2 minutes till you eat again naturally.

There is a "I'm too full to eat" cap, say Y.  I'm not sure how this works,
though, basically you force feed yourself (taking x/2+x/2+x/2) till you
hit it.   Your fullness total drops by a tiny fragment per interval, so you
still will eventually drop  down to eating something unless you keep
force feeding.

What I've done is put empty inventory slots (no container) in the 7 and 8
positions, and tie the right and left arrows to them on my normal operating
hotkey pages, then I drop Fish Rolls and Fuzzlecutters in those two
slots, so I eat as soon as I can and drink as soon as I can, until those
slots
empty out.  Since they sit on my hotkeys, I can see how low I am and
make sure I get something else in there, even if its summoned food and
drink, to keep full.  In a raid with a dispeller, I pull out the
Fuzzlecutter
and drop in my spyglass so I'm constantly refreshing my insta-click, harder
to replace misty picnics than kaladim constitutionals.
