Go to Timorous Deep and find the raptor island.  They can be a bit difficult
at first, but once you get the hang of it, the experience will be worth it.

If you're willing to take slightly slower experience with significantly
lower risk and stress, once you're high enough level to be able to single
pull in PoJ, you could try single kiting around the exit area.  I'm told the
magic level for this is 55, but I was already past that when I first went.
Anyway, it's very strange how agro works in there.  If you're below the
cutoff level, you'll get assist agro, whether standing or sitting, from
everything that sees you fighting.  Once you pass the cutoff, you can root
and med, and the rats and guards can walk right over the top of you without
getting angry.  At that point, the only thing that will agro you in the exit
area while you fight is the Iksar prisoner, and he's easily enough dealt
with or avoided.

I alternated between the two places up to 60, though the raptors go largely
cyan by then.  Everything except the exit area rats and prisoners in PoJ are
still dark blue or better, and by that time, I'd graduated to the second
floor.

Good luck to you.
