The concept is word of mouth, especially with expansions.

You didn't buy PoP.  Your friend did and gets a grind group in PoV and sends
you a tell, "Dude, the exp here is amazing!"

Are you more likely to buy PoP after that?  Hell yeah, it was a positive. 
It doesn't have to be the main reason you want the expansion, but it is
another positive on the list.
