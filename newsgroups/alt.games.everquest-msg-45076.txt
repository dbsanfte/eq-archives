They don't. Luclin is not even really connected it would seem and you
will be able to get to luclin from various wizard teleport spires,
every 45 minutes. Presumeably you also will be able to with ports as
per usual. 

The new "auction" zone is going to be in Luclin, no more than 3 zones
away from any zone in the world roughly which makes me think you can
from ANY wizard spire thing.
