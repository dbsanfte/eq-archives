I usually donate 3-5 pp for sow/bind and 10-? for a port (depends on
what it takes to bribe some one to port me, and yes I realize that
druids/wizards aren't here for others taxi service, but it still sucks
when you need a port and can't find one until you offer like 100pp and
suddenly everyone wants to port you, hence the stereotypes of porters
being greedy)
