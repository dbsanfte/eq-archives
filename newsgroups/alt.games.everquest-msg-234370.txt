Yes, but it doesn't result in a life threatening situation where most
everyone dies quickly like the original post. If I read it correctly, you
root everything then start nuking as a solo.

It would take a tank that keeps in the middle of a group of rooted mobs
instead of taking a step back when they are parked. The roots would break
over time and there should be plenty of time for
Tank: HEAL!
Cleric: oom
Tank: WTF!!11
Before all 4 mobs get on loose.

All bets are off if you find 2 people who are tactically challenged to group
with. You could have the greatest 4 groupers who ever played the game and
get them all killed with 2 idiots.

I was pretty sure charmed pets can stun from behind which breaks up the
quad. I'll have to double check.
