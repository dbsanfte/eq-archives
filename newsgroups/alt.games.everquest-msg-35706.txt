Unexplained faction hits.  If you get a faction message, and
you didn't kill the mob, or aren't very sure who did kill it
and why, then it -may- be time to zone.  If you get a second,
a third... well, thats your call.

This lesson gets hammered home in LOIO at the sarnak
fortress.  Somehow one sarnak gets you on his hate list,
and he hands it around to the other sarnaks he passes.
Those faction messages are from people killing sarnaks
you never saw at all, probably on the far side of the
fortress... because eventually every sarnak in the place
has an APB out with your picture on it.  Doesn't sound too
bad, except that this vastly increases their aggro range
for you, so that the wanderers who normally give you
a miss instead come a running and bringing their big brothers.

Just as bad for this behaviour are the snow cougars in
Iceclad... but they don't have faction, so there's no message
to warn you.  If a cougar ever gets away from you in that zone,
its time to zone or log out, unless you feel like dealing with
six at once and more adding on.
