Gee....  imagine that!  Hmmm...  don't they sell these games to consumers?

Now you've shown just how wrong you are...  Many of us have "changed"
something about it.  Like cancelling both my eq accounts, not falling for
sony's crap a second time around with eq2, and subscribing to WoW!  Oh, yea
I two boxed.  That avoided paying a death pealenty because of stupid people
doing stupid things.  Ring a bell there?

No, actually they think "Perhaps I should be able to access and play a game
I'm paying to play when I want and am able to play".  The mind is a terrible
thing to waste...  good to see not everyones guilty.  lol   Stay in
eq/eq2...  you seem to love sony so much it would be a shame to breakup such
a wonderful love affair.
