   No complaining?  What channel are you hanging out in?

   Just for the record, I was never in danger of being disguilded, I was
going to leave in disgust.  I know you didn't say that I was, but I just
wanted clarify. 

   One thing a guild is also good for is corpse runs in nasty areas, and
other rescues as needed.  My guild has come through for Lenny and I more
than once.

Yes, it is.  I really like FV, but I'm too much of a ditz to not have
several characters.  So I also play on test, one of the Euro servers,
and one of the zeks, from time to time.  serverwide.age:age doesn't work
on test, but other than that, it is nice to familar people to chatter
with.

Annie <--- Likes low populations servers.
