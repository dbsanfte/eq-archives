Enough good advice already in the other two posts I see...  a couple more
things:

On any raid, follow the instructions of the leader to the letter, assuming
they're experienced, which it sounds like they are.
They may tell you to do something strange, but there's probably a reason for
it you don't know about.

For example-  in Hate you may have a spell cast on you called Gravity Flux.
It basically throws you up into the air and lets you fall back down to the
ground.  If this happens, chances are you must CAMP.  Immediately.  Everyone
who was thrown up into the air must camp.  Why?  Chances are pretty high
you've aggravated the very high level critters that reside on the second
floor, which you got near when you hit the ceiling.  So if you don't camp,
you may get some very nasty unexpected visitors very soon after...

If a critter rampages, generally you should stop physically hitting it
unless you are the main aggro tank.  Rampage = auto riposte every attack
from everyone!

Be patient.  Raids can take All.  Day.

The toughest parts of a raid are either the initial break-in, or the big
baddies.  Expect multiple deaths.  Do not whine.

Do your homework, and study info on the net on the plane before you go, know
your enemies.  The raid leaders can't answer
constant questions on things that people can find out for themselves.  Or
perhaps ask your group leader if you have questions.

Oh yeah, and have fun :)
