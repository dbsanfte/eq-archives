Head to the moon. The bandit camps in Paludal Caverns will carry you
all the way to level 23 very quickly. When I was there as my BL, that
was the fastest I'd ever gotten from 15-23. They do drop some loot,
but not a lot. Mostly gold, and every now and then 1 plat and some
change. But after that you can go hunt fungoids in Netherbian, and
they drop up to 4pp each. Plus there's that awesome bonus for being in
an indoor zone in both places. You'll be 30 in no time!
