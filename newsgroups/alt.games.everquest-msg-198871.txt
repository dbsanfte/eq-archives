Since there's no FFA PVP in SWG, *and* you can only target "overts" or
people who have gained a TEF somehow, *and* since there's no "levels"
in the game, I call "bullshit".

In fact, the main complaint on the discussion boards for SWG is from
the usual hack&slash fanatics who whine the game will be too
"carebear", precisely because they *can't* just open fire on any
newbie they see. 

So, I call "double secret bullshit".
