What people don't seem to realize is that Blizzard maintains a P2P network.
They host your game-matching services, but as soon as you're in-game,
they're no longer needed. Basically, a glorified chat room.

EQ has to track player information (stats, position, equipment, what spells
are mem'd, what has the player on its aggro list, what is the player
targetting, what is the player's level, hp, mana, what items do they have in
their inventory, what is the status of each item, etc.) It's a lot more
work, and thus a lot more money to do EverQuest hosting than it is to host
Battle.Net
