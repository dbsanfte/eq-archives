Just like to point out how DAMAGING it can be to a guild to expect
this (teleporting).

A druid might be able to teleport. A druid might be doing nothing. If
that is the case, the druid would probably be nice enough to teleport
guildies.

But just because it is POSSIBLE for the druid to teleport someone in
the guild doesn't make them entitled to it!

When my druid joined a guild I was quite happy to do ports at first.
But the requests never slowed down. They kept coming, and coming.
People are fucking lazy. I got asked by a guildy to do a port from SRo
to Feerrott. I nearly tore his head off. People would say they were at
a portal only to be a zone away when I get there, or hunting
something, or making a trade.

My own warrior main the time before didn't beg for rides like that. If
I wanted to get somewhere, I walked unless someone was already going.

So I started outright refusing to port anyone unless I wasn't actually
doing anything at all at the time. But if I was running to a hunting
spot, or already at one, or doing something I wanted to do, I would
outright refuse to port. I would almost never bind myself for other
people's convenience. And even if they meet all these standards, I
expect them to BE at the druid ring. Not at Sebilis, that is not a
druid ring (before the kunark evacs were changed, this was my biggest
beef). Not just in zone, at the ring.

The only exception was for CR.

Does that make me an obnoxious unhelpful druid? Maybe. But its the
obnoxious ungrateful nonporters who made me that.
