Actually, under 10 I think it's easy to twink a caster better than a
melee ("easy" would exclude the far extreme of a fungi, for instance).
Readily available caster armor and that moldy old dragoon dirk, along
with some cheap/easy mana and hp gear, will let the caster fight
nearly as well as a melee, and that's _without_ casting.  Throw in a
pet and a melee can't compare under L10.  The melees catch up thru the
teens tho, and by L20 when the damage cap comes off twinked melees can
far surpass their untwinked brothers (and the casters) with readily
available gear that's easily affordable for any 45+ main who has even
the first clue how to raise cash.
