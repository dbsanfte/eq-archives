in Split paw just the other night, i cleric joined our group after his group
disbanded. he said he would fight with us while a GM was coming to help.
there was one of his buddies corpses stuck half in a wall in plain sight of
him yet he couldnt click on it or target it in anyway. Gm comes in and SHE
cant click on or target it and she says she cant use her Rez thing since she
is only a guide or some excuse. out of the 6 people in the room. 4 could see
it but not click on it. 2 couldnt even see it.  and only I could target it.
so i got the corpse guys consent and started hauling his corpse out to the
zone line. they all followed. still same problems. finally we had to get the
cleric to target me and /assist to be able to use his rez. all this for a
simple rez job.
