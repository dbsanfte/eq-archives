I'm looking for a certain type of liquor in a black bottle with probably
purple type that seems to exude a sense of evil, an evil of eldritch dark
power that glows purple and surrounded by light grey and black and smells of
musty grave mold and unspeakable mystery and horror, of a past remembered
yet forgotten where time stands still and the only thing to be seen is death
at the hands of vengeful shadows for whom death is the same as their life
which was as if a judgement declaring them insane and in shadow had been
given them for just wanting to be happy and with other people which is crazy
according to this world's current revision version which is about to change
and already has even if you haven't.
