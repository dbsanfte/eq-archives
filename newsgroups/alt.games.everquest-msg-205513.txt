Aye in that group, I'm just saying we didn't have a pulling class... ranger,
monk, SK, druid... heck, paladin or cleric, anyone that could reliably bring
back -one- mob at a time instead of two or three.  Warrior and puller are not
words that go together in my mind.  I suppose others say the same about clerics
though.

Although I've heard such things many times, I haven't observed it.  I slow 99%
of the mobs I encounter, solo or grouped, and it rarely causes aggro, even more
rarely does it cause aggro that my pet can't get back off, and if it -does- I
can always root and lose aggro that way.  POP means I can't use my normal plan
of channeling those spells, but in POD there's ample room to play keepaway.  In
fact I was in a group in PON earlier where we used Hate kite the whole time,
whoever got the mob chasing them just kept moving while the others cast, until
aggo moved to the next person or the mob decided to run away.

Hate isn't necessarily the enemy; indoors it can be a very bad thing, but
outdoors, its actually a tool in the hands of a skilled party.

Since I've soloed and grouped in POP with a bard from 46 to 57, and grouped with
the shaman on and off from 46, I have to disagree.  Mobs ranging blue to yellow
that are killable within the mana/HP loads of a party seem quite reasonable prey
for that party.  The zones are coded to let people in at 46.  I'd be quite
amused to see tier one closed to people over 52, like Vox/Naggy are... go
somewhere challenging!  But the truth is, when you move in past yard trash the
zones can be challenging all the way up to the low 60s, with high end encounters
going even harder than that.

Chardok is plenty hard, I agree... but I think in some cases, -harder- than yard
trash in tier one.  Yes,the mobs don't hit as hard, but there are more of them,
lots of them casters, if you don't have good single pulling or CC you get
swarmed and dead in a hurry.  POD rats?  How hard can it be, its outdoors, if
everyone has SOW there's really no excuse for anyone dying at all, certainly not
anyone past the puller.  Pull spiders or mosquitoes and its a different story,
bugs over in the courtyard will do damage so quickly as to devour anyone this
low that gets aggro accidentally before they can think of running... but rats?
Flies?  Come now, if you can't handle that with 6 people in their low 50s you
might consider going back to Crushbone.
