By the way, my wood elves, if swimming on CR, do look virtually naked
from a certain camera angle. My problem with the new suits is that
judging by Conan the female dark elf, they're more clunky rather than
elegant, and that they're combined with extensive plastic surgery in
the upper chest region (They need the massive training bra rather than
bikini just to keep things in place!)
