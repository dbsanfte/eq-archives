Well, it wasn't an insult.  It was my assessment of that statement.
But ok...

Quote:  "we're talking what should be done game-mechanics wise"
This might be what <you> want to be talking about.  The other
contributors to this sub-thread are talking about the relationships
between certain classes.

Quote:  "IC view of those roles is irrelevant"
Everquest still calls itself an RPG, the designers still make
decisions based on the concept of "immersion".  Game-play, and
thus game-mechanics choices, in such an environment is rather
obviously affected by the IC view.  Your claim that the IC view
is irrelevant is so blatantly incorrect that it fully qualifies
for "stupid", "idiotic", "moronic", or any similar characterization.

Hmmm, upon further review, here's a more accurate assessment:
That <is> the stupidest statement I've ever seen you post.
