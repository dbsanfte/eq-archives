That's a good point. Hopefully they wrote the spell swapping code 
smartly enough so that it would not forget/rememorize the spell 
in slot X if said spell is already in place there.

We will probably need to be sure to place DA/DB in the same slot
in every spell bank, which most people would do anyway.
