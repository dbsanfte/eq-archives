You've discovered why yaks suck, congrats ;) Now that you are 40 its
time to think about buying 2 good weapons to replace them. They were
not horrible in the old game but now so many far better weapons are
around. If dual wielding as a warrior you want 2 pretty fast weapons
with as near a 2 ratio (or better ) as possible. For example a 20 spd
10 damage weapon is a 2 ratio. A yak is 24 spd 8 damage, thats a 3
ratio and rather horrible.

Your dex is plenty high for a warrior and in fact if you even added 20
or 30 points your yaks would not really be that much better. The
problem is you fell for the promise of yaks which is that the PROC
makes them worth it (since their ratio really sucks for what people
try to sell them for) Here is a bit of Procing advice:

Forget that the thing procs at all when buying it and place ZERO value
on the proc. Why? Because 9 times out of 10 its not going to proc.
Procing is only a nice bonus but not something to depend on for damage
output. 

Your stats don't really matter as long as your agil is 75 or over
(even 74 is a HUGE ac hit) and as a warrior you have as much sta as
possible. Always go for AC and HP first and everything else kinda
falls in place.
