Melee don't NEED KEI, do they?
If you can't learn even the basics of mana management, you shouldn't
play anything with mana. And note that many casters were notorious for
fast leveling and solo abilities long before most mana buffs existed.

Oh, I've tried it. My main druid quite often gets KEI or better in
groups or raids. One of my other druids was given tranquility at level
22. However, when the spells wear off, I don't scream and run to the
nexus for more: I just _alter my tactics_ and keep going, be it group
or solo.
If I can group in Plane of Valor, be the only healer, have no
enchanter buffs around and still have enough mana to nuke a bit in
addition to healing, I guess I must be doing something wrong since
something like that is clearly impossible in whatever version of EQ
you seem to be playing.
