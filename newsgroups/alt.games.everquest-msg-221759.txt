You missed your best shot at it last May when Stromm opened.  I had a
lot of fun playing there, until my Druid found he just couldn't keep
up with his guild anymore and they were pretty much the only folks
he had grouped with.  So I returned to Kaev, and they released LDoN
which resurrected the pickup group.  This is absolutely fantastic for
a non-raider/never-gonna-be-a-raider/don't-have-a-regular-group-
because-my-playtime-is-irregular casual player like me.
