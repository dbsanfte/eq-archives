Dear Dennis,

I'm very sorry to hear you're "Google Challenged".  Don't give
up hope.  With practice and determination, you too can learn to
use Google.  By practicing the valuable skill of reading, you
can also discover that some of your preconceived notions about
cats are incorrect.  Reading is a great learning tool.

But, since you ARE still currently "Google Challenged", I'll get
you started.  You'll be pleased to know that with a carefully
thought out query, I managed to get these all to appear on the
very first page of hits!

Have a nice day!  And, I'm sorry, domesticated (house) cats
aren't pack animals, as much as you might hope they are.
