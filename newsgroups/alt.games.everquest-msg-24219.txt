In 60, just as you leveling in all the other levels, fill up 5 blue makes up for
1 yellow. But at the end, even if have all the 5 yellows, you won't ding. If you
keep getting exp, you will see all your exp bar in 5 yellow. But if you stopped
getting exp, your exp bar will drop back into 4 yellow and 5 blue. When I first
found that, I thought it's a bug....you know, one minute ago you see your exp
bar all yellow (that's quite a sight =D)...and the next minute, it's 4 yellow
and 5 blue....but now I just get used to it.
