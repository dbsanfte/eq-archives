if most people think opening up old, locked zones is alright, it's
either because they think no one cares about that content (so who
cares if it's free now?) OR because they think it's too hard for
people to earn access properly

but you, you're still doing that content - you should be the one who's
upset

and you're not, so that's great



seems sony's done something right for once (though as others have
pointed out, it's too little too late for some people...)


people being happy about a move by sony = funny
