One thing that could be fun is to get the longest range
bow you can get your hands on, along with the longest range
arrows (your archery range is <bow range> + <arrow range> ).

I'll bet you can shoot arrows at the necro from a lot
farther away than the necro can reach you with spells.
Try some long-distance bow-kiting.  :-)

I don't know how much use necros get from buffs they can
cast on themselves, but one of my favorite "secret weapons"
during duels is the Golem Metal Wand, which is the common drop from
the Steel Golem in the bottom of the gator pits in Cazic-Thule.
It has five instant-cast charges of "Pillage Enchantment",
*each* of which can remove four buffs from your target.
Target your opponent and triple-click it the instant the
duel starts, and suddenly your opponent is *totally* buffless.
I shocked the hell out of a Shaman during a duel that way
once -- he had spent five full minutes buffing himself up
before the duel, including SoW and bear form, and *bam*, it
was all gone.  It's also useful for removing bad spells
from yourself, if you've had the foresight to leave "open"
buff slots at the top of your buffs for the bad buffs to
land in (otherwise you remove all your "good" buffs first,
which is a waste).

You can also buy <mumble> Pumice from potion vendors,
it's very handy for removing "evil buffs", which the
necro will be throwing at you often.

Forget AC -- you won't be meleeing if you snare/root
the pet properly.  Fill *all* equipment slots with
either MR/PR/DR gear, or +HP gear -- the more HP
you have, the longer you'll survive against the
nukes and DoTs which are the necro's primary weapons.

Snare him, Root him, and rush in to beat the snot out
of him, while trying to stay out of reach of the pet.

Buff yourself up, starting with a bunch of "junk" buffs
(i.e., any buff which will be useless for this fight, and/or
less useful than others), followed by all your "good" buffs.
Put the most critical ones at the top (e.g. SoW, etc.)
Then CLICK OFF the bottom four or so junk buffs.  This will
leave an open space for the necros DoTs to land.  This way,
when you use the Pumice or Golem Metal Wand to remove them
(the magic-based ones, anyway), those will be the first to
be stripped off (and not your good buffs).  With enough Pumice
you should be able to remove the magic-based attacks (including
the annoying Darkness spell) from you almost as soon as they
land (and with enough MR, they won't often land).

Make sure you have "See invisible" up as one of your own
buffs, lest the necro try to fade away and go med up
for a few minutes for a renewed attack.

Set up a "/target necroname" hotkey before the duel, so
you can quickly reacquire him as a target after you've
switched to the pet to reroot it.
