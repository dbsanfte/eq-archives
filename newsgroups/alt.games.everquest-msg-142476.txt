}Yep.  Cuz I don't believe mez works on kos mobs for quests.. im pretty sure
}about that.  Of course if he can name specific mobs I will go test them, and
}say if i were wrong

Mmm... I think there are quests that can theoretically be done at any 
faction level, but I haven't really tested it.  The ones I've come across 
were wimpy quests like the freeport notes to janam and rebby sort of 
thing... Very small faction hit, but sometimes the only way to repair a 
certain faction.  I'd have to go check my notes, which are 3K miles away, 
but I bet somewhere there's a quest it would work for. :)
