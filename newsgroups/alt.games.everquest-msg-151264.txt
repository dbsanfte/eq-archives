Ask him what the problem is.  If you can't come to an agreement then
petition.  You may think it does no good and for a single incident you may
be correct, but if the harrassment continues you need to start creating a
record.  If they get 5 petitions in a month they might even start keeping an
eye on him.  You never know.  But yes, they will never do *anything* based
just on your word.  They will need to see.  If he says anything damning then
/petition and /report.
