That must be Gunrich; he's a goblin but he won't KOS you.  He's
actually some sort of spy/traitor and I think he's on rogue faction;
he's part of a quest in Misty Thicket.  You're supposed to say to him
"Dark rivers flow east" and if you have good enough rogue faction,
he'll give you a case of Blackburrow stout to give to Rueppy Kutpurse
in the Fool's Gold Tavern in Rivervale for money and experience.  But
yeah, if you say anything about "Deeppockettsss" he'll attack you and
the guards will kill you if they catch you attacking him.

(note:  There's another named goblin named Mooto that wanders around
the various goblin camps; he is also KOS like the other goblins, he's
about level 11 and I think is a shaman.)
