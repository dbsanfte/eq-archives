So you believe that anyone (that uses Mana) showing up for a group should
have already got KEI and do you also believe that all Tanks should grab Aego
or HoV before looking for groups?
If you invited someone into your group and found they didn't have KEI would
you kick them out?
Or would you first make sure they had it first before letting them in?
This may not be what you are suggesting but by they way you argueing this is
how it comes across.

They haven't suddenly made the mobs tougher in Pick-up zones but the
equipment people have is far better than what was around when most of those
zones were first created, the job is easier already without KEI, it
shouldn't be a requirement or even considered.
