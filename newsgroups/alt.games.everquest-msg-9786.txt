OK, Did you try to adjust the settings up manually?
(Right-Click on the desktop->PROPERTIES->Settings)
When you install a new driver it may still hold the 16color 640
setting till you set it higher. Also click on the ADVANCED button, and
then the ADAPTER tab. You should see ATI Radeon as the loaded adapter.
If it says STANDARD VGA, then the new driver didn't load.

If it refuses to let you set it any higher, or the new drivers are not
properly installed. Try running the Setup.exe located in the following
directory: C:\ATI\support\WME_RADEON_4_13_7075.

I can't think of anything that I have missed. The steps I have given
you are the ones I used when I installed my Radeon a couple weeks
back. I built my own PC and it doesn't have built in video like a
Compaq. Maybe your compaq doesn't work with a Radeon card. Some older
PCs do not have compatible AGP slots for the newer video cards.

Good Luck!

PS. make sure that your monitor is plugged into the Radeon's video out
connector and not the one built into the Compaq.
