Oh, so you're talking about equipment.  There's a difference
between buying a 60 with all spells and all skills maxxed and
buying a 60 with that PLUS best-in-game equipment in all slots.
One "ruins" the game by putting in characters who don't have
anything to gain by playing;  the other doesn't.  All IMO, of
course.
