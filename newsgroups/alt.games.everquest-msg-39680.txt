But what the heck does he mean by "skilled" players? AFAIK all races/classes
run the same speed. Are they adding a run skill to the game? Does he mean
"SoWed" players?

If the horse doesn't run any faster than a normal character un-SoWed then
these will just be used for screen shots and weddings, especially if they are
expensive. If they run as fast as a SoWed player then they will be seen all
over the place.

What I am wondering is are you taller when you are on the horse?
If I am riding the horse across EC can I stop at an Inn and go inside
and buy/sell from a merchant. Do I get off the horse and back on again?
Or does the horse *poof* if I get off? Still lots of questions.
