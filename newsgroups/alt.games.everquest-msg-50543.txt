Well folks I have been dabbling with a Mage. Previous to this, I have always
played a melee class. Caster classes are like nite and day compared to the
melee classes. My main question is where are some good sites for the nuances
of the Mage class? Sure I know the sites for the technical aspects, but
playing a mage is really an art form. Up until this point, I have been
pretty lucky in that I can afford a death or 2, now its getting really hard
to recover from loss of XP. At this point, I can't afford to make any
mistakes any more.

Anyone know of any good sites for this type of info? Thanks in advance.
