In order...

Original everquest: Odus, Antonica and Faydwer. All the starting cities are
here except shar vahl (luclin) and cabilis (kunark).
Kunark: One big island. you can get to by boat from butcherblock and also
oasis of marr. Also POK portal (fironia vie) and Nexus portal (dreadlands)
is there. Iksar home city is in the middle of the island.
    Scenery is jungle/woods and some glacier.
Velious: Another big island. Mostly ice and snow. get to it by barge from
north ro, or theres a POK book and a nexus scion that take you to great
divide.
Luclin: Aliens and more aliens. This has the bazaar, and also the nexus.
Portals to various places operated by nexus scions. People use POK books
these days tho. POK books in shar vahl and nexus.
Planes of power. Plane fo knowledge is here. Rest of it is mainly raid
content, with a couple of zones good for xp (BOT and {POV). Those who are
flagged for it can xp in plane of earth. You need to be level 55 to get into
most of the lower tier zones here. Higher tier are 63+ or flag only.
Legacy of ykesha: This is the area throughthe boat in stonebrunt mountains.
Mainly seafaring type seting, fighting sailors etc etc. Theres a POK bok to
gulf of gunthak.
Lost dungeons of norrath: These are instanced dungeons where you take a
group through and collect so many items within a certain time, or kill so
many mobs in a certain time. You get "adventure points" for winning and can
buy nice nodrop items with them. LDON camps in butcher, east commons, north
ro and south ro. Also some in GOD zones but i dont know if they give
missions yet.
Gates of discord: This was very high level, but it was recently toned down
quite a bit. You still dont want to be here before level 50 tho, or 65 if
you go in deepish. Most of the deep zones for this are key only.

Some of these expansions are bundled together now, but im not sure on the
details of that.

Most important things are probably Plane of knowledge (POP expansion) and
bazaar (luclin expansion). Unless your playing a soloing character, you
probably want to start on stromm or morden rasp. The other servers tend to
be deserted in all the newbie areas. Everyone seems to be lvl 65 these days.
