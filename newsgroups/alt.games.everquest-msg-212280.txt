You have to visit Mauvin(sp?) in the basement to get flagged but you
don't need to do it until after you've completed a trial. Your chances
of completing even the easiest trial as a 54 druid unless you have a
group of 60+ well geared friends willing to let you tag along while they
do the actual work is slim to none unless they've downgraded the
difficulty considerably since I did them. When PoP came out, only L60's
geared very well for their level were making it through the trials,
which is why the trial is no longer a requirement for entering those
zones, and only required for further planar access beyond them.
