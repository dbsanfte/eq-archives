Those of you who are running ATI Radeon cards and were, like me, having 
trouble with the gamma setting being reduced dramatically when going from 
windowed mode to full screen, might want to download the latest drivers 
from ATI. I did and have not had to touch my gamma settings slider since. 
:)

There are a couple of strange bits of behavior I still notice though:

Human males look like they have something glowing in their right back pants 
pocket just below their waist.

In Maiden's Eye (haven't really noticed it elsewhere), when a mob's corpse 
disappears, it vanishes all together except for the mouth which follows 
about half a second behind.

Now I notice that sections of players' hair sometimes appear to be 
different colors. The bangs will be different from the rest of the hair, or 
in my case, my dark brown beard is a different shade of brown than my dark 
brown hair (yes, I tried to match them with no success).

Anyway, the gamma fix was great. The rest is really no big deal.
