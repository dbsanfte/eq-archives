Then Bush is a sad reflection of how far you've fallen.

Bush scored in the bottom fifth of the actual intelligence portion of
the military aptitude tests. Where he scored high on was the so-called
"leadership" portion.

And while experts have found that Bush is probably around average
intelligence, they also conclude he doesn't do much with what he has.
He appears closeminded, lacking in any real interests besides baseball
despite the financial means to do anything he wants, and so on.

Two thirds (probably more) of AQ's known members from the 9/11 period
have been killed or captured. That is where that statistic comes from
when Bush referenced it in the debates. They've gotten new ones since
then.

A *lot* of them, thanks to republican stupidity in Iraq.

If you think the US is actually winning the war on terror, then its
not hard to see why you are a Bush supporter. The US has never had
*less* support than it does right now.

Btw, read:

Long story short: Bush supporters are uninformed. You won the election
on the backs of the hick and fundamentalist vote. Don't think that
that changes reality.
