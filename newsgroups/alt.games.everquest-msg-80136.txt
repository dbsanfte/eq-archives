You can get non KOS faction with the Troopers by killing goblins, but
for the other Cabilis factions by turning in bone chips to a particular
Trooper at the city gates you can raise most if not all the other city
factions.  Can't recall, may be one more that isn't raised on this
quest, I haven't worked on it for some time.  I'm sure your favorite
spoiler site can fill in the details, but be prepared to collect a lot
of  bones.  With a religion I would imagine you are looking at 3-5k
bones??  Someone with a religion who has done this can give you more
detail, but I seem to recall someone saying recently they required
something like that as a dwarf with a religion.  As an agnostic I've
turned in over 1200 and am still glared at by the odd factioned Crusader
who patrols that gate so even for agnostics in Iksar illusion its a long
process.
