In article <3999r5F5uknopU1@individual.net>, Imperial.Palace@Rome.com 
says...

Even if you -can- sell items for real world cash, that isn't going to 
stop high level characters from handing over their 'junk' to their 
friends. Think about it... a +3 cloak that takes 20 hours to get, when 
you have a +5 cloak... you expect most people to -care- about its market 
value of $3.50?

Maybe you know people for whom 18c/h is a raise and who are looking at 
making a career at this, but for me, I'd as soon give it away as sell 
it. 

If I was looking to make money I'd turn EQ off, work for 15 minutes, and 
then play EQ for 19.75 hours and end up ahead.

Obviously there is a market for games in which you can buy and sell your 
'stuff'. Equally obviously there is a market for games in which you 
*cannot*.

Hopefully, eventually we'll each be able to play the kind of game we 
want. Ideally the ebayers should have a legitmate secure means to 
transact in their game and the anti-ebayer crowd should have a game 
that's not polluted with ebayers.
