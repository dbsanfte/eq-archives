(LORE - MAGIC)
Stats: AC: 12 - Wt: 1 - Slot: chest
Attributes: STR+4 INT+4 WIS+4 SV COLD+10
Comment: Found on an Herbalist in the Crystal Caverns.
Average Price: 1,700

Foreman's Skull Cap
Races: ALL - Classes: WAR CLR PAL RNG SHD MNK BRD ROG SHM (LORE - MAGIC)
Stats: AC: 8 - Wt: 2 - Slot: head
Attributes: STR+4 DEX+2 STA+2 SV COLD+10

This is found on name Orc Foreman in Crystal Caverns

Crystal Caverns orcs are easy for a group of you around early 30's. You can
get the robe for 1kpp or less and the Cap for 400pp. Thats 20ac and a lot of
stats for some easy kills that will net you very, very good exp. There is
also a bank in the zone you can use but you can't use merchants unless you
can Hide and Sneak
