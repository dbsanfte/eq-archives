/ramble on

Leaves are falling all around,
It's time I was on my way.
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged
For such a pleasant stay.


And now it's time for me to go,
The autumn moon lights my way.
But now I smell the rain,
And with it pain,
And it's headed my way.
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired,
But I know one thing I got to do,


Ramble on,
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song.
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl,
On my way,
Been this way ten years to the day,
Ramble on,
Find the queen of all my dreams.


Got no time for spreading roots,
The time has come to be gone.
And though our health we drank a thousand times,
It's time to Ramble on.


Ramble on,
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song.
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl,
On my way,
Been this way ten years to the day,
Ramble on,
Find the queen of all my dreams.


Mine's a tale that can't be told,
My freedom I hold dear;
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air,
T'was in the darkest depth of Mordor
I met a girl so fair,
But Gollum, the evil one crept up
And slipped away with her.
Her, her....yea.
Ain't nothing I can do, no.


Ramble on
