Aw, too easy.

Paladin/Wizard - paladin pulls, and maintains aggro while wizard blows it
up.  How better than a solo wizard?  Can fight in tight quarters where
kiting is a hassle or impossible; healing is available; less downtime
(wizard can medd while paladin is pulling, and after mob turns into a
runner).  Better than solo paladin - can take tougher mobs than the paladin
can solo, since the paladin's major lack (DPS) is neatly covered.

Rogue/Wizard - Wizard stuns, snares, and drops a nice taunty nuke, then runs
in slow circles while rogue backstabs.  Can you say aggro-kite?  This duo
can take on some pretty tough mobs; stuff the wizard can't solo due to too
many HP are cake, and healing should be almost never necessary since the mob
will be chasing an out-of-reach wizard.  Wiz may have to resnare, but that
just builds aggro.  I do a variation on this frequently in HoH, btw; I build
up aggro and have the Guardians chase me around, while my ranger friend
plinks or melees from behind.

Anyone else?
