I don't think it's a crappy item.  Most weight reduction bags (at least, the
ones that are reasonably easy to find and don't cost a fortune) seem to be
lore items.

Correct.  Here's a quick summary of how retail software works in the United
States.

    1. You basically rent shelf space from CompUSA and other such stores.
    That gets your product placed there.  If you want one of those end
    displays, you pay extra.  If you want your product to show up in the
    store's ads, you pay extra.

    2. If a customer buys the product, the store and distributor take their
    huge cuts, and months later, you get some money.

    3. If somone out-bribes you for your shelf space, the store sends your
    boxes back.

The mail order catalogs work similarly.  When you see a product with a full
page in the catalog, it's not because PCMall or PCWarehouse or whoever
decided they like the produce.  It is because the vendor coughed up a lot
more money than the people that get the 1/8th page entries.  The catalog
sales companies actually make something like 60-70% of their money from
selling space in the catalog.  The money from the customers for buying the
software is secondary.

The above is what I saw when the company I work for had retail products on
the shelves.  (Now we sell almost exclusively via the internet)  (I believe
Costco, however, works in a more sane fashion...actually buying the product
from the vendor, deciding how to display it, etc., which is why we do do
some selling there).

For another take on this, check here:

http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-352.html

and scroll down to "Distribution Myths and Lies", where the founder of
Bungie talks about all this.

Direct sales from Sony would be fine, too.  It's getting the distributors
and stores out of the loop that is the big deal.

The only reason I can think of for *encouraging* people to buy the retail
version is that they figure that they have to have a retail version for a
couple of reasons:

1. It looks good on the shelves.  When a newbie is looking for a game, and
sees SWG, Shadowbane, AO, AC2, DAoC, and EQ, they might be more likely to
pick EQ if they see a bunch of different expansions there.

2. There are people who would find downloading or ordering on-line
difficult.

and, since they have to put some boxes on the shelves, they would rather
have them all sell, than eventually get sent back, since they lose money on
boxes that come back.
