The Pantheon being the first guild in force to enter Sleeper's Tomb, and
having a
server-wide first (grats 3rd warder), would put them number one in sheer
power
on the Innoruuk server, with Legions of Darkness (just got Statue of Rallos
Zek,
grats to them), and Ashen Vendetta (cleared Veeshan's Peak first, killed
Zland,
ganged up with Panth to down Yelinak) close behind.

Comparing Methods of Madness to any of those three, or even The Defiant,
Neo Alliance, or AV/BH  is not a good idea. You got totally nailed on island
three of PoA, and have yet to down Venril Sathir or the Queen of Chardok...
