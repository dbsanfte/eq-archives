Summary at the end, I wrote a bit much...

Just thought this might clarify the role part of the post a bit.
Basically same info, just a different format, I just perfer it this way
=p. (This is the role in a group, not necessarily soloing, or
raiding.):

Bard: The bards purpose in a group is the assist others. in both DPS
(damage per second), mana/hp regenartion, running speed, tanking at low
levels, pulling, crowd control (unless there is an enchanter) and
anything else you can think of. One of the most unique classes, you'll
have to play one to really understand them =).

Beastlord: The Bastlords help in two big ways, DPS and buffing.
Beastlords get most shamans spells, although at later levels, and some
ones of their own. This can help the others in the group greatly. The
other part, DPS, is accomplished through their pet. The more things
beating on the mob the better (as long as the tank keeps the agro)
;-).

Cleric: Main healer, objective is to keep the tank alive. Also has some
buffs to help raise the tanks hp/ac. This is tied for the most
important class in a group, tied with the tank.

Druid: Druids can not only buff, but also heal in a group. Although not
as good as a cleric, they can still keep the tank alive in most
grouping situations. As far as buffs go, they have a couple HP/ac
buffs, along with DSs (When you take melee damage you return a certain
amount), and what have you.

Enchanter: Can we say, crowd control? Especially in high end, when the
puller messes up and pulls to many mobs, the enchanters will mezz all
but the one the tank is attacking. This will prevent it from attacking,
and just stand there staring. (Bards can also do this, however not
nearly as well). A few other roles are haste, to assist in DPS, and the
clarity line of spells, aka: Crack. The more mana regen, the less
downtime between fights, idealy none. 

Magician: The magicians specialty is summoning. This can vary from pets
(Great additions to DPS), to items used to regen mana (High end spell,
you can worry about that later). They can also nuke, root, the basics.

Monk: Monks are often the pullers in groups. This is because of their
special skill, fiegn death, which, if the pull goes bad, stops all mobs
from attacking them, and wander back to where they were pulled from.
They also assist in the groups DPS quite well. Can tank in low end
groups aswell.

Necromancer: As the other pet classes, Necro's get a pet skelly that
helps greatly with the groups DPS. They also have great DoTs (Damage of
time), which help kill the mob, along with some spells that tansfer hp
to mana, and mana from them to others.

Palidan: A cross of a warrior and a cleric. They can tank quite well,
even in high end, and can heal decently. They also get most cleric
buffs and some unique ones.

Ranger: Ah, another DPS class ;-). Rangers have a specialty in bows,
especially in high end, where they can deal great quantities of damage.
They also have much of the druid line of spells, along witha  few
unique ones. They can tank low, mid and sometimes even highend mobs.

Rogue: DPS, DPS, DPS. Rogues get a skill called backstab, which deals
great damage to the mob, along good normal melee damage. They also are
useful pullers, with special stealth abilities to keep away extra mobs
on pulls, or just while traveling.

Shadow knight: Shadow knights are a kind of mix between necros and
warriors. They get pets, although weaker then necro pets, and some of
the necro line of spells, while still maintaining good tanking
abilities. Shadow knights can often tank highend mobs.

Shamans: Shamans can not only buff, but heal quite well too. If no
clerics are avaliable, groups usually look for a shaman to heal. They
also have many, many buffs to help with players stats. They also get a
pet, although it's considerably weaker then other pet classes pets.

Warrior: They are almost always they are the tank/meatshield in the
group. The warriors job is to make the enimie hate him so much that he
is the only person to ever be attacked. Warriors have some abilities to
help them do this (taunt), and high hp so they don't die. Often pull
for the group, for ease of the group, that way they don't have to steal
agro before the puller dies.


Alright, here's the bare bones:
Bard: DPS/songs
Beastlord: DPS/buffs
Cleric: Healing+/buffs+
Druid: Healing/buffs
Enchanter: Crack/Crowd Control
Magician: DPS/summons
Monk: DPS/pulling
Necromancer: DPS/buffs
Palidan: Tank/heals
Ranger: DPS/buffs
Rogue: DPS/pulling
Shadow Knight: Tank/DPS
Shaman: Healing/buffs+
Warrior: Tank+/pulling

Basic group set up:

Slot 1) Tank: Warrior+/Palidan/Shadow Knight
Slot 2) Healer: Cleric+/Druid/Shaman
Slot 3) Crowd Control: Enchanter+/Bard
Slot 4) DPS: Pretty much any not already there.
Slot 5) DPS: ^
Slot 6) DPS: ^

Some cases require different setups, but that's a basic one.

Enough of my rambling.
