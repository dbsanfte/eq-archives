Only advice I would have is that perhaps if this is your first character you
might want to try something other than the wizard which can be extremely
painful to level.  I've played most classes to at least 20 and have found the
wizard to by far be the most difficult.  Unless you have some friends to play
with already, it can be hard to find a group and very hard and slow to solo.
