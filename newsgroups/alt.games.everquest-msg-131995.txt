Hmmm EQ PnP RPG. I heard of this, anyone playing it? I'd be interested to
know how character Generation works?
Like, do you get a certain number of points to spend on PC spec and Internet
Connection? A critical failure causes LD and you can no longer react for
30rnds and the GM gets to run your character off to some obscure location
while this happens :ï¿½)
