I actually created a hotky that says:  /r In group and twisting, will get
back to you when I can.

When I see a tell flash by I can easy tap it (on my second bay with other
abilities like hide and sneak, and pick lock).  Seems to help curb
misunderstandings of why I don't respond right away.  People who don't play
bards can't even begin to understand that even typing "/r Hi" is near
impossible.
