Hehe, nothing wrong with playing safe, the first thing i did when 
installing SneakyAmp was to do some testing to see if it in any way 
tried to communicate or send data out.

But the program been out for a LONG time now, impressive that people can 
do claims like that about it. Especially like that they claim its a 
program and alter Exe files. They cant even have installed it if they 
thing that.
