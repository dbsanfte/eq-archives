I'm still wearing Imbued Northman armor in a couple spots, been very slowly
upgrading it as I can.  At 53, even with 150 wisdom, you should be able to
take on the Sun Revenants, maybe not Reavers, and the Wyverns, probably most
of the others as well.  You would probably be better off just using Plague,
which is slow, but gives you a lot more med time.  I found, that I can take
down a Revenant or a Reaver starting with only 2 bubbles of mana by no
EBolting them.  It's slower, but it does work.
