Further, every LDoN group I've been in has spent the remaining 30
minutes running around killing for exp and loot, looking for mini
bosses and so forth; you've already got a group together, and
there's few zones better exp than an LDoN dungeon, its having to
get a new group together and move to the next dungeon that eats
into exp per hour, so by staying and clearing you up your exp per
hour average.

Point being, if you don't leave till the dungeon closes, then
there's only a couple minutes wait for your bodies to show up for
rezzing.
