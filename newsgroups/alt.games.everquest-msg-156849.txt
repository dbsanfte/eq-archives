What's wrong with having person X aggro the camp, and then run within
casting range of person Y, who casts on the one that is supposed to be
pulled?  Y then brings that one to the raid, and X runs the others away to
Rivervale or Highpass, or dies and gets resed?

Kith is an outdoor zone without many high level mobs.  A raid force should
be able to deal with lack of Harmony.  It is XP groups that are screwed by
this.
