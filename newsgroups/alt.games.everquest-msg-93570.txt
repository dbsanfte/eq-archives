From a recent post in the Developer's forum:

   19) Now that pets are capable of zoning with their masters 
   why donï¿½t they? - Fadzen Silverthorn

   A) Some do, some don't. The familiar is, essentially, 
   a buff with a visual representation. The warder zones, 
   but it loses its buffs when it does so. In reality 
   all pets need to be 'recast' when the owner zones. 
   The warder gets all tiny when he zones and the buffs 
   needed to bring him back to speed are very much in 
   line with a Mage recasting his pet. Basically, we 
   decided not to dramatically change that part of gameplay.
