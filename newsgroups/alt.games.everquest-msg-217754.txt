Actually, the effect currently listed is adding to your mana pool

4:  Increase Mana Pool by 20 (duration: unlimited?)

contrast to effects that add to your current mana like Covetous Subversion

2:  Increase Mana by 100 (duration: instant)

Also of note is that Lucy has the 32 bard mana song as an instantaneous
mana burst just like twitch. 

2:  Increase Mana by 5 (L32) to 7 (L48) (duration: instant)

Finally putting paid to some people's speculation that it isn't a
burst of mana on the pulse.
