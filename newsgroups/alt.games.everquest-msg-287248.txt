Played on a rl friends account,after my experiences with EQ1(which
I left mostly cause they lie and hold out their *paying* customers (
AB instance server hardware not sufficient for the playerbase for
a year) SOE wont see a nickel from me ever again).
That's the weird thing,found a wonderful small guild which was 
(and still is) growing rapidly.
Seems to be much easier to make or find a group as in EQ1 even
at  low levels.
My playtime was all in all half solo/half grouped where I didnt make
much xp grouped,was with guild making mostly grey heritage quests
for status and guild xp.

Cant follow you with "not eq-lite" and "eq-not-tedious".
I already covered the "lite" aspect with the sheer unbeleivable speed
of leveling,also the non existant death penalty would fit well in this
category.(I already thought the corpse summoner in EQ1 was game
breaking,but in EQ2 death has become a means of transportation). 
All the quests are tedious,it feels like an endless LDoN to me with
very little variation,90% is "kill x mobs" and "collect 15 of these".
