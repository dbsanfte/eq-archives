First off no I'm not scamning here just wanna know if anyone else had/has
this problem.

I use to have an account over a year ago.  I own both the original and
Kunark.  I've obviously used the numbers on the CD's. I moved and have a new
computer & don't have anything on the old account.  I decided to play again
and tried to open a new account & it won't accept my Account Keys!  I've
sent a letter to Vernant but wondering if anyone had this problem & what
they had to do to resovle it.  Will I need to go and buy the game all over
again?
