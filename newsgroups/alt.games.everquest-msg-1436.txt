Ouch, sorry to hear it.  Well, now you know to only put stuff you don't mind
losing into it.

Another tip, always have the no-rent bag(s) in the lower right hand corner
of your inventory.  That way they're last to be used automatically when
looting.  There's a lot less heartache involved when you have to manually
move that rusty longsword (about 2g?) from a real bag to the no-rent one.
