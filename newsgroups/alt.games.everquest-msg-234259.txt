I've been playing since November of 1999 and I still haven't leveled a
character past 58. "The grass is always greener on the other side" is pretty
much how to describe my EQ career. I would always create a new character
after getting substantially far on my current one, thinking that I would
enjoy the other character much more; I wish I wasn't such an idiot and spent
the time on one single character. I've resubscried and have been doing that
on the Stromm server. So far, it has been some of the most fun that I've had
playing this game.
