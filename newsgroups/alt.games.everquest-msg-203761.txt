Go to POK
/oo lvl 12 druid lost his corpse in inoothule, anyone able to help me
please?

Dont send tells to bards/necros/SK asking for help. Other classes can help
if they have a necrotic device, so ooc is the best way.

You can also buy a chipped bone rod with 3 charges of locate corpse. They
are sold next to the kelethin bank (and other places) for a few pp.
