Yes I'm aware of that, in fact many times I've atoned mobs to save chanters the
mana and slot for their mem blur during normal combats.

They weren't waiting for mez to wear off, they were making mez were off when
they wanted it to by hitting the mob.  I had no control over their actions, as
my korean is limited to the names of some Tung Su Do katas.

From talking to someone else, I understand that if you keep the mob mezed too
long, you get repops and are forced to do parts of the quest over.  Whether they
were aware of this or not is anyone's guess.
