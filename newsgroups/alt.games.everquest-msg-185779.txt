Went to a high school where 75% of the students were black. If you
weren't one of the "gangsta wannabe" white kids and used the word
"nigger" in any way, you were putting your own neck on the line. I
know this for a fact, having seen the results with my own eyes. Don't
tell me I don't fucking know what I'm talking about.
