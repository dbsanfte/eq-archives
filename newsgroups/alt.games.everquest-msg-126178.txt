When you refer to "tutorial" do you mean the Prelude level?

You gain your first three levels running the prelude, and that should
be enough to continue on in the game. (The next stage should take you
to the Peninsula District with a prison riot)

What class are you playing? The spell selection and effects are very
nice. If you are playing a Gnome Sorcerer be sure to summon an animal
companion. The Dire Badger at level 1 is hilarious.

Also look into multi-classing. It is something that you CANNOT do in
EQ, and really makes the game shine on its own. I am running a
Monk/Sorcerer and a Barbarian/*Rogue and it is a lot of fun.

The story is what has me hooked. It's not Shakespear, but it is
entertaining and gives you a sense of purpose. There are tons of side
quests, and the animations, environments, and NPC interaction is
extremely immersive.

*Rogues are fully implemented in NWN....Pick Locks (doors, chests,
etc), Detect Traps, Disable Traps, Set Traps, Sneak Attacks
(Backstab), Stealth Mode (Hide/Sneak)

NWN won't replace EQ for me, but it is a wonderful game overall.
