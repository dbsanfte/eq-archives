Aye, except for casting Tash on boss raid targets, I use spell gems 99.9% 
of the time.  Even worse, from some people's point of view, 95% of my UI 
is the default, exception being that I added percentages to the mana/hp 
and exp/AAexp bars in the player window.  And moved the Enter/Leave Trader 
Mode buttons to not be on top of each other.

The Way I've Always Done It is not a force to be trifled with. :)

The thing is, you're not -always- going to be asking the 'do I have enough 
mana?' question.  Probably only 3% of the time I'm trying to cast a spell 
is it an issue.  I think, for that 3% of the time, I could mouse over to 
the spell gem, wait for it to change to the right color, and then hit the 
hotkey or however you normally cast.  What did you have in mind?  Have the 
hotkey change color?  What about hotkeys that cast more than one spell?

I could see a feature like, hold down alt and all the spell gems change 
color to indicate 'enough mana or not'.  Or even have the spells just 
by default, without hitting anything, be redder-bordered if you lack the 
mana, the same as they're dimmer if you haven't passed the recast time 
yet.

The main reason it won't work, I suspect, is that sometimes, if you lack 
the mana, it lets you try to cast anyway, and then steals some mana when 
the cast fails due to lack of mana.  Man, do I hate that.  I suspect it 
has to do with mana preservation items and AA, and specialization, and 
whether it thinks it fired or not.
