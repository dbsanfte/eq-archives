Jumping on as I have lost the orriginal msg.

I would make tradeskills viable as a way of making useable equipment.
This would mean lowering the cost of the components and the resale value
of the finished items.

Lets say that it costs 1kpp to get to make plate at the moment.
Reduce this cost down to about 200pp and 10th level chars could use this
as a way of making armour for themselves.
Don't make it profit making and if anything increase the amount of time
taken to skill up. Just make it afordable for new players to learn.

Jim
