Actually, I was thinking that Necro's should get Ressurection spells for
player corpses...

but that they should be able (or required) to cast their pet spells on MOB
corpses to get their pets.

The pet wouldn't neccessarily be any stronger than the pets they get now...

Or maybe they should be... much like Enchanter etc. charms.  If the corpse
is of too powerful a mob, it resists.  Then, instead of turning and
attacking its former master, it just poofs... with whatever loot was on it.
