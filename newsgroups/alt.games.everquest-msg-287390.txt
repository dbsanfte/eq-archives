Cant follow you with the 70 Beastlord,they get slow AND snare(as a
proc from pet),to my knowledge the only class with this combination
of abilities,in fact seeing Bsts totally overpwoered was one of the
(very minor) reasons I quit.

And who has ever heard of a Druid not being able to solo,not to speak
of one with "several thousnad AA points" ?

I agree,finding pick up groups in EQ1 has become harder and harder,
with DoN it even became worse,players only wanted to do the instance
they need for progression,quite dumb if you ask me,lfg for hours
for a special zone instead of being a little flexible and get at least
some xp and who knows a somewhat valuable drop.

>After that, ANYTHING seems easier.

and less rewarding in the long run.
Playing EQ2 on a rl friends account I had several burn out phases
already in the  5 months since I started it because the "difficulty "
level is simply much too low,and xping just a joke,one can solo
easily from 1 to 80 with a *Cleric* class.
Its the other extreme compared to EQ1,but I defintly would prefere
EQ1 cause its much more rewarding in the long run.
Sadly I am so p...ed about all those lieing and holding players on
by SOE I will never again pay for a SOE game.
