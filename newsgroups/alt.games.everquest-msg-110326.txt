Yep, and I rather like the idea.  How many people do you
know who have gotten their character up to the mid levels
and discovered that early choices have gimped them.  That's
because we made choices on stat allocation, and what skills
we used, prior to having any knowledge of what was going
on.  If you postpone the choices, and let people make contacts
and ask questions first - they are far less likely to make
decisions they are unhappy with later.
