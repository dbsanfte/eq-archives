Honestly, it really just went downhill from here. I'm sure you're 
extremely knowledgeable about the various classes and their individual 
abilities, but your assertions that your way is the only way to go are 
just plain lacking in the qualities of a person I might respect as a 
player. I honestly can't imagine the mentality that if you don't have a 
certain group makeup then you're doing it all wrong or suffering to some 
great extent from it. I think the problem in the scenario you mentioned 
lies with you, not them.

That's just not the way it's meant to be, bud. /shrug
