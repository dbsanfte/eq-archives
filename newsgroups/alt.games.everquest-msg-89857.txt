Here's the responce from SOE

Hello,

Unfortunately, EverQuest was designed to run with a desktop computer. We
do not support running the game with a laptop because the hardware
compatibility problem with these systems. Due the lack of driver support
by the chipset manufactures, we are not able to add support for most
laptop video and sound cards to EverQuest. Because of this we are unable
to provide you with technical support for your laptop. You can check our
website for a complete list of compatible video cards and sound cards
that we support at:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/audio_video/index.jsp

We can offer you some general troubleshooting tips, however beyond these
suggestions we are not able to provide you with any more support.

1: If you have not already done so, you will want to make sure you have
the latest drivers for your video and sound card along with the version
of DirectX supported by your hardware.

 2: If you are using an AGP based video card, try lowering the
multiplier from "x4" or "x2", down to "x1". You may want to check the
AGP Aperture size. To do this you'll need to enter your system BIOS.
When you restart your computer you should see a message like "To enter
setup press DEL (or F2, etc)".  Do that and go to the Chipset Features
entry (it may be listed as Advanced or Display on some motherboards) and
look for AGP/Graphics Aperture size. Change it to 256 Megs. This number
is not a reflection of your physical memory, but rather a maximum usable
size.

3: Another test is to temporarily disable your sound in EverQuest. In
order to do this, create a new, blank text file and name it
"NOSOUND.TXT". Drop this file into our EverQuest directory (the default
location is "C:\Program Files\EverQuest\"). You will not have sound in
the game while this file exists, but it can help us narrow down the
problem.

4: Make sure there are no tasks running in the background while EQ is
running. After a fresh reboot, hit Ctrl-Alt-Del to bring up a list of
running tasks. "End Task" on everything except Explorer, Systray, and
RNAApp (if listed), then connect to the Internet and start the game.

5: Make sure that you have at least 500 Megs of free hard-drive space
and that Windows is managing your virtual memory (if you haven't
manually changed this option then windows is managing your virtual
memory and you'll just want to make sure you have that much free space).

6: Finally, try playing on the Test Server. The Test Server is where new
program code is tested, before it is used on the regular playing
servers. In order to play on the Test Server, you need to run the
"testeverquest.exe" application in your EverQuest directory. The patch
process will download some files, and then you will be able to log on
using your established Station Name and Password. If the problem does
not occur while on the test server, then the problem may be a known
issue that has been worked on, and the new code will eventually migrate
to the other servers in a future patch.

I am sorry for the inconvenience that this has caused you and I hope
that you are able to resolve the problems that you are having with your
laptop and EverQuest.

If this does not solve your issue, please email me back or contact our
phone support Mon.-Fri, 8:30 A.M.-5:30 P.M. PST, at (858)537-0898.
Please be sure to include your original message with all future
correspondence regarding this matter.

Regards,

Anthony Worthy
Sony Online Entertainment CSR
