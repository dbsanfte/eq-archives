There is an EQ paladin discussion board at:

http://p202.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath

That board has discussions on various topics related to playing a
paladin in EQ; one of the topics (link towards bottom of the page) is
"Equipment Discussion and Advice".  

Hopefully that web page will be helpful to you.
