Or even that a guy playing a female character would pull it off so
successfully.

Iï¿½ve been known to give in to a beggar, in Oggok... Big ugly brute,
perfect roleplayer too. I twinked him silly. We need fewer beggars, but
we need more roleplayers, so I guess one thing compensates for the
other. Besides, Oggok is my adoptive city, and I have a fondness for the
big lugs. :)
