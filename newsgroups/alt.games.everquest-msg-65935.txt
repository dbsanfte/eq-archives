Assuming they haven't changed this command for SoL, the command you are 
looking for is

/wincolor <windowname> <R> <G> <B> <Transparency>

Windownames are CHAT, SPELL, PLAYER, PARTY, TARGET, BUFF, DATA, MAIN, INV, 
TRACK, or HOTBOX

One of those is probably the popup item window - Data, maybe?

R, G, and B are RGB values (no!) from 0 to 255
Transparency is 0 (off, i.e. completely see-through), 1 (25%), 2 (50%), 3 
(75%), 4 (100%, i.e. completely opaque)

So to make your data window solid black in fullscreen mode you would 
type:

/wincolor DATA 0 0 0 4

Then the background won't show through it.

If I've got the wrong window name, try experimenting.
