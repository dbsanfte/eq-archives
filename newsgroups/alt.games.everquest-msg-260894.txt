Would have been nicer if they had mentioned it.  They said that if you 
preorder you will get a little bit at a time, but did not say you need to go 
into advanced download to enable it.  A little *communication* would have 
saved many customers problems, and would have reduced the opening day stress 
on their download server.  Even better would have been to have an "enable 
daily download" permission button come up in the login process once oow was 
purchased.  They seemed to be well able to program that far when it came to 
asking us if we wanted to order.
