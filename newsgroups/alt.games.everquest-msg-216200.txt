Oh my mistake, I thought you meant "as a paladin"; so many of us have alts that
the "overlord" thing in your sig wasn't convincing.  No, a proc stun, or a stun
cast willy nilly instead of either chained or in direct response to casting
messages isn't all that likely to interrupt jack.  Even an Air pet wielding twin
Gnoll hide lariats (3 different stun proc chances) tends to let quite a few
spells  thru.
