What kind of dumbass argument is this?  Are you suggesting that whether or
not I'd be upset if someone scammed me in EQ has any bearing, *indeed is the
determining factor*, in whether a real life crime has occurred?

Hey, does the inverse apply?  If I go down to the police station and report
that my car has been taken from a parking lot without my permission, can the
policeman on duty say to me "Well, Mr. Whitney, you don't seem to be too
distressed about someone taking your car, so I must conclude that no theft
actually occurred."?
