I wasn't 100% sure about the penalty for ducking, and always thought
it was 0% but I may have misses a very small penalty in the thick of
action. I'd never really consciously looked at it for many a long
moon, so I tried an experiment out of pure curiosity.

I've just this minute done a check using my beastlord.  I memmed my 9
biggest buffs, went down the spellbar casting each in turn, waiting a
second until the spell was well into it's casting time, then ducked,
to interrupt it.  After doing this twice, I lost no mana *whatsoever*
after interrupting 18 times.  I suspected I'd lose a *little* bit of
mana, at least, over that many consecutive casts/ducks, but nope, mana
stayed at 100%.  

I also tried moving to stop the spell, and, at least on MY attempts,
it DID save the mana, although running about to stop a spell casting
just isn't as practical as merely ducking. two taps on the D key, and
no more spell, as I learnt years ago  :)  Chorkie would be better off
just using the tried and tested "duck" method, same as everyone else
does.
