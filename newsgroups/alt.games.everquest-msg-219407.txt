	By the Velious era, most Ranger issues were settled.  The 40% experience
penalty was gone, we had new spells including agro management, we got a
Defense upgrade, an ATK bonus, double damage for Archery against engaged
targets and Trueshot for raid targets.  Velious was when it became possible
for Rangers to fearkite to 60, because that's when we got Panic Animal and
there were animals in Velious that could take you that far.

	The Dark Ages for us were the Kunark years, when someone at Verant
(probably McQuaid) was hell-bent on proving that Rangers could survive as a
melee class with the Defense and hit points of WIS casters.
