Only thing I've had that was close to this was along this line.  I was main
tank in a LDON was first feared running me into another room picking up
mobs, however while still feared I ran back into the room with my group.  We
now had 3-4 adds plus original pull.  At this point mob who originally
feared me now charmed me and I went to work beating the crap out of the
groups cleric.  Luckily cleric didn't die and other members where able to
handle adds..
