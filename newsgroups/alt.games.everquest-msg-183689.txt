Lizards are bought at the lighthouse in Gunthak, theres a kennel out 
back so you can see which one you like the most. Cost 4994pp for the 
cheapest one (same price as white/black horse). Come in 4 speeds like 
horses, but only price for each speed class, no difference in price 
depending on colors like the horses.
Basically theyre identical to the horses, but with 2 MAJOR improvements. 
NO stupid horse head taking up 50% of the screen. But they bump when you 
ride them (youll know what i mean when you see one riding one), but 
anyone who played a 3D shooter should be used to that. They also turn 
faster than the horses, but still not as fast as without any mounts.

Basically the ability to actually SEE what youre riding into is a big 
improvement, and imo worth the few K it cost to upgrade (sell horse, buy 
lizard), and the turn thingy is just a bonus.
Besides theyre SO cute (took me 40 min to select which one i wanted), 
and look a lot cooler that a stupid horse.

And if you wanna see how they look, i just posted a pic of me and my 
lizard, just look at http://janus_n.homepage.dk/Lizard.jpg
