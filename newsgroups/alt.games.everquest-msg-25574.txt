Almost true. JBoots cast a SoW that is the same as a shaman/druid of the
same level as the wearer using them. TBoots cast a SoW that is the same as a
level 9 shaman casting it. They're slower. 10 shot SoW potions on the other
hand are dependant on the level of the drinker. Anyone want to buy some
potions off me? :)
