I've read so much bad stuff about Verant treating their customers like 
dirt. I'll admit that Everquest has great graphics.. That's about it 
though.

Today I was reading an article about how a guy got his account hacked and
when he pentioned for help, he was basically told that if he wanted to 
launch an investigation into the hacking, he'd get banned.. Banned because
you are responsable for your account security..

Does this make sense to anyone else..? Certainly you should try to have a 
hard to guess password, but this type of thing happens all the time on the
Internet. Banning a user because some jerk got into his account is 
absolutely insane.

I was really excited to buy Star Wars Online when it came out, but I've
decided there is no way I'll play a game Verant runs.. At Verant it seems
to me that their customers are just a $ sign, and they have so many they 
can afford to treat them like garbage.

I play Asheron's Call, while the game certainly suffers from it's own 
problems like Everquest, I'm much more comfortable knowing that it has
a team of people who look out for their customers and actually care.
(Care as much as a company can atleast)
