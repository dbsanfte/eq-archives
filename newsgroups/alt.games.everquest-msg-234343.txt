My Voodoo 5 in the old box runs 'requires DX 9' games fine, as long as they
don't require Hardware T&L, but I've got some drivers that were cranky to
get installed. Not for the faint of heart.

The people that are going to get hit are the ones with old Intel, Voodoo etc
cards. Even though it's not a 'DX 9' part, older Radeons, Geforces,
Matroxes, etc should work fine.

Anyone looking for a cheap fully dx9 card I would recommend the Radeon 9200
(I think that was fully dx9), or Whatever the low end Geforce FX is. As far
as rewriting, overhauling the graphics engine is a good thing. SWG runs
faster and looks better on my machine than EQ. EQ's engine has been patched
so much  it really needed a major spring cleaning at least.

And they have done a good job of keeping oldsters going. Got a friend plays
DAoC. He's had to upgrade his video card twice. Each time an expansion came
out, it simply would not work with his existing card. Twice.
