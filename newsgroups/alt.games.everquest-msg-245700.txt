In general, I expect you're right that tribute isn't worth it at low
levels.  At high levels it looks like it's mostly a way to "fill in the
gaps" in your gear, e.g. some extra regen or flowing thought or focus
effects or whatever your gear isn't giving you.

But even at low levels, e.g. around 20+, there are a few tribute buffs
that I'm finding are worth paying for.  For 30 tribute/hour I can get
an extra 2 regen on my monk, which ain't bad.  (And I'll think about
coughing up 42/hour more for the next +2 regen, too.)  When my druid
hits 20 I'll think about Flowing Thought, too.

As long as you resist the temptation to buy lots of buffs, you can
probably afford these small payouts.  Either find the occasional item
in the bazaar that sells for 100-300 and is worth 1000-2000 tribute,
or spend an hour fishing off the boat in Abysmal Sea and turn in the
crabs/tuna for tribute.  (SOE nerfed the payoff from selling those to
NPCs, but the tribute values are still good.  I suspect this may even
have been deliberate on their part.)  They pay 1 tribute per 2 pounds,
rounded up.  So if you train up your baking skill so you can reliably
break down the crab/tuna to stacks of 1-pound items, you can get
1 tribute per pound.

Yeah, it takes some time, but at level 20 you can easily make 1000
plat worth of tribute in an hour, and that covers you for 30+ hours of
a regen or flowing thought buff.
