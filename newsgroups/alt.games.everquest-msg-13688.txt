>I'd say it's pretty <strong> speculation... 

	Nor would I disagree.

	But, you see, the thing about the phrase "<strong> speculation" is
that it contains the word "speculation."  The addition of the word
"<strong>" does not alter this inalterable fact.

	"Strong speculation" is still speculation.  And if it's
"speculation," then it's not "fact."  And if it's not "fact," then you
can't claim it as such.

	Well, you can, obviously.  I would imagine that nary a minute goes
by without someone, somewhere on Usenet claiming as "fact" something which
is really "opinion" or "speculation."  

	So, clearly, you *can* claim something as "fact" when it's not
really a "fact."  But, in my *opinion*, people who do this and subsequently
refuse to admit their error are morons.

	In any case, I was not saying that Lokari was wrong.  (Nor was I
saying that Lokari was right.)  I was simply saying that Lokari was stating
something as fact when he/she doesn't know it's fact and cannot prove that
it's fact.

	And that's all.

	AB
