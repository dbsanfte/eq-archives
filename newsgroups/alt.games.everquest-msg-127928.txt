The Maiden's Voyage is bugged.  I've had chars land in the water and dropped
on islands.  You can petition for a port, but it's quicker to head SW to the
firepot room.  Swim to the sunken spires, then swim to the hole in the
bottom of the ocean.  You'll drop into a room with 12 firepots (take about
100hp damage).  Walk up to one and click on it, you will be transported to
one of 12 Old World cities (depending on the pot).

Here's a link to the information...
