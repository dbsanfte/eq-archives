The author fails to realize that the audience for computer RPGs looks
for different things than the audience for pen and paper RPGs...even
though those audiences can be made up of the same people. People
accept and have no problems with the risk of perma-death in D&D, but
loathe the very mention of the idea in a computer RPG. I believe the
primary reason for this is the fact that pen and paper RPGs aren't
subject to crashes, software bugs that cause unavoidable deaths, and
so forth. There's a living person running each and every encounter and
this means there is a mind behind it that is capable of creative
reasoning and adapting to specifics of the situation rather than just
running through a pre-determined routine.
