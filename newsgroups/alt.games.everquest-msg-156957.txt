Funny how there seem to be lots of druids/wizzies porting on my server
still.

Clarity is not the only fruit. Most dungeons, and I gather most raids, cant
really be checked out without a chanter's crowd control. They have a line of
haste spells too I think. :P

/boohoo
Harmony doesnt work *all* the time anymore. Waaaah waaaahh.

> Wizards lost manaburn.

They lost the ability for 6 of them to manaburn an uber-mob to death, yes,
they can still manaburn as part of a raid or group.

Clerics IMHO, have been taking up up the wazoo for quite a while recently,
increased Paladin rezzes, near-CH druids and shammys.

And KEI vending machines, and gingerbread houses.
