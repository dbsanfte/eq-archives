Yeah - it's quite easy.  Just open the executable file (eqgame.exe or
everquest.exe (can't remember which - I'm at work right now!)) in Word
or your favourite hex / text editor.  Search for a phrase you know to
be in it ("Wood Elves", "Attaching beards to Dwarves" etc and you
should find all the phrases.

I did this about 6 patches ago, and they were there in plain text. 
Verant could have gotten a bit more sohisticated and
encoded/compressed the strings so they don't show up in plain text.  I
haven't checked it recently.

OT - I went on a Naggy raid last night.  First time I had decent
resist gear and buffs (over 100 MR and FR).  I made it to the end in
one piece!  And I won a polished mithril torque (AC7 WIS 13 INT 13). 
Should make skill ups a bit more often now!
