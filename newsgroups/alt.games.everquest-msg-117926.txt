You dont have to sit down for sit down hp regen

As a necromancer at level 12 its awesome. With death pact
I get more mana than I otherwise would and less hp loss, AND
I get all this while running around looking for more things
to eat (hp low. Must eat beetles. Mwahahahhahahaaa!)

Uhm. anyway. Horsey = Good ;)

I only bought the 8500pp one and actually its very slow, its
marginally faster than normal run, but it has a 2 or 3
second "getting up to gallop" canter, which means for a lil
while you're actually slower than you otherwise would be.

Useless for running away, but pretty, looks cool, and free
mana/hp regen thats significant, at least at lower levels,
and especially if you're a "solo" class thats going to spend
time looking for spawns rather than sitting in a camp on
your bootie medding ;)

(I acutally "solo" with a wizard, enchanter and rogue but hey... ;) )
