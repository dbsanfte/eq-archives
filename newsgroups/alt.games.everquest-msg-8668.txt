I love trying to convince spouses that it's not a waste of time.

Player says "But they need me to help them get this cool kill and I'm so
close to leveling"
nonPlayingParter says "Dinner is ready, I'm going to eat without you"
Player says "I'll be down after next pull"
nonPlayingParter */pause 60000000*
nonPlayingParter scowls at you -- where would you like to sleep tonight

Went camping in NJ this weekend in bear country. Actually saw a couple of
bears at another campsite.  Kept a look out near ours and kept thinking, if
I see one I need to say "Hail a black bear" to let group know it's there.
Also kept my hatchet close by in case I needed to melee.  Needless to say my
1HS is pathetic I'm sure, but I could dual wield with my knife I think.
