That not a fair analogy, actually. 1) The people doing the "screaming" 
were there first and had long since established legitimate protocol 
regarding the issue being contested. 2) The beer you drink hardly has any 
effect on anyone else at all. The way you post does. 3) Whereas you might 
have been addressed a little more diplomatically, it was certainly 
neither any manner of jumping up and down and screaming nor anyone 
holding their breath until they turned blue.

Just understand that you're no better for bucking the system just to 
bother people (you said it yourself, you would have gladly changed the 
way you post, but now you won't) than those who might have handled it a 
bit more tactfully in your mind, all exaggerations aside.
