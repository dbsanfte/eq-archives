I probably average a lock-up every 2 hours of play.  This problem will,
of course, make it impossible for me to play the "high levels", where the
XP loss is much more painful.  (My highest level is only a 17th level
druid.)

Since I solo a lot, that probably explains why I die a lot, when my
computer does lock up.  No group to protect me.

I'm sure I have some weird driver problem.  But I've tried so many
combinations...I'm just exhausted from trying.  I play many other
games (Diablo II, Baldur's Gate II, Deus Ex, others...) without any
kind of stability problems.  So I'm not sure what EQ is doing different
that is causing the lock-up problem.

It MAY be sound-related.  My sound is downright WACKY in EQ (but not
in any other games...)  Sometimes, I can't hear a monster beating on
me at all.  Sometimes, I can -- at way way way too high a volume.
Sometimes the volume is normal.

This doesn't happen in any other games, so I'm at a loss to explain...

All in all, I *do* think there is probably some quality problems in the
EQ client executable............
