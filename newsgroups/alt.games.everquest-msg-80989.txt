I've been using supernews for several years now. Started when my local
provider (at the time) was offering a "news" service that probably could
pick up five groups. Of course, I got in looooong before they got picked
up by Remarq or whoever owns them now. At one point they tried billing
me at some "new rates" (read 'through the roof'). I called and asked. I
was quickly restored to my grandfathered rates. I woulnd't pay what they
are charging for new accounts now, but since I'm still only paying a
couple bucks a month, and they do pick up all the groups I want (and
have added a couple on occasion when I asked) I stick with them.
