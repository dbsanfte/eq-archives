I created my new BST last night, and did some tests.  I tries some really -
bad- names and ones I knew were taken to see how fast they were rejected - 
instantly.  Ok, these names are in their "don't allow" or "already taken" 
dictionary.

Then I tried a name that I wanted: "Ferrous".  Sat there for 15 seconds ( 
give or take 5 ) and finally, it's rejected.  Sheesh.  Logic says that 
someone had to manually reject that one.  Then I tried another one I 
wanted: "Plumbum" and it took about the same amount of time to get 
rejected.  So, I try "Ferrous" again and instant rejection.  Great, it's 
been added to the "bad" dictionary.

Seeing all the fucked up names in the game, some guide or whomever is 
rejecting these things MUST have just been clicking the "Deny" button.  Of 
course, Plumbum could be interpreted as having a purple ass, but there's 
hundreds of names that are hugely more offensive than that out there.

I saw the one guy who has left our guild to go on to a bigger one, and his 
surname is now "Asskickingdorf".  Fucking amazing.
