But apparently they have no qualms about hooking 13 year olds on crack 
and forcing them to go pro in some really seedy areas. Personally... I'd 
rather take the saw than be *that* guy.

You'd have to either be uninformed, or deliberately looking the other 
way to refuse to see that there is a very high likelihood that 
"innocent" (innocent as in "didn't do the crime for which they are being 
executed") people are executed in America.

As to not nearly as heinous? In Iraq what those terrorists did is 
reprehensible, condemnable, and illegal everywhere...even most despots 
would prosecute those people if they caught them. Meanwhile America 
state-sanctions its murders, media outlets profit from the media frenzy, 
and politicians disavow they have any responsibility. At least with the 
terrorists you can point to a face... with the American legal system... 
its just a monumental faceless bureacracy that murders people with 
indifference while the public watches the spectacle like they watch car 
accidents. I think that's a bigger atrocity.
