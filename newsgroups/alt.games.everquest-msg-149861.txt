Necros can do so much more.  At 24th level they get a mezz of sorts, works
great in a pinch.  Necros can slow with Engulfing Darkness  (or upgrade
whatever that might be), offer up some HP using Shadow Compact (I think)-why
keep all that HP for yourself when you can just suck down some more.  Pet
kicks-ass and can be sent to keep adds busy.  Hmmm let me think, oh yeah you
can give away your mana to the cleric if he's low.  Remeber to tap
everything and turn all those HP into mana, hit points for yourself or
someone else.  Necro's also get a resist debuff that can come in handy.

I've only played my necro to 28 but I'm sure it gets even better from there.
