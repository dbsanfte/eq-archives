Not neccessarily faster, since you have to recharm which can take
awhile, and the enchanter pets DO dish it out, besides having a high DS
probably little to no difference. Then there's always the danger of
death especially botting on one computer, which will slow that xp way
down.  I've always been of the opinion if you can use your animation
without it getting creamed it's usually a better option, and the 49 one
is actually better than most mobs you can charm at 49.

What lv is this enchanter?  I don't remember you mentioning, I can
perhaps give some good spots for charming.

I think the animations start duel wielding at 29, but not sure, been a
couple years since my enchanter was that low.
