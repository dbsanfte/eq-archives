Focus on HP, AC, STA, STR, WIS, pretty much in that order.  Later on 
you'll want to throw DEX in near STR as well.  They "should be" as high 
as possible.

> 2: what should by hp/ac be around?

As high as you can get it.

You're only level 32, you're not supposed to be making ungodly amounts of 
plat.  In general, LDON is decent mix of plat, XP and loot.  You might 
also try Dulak's harbor in LOY a little later on.

> 4: what is the best tradeskill for me?

Better question: why do you want to start a tradeskill?  If it's for the 
pure enjoyment of seeing your bank account depleted while making items 
that take forever to sell even at a loss, then by all means start one up.

You are a ranger, so fletching is a natural choice, but expect to start 
paying a lot in the high 100s.  Tailoring can make you some cash, but 
expect to spend a lot of time running around after green spiderlings, and 
even more time sitting in the bazaar trying to hock your leather padding.  
Fishing+Brewing+Smithing is a decent money maker if you can come up with 
the cash to get your smithing to about 122 and make a bunch of embroidery 
needles.  The cultural embroidery needles (I find gnomish the easiest to 
get supplies for) will net you about 5pp each (this really does add up).  
Will net you about 9pp each if you can find the needles on a vendor from 
some other smith making them to practice smithing.

> 5: ideas on how to upgrade my ranger?

Make a magelo profile (www.magelo.com, free registration or $12/yr for 
premium) and post it here so we can see what you're currently wearing and 
perhaps provide some specific upgrades.

> 6: i quested my own armor

Congrats.  Sorry to say that any armor you've quested at 32 (especially 
solo) is probably crap.  With the drops in LDON filtering down, you'll 
proably be able to find some pretty decent stuff for pretty cheap in the 
bazaar.
