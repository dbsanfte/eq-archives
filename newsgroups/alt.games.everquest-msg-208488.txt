I have not seen any posts about the Cursor Key problem...

you press the Num Lock key and autorun and the cursor keys stop working and
start to be used as text controls. you hit the Num Lock again and it is back
to normal.
I have verified this bug is on 3 of my systems on 2 accounts and am
wondering what VI is calling this bug.

Dave
