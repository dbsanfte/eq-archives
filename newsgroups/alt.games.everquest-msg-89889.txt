Monks are damage dealers;  warriors aren't.   Any duo based
on a warrior has to have some way to inflict damage other
than the warrior and/or some way to mitigate damage.  A
warrior/cleric combo can "outlast" a mob.  A warrior/druid
combo can't.

What makes the monk/shaman combo so good is the ability
of the monk to (generally) control pulls and the ability of the
shaman to reduce damage while the monk inflicts a large
amount of damage.

A duo inflicting more than average damage fighting a mob that's
inflicting less than average damage means the shaman can
keep up with the healing required.   And, contrary to the usual
"it's only good up to 50" line, it'll actually work up to 60, as long
as the monk can single-pull and the shaman can slow.
