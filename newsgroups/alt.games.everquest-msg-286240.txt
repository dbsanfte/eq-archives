I've heard of some guild on Bristlebane (Kicking Snakes) that was formed 
specifically to cater to people returning to EQ, but I can't speak for the 
server's population. I *can*, however, tell you that, as an alt-aholic, I 
see more than my share of the low level game, and on Stromm, the population 
is pretty good, relatively speaking, from the tutorial on up.
