I didn't say they won battles, I said they were a dominant part of the
RvR environment. The posting on the class numbers of Nimue, a new
server, that shows Hyberia being roughly 40-50% archer confirmed it.
They're the only ones who can solo RvR, avoid NPC guards and harvest
realm points (or grief) to their hearts content.

Apart from rogue types, but they sound seriously broken.

No thanks. I'm having a great time in EQ. Just finished my second
month and still got a long way to go. Lot's of places I haven't
seen, lots of beasts I haven't fought, lots of loot I want and the
entire high level game still waiting. There is a sizable degree of
`grind' if you want to level fast, but I take periods off to go
hunting or wandering and ignore the Xp bar. In any case, grinding
with a good group is quite entertaining....although finding a group
can be dull.

I suspect it'll take me 6 months at least to explore the world and
play. At that time if DaoC has a stable and happy community, a
growing world and I can afford a new computer i'll play it. I lose
nothing by waiting for DaoC to mature or die.

Of course Luclin on EQ is also waiting for the new computer...
