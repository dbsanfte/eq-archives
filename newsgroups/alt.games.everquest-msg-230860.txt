It wasn't only the pop-ups that drove me nuts - the item search feature
didn't work too well either so l signed up for the premium service.
I keep it running in the back ground - it is really handy to pop between the
screens if l need anything.
I didn't think it cost too much for access given the level of information
you have access too.
