 I'd tell that person to pick one (or tell me which one they didn't
want) because me and my group are heading down. If they still say they
are claiming all three just pick one and park your group there. The
worst thing that will happen is they will petition. The guide will
either laugh at them or tell them to pick one because they can't have
all three. Of course the really good guides will do both.
