    With just a warrior and myself, we held down the entire Upper Dogs
(Tents) camp. No bots for haste, no slows (he didn't bother with his
Truncheon), no C3/C5, just a single elemental warrior and cleric. Think that
might be an attractive option to some people? Two people, fair XP, and a
pile of cash items - sounds like a fun evening! Never mind when we moved
into the castle, and he was tanking four mobs (three of them blue, so
post-55) at once without any worries. But we couldn't do both at once, we
might need to bring in a pair of damage dealers to kill the entire upper
dogs and castle area.

    It's amazing what the AC of an elemental-geared player does to mobs in
the old world. Self-buffed, I, a cleric, am at around 6000 HPs and 1500 AC.
Things just can't hit me. I was tanking Champions in Upper Dogs and soloing
them with maybe 10% mana used by the end of the fight. My potion damage
shield plus MoR reverse damage shield were hitting them for more than they
hit me for. You don't think players like myself would giggle with glee if we
could farm good loot drop places like this and pick up fair XP at the same
time, with almost no risk and no organization ("we need crowd control, a
slower, a MT, a healer....") required?
