That's it. You could always get a port TO one of those places and take the
Nexus there, you know. I got a port to WK, am currently in Qeynos Hills, and
will get back to Freeport by taking the NK spire to the Nexus, going to Gfay,
and running through Butcherblock to take the boat. (Binding myself right
outside the Gfay\Butcherblock entrance\exit and praying the whole time that my
Gather Shadows spell doesn't give out while I'm near guards in Butcherblock)
