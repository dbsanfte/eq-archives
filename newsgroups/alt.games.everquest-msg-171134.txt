Personally, and professionally, I would avoid the Wintendo range of
Operating Systems (Win9x, ME, SE etc).  

That leaves NT (discontinued and useless for gaming anyhow) or Windows
2000 or XP.

Frankly I find XP Home too restrictive, especially if one has a home
network, and I find that since I have installed XP Pro then I have no
problems with anything.  As someone who requires a full network with
domain handling XP Home doesn't do the job at all.

Failing XP Pro I would go for Windows 2000 and if you can't/won't get
that then go for XP Home.
