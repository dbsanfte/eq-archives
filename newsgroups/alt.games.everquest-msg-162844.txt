Personally, mounting a laptop in your car and doing ANYTHING with it
while you drive is stupid. Focus on the road so you don't kill
yourself or anyone else. (Unglue the cel phone from your ear while
you're at it. ><)

On a side note, USA Today once had a poll on activities people do
while driving. One of the top ones listed with a disturbingly large
percentage: Reading. No, not while sitting at red lights. WHILE
DRIVING.
