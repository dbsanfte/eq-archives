And if it isn't agreed upon?  A guy says, "sure, I'll rez ya, drag it
to me," and you're entirely comfortable with a "thanks" and running
off?

May be a matter of style.  I find your way rather sleazy..."sure, I'll
rez you...50pp."

The way I see it, I'm doing you a favor.  If your response to that
favor is a minimal "thanks," then I'm probably not going to be
disposed to do you another favor.

As I made quite clear, I don't agree with that response.

Then you're playing a different EQ than I am.  Most people IME ooc
endlessly for rez's in the zones I'm in until I or someone like me
takes pity on them.

You seem IMO to place undue importance on the terms being stated up
front.  If someone /oocs for a rez, I almost always respond, and if
that person chooses only to say thanks, I shrug.  But if that person
needs another rez, I will certainly be less disposed to do it.

It seems to me only common courtesy that if someone does something for
you, you attempt to see if there's something you can do for him in
turn.

I'd be really interested to hear how often you interrupt what you're
doing to give people free tp's.  People you don't know, that is.

Biz, believe it or not, I have better things to do than to follow your

I should have thought it obvious.  Buffs I can use or money.

No, I'm saying that to expect free rezzes just because you're in the
same zone as the cleric is absurd.

Thanks, I don't need your help with that :)

If he's not in a group it's up to him.  But how often is a cleric
*not* in a group in a zone where someone has died?
