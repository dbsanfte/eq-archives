You've skipped Paladin. You can tank, heal yourself (a little), and save
your butt with Lay on Hands. Consider a ranger too- which can be the
same race as the druid.

Your monk's night blindness can be fixed fairly early on with
infravision spells and light up equipment. (which doesn't help with
corpse runs- but at least you can defend yourself on a corpse run).
Monks have the benefit of feign death which is vital in safe pulling.

Rogue is not recommended as a main tank- they need to sneak behind the
mob for backstab.

My fav duo is monk/shaman. We are best fighting blues together, but we
can kick serious tail.
