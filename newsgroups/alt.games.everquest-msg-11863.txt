All of the above?

I guess Charles Whitman would be the archetype of the sort of person I was
thinking of.

Highly conversant with firearms, capable of holding a grudge, fantasies of
shooting a lot of people.

Others I was thinking of were;
Thomas Hamilton, killed 16 people (mostly children) in Scotland.
Michael Ryan, killed 16 people in England.
Martin Bryant, killed 35 in Australia.

Perhaps the media have led me into thinking that these were all alike, when
in reality they were quite different, but from what I have read, they seem
to have quite a few things in common.

Taras Bulba.
