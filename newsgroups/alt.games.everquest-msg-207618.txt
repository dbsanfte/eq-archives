Two problems with that:

1.  When I really feel a need for such a button is when I'm
killing mass quantities of things farming (for example, gathering
smithing components on the islands of Hollowshade Moor).  It's
most efficient to make a train of 20+ mobs, then stand in one
place killing them all, before I start looting the heap of corpses.
And although I sometimes speed this up with a Druid friend using
AoE on them, it's still the most efficient way to do it when it's
just my Paladin and he has to hack them all to death.  Now I'm
faced with trying to loot my way through a pile of a few dozen
corpses to get the few that have the components I need.  I actually
need to *clear* each corpse so that I can go on to loot the
corpses "underneath" it (and to make sure I haven't missed any).
/Hidecorpse does not help with that, it would make *all* the
pile invisible to me, and defeat the purpose.

2.  I try to keep kill areas clean for the sake of others,
not just myself.  Not everyone uses the /hidecorpse command
on a regular basis, and it's still polite for me to actually
*remove* the corpses instead of just hide them from *my* view.

Also, as someone else pointed out, at least for a long time
you could still accidentally loot "invisible" corpses.  If they
fixed that, good, but I haven't checked it personally.
