It's not an Everquest thing, but real shamans often deal in
interpreting dreams (their own or others), going on "spirit quests"
(often associated with peyote or other hallucinogenic drugs) which are
pretty much dreams, and so on.  Everquest doesn't really make much of
this, they just took the bit about dealing with spirits and being
healers for their people and dropped the weird stuff.

I can't say I've noticed many dream references in shaman names in EQ,
either, but then I haven't been looking for them and usually don't pay
much attention to peoples surnames (because they're so often stupid
and annoying).
