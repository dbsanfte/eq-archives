To me it looks like you are making this more complex than it is.
I have HIGH HIGH set under security in zone alarm, and when I start EQ
after a patch I'm just prompted to let EQ connect (and I click to
remember that for next time) I don't have to configure any kind of IP
or anything. Do you have some kind of special connection where you
have to do this?
