If you enter Thundering Steppes from Antonica, follow the road around 
until you reach a guard tower at a crossroads. Backtrack a short way, 
and there's a dirt track running off the main road into the hills, which 
leads down into the docks.

This leads you to Nektulos Forest, which should lead you to the Commonlands.
