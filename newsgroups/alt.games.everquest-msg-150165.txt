Necro couldn't take the hits on a pull where FD was essential. SKs
already make great pullers. A monk who isn't pulling, still has a viable
role as a damage dealer, and multiple monks add to the group.

Sure, but they fill the multiple slots available for damage. Melee
damage output is scalable up to about 100, only then do more of the same
have a reduced benefit, due to hit bubbles.

The difference is that most other classes can add to group efficiency
if there's already someone else there doing their primary job. 

Bards, Encs, SK/Pal less so, but no-one as little as a warrior. If
someone is already tanking, the warrior becomes a burden. Clerics had
that stigma, but were given tools specifically to combat it.

If you don't have a cleric in the group, routinely using CH, a monk or
SK will be a comparable tank almost every time. If not tanking, a
warrior has only pitiful damage output to contribute.

Firstly, they need to extend the gap between warriors and other classes
in tanking exp mobs and 'easier' raids, and at the same time, increase
pal/sk's tanking as the backup of choice. Make plate worthwhile. Monks
have a unique role (FD pulling), a strong secondary role (large damage
output), and currently also overlap into tanking. They shouldn't come
ever remotely close to plate classes in tanking.

Secondly, they need to give warriors a viable 'scalability' similar to
what they've done with clerics. On raids, more than 4 warriors are more
than you need for the majority of situations. We've been comfortable in
VT with just 2 warriors. On some raids we've had 12. What did those
other 10 contribute other than piddly damage output and the same 'oh
fuck' regularity use as summon corpse.
