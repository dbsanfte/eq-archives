Ok.  After some some good feedback the problem seems to be related to those
of us who enjoy running EQ in windowed mode instead of full screen.  I run
in windowed mode all the time because it allows me to get back to my windows
desktop quicker.  When I ran DirectX 8.1,  I could adjust the Gamma inside
of a windowed everquest screen.  After upgrading to DirectX 9 I lost that
ability.

The techs at sony will not help you with video problems if you are running
DirectX 9.  They say that EQ only officially supports DirectX 8.1
