If the "he' in there refers to Ragefire, i'm sure there's
hundreds of clerics who would like to know.  And, yes,
Lodizal is on a set timer.  He's also an old, Velious
spawn.

No other mob is the cleric epic bottleneck, of course.  After
all, Ragefire is the *only* difficult part of the entire quest.
And it's not like they've had this type of issue with any other
mob anyway.

Nonsense.  Ragefire is arguably the most contested mob in the
game.  He's not too difficult so he's in range of even medium
guilds.  He's the bottleneck for the one epic *every* guild
wants at least one of, if not more.   Porting to Skyfire two
minutes after spawn time if his spawn time was known would
be just in time to see who actually killed him.  I sure can't
think of another mob that's engaged within 10 minutes of spawn
time consistently.  (I play on a FCFS server and there's no
"camping" Ragefire or list for it.)
