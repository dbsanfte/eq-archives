You bitch because they take too long to get to your petition.

You bitch because they say, "hey you dumbasses out there...if you petition
about shit that's slowing us down and we can't do anything about, you're
keeping us from answering Beebop's petition in a timely manner, so cut it
out!"

I guess there's just no winning with you, huh?

Now, had you said Verant is CHEAP, I would agree with you.  One sure cure of
"bad" CS is hiring more people.
