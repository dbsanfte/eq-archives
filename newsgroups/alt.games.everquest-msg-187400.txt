I was hoping someone may have the answers to these questions (I tried asking
some things in the game but no one replied). By the way, I have EQ and the
first two packs and like playing fighter types:


I'm a very new character and I'm not sure how to even approach the game, I
mean, all I do is kill monsters and pick up "no-drop" items - what do I do
with them all?

Is there an easy way to find where a bind point is?

Are there some sort of in-game maps (because I keep getting lost)?

When I talk to an NPC, do I really have to type out lots of things by hand,
or is there a short cut? Sometimes, I have to type something in many times
before I happen to hit upon the response that they want to hear, and I don't
like that.

Is there some sort of way to have the game 'remember' my current quests, or
do I really have to use pencil and paper (despite the fact I have an 80gig
HD).

Is there a way to heal my man above 50% (apart from gaining many levels)?

When a monster is getting the upper hand, there seems to be no way to outrun
it (and you can't always guarantee that you're near a Guard or a Zone
point). So, do I have to die each time, then run miles to get my corpse?

It seems to take an age to memorise and scribe a scroll - is there a way to
hurry it up?


Well, that's all from me, thanks for any help.
