Try casting a 50+ buff directly on a lower level character - now,
tell me why SOE designed it not to work?  They didn't intend for
lower levels to have access to post 50 buffs.  The fact that using
a group buff gets around it is obviously unintended.  Not an 
exploit mind you, because we aren't warned about it, but definitely
not the intended game mechanic.  I'd expect to see them eventually
cause these buffs to simply not stick to lower levels rather than
use targetting to accomplish it (which didn't work).  Why we haven't
see this solution earlier is a mystery to me, perhaps it required
another change to the spell datastructure (and they had plenty of
problems the last time they did that to give more slots for effects,
so they could have better control over stacking).
 
I'm a big fan of KEI (actually, a bigger fan of tranq) but they are
both appropriate to someone of my level.  I was ecstatic when our
guild chanters got C2, made raids and xp groups with them so much
nicer.  I was just as ecstatic at 45 to group with a 'chanter who
knew her stuff (and the huge improvement C1 gives at that level
was obviously nice too).

I wish they'd implement a recommended level style mechanism on buffs,
so that if you're way below the appropriate level you don't get the
full benefit, just as they've done for gear and haste caps (which are
level dependent).
