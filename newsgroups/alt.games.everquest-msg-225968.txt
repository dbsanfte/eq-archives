Thank you.

Right.  I will probably get some for a while, just because I can!  But I 
will also look at forthcoming spells at 53/53 and if I think I cannot 
live without them I may well stick to regular XP.

Indeed.  Only friend I have is l52 so he won't be running away from me 
in levels either :)

Thanks.
