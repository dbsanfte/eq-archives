Planes are just like boats, no cast zones, so you better ask a friendly mage
to conjure you some focus item so your levitate stays on longer.
And just hope the the flight doesn't outlast the duration of the spell :)

And if you are bringing any weapons on board hide them in a dimensional
hole, also summoned by the friendly mage, the security X-rays cannot
penetrate
the magical nature of those bags so you can safely carry on any sharp pointy
things needed for fendning off any kobolds or orcs on the flight.
