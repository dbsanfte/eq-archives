make cheaper arrows... if you need a better bow, either run the trueshot
quest untill you make it, or gather your courage and head over to trak's
teeth near the emerald jungle zone, and find people killing the frogs for
the seb key, they drop a fairly good nodrop bow (Spectral Bow) on a regular
basis. 1/150 arrows are about all you want to use for general purpose
pulling.

weapons... either cheap or easy to get if you're willing to travel...

Blackened Alloy Long Sword from Runny eye. they're lore 10/29. Ask the
farmers if you can loot if an extra one drops.

Icetooth Claws from Great Divide. Common as hell drop, and lore 11/29. they
either rot or go to pets or get shouted to zone when they drop.  if you dont
want to travel all the way to GD, they also sell fairly cheap.

There's probably more, these are what I can come up with off the top of my
head.

The PGT has a nifty proc that can save your butt at lower levels if it procs
at the right time, but you're starting to outgrow it. The sarnak claws have
a really really bad damage/delay ratio. You're almost better off replacing
the claw with a velium weapon, at least that way you get the extra 15 or so
damage from the proc.

Another option is to save up and go shopping for a 2 handed weapon. You'll
live longer. You should be able to pick up a Runic Carver, a Blade of Xalgoz
or a 2 handed practice sword for a reasonable price. A poor untwinked ranger
probably doesnt want the extra taunt from 1 handed weapons...

Find some strength jewlry. Jagged Bands, Orc Fang Earrings. something along
those lines (decent stats, common as hell = cheap). As long as Feet like Cat
puts you above 125 agi, you can sacrifice some of that to up strength. Dex
too, unless you end up with a proc'ing weapon.

If you choose to go the cheap route and run around collecting rotting
weapons, suffer with what you have until 30 when you get SoW.
