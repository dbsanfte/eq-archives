Thanks for th reply. thats sorta brief tho, any chanace for an
amplification? Maybe a litttle more detail. I have a lvl 69 war tht I
need to take there to do part of the new Epic 1.5 and 2.0..Never got
around to doing The oiginal epic. Started this guy when Lucin came out
and there were better weapons available, histoy may repeat it's self
in this rergard..........
