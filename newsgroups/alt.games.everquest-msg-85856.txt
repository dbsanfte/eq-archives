If you're going to be gone "a couple of months," first thing you need
to do is take all of your hard-won gear, even the good stuff...
and sell it.

Sell it for the most you can get.  Don't get attached to it.  Sell it.

When you come back 3 months later you can sit in your server's
auction zone and buy all of it back and still have a LOT of cash
left over.
