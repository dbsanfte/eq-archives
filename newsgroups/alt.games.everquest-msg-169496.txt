Well.... Once you have the 'risk' down with practice risk generally becomes
pretty meaningless. And frankly for time spent his reward beats the crap
out of, say, doing 2 bosses in Vex Thal and wiping ... not that I'm
bitter. Oh no. Fscking Clerics roaming up to the 'pretty windows'.

I prefer to compare 'time spent' to reward, really.

I dont think you can quite compare bloods honor bracer and blood cord (the
two things he dropped for us last time) to a taskmasters pouch in terms of
legitimate motivation...

Yeah, well, it was just a suggestion. You're probably right.

No no no you completely misunderstand me. My point is I wouldnt support them
killing an 'interim' blood with no loot that was solely an Emperor trigger
mob, but I find it hard to say they shouldnt kill something they can that
dropped items that were significant for them because another guild wanted
to farm the triggered pop - especially when the respawn is a matter of mere
hours.

Agreed.

What address should I send them to for said blowing?

I dont know really. I'll suggest it. I suspect it may just be a case of 'we're
busy with POP and vex thal and farming ytrium doesnt appeal' or something.

Well, that motivates me more than loot honestly. Badass mobs = Very Good thing.
