Killing stuff in POG, we fought a couple silencing mobs that were
a little annoying.  Killed them before with my cleric, we used
the "hide the casters over there" system, which is great unless
some idiot comes running for heal while low enough on HP to get
low HP aggro and drag the silence caster along.

At any rate, this time I was playing my bard.   Silence prevents
bard songs from being sung as well, I found, sadly, on the first
mob.   Second mob got pulled from the wrong direction and managed
to silence me before I could target it for OOS... not sure I can
pull that off anyway but wanted to try.

At any rate, I dove in in melee mode, since I was silenced
anyway... and noticed something funny.  I wasn't twisting, since
I knew already that wouldn't work.. but Cantata was up anyway.
Seems whatever song I'm running when silenced can still be sung
as long as I never stop it.

Now on a previous visit to POG, a bard I was grouped with was
removing silences after the fight, by running a cancel magic
song.  I think I somehow missed buying that one, the targetable
version definately didn't work, but there's apparantly a group
one that will.

My thought is, I could turn -that- song on and keep it running,
which would allow casters to come close to me to get silenced
stripped back off as needed during a fight.  Of course this would
require them to be able to operate without buffs, or with dummy
buffs up protecting their "good" buffs, since the song would
strip everything off given long enough.    But it looks like an
interesting tactical tool to explore.

ps what -is- that song?
