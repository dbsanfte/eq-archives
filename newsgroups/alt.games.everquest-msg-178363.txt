Make a new Ogre character. Log it off. Log on your main. type /consent 
NewbieOgre. Log off again. Log new Ogre in again. Leg it to Rathe 
Mountains (you will die a few times in the way, but who cares). Find the 
corpse. Drag it using /corpse as close to the zoneline as you can. Log 
in main character again. Beg port to Feerott, or run to shop and buy PoP, 
or just walk again. Loot corpse. Be more careful in the future. :P
