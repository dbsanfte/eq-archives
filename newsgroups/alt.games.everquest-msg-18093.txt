The difference is that if it is a looted weapon, you have very little time
invested in it.  And anyone else who kills that monster can get one. 
However, if the monster if very rare, or the weapon only drops rarely, the
price will be higher.  And if the item has nice stats, that will also
increase the price.  And the number of them available, or the ease with
which high level characters can get them also affect the price.  So, Runed
Totem staves are fairly worthless, because the market is flooded with
them.  On the other hand, Slime Crystal staves are still fairly pricy,
because King Xorbb is fairly uncommon, and because not many people bother
to hunt in the Gorge.  Thus, if you wanted a Slime Crystal Staff, you
should expect to pay a lot for it, or go get it yourself.  If you find
someone who is selling it cheap, then be quiet and pay promptly.

With Tradeskills, especially at skill levels greater than 200, the player
may have literally *days* invested in clicking the Combine button, and
possibly thousands and thousands of PP spent on materials and failures. 
Since there is very little competition at the highest level of skill,
Grandmasters can charge whatever the market will bear.  (And since each
character can only get to 250 in one tradeskill, there might only be a few
characters on a given server that are at that skill level in that
particular skill.  I've talked to more than a few Enchanters that are a bit
pissed that all the other tradeskills are suddenly useful and valuable,
since they'd already Grandmastered in Jewlery.  On the other hand,
Enchanters are still the only ones that can cast a lot of the spells
needed, so they don't exactly get left out of the loop, profit-wise.)
