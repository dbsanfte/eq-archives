Thats all immaterial.

If I bought a Cray, and asked some programmers to write a grahpics
intensive game program I could play on it, I would expect them to
use as many of the CPUs as possible. I would be interested in the
computer's total speed. Its immaterial what the speed of one of cpus
might be, unless all of them were slow.

So what ? That has nothing to do with what I wanted, if I could
afford a Cray.

Yes, I know that. I mentioned it numerous times.

I don't need any help. Here is why. I'm talking about total
available speed in a Cray X1, its teraflops. I don't care what the
speed of one cpu might be, unless its going bad or all of them are
slow.

Its nospam that has the fetish about 'flops per cpu', not me.
