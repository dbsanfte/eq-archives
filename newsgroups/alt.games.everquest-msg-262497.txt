The media anymore is not to be believed.  I have friends in Iraq and
all of them, without exception, have said that the media's reporting
is an injustice to what is really happening over there.  This comes
from enlisted and officers, small poll I admit since I don't know that
many, but all of their buddies say the same thing.

There's a few things here I want to comment on.  First, Bush is not
backwards or a simpleton.  You don't get degrees from Harvard and Yale
by being a dolt, no matter who your father is.
Second, the world was a dangerous place before, he just opened our
eyes to it and got us involved in a way we never were before, but the
rest of the world has been.  Not an invading army of course but
dealing with terrorist acts and the nations that harbor them.

I think the real problem is there is no dealing with those people.
They have been fighting someone for 10,000 years and will continue to
fight until it's all over.  If not an outsider they fight internally.
I had a friend from Iran who explained it like this:

Brother will fight brother
they will band together to fight their father
they will all band together to fight the uncle and his family
they will all band together to fight the next village
etc....

The point of this,imo, is there are only 2 ways to deal with them;
leave them alone entirely or wipe them out.  There's no middle ground,
and history has proved that time and time again.
