Jennai,

The brain vs brawn is raid 'leadership and organization' vs 'the folks 
who follow instructions to get the job done'.

Now I'm not saying the brawn group is a collection of idiot morons. I'm 
saying simply that they are not particularly more skilled than an 
important segment of the non-raiding players.

However, the brawn group of a raid (-most of it-) gets far greater gear 
rewards than similiarly competent non-raiding players with similiar time 
investments.

The argument is revolving around the idea that raiders do harder things 
so raiders should get greater rewards. The reality, imo, is that the 
raid leaders do harder things, and the vast majority of the actual 
raiders tend to have a comparatively easy time of it... easier than even 
the more challenging single group/solo content that non raiders contend 
with (in vastly inferior gear).

So there is no good reason to reward them so richly for just performing 
their job with adequate competency. Non raiders frequently have to 
perform their job with the same or greater competency to survive, and 
the rewards are dramatically smaller.

At any rate this has nothing to do with 'tanks'.
