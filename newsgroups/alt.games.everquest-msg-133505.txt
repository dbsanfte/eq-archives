Hiya, thought I should introduce myself since I am (hopefully) going to be
around a bit..
Steven here.. had an EQ account a few months ago, actually one for me and
one for my wife Sara.
Long story.. crooked contractor,homeless shelter, etc...
So now we are almost stable enough to get our EQ going again. Waiting on a
couple more hardware upgrades. ANYWAYYY thought I should check a few NG's to
catch up on all I have missed, and get some advice on a server to start our
new chars on etc... we like the hack and slash but spend about as much time
socializing and on tradeskills too.. not hardcore levelers really(well the
wife is hehe) sorry I am so long winded (really I am!) but the more info you
folks have, the ones that will actually make some sensible replies, the
better.
Last but not least, We are still kind of new to the NG stuff so please feel
free to let me know the rules and correct me if I make any mistakes.. which
I am sure I will.

OK DONE.
thanks
Steven
Aren't you glad I didn't say banana again?
