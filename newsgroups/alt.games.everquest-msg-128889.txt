Your skill at Dodging the question has increased!(53)

You still haven't explained why you don't like the meaningless -int, you
just say "oh, I answered you, the +str helps encumberance".

Anyone who runs around trying to hunt with a pile of loot and cash on them
is an idiot, it takes all of 10 minutes max to gate into misty, run to the
Rivervale bank, gate back to wherever you're hunting, med back the mana, and
start killing again at maximum(unencumbered) efficiency.  Oh, and I even
hunted last night with 2500pp cash on me (on purpose) to see how big of a
deal it was, during this time, I soloed my first 4-arm in ME (their RvR is
broken), and finally found the Akheva entry hall uncamped and killed Centi
Dators for 2 hours;  while encumbered.  I didn't notice any differences from
normal "stuff I haven't killed before" difficulty and it's normal "cast gate
10 times in as many minutes" factor

Ok, go solo an Elysian using only gauntlet snare, it's a pain in the ass and
probably fatal.  Try quad-kiting anything that isn't green using the
gauntlet snare, it's a pain in the ass and potentially fatal.  Try
root/dotting anything with over 5khp using only gauntlet snare, I guarantee
it will wear off right after you get 3 roor resists in a row, which can be
potentially fatal.

Need resists?  Having negative sv on an item means that even with the buff,
you still have lower resists than if you didn't have the item.  And we'll
see how well cure disease works on your corpse when you get a necro add that
starts chain casting disease dots on you and poison nuking you.  If you
think that resist gear is something you can stick in the bank and run and
grab out when you find out you're going to kill a dragon, well, you're
ignorant.  I'm sure you switch out your paw every 36 seconds when charm
breaks too, since charisma affects charm effectiveness.
