If I delete my 19th ranger, can I turn around and use the same name on
another character?  His stats are very bad (not knowing anything about stats
at creation I distributed them evenly among 5-6 areas when I should have put
them mostly into str so he could get decent armor).  His strength is now to
the point where he can carry very little and his banded armor will put him
close to encumbered (I think it is 85 but I am not positive).  If I delete
him, can I create another wood elf ranger with better stats and use the same
name?  While he was my first character, I have played 2 others past him and
would like to go back and give him another try with better stats and see how
it works out.  Now that I know what to hunt and some good quests to do,
leveling him back should not be that hard.

Thanks in advance for the info.

Charles
