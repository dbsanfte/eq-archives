Why is war their only considered option?  They've had multiple UN
resolutions, signficant support from the UN Security Council and
support for mediated talks from all the major powers, excepting
China..

Could is just possibly be that they don't actually want peace?  After
fifty years and one failed war after another, you have to begin to
wonder.

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
