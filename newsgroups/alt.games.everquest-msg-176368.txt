IMHO a fungi on a warrior is nonsense unless you need to solo your
warrior, and have e. g. cobalt in his other slots to hit the AC
softcap at low levels.  At 45 it becomes virtually obsolete with the
100 HP heal on the cobalt BP, with vastly superior stats.
I could see the use of fungis on monk or shaman twinks, again to
inhance the solo abilites, but anyone past level 50 wearing a fungi
better play someone that never gets hit (what in turn makes the fungi
obsolete again).
