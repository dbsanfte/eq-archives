I am now collecting HQ cat pelts for the quivers at 115 as well as
crystalline silk for skilltrivials between 102 and 131. Wu pieces start at
120 or so I think and top at 158.
Rest is velious tailoring and a serious pain in the butt.

btw. I'm running around with 306 silks swatches (15 stacks + 6 single ones)
and now kind of trying to find an enchanter who has Thicken Mana and a lot
of time left. Anyone available on the AB server?
