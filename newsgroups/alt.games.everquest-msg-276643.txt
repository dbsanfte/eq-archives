Other than rumors, I have never heard from anyone who has actually seen a 
GM spawn any mob.  GMs can kill off mobs, but, to the best of my 
knowledge, they cannot spawn them.

It's quite possible he is not allowed to answer the question, or also 
possible he does not know.  Either way, yes, it would have been nice if 
he just said so rather than give that long explanation that does not 
answer the question, or even answer whether or not he can answer the 
question.
