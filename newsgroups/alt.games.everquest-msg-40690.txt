Not to be offensive or anything, but take your sanctimonious horseshit and
cram it up your ass. You can't tell me what I can and cannot post. Don't
like what I write? Either post a correction with a rational explanation, or
go fuck yourself with a chainsaw, I don't care which you choose.

BTW, it would be of great benefit to you if you pulled your head out of
your ass long enough to read:
========
Bear in mind that I am not omniscient, and this is a work in progress. I
don't play all classes, so a given class may have a better (or worse)
rating than I give it, simply because there is some aspect of the class I'm
not totally familiar with. Also, if anyone can think of any more good
categories to add (I'm sure I've missed a couple), by all means lemme know.
Just please don't send a faction recommendation, because there are too many
factors beyond class that affect this.
