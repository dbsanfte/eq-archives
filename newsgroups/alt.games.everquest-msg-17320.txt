Ahh..

Unfortuanately my ISP's newsfeed is very poor so I, pretty much, only read
and post from work. I remember a thread like that ages ago but lost track of
it, another problem is that if I miss the start of a large thread I don't
often join in because I won't have the time to read back all the posts, I am
meant to be working here, doesn't always happen but I try, sometimes :ï¿½)
