Huh?

Take two one-handed weapons:
1) Dmg 15; Dly 15
2) Dmg 20; Dly 20

Both have exactly the same 1:1 ratio.  If there were no damage bonus,
both weapons would do equivalent DPS.  However once there is a damage
bonus added, the faster weapon gains the advantage because the bonus is
added equally to both, regardless of delay.

Has this changed or been somehow proven wrong lately?
