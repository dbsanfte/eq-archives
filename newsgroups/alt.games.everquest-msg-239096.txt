Way before that.  "Jason and the Argonauts", 1963.

Clearly the author of the funny video was thinking of the same
scene/movie, because he titled it "A Tribute to Ray Harryhausen".
Harryhausen was the special effects wizard (and associate producer)
for that film, and he was pretty much single-handedly responsible
for the "skeleton warriors" scene that is considered a classic.
They were done with stop-motion animation of miniature models,
like much of the original "King Kong", and the later "California
Raisins".  What was groundbreaking in J&tA was mixing the shots
of the animated skeletons with the live-action actors fighting
them.

The "YMCA skeletons" pop up and dance in a setting quite similar
to the one in "Jason and the Argonauts".
