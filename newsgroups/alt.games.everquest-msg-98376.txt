lol its an addiction...  and the 10 bucks isn't so much, I just wanna play..
its got nothing to do with affording, or nothing better to do. I just wanna
play, and get a few things I want to do done.. I can tell that there are at
least 2 people that get more enjoyment from tryin' to put others down rather
then trying to be understanding.. I said I was just sounding off.  Not that
it matters my frustration was also partly from my ISP going down.. So in
reality its not all from EQ. and for the first reply "Time works just fine
in my world.. "   It works better when I am playin' EQ. but it works.  :)
lol
