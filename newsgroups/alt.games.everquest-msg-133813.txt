}Anyone got any good eq cheats they can share?

High level players have lots of stuff that they never use, and they really 
want to give it to you.  They made this a biteasier with the new bazaar 
code that was just added.  Go find a high level player, target them, and 
type /d (for donate).  That opens them up like a merchant with the stuff 
you are free to take.
