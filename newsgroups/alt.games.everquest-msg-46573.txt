I started a dwarf pally. He knew Dwarvish like a master, and Gnomish was
an option to speak- but his skill was 1. I could train in Human with my
trainer, and Human became my default language- although with a skill of
3, nobody could understand me.

I played for an hour in GFay with 48 folks in zone. Heard 6 auction
lines. Had a few conversations in say with wood elves, gnomes and high
elves, that could be understood in context and by repeating ourselves.
No language increases at all.

Very quiet. Unnerving.
