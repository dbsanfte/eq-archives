The GoD staff looks really pretty, sitting in my bank, useless, taking up
space that could be best utilized for something else. Should probably delete
it soon. :) As for the shield, I've not bothered trying to get it; who needs
another worthless item taking up space?

On the other hand, I had problems getting the Al Kabor (whatever it's
called) satchel with LDoN. I contacted Sony tech support via email, and
within a lightning fast 2 weeks, I had my satchel and an apology. The
satchel was worth it; the staff and shield, IMHO, aren't worth the trouble,
but then again, I have yet to visit the 'new continent' and use the faction
modifier. :P
