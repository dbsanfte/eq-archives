    Not really sure about what you mean by "Critical mass" at a delay of 31
and above there.

    WMBS is the highest DPS droppable knight weapon in the game, to my
knowledge. The only disadvantage of the incredibly low delay is more
ripostes, which I personally believe to be an overstated issue.

    Although one of my earrings and neither of my bracers add stamina, they
provide excellent resists, which is one area I've compromised on. (the cloak
and shoulders are a good/bad example of that)

    I'm kinda taken aback that nobody commented on the ceramic gavel of
justice ;)

James
