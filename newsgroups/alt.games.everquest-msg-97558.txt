The only change is that the broken faction messages no longer cause an error
when it hits them.

In fact, it will actually repair the broken messages, stripping out the CR
or joining the two lines back into one, whichever is necessary.

More info:
When they fixed the faction messages, they broke them again - faction
messages written to the log have a CR character at the end of the name.

Yes, I bugged it, and I urge each and every one of you to bug it, too.

Since text file lines are terminated with a CR/LF, this usually doesn't
cause any problems other than faction names in the report have one of those
little block control characters at the end.

BUT.  If you edit the log for some reason, some text editors will
"helpfully" translate the CR to a CR/LF pair, splitting one line into two,
and that will cause an error and the message to not be processed.

The program will now understand either case.
