Aye, badly mismanaging.    Coal / sandpaper / candles / filaments cost 6cp
each.  Those and water (6cp as well) are all you need to buy.    Don't buy
tempers from a vendor, 4 for 48 copper.  Instead buy 6cp water, 6cp candle,
and *make* 4 tempers for a total investment of 12cp.   You will have made a
profit and at the same time gotten *more* artisian exp than if you'd made a
pristine tin bar, since its a level 3 artisian combine instead of a level 2.

Which, of course, raises the question of why you're grinding them?    On my
new warrior, I made two backpacks (including the subcombines) and by the time
I was finished I was level 8 artisian and 6 silver richer (after 2s in fuel
costs) than when I began.  I now have supplies for 5 more backpacks, and I
expect to be level 10 and 16 silver richer by the end of the night.

(Unfortunately I wasn't able to get the backpacks pristine.  Still working on
that, but even normal level quality gives 6 slot 5 percent weight reducing.
Which will sell fast at 4s each, and slowly at 6s each.)
