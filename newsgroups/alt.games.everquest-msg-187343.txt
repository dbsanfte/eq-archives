Finally, we agree. It's all about context.

Excuse Me?! Have you ever taught? Do you know what it's even like to
teach high school kids? Find loopholes and excuse? I'm trying to
explain how even your name can get banned if someone tried by changing
the context of the name.. And that certain times "guidelines" can be
vague .  And as far as the Charles Manson thing, yes, the guy should
have his named changed if is in "context", like you said, to Manson
i.e. Charles Monsoon, Chuck Manson, Charlie Mansin, Charley Monsin.
Like I said " Rana Rene" would be OK to you right? No problem if you
saw a frog with that name, yet it is "Kermit the Frog" in spanish. Is
it then banable? I mean it is not easily recognized yet on the other
hand it is.
