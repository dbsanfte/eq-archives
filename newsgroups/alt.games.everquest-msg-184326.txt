    That happens with the plaguebones sometimes, too, if you set up towards
a corner of the building like I do. I find that if I land darkness I can
walk them out of the building without taking many risks. The spectres come
pre-snared almost, so even though those passages are a little twisty that
might be an option. I soloed the spectres in Oasis at one of the last levels
they were blue on my cleric (48?), and they didn't seem to cast enough that
it would be a concern when "guiding" them outside.
