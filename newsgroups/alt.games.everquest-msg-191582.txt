Actually from what I've read, they didn't have any idea that it was missing
till long after and don't really know at what point it was looted.  It would
be a very unusual raid if no one went LD at any time, wouldn't it?  Might be
that Martin didn't make the connection because no one wants to think that
someone in their guild is a sackoshit.  Maybe someone did think of it, but
didn't want to say anything that could tarnish reputations when there is no
evidence to back it up.
