This is something I want, but not for server transfers.  I want it because
I am tired in MMORPGs of spending 30 freaking minutes at character select
screens trying to come up with a good name that I like that isn't already
taken.  Here's what I want:

    1. First names do not have to be unique on a server.

    2. First name/last name combination has to be unique across
    all servers (makes moves easier, either voluntary or if they
    ever have to do a server merge).

    3. For /tells, etc., you specify first name and enough of last
    name to disambiguate.

    4. The client should allow simple name macros, so that if you know,
    say, three, Soandsos, you can call them Soandso1, Soandso2, and Soandso3,
    rather than having to use their last names.  So, you have to use the last
    name once when setting this up, but then you can use the SoandsoN form.
