I'd logged out in place in TM at the zone line to Gunthak.  Logged back
in, no aggro (which I'd surmised but its nice to know.)

Looking ahead, there was only a single miner up, not the miner plus
guard we'd seen zoning in first time.  Well, I had chanter haste on
still, heck, pull it.

He comes single, I fight near the zone line... and at end of fight I'm
at about 95%, having hit a low of 90%, but I had the time finishing him
off as a snared runner to regen up the rest.

Looking forward, guard is a roamer coming my way; pull him, he takes me 
down to about 80% (and back to 85% by the time he's dead).  He drops a 
gleaming ore.  One down.

There's a 65 wizard in the zone, other than him I'm all alone.  I ask 
him if he's farming gleaming ore for someone or an alt, he's not.  I 
shoot him a link to the one I got and ask for a shout if he sees one he 
doesn't plan to loot.  He points out that its no drop, concerned that 
since its for a chanter quest spell which will also be no drop, this 
effort is going to be wasted... but I assure him that the MQ will work 
fine, chanter handing in Enchanted Gold Bar for her part.

Haste drops, but my self haste is in place, I move up and right, two 
miners seem widely seperated; I snare one and return to the zone line, 
eventually he wanders up to me, alone.

He takes me to 80% (and back up to 85%).  I heal up and go pull his 
buddy.  Same story.  Another roamer guard, he takes me to 60% (65%), I 
heal up and then go the other direction, find two miners, and try my 
single pull again; no luck, his buddy comes for me at full speed.

Well I run to zone line, wait and tank the buddy for a few rounds, then 
zone out and back in.  Original mob is standing in the hall back towards 
the room I pulled from, his buddy is back at his start spot but the 
first guy is standing till his snare runs out.  So he's easy to single 
pull now.

Finish him off, finish his buddy off, definately getting the hang of 
this now... wizard sends tell he has my drop for me.  I take a cloudy 
potion and move up to his spot near the bridge; he's been AE kiting 
there so going thru 4 for every one I kill, I figured his odds of a drop 
were better than mine.

WE chat a bit, then I tip him 10pp for a TL out, which is silly as 
neither of us care about 10pp, but I see it as a polite gesture for him 
to turn down or not as he will.

Later that day, my enchanter friend logged on, we got her a gold bar... 
she ended up having to buy 5 because her spell wouldn't work on just 
one.  Anyway, then off to Gunthak, where I handed in the two orbs, then 
she handed in the enchanted bar and got her ring.  Went to Erud and 
handed in the ring and got her spell, then off to POJ to put it to use, 
where it was a big boost to her mana regen rate.
