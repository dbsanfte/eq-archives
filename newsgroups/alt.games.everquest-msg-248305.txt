I agree that with the client crashes that EQ is having they are at real
risk.  However EQ is EQ and when you like it you really like it.  So many
folks go out and put themselves in debt to try and upgrade when it is EQ
itself that is the problem.

I also play on Innoruuk and have spent almost 2 full days trying to figure
out what is wrong.  I am very frustrated with EQ and Sony.  This may be the
straw for me.
