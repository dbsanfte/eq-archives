Haven't shopped for them in 10 years.

*shakes Sean's hand* Nice to have finally met my overman when it 
comes to sucky vision; - 10 here. I wear kinda big glasses instead of
the fashionable ones with smaller glasses since I can't stand having
my field of vision impeded (I don't have tunnel vision, after all),
and if I look sideways out of the glasses, there's a slight distortion
of both dimensions and colors - blue towards the inside, red towards
the rim of the glass. If my eyes weren't naturally large, the way my
glasses shrink them would make me look like a freak :) (Also, would be
much worse if I didn't pay a small mint for special glass to avoid as
much distortion and reflection as possible)

On the bright side, it's been 4 years since I needed new glasses. I
think I'm going to contact the new lasik place here and see if they
can do anything about me. (By the way, I heard about a procedure for
extreme nearsightedness where they replace the lens instead of
refocusing the cornea, and that works down to -20 or more)
