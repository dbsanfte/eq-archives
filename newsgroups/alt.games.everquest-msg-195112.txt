lol they took down the last message that said that maintenance was 
extended until 10 am PSt and replaced it with "The scheduled maintenance 
for EverQuest has been extended. Please check back for status updates."

I don't really care bout the downtime but I would love them to be honest 
for once and just say " damn we screwed up alot with the maintenance and 
  our original guesstamite of 6 hours was wayyyyyyyyyy off. "
