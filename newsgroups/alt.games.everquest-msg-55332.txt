Most likely, because they have never heard of those places.

Besides, although there are countries that are richer (on a per-capita 
basis), more free (there is more to freedom than the right to bear arms) 
and certainly more secular than the US, America remains the greatest 
*exporter* of those values that the terrorists so despise. The simple 
existence of such things as freedom and equality is a threat to their 
world-view.
