Hi --

Stemming from an earlier thread I've been trying to sort out my spell Hot
Keys and have been having a very frustrating time too !! It seems that
whatever time I enter into the macro after the pause statement returns a
message during casting of 'You haven't recovered yet' - See below ... (Root
= Slot 1, Flame Burst = Slot 2)

/sit off
/pause 20,/cast 1
/pause 40,/cast 2
/pause 40,/cast 2
/pause 40,/cast 2

This should Root my target, then fire three consecutive offensive spells at
it, however, for me it isn't working. Also, I'd like to know what the
maximum amount of pauses one can have on one line, as well as the maximum
number of spells that can be cast through one Hot Key? .. For example, I
know this doesn't work, but does it not work because it's impossible to do,
or simply because I have made an error in my macro?

/sit off
/pause 20,/cast 2,/pause 20,/cast 2
/pause 20,/cast 2,/pause 20,/cast 2

How does one work out what delay do include in the micro? I've checked my
spellbook and it tells me that Root takes 2 seconds to cast, yet the
duration from start to finish is 4.8 seconds (time obtained from the
strategy guide) so what number do I put after my pause? I am aware that 40
returns a 4 second delay.

Thanks for your time,

Stevie.
