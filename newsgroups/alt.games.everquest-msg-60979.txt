I have a GeForce3 with a 1.8GHz machine and didn't notice any frame rate
differences. Graphics quality was the same except when underwater. With DX7,
the murkiness was modeled quite nicely with a gradual fade to nothingness.
In DX8 there was just an abrupt, black clipping plane. Also, solid objects
underwater (the pillars around the dome in Lake of Ill Omen) tended to pop
in and out abruptly.
