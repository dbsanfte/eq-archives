They all seem ok. I'd not stay away from  any long guild names, they look a
bit ridiculous. ***** of ****** or maybe ****** of the ******  are about as
long as I'd go, the more words a name has the less impact it creates, less
is more.
e.g.

(These are all Guild Names from Bristlebane, afaik there aren't many players
from BB in this NG so I hope I'm not about to offend to anyone...There is a
character called Bizbee but he isn't guilded and I don't actually think it's
the Biz from here)

"Eternal Lords of Norrath"

imo "Eternal Lords" or "Lords of Norrath" sound much better.

"Champions of Norrath and all"

Same reasoning.

Also make sure it's spelt correctly or doesn't come out looking erm...dumb

"Lost Heros" Would be better as "Lost Heroes"

"Nights of the holy light" Now if this is a play on words, like the,
excellent, "Knights of Insomnia" then I don't get it. Of course it may be an
ironic, play on words...but looks more like a spelling mistake. The again
maybe it's a religious reference to the night when (according to Christian
belief) a Star shone brightly in the sky...hmmm if that is the case, I'll
stop smiling at it, if not... :ï¿½)

"Legion of the Chosen Few" Legion meaning Many and few meaning, well, not
many.  So we have a large amount of not much. Sorry I laugh every time I see
this guild tag.

One last thing, check what your name would be as an acronym, Clan of the Roc
become CoR, Ring of Valor becomes RoV all ok there but, Brothers of Blood
become BoB and, the split off of RoV, Clan of War becomes CoW. Just a
thought.

I prefer the first two suggestions over Dragon Walkers, but that's just my
opinion
