Personally i hope the go through with the group buff change. Im getting 
TIRED of being called a liar when i tell a level 16 person in pok that i 
cant pot9 them (believe it or not, happened 8 times so far), i dont even 
bother to explain to them that i havent go the 70K to buy the group pot9 
or the luck with the 1 rune i turned, they just go straigt on ignore now.
