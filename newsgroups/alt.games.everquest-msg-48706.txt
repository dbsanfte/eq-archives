Not sure of answer to your question, but I think they give you the seal
back when you complete the quest IIRC what i read.  I am with you on
upgrading the shawl.  Until 4th shawl minimum i don't see why a
priest/caster class would give up the lizardscale mantle most have.  It
has better stats til 4th shawl+
