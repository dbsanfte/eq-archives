What if instead of using root/atone, I charmed the guard?  What if I
used the exact same technique, only I root/atoned the wolf when the
Coldain ran, and nuked him down instead?  Would that
still be an exploit?  If so, I'm afraid that bards, chanters, and necromancers
should save time and turn in their account keys now.  If not, then why in
Brell's empty beer barrel would using the far clumsier root/atone method
be an exploit?  If anything, its working -too- hard for a kill!  I risk faction
hits,
mass guard aggro, and the all to frequent occurance of the guard KSing
"my" kill from me, should the fleeing mob path back to the rooted guard's
reach. Risk versus reward, Verant should be toasting me with Drum's
champagne out of my dirty Tboots, not coming up with zany "exploit" rules...
but I've never seen any suggestion that there are any, can you point to them?
