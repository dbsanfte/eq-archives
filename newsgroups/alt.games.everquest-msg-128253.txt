    Doubtful. The "destroyer" is the guildleader. He doesn't have alts,
period. If you looked at the gear on his wizard you'd understand why he
couldn't bear to play anything else - you know how some points systems are
slanted to people who always play to a very large degree? Yeah, that's him.
One of the best geared wizards in game, especially amazing considering he
doesn't have the advantage of Seru or VT loot yet. And considering that as
of this weekend, our server has three Tier Seven guilds (Wraith cleared AL
and HP on their first attempts - grats SEQ).

    E-Bay is always a worry - that's how a couple of SoDs got into
circulation. Both Vis and ourselves have a "droppable stuff back to us when
you go plz" policy now for precisely this reason. I imagine it'll eventually
be broken, but you don't leave the front door wide open because the window
is unlocked if you catch my drift.

> Or what if they get some new monk recruits?

    They can earn their loot, the same as everyone else. Remember, this
guild is on strict points. A new recruit would have to pay through the nose,
using points they likely don't have and wouldn't have for some time, to get
those pants. Vis also doesn't reduce the points cost on old stuff, as it's
"unfair to those that paid the old amount" - so it isn't getting any cheaper
to get them.

    The GM can at least say "the following items were transferred to
Quellious", as they check gear when a transfer is done. So if anyone claims
that's how they got something, you can call them on it. Once you trade
something to the general populace, it's lost as far as tracking goes.

    We do. The member in question is a very old member, who has had access
to much more than one gnome mask over his long career. If he wanted to screw
us, he could have done so in many, many more ways that would have been much
more subtle.

    Yes, *wince*.

    No, you didn't go far enough. The actual check is "What
cap/boots/robe" - if the dwarf tells you exactly what you need to hand in,
you're golden. If not, you need more faction. They will tell you that they
make wonderful caps, robes etc. as long as they'll talk to you - they just
won't tell you exactly how.

    What was the old waist haste, RBG/RBB? Should be able to get new haste
no problem by swapping the belt for a cloak then.
