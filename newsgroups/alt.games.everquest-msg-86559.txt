I play both EQ and DAOC... They both have their good and bad points. I think
we all know about EQ so I won't go there. I too grew bored with the game
after playing for a few weeks and turned my attention back to EQ... then I
recently went back to DAOC (within the past 30-40 days) and have played
little EQ since... The game is just much smoother, less bugs and they have
added more zones/dungeons/mob models/spell effects/etc... I am really
impressed with Mythic's commitment to make this the best game out there.
During my second "round" of DAOC play I think I stopped comparing it to EQ
and started to accept it for the game it was and am getting a much better
understanding and appreciation for it... I absolutely love the Infiltrator
class. I think the biggest thing that EQ players miss is the social
interaction with other players... in DAOC there is much less of it until you
build a friend/guild base of players to socialize with. It seemed so freakin
"quiet" to me for a long time. After playing for awhile now, I have begun to
appreciate this silence... no more 13 years olds having public adolescent
displays of ignorance and stupidity to everyone, no more flamers spreading
their negativity to everyone... I am not saying that these things cannot
happen.. they just happen ALOT less in DAOC. If you haven't played it, give
it a try! If you have played it upon it's release and left shortly
thereafter, you might want to give it a second glance...
