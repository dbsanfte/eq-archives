No, they mean for you to take on mobs that provide more challenge than
taking candy from a baby. To go back to what someone else said: ONE AA
POINT PER HOUR SOLO. That is absurdly easy.

High risk with low reward encounters don't break the game. People just
don't bother with those. Low risk with extremely high reward, however,
will have people flocking to take advantage of it, breaking game
balance entirely.

Actually, I do seem to recall them scaling down overpowered mobs
before. In fact, they totally removed one because there was no good
way to "fix" him without making him too easy for what game lore made
appropriate. (Mistmoore, anyone?)
