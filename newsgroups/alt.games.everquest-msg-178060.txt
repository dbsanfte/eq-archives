>    What does Sentinal do?

Sentinal is a very very very annoying spell.  A chanter targets herself, 
casts it, and it creates this "zone" around the spot the chanter was 
standing on.  If anything enters this "zone" the chanter gets a message 
alerting them, and the person who entered the zone gets a message along the 
lines of "You feel something watching you."

Cast this about 20 times in a heavily populated area and you'll spam people 
to death, lag a few out, get a lot of people pissed, and probably get your 
ass petitioned.

Every once in a while, if I see a real newbie, I'll help them if I can ( 
buffs, etc ), then drop a sentinel or 2 near them to freak them out.  When 
they ask me who is watching them, I make up some story to give them a 
little scare, usually involving their diety or the GMs.
