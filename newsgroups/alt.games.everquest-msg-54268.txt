Funny but highly bannable ;)
Doubtless you'd have to do it more than once though.

The problem with your story though is that for some time now you have
to click on a box to confirm that you want to be translocated, and it
says the location. So was the guy dumb enough to click yes when the
box asked him if he wanted to go to skyfire?
