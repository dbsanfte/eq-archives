Yea the pet buff acts as a full heal right now for the Beastlord pet BUT I would not count on it staying that way. Some say it is a
bug and will be caught sooner or later. Till then I use it when my pet gets less than 1/4 health.

Oh and as far as the cloak. Get back to Shadeweavers thicket and do the Blessed Champions Cloak quest. Great cloak that will hold
you for a while and easy to do at your level in about 3 hours. As far as I have seen everyone fails on the first try but succeeds on
the second so get enough hides to do it twice. Good Luck.
