Fuck off. Forever.

I have no patience for laziness, and being a "newbie" doesn't excuse
it. With minimal effort, he could have done just like I did when I was
a newbie and found the website. I have even less patience when said
lazy pricks decide to preach to me about manners (where were theirs
when they expected others to do the work for them?!). If you have a
problem with that, you can shove it up your ass if there's room for it
next to that stick that's already there.
