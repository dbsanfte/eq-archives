I only have the first 1 or 2 of those on my cleric (a wee bit younger
than you!) and have never even memmed 'em.  After 30 levels as a bard,
I've learned a few things about agro and don't think I want my cleric
following *that* trail, thank-you-very-much!  ;-)
That, and my damn root breaks way too quickly.
