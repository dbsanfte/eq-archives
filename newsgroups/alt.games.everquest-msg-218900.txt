I'm afraid when I play my enchanter I wouldn't want a druid as main
healer in the group unless I knew them. There's just too many druids
that view healing as too much bother to risk relying on them for heals.

Plus enchanters usually go into groups expecting to die occasionally,
not having rez for those times is not something they want to deal with.
