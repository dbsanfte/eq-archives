Yep, the prod is turned into a no drop item to let you get into HS,
and since that item is needed one per character, a really active player
can use up to 8 per server, taking them out of the trade pool.

Instead of a couple decent but class limited weapons, the prod
and fang both turn into a space occupier.

If you are of a level to go to HS, then 600pp to not have to go sit
around in LOIO killing greenies isn't a bad deal, either.
