You might seriously want to consider a differant game if you wont be able to
play that often. This game requires a lot of determination and time to advance
in beyond the boring "newbie" levels. Guilds, decent items, and most of all
gaining of levels will start to take more and more time the further you
advance. Just a warning :)
