I've decided I'd like to try being a wizard. People say they can be one of
the best/most fun casters in the game, and seeing they get allot of attack
magic I think I'd like them pretty well (less good warrior that uses magic).
    I'm thinking about starting a Gnome.  For one reason I've never started
a character outside of Antonica other than Iksar, and I doubt they'd make a
good wizard (a good wizard lunch maybe), and then there's the little rule,
"if it aint a lizard, it wants to kill you", and some don't even apply with
that one (bandits, footpads, others).
    According to http://eq.castersrealm.com they have good starting stats.
(rank/total ranking possible)
Gnome (this is putting 25 into INT and 5 into STR which CastersRealm
recommends same on all races).
2/3 highest STR.  65
2/3 highest STA.  80
2/4 highest AGI  85
1/3 highest DEX  85
4/4 highest WIZ  67
3/5 highest INT  133
4/4 highest CHA  60

    Any good tips/suggestions I should know before starting?
