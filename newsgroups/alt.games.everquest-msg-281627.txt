after this last update I haven't been able to complete the patch.  I am on a
dial up connection and about 80% through the download it stopped at a file
EQLS_window_pieces_02.tga.  The next message says the patch server may be
busy to please reattempt the download.

Surely it's not busy for 2 days is it?  Lol

what do you think the problem is?


Thanks
