I will admit to being single mindedly rabid.

about hating nVidia.

<mourn 3dfx>

Yes, I have an ATI. The lesser of two evils imho. And the better of the two
as well, imho.
But there is no reason ANY game shouldn't work reasonably well with either.
If one or the other is having a problem on someone's machine, follow sop.
Reinstall DX9
update/reinstall drivers (another pet peeve: Got a friend plays about 6
games regular like. 2 of them demand, for bug free performance, a certain
version, not the latest, of the nVidia drivers. Which one is he supposed to
use then? Well he used the first one's driver, that lets the second one run,
and just crash every couple of hours, as opposed to the second one's
drivers, that cause the first one to hard freeze on startup. Mind you I
personally hold the game programmers responsable, not nVidia.. well not
much. both games run fine on my non-directx 9 compliant radeon 8500 in my
other computer)
update/reinstall related drivers: motherboard, etc...
look at common problem paths: Example, I have a Via chipset MB. Via SUCKS
ASS. Therefore many of my problems that don't seem to strike the populace at
large I blame on it.
