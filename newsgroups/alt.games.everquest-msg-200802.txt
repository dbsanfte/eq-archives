Why? Just so a bunch of people four levels lower than me can take their

Just because I would have it different doesn't mean I'm wrong, either. 
Majority opinion? Please. How many people do you know that download MP3's

it right or even a good idea.

That should of course be a reward for their higher understanding of game 
mechanics and their roles, not for merely rolling up an brand new 
character. 

You're wanting to level the playing field. That's wrong. Experience and 
knowledge should mean something.
