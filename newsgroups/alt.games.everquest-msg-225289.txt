Read the post.  There's a whole slew of new abilities tied to 'leadership
points.'  Like being able to make one person on the raid the MA,  and
whatever the MA targets is pointed out to the whole raid (probably another
variation on the new Target Dougnut).  Or being able to put a waypoint up
that everyone in the raid can see - "/rsay Get everyone to Water, then move
to the waypoint ASAP for CoH to Coirnav!"
