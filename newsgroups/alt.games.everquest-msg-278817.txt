I don't know why you are replying to my post with your information about RP.
Below is all the information that you snipped from the original message,
where is any reference to RP? Unless you meant RFP, then we agree, he should
have typed out something everyone understood.

The point being is that you were not at all unclear about what I was
communicating. The subject being discussed is obscure made up acronyms that
aren't clearly understood. Comparing well known apostrophe punctuation to
obscure made up acronyms is clearly comparing apples to oranges. But then,
you already knew that.
