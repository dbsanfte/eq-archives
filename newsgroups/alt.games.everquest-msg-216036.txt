I remember getting hit with it while never getting in range.  I thought procs
happened only when a weapon was being swung.  There's some sort of third
option, though, like what happens with Drakes in CS, where they "breathe" at
you without contact and without pausing to cast (nor being interruptable).
Perhaps thats what the specs were doing?  Honestly its been a couple years
since I did anything with them, but I'm almost certain they were lifetapping
me from a distance.
