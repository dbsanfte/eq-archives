Hi!  I'm hoping someone can me help me out here.  I tried the google search
and quest searches on other sites, but couldn't find anything unless I'm
looking wrong.  I have a couple of shackle keys (#22, 20, and 24 I think)
that I got off Orc Slavers in Crushbone last night with my now lvl 12
enchanter - WOOT!! - but I have no idea what to do with them.  Doea anyone
know?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!!  Thanks!!
