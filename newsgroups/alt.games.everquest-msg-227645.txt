People have reported having problems from just deleting the .txc files.  
Better solution is to turn off texture caching, log in, camp to desktop.  
Turn on texture caching, log back in, and play.  That should cause EQ to 
redo the texture files as it needs them.  That being said, when I had the 
problem, I just deleted the .txc files, and had no problems as a result.
