I quit AO after 2 months and part of the reason was how horrible that
engine ran on my system. Luclin runs much better for me. I never got a
chance to see if AO improved much.

This is because EQ is playing catch up. They are trying to make a silk
purse out of a pig, or however that goes. It ends up being harder and
more buggy than just making a fully new game.

Basically. AO is a newer engine and probably has more modular
upgrading ability. Luclin is EQ's first big upgrade and its had to
drag it kicking and screaming into the year 2002.

Your post is a bit like comparing a brand new lexus to a 65 mustang
that your neighbor has and that he dropped a newer engine into. His
mustang might be faster and run better than it did but it won't be a
lexus and it would be easier to build a wholey new lexus than to try
to turn the mustang into one.
