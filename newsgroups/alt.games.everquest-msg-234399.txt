What occured is that i purchased EQ trilogy, got win 98 and dx 8.1 only to
find my computer didnt have enough memory at that time to run it. I could
run the character spin etc but getting on to the world etc it would load and
load black screen and go back into the logon screen. end result being that
my free 30 days was lost. Now i managed to get my parents to get a new
computer so was now able to run it but I need to locate game cards so i can
play. Anyone with a good server to play from oz, *(roleplay not looking for
Pv P), suggestions etc please reply. Cool thanks in advance.
