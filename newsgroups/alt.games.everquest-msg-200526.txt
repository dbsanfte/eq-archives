Ed, this is nothing new.  I cannot recall any time in the last four
years that there has been a shortage of INT casters with non-maxed
Defense skills.  Not to mention Druids and even Clerics (!) who were
geared and played as if they were INT casters.  And they are not at
a "severe" disadvantage at later levels.  Being squished like a bug
slightly more often than a more meticulous player does not fit my
definition of a "severe" disadvantage.  For the INT casters it is a
slight disadvantage, for Druids it's more a matter of limiting their
playstyle a bit.  For a Cleric I'd say it's somewhat important, I've
been in a small raid that wiped because the lead Cleric melted in
seconds when summond by a not too incredibly tough mob.  That said,
I've always worked to max Defense on all of my characters, it's fun
to be a BattleDruid[tm]!
