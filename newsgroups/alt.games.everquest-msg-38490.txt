Isn't supported by numbers. EQ had more subscribers after a year then UO. UO
never lost numbers during that time, it stayed pretty stagnant.

I watched entire guilds breakup and people quit the game. I probably saw
several thousand that were only around for their first free month. The ones
that stayed, like Ronald McDonald or LoD were the cheaters and low lifes
that loved the lack of rule enforcement.

Same old, same old. No reason to leave w/o a significantly better game
available.

Different interpretations of the situation, but botton line conclusion is
probably the same. The don't know how to get the casual gamer involved
because they dispise anyone that isn't willing to play until their fingers
are bleeding and their head caves in. 'You will harvest monsters and like
it!"
