Any challenge comes with stress.  But nobody should be getting
particularly stressed by EQ, it is a video game after all.  If
you want LDoN with minimal stress try to arrange/join groups
that average near, but below, a difficulty breakpoint.  A group
of 6 L53's will get the same adventure as a group of 6 L57's,
guess who'll have an easier time of it.  I mentioned the quick
completion to emphasize that it wasn't a marginal group, most
of my groups take 70 to 80 minutes to finish, we won easily
without taking the "easy out" of a slaughter mission despite
not having a snarer in the group and rarely slowing the mobs.
