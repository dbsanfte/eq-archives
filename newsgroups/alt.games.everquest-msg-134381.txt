}So, went over Remington Stone / Zinphandel Chianti's web page

Yay! Traffic! :)

}OK, on to Enhancement.  Clerics cast a lot of enhancements.
}and spend a lot of mana doing so.  Won't work on DA/DB,
}but other than that seems to be wide open.  Note says won't
}work on Complete Heal spells...which could never be confused
}for buffs.  I bet they mean won't work on Celestial Heal spells.

I'm pretty sure they did mean Cheal.  I copied the info from castersrealm, 
but I have a vague memory of geting confirmation in-game that it worked 
with HoT.  If someone could test it and confirm, though, I'd appreciate 
it.  I'd hate to have misinformation in there. :)  -Why- they specify 
Cheal I'm not sure... think it's just making sure noone has any doubts.
And it may have been easiest to implement as a 'no focus effect wil ever 
work with Cheal' rule, or even 'none but extended range'.

}Hmm, suppose I can put it on during raid buffing or pre exp group starts.

Yes, I think most of the enhancement gear is something I'd carry in my bag 
and swap in at buff time.

}Healing.  Won't work on CHeal, and I think I"ve also heard
}not on Celestial.

I haven't heard that...  If someone could test it and confirm?

}This would mean that its useless for 90% of
}the heals I cast.  Given the Uberness of the mobs that must
}be beat down to get this, I'm thinking thats a lot to ask.

I think the idol of the underking may be easiest to get.  Sliznik was not 
that hard to kill, as I recall.  I wish there was a bestiary page for him, 
but I dunno the relevant stuff to submit in enough detail.

}Mana Preservation III.  Why this one doesn't work on CHeal
}is beyond me.  Blatent anti-clericism is what that is.

Let's just call it 'caster balancing'. :)

}Reagent Conservation III.  This is a joke.  15 % chance of not
}using a peridot?  Bah, who cares.  Lets take a peek though
}just for grins.  Suck bracer.  Suck hat.  Suck neck...  yep,
}VI thinks this focus effect sucks too.

True, but you could swap it in just before a round of aego/symbol.  For 
myself, it may make a difference when I end up chaining runes.  Although 
that's happened um... once so far. :)

}Spell Haste III.  Typo there, says 33 second cast time but it
}means 3 second cast time.  

Ahgrr!  I -swear- I fixed that typo.  Musta forgotten to hit save or 
something.  Thanks for pointing it out. :) Doh, the other typo I fixed 
that day is back too.  Must not have saved.
