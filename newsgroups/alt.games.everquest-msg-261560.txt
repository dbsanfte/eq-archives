I might point to The Gulf of Gunthak, on the left side of the beach for the
undead, or Mistmoore, possibly Kaesora, near the entrance (It has been a
long time since I have been there, so I am not certain of the levels, but
undead it is), perhaps Stonebrunt Mountains or Jagged Pine Forest.

Just a few thoughts...

Good luck.
