Those who dismay and turn into darkness, will not be allowed to return.
Those who persevere will be the first kings and queens of the earth and
shall be blessed richly with the fruit of their offspring. I have seen with
mine own eyes couples walking hand in hand unafraid of the world or those
who inhabit it. That is a miracle in my own eyes which even I am impressed.
Do not be afraid for I am with thee, even if you cannot see me there
watching you.
