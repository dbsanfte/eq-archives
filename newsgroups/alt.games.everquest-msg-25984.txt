Which would be fine, but the true effect is that it causes the vast majority
of players to not take any risks at all.  Everyone seeks out groups where
the risk of dying is low and they camp things they know they can handle.

Players will always seek to minimize the risk of losing xp, and they do a
wonderful job of it.  It also makes for a rather dull situation most of the
time.

I think it's the biggest single problem EQ faces in the long run, risk
avoidance by players that is.
