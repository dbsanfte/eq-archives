No.  Every level is the same rate of required exp.

You make a choice of how your experience is split.  From level 51, you can
assign a percentage of your exp to AA exp.

Yes its possible... wouldn't happen much though.  Would you really want 5
more STR, DEX etc, rather than the ability to rampage, flurry, ae taunt,

If your high enough level to max your AA skills, it stands a good chance
your stats are close to maxed anyway.
