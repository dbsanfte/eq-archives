No, because there is no reason to fix that. But the story behind it is
somewhat different from the above explanation. There has been a quite
interesting discussion about the warrior AE group at the steelwarrior
message board. And as far as I understand it it goes like this.
The warrior needs an ae proccing weapon like the earthshaker mentioned
above(Doesn't drop anymore btw). Second the warrior want's to be slowed
as much as possible. 

With this setup someone needs to pull a large crowd of mobs to the
warrior who uses his rampage aa to hit each mob in range with his
attack. While this doesn't seem to do anything special the trick is the
ae proccing earthshaker. Every swing at a mob seems to count
individually. So the chance for the earthcaller to proc increases the
more mobs there are in camp. Given that the warrior is as slow as
possible the earthcaller's procrate per swing is as high as possible. So
it will go off on more then one mob in the crowd. The result is quite
astonishing.

To flesh it a bit out lets assume you pull 30 mobs. If it procs on half
of the mobs it will deal 15x246 damage(3690 points). And this damage is
applied as ae damage so every mob in range will suffer it! I don't know
the hp of PoI mobs but as you can see it's just a matter of how much
mobs you can bring in range.

Btw, the group that started this discussion on steelwarriors were three
warriors with an earthshaker each. And they did NOT survive this as they
were unable to successfully hold each mob in range since the earthquake
effect has a knockback. They just did it for fun and for proof of
concept.
