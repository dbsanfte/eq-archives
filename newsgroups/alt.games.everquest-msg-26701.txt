First off, thanks.  Second, I understand that clerics actually heal 15% more
hp per cast of the same heal spell, I don't actually know the truth of this.
Third, you will get much better healing spells in the long run.  Oh, and you
can't create a human shaman, closest would be a Barbarian Shaman.  On the
nukes the question isn't necessarily how much each one does, but what the
damage to mana ratio is, also, the shaman is quite important in debuffing
and buffing.  The shaman can slow the mobs, and quicken the tanks starting
at level 29, this really helps you the cleric, as the mobs do less damage.
When I am grouping, I rarely use any dd spells, the ones I use the most are
SoW, Quickness(something like that), Tagar's, Malise (For those higher level
and/or resistant mobs), root (depending on the group and situation), and
whatever buffs are appropriate for the situation, and I usually function as
a backup healer.  If I'm with an enchanter, I share the
speeding/slowing/debuffing, and leave the crowd control to the enchanter.
