I am a Kerran Shammy / Provisioner based out of Nettleville. Have been doing 
the writs for Ironforge making various food items.  Realized today that 
everytime I turn in the requested items, my faction goes up with Ironforge 
(obviously), but then it also goes down with four other groups - qeynosian 
guards, concordium, tunarian alliance and some other group - can't remember. 
Anyway, my question is... aren't these factions friendly to the Ironforge? 
Whay would they be mad that I am helping Ironforge?
