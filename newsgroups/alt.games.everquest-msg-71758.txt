Well, the subject says it.  I think that the one mistake about the
Soulbinders is that it does not cost anything, either in time or cash.
There should be ways to suck cash out of the economy.  The system has no way
to remove cash effectively.  I know that part of the vision was for a
player-based economy, but the cash just keeps growing and there is nothing
(except horses and tboots) to pull significant quantites of cash out of the
economy quickly.

Some of the ideas might run to...

Heals from wandering clerics for donations (bigger donations for bigger
heals).  Make it a semi rare spawn and it could wander through relatively
controlled areas.  Add buffs, etc., for donations.

Breeze/Clarity at an enchanters guild ("So you want to see some of our
skills...")

The NPCs already cast many of these spells on other NPCs.  Why not on
players for donations?

Need a SoW?  run to the Shaman or the druids guild and pay for it.

In all cases, you would need high faction (Allied, maybe?) for the buff, but
when strapped for time and no friend around to do it cheap (or free), why
not?

We know why not on vendor weapons and armor, but even those could be brought
more in line to suck some of the excess cash out of the economy.
