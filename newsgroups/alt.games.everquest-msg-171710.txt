This is probably more like a newbie question but here goes.  I have a level
18 Bard that I don't really play that often.  My main is a level 46 cleric,
which is very different than playing a bard.  I find the bard a bit
challenging.  I have mostly soloed the bard.

What I was hoping for is some advice on how to group with a bard.  Is there
a way to target mobs other than clicking on them?  I would hope that if
there were multiple mobs, I could tank one and mezz the other.  Any advice?

Thank you,
