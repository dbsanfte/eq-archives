    My rogue was fairly high level before macros were put in game, so I know
your pain. =) Trust me, macro keys are sooooo much better for this stuff.

    I don't have any.

> And what all do/can you combine?

    You can combine as much as you can pack into the macro. The one my rogue
friend used to use was this:

/attack off
/doability (pick pockets)
/doability (skill he wanted to practice, eg. Sense Traps, Sense Heading,
Beg)
/doability (hide)
/attack on

    Always put the hide last, as failed PP attempts add to hate and you want
to get rid of all of that when you evade.

    Check the Library section of The Safehouse. The first writeup is old,
but the posts after it have the updated information. For example, trying to
fear kite Renux will lead to disaster.

> If I can't kill for it.. do I need a high PP skill to get it?

    200 skill is strongly recommended. Why will become obvious when I
describe what you have to do. You can raise the skill on greens, though, or
during combat with a macro like I described. I also had a specific "Pick
Pockets" macro, with /attack off, pick pockets, /attack on. You just need to
remember to use the skill button and not the macro when in a town, as the
/attack thing doesn't go over well with most locals. You can pick stuff five
levels lower than you or more, and yes it's fun to clean a town's guards as
you wander through.

>  Is it slow to raise?

    I don't remember it being slow to raise, compared with stuff like Pick
Locks, Sense Traps, or Instill Doubt. But I did it from day one.

>   If so.. MQable?  Yes, im very lazy!

    Last I recall, MQable. There's two guildmasters you need to PP, Tani and
Fourny. Tani is in Neriak, the guild hall is fairly far from the zone out
(for if you fail). He undergoes a quick period every so often where he
respawns a bunch of times - that's when you'll likely get the note. Fourny
is near the zone line in Kaladim, but when you aggro him he summons every
other dwarf rogue guildmaster to him. He's a pest because he has a fairly
long respawn period, and he frequently doesn't have the note. Most rogues
will pick him clean, camp to someone else to have fun, then camp back to him
when he's due to repop and try again.

    Some of that you can make up. For example, you missed Terris Thule. But
since your guild didn't kill Bertox before doing Saryn, they weren't able to
do the Tylis side event and will need to go back and do Saryn again before
progressing. Mith Marr is also a bit of a dead-end flag - you don't get
anything for it until much later, when it's time to do Rallos Zek. So plenty
of time to make that up. I was in the same boat as you - I missed the first
two Aerin'Dar raids, so I was a zone or two behind on the HoH path for some
time. Just stick with it, and it'll work itself out.

> Also, Shroud will make a huge difference when I go to a new place to
pull..

    Shroud, if/when you get it, is huge. Our rogues can walk to Plane of
Mischief, to Emperor in Ssra, to Aten in VT, without anything seeing them.
I'd love to get it and become a tourist rogue, but I don't have enough time
in the day for all the things I'd like to do.

    It's about maintaining a lead. Having a lead on other guilds is simply
awesome. You get unlimited attempts on new content, you get to farm stuff
you've figured out at your leisure, it's the best. Right now we have two
guilds trying to do Rallos Zek on our server, to get into the elemental
planes like we are. We've entered into a rotation on attempts, even though
most of the hawks in the guild want RZ killed so the other guilds can't
compete with us in Air, Water, Earth. But I can't think of a person in guild
that doesn't hope they fail for a long time, so we can get what we need out
of those planes and move on before they show up.

    It sure helps that Rallos Zek was recently permakilled because his DoT
is broken! ;-)
