Thanks for all the posts and advice.  

I put out some calls to friends, allies and former guildies that had
gone uber.  Ended up with something like 7 groups... I was stunned and
pleased by the turnout.  Needless to say, it was a non-event.  Ixi
fell twice for myself and another cleric.  Both times with no deaths.
