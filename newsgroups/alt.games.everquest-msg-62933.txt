I've never had a problem with it, except that I don't think a bamboo
flute is a real instrument.  I would use your level 19 invisibility
song, Shauri's Sonorous Clouding, since that requires an instrument.
Go to the nearest bard guild, buy a plain flute, equip it, turn on
SSC, come back many hours later.
