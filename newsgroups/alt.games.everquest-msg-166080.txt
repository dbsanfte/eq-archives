Hi folks, I quaded my wizard up to 43 in the Eastern Wastes but the
Uthorks are starting to turn light blue.  I'm broke from buying SoW
potions and nobody wants to buy my blue diamonds because the market is
saturated in the bazaar.

All this aside, I'm determinded!   All I want to do is hit 44 and have
enough cash to buy my two new DD spells so I can keep up with my
buddies.

I'm looking for suggestions on the best way to complete level 43
quickly as a wizard who usually has to solo due to time constraints.

One last note, travel is no problem, I can usually make enough to keep
buying 10 gulps of SoW at a time, and all suggestions are welcome.

Thanks

Scathan / Tsunamis
