_Had_ been for ages (I made my first skinning knife, in Freeport, about
two years ago).  If the molds are there again now then they've been
returned.  There was a patch some months ago (maybe as long ago as last
autumn) that added a few vendors and changed the inventory of a lot of
vendors in cities all over Norrath, making it much easier to do
many tradeskills.  Unfortunately, when they changed the inventory of
the "Jillian Model" vendors they did not add a vendor anywhere in
Freeport of the type that now carries those molds.  I haven't had cause
to make a knife in quite a while tho, so perhaps they've fixed this
annoyance.
