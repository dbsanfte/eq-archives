That's correct. The conventional wisdom that "it's always the rear-ender's
fault" is a misstatement of actual law on the topic, resulting from the
usual (and quite reasonable) "presumption" in favor of that conclusion.
However, legal presumptions are just that, presumptions, and they can be
overcome with evidence demonstrating a different conclusion. The presumption
of innocence is a very common example. All this means is that unless
otherwise shown, the starting assumption is X. The law quite properly
recognizes that there are always potential exceptions and accommodates this
through the mechanism of presumptions.
