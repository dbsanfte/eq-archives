You're leaving out an important part of the concept - TCC isn't
designed to stop farmers, it's designed to stop inappropriately high
level farmers.

TCC limits farming to groups that can get experience in the combat,
and that therefor are in danger from the combat.

So you agree that if an item is valuable, people will farm it.

You decrease the number of *potential* suppliers. But as you note
above, valuable items will continue to be farmed. The drop rate of an
item isn't altered - a group of six appropriately leveled people will
get just as many drops per time as a singe high level farmer would
have. 

As for the value of items, over time it will drop just as it always
has. Having a high starting value isn't a bad thing.

Standard economic theory has never applied to EQ, and doesn't now. In
EQ, the number of suppliers of looted items has little to do with the
actual supply of those items.
