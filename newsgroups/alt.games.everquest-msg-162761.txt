I did just find the Gold Edition at CompUSA for $69.95US. Not *quite*
as bad, but still more than any other game out there even before you
consider the monthly fee.

Don't get me wrong, the monthly fee is worth every penny (compare to
one dinner/movie evening) for a month's worth of anytime
entertainment. However, $70 is an awful lot to invest just for the
software itself. Maybe I can convince myself it's like paying the
setup fee for cable television or something...
