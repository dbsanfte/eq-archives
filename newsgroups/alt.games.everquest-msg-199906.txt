As far as I know warders like magepets do not equip no drop gear. Something
about npc's destroying any no drop stuff the minute they get it to prevent
MQing it to other chars (give nice no drop stuff to charmed pet, break
charm, kill formor pet, loot the nice no drop stuff with another char).

Exception: last night a cleric friend of mine give his summoned no drop
hammer to a shaman pet and the freaking pet wielded it. Procs were mad
because of the uber shammie buffs on it (FA, Daiku, FoS ~ basically max out
melee stats). I do not know if this was a bug or not but I tested 3
different magepets and they didn't wield the hammer. Didn't get to test a
beastie warder yet.

There is no normal way to get your stuff back which you give your pet, aside
from using exploits to get your pet to go rogue and kill it (not advised).

Another posted something about this. AFAIK the skills were equal in all
melee weapons according to some patch, but SOE/VI has a reputation of
breaking/bugging/no testing things

If you give it a weapon with a base damage over half of the pet's current
damage it's damage will increase (so if it hits max 20, giving it a 11 dam
weapon will give the pet a max of 22 dam thus improving max and overall).
This usually only holds till level 20 or so after which the pet's damage is
too high to keep buying weapons that have that kind of damage.

Pet's delay is fixed. No way to slow it down or speed it up with weapons
(haste items and buffs not counting).

Generally it's more usefull to give pets proccing weapons like Gnoll Hide
Lariats (stun proc), mage summoned petweapons (100+ dd's) and other odd
things you come across (willsapper if you've got cash to spend for instance
:p ).

> d) How do I check on the warder's skills, is there a slash command for
that?

No way to know legally (might be some way via ShowEQ or other programs that
hack into the datastream, but afaik pet's skills are still a mystery).

e) Giving pets armor helps them. They have the same slots like a pc and will
switch beter stuff in if they get it. Mages can summon a full plate set (lvl
49), hp earrings (all levels), hp rings (all levels), proccing weapons (lvl
61+, fists proc from petlvl 10+, swords from petlvl 50+), belt with good
stats and 500 health (lvl 61+) and a 11% haste mask (lvl 56). Bribing a mage
for making a complete outfit for your pet can significantly increase the
worth of your pet.
