What file(s) contained this information... I'd like to see it first
hand. Some of it seems suspect.

Still 4 at level 19, and a whopping 6 at level 43. Don't plan on
having these maxed out by the time your 50 and ready to work AAs.

This in particular seems suspect... are you sure? Where did this info
come from. Ive noticed that if a group member dies during a fight i
often don't get leadership xp, but I though that was because I was now
down to less than 3 players in xp 'range' (ie fewer than 3 players
were going to get xp when it died, and that was too low to earn
leadership xp.)

I haven't noticed losing  leader xp when dying... but i haven't really
looked either.

Note there isn't a Mana Regen one. Just mana enhancement, which if its
anything like the tribute bonuses is pretty worthless.

Still I think many of the abilities  are worth having... inspect buffs
for example, and target targets health. (how does that work? do you
get a new health bar somewhere??)

Nothing is free :)

Does anyone know if group abilities are always 'active' once they're
earned? ie when soloing? when duoing?
