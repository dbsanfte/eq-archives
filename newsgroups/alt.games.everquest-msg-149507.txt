There really is no difference between the two parties.  Or their followers.
They both have followers who just love to call each other names...and the
funniest thing is they BELIEVE it.

Conservatives:  disagree with me and you're a LIBERAL!
Democrats: disagree with me and you're a FASCIST!

Helping people is liberal.  Helping business is fascist.

There was no way I was going to vote for Dubya (what an idiot!  Was before,
is now!!) and decided to vote against Gore as well due to his not giving a
shit about anything but the same thing Dubya is ($$$).  The only difference
is that Gore isn't stupid...but that wasn't enough for me.
