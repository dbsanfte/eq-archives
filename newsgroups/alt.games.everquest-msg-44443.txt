Can't help you on that one. All my druids have leveled in g'fay or l'fay,
even the halfling. I'm not a big fan of the Qeynos side of the world.  FWIW,
I *love* the three spawn bandits in lesser faye at that level (10-14), the
ones near the pixie tower.  Invis to get past the brownies safely, stand on
the hill between the path and the camp, harmony them so you can single pull,
and rake in exp and good loot for the level (bronze weapons, gems, bags).

> 2.  What gear should I be looking for at this lev and the next few levs?

Leather, maybe some split paw stuff, skull of jen'tra, savants cap, anything
with wis or mana on it. Wis will help more later; until you hit about 20
+mana stuff will probably serve you better.

Spell skills you can raise by casting, so don't practice them. The exception
might be summoning when you hit 14. Chances are you haven't used it at all
prior to that point, and Stinging Swarm won't cast worth squat till you
raise it. Points are a quick way to fix that common problem. Melee skills
you won't be using much after 20; again, you can raise them through use,
rather than spending practice points. I'd suggest you just hang on to them
until you identify a specific weakness you need to address.

At 10, I hunt with snare, root, flame lick, ignite, harmony (or panic
animal, depending on what I was hunting), firefist, shield of thistles, and
something else (camo, treeform (for regen effect), gate, depends on what I
think I'm gonna need). At 14, I switch to snare, root, flame lick, stinging
swarm, ignite (or aoe nuke), sow, gate, camo (or whatever).

> 5.  Is my job a healing job  or  a fighting job in a group?

That depends. If there is another healer designated as primary, then you are
a fighter (who needs to remember to save enough mana to backup the healer if
he goes oom - try not to go below 40 just in case you have to take over
healing). If you are the only healer, then that is really all you should
worry about doing unless the fights are just super easy and no one is
getting hurt to speak of.

To Qeynos? Surefall Glade.

Little bit of all three.

No.

Either are good. I like EK myself, but that's just me.

Hmmm, screaming mace is a Crushbone quest and you could get one of those
now. They are 1HB and proc yalup (hp and ac, i think?). You could look into
a combine or velium scimmy if you want to raise 1HS; both will hit magic and
be fairly cheap to purchase.

Good luck!
