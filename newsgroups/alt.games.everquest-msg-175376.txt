Unfortunately, nice and honest people aren't always immediately accretive 
to the bottom line, and with our short-sighted management in today's 
business world, that's all that matters. If being crooks actually made a 
difference a lot of the crappy stores we have today would go out of 
buisiness, but apparently it doesn't matter. Or even, it's what makes a 
buisness a success. Too many sheep customers willing to put up with crooked 
dealings. 

Now as for myself, I shop at Best Buy from time to time. Why? Because they 
may have ass customer service, but if you already know exactly what you 
want, a lot of the times BB has the item at the lowest price[1]. Just don't 
go there expecting their sales people to actually be helpful in any way.

[1] locally. I've found most of my purchases are online nowadays as there's 
plenty of web stores with discount pricing.
