yeah just opened up my friends Christmas present to install it on my comp
before I buy my copy.. *snicker*
was gonna post it had 3 cd's but I see you beat me.. so I'll just tell
everyone about the map! 1 side is the moon, looks kinda neat, has like 8
different sections on it, a forest, mountains, sea, desert, the grey (looks
snowy) Mons Letalis (looks snowy and like an earthquake hit it), thicket,
moor, some more mountains, the kitty city is in the moor... and on the other
side, the olde world
woah and I just realized on the luclin map theres like another picture,
looks like maybe underground tunnels inside the moon? dunno, im sure we'll
know in a month though
