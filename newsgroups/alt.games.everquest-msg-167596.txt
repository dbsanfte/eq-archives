Of course Jazz is grumpy. He's cute when he grumbles. I'm grumpy too, a 
lot of the time. I call my cleric old Grumpy Butt sometimes, cause 
that's how I act when I play him. There's enough flame fests going on 
around here to label all of us as grumpy sometimes. That's why I like 
the label so much. It works for us, and I don't mean any harm in it. May 
as well celebrate one of our persistent traights.
