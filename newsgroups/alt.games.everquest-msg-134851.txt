I'd look at this from another angle -- and one that I tell my own kids on
occasion.  You can think and feel whatever you want and no one can dictate
or mandate your thoughts or feelings or opinions.  Your actions or
behaviors, however, are another matter.  For example you can feel that Joe
is the most irritating person on the planet.  Your opinion can be that the
world would be a better place without Joe around.  Your actions, however,
cannot be to harm Joe in any way. Further, your behavior cannot in any way
differentiate Joe or set Joe up for harm or ridicule from others.  We all
have to live on this planet together. Whatever our thoughts or feelings are,
they are our own.  The best way to facilitate living together, however, is
with a certain code of behaviors and actions.
