eq.crgaming used to be my first stop, but its gone downhill. The 'user 
discussion' was often more useful than raw technical data. (Of course it 
was often just whining about how the spell was useless, or arguing 
because people misinterpreted it, etc... but there were enough diamonds 
in the rough to make it worth scanning.
