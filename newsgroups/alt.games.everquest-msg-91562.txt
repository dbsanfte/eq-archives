Well, likewise. :)
And after following this discussion (thread) for a few days now, and getting
to grips with the fact that The Sleeper is definitely beyond my reach now,
I've more or less come to the conclusion that if anyone is to "blame" (I
don't really blame anyone. I guess it's a logical thing to do, merely
because YOU CAN! :)), it's Verant.
Somehow, it looks like EQ is designed purely and entirely for the "high end"
gamers - people who play 5-7 days a week, at least 5 hours every time - or
gamers, who have been playing EQ since beta.
These guys will always have the advantage over the casual players, thus
somewhat discouraging them from striving for "perfection". Because once they
get there, the "reward" (in this case, The Sleeper) has long since been
grabbed by some uber-players, as described above.
I like to think as myself as somewhere in the middle of the two. I DO play
almost everyday, but often just a quick visit to see if anything exciting is
happening. Weekends I can easily play for 20+ hours, but that's still a
pretty far cry from "high-end", in my book anyway.
Although I agree that the avid players should in some way be "rewarded" more
for their enthusiasm, I still believe Verant is overdoing it a bit.
Finally, I must admit that I have no ultimate solution to this "problem",
but it still leaves me with the feeling that there isn't much room for "the
little guy" in this game... not if he wants to be part of the major events.
(Plane raids, dragon slaying, epics etc. etc.)... too bad, really.

P.S. Just think about it : even when I hit 50+, or even 55+, what chance
would I have of joining an uber-guild on my server? Unless I by some streak
of luck happens to befriend an officer from one such guild...
