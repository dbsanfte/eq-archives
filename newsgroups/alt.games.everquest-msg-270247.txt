In EC or QH, practically never.  In Blackburrow or LGuk (dead side) or 
KC, lots of times; the zones were constructed so you had to get pretty 
deep in before you could get off the tracks.  It varied wildly from zone 
to zone, depending on the architecture.

I liked trains in Paladul, for example, they really livened things up, 
rarely were they an instant slaughter, but they could be a "run to zone" 
or a "dig in boys, the refridgerator is thawing out and its all going to 
spoil".

I'd heard, though, that in EQ2 mobs generally ignore you until they get 
back to their spawn spots, that its relatively hard to be accidentally 
trained (or deliberately trained for that matter) because the mobs 
simply tend to ignore everything around them until they get good and ready!

Yours is the first I've seen to support the idea that this is simply a 
low level mechanic; thats not too shocking given my experience in EQ1, 
where a very frequent battle cry of mine was "Verant trains us wrong!" 
(later changed to SOE trains us wrong); there was a large tendancy for 
things you learned at low levels to be not just less useful, but 
actually contrary to the best course of action at high levels.
