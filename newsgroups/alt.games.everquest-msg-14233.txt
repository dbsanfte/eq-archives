My 6 rogue upgraded from orc pawn cast-offs to a full set (ish) of that
small raw-hide when he cashed in a backpack of belts. Got 2 blue bubbles and
improved his AC by nearly 30 points, plus cash for surplus raw-hide and the
old cloth. Add to that the Kelethin mail quest, the new dagger he bought
with the cash and the opportunity to slaughter some blue Kaladim yard trash,
and he had a great time making that trip.
