They point of this particular discussion is mana dependant classes.
You were trying to make the point that since druids get a pet that
they are not entirely mana dependant.  Taking into consideration that
druids don't get a pet till 55 (brain fart when I said 56), that it's
only level 30 and has crap for hitpoints, it won't live long enough to
keep any kind of mob that a druid could't kill using ES Arms off of
them for any length of time.  It probably won't live long enough for a
druid to get snare off without getting hit.

Let's ignore the fact that the pet seems to be a pain in the ass to
get, unless you want to go kill shit that gives you bad faction with
your own goddess.

Druids are 100% dependant on mana.  I say this as a 55 druid.
