Saw similar myself today.

I ported into WC. Immediately there was someone in my face, with the
name "Public Facility". 

PF: "Hail, can I have a sow?"
ME: "No", and I start running to my destination
PF tells you: "prick"

Hmm. He asked a question, I answered correctly, and I'm a prick?

>What is the appropriate response to this type of request?

Your answer to his request *was* the correct response. Anything he
said after that was irrelevant, and may be readily ignored. He didn't
warrant further attention from you.
