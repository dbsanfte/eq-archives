I wish I could say that.  I hit F8, and sometimes get a target, probably 
less than 50% of the time anymore.  I keep an assist key set up, usually 
with two lines:

/assist puller
/assist ma

for grouping

/assist sa
/assist ma

for raids.

That way, if MA dies, I still target the likely target for slowing.

For multiple mobs, I use the damned mouse for targetting due to the 
extreme unreliability of F8 working at all.

I often am standing on perfectly flat ground, with only one mob in front 
of me, just out of melee range, and F8 will target nothing.  It seriously 
sucks.

I have not seen a pet break mez since they fixed the issues with that 
some time ago.
