I'm fairly confident supercomputer CPUs aren't that much faster than
high-end consumer CPUs that emulating a PC on a supercomputer would
result in something faster than the high-end PC itself.  Emulation of
all that isn't cheap.  And due to the parallelized nature of what
you'd need to emulate, you couldn't very effectively leverage multiple
supercomputer CPUs, either.
