If you are getting the BSOD (blue screen of death) on a regular basis...try
upping the core processor voltage in your bios by +0.1 volt.   Fixes a lot
of issues with 512+ mb ram lock ups as well.

All cpus and memory modules are tested at voltages that far exceed what your
motherboard can deliver during burn-in.  This is done on purpose to initiate
"crib-death" for units that do not meet specifications so @ +0.1 volt you
wont have to worry about frying any components.

This will however generate more heat from the processor and heat kills!
Make sure your processor is adequately cooled with the proper size fan and
that the case is well ventilated.
