I have yet to play a cleric very high (Graham is only 8th level) but from
what I've read on this board, a cleric is expected to reserve ALL mana
for healing spells. She may be allowed to swing a mace from time to time,
but only if she is topped off and everyone is at almost full health. I
should have made that last line read, "try to do anything other than
buff/meditate/heal." Clerics do get some nice abjurations.
