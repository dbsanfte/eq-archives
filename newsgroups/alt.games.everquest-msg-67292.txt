Agreed. The Knights can't dual wield, either and as an SK, I pretty much like
having a high damage per hit 2H, that lets me cast lifetap spells etc in
between without losing a hit etc. However, whent hunting a running mob
(or dueling for that case) I found fast 1H weapons to be better. Those 
situation let you miss the mob easier and wasting a slow 2H hit is
annoying ;)
