Qualified Yes
I don't have to reboot, but I have never successfully just switched back
into EQ, and had everything work properly.  I have tried all the suggestions
I have seen here.  But, I can just kill EQ, and then start it up again
without any problems.  It has been weeks since I have even shut down my
system.

The sound issues seem to have been resolved for me with a MS update to my
onboard sound, but I do not have a decent sound card, no 3D sound and such.
