It equals less full sales, less sales equal less product market and
earning potential which in turn hurts the possibility of future
products. Besides that:

Warez? Anyone.. Anyone? Companies thought that would be a bonus when
they originally went to cdroms and the product got much larger than
the original floppies, people warezed anyway. In the modern broadband
age its nothing but I remember downloading both the UO and EQ betas on
a 28.8 modem overnight for a couple nights and even that was pretty
trivial. They'd lose a lot of sales because friends would burn or
transmit copies then they'd just buy the multi license, everquests
would pop up in warez news groups etc.

Pretty much true. At the station store Kunark is now $14.99 which is
BOTH kunark and old EQ. That makes it pretty cheap when you consider
that when you get a character to 35 (which you don't even know if you
will initially) velious is $14.99 in a mini box now also. Errr wait..
just checked and I guess kunark alone is $14.99 but the Kunark with
old EQ is $19.99. It still makes more sense to buy that at $19.99 than
to buy old eq alone for 10 bucks.. if you know the person will want
kunark soon anyway. Velious for $14.99 can wait a bit thus making more
sense in a way than buying the trilogy all at once.

Exactly and those sales figures make them more money and make them
appear more successful as a company. If verant themselves says, "we
sold 50,000 cd keys!" Its just not going to make a company like Lucas
Arts approach them the way they did with Star Wars Galaxies because
Lucas Arts can look up the hard data from third party orginizations
who report retail sales figures. Luclin was at the top of such retail
figures which is a good reason to still promote the selling of
additional copies in stores instead of with keys. The difference would
literally be hundreds and possibly thousands of fewer retail copies
sold.
