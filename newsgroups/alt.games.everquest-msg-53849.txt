I am seriously impressed... I logged on this morning with my 29 Druid, to
solo some aviaks in SK...  Had one guy ask me to port him, so I did so...
He ended up paying me 25 plat, without me asking for donations...  Another
guy had to go to WC, and he paid me around 23 plat...  So I'm thinking
"Wow!!  I'm getting MONEY!"  Then, had this one Iksar monk ask me to port
him to BB, and that he'd donate...  Sure, why not... I'm on a roll...
Anyway, get to BB, and he asks me to keep him invised, and escort him to
GFay... Sure, I'm not doing anything important at the moment...  And then,
we get to GFay, and he takes off like a bat outta hell... Not donating like
he said he would...  /em grumbles, and self ports back to WC, so I can run
errands in FP...

Anyway, as I run through EC, one necro asks for a sow.. No prob... Sowwed
her, didn't ask for anything, and went on my merry way to EFP...  Got there,
and there was that same necro, asking if I'd be kind enough to port her to
NK, so she can start her Epic... Hey, in that case, Not a prob... Happpy to
help.  And then, she gave me 50 plat!  Woah... :)  /em is a happy little
puppy now.. :)
