Funny you should bring the matter of law and judgement up... I assume you 
are familiar with the term "attenuating circumstances"? A crime that could 
get you twenty years on the electric chair if sober gets you a lot less if 
you are drunk, for example. Now, it can be argued that the system get abused 
a lot, and I agree fully, but it's clear that the law is based on the 
concept that guilt is relative and depends on the circumstances.
