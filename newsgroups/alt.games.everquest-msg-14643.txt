}>}Assuming that the average PC is expected to recognize such things,

}I'm not talking about players... I'm talking about the citizens of

}people wearing this stuff every day.

Hmm, just noticed I said NPC up there where I meant PC.  Your answer 
suggests you read it correctly, though.  

However, as far as I can tell, the only people fitting the description you 
give of the people you are talking about _are_ NPCs.  To date, I have 
never been inspected by one.  So on that much, we agree.

}>}If you don't want people inspecting you, don't wear your nice gear and
}>}they won't.
}>Ahh, a workable, sensible solution, I like it.  Not.  Next you'll tell me 
}>a woman who was raped was probably 'asking for it' because she dressed 
}>provocatively.
}What a brilliant analogy. No, it's like having some punk sticking a
}gun in your face and demanding your Rolex because you chose to wear
}it, it has nothing to do with a brutal attack that stems from mental
}illness... I'd think that you would have seen enough people stick it
}to people comparing stupid shit to rape in this newsgroup to realize
}that wasn't your best choice... as a matter of fact it was probably
}about the stupidest thing you could have said.

I did question the wisdom of using that comment.  I felt it was clear that 
I was comparing the reasonableness of the suggested solutions to the 
problems, rather than the heinousness of the crimes involved, though, so I 
went with it.  

In my mind, suggesting that women should all wear veils to avoid being 
assaulted is unreasonable.  I can think of cultures where that is 
considered reasonable, but personally, I think a civilized society could 
find a better solution...  One that allows a woman freedom of expression 
in her choice of clothing.

Similarly, I think the suggestion that I sit around in non-visible gear to 
avoid being inspected if I don't like it is patently ridiculous.  There is 
simply no reason why a person couldn't ask before doing so, and respect my 
right to privacy if I request that they do so.

}And <why> is this not a solution? If I don't want someone to ask me
}about stuff in real life, I don't flaunt it. Yes, it's a little silly
}in the game, but this is obviously a matter that gets a number of
}people so fucking upset that they're ready to start vomiting over the
}fact that someone was curious what they are wearing. Are you one of
}those guys, who, when a panhandler asks you for cash, you pull that
}wad of hundred dollar bills out of your front pocket with a flourish
}so everyone within 200 feet can see it, then wonder why the panhandler
}kicked you in the balls, took it all, and ran off down the street?
}Sure sounds like it to me.

Let's make a different comparison.  A panhandler asks for cash, you say 
no, I can't spare any, and the panhandler says "But I hear the jingling in 
your pockets!!" Like they're some brilliantly perceptive detective.  This 
has actually happened to me several times.  First off, that jingling is my 
keys, jackass.  Second, the existence of change does not mean I can spare 
it.  Third, none of your fucking business.

Being inspected involuntarily strikes me a lot more like looking to see 
how much change you've got in your pockets.

}Sometimes if you don't like what people have to say, or their actions
}when they are around you, <you> have to take the initiative to avoid
}what you don't like, if it bothers you that much.

Take the initiative, like by saying 'please don't inspect me without 
asking' when I see the message flash through my window, for example?  
Funy, that's about exactly what I do.

}It's a fucking <game>.

Yes, it is.  Games have rules.  Games also have customs.  Not violating 
the rules and customs of the game makes the game more enjoyable for all 
the players.  When playing chess, it is customary not to critique your 
opponent's choice of moves.  There are exceptions... If I'm playing a 
superior opponent, I might even ask for such critique.  And then Kerry 
will say "Oh, it's the hippopotamus opening, fried liver variation." (The 
really scary part is that I didn't make that one up...)  But in general, 
there's a large number of things that don't really affect the game but are 
not acceptable by custom.  Say... distracting your opponent by throwing 
spitwads at him.  In general, if I was playing a game with someone who 
consistently violated what I considered to be the reasonable customs of 
the game, even after I explained that it bothered me, I wouldn't play with 
them anymore.

But then, that's why dad doesn't play chess with me anymore.  Apparently, 
his view of game customs involved winning occasionally. :)

Everquest is not like other games, though.  There isn't just an opponent, 
there's a crowd of 2000 people hanging out on this server.  Just because 
one screwball pisses me off, I'm not going to quit the game.  I'll perhaps 
try to educate them about what exacly they're doing that pisses me off, 
and failing to make headway with that, I may put them on /ignore.  But I 
can't remember the last time I've had to resort to such brutish methods... 
Usually, they say, "oh, sorry" and we both get on with life.

}>}By the way, I always ask first... and I've never been told "no,"
}>}however if I <was>, it sure as hell wouldn't stop me from looking
}>}anyway.
}>It would stop me.  But as long as one asks, I have no problem with it.
}I would consider it extremely rude for someone to respond to my polite
}request by saying "no." That's just me, and I'd figure out pretty
}quickly that this is simply an asshole that needs a lesson in manners,
}or payment in kind. 

Wow, another opening for a comparison involving rape...  "But your honor, 
I felt it was extremely rude of her to tell me 'no'.  She needed a lesson 
in manners."

}You don't always get what you want. It's in the
}game, and that's the way it goes... if you turn off the message, you
}never even know unless the person speaks to you. But then there's
}people who get all bent out of shape because of that, too.

No, you don't always get what you want.  But if my request is reasonable, 
isn't it common decency to respect it?
