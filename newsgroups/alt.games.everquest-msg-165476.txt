In this thread I've seen a lot of, "a casual gamer can't get things
that require a long camp".

I find that funny.  When I've done long camps, it's precisely
*because* they're the activity in EQ that's most suited for
casual play.

Most things, like exp groups, big raids, tradeskilling, etc.,
require a great deal of time "at the keyboard", much of it
non-stop.

Long camps, on the other hand, are ideally suited for being
afk a lot.  Kill PH, go take care of RL stuff.  When it's
time for the PH again, step back to the keyboard for 60 seconds,
then go back to RL stuff.  Rinse, repeat.

I got my Fishbone Earring from the uber-long Hadden camp
because I was swamped with work that week, and a once-every-five-hour
spawn with a rare drop was exactly what would fit into my schedule
without putting much of a dent into my work.

And *because* I was working, I wasn't sitting there for 4+ hours
at a stretch bitching about nothing happening in the game.
I'd have gone insane if I'd tried that camp when I had lots
of time to sit and play.  If I actually have time to play, I'd
rather do something more exciting in the game.

Long camps are *perfect* for the players who don't have
huge amounts of time available.

And even if you can't leave your character afk at the camp
to hold it, you can still get good results by just popping
in when you can and hoping for a lucky break.  I've gotten
the Ancient Cyclops this way, among other "long rare spawns".
