Hello,
      I'm looking for details of the Tunare only Paladin sword Natures
Defender. I know that it requires a Skull from the Corrupter of Life
in Hate, and the skins from three corrupted animals faun, panther and
unicorn in WL. You turn all this in somewhere in the Plane of Growth.
The exact sequence and who to talk to seem to elude me. There was also
once BB where someone said this quest was currently broken. (Hoping
not as Tunare Paladin part way through 54). Any information on this or
links to a good site that explains it would be appreciated.

Ken
