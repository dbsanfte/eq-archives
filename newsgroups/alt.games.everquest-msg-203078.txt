Oh, you're being too literal. :p  Just 'cause you learn something in 5th
grade doesn't mean you're going to need to actually USE it for another 10-20
years. <g>

Actually yes, the math was easy...the explanation of the columns was
confusing to me...and when you start tossing numbers-geek-like column
headers you're guaranteed to get my eyes to glazing before I even get to the
second row. <g>  (no offense to the poster, there are many numbers-geeks in
AGE, I just don't happen to be one of them)
