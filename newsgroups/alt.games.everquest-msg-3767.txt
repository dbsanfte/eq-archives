You pay a monthly fee to use the game world. Sony provides servers (a
lot) and staff to make EQ be a never-ending story, and this has to be
paid for. Unlike any other game you previously bought, things actually
have a life of their own and they change in EQ. You might walk in your
home town and notice that a new shop is there, or more guards are
around. You may come up on the shores of Lake of Ill Omen to see the
sky turn blood red and tons of Gobelins rush out of the water... you
may meet non-players characters that will tell you new tales, give you
hints to things that were not here previously. All this content is
always updated. This is a live word, and not a static one as you're
used to with CD games.
I understand the idea to pay to play might be disturbing when you're
not used to it. But believe me, those $10 a month will actually save
you a lot of money. I never bought a game or a CD-R since I got EQ.
and heck, really, what is $10 a month ? A couple beers maybe... I'd
rather play EQ.
