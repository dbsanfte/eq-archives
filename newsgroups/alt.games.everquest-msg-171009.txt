Hmm, well I certainly don't have access to the developers' thought processes
on that, but I can propose some guesses and see what people think.

1) Simple oversight.  Noone has ever complained about this, and... well the
designers have a poor record of paying attention to details.

2) There were originally very few group spells in the game, and there were few
people at the high end of the games using pets in groups at all due to the
obscene aggro and mez issues that were once in place.  The combination of pet
and group spell is relatively new.

3) The principle group buffer is a bard.  Screwing with bards scares
developers whiter than a milkelf.

4) Some group buffs are already pretty powerful in terms of effect per mana
spent.  Multiply that effectiveness by two for a 6 pet class group?  Might be
a bit much

5) Some of the best pets are charmed MOBs.  You might not WANT to buff a mob
up, though, in some cases.

5b) buffing charmed mobs makes them even better pets... making this easy and
cheap seems like overkill

5c) Allow bard charmed pets to be bard buffed and every other class would be
left in the dust.  At least currently enchanters and druids have some hope of
competing for the "most powerful class" title.
