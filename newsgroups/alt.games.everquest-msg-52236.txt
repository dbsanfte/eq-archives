Furor jabs aside, I don't see how they can put in "epic armor" quests
without totally screwing up the game balance.

We already have items which can take a warrior past 1800(!) AC and
about 7000hps.

What would the epic armor add to this?  10,000hps warriors with
2000AC?

What kind of melee output should we expect to see from mobs given this
then?  Quad 2000 + chain flurry?

We're already reaching the point where mobs have become absurd, with
this line of upgrades, we're gonna pole vault past absurd and land
right dab smack in the middle of fucking stupid.
