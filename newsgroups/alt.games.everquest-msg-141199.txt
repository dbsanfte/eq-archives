Grizzly Bear Skins still drop.  My newly minted mage got one in
East Commonlands this past Friday.

As far as quests go, I had a halfling a couple of months ago who
needed a pair of Grizzly Bear Skins to complete one of his newbie
armor quests.  But I could only find Thick Grizzly Bear Skins and
decided to give those a try.  The combine worked and I got the
armor piece.  So perhaps the two skins are interchangeable.
