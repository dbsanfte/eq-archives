I've been in two groups where *NBG* became subjective where augments were
concerned.  One was a +5 Intelligence augment that a ranger insisted on
rollling on.  He said he *needed* intelligence for his tradeskilling.  He
actually won that roll.  My main is a ranger.  I was embarassed for my whole
class that day.
The other was a warrior who insisted he roll on a wisdom augment, using the
same argument.  In both cases the player *insisted* he was using *NBG*. 
Whatever.
