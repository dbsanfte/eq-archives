And with that, I agree, when I root and rot, I feel like I am accomplishing
more with my time.  I have not ever actually measured the time it takes me
to kill any one given mob using either method, so I don't really know which
is more time efficient, or mana efficient.  I don't play a druid, but, I
imagine that when I am soloing with my shaman, it is very similar, at least
until such time as a druid is at a level to quad kite.
