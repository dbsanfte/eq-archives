Heh. I picked a little bit at the old Veeshan's Peak quest.  I'm just
dreading having to max out another dragon faction aside from CoV on my Half
Elf rogue. :(

Xygoz scowls at you, ready to attack. What would you like your tombstone to
say?

You say, in Elder Dragon, 'Hail, Xygoz'
Xygoz begins to cast a spell.
You are in a cloud of silence.
Xygoz makes a chew toy out of YOU for 600 points.
Xygoz pummels YOU for 600 points.
Xygoz pops YOU on the head for 600 points.
YOU pierce Xygoz for 1 points.
YOU are tormented.
YOU see the guy from MK3 appear at the courner of your vision.
MK3 Guy Says, 'Toasty!'
Xygoz hits YOU for 600 points.
You start sneaking.
You start hiding.
Your attempt to duck out of combat has failed.
Xygoz hits YOU for 600 points.
You have moved, and are no longer hidden!!
Druushk mosies over, and hits YOU for 600 points.
LOADING, Please Wait...
You have entered Plane of Knowledge.
You are out of food.
You are out of drink.
You feel pretty stupid, wondering why you went in solo.
/ooc Donating for a necro summon/rez in Veeshan's Peak...
Iksars, Erudites, gnomes, humans, and dark elves all mock you as they pass.
Bonehead Bigtail says, in Lizardman, 'Silly warmblood.'
Tomb Raider says, in Erudian, 'Can I use my Wake the Dead AA ability on your
corpse so I can solo the dragon that killed you?'
Wee Deadly says, in Gnomish, 'Guess they're using those shiny daggers of
yours for toothpicks now, eh?'
Purple People`Eater says, in Dark Elvish, 'Ha. Bloody Ayr'Dal.'
