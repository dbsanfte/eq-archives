I've found this doesn't work, I have to wait maybe half a second after
the mana bar has moved or often when I stand and canni I don't get any
more mana (i.e. the mana bar is still as opposed to moving the 1-2% it
normally does).  Presumably the client is trying to predict when the
tick is happening but gets it slightly wrong.

And this is on Venril Sathir to which I have ~100ms latencies, so it's
not like I'm horribly lagged.
