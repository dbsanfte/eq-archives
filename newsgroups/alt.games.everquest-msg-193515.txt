So as you may know, bards mana regen sucks.  Really really
badly.  Meditation skill capped at one, and not affected by their
own mana song, by clarity/KEI, by mod rod, by necro mana feed...
sitting down seems to be about all you can do and even that is
the difference between glacial and... glacial.

Two rumors I've heard; one is that Flowing Thought items work on
bards, another is that the AA for mana regen (mental clarity?)
works.

If true, either of these would have an effect on bards dozens of
times greater than it would on high level mana users of other
classes, since it would mean doubling, tripling the mana regen
rate even to get FT 1 or 2!

On the other hand, I have no AA at all, which means MC is at
least 7 or 8 AA away.  And the simplest FT item to get, a
solstice earring, will chew up 5Kpp or so in cash that could be
spent on some nice gear upgrades instead....

So I'm wondering if anyone has actually tested this for bards
