You're talking about intent. Intent is different from motive. 
Accidentally killing someone (without intent) is manslaughter. Killing 
someone on purpose (with intent) is murder. Killing someone with intent 
and a motive of hate towards the victim (as opposed to a motive of 
greed, power or simply a total disrespect for human life for example) is 
now a hate crime and warrants a harsher punishment.

Its not the motive which should be on trial. Motive can help prove 
intent, but the punishment should not be judged on motive. My view is 
that there must be a certain amount of hate already to kill someone with 
intent. Why should it be a different crime if this particular form of 
hatred is not popular at the time? There should be no difference in 
punishment for someone who kills someone else because he wants to rob 
them or because he hates their taste in clothes.
