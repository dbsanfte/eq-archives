Two definitions.
1. For pickup grooups, the ass that loots everything before the corpse
cools, with giving no one else in the group a chance to loot, comment on the
loot, ask for pieces they may need, and usually without autosplit on.
2. For a large raid that needs several groups of people, like the dragon
Nagafen, the ass that loots a piece off the corpse before the loot has been
decided on, and gets the heck out of there and camps. Usually making it very
hard to track down.

The first usually has trouble getting into grooups after his reputation
spreads. The second usually gets banned from raids, and if a GM is thorough,
will have the item removed from them, and their account gets banned.
