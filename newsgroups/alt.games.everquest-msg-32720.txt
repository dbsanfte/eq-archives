I was told by a wizard that I should try fighting the sisters on a certain
island in OOT to sell their belts as a way to earn pp for armor. He also
said that this would mess up some factions, but also said that he hasn't run
into the races it messes up.  Is this a good suggestion?  What factions do
get screwed, and do they really matter (like orcs, goblins, lizardmen,
frogloks, and others which are mobs only)?  Also is it safe for a LV17
Warrior (about to hit 18) to be hanging around in that area alone (solo most
likely)? I'll probably be bound to Freeport.
