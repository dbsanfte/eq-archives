I have not tried this. I really want to experience all features to
their fullest, and I am willing to throw more money at it if
necessary. Maybe 1GB of RAM would help. Do you think the swap file
size is set appropriately?

I think that maybe it does, although I don't remember exactly. I do
know that the game shuts down a bit sluggishly.

Luckily I'm in a position where I can get what is necessary to make it
work properly. I just need to know what that is.

Thanks.
