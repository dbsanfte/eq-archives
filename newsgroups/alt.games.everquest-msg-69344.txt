Since I lost my corpse and the nice boys at verant said "Hahaha fool" I
gotta start over. I had a full set of bronze but that's heavy stuff and even
a warrior has weight limited. I can hold about 123 stones right now...a bit
more when I find someone selling a second orc fang earring. I'm in Runnyeye
now...hoping to get a nice BABS to replace my Axe of Frost...and a few more
to sell.

I see the Goblins and Pickclaws drop Blackened Alloy and blackened Iron
armour. is this better than bronze? compared on value in pp, AC, weight and
anything else. I'm a poor warrior...spent 400pp on buying new items after my
death :(

Outta interest where does bronze armour come from? Is it looted, bought or
made and where??

TIA
