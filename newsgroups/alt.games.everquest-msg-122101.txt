That's wierd, I was getting bored while running around EW killing rhinos for
my rough silver chain, and there ended up being a bunch of them, and the
tundra kodiaks that I was killing for HQ pelts for a friends coldain ring, I
grabbed up 4 kodiaks and 4 rhinos (rhinos still blue at 52!), they never
split up, even at low health, well, the kodiaks did, which was annoying
since they would break away when the rhinos were around half health, but the
rhinos stayed with each other.
