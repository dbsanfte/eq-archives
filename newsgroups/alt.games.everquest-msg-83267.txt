Rogue epic has a single pixel running up and down the blade.

It IS an animation, but rogues  were asked whether they wanted
a BIG FLASHY animation or a small, stealthy one.  The majority
(at the time) voted for small and steathy.  Who wants to sneak
through Sebilis with a neon blade?

Non-epics off the top of my head with animations:

Smoldering Brand.
Smoldering Brand.

I think there are others.
