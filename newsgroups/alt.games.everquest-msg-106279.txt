The first time my druid and wife's necro hunted sarnaks in
the Overthere, the second mob we killed (an enthusiast)
dropped the earring. Had we not been alone in the zone,
we would have shouted for someone to come get it. It's
still rotting in my druid's bank space. Damn NO DROP flag.

I've never seen another one, with that or any other character,
and all total I've spent a lot of time killing sarnaks.
