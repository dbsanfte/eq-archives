All the Crazy Cleric gear is found in the Plane Of Mischief. Given how
hard it is to GET to Plane Of Mischief it's unlikely you will ever see
any. PoM quests are notoriously hard and long winded. The reports I
have had make Plane Of Sky quests positively interesting The gear sure
is worth it tho.. 

Sorry to disappoint you :(
