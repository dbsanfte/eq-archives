I was level 3 when my BF started the game.  My ranger was born in Surefall, his
wizard in Erudin, but we both lived in Qeynos after some kind *little person*
helped us find each other there and "bound us".  We never ventured far from
home.   
One night we were happily minding our own business killing bats in the Qeynos
hills when these magnificantly dressed strangers came running by... VERY FAST. 
Suddenly they stopped.  One in a fancy robe walked back and said something to
my roommate.  It was "hit trade".  Then they took off running again, out into
the dark wilderness.  We never saw them again.  Didn't even have a chance to
say thanks.  Didn't even understand what had happened really.  Suddenly my BF
realized he had this beautiful ROBE in his inventory: A Crystal Covered Shroud!
 And some sort of staff: A Runed Totem Staff!!  And it was *gasp*... MAGIC!  We
were so excited!!!
He used that equipment for many levels.  The shroud is now on one of his
"kids".  No one uses the totem staff anymore, it just sits in his bank account,
taking up space we could realllly use.  
And he says he's not sentimental.... bah!
