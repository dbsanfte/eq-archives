What was the thinking here?

Level up to 8, lose your body, so you ... delete?

The body represented two things, the 15pp or so plus tattered armor you 
lost, and the roughly 10 minutes worth of killing it would take to 
replace the tiny exp loss you suffered.

Deleting, on the other hand, represented 10+ hours of leveling up -plus- 
the same 15pp in cash plus misc gear value.

I was playing a character a couple years ago who was around 15th level 
when he lost all his gear in a glitch (body decayed during a patch). 
GM's offered me a replacement kit of no drop gear the rough equivalent 
of banded, which I turned down, just went out and replaced my stuff 
myself more or less, no big deal.  Certainly it would have been a bigger 
deal to also have to start over from level one.

Having just spent several days playing around on Discord, I'm pretty 
sure I remember just what its like to wipe back down to zero exp... 
sucks, even if you can keep the gear you've accumulated.

Splendid
