Yes

The only time pets become a problem is if you are in a zone (usually a
dungeon) where pathing problems cause the pet to get lost or start
trains. Enchanter pets are a bit tricky becuase you have to get hit at
least once before they will defend you or help with the current
target. You also cannot stop them once they start attacking. This can
cause them to get in the way when trying to mez.

>In addition, how is xp awarded when a charmed pet is used?

EXP works the same with a charmed pet as with a summoned one. The
advantage to using a charmed pet is that you have much more control
over it versus your animation. The disadvantage is that charm wears
off :-P.
