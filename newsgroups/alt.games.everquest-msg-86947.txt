Argh, and I had even re-read that guide just a few days ago.
On the other hand, the guide doesn't specifically mention Kunark
(or "pre-Kunark"), you have to read between the lines to note
that the guide only mentions pre-Kunark dungeons, and/or know
by heart the EQ and Kunark release dates (since the guide's 
clearest indication of its timeframe is where it speaks 
of "almost one year after the public release of Everquest").

But yes, I recalled incorrectly, Kedge was in the game prior
to Kunark.

I can't find exactly *when* Kedge was made available, however.
The closest I've come up with is a Gamespot article which
says:

     About ten months or so after the game's release,
     overcrowding became one of the biggest gameplay issues. 
     Verant addressed this issue by opening up new areas in 
     the game, such as the underwater dungeon of Kedge Keep;
(http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/features/0,12059,2655176-2,00.html)

I've unearthed newsgroup articles speculating about
Kedge's contents as early as May 1999, but apparently the
zone was pretty much unplayable due to insane pathing,
mob poofing, PC's getting stuck, and so on until 10/14/99,
when a system-wide message announced that Kedge had been
changed and asking high-level players to test it and
give feedback.
(http://groups.google.com/groups?q=kedge+itemized&hl=en&selm=7u85ir%246bu%241%40nnrp1.deja.com&rnum=7)

Even Brad McQuaid admitted that the zone was not
exactly "viable" on 9/1/1999:
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=37CCBECE.FC5BE40F%40verant.com&output=gplain

And newsgroup posts around that time declared it "just
plain broken":
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=36431.1597191792DCvioletturkeys%40208.11.224.91&output=gplain

Furthermore, Kedge was not "itemized" (e.g., didn't drop
anything but coins and level-appropriate gems) until sometime
around November 1999 -- I've found October 1999 posts stating
that it wasn't itemized, and December 1999 posts saying that
it was, but can't pin down the exact date it became so.

I first got Everquest a bit after Kunark was released,
and at that time Kedge was being discussed as if it were
a new place to hunt (which in a sense it still was), thus 
the reason for my misrecollection.
