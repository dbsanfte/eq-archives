Ah the suicide stick. =)

That staff is awesome you just have to be careful with it.

Fight Large creatures. You can stand at the very edge of melee
range fighting Large creatures and you will not get hit by the rain.
Great things to fight are mammoths, rhinos and giants in East Wastes.
Wurms in Burning woods and skyfire mtns.

Works great if you have an AE spell party. Critters can go down fast and
in large numbers. =)
