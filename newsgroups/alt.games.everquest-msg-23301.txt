Two things here. Firstly the NAME of a machine tells you nothing about it's
location. hosta.eq.com could be in the US and hostb.eq.com could be in
Russia if they wished. Secondly, Verant has TWO datacentres not one, I do
not know the split, but it is entirely possible that you could reach Brell
and not Prexus, and for it NOT to be Verant's network or machines at fault.
The paths to the datacentre are completely different once you hit the US
backbones.
