I'd say it depends on the spawn rate and the killing rate.  If a group can
clear an area and hold it against respawns and wanderers, engaging every
respawn in a time that is less than the spawn time, so that any other group
killing in that area would slow the first group down, then I'd say it is a
camp.

If a group is leaving some mobs up long enough that someone else could kill
them, and they would be respawned before the first group is ready to fight
them, then it is not a camp, even if it is a single mob static spawn point.
For example, if someone was "camping" Gornit in OOT, and it was taking them
15 minutes after a kill to be ready and attack the next spawn, I'd not
consider them to have the camp, because he is a 6 minute spawn.  I'd insist
that they alternate with me, since after the kill him and he respawns, I can
kill him and he'll respawn again before they are ready.
