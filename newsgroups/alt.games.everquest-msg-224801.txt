This is way OT, but I have had the pleasure recently
of making the acquaintance and becoming friends with
a very sweet gentlemen who, when 17yo, was drafted
into the German army during WWII and becoming a panzer
soldier who was then sent to the Russian front. Yep,
that one. The conversations we have had while, not
surprising to me, being a former military member my-
self, confirmed a lot of what I had assumed. In a
nutshell? 'I was a 17yo farm boy who could barely
read who was told that other countries wanted to de-
stroy mine.'

(And even more OT, living in Hawaii *really* lets
you meet and interact with a whole slewful of folks,
people who make all of that boring history you learned
in high school come to life. If I hadn't moved here, I
definitely wouldn't have met a person who was intimately
involved in WWII from 'that side' or a person whose very
existence came about because of the French occupation of
Vietnam or...Well, you get the picture.)
