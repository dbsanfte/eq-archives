Sorry, gotta disagree.

First off, while "the wharf rat" did indeed ask about soloing, I
replied to the poster who stated "There is little or no strategy
involved to playing a druid."

Second, I do in fact solo my Druid.  That I do so with the express
intent of making him more effective in a group does not in any way
transform my solo play into non-solo play.  And there is definite
strategy to my approach to soloing, which has a substantial effect
on the tactics I employ.  I spend little time practicing not being
hit, as do that quite well already.  Instead I work on Defense
skill-ups and mob positioning, which are things you don't want to
be working on in a dungeon when the Shaman is having a hard time
slowing the mobs and the under-leveled Cleric can't contribute
anything beyond heals and buffs.  And they are not things you will
gain skill at using the "richard cortese" "run away far enough to
cast damage spells" method of soloing.

Just because some people play Druids as solo-only ersatz robe
casters does not mean that that is the only relevant view of
Druid solo play.
