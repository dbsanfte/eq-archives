Yeah, but depending on your race, you may or may not be able to use it.  As
a barbarian, I cannot squeeze through it, unless I shrink with a potion, or
get wolfform cast on me.  The crack is just above the "door" on the right
side, it's fairly big, and the less large races can squeeze through,
sometimes having to duck and stand a lot to make it through.  I have heard
that dwarves have a tough time with it in addition to the large races.
