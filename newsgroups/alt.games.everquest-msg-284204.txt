Which site informs me whether the servers are up and available?

You are the only person who brought up them having to contact the
players.  I only commented that he has a point--that it would be nice
if they did have a site that informs you when the servers are actually
open for people to connect.  The current status page is indeed mostly

I don't recall threatening to cancel my account or sue the company or
some such nonsense.  I think it is a minor issue, in fact.  All of the
drama belongs to you.
