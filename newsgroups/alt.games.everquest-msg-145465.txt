Turn AA to 100%.  Get run 1.  Turn AA back to 0%, resume leveling.
Like almost every other class, Run 1 is incredibly handy, and no other
AA is better than leveling up.

For a puller class, Run 3 might be worth getting.

For a druid who ardently refuses to ever go indoors until they reach
60, Run 1 might not be worth getting either.

Run 1 is "faster than mob" speed, and works when your SOW fades,
is dispelled, or indoors where you can't cast it at all.  You will always
be faster than most mobs as long as you are still moderately healthy
and unencumbered.

As far as the remaining 5 points of general AA, I'd say run 2, run 3,
and blow the rest on anything you like, none of which are at all
important proportional to the effort needed to get them, for most classes.
