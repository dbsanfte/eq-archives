You don't say what level you are, but I'm guessing you're not raiding
post fifty stuff yet. :-P

Low/Mid level "raiding" can be a whole bunch of different things. One of
the things it can *most* often be is a clusterfuck until you learn what
you're doing, but that's why it's so good to start early. Better to
learn it now than later.

No idea why your raid was having some mobs pulled for one group, and
some for others. That's kind of weird. May as well just have three
groups in different areas. We used to do those kinds of raids, and
they're perfectly valid. You take four groups to a zone with several
known camp areas near each other and just set up a few camps. That way,
you can all be in there together, all getting xp and (hopefully) loot.
And if one group get's in trouble there's a dozen or more other guildies
there to help you out.

But later on, you'll be raiding in places where lots of the mobs will be
too big and nasty for one group to take down easily. In cases like that,
you'll have an MA designated (Main Assist). Usually your biggest tank.
He/she will have the responsibility of tagging the mob off the puller
and building up aggro while the healers keep him/her alive. Then, when
aggro is well established, calling in the rest of the raid force to wipe
it out. You can do much bigger mobs, and larger numbers of them, in this
way than you ever could with one group.

You'll also likely have a chanter designated to mez the adds and control
traffic and the order the mobs are killed in. Alternatives to this are
rangers (or other classes) who root park the adds out of the way until
the current mob is finished off. In the case of unmezzable mobs (Kael
giants, for example) you may have a "tank mezzer", who is a backup tank
who will jump on any adds, get their attention, and solo them until the
primary mob is down, usually with a cleric or two keeping the mezzer
alive during this.

Raiding is as different as you want to make it. Just don't go into it
expecting to get any xp. You raid for loot and training primarily. And
for the bragging rights to say you took down <xxx> ubermob that most of
your friends couldn't handle. <g>
