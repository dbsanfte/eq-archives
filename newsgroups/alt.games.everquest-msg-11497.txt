I've had runes of Proximity, Nagafen and Velious drop of critters varying
from level 20 to 28 or so. I know I found them in Najena, Splitpaw and South
Karana at least. Probably got some from Loio, FM and CT as well. They're not
that common and sell for 1 or 2 plat so I just make money off them.

Btw, after searching high and low for Words of Transcendence (for the mage
"stack of water" lvl 24 spell) for weeks, I finally found that I can buy
them in FV at a vendor. 6 plat times 4 tries, but it was damn worth it.

You might check that place as well, I've seen quite a lot of runes and words
at the merchants there and they have an unlimited supply.
