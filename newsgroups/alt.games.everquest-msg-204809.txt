I once was dueling a monk friend with my cleric, amazing what split 0 0 0 4000
can do to a monk.  Course from then on he wouldn't duel me while grouped with me
but thats what a learning curve is like in EQ; in the real world he'd not have
learned a thing, being permanently dead is rather different from merely
respawning naked with no exp lost.
