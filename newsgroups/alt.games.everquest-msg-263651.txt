Another upside to it is that the targeting system is a BIT more intuitive.
So if healing isn't immediately necessary, I can have the mob targetted
for nuking, then when I need to heal the fellow the mob is pummeling on, I
can cast DIRECTLY ON THE MOB, and the heal will actually go to my group
member.  This only works, of course, if the one getting hurt the most is
the one targetted (ie, wouldn't help if the guy being the most beat up is
being pummelled by a mob not my target), but MAN is it especially handy
soloing!  (As a priest.)

A peculiar downside to the current system (and it might only be me) is
that the mages can all replenish power.  Why bad? Well, a lot of folks
signing up to be mage really aren't interested in acting as healers of a
power bar.  Enchanters of yore might be comfortable casting the
power/over/time buff, and necro's of yore might be comfortable casting the
twitch equivalent, but the wizards/magicians of yore having to do
something other than nuke/send in pet? HORRORS!  Already a few times a
mage has gotten edgy with me because their HP got low, I explain to the
group I'm getting low on power, and they don't do an "ohhh! Right! I could
give you power to keep us all healed!".  /sigh

It's going to take some time for them to realize they have to think a
little like priests. And I suspect a lot of them don't like it.  Many are
downright afraid that they'll become the power-b*tches for the group.
Probably the same folks who would gladly say "Heal me bish!".

Oooh, did I just do a proper MMORPG-rant?  Just a little one, I think. ^_^
I'm so rusty.
