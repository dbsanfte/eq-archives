By this he means ratio.

The other thing(especially for a priest or caster) t0o keep in mind is 
procs. Procs get a chance to go off *even if you miss*, so they can be very 
handy.

Another thing is training your skills. Every swing is a chnce at a skillup, 
so you will skill up faster with a fast weapon than a slow one.
