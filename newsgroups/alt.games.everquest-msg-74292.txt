Even if I'm not a dual class, I'm still a hybrid class.  My point is, it's a
pretty trivial task for the class from which my spells are derived.  I'd
figure I'd get it eventually.  If a cleric gets his power from the same
place as I do, then I would figure I could learn a level 12 spell long
before I could learn 90% rez.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
