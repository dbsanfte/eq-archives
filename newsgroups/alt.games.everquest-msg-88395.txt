The game is pretty good about telling me "You do not have consent to
drag this corpse".  Then I have to target it and do the /ttell thing
saying "Consent me." But if it's more than one person, that usually
get's them pushed to the back of the list. And if it takes them too long
(e.g. they've decided to go a.f.k. to make a sandwich while I'm doing
all the work) then I leave their asses there and *they* figure out how
to get it out.

Can you say, "expensive coffin"? I knew you could.
