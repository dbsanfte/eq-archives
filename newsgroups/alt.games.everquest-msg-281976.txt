It's all been said quite nicely. Fact is the test servers don't have the 
users on it that the production servers do. I would imagine its hard to test 
for every event. Also, imagine how big the code is. I sure would not want 
to keep up with it all. I would add, that I think its probably time to 
scrap the code and start a new, yes I tried EQ2 and it was a major
improvement in performance the game runs much smoother than EQ. I would in
a second move to EQ2 if I could take my current toons that I have spent 2
years developing with to EQ2. I feel that a merge of EQ and EQ2 will happen
at some point, so lets bite the bullet and do it now.
Until they merge, if they do. It would be nice if they would take care of
the problems they know about before releasing another expansion, I might be
in the minority on that one tho.

Just my opinion tho.
