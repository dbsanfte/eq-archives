I've never seen one do it either.  They always stop, cast, then
move again.

They also can't start casting on you without line-of-sight,
either (although they can *finish* casting on you even if
you've moved around the corner or run way out of range).
I've used this fact many times in Lower Guk while pulling
the undead wizard frogs -- if I pull them down a long hall
and stand at the end of it, they often chain nuke me from
a distance, but if I duck around a corner, they have
to (and thus do) run all the way down the hall until
they've come enough around my corner and can see me
again before they start casting.  And at that point they're
within melee range, heh heh heh.
