33.

The Priest of Innoruuks Heart is for some new quest,
the spawn has been around for about 1-2 months, and
about the quest, I have no idea, just that there is one,
as Verant confirmed me about that.

I also heared (rumour) that in Freeport there was a similar
spawn, who appeared at about the same time:
same level range, also no faction hit, not wandering,
and also a LORE NO DROP loot of some kind...

Have still not found anyone with input on this, sorry....


Best Regards,
