Each quest piece drops from a "named" mob.  Its name will be a little
different from all the other mobs of the same type around it.  They are
scattered all across Luclin and most of them are wandering mobs and the
majority of them would be impossible to solo for someone level appropriate. 
The quest rewards aren't bad, but are nothing spectacular, particularly with
regards to the effort required to get them.>>

From the reading I was doing at Allakhazam's, it didn't look like most of the
stuff was dropping from named mobs.  It looked like they were coming off normal
tribal gatherers and other common mobs in  DSP.  Is Allakhazams wrong or are
these somewhat common drops?
