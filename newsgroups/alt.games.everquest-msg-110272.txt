Ok...maybe I was just being facetious there ;)

Maybe the things you have mentioned, such as crew, the workings of a ship,
things to do on a boat etc., are what needs to be changed about the boats,
and of course the obvious LD, missing your stop etc technical problems.

Exactly why the boats need to be revised. My point was that I felt they
shouldnt be abolished altogether.

Wheres the fun in a teleport or a horse? Boats are a whole new platform for
encounters, events, quests etc. Why limit the game to just dry-land
adventures. Am I the only one who thinks that sailing out over the horizon
has an element of adventure?
