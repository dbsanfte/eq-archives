Well, EQ2 finally hit the shelves at my local EB Games today, but only in 
the CD version. The DVD version should be available tomorrow, they say. I 
resisted the urge to pick up the CD version just to get it a day earlier, 
but what's up with the difference in ship dates?

Ahh well. I've waited this long. One more day won't kill me.
