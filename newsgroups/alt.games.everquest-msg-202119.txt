Webpages are generally not enough info on a guild. Best way is to ask people
in your group what guild they're in, how thye like it, what they do most of
the time etc.

I'm in an unique guild in that our only restrictions are "speaking dutch"
and "have a main of level 15+". We have about 30 lvl 61+ now and are going
to try Aary (unwritten rule of AB server: whoever kills Aary gets to farm
NToV till Aary pops again) if we can beat other guilds to it. We officially
raid once per week, but the last couple of weeks I find it hard to find days
where I didn't leave an expgroup for some target or another. Not bad for a
guild that has half of it's mains under level 55 and a website that says on
the homepage that lootdistribution of a raid in december is taking place on
the membersforum :P.
