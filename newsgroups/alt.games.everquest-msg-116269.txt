Okie, I have been scanning the news groups for about the past 4 hours.
 I have been looking for that ultimate setup.  LOL...I haven't found
it.  I have seen so much BS I had to go buy a new pair of shoes and
pants cuz I was need deep in it.

OK...Here is the test, list your system stats and anything you think
helps fps, then put down the fps on the 2 tests at the end of this
article.  Here is my newest build (heh, for the wife...she wants all
the bells and whistles).

Power Supply - New EG365P-VE FA (I love it)
M/B - MSI KT3 Ultra ATU - 333 DDR Motherboard
CPU - AMD 1800XP
Video - ATI 8500 64 Meg
Sound - Onboard (not bad either, 5.1 rocks)
RAM - 512 MB OC Systems PC2700 (333 DDR)
HD - 40 GHz IBM 60GXP at ATA100 Defragged Weekly :)
Modem - Cable
That's all that matters :) 

3DMark2002 SE Score - 8445 (for you techies...Ram runs very stable at
2-2-5-2-1t settings)

BIOS - auto, AGP Fast only with 3DMark2002 but EQ crashes with it on,
RAM at 333 FSB 133 X 2 everything else pretty much default.

OK now download Fraps from www.fraps.com (great little fps program
that will ride on top of EQ to show you your Frame Rate)

Now go in and turn every thing on in EQ Video Options, with 1024 X 768
and High quality selected.

Now once all loaded and FPS reading go into Shadowhaven from the
Bazaar, go to the bottom of the first set of stairs and stop.  Scan
back and forth a few times to get everything loaded then just face the
stairs...What is your FPS?

Mine is 16

Now run out to the nexus with nobody around look down at the ground
and try to get over a big white stone somewhere where your FPS is
highest...What is your FPS?

Mine is 207

If we can get some HONEST system builds with good FPS in Shadowhaven
it will help all of us chronic upgraders :) I just have a hard time
when people say they went from a 3-5 year old machine to a new one and
stating "GOD THIS NEW SYSTEM ROCKS" then start spouting off all the bs
when in reality...the new system does rock but there is still video
issues in Luclin and Raids.  This thread is to also let people know
that no matter how much money you throw at a new system you will still
not run glass smooth :)  Now lets see some system stats and scores.

Thank you 
Oofda
