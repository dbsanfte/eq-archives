Actually, all you need is to be playing on a Velious-enabled account.
You do not have to have Velious installed.  E.g., I installed Velious
at home, and enabled Velious on my account.  When I then went to work,
and logged in to that account there, I had the Velious interface, even
though Velious had not been installed there.
