For raids that's the best way - trying to target the MA/SA
is a pain.  But for normal grouping I use plain /assist, and
select the groupmember with F#.   That way I can use the assist
key to get from the mob to it's target.  If I have my pet 
tanking an add, or I'm soloing (not often anymore) I use this
to quickly flip back and forth between a mob and my pet.
