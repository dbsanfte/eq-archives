  The only one giving AO raves is PC Gamer, who never really 
disliked the game (apparently, their reviewer drinks 
Clorox and smokes kitten fur). 

  AO still had item dupe bugs, and appears to have an extremely 
bad economy (things are too expensive, duping was rampant). I 
really really wanted to enjoy AO, but the bugs were too much for me, 
and I felt like I wasn't really getting anywhere. The 
scenery was nice, though. 

  While DAOC has its problems, they are trifles when compared to 
AO. The economy is fairly balanced, so far. Progress is kinda 
slow for me (I primarily solo), but that's the nature of the 
solo player. ;) There's always some quest to do, even though the 
FedEx quests of all these games is getting tiresome. 
Content for high-levels is being dealt with, it appears.
