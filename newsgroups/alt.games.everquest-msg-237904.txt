LOL.  Flirting with someone about whom you don't know anything in real life
is disturbing to me, but to each his own.  I had an experience similar to
that myself.

I just cared about her a little too much, that's the simple way to put it.
When she would tell me of her husband, her father, her life, I should have
said, "Yeah, but your inky blue tits are hawt!"

Note that I didn't ask as much as I was TOLD about herself.  I wanted to
make that clear.
