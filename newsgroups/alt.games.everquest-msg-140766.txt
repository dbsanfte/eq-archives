Recently started some new characters to join a friend who has returned to
the game. One is an Iksar so I have been trying to work on some faction in
Qeynos (Probably the easiest of the cities to do this in) Killing Gnolls and
Bandits and doing appropriate hand ins of fangs, moonstones and sashes.
Starting fully KoS with everyone I took some advice and cheated with Wolf
Form, things seemed to be going fine but what I didn't realise is that my
faction in Wolf Form is totally different from my faction out of it. This
does make sense but when I suggested this was the case, to a couple of
people, I was told categorically NO it wasn't.
Case in point, in Wolf Form I am now upto Amiable (from Dubious) to the
Priests of Life and Knights of Thunder...out of it they still Scowl at me (I
have now raised it upto threatening after managing to hand in several
moonstones in my natural state) Capt Tillin views me as Kindly in Wolf Form
but Dubious out of it.

Has this always been the case, that Wolf Form faction is different to
normal?
I'm sure I did some Muffin quest in FP that required Wolf Form for the first
few stacks but after that I had enough faction to do it in normal (dark elf)
state, that wasn't that long ago.
