It seems the last sentence totally shot down the previous one: Finding
one isn't always easy. You CAN prove that there are no termites.

Not at all. Surely you can search Q&As on the web about business law,
which is what contracts fall under. Really, the reference proving my
side would require interpretation and an understanding of what does
and doesn't make something illegal, as there are no laws that say
outright "breaking contracts is illegal". There ARE laws that lay out
punishments for breaking contracts. That in itself means breaking them
is illegal. You provided a rather nice reference of that yourself. If
you can't understand that, then I'm wasting my time.
