I had same problme with Zonealarm, but i solved it by following method:

Close down Zonealarm
Start up EQ as usual
log on to a char
Alt + Tab  to go to Windowed mode
Alt + shift + R to get " arrow" out of EQ
Startup Zonealarm
at this point you will eIther go LD and a zonealarm window will pop up and
you can give EQ permission to use Internet connection, or you get the
Zonealarm window and if you are fast enough to give EQ permission to access
internet, you can avoid going LD
after you have given permission Alt + Enter to get back to EQ fullscreen.
