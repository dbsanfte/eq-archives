Thank you! :)  I'm hoping/assuming the tinting, or lack-there-of, also
applies if you have luclin graphics turned off?  The reason for all of
this is that there is a rare bit of velious graphic that, with this
tinting, I might finally get to see.  

Polished tin mail shirt and boots have this graphic untinted (it's isn't
ry'gorr look, for those who are confused), but the legs and arms I have
only glimpsed under the dark tinting of matchless armor.  I want to
finally see what this stuff looks like, so I can have my character
portrait done in a full set.  Most folks have never seen this armor (there
are some NPCs in PoK that show it, but most are human, and none are female
half elves), so it will make for a distinctive look.

A look I will then proceed to abandon because a polished tin mail shirt
looks kinda like, well, tin-foil, next to a Tae Ew Chain tunic. :P  What
tinting I will do them is unknown, but I'm _pretty_ sure I won't do
green.
