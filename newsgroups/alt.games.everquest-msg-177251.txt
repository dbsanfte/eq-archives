I really wish however that if such a device was needed and considered so
important it shouldnt have been the province purely of an expansion....and
made available to everyone....I felt the same with Luclin, even though I
have it. All it takes is to make the portal room in PoK a seperate zone
and hive it off fom the rest of PoK and content made for the expansion.
