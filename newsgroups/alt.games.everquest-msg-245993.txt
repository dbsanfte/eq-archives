Absorb Pain is a lifesaver, you really want to get it. It's a quick casting,
quick recharging mega-heal that damages you. Think of it as a kind of
Cannibalization that provides HP to your target instead of mana, with all
the attendant risks. Additionally, however, after using it you will NOT be
able to heal yourself by any means, including Inspirations or Healing Aura,
you'll have to wait for a bit (not sure how long, 2 minutes?) before you can
heal yourself again.

But the effect is dramatic and a real life saver. I use it in the following
manner. In my regular play I'll usually wait to let some minor damage accrue
to a few players and hope to top them all of with an economic Healing Aura,
and then do spot Heal Others as needed. If we're in a really thick battle
and someone drops very low, to say orange or red, I'll shoot them a quick
Absorb Pain and watch them nearly top off to full health instantly (well,
instantly after the casting, it's not immediate but it's fairly quick). It's
dramatic and it's lifesaving and it really illustrates the value of having a
dedicated healer around because in those instances they probably would have
died and incurred debt but for your cast.

One thing you should do if you have other healers present is establish and
understanding with them that if they see you casting Absorb Pain, they
should heal you directly while you're recovering. Fortunately, you are able
to be healed by *others* during this cool-down period. I use a /bind macro
that casts the spell and also does a /group message indicating that I'm
Absorbing Pain, kind of like my Shaman's Canni V message.
