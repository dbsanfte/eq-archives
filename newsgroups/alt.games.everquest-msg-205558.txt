It's been my experience that there are very few shaman who recognize that
Slow is their most important spell, bar none.  Because they don't recognize
it, they take forever (over 5 seconds) to get around to slowing anything for
fear of a little beat-down.

Because they don't recognize it, my enchanter often beats a shaman to the
punch and not only mezzes adds but slows before the shaman gets his ass in
gear.

Because they don't recognize it, why bother having that shaman in the group
at all?  Yes, shaman slows are better than enchanter's, but not by much.

So, what does the 2nd shaman do?  Chances are Slow is a good option if the
first shaman doesn't know his job.

But for raid events, sadly there's about as much to do for a shaman as an
enchanter.  Buff, some debuffs, & some pitiful nukes, hoping against hope
that maybe there'll be an add to slow &/or mezz.  Seems like almost nothing
can be stunned anymore (in POP) so that's out too (for enchanters).
