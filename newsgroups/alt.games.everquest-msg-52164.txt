His bare fist and his holding a twig (delay 10) and holding a Stupid Hammer
(delay
150) all have identical delay, 30.  Which is to say he swings once every 3
seconds
regardless of what (if anything) he is holding.

His bare fist max damage varies depending, not on your level, but his; the
level
four pet summon will get you a pet ranging from level 3 to 6, IIRC, as
you level up more and more of your pets will be lower level than yourself.
You
can increase this by killing lower level pets and recasting till you get your
strongest
one... and might want to do so so as to get the higher HP total if nothing
else.

At level 4, the pets you summon will all be massively improved by a rusty
halberd,
which is the highest damage really cheap weapon you can buy, he'll be doing
a high end of 20 damage a pop.... what is that, about four times what he
currently does?
Two hander second, at 18, Rusty Scythe third at 16, I think that bastard sword
you
mention is damage 7, which would mean 14... still an improvement, but if you
have cash and time to shop you'll be better off getting halberds or two
handers.
