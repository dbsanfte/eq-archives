> I would expect lull spells to work. Just get a cleric/chanter/bard

While I think there are some troubles in getting Lull to work due
to mobs aggro range being longer than the sight line, I have to
ask something:

Did you just tell a Paladin to find someone to cast Lull for him,
carefully going so far as to name the -other- three classes that
get Lull?

Next you'll be advising rogues to find bards to detect traps for
them, or perhaps rangers to find druids or bards to track for
them.
