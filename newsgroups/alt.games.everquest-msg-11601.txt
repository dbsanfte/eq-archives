This is not for Runnyeye but another dungeon.  My 28 sk walked into Najena
yesterday and upon entering the first room with the 2 greater skeletons, was
immediatly attacked by a blue con skeleton.  I had never seen him there
before.  I also found another a little further in.  Anyone seen these before
or did they adda  few higher levels to Najena with the last patch?
