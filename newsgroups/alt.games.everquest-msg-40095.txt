If you are talking about the one that Hadden drops, you are way off.  He is
around level 28 and hits like a bastard ( yellow to me at lvl 26 everytime I
saw him ).  Unless you are a good solo class, he's not easy until around 35,
I think, because of his buddy Rephas.

> pyzjin drops the gbs (9 int ) at level 10

*bzzzzzt*  She spawns at level 13-15.  But, the idea is sound - a low-level
Mob dropping a very nice item.  I got two last weekend from her, after
making her spawn about 13 times in around 27 in-game nights ( exact numbers
are at home).  BTW - Varsoon the Undying has one -hell- of an aggro range.
Not as bad as the pirates at Sister Island or those wanker guards in Misty,
but big nonetheless.

If you feel you need a GBS, get a Stein of Mogguk instead.  If you're a
Wizard, doesn't your Wheel Staff give +10 int? Are there no other
class-specific items that provide what the GBS provides?

For the week that I was killing Pyzjn, I saw Hadden die about 8 times.
Everytime but one, it was someone over level 43.  A buddy of mine was going
to attempt to solo him as a Pally at level 31, but while he was running to
Surefall to get arrows, someone ( level 48 ) pulled him.  It didn't bother
me at all that high-levels killed Hadden, as long as they were there first.
If someone had been waiting for him when they showed up and the late-comer
nuked him first, it's just plain rude.

It also doesn't bother me at all that I "camped" Pyzjn for a week.  She was
about 12 levels below me, but she isn't a static spawn and is red to most
people that hunt in that zone.  Whenever someone came to the ruins and asked
"You camping Pyzjn?"  My answer was always "Yeah, but if you see her pop, go
for it, I can't lay claim to someone who spawns in different place at
different times."  I didn't tell them I knew exactly when she might spawn -
that was my advantage I had, but I also didn't tell them to "Go away, I'm
camping Pyzjn!"  I just let then sit in the ruins, while I made her spawn,
and only twice did they get her, because she popped in or near the ruins
those times.  Both times, I congratulated them on the kill and toldthem I
hope they got the GBS, but they didn't =(  I got my 2 GBSs, and as far as I
know, none of them have gotten one, but I wish them luck.
