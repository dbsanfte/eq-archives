I had no issues single pulling othmir (other than the chief needing harmony
obviously) the week before PoP at 57.  I did get one of the named ones from
the SS camp adding once, but that was it.

I haven't been back at all since then though (currently 59) since the exp
sucks at 58+ (they start going light blue), hell, it wasn't that hot at 57
once I got my feet wet in PoD.  Should make 60 this weekend or next.   <3
