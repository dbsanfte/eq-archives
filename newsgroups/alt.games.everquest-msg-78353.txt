Trakanon is like VS... the fight has to end quickly, before people start
getting trak touched, and die from the dot.

His dot is ugly, it cures very easily though.  Bizarely (or annoyingly, i
should say) I've had the highest resists in my group (300 or so) and been
the only one who got dot'd heh.

Because hes only got 32k hp, once engaged he doesn't usually last more then
a minute for us (our best run at him was 4 groups, 0 shaman,s 0 deaths, 1
dead dragon)
