As pointed out already, most classes can take aggro from a Warrior if they
really try. Knights can grab aggro quicker than a Warrior due to their spell
lines.

>Archery means they can pull single mobs at a good distance

Archery means you can pull at a distance, social mobs close (enough) to each
other will still come by the bucket load. Single pulls are the forte's of
Monks SK's and (situation permits) Necro's.

Yep that's about it. Warrior's melee damage output is 4th (Rogue, Monk,
Ranger, Warrior) but no other class can dishout as much damage while having
the mobs undivided attention (at least not after the Monk nerf) because no
other class will stay upright as long.
