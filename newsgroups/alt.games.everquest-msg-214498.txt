I know how *that* feels... trust me, I was a very lonely little Iksar last 
night... though that was more because just about everyone LFG was wayyyy 
above my level. Got lucky this morning, though, and was part of a nice 
little group -- me, a warrior, a shaman, a cleric, and an enchanter (/wave 
Kreskin), and we did much slaughtering, yea verily.

I have one whole adventure point.  *sniff*  I feel so proud!  I will love 
it and hug it and feed it cheerios.

And call it "George."
