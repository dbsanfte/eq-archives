Hardly.  If the raid (assuming indoors) is so slow as to lose SoW by the
time you move to your final destination, the move will still be slow because
it ALWAYS is slow.  People going the wrong way, missing the MOVE message,
lag, any number of reasons.

That's like saying it's possible for a raid to start on time if only they
had "such & such" a skill.  It ain't gonna happen.  Never has, never will.

Plus which, of course, not everyone will have it.  It's a skill with very
very few uses.  Monks, rogues and regular pullers, sure.  Why should any
caster have it?  It's useless.
