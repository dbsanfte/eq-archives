Last time I checked, the most you could advance was 5 per level, and I always
max out my five points in combat casting with mobs LONG before I ding.

Did I get a defective copy of EQ?

I want to stand in the Nexus, cast Summon Food a few hundred times, and have my
evocation be at 225!

THIS ISN"T FAIR!!!


Stop whining. It always amazes me to see a tank at my level fighting 2 mobs,
kill one, another comes along and joins mob #2, and then tank kills mob #2 and
turns to attack mob 3, and survives. If I ding, and cast a few hundred spells,
I have just wasted an hour of time, gotten no exp or loot, and my primary magic
skill has jumped a whopping 5 points from 165 to 170, or a gain of about 3%.
Meanwhile, Mr. Tank is about 10%-15% on his way to his next ding.
