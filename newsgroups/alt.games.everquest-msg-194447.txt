Now that Hanrahan has hit the 61 mile-marker teeth first, I've spent 
some time catching up with the single-player games I've missed out on 
for the last four years. The game I'm playing at the moment is 'Dungeon 
Siege', and I'm finding it amusingly reminiscent of EQ in quite a few 
ways... Typical EQ concepts like pulling, aggro management, mana 
conservation, pet control, adds, tanking, class balance, main healers 
and patch healers, and even loot whores crop up in the game, although 
not in exactly the same way as they do in EQ... For example, as the AI 
tries to keep all characters on screen at the same time, pulling becomes 
quite, er, interesting.

Anyway, I haven't finished it yet, so this is not really an attempt at a 
review (although I have to say I'm enjoying it very much), just an 
amused commentary of how EQ has forever colored my appreciation of all 
CRPGs.
