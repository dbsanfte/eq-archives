Look carefully at what you are saying here.

I am doing something that amuses me.  As it turns out, that
something involves "beating the system" by setting up a
cascade of "free" experience, while I'm afk.

But what exactly it is that I'm doing to amuse myself with
the game is irrelevant, isn't it?

Why am I playing the game?  To amuse myself.  Why am
I playing this particular character?  Because I am currently
in an odd situation where I need to go AFK quite frequently
and relatively unpredictably, I need to be able to do so without
infringing on anyone else's enjoyment of the game.

So, I needed a solo character, and decided to explore a
necromancer.  Its been quite a learning experience so
far, and I'm enjoying it a lot.  Necromancers are, unfortunately,
not really ideal for my purposes, since they are capable of
almost constant action, and aren't capable of conveniently
ducking out of action for long periods of time... FD for more
than a couple minutes and you lose the pet, likewise if you
invis at all.  So, I do get killed sometimes as a penalty for
going afk.  On the other hand, I can also set up situations
where I get free exp for being afk.  Can't see how this
is poetic justice at work?

Check out a little song by Harry Chapin sometime
called Roses Are Red, then get back to me on whether
you still insist that your way of having fun is the only way.
