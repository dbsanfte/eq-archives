Time to grow up and learn some facts friend....see below.

Wrong.
There is no way of knowing "HOW" you went LD. 
Did your cat trip over the power strip? 
Were you losing a fight and pulled the plug yourself?
Did a farmer in Iowa cut a DS3 line with his tractor?
Did a fool at the "Best Broadband Connection Money Can Buy" reboot a
switch, node, or router?

Here's another clue for you....

You do NOT have a direct connection to Sony/VI. You are relying on all
of the "hops" inbetween that are managed and run by ISPs, and the
major phone companies. Niether you nor VI/Sony has any control over
the quality of those connections.

>If VI wants to have a policy that LD death is just too bad move on, then they should announce this is the
>policy and tell people not to bother the preciouse GM's.

I don't know where you have been, but GMs have NEVER rezz'd for LD.
The only exception being when ALL of the servers have gone down, or
the problem *WAS* VI fault due to a bug or a server crash. 

>Hey, I know they are volunteers, but that is so VI can improve their gross magine. 

Wrong again.

GMs are paid VI/Sony employees. They KNOW when the system has gone
down. If a "whiney_bitch_01" petitions that they want a res for LD,
they know that the problem is *NOT* a bug or system faulure. Why
should they waste time answering all the crybabies that cannot grasp
the concept of Internet gaming and the idiosyncracies involved?

Guides are volunteers, and they often do not have the authority to
grant a CS res. 

Quit wasting GM/Guide time with your petty and stupid petitions.
Everyone goes LD from time to time. It is just the way things are. You
are just one out of @420,000. You aren't that important.

>There are 420,000 of us paying $12.95 a month - knucklehead - VI could afford paid
>help.

Verant has paid help. They also have massive overhead keeping all of
the servers up and running. They further have to fund development of
new content and new expansions. Your $12.95 a month doesn't rent a GM
to follow you around and res you everytime your connection drops.

>Heck, I would pay more for better GM responce times.

Move to Legends, pay the $40.00 a month it costs, and shut the hell
up.
