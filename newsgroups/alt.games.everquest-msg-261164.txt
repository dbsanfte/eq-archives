I don't know. This *is* usenet, and yours was the type of suggestion
that rightly warrants a strong response, at least in my book. You were
appealing to something indicative of what's wrong with EQ today - the
fact that too many people put too much energy into playing certain
classes because they are the flavor of the month or any reason other
than the fact that they somehow identify with it or find it interesting. 

No, you never said anyone should be "forced" to change classes. You
merely suggested that they should be talked into it. As I understand it,
the difference between the two can oftentimes be very slight. 

Honestly, if anything was "heavy handed" here, I'd say it was your plonk
finger.
