That isn't exactly a change brought about by the removal of the flags.
BoT was a cesspool even before then, at least on my server. Easy
camps. Phat loot, easy camps, easy to get too... 

HoH also had the entry flags removed and it's a much quieter zone.
Camps aren't as easy to get to and loot is worse so not many bother
with it.
