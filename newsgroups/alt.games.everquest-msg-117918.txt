When I did that quest, I got a level 60 ranger with good giant faction
to train Wenglawks to the WL zone, snare him, and zone out.  After the
train left, Wenglawks stayed behind (snared mobs without agro don't
move).

He's always been rumored to walk out of his room rarely giving you a
chance to talk to him in private, but I've never seen him do it.
Supposedly it's a very long interval between bathroom breaks for the
poor sod.
