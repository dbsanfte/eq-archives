If this is true, then Verant needs to work on the cleric.  Being the group
healer is the cleric's only real value to any group.  I don't know what can
be done to correct this, but something has to be done.  Suggestions?

Great.  Just great.  Just as in real life, clerics (pre-50) have to live off
the charity of others.

On the other hand, rarely do I ever have the "perfect" class combination in
any group.  And I've been in all types of combo groups and the success
factor wasn't really determined by what classes were represented but how
good of a player each was.

Lastly, I was planning on making my second character a wizard because I've
been enjoying nuking lately.  See original post why a cleric would be
nuking.  But if it is going to be a pain to get through 50 levels before I'm
wanted in a group, I'm not sure I'd want to go through that.
