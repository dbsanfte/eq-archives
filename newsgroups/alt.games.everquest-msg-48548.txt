I was helping 2 Wiz friends get their piece for the Staff of the Wheel at
different times the other day and noticed the 2 different boats.  What
really sucked is that they were running almost right after each other, like
the rafts between Oasis and Tim Deep tend to do.  That pretty much ruins the
idea of having 2 boats.

As for speed, I thought they were pretty danged fast, myself.  Then again,
speed is relative, and in the mind of the one taking it.
