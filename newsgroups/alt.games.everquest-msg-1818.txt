I haven't gotten ganked there since a guildmate showed me a trick:   Swim.
I jump into the water down at the river entrance and swim uphill, keeping an
alternating view above and below the water's surface. This is important, as this
weekend I came up against a spider sitting directly in the center of the river
channel on the bottom. I stopped and waited for him to move on to drier climes,
and continued on my way.
