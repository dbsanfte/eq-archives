Had an interesting PoV outer group last night:

me (SK)
Shammy
Mage
Monk
Monk
Monk

I discovered something cool: *NOT* being the puller! And the battlespam was
something to behold. We kept outer clear all the way to inner without any
trouble at all and I was still eating just over half an AA blue per kill.
Could've moved into Inner but it's never seems worth the bother to me ;)

Finally dinged ND3 in that camp. Now I'm going for 63. Screw AA!

Last night we headed into Veksar and camped (Surprise!) nobles. Made half a
level in the evening, and we managed to get a whole TWO named to spawn in
what had to be at least 20 cycles. Luckily the last one was ol' synthy, and
I tanked this nasty mob for the first time ever. Unkle Fester landed on the
pull which made it all a bit easy really. Shammy had him slowed when he
arrived and I'd managed to pre-land Bond of Death. Even still, I onl'y had
5.5k hp at the time and the druid had to heal me at least three times before
we chewed through Synth's 53k hitpoints.

That loverly neck piece dropped and I'm not wearing it, along with a big
grin.

cheers,
James
