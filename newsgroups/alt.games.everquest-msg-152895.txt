Fortunately, the SOW they run nearly as fast as is the lowest level SOW, so
jboots/tboots will get you away from them.  I don't know if runspeed 3 would
be fast enough, though.

I've encountered them twice.  First time, I was hunting stuff east of the
Kael entrance, and going back to near the ramp to med.  I cast Harvest to
get some mana, and the spell didn't finish.  I thought that was odd, and
cast it again.  Then I saw that the reason it didn't finish was that the
Death Squad was whacking me, and I took off running.

They don't seem to give up--they chased me all the way to Iceclad.

The second time, I was medding by the hut where that ghostly dwarf and the
dog are.  I was AFK, and when I came back, I found that I had been killed by
the Death Squad.  I was hidden, but they see through hide.
