Maybe the reason is that if you are in a group of others who are near or
above level 60, your slapping at a mob just will not keep it mad enough at
you compared to the level of damage your finger wiggler buddies are able to
dish out?  This link gives a few details about what changes are in the works

At the very bottom they talk about class balancing high level melees.  They
know that there is a problem with the amount of damage a high level melee
can dish out compared to the casters.

This may help hihger level Melees keep agro longer.  Who really knows until
they actually patch it.
