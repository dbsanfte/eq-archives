OK, let's turn this on it's head for a second. You know what you think
it's NOT there for, so why do you think they did it?

You clearly do not think the HiV+ muppet is being introduced for a
'tolerance' message, so why DO you think the execs in charge decided to
take a step they must've known would have discussions like this going on
all over the place? 

I don't think the 'all publicity is good publicity' adage works here.
Maybe if it was some NEW TV show, looking for press for free placement
and massive exposure, but this is Sesame Street. I think we can agree
they are one of the biggest 'educational' related shows for that age-
group in the world by quite a margin.

So why, in your opinion, did they take this step?
