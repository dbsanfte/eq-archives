Here is a link about that. I have heard that too, but with so many
sources it is a little suspect as to whether or not it was really said.

Mind you, I'm not saying anything good or bad about Scientology but I
have heard other interesting things. Like Tom Cruise had to pay BIG time
to leave and that John Travolta is under contract to do more Battlefield
Earth movies.(Battlefield Earth being written by Hubbard, for all you
not seeing a connection) Both Scientologists, um...Scientologyers,
um...Scientologerists, um...belong to the cult.
