I had an interesting thing hadden there I was going to Tox  and zoned in to
the Nexus from Shadow Haven after the third place I had check I found the
portal to Tox. There was no announcements as yet and I had sat there for
about 30 sec when I noticed the second gate keeper. I had hailed the Toxian
Gate keeper to check and see if I needed something special and Poof I was
ported to Tox. Don't know if it was just good timming or what.
