I dont go around just randomly trying to browse 450+ chars, but i do the 
window shopping once in a while, usually on chars i know.

Got a player thats one of the major traders, shes always parked at same 
spot, and if i see her, i check her prices, because she life for profit, 
and you can see the max prices for a item by watching her inventory, 
good to see the max prices on some of the 100K+ items sometimes.

Im a tailor, and if i see someone selling the same as me, i usually go 
look in their inventories to see what they got (since you cant search 
for playerXX in the bazaar window, but have to scroll down through 500 
chars, half the time its faster to run over and check the persons 
inventory out yourself).

And if see a person that look interesting (naked ogre XXX is always 
good, same are PKs and people with weapons i never seen before), i take 
a peek at their goods, found many good items that way.
