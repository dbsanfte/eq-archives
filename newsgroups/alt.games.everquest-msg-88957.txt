I, for one, *don't* want EQ to assume I'm LD after only 10-15
seconds.  My crappy ISP often (say, once an hour) just _stops
dead_ for 10-15 seconds.  But then, connectivity comes back,
and EQ keeps functioning normally.

Verant *had* to pick a reasonable number of seconds of non-
response from the client and consider that a broken connection.
10-15 seconds is far too low.  Lots of people lag spike for
around that number of seconds.  Considering lack of response
from the client for that short number of seconds LD is totally
unreasonable.
