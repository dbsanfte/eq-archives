From the article the christian community offered support to the wiccans
while the obnoxious protestors would not identify their affiliation.  Just
because someone quotes the bible does not make them understand or follow the
bible.  That was *not* a christian demonstration.  The bible is freely
available for anyone to use and unfortunately some people will misuse
anything.  What can you do?
