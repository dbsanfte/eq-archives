Was on hand to see a guildie's corpse poof from BoT a couple weeks back.

He died and logged without a rez.  The following day RL circumstances that
were outside his control took him away from his computer (any computer)
for over 2 weeks.

A bit earlier we were worried about the same thing happening to another
guildie - she had  corpse in Tactics and was pulled out of town because her
father-in-law's stem cell therapy took precedence.  She got back with a 
day left on her timer.

I think that's likely.  "Hey, we can do this now, why don't we just add
a bit of extra code and make it the norm?"

What boggles my mind is that there are a number of posts in the thread
on the Tower regarding this that flame the new idea.  Basically it's
"*I* had to do it that way, *everyone* should have to do it that way."
