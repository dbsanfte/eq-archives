Ok, I'll grant you enough in-game logic to that scenario to say that
explains it. However, it would be just as easy to say that the storm
giants are *in league* with the Frost Giants, work and live together in
Kael, etc. and might some day come pounding into GD to raise hell, so
they would also have to be an "enemy" in the eyes of the dorfs. 

Ah well, nothing for it but to go back and camp the entrance on the EW
side a bit more I suppose, unless I'm already warmly with the dorfs.
Still need to go check.
