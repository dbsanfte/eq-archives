I am using that same mobo but with an Athlon 2100+.  I have built many
systems and make my living as a computer tech, and let me tell you....as
much as I *swear* by Asus mobo's, this is the biggest piece of shit I have
ever bought from them.  It took my a week to even get it to accept an O/S
without hassles.  EQ would just crash and other games would work, albeit
half-assed.
To get things to work I took a stab in the dark.  When it came time to
install the VIA 4-in-1 drivers, I only installed ones that were Micro$oft
certified (this is the only time I've found this nag screen to be worth
anything) and have had little problem since.
However, I stand by my word that this is a toilet of a mobo.  Upon more
research I have found that there is a long-standing issue with VIA chipsets
and some Athlon processors.  In a couple discussion groups I was instructed
to try a board with SiS chipset.  I'm a tech, but I'm not rich, so I'm stuck
with mine for now...BUT...I've built a couple systems using the Athlon/SiS
combo and it does indeed run pretty sweet.

TAKE THAT BOARD BACK!  Asus makes really good stuff and one badly made board
isn't swaying me away, but save yourself some headaches.

Sean...
