Kiting in Eastern wastes is good too!
Yes people do pay for that stuff.  Around 20 PP each for toes and heads on
Tholuxe Paells in the bazaar.  HQ Tundra Kodiak pelt up to 300 PP.   Cougar
claw earrings are around 200 PP, Snow dervishes and blizzard dervishes drop
Frozen Mantles, they sell for at least 20 PP.  Torque of Hoar Frost and Woven
Frost Giant Beard sell for 10 to 20.  And of course the velious weapons get 4
PP from the vendors.
