I tried the EQ windows version just a few ago, it doesn't like me or
I'm doing something wrong.

Ran 2 different EQs from 2 different directories.

Tried to alt tab and goes to a small bar in the upper left corner. I
have to keep hitting alt-enter to bring up full screen...is this
normal or am I doing something wrong?
