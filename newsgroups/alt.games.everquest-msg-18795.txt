I know this has been asked here before, but I couldn't
turn-up the info in my newsserver, so I guess I'll ask
it again.

I desire to change both the billing method and the credit
card that is billed for my EQ account.  I originally
subscribed to EQ at with the monthly option, since I didn't
know if I'd like it, and now that I do, I'd like to change
to the every-three-months option.  Also, I'm getting a
different card that I want to use for EQ billing.

So, as logic would dictate, I headed over to
http://www.station.sony.com/
and went to the My account section.  After entering my name
and password, I was admitted and I could see the past few
months that I've been billed for my EQ service.

Once in there, I tried both "subscribe to new programs or
cancel your current subscriptions" and "view or change your
billing information using our secure server".

Both options say that they don't have my billing information
on file, yet they are definitely billing my credit card
every month, as both my statement and their website indicates.

Do I have to fill-out all the name/address crap on Station to
get to the change credit card section of the site?  I'd prefer
not to provide all that info as the amount of trash-mail I
get is already sizeable and I can only imagine that Sony will
sell my name/address to anyone with a few bucks in their hand,
thus multiplying the trash-mail sitation even more...

Thanks,
Mike
