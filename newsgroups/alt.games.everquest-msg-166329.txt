Hotkeys? Do you think that as a bard twisting my songs changing intruments
for weapons and the other way around, adding melee commanding a charmed mob
have time to press it? Have mercy on my carpal tunnels and do you expect me
to switch hotbanks just for a stupid reply to a campcheck? It's for ppl who
are to lazy to go the way and see what is going on. Never do a campcheck
myself either. Checking the place out to see if it is camped is better
anyway. Never noticed that ppl reply for you quite often? Like they want to
claim your place because nobody else did?
