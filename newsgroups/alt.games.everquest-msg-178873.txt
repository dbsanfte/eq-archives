SoW potions are cheap.  If you're not out there slaughtering PHs you're
just parasiting off the people who are.  That's why I detest every Bard
I've ever seen hunting HGs, and many of the Druids/Necros/Wizards.
The few Mages I've seen out there, OTOH, were very good about using
their pets to kill PHs.

I don't see a 2.5 hour base duration regen buff in that list.

Pretty much all of what you said in response was in terms of solo play,
which ignores the fact that the game was designed for grouping.  My
main bitch about KEI was that it makes it trivial for casters to solo.
The penalty a caster used to have to pay for soloing was downtime.
Even as it was, the effective soloing classes could xp 10x as fast as
a twinked melee.  Hell, depending on where you're fighting, the Druids,
Wizards, and Necros can xp much faster solo than they can partnered
with a well-equipped melee of the same level, which is just stupidly
wrong.  Even with favorable circumstances and good tactics it is not
easy for a Druid (and may not be possible for a Wizard) to get equal
or better xp partnered with a melee than they can solo (at least not
anyplace I've been in the pre-PoP world, and what I hear of PoP it
sounds worse there).  Ah well, enough ranting, have a nice day!  :)
