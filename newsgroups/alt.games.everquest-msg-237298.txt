There is a 4th (or so) level guard in Qeynos Catacombs. Guards that
are actually guarding range from 15-65+, the guards at the bridge in
Nek forest are lower end, but you probably don't want to kill them.
Nothing special to guards though.

I would go and experiment in Timorous Deep, at the wood elf village.
That will give you a good taste for ravaging a city. Expect to FD a
few time hehe.

When you get up there you can start doing some Felwithe Raids, those
Koada'dal are good exp and decent loot.
