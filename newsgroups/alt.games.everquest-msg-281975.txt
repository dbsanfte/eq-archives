I let my son order gold for the World of Warcraft game from
Yantis/MySuperSales.Com. I figured it was a cheap way to teach him
about scam artists on the internet. As I expected after sending these
scammers a money order he received ***nothing***. My son has had
several chat sessions with the people from MySuperSales.com however,
they spew nothing but lame excuse after lame excuse as to why he hasn't
been sent his merchandise. Word of caution for anyone thinking they can
do business with this clown. Just my 2 cents...
