The last time I was in a DKP guild we did the following.

1pt for all those at the start of the raid (if it started at 5pm list was
taken at 5pm even if we did not leave until 6pm because not enough people)

1pt for all at the raid taken at the hour each hour of the raid, you had to
be in one of the previous point lists (either you showed up on time, or this
was the second hour list). (LD, you were not in the 1pt, sucked to be LD at
the hour mark, but no arguments)

1pt for every failed boss attempt

xpt for a boss, this number went down each time we did a specific encounter,
it started at like 10 I think and every time we succeeded the next time it
was one less util it was only worth 1pt.

2pts for everyone there when the raid broke up, if you were in at least 2
other lists.



This helped to keep people around to the bitter end as well.



If it was for an epic, who ever got the epic piece got no points.



Officer bid channel with any officer wanting to bid on an item dropping out
of the channel. One "normal" member in this channel as well, chose by a
random from those there at the start (just to get someone outside the
officers in the channel)



Cost = total of second highest bidder + 1 if more than one, if only one
person it was your total DKP / 2 + 1, it somewhat encourage point hording
since you would still end up with points after buying something. If there
was a tie it was a roll off with the it being as if the looser did not even
bid to determine cost.



So if player1 has 100, player2 has 100, player3 has 60, and all 3 want it,
it will cost the winner of a roll off between 1 & 2 61 points. If only 1 & 2
then it would have cost 51 points.



The only thing that we did when we first went to the points, we "seeded" the
guild with 15 free points.



Lastly we had no non-allowed bids, except on NO DROP for obvious reasons, so
if you wanted something for an alt go for it. At first people hated that
rule because they were afraid alts would get things over a main, but
sometimes we had people bring alts to fill holes etc. or 2-box, it was
easier than trying to come up with special circumstance situations and
rules. As it turned out, people really don't bid for alts too often, usually
if something was going to rot, but there were times when the alt would win
over a main, but the bidder usually regretted it later.



We did bidding at the time of the drop most of the time to stop some of the
bidding for alts, because you had no idea what may drop later, etc.



Now that I moved to FV. I need to get to a raid level again :)

(I hope this is in PT and not HTML, copied it to Word to spell check)
