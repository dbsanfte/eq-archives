Personally, I ask if it's ok to PP. But if I'm in a bad group I have a
social button that does it for me. I have it setting autoattack to off, then
pp, then hide, then bs, then autoattack on. This works really well because
you get a pp attempt and a bs at the same time. Plus you are hiding before
the bs, so it's possible that if you have the agro and can't get the mob off
you the hide gets you down on the hate list and then your bs will hit. Just
my 2cp worth.
