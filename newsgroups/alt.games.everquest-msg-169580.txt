I'm a bit of a writer, 'ma self. I kinda like 'ta think that I'm pretty good
with giving the reader a general idea of how my character talks. As Katrika
said before, "A little goes a long way."

Do 'ya know of Brer Rabbit an' Miss Cow? I suggest 'ya take the time 'ta
look it up...

http://makeashorterlink.com/?F2E412AC2

Now, I don't know about'chu, but I find it rather hard to read. Hell, I need
a damned magical decoder ring!

Let'see if I can find somethin' better...

That link right there leads to sort of a translated adventure of Brer
Rabbit. When I was a wee boy, I always hated Brer Rabbit 'cause it was so
god damn hard 'ta read. Maybe if I had read the modified version I would'a
liked it.

Suh, I say, Suh, you have 'affended my honour! I know I'm only a
stereotypical Colonel of the Confederate States of America, but I have
feelin's too!

Somethin' tells me this 'fella takes things too literally. I don't know
'bout'chu, but I kinda figured that was sort of'uh example. Not one 'ta
dwell on.

<shoots Colonel Kenny and Uneducated Kenny repeatedly>

Incoherent bastards... anyhow, as those two stereotypes pointed out, the
excessive bastardization of words makes things hard to read. As with
role-playing and writing, time is crucial. The longer your reader has to
think about what you said, the less interested they are in what you wrote.

Admittedly, I'm not that great with Southern accents but, I like to think I
got my message across while keeping myself relatively coherent. That is the
trick with writing and even role-playing.
