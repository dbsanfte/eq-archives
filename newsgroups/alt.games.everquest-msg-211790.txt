Was using bow but he was also the puller leaving before a mob was down. He
only had ~100 aa and a bow from.. I think one of the elemental planes. He
switched to his primal bow now and then so that would have cut his dps a
bit. According to him his normal dps is around 200-210, but hey, he has
several tiers higher gear then me (my guild is just up for NToV) :P
We also tended to push the mob into the corner so we had less problems with
adds but the ranger couldn't shoot then so had to resort to melee. Pets and
nukers have less problems with mobs moving or in walls :).
