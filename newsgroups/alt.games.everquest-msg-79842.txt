I am also using the PC Zone CD. Sound is fine. I heard there was a 
problem with Soundacard Live users. (I am a Live user (Win 98)) You 
could see if there any newer drivers.

Also check the options on the basic screen (F10) I think I remeber that 
the sound and music were defaulted to quite quiet turn them up (right 
most)
