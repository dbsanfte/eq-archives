Do your prayer shawl. 65 enchanter can solo all but a couple of parts.
Ornate legs are nice too, clicky c4. Great when you get killed in LDON (or 
anywhere).
SSra has some decent upgrades for you. XTC drops a ft6 shield (then you can 
sell that belt)
HP drops a decent headpiece. Cursed drops a nice range. Glyph drops a decent 
belt. VZ drops a nice neckpiece.

lots of good stuff in VT, you should do VT before trying to progress through 
POP.
