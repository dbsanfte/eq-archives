Others already answered, so I'll just add this:

Don't go overboard.

- Long macros are cute the first time you use them...they get old fast.
- No one cares to hear how you've DOTed a critter or buffed a friend.  It
just adds to the spam.

The most possible spell spam anyone would want to hear from a druid is "%t
is SNARED" or "Healing %t"

DO NOT create a "Snaring %t" macro built into your snare button.  We do NOT
need to hear your first 4 fizzles, a couple interrupts and 2 that were
resisted.  Let us know AFTER you've done your job, we've got enough to read,
thanks!

In case you're taking this like I'm accusing you of wanting to do it, I'm
not.  Don't be so freakin' paranoid. :P <g>
