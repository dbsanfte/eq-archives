Well, we'll see how this runs.

HP Pavilion from CircuitCity:

Celeron 466Mhz
96 MB RAM
Windows 98
150W PSU
8MB ATI Rage Pro Onboard video
Everquest ran like a charm, Kunark a slight lag.

************************************************************************

Improved version:

Celeron 466Mhz
512 MB RAM
Windows 2000
300W PSU
64MB GF3 Ti200
We'll see about EQ.

I had an extra 256 MB stick to throw in there so I only had to
purchase 1. Bought a new case well:

For better ventilation than the box that came with the HP Pavilion.
All in all, spent a total of $150 bucks on the upgrades.
