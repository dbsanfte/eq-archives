  Can guides poof MoBs?  I'm just curious about that.  I was under the impression
that guides, at least the lower level ones, were limited in scope to summoning people
out of walls and "passing things up".
   As to this starting post, is seems clear to me that we're not getting the whole
story, if only because the originator doesn't know the whole story.  Maybe the person
that was being addressed by the GM/Guide (whichever) was abusive in person, or sent
him/her a nasty tell?  I don't think that poofing Tunare would be an appropriate
response if that had happened, but my point is we don't know _what_ happened.

Annie <--- Doubts if she will ever see Tunare, much less try to kill her.
