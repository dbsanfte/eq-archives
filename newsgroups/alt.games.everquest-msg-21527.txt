Well i would agree with you on the principle, after all it's your character
and you play it the way you like. The only thing is..I got recently killed
in a group and when I asked the group Cleric why he didn't give me any heal
as the mobs were beating me to a pulp, he simply said "I don't heal others
generally, and I was busy fighting". Hey, it's his right to do so...but one
would think that clerics are mainly asked in groups for this ability they
have to heal really well. If this is not their goal to heal others, they
should at least say it prior to creating groups, or as introducing
themselves to group leaders, it would avoid surprises later on.

"19 Cleric LFG. Send tell...I don't heal others"...hmmm.
