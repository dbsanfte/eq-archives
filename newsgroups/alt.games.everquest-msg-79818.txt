Staff of Writhing started to proc for me at 27, and quite often at that. 
  I personally plan on keeping it for a while yet and I just dinged 31. 
  I haven't really done much research into a better weapon though so I 
guess I could ask the same question, is there something better out there 
for a decent price?  Tarew Marr server if it matters.
