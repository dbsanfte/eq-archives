I've asked that same question of this NG. No one had an answer.
I also asked Verant and their Tech Support said nope. No such program
exists.
I do however recall reading/hearing somewhere that they have certain ports
open on thier servers for certain types of info. As to what info is tunneled
to those ports I don't know. I don't think they would allow people to see
who is online, but I have seen a couple of sites that have the # of people
playing. I don't know how they got that info, but maybe it is one of the
things that can be discovered when sniffing the port.
