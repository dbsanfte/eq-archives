They extended the size of the friends and ignore lists I believe.  
Personally, I have all ooc, shout, say, and chat channels go to one window 
that I can safely ignore.  I have group, and raid, and any important chat 
channels go to a different window, and I have battle spam go to a third 
window.  I probably have a grand total of 2 people on my ignore list, as I 
have no trouble just ignoring them by simply not reading what they have to 
say.
