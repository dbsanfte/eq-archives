Orcs and stuff. You could kill militia also if you don't care about
the rest of freeport but orcs is easy. I had a dark elf cleric of
innoruuk and it was not that hard to go from deep threaten to dubious
with them. 

Screw around selling stuff in EC and if you are a caster just snare
orcs when people are fighting them or if a big nuker or big melee
damage class just run up and punch them once (to make sure you don't
kos) I guess if you were a monk you could maybe breathe on them.. or
wait until they were almost dead for sure.

Often I've found no one is doing the west commons orc camp in the
hollow by the zone wall at all. That is why its hilarious to me to see
people fighting over the camps in EC. Even as a very low level I just
went and did the WC one. One bad thing about doing it when you are
higher level though is that it will be totally devoid of players with
no one doing it then the first time that you break and clear it
suddenly "lil vultures" show up now that its broken and lay guilt
trips on you ;)
