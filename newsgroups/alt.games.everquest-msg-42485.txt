You can take this bullshit line and shove it up your ass. Yes, I have
money for leisure expenses - very carefully rationed into my budget. I
can cover $9.89 for EQ on top of my other *REQUIRED* expenses. Any
money I have left over goes into emergency savings.

Another $3.33/month may not sound like much, but for some of us, even
that little requires re-arranging of budgeting.

No, I'm not going to pay it. But that doesn't mean I'm not entitled to
dislike the fact that the charge is there.

All these banner ad sponsors that never paid out...I've seen sites
complaining, but not a single one have I seen mention even attempting
to do anything about it... If the subject is brought up to them, the
only response is generally along the lines of "it's too much trouble".

My biggest complaint about Allakhazam charging? He's charging because
of the amount of bandwidth costing so much. As someone else pointed
out, a good 75% of that bandwidth is "fluff" - unnecessary images. Why
do I need to see a screenshot of stats on an item when they list the
EXACT SAME information in text as well? Why do I need to see
screenshots of 20 different varieties of goblins that all look
identical in the beastiary? Then there's pages of commentary on every
single item/quest from users, most of which is trivial bickering and
other tripe.
