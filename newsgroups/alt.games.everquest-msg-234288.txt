I think these discussions always share the same flaw: they focus only on the
upside scenario.

If things go according to plan, then any single-class group (almost any
group at all, really) can do fine. What really makes the difference is how
well a group can handle things going _wrong_, as they inevitably do in
actual gameplay rather than a chalkboard exercise.

That's the problem for the all-warrior group, for example: no form of crowd
control nor any way to heal quickly. One significant overpull and the
all-warrior scenario collapses fast.

Same with an all-wizard group. The wizzies can root the mob, count down, and
together nuke it to death in one group blast....but a one or two fizzles
means the mob is not killed, just wounded. Root breaks, angry mob tears
nearest wizzie into little pieces faster than others can reload and fire. Or
worse yet, mob at 10% runs off and brings back friends...it gets real ugly
real fast.

An all-enchanter or all-bard group would offer the best crowd control to
stabilize a crisis situation. But a drawback is that they can't put out
great DPS which means they won't earn exp terribly fast (and might have
trouble winning an LDoN adventure simply on time); also the chanters can't
heal at all and the bards can only do it slowly.

It seems logical that considering both the best-case and worst-case
situations in EQ exp grouping, that the best single-class choices would be
versatile classes that include at least decent DPS and a reasonable ability
to take some pounding. The strongest candidates would seem to be beastlords,
paladins, and rangers (all ranger jokes notwithstanding). Each of those
classes has some form of crowd control (however kludgy), some ability to
heal themselves, and at least average DPS.

I may be limiting the field too much for lack of knowledge about every
class, but... I didn't include mages or necros on the grounds that they
can't survive even a little bit of crowd-control failure on an overpull.
Druids' DPS seems too low. I'm not sure how good shammies' crowd control is,
and we haven't specified level -- shaman DPS before they get their pet is
pretty low. Etc.
