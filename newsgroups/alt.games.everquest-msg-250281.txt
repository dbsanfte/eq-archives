If my guild is a weathervane, then a further summit in 6 months will
only serve as a wake. As recently as 2 weeks ago, we had a roster of 137
members. last night when it disbanded, 31. A few have moved up to guilds
that exclusively raid, the rest were simply MIA after deguilding
themselves.

I myself play very sporadically now, CoH has grabbed me for the time
being, but I've noticed a dramatic drop in friends being online. My 58
Cleric is usually inundated with tells to do LDoN's, but last night, I
couldn't even find a group, so farmed tradeskill items...sigh!
