Source for silks in the general Qeynos area:

1) The Qeynos Catacombs.
2) Everfrost...the tundra section.  (this can be frustrating, as the silk
drops are sparse on the spiders there).
3) Erud's Crossing/Wisp Isle.  These spiders group, and their poison seems
nasty for their level.  I suggest not doing this solo unless the spiders con
green to you...otherwise, bring a group.  Bring a cleric or other caster who
can keep keep you buffed up with Resist Poison.
