Oh, I know the answer to this.  I've dealt with in during my product
development.

Every project has an executive sponsor... some are unfortunate enough to
have an Executive Committee...

They say "I don't give a good-god-damn WHAT it will take.  I want that thing
delivered on May 15th come hell or high water!"

Developers: "But it's not thoroughly tested...."

Exec:  "Get it out.  Fix it afterwards...   My butt and your's are hanging
on this delivery date.  We can deal with the fall out later..."

Developers:  "But we haven't even finished all the use-cases... there may be
other unforseen problems...  When we created this calendar, no one had any
idea about <this> and <this>...  Look at the bug list...  I've got 20 pages
of change requests..."

Exec:  "Look, you've got it proto-typed...  it works, right?  So, just get
it out there.  It won't be bad..."

Developers:  <<sigh>>

----release----

Exec:  "What the f*ck was that piece of sh*t you released..."

Developers:  << sigh >>  (I wonder if Maxis in hiring...)
