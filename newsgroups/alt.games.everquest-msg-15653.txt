The answer to your question is yes, I would tell the world if I
stopped playing "Game X". But not if I just stopped liking it or
finished it. But if there were a game-stopping bug, or severe hardware
conflicts or such then I would. That's what the newsgroups are for
Pedro. I don't recall anyone asking you to make up the posting rules.

You know, you should head over to the war-historical newsgroup.
There's a guy named Old Salt you should meet. You two would get along
famously...
