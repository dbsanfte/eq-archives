The trick is to get it so that they're naked, but still have the right
colors ;)  Had a similar glitch a while back, but only male dwarves and
gnomes had any color *shudder*  The trees in PoK looked really really cool
though.

To fix: delete all .txc files in your everquest directory.  If that doesn't
solve it, turn off texture caching entirely.  It sounds like there might be
a discrepancy between the way WinXP writes the files and the way Win98 would
have written them, causing Win98 to see them as corrupted and basically just
nukes all your textures.
