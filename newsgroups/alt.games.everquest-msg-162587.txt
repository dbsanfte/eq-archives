I think he's talking about the proccing hammers and
a couple of (other?) upgrades in cleric melee capabilities,
such as Bashing at level 25.

With Druids/Shamans getting a complete-ish heal they
probably figured there was a need to compensate
somehow. So they made clerics able to tank. The logic
escapes me, personally... when I started playing a cleric,
tanking wasn't really what I had in mind. :-)

Better than nothing, I suppose. And at least allows
some alternative strategies in soloing - the existing
strategies being
(1) root and nuke, and
(2) root and melee, backoff, heal, melee...
Though if I understand rightly they more or less expanded
on strategy 2. Not at those levels yet, myself.
