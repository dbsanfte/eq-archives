  I agree with giving a person the benefit of the doubt, and at low levels
the penalty for dying is minor enough that it doesn't really annoy me all
that much... but it sounds like in this case, the wizard was pretty stupid.
It's one thing to pull and nearly kill the group once, it's another thing to
do it the exact same way again.  But it also depends on the reaction of the
group.  If nobody was asking questions about what the wizard was doing and
why, you can't really expect an explanation and you have to expect that it
might happen again.  If you're going to group with inexperienced players (as
you should expect you will be doing if you hunt in zones like Oasis), you
have to be tolerant of their mistakes, but you also have to be bold enough
to point out their mistakes and make sure they don't happen again.  If the
person isn't receptive to your criticisms and suggestions, that's when you
hit disband.
