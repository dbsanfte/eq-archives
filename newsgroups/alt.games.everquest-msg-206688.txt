In my experience yes.

First spell after a good fear should be a stun. This leaves them stunned,
still feared, still facing away, still taking damage. Because of the slow
cycle times of the chanter nukes, you have plenty of time to stun while
waiting for your DD button to cycle. You can even melee it a bit while it is
stunned. Everytime they break stun, just cast it again. If they break fear,
just apply it again followed by a stun. Just make sure you never root or you
use up your supply of tiny daggers pretty quick.

There may be better ways of soloing a chanter but I've found this way as
easy to solo as any other magic user.
