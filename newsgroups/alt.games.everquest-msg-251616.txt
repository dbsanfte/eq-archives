Just to be technical, this isn't strictly true.  You don't get all the 
exp if you get the killing shot in; you have to outdamage all other 
persons or groups attacking the mob.  Its quite possible to be the one 
who kills the mob but have someone else get the exp... and its quite 
possible not to kill the mob but to get the exp.

This aside, there are other forms of help; healing someone, casting a 
buff on them, DSing them; none of these count as damage, and its ONLY 
damage which decides who gets the kill.

Then you can Debuff the mob, reducing its strength, dex, attack, AC... 
none of these do any damage, so they don't count

More, you could even root, stun, blind, fear the mob without doing any 
damage to it (there are roots and stuns which do damage, but there are 
some which don't)...  these are almost certainly not going to be 
recieved well though as they can really interefere with the tactics the 
person fighting is using.

Any of the above has one drawback; if you help someone who is engaged 
with a mob with any of them, you'll take any faction hit if the mob dies 
(unless you've zoned before that happens), and if the guy you were 
trying to help dies, you will be next on the "hit list".  I've healed 
someone only to have him run to the zone line past several other mobs, 
all of which added in, then all of which turned to attack me once he was 
gone!

Also, all of the above is largely academic, since as you mentioned, the 
ettiquette of EQ is NOT to help unless requested (or unless the victim 
is shouting TRAIN)
