That's right. And TO THIS DAY Houstonians are still having to put up
with outsiders still making this false "claim." It's ridiculous.

Houston is not and has never been "most polluted" or had the "worst
air" in the nation.

According to the EPA, there are 6 measures of air pollution. Houston's
violation was on only one measure; ground-level ozone. In 1999 and
2000 alone, it was higher than other cities on this one measure, and
for the first time higher than Los Angeles. However, there are 5 other
measures of air pollution, and several cities (including Los Angeles)
violate 2 or 3 of these.

"Houston's air violates only one of the EPA's six criteria pollutant
standards -- ozone. Nine other cities violate two or three of the
EPA's pollutant standards. Source: U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency "

"According to the EPA, there are five regions that had worse overall
air quality in 1999 than Houston as measured by the EPA's Air Quality
Index. Leading the pack is Riverside, California with 93 days in which
the Air Quality Index exceeded 100. Bakersfield at 88 days and Fresno
at 81 were next highest then Atlanta with 61 days, followed by
Knoxville with 59 days. Houston was sixth with 50 days. Source: U.S.

"Anyone who claims that Houston's smog problems are equal to or worse
than L.A.'s is misinformed," says Kay Jones, a former EPA official who
now consults on air quality."

"In some ways, calling Houston America's smoggiest city misrepresented
the relative quality of air in the two cities. Los Angeles' air is
worse than Houston's in other categories. But ozone is the primary
pollutant of concern and therefore gets more attention, officials
said."
