Well, I've done this several times.    If you stay at the absolute top of the
zone edge, you should be pretty safe.    It's never certain though.

I've done it perhaps 10 times, both with and without SoW.    I only died once,

(He ran up to me, waited a second for them to switch to the new closest target
and gated out.)
