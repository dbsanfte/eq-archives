Not really.  She got one helpful reply.  The others were useless and
mocking.  SR simply mentioned hacking/cracking as a possibility with
that "question", not necessarily what she assumed happened.

It would have been a hell of a lot different had she posted: "the web
site is down and so are teh game servers!  EQ has been hacked!"
But she just asked "what's up?", mentioning hacking as a possibility,
which is certainly IS, even if not the most likely one.

Well, if this group is to lazy to read the bodies of messages (at
which point it would have been clear that the post was in no way a
troll) it wouldn't have that problem.
