That reminds me of a conversation near Freeport (on AB):

Anti-RPer: I can't stand those people (roleplayers), blah blah blah.
RP'er:  If you think of RPers as "those people", why did you play on this
server?
Anti-RPer: Because my friends are here.
Me: So your friends are some of "those people" then?
Anti_RPer: No.
Me: So why are THEY here?
Anti-RPer: *crickets chirping*

I don't get some people. And obviously they wouldn't get themselves either
if they tried.
