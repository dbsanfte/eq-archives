I don't like them.
I don't like any big guilds, they cause SOE to design content mainly
for big raiding guilds while I mostly solo. 

The last expansion for me was Luclin, though for some strange reason I
bought the rest (including 2x LOY POP and lost dungeons, for two
boxing accounts) After failing mission after mission, while waiting 2
hours for pick up groups, I'm finally out of EQ I think. I cancelled
both accounts and have not had the urge to resubscribe (though I've
not deleted and no, you can't have my stuff (you'd likely not want it
anyway .. ) )

The direction that EQ is going in is twofold, both alienating users
like me:

1) total newbie, such changes as max sense heading, maps in newbie
zones, etc.

2) raiding high level player with lots of friends/guild people to help
with loot aquisition.

The people in the middle get shat on.
