For approximately half the cost of a Cane of Tranquil or Cane of Harmony
(about 800-1000pp on karana) I got ahold of an Essence of Dol and an
Enameled Black Mace that serve me just fine, and that left plenty for
getting a full set of Wu's (about 700pp). I am L13 now and not even
beginning to lose steam, powering through most yellows solo and only
occasionally breaking into a sweat when Mend fails.
