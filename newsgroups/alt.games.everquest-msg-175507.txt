Actually I will grant you co2 if you consider that pollution (I do not) .
Though even your cited chart did not break it down to population or surface
area and thus is highly misleading. It also failed to add china and russia
both of which are pretty copius producers. Basically using a deliberately
misleading chart and then lying by omission.

Carbon dioxide represents 1.2% of the worlds atmosphere . It was 1.2% 500
years ago and is still 1.2% today . Whatever effect we have had is thus
kinda minimal overall . Airtight systems do not like to go over 5% co2
because at that point it begins to become toxic. Every breath you take
brings in oxygen and breathes out co2. It is a normal componet of our
atmosphere is what I am trying to get accross, we also know exactly where
the danger levels are and what effect those levels have. Global warming is
not a scientific theory it is a religion. To try and point out where I am
wrong you will have to actually come up with data . Not the ramblings of the
faithfull.

Actually I dont care about co2. I really dislike some of the complex sulfur
compounds , the cyanides , NO , O3 ,and some really nasty carbon acid chains
that tend to get produced at the same time . I am also willing to compromise
with the faithfull of the enviromental religion :) While we do a much better
job than anyone else reducing the types that are dangerous , they still
matter. Idiotic to do it this way when better ways exist.

If your going to give links you might as well give a good one . Its wrong on
alot of stuff but at least is scientifically based.
