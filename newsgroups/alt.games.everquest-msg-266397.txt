I presume you mean 'adult'?

I also noticed you failed to mention which birthday. In some places its 
18, in others 19, in still others 21... so the legal definition of 
'adult' is regional.

And in many of these regions people debate on moving it up a year or 
back 2 or whatever. And that is perfectly rational to debate.

Correct. But it doesn't mean they are in the best places either.

That's all well and fine. But that doesn't really bear on whether or not 
terminating a 9 month old fetus is wrong, but a 4 month one is ok. 

The lines drawn, as you conceded, are arbitrary. There is no reason to 
conclude without due consideration that the OPs proposed lines are "less 
right".
