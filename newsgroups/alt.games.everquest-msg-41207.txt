Yes. I have heard more jingoistic nonsense here at work (in Houston,
Texas, USA) than I ever wanted to hear in my life. What is so
upsetting is how many people agree with the mindset of "lets nuke the
ENTIRE middle east. Kill all of them and you will get the guilty
ones".
(Yes, those sentiments have been vocalized, with much agreement. Here
at work, on the metro buses, in stores.)

Scary. And the idiot son is president. I am very scared.
