This was easily tested by approaching a mob you were not KOS to, then 
taunting.  You'd get this message and the mob would do nothing, more 
often than not, occaisionally though it would turn on you with a vengeance.

This is because taunt will put you on the hate list, one point higher 
than anyone else... which means a mob that hates nobody will have you at 
a massive one point, but still enough to try and kill you.

A fail message means you can actually tell how you are doing, 
particularly handy when breaking mez.

Splendid
