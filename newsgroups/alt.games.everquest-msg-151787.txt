This changes, both as you progress in levels, and as you get into
"non-standard" group configurations. There are a lot of mobs on raids
who have so many damned HP, and take so long to kill, that it is safe to
start filtering in nukes and concussions long before half. The mini's in
Fear and Hate are some low end examples of this. I start hitting them at
75% or sooner. 

Many dragon kills, and other "unique" mobs like VS (who as to be killed
Very Very Fast [tm] or you all die) require the wizards to go full burn
from very near the beginning.

Fear kite groups, and some other oddball situations require that the
wizard get and hold aggro early. The groups I'm most commonly in these
days with Team Necro [tm] have me both pulling, and intentionally
keeping myself on top of the Hate list at all times.

At the low to mid levels in "standard" unholy trinity groups, yes,
wizards need to remain seated, meditating on the beauty of melee
backsides until the mob is nearly down to half, but it's far from the
definition of a wizards role as the game progresses.
