I'm ready to take back the box back to Radioshack and ask for my money
back - I could give a shit about their "no opened boxes" return
policy.    

On the box it says 30 day free play.    Well when I create a new
account, I am forced to agreet to pay $12.95USD right away... no
option, no mentioning of anything to do with a free trial.

When I called customer service, I was on hold for 10 minutes (I was
calling long distance)... no indicater saying how long you have to
wait.

I then tried contacting them through their wonderful chat service.
Well, that started at approximately 12:30pm.    Here I am at 1:45pm
and I'm STILL waiting for a reply. 

A suggestion to Sony - for $19 Canadian per month, you can kiss my ass
starting on the left cheek and delicately work your way towards the
right.
