As far as I know Guild wars are already possible in standard EQ. As for the
others, well Vallon and Tallon Zek are both Race based PvP servers, and are
closest to your "Race battles".  Rallos Zek, or Sullon Zek ( not sure
which ) is also a Diety based PvP server, your classic Good Vs Evil with
fence sitting neutrals added in.
