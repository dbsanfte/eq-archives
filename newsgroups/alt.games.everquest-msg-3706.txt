It does sound like one of the "Tiny Glowing Skulls" found on some of
the goblins in Warslik's Woods in Kunark.

I'm still betting that some higher-level player planted it on a newbie
rat just to make life interesting for someone.  The only hitch in that
theory is that you say it "spawned right in front of you", but lag
can often make something "appear" in front of you that had actually been
around for a while, wandering across your path when your client suddenly
got the update on its position, and this can be indistinguishable
from something spawning out of nowhere.
