But it's only another ten levels before he could stand a chance at getting
them.  All in all, I'd agree that it's a no-go right now.  Before Luclin, I
would have suggested Ulthork as a good looking upgrade to Tizmak, but since
they nerfed the velious armor graphichs, I'd say hell no.  Pitty, too.  Half
elves look awful in leather.
