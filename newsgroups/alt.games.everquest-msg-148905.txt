Nonsense. Bits of data in your example directly represent real world 
money, which could be up millions of dollars worth. Bits of data used in 
storing a EQ character take up very little space on a digital media, 
which would probably be in the range of 1-10cents in total cost per 
customer IF that! Is this too much to ask by a customer who has spent 
money on buying the game, buying the expansions and paying a 
subscription fee every month for the entire time they have played the 
game, and who would obviously be intending on returning to pay further 
subscription fees in the future?

Too cheap to pay for a service you are not using? Looks to me VI are the 
ones being cheap here.

In the interest of good customer relations, I think this service 
*should* be free. This is because it is seen as an act of good will, it 
represents customer loyalty and it encourages players to return. It 
makes good business sense and its extremely trivial in cost. After all, 
customer satisfaction is what its all about is it not?

Its a "free" service which will ultimately *benifit* the company in the 
end! Failure to recognise this is simply short sighted.

This is the third case I can think of offhand which I have come across 
posted to this newsgroup.
