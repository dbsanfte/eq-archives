Nope.  I got booted once when it popped up a window, found the option, 
turned it off - and then got booted again 30 seconds later for the exact 
same thing :( Weird.

Also nerve-wracking - I just got booted from EQ and cannot log back on.  
I WAS on Erollisi which is coming down for maintenance at 3am today but 
a) that's a half hour from now and b) there was NO warning whatsoever.  I 
have to REALLY REALLY HOPE that within the time I go LD I don't get 
killed by something, because someone JUST today gifted me with a deluxe 
sewing kit (Why? WHO CARES WHY! *dances*) and I'm only level 5 and hadn't 
gotten back to the Bank'O'Evil to put it away yet.  BAD EQ! BAD! *cries*

( Won't even mention that blackoned iron chestplate, the gloves I can't 
even remember what they are, the Walrus tooth, the plat - oh did I 
mention someone finally got around to twinking me today? ;) )
