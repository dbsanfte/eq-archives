I'll admitt, it is expensive.  Though, some of the stuff out now is good
quality gear.  It's not "if you can get this stuff, you should be wearing
something far better" anymore.  Still, is it too much to ask to allow half
elves to make it?

Granted, I'm only 43, but that's not what I've seen.  So far, a warrior has
about 20% more HP than I do, on average.  Hell, I grouped with a monk two le
vels below me, and finally gave up and let him MT the damn mobs, since his
HP dropped slower than mine.

Normally

Except that Clerics can start raiding as soon as they can handle the fire,
instead of waiting for CH.  You say "broken," I say "overpowered" in that
aspect.  ie... nerfing it won't make the class any more powerful.

> you'd see cleric, shaman, druid, paladin, ranger as a nice clean
descending line

Hmm, problem is, Druids and shamen already have other strengths.  Druids can
nuke, shammies can DoT and debuff like crazy, and paladins can melee.  Given
that, I would think that all three classes should have equal healing.  Also,
druids and shamen can solo quite well.  Pallys can't.

So, it looks like they're going to have to balance things across the board,
not within the archtypes.  If all casters are balanced up to Wizard level,
and all melee is balanced to monk level (or worse, Paladin level), then
melee classes are going to be left behind.  Basically, everyone needs to be
upgraded to Wizard power, and the new encounters (and hopefully the old
ones) need to be upgrades to match.  That way, we get a level playing field,
instead of wizards and the rest of us.

I've noticed that my stuns no longer interrupt casters.

Maybe the problem with paladins, in raids, is perception... much like it was
with mages.  Still, I've seen paladins turned down for warriors quite often
(my guild leader is my roomate's brother-in-law and is also on my ship, so I
get to see things that I can't yet participate in), especially in favor of
Warriors.

I wasn't playing back then, but I'd say they were overfixed.  Especially
with manaburn.

It may be perception, but I rarely see a knight class go as a SA.

That wasn't my concern.  I'm more thinking about grouping or soloing.  I
mean, with their spells and the recent changes... I almost think clerics
out-paladin the pallys.

No, but my concern is that, as the classes improve, the encounters will
become more difficult.  If Pallys lag behind, the we may find ourselves
incapable of dealing with the new worlds.

In other words, Paladins are still near the bottom of the melee curve.
