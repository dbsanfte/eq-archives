Not to get in a shouting match or flame war...

I sincerely wonder what kind of customer services some of these new games
will have when...

1. Most likely loaded with fresh unexplored bugs
2. New customers sevice people
3. unknown customer base (how to plan how many CS people to have and how to
add more to match new member growth)
4. many others when dealing with any new venture.

It seems to me that these new games will be in a chaotic state for some time
to come...possibly even more than Verant :-)

JMHO
