That's one of the easier solo tasks.  Which is not to say it's easy.
My 52 Monk and a 65 Chanter friend were able to handle the spiders
okay, until we got careless and tried to take over a room that a
larger group had recently vacated.  (Their kill rate was faster, of
course, so the respawns came closer together, so we found ourselves
fighting about 4-5 mobs just as the chanter's VOQ, pet haste, and
other buffs ran out.  Of course. :-)

The task should've specified the zone.  You have to click on the task
line in the upper portion of the Task Window, and then it should show
the current state of the task as individual steps.  Each step will
show the required zone (which may be "ALL", e.g. for killing Stillmoon
creatures).

I'm told you may have to be patient and ask the NPCs in the wayfarer's
camp (NOT the gypsy camp; they're up on the hill in Lavastorm) multiple
times before they offer you other tasks.  My 52 monk was getting offered
only a task involving killing Stillmoon creatures, which are much tougher
than mobs in Lavaspinner, while the 65 chanter was given a choice between
that and the easier spider task.  Eventually I managed to get offered a
different task.

We later tried doing a task that required killing drakes in Lavaspinner,
and those are a bit higher level and tend to be casters, not to mention
they like to drift off into the lava stream during the battle.  So I'd
say stick to those spiders for your first task.

The one task we did finish gave us faction, but no "token" to turn in for
more faction.  I gather the tokens come from group tasks, but I'm not
sure where to get those tasks.  (Maybe a non-KOS group member goes in and
gets a task from one of the camps in the tunnels?  Not sure.)
