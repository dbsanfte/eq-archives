As of the latest patch Verant really help us Monks out for a 
plat or 2 any
Mage or Shaman Level 16 and above will summon 
Deminsional Pockets for you Wt
0.1 100 % reduction. You now have 30 minutes to relog on 
after Loging or
going LD before they will dissapear.

A good point.. I guess I need to do this near to an Iksar 
friendly vendor, though.  When I leave town, I usually stay 
away for quite a while, only returning when I really have to.  
So, maybe while I'm on vacation next week (No EQ!!!) I can 
research up some good places to go where the loot is good, 
and there are vendors nearby. 

In the meantime, I'll just keep destroying copper & silver....
