If you have done minimal damage to the mob, you can run across your pet and 
the mob will join the other mob in attacking your pet. Then use /assist 
petname to cast on the same mob that the pet is working on.

I use this tactic when farming HGs. Cast Scars or another low agro spell to 
get the mobs attention and then run back to the other side of my pet. The 
mob stops at the pet. and then I go get another mob.

Just don't try it with more than four mobs on the pet at one time. The fifth 
will chase you.

It works with necro pets, too.

If all else fails, hike up your skirt and run for the border! SoW is your 
friend ;)
