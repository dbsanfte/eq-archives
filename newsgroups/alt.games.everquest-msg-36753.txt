By 32 exp from the mammoths, even solo, is going to be crawling.  I am
currently 26th lvl warrior and have been killing mammoths for about four
levels, grouped when possible, solo with downtime when no one is around.  I
am already thinking of moving on, because the exp isn't great anymore
compared with other places (paw, etc.), but the loot from those mammoths is
still pretty sweet to me (yes 26 is my highest character).  Icy orcs are
still yellow or even cons to me, and have to be single-pulled with harmony
or some such method, and they are often camped, but I hear they are blue
well into the 30s.
