Yep. Not worth to try and petition KSing, they cant/dont do anything 
about it anyway. I found that the best way of dealing with deliberate 
KSing (actually seen a guy in EC shout to the zone that Orc 1 was now 
his since he was higher level and needed the belts), is to write his 
name down, warn friends and guild about him. Nothing more satisfying 
than having the moron need a port the next week, and being able to tell 
him exactly why you wont port him.
