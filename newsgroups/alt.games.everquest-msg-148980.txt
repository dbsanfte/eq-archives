I am a software professional. Nuff said, these are my opinions and I
wont be referring to anything that anyone can't understand. You may
not agree, but I can't help that!

In engineering we take the cost of doing something, and weight it
against the benefits. Most everyone does that, but in engineering we
say its the "engineering tradeoff"

You pay say $15 a month. What does that pay for? Well, off the top,
there is the cost of doing business. That cost is profit. Sony is not
in business for anything else. Lets assume a profit of zero. Lets
pretend Sony is now a non-profit company.

Lets also assume that the marketing cost of operating the Sony website
and all the promotions they do are also free. Lets even say all the
Highest level Managers have decided to put in their time for free. The
only ones not direct production are the HR people and the janitor.

The only two groups we will pay are Customer Service and Software. If
a paid CS representitive has to pay attention to all your petitions
for more than 10 minutes a month, how much does that cost? How about a
half hour? If I assume that a CS professions and his support staff
cost $25 an hour to run (that number is one I use for minimum wage
workers, plus benefits, and overhead)we can make a table:

10 mins ........... $2.50
20 mins ........... $5.00
30 mins ........... $7.50
40 mins ........... $10.00
50 mins ........... $12.50

Not lets see how many petitions that a paid worker handles a month
from one user. If it takes 2 minutes to pick up and alert to the
petition, 5 minutes with the user, 3 minutes to report results, thats
10 minutes. Can a GM do more than 6 an hour? Perhaps they can. I bet
on average they do about 6 because some take longer than others.

I betcha that on a GM only system without guides, we will be looking
at a price increase. There will be no way around it. They may be
trying it on EQ now, to see how the model works. I wonder what happens
when POP comes out...
