Well, another grudge I have about FF XI is the game doesn't belong in
the "main" FF series. I'm an FF fan to be sure, almost to a fault...
But an MMORPG just doesn't fit the main series. I know people that
love the game, though... *shrug* It looks very pretty, I'll give it
that. But, so does L2. I've played that beta. x_x Word of advice:
Don't.

There's always Ragnarok Online if you want something that's a big
break from the usual MMORPGs. It's....cute. >< Gravity, the company
running it, is a bit of a pain in the ass, but I hear they've gotten
better since iRO went live. It's a game that originated in Korea. You
can find some private servers to play on for free, though they're
technically illegal and it's hard to find one that's not totally
"munckin"ed out. I know of a good one, but it's very private and I'd
have to get permission to give info (which would also have to be done
privately)...
