The level 24 default pet is the earth pet, for 99% of my operating life
the worst possible pet; he has more HP but takes more damage than any
other pet, which cancells out, you might think, except that since my
heals are fixed in size, its much better to have a pet with half the HP
total that takes half the damage per minute, my healing mana goes twice
as far.  Add to this the fact that he does the least damage, has no DD
output at all, and spends an inordinate amount of time casting Root
willy nilly.. Root has its tactical uses, but his CC skills suck, and
groups rarely want to use Prox Aggro... his root is really only at all
practical when I'm soloing, and not often then.

The other three pets, I could accept your idea, they all have advantages
and disadvantages, but rarely will a group ever request you get rid of
one and summon a lower level pet of another flavor if you don't have
anything other than your choice... root boy, if they don't say it to
your face I can assure you they are discussing it in tells behind your
back.

Plus, I have only the Water focus so far, so getting the latest version
of the water summon was definately a worthwhile endeavor.
