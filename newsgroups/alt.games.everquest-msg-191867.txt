Actually I looked at that list and a number of the things marked N in
version 6.00 that I am using are there and work as expected. Admittedly
there are still some of the N's that are not there. It quoted this whole
message fine, retained the subject, let me look at the entire address of the
sender, and I was able to tell I was replying to the group and not the
poster (maybe some dumbass can't).
Also note this does not make it a real newsreader, since this is just giving
in the net stamp of approval, it became a newsreader when it read news.
For the go-cart analogy, no it did not become a car, but it did become (wait
for it), transportation. Just like a bicycle.
Kind of like a nascar car is still a car, but even though (the majority)
would not be street legal (kind of like the stamp of approval to drive it
anywhere).
