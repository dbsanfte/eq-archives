I'm a 40 wiz and wondered if anyone knew any fairly decent camps I could do
to try and get some decent items to sell (or use). I don't want to have to
pay for Allakazahm so its hard to look up items by level.
I have tried The Great Oowomp but it seems every third pop he is a super
resister and he beats me down. He is also quite stingy with his drops.
Haddan is almost perma camped on my server and I wondered if anyone knew any
good camps for around my level.

I quit at 39 and gave all my stuff to friends so need to get some cash for
some equipment. I'm bored with porting.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

End
