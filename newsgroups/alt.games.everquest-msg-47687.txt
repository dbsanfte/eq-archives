This was brought up once, and they said "no".  I don't think they gave
a reason.

At least now that you can shift-click to pick up all the coins of a
given type, it is pretty easy to do this manually.  There's still a
lot of clicking, but it's not too bad without the amount dialogs.

Sometimes a player can fix this.  Have an enchanter memblur the NPC,
or have a cleric atone the NPC.  Actually, a friend who was a guide
told me that that is what guides do in this situation (cast the guide
memblur, I mean...they don't go find an enchanter or cleric!).

I'd prefer to see at level 20 and level 50 giving you a chance to
reallocate your discretionary points to fix creation mistakes.

I believe they don't want to do this kind of thing because of server
load.  Remember that a given EQ world is running on a bunch of
computers.  The zone you are in might be running on a separate machine
from the one South Karana is running on, and your zone server would
not have any information about the players in SK, and their system is
not designed to efficiently provide that information.  Thus, only
guides and GMs get those commands.

I do think they make an exception for zones that generally require
raids to enter, such as the planes.  "/whoin fear", for example,
should give you a list of the group leaders of all groups currently in
Fear.

Also, if they are not going to support alt-tab, they should trap it so
that accidently hitting it does not screw you.  Same with the Windows
key.  (They used to treat the Windows key just like any other key...I
used to use it as my autoattack key, in fact).

They've rejected this for /loc, because they don't like /loc.  It was
in beta for reporting bugs, and they forgot to remove it, and then
decided too many people would bitch if they did, so left it.

There are a couple of new slash commands that currently give the
message that they only work in a bazaar zone, so they definitely are
doing something.

Here's one idea how auctions could work.

1. Each player gets 8 lines of auction text they can set.

2. If you give the /viewauctions command, you get a scrollable list,
similar to ranger/druid/bard tracking, that lists all nearby players
who have an auction up, and one line of their auction text.  If the
player has more than one line of auction, the viewauction display
should cycle through all their lines at a rate of one line every few
seconds.  You can sort this list by name or by how long the player has
been in the zone.

3. Clicking on a player in the viewauctions list displays all their
auction lines in your chat window.

4. "/atell message..." sends a message to the last person whose
auction you clicked on.

ShowEQ logs. :-)

It might also make sense to make mob attacks depend on the mob type.
For example, when fighting a wharf rat, the AC on my feet and legs
should be more important than the AC on my head.

(Dark Age of Camelot may be doing something like this.  When a mob
hits you, it does tell you where the mob hit (e.g., feet, torso, head,
etc), but I haven't been able to tell if it uses the armor on that
slot to determine damage, or just overall armor.  They may be just
assigning hits to a spot for wear.  Armor degrades with use in DAoC).
