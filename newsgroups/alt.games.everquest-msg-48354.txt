 I've (we) killed Phin 4 times now, no staff so far. Another Wiz in my 
last guild had to kill him 10 times for the staff. The problem with 
Phin is getting a group to actually take the time to go in. Not many
like the water environment. Add to that the infrequency of the drop...
 
 Venril Sathir was a piece of cake compared to Phin, we walked in, 
buffed and killed him. Got my Gnarled staff first time. Broken Golem
in Fear will just take time and luck, I get offers all the time to go
there.
