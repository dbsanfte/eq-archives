Why not? Surely killing yourself would be an extreme last resort which 
you would only try once all other options are exhausted?

The most rational decision he could make, if indeed EQ was the source of 
his depression, was to stop playing EQ. Suicide is at the bottom of the 
list of choices, below the rational thinking line.

Unless there simply is no other way to end suffering, yes it is always 
the act of an irrational mind. Give me an example where it is not.

Because I would say most people would only consider suicide as an 
extreme last resort after all other options have been exhausted. 
Wouldn't you?

Nope I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare unfortunately.

As I mentioned, when all other options have been exhausted and there is 
simply no other way to avoid suffering then yes, it can be considered 
rational. However, this is far from the case of the kid in question 
(assuming again that EQ is to blame).

Nope, this is entirely different. Asbestos workers who contract 
mesothelioma directly because of their exposure to aspestos and were not 
aware of the possible health hazards should be compensated. Someone who 
becomes so obsessed with a hobby or past time to the point where they 
choose to commit suicide over it by their own free will should not.

Lets choose a more appropriate analogy. A man falls so in love with a 
woman that he cannot bear to be without her. She dumps him. He kills 
himself and his mother sues the woman's family because the woman did not 
warn the man she could be addictive. Rational?

Cigarettes are addictive due to Nicotine, a physical chemical substance. 
EQ is addictive because it is fun. Should every company or individual 
which provides a product or service which could be considered to be fun 
now put a label on it warning it may be addictive?

Legislative.

If all requirements of the legislature are met then the judge decides.
