Oof, wish I had a good suggestion. Maybe instead of pulling with an arrow
you could pull with proximity?  A lot of extra work, but it's one thought
anyhow.  I'd have to agree with the other person, though, that at your
level you don't have much control over losing your own aggro. :(  

I too didn't group my way through those levels though...I duoed with a
shaman, and in that situation I'm supposed to have the aggro. :(
