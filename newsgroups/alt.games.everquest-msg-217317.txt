That can't be right either. I finally got stats out of my stone a couple
days ago, +2 HP/Mana. I have 10 wins in Ruj, 12 in Mir, 1 in Guk and nothing
in Tak or MM. Now if I were to guess, based on that, I'd say its 10 in one
and 3 in ONE other, not all others. I didn't check if I got stats after my
third Mir win(I did the 10 in Ruj first), but I did after I got 10 there and
they showed up.
