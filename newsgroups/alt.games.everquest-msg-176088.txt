Pretty much anywhere with giants (besides velious) or cyclops such as
Ro,  Rathe Mountains, OOT.  Most of those would be 35-50, although you
can now make around 100 pp an hour doing the shopping quest once you hit
35.  Most dungeons have pretty good loot. Lavastorm elementals drop low
end gems starting around 12, but of course at this level wisps offer
better loot. Recondite bandits in paludal from about 15-27 have decent
pp and some pp sellable junk armor and weapons, I made quite a bit here
as the majority of other twinked characters won't bother to take it. 
Also fighting spiders can be very profitable at early levels as tailors
will pay a premium for spider silks.
