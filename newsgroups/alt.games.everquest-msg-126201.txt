Some thoughts on the new user interface screenshots...

The ability to have multiple chat windows is going to be really nice. 
I hate losing tells amidst battle spam.  It appeared as though you
could have multiple chat windows, each with their own filter (which is
very nice as well).  However, there were no screenshots on the page
showing this in action - aside from "Main Chat" and "Chat 1".  The
current /hitsmode feature doesn't work with non battle messages (as
far as I can tell), so this feature is going to be a very welcome
addition.

We will have a slight learning curve adjusting to the new buff and
spell gem icons.  However, I am willing to "unlearn" the old spell
gems and go with the new stuff.  Having to hold the right click on
each buff to figure out what I have is inconvenient and sometimes
harmful.

Doing away with the 640x480 resolution is much appreciated.  The first
few months I played the game, I didn't know about the "same
resolution" feature and it would take a couple of seconds for the
monitor to switch resolutions.  Now, using the "same resolution"
feature, everything becomes tiny and more difficult to read when I'm
in my spellbook - especially when a chat message appears in a color
that doesn't contrast well with that light brown background color. 
Furthermore, I feel naked and vulnerable when staring at my spellbook.
 /sigh I don't know how you all put up with staring at the book to
med.  Seriously.  If I had played the game during that era, I would
have either gone entirely melee, or gone back to starcraft :)

Speaking of the spellbook, did anyone else notice there are now 8
spells per page?  This is incredibly useful!  Even if you are diligent
with the arrangement of your spellbook, you still have to constantly
switch pages to get to that spell you want.  And some casters use a
wider variety of spells, having to constantly unmem/mem spells.  If
only you could create a macro to automate the memming of a particular
set of spells (/em puts mental note on wish list).

On the inventory screenshot, all of our armor placement icons have
been rearranged.  Frankly, I don't care much either way.  However, I
would like to see a screenshot of the "skills" display on this screen.
 There is a screenshot of skills available, but I believe this is for
training with your guildmaster.  If the skills screen is anything like
the shot of training with your guildmaster, I must say kudos to the UI
team!  I would LOVE to have a numerical display of my skills when less
than master.  Sometimes you may put a tradeskill on the backburner and
come back to it way later and not remember where you are at (and not
know which combines will be trivial).  And when working on a
specialization, it is critical to track which one is the one to go
over 50.  Sure, you can change your specialization through questing,
but it would greatly simplify things if you could just prevent that
from happening in the first place directly through the UI.

Having the options placed in a tabbed window is going to be nice.  It
looks like you won't have to press the "next" button 3 times to find
that particular hotkey you want to bind, followed by pressing the
"back" button 3 times to get out.

Pet window.....  What can I say that isn't already obvious?!  No more
macros buttons with 6 letter words to describe the action!  (pATACK,
pGRDME, etc. LOL).  Instant view of your pet's health!  Enchanters no
longer have to click on their pet to determine its health!  Other pet
masters no longer have to ask for a health report!  I assume that
these new pet command buttons can be mapped onto a hotkey through the
normal process.

I noticed there is a "friends" button in the window selector
screenshot.  Is this a /who all friend command?  I wonder if we can
now add more than 30 friends?  Given most of my friends have 4 or more
alts, that leaves room for 7 RL people in my friends list.  Not very
useful IMHO in a *massively* MORPG.

There is also a "help" button on this window selector screen.  I
wonder what this is.  Online help?  Or /help?  An online help manual
describing in more full detail each command would be useful.  With the
current /help normal, you have to scroll back several pages to see all
that is displayed.

Now the only thing left that I want covered is how this new UI will be
delivered to us, the end user.  Will we have to purchase yet another
addon?  Will it be transparent like a patch?

All in all, I must say good job VI.  And yes, yucky poo to the spell
gem shapes.
