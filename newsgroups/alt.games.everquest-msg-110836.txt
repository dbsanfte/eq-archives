Whether this would annoy me or not depends on where I am.  In some zones,
pretty much everyone who spends more than 10 seconds at the zone in is there
to find a pick up group.

Visiting these zones is like visiting a gay disco rather than attending a
society ball.  You see someone you like, you grab his cock...if he doesn't
like you, he says no, and you both move on.  (I think I've been watching too
much "Queer As Folk"...)

Anyway, you zone into, say, OS, you should expect to get your cock
grabbed...er, I mean expect to get invited to groups without a lot of
preliminary chit chat, if any.

On the other hand, getting an invite while running along in DL, or passing
through the Nexus, would be rude and annoying.
