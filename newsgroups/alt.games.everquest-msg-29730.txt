Over the last year, this topic has (obviously) been done to death. And
people with *and* without logs, numbers, etc. to back them up have
pretty much come to the conclusion that a *well formed* group that is
*steadily* pulling blues will generate more xp than any other scenario,
much faster.
  This of course, makes several assumptions:
1. That the group is approriately class/level balanced
2. That everyone is working well and not fucking up and getting you all
killed.
3. That there is a very steady supply of blues to be had, and the puller
knows what he's doing.

If you can get close to all three of those, then any time after the
midlevels, the steady pulling of blues maxes out your xp rate.  If you
throw out any of those factors, then of course, all bets are off and
*any* scenario might net more xp.
