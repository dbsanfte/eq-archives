It is possible that GMs might do something, if, /report was done with 
incriminating information.  Without that, likely nothing will happen 
beyond his reputation being ruined.  I would suggest posting on a Bertox 
specific board, if there is such a thing, as the number of people who 
frequent this newsgroup is rather low now, and the number of them that 
play on Bertox is small.
