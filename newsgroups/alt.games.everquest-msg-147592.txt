That's odd, because long ago there was a patch that allowed
bards to hit magic-only mobs with magic gloves (at that time
netted were the only ones - no wu's).  I would have thought
by now they'd have just fixed it so anyone can.

By long ago I mean a couple months after release, when I was
struggling to get my bard safely into 9 (I went from 9 to 8
and back to 9 again so many times, I started to think it was
how VI got the other name they had tacked on at that point -
989 games :-)
