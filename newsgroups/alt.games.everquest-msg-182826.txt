From the shadows, the mysterious "James Hicks"

Then that goes against my reputation as a healer who can keep you
alive (if that happened). It's still my mana. Not yours. Not the
group's. Mine. As a good player I will put it to the best use I can
think of to help the group. But if a disagreement arises between how I
think it should best be used and someone else, guess what... my
decision wins unless they can convince me why I am wrong, and I do
listen.

I think you should reread that paragraph. What you just said is so
wrong it amounts to an outright lie. I didn't say I refused to buff, I
said I refused to buff when it was considered to be better to use mana
in other ways. That was rarely the case when it was hp buffs, but the
same can't be said about others.

That's right. Sometimes the fastest haste isn't the best.

If I am in a melee heavy group at the levels you would be using
alacrity I could quite easily be wiped nearly dry trying to keep it up
(remember all the other things an enchanter is supposed to do). I take
it you're one of those players not used to having casters without KEI
these days? Some of us still play sometimes without it.

Alacrity: 115 mana per 11 minutes
Auggie: 90 mana per 27 minutes

You do a good job of proving the enchanter is the one who knows which
spell to be casting. As an enchanter I would ignore your whiny tank
when LFG, if this were in game and not a discussion newsgroup. :-)
Then I would proceed to outlevel you by a factor of two to one as your
new enchanter and healer waste their mana trying to keep unnecessary
buffs up, causing downtime, while we keep pulling.

It's happened before. :-)

Obviously as I said if it were just one tank I would stick with
alacrity, and sometimes two depending on other drains, but three
melee? Four? They get augmentation.

Btw, I am always getting compliments on my play as enchanter, so I'll
stick to my guns here as well as there. A big part of that is knowing
how to best use the mana I have. As the enchanter of the group,
downtime depends pretty much entirely on my mana and the healer's
mana, and I don't often have downtime with the way I play.

I would say why, of course. They have to have the opportunity to prove
me wrong.

They never do, though. :-p

And it is my decision.
