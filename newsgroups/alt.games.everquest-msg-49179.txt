www.pumapaw.com

Search around in there, you'll find a whole lot of furry art.  Some
are digitigrade (which I agree, they should properly be done), most
are plantigrade.  You'll also find a few with multiple breasts.

WARNING:  Some of the art is *definitely* adult-oriented.

Note:  Assuming that an anthropomorphic cat were to evolve, the
reduction from 6 to 2 mammaries and the relocation of the mammaries up
the torso both make sense.

First, in an upright position, offspring cannot be fed unless they are
supported by the parent's arm(s), or are able to find purchase
themselves.  Given multiple mammaries, they would have to be *very*
small offspring in order for each to find a place to hold on.  Ergo,
fewer offspring (only one or two) to a litter, and a concomitant
reduction in number of mammaries.

Second, in an upright position, mammaries down near the bottom of the
torso are more vulnerable, as are the offspring feeding from them, and
the mother's arms cannot be used to support injured / tired offspring.
Those with lower mammaries would tend to have more trouble feeding
their offspring, and have both their mammaries and their offspring
more often injured.  Survivors would be those with mammaries higher on
the torso, who would then pass that modification along to their
decendants.
