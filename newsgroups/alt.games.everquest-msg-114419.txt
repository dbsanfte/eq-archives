Guild leadership. If loot policy is important to you, make sure you
know if before you join a guild. If they do callout loot, make sure
that the person who does callout is someone whose sense of fairness
you trust. If you can't live with callout or don't consider it fair,
don't join a guild that uses it.

IMCNVHO, random loot sucks. It's the least efficient way to hand out
loot, has zero relation to who helped get the guild to the point where
it could get the loot or on that particular raid. Short of
deliberately handing loot to the people who can make the least use of
it on guild raids, it takes longer than any other method to get a
guild to the next level of raid effectiveness so that *everyone* can
get better loot.

My guild has always done callout and it has served us well, albeit
with some spirited discussions on the subject. But, I suspect that we
will keep doing it that way until we're ready to move to DKPs.
