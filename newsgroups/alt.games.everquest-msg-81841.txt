Well, you -would- know that the site was down when I tried it!! It said
something about being down for 2 hours... I'll try it before I go to bed :)
And even before I see it, I /kneel and say "thank you!" I just saw the movie
again tonight... oh god, I hate to say this... for the 13th time (cringe).
Well, it was the last night for it to be in our little town, and I really
can't get enough of Legolas frowning, throwing down that arrow and saying
"Orcs!" ;) Nah, actually, I just like his legs and butt :) Oh! I also got
the manager (apparently since I've been such a good customer lately!) to
give me the card that they stick in their little ticket window. He also let
me in for free ;) All in all, not a bad night.

thanks, will check this out as soon as the site is up again!
