I apologize for any misunderstanding, however, I am using the
alt.games.everquest newsgroups to post, and not a chat room.  This is not a
sore subject to all, and I am simply presenting a service for those that are
interested.  Those that are not interested are not forced to view this post.

Again, for those interested, the link is WTS-Auctions . com.
