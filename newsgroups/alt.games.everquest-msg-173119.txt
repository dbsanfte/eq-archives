The reply to the OP and the website listed above are the biggest bunch 
of manure I have read.

Let's just assume that what was written is true. By that you think that 
the men and women of our armed forces do not deserve to be thought of as 
they go overseas?

And what "political" and "economic gain" are they going over there for? 
If by that your assumption is that we are going to war only for oil 
protection, you might want to check into how much oil we actually import 
from the Middle East. The majority of the U.S. oil stocks come from 
Canada, and Mexico.

If you people hate the US so much, then please leave, and spare us your 
mindless drival!
