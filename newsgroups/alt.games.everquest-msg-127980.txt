Well, there's always exceptions. But for the most part, other than
Google unless you are *deleting* threads (which you are) they may show
up as active but not as *new*, which means one has already read the
thread anyways, or didn't. Nothing has changed in the thread, so why
would it remaining active count as more advertisements? You've already
read the original post....
