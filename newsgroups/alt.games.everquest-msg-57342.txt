Not a ranger, but:

Don't get aggro.  Use a big slow two hander if you have to.  You can't
take a beating, don't try.  Once you get Jolt, you'll be able to play
the same game Rogues do, losing aggro if you get it, then things won't
be so miserable for you.

Best way to not get aggro is to stick to fear kites, where you only
have to worry about it while the fear is worn off.  Keep the mob
snared, and kite it around while someone gets fear back on it.
