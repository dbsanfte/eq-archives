Keep trying it then.

Beg has a few possible outcomes.

Success - recieve one copper to one silver. (if they have the money to give)
Failure - NPC tells you to get lost
Critical Failure - NPC attacks you.

chump change nor the additional "roleplaying entertainment" of mashing a
button was worth the half hours invested in corpse recovery and regaining
experience.
