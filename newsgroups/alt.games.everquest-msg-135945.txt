I'll not argue your point.  My first character, created in July
1999, was a Paladin, deleted at L4 and replaced by another Paladin
(Kaev).  So I've been through the whole mess of upgrades to hybrids
in particular and melee (esp. 2-handers) in general.  I remember
getting my first decent 2-hander at L17 and finally being able to
outdamage Clerics in melee (a weapon that by today's standards is
so poor that nobody does the quest anymore).  But, as pathetic as
knights used to be (SK's were just as bad in melee and their spells
were stealth gimped besides, poor guys), we've been able to produce
more melee damage than casters from L20 (Double Attack) and on up
all along.
