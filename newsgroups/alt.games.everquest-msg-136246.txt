}Not quite, actually, not to be too nit-picky (since *you* seem to be

}EQ was deliberately acting in a way that would result in personal
}attacks, and thus satisfy his need to be a victim.

Yeap, I knew I was going out on a limb a little.  There's only so much 
being said in a statement like 'to match your victim mentality'.  But  
figured my guess couldn't possibly be as far off-base as EQ's. :)  Sounds 
like I was actually pretty close. :)

}Just wanted to clarify.  Not fault of yours if the meaning was
}unclear, this thread has not exactly followed a logical flow of
}conversation!

No problem, clarification appreciated.
