I gave him something out of curiosity and thought it was quite funny
having him follow me around though he wouldn't get on the boat.
Thought it might be interesting to kill him just to see what treasure
he had accumulated, but didn't want to see what sort of faction hits I
would take or if he'd agro the whole dock area so I passed.
