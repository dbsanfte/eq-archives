Oh, puh-leaze.

Names are about the least important thing when it comes
to roleplaying.

If anything, I find the player-chosen "Indian-style" names
(e.g. "Orcsmacker Trueheart", or what have you) to put me
much more in an RP mood than, say, "Avaeloene".

And as for the random name generator, I hate the names it
comes up with -- personally, I'd rather *NOT* have everyone's
name sound like someone yodeling while gargling.  Plus, they
sound so much alike that it's really hard to tell anyone
apart from each other.

One need only consider that the pinnacle of RP fiction,
"Lord of the Rings", contains many names that would be
"illegal" under the Everquest naming rules ("Gandalf the Gray",
"Merry", "Pippin", "Farmer Maggot", "Rose Cotton",
"Strider", etc.)
