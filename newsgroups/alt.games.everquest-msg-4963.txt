Neriak:

Buy a BIG pile of red wines from any tavern.

Get an invis-casting friend, or a bard, to invis you (AND COME WITH
YOU) as you head into Neriak third gate.  Go into the library,
first room on the left.  You'll find a lone guy standing there.

Hand him 4 stacks of 4 read wines (16 total).  This will break your
invis, but he's so low-level that if you're not a lowbie, he
won't dare attack you even if you're KoS to him.  Now have your
friend cast invis on you AGAIN, before you actually hit the "Give"
button.   You'll be Indifferent again.  Now hit "Give".  That
gives you 16 faction increases with DarkBargainers (Neriak merchants),
DreadGuardsInner, and DreadGuardsOuter.

If your friend is a bard, just have him/her continuously sing
the invis song, which will re-invis you automatically each time
you break invis, once every tick (six seconds).

Repeat many times.

It won't be long before the DarkBargainers love you, and you won't
need the invis assist any more to do the quest (but you will need
it to get in and out of Neriak until the guards stop hating you,
which takes longer).

Note:  The IndigoBrotherhood (Neriak warriors) will still hate
your guts no matter what, so watch your step.  But you can
eventually get in good with the Neriak merchants and regular
guards by doing the red wine quest enough times.
