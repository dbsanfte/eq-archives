Unreal Tournament and (I think) Quake 3 do that if you have an URL like
UT://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx or Q3://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

Half-Life has a registry "hack" that allows you to use HL://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
and they connect you to the game on that server, not sure if those are the
right shortcuts, but the format is the same
