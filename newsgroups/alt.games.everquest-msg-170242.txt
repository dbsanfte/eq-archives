why exactly are you interested in the trophy?

trophies never trivial.  in fact, their trivial point is _well_ beyond the
hard cap of the skill (talk to the people who fail 7x before successfully
combining).  each attempt costs upwards of 3k _just_ for the raw materials,
assuming you can find all of them on vendors (2200 for the 8 velium bars,
520 for the 4 rubies for the purified mana, 263pp for the blue diamond, 210
for the diamond, 187 for the jacinth, 100something for the black sapphire),
and then there's the inevitable donations you'll need to make to have the
gems mounted by a jewelcrafter, a 49+ enchanter to cast the mana vial, and
finally a grandmaster potter to create your artisan's seal (because really,
would you want to give all that stuff to a potter who wasn't at least 200?)

this is all after you have carpal tunnel (and depending on which skill you
raised, a nice case of dementia) from raising your tradeskill to somewhere
in the neighborhood of 250.

by the time it's all said and done, you could've lvl'd up, hunted down a +10
INT/WIS/STR range slot item, and gathered enough plat to buy a tink bag or
two.

and once you have your trophy, and your skill, chances are the market on
your server for that skill is completely saturated anyway.  it's taken my
jewelcrafter over 3 months to make back the money required to get his skill
to 250.

trophies are a nice side effect of getting a skill to 250.  they shouldn't
be a reason to get that skill there.

Meerina Spawndancer
49 Ranger of Tunare
162 Master Brewer with geerlok (probably won't pursue the trophy.  easier to
just buy tink bags and they aren't lore)

Mystarr
41 Enchanter
250 Jewelcrafter with trophy (hard to beat +50 CHA and +10 INT on a range
item for an enchanter ;)

Amalena
37 Druid of Tunare
250 Grandmaster Baker with geerlok (really no reason to pursue the trophy)
