I've only been to Plane of Air once, but I do remember that there are
two planet-like objects visible in the sky.

One looks like a NASA Voyager image of Saturn.  I guess this is supposed
to be Luclin because Luclin has rings.

The other body also looks like a NASA image to me, but I'm not sure
exactly which.  Looks like maybe a moon of Jupiter.  Not sure if this
is supposed to be Norrath or Drinal.

Here's a screenshot of the Saturn-like object:
