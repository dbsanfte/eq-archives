I believe it was 'The Real Folk Blues, Part 1'.  I didn't know any of the
characters, though it was pretty obvious that there was a storyline that
occurred before the start of this particular show.  I've since seen
'Asteroid Blues' (which I liked quite a bit) and 'Stray Dog Strut' (let's
just say Hakim wasn't the most intense antagonist I've ever seen).
Hopefully will get a chance to catch 'Honky Tonk Women' and maybe 'Gateway
Shuffle' tonight once the kids get to sleep. :-)
