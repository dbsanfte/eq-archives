<Shrug> It's the -same- reaction you'd see just like when they were
sub-10... the new system just sort of prolongs the inevitable, and I see no
problem with it.

When I was a newbie (on my Human SK) all I did was stay around FreePort for
a long time because I didn't want to lose everything I worked for. If I
would have respawned with all of my possessions I certainly have traveled
more and explored much of Faydwer (despite my uber-KOS state.)
