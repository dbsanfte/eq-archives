Well, best to give the test team the benefit of the doubt. I'm just a little

ticked that the test team was so clearly forced to let the Umbra engine
be released (or rather, let it escape) before it was ready, or at least before
some sort of performance based auto-switcher (umbra-on, umbra off) was included.
Plus, given the lack of progress on Umbra since release, it's possible that
there is a personnel issue of some sort.
