Yes, and it's why DT and Lokari are wrong.  Good and evil are human
notions and as such are what the majority of human society *says* they
are.  What *you* think while you perform the evil act is immaterial if
the consensus of society is that you are wrong.  Else even a Jeffrey
Dahlmer might have walked free.  There would be no murder convictions,
since all the accused would have to say is, "Well, *I* thought it was
a good idea."

Part of the problem with this discussion is that we are trying to lump
far too many disparate things into some all-encompassing definition of
evil.

Those terribly misguided young men on Sept. 11 cannot be called evil
(by my definition, at any rate) since they were performing a supremely
*selfless* act.

As to bin Laden, well, in my own (grossly uninformed) opinion, yes, he
is doing evil.  He is "pulling a Hitler," if you like :)  Trying to
escape the ramifications of his extreme self-involvement by
identifying it with something marginally larger.  But furthering the
prospects of Islam or Aryans at the expense of the rest of the world
communtiy is something the world community will object to, rather
strenuously.  Further, tolerance of others believing differently than
yo do is something that I think the *majority* of the world's
population will agree is a good thing.

Precisely my point.

I see it as a big thing too.  The worst thing there is.  That doesn't
mean it can't be understood.

I'm saying that what we think of as healthy self-interest, while
probably necessary to the functioning of a healthy society, is the
first step on the road to depravity.  As long as you don't take too
many further steps down that road, you're fine.  We are none of us
saints.

Yes.  C.S. Lewis, I believe.
