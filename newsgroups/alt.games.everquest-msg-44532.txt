The idea is that with a 30% exp bonus, killing two mobs in the Hole is
the same as killing three mobs of that level elsewhere.  53+ still fits in
your "low 50s" range, and yes, that's what I've seen, no 56+ doing the
entry area to speak of.  Once you get past the ledge in there you do
indeed need to see your group working like a well oiled gnome tinker.

Howling  Stones = Chardok, unless that Fizzlecutter 500 I've been
drinking is a powerful hallucinogen.

-Self employed,
You know the saying about lawyers, a man who'd defend himself in
court has a fool for a client?
I'm wondering if the same could be said for a man who works for himself
having an idiot for an employee.
