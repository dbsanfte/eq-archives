There is never a guarantee that other players will share a spawn in a
cooperative manner.  If you are waiting for a spawn and another group moves
in to wait for the same spawn, be prepared to unload as much damage as
possible regardless of what the other group says.

That way, if they are truely going to play nice and give you first crack at
the spawn, then no problem.  However, if they attempt to jump on the spawn,
you'll still have a good chance of getting it.  In any outcome, I would be
VERY hesitant to get a Guide or GM involved in ANY situation.  I've found
the Guides and GMs (in my few dealings with them) to be little more than
children themselves, lacking conventional wisdom and common sense.

This used to be a common problem, but I honestly have not seen too much of
this sort of thing happening anymore.
