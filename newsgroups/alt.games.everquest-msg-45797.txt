Thanks. :-)
After a rough weekend, I needed a good smile. That was funny.
By the way, has anyone done a /who all survey on FV yet to see the class
breakdown? From the ruleset posted, I was guessing that it's going to be
about 40% druids, 40% necros, and 20% their second characters on their
other account/computer. Just wondering if it was panning out
differently.
