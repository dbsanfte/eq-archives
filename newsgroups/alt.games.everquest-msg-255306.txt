Still don't have 1.

The keys werent actually THAT bad though... its the first time i've been in
about a year or 2, i.e prior to the revamp.. once I became aware of the
ground spawns we flew through most of the other wings.   Only the named for
access to the final wing was a real pain in the ass.  He alone was about
1hour, if not more.. I lost count of the number of times we trained the
whole wing on ourselves while waiting for the named to show up.

In the final wing, we couldn't go past the door behind drus (to the portal),
but everything else was killable.. basically just kept doing a big loop from
the trap, through the centre room, to the golems, then back to the end
room/corridor, and back at the trap.

I would of just levid to the final wing, but when we started it was camped
:(  Id definately recomend people do that, if they lack the master key.
