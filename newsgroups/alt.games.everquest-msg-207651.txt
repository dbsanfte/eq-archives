If the only change is your connection to the Internet, and lag has
increased, then a new video card will do nothing for you.

Best "bang for the buck" and the most compatible is a GeForce 4 Ti4200
(with 64 or 128mb). Any brand will do, unless you plan to OC the video
card. Also dropping in another 512mb of RAM will make a significant
difference as well (unless you have Win98 which is touchy about ram
over 512).
