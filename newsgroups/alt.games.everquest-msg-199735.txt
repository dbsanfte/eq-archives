It took more time, is all.

I forget which US admiral in WWII described sea duty in wartime as 'six
months of boredom followed by an hour of screaming terror.'  Daniel Gallery,
perhaps?  But it describes a KEI-less wizard's soloing life pretty well.  I
leveled up to 58 before KEI or AAs.  I developed a love of music, read most
of the Wheel of Time series, and helped rewrite the guild charter, lotto
rules, and epic rules.  Luckily, a friend of mine gifted me with his account
when he stopped playing, and I grouped in his bard on perma-manasong.
