If I open my inventory and press the "Skills" button, nothing happens. I use
the default EQ UI and have changed nothing in my system when it suddenly
stopped working. What I've culled from prior messages is that there was a
bug that was introduced with the Discord server's release. I first noticed
this problem with my character on Discord, but now it's also affecting my
main on FV.

The apparent problem is that the xPos, yPos, width and height are all set to
0, so the window is opening, it's just not visible. I tried the suggestion
in this NG to manually edit the UI_mycharacter file to reset the values of
this window to something arbitrary that would at least make the window
visible, then save and re-launch EQ, and it sort of worked. What that one
little change did was completely reset ALL of my UI, so that it looked
exactly as though I were just starting EQ for the first time with all of the
windows popping up in the wrong place, Tips on screen, etc, lost all my
macros and hand-crafted socials. All that was preserved was my spellgems.

Well the bug is back and I can no longer open my skills window on my main (I
don't play on Discord anymore). I'm really not eager to reset my UI again,
is anyone aware of a better workaround that addresses this bug without
causing a complete reset? Or is there some other way of accomplishing the
ini file edit without causing this effect?
