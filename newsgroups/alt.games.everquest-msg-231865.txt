Everyone places a different value on their time and effort.  Saying that an
item's sale price should be based on the sellers time and effort misses the
other half of the equation.  The buyer may have a different value on his own
time and effort and that has to be considered.  Then if there are 2 buyers
and 1 item, then the one willing to pay more gets the item.  That's just
fair.  Then the other guy can go hunt it himself as he obviously considers
that his own time and effort are not worth that much.
