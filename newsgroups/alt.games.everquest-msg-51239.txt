While it is true that 60 is still the max level, there is supposed to be
some added things that you can spend xp on instead of levelling.  Basically,
as I understand it, you switch to a different advancement mode, then you xp
goes towards that instead of levelling.  I believe that the plan is for
anyone over level 50 to be able to do that.
