I run 2 accounts on one computer with ease (P4 3.2ghz, 1gb ram, ati radeon
9800 pro 256mb) The key is the HDD get a 10k rpm drive, that will improve
your game quite a lot. I'm really just confirming what everybody else has
said here: turn off all the extras, turn down the resolution and graphics
quality to low and you should be fine.

I have noticed the character on auto-follow appears to be lagging our and
getting behind when in fact it's just my local client getting only
background attention from the video card. But travelling its only a small
portion of EQ play anyway.

I would recommend getting the largest monitor you can, and running the
windows resolution as high as you can. I have a 19" monitor and the
resolution is 1600x1200, and I run my EQ's as 800x600 so the screen in the
back only has a tiny amount covered. I don't use eqwindows, but that's
because I don't know where to get it, I just use the release mouse cursor
command.

Tip: hotbuttons are your best friend, and I don't just mean the hotbutton
window. Eliminating key presses is essential to efficiency. For example my
spell gems 1-7 now can be triggered by Q W E R T Y U, each letter
corresponding to a spell gem (I still use alt 8, because I use "I" for
inventory and that would really confuse me). Downside: R got moved to F, I
get that mixed up all the time so be careful what you put in slot 4.

One last tip: I would recommend having a cleric on the 2nd account, and just
play your main character as usual, stopping back to the cleric for
occasional heals, whatever the situation requires. My main is a beastlord
and my cleric just runs along behind virtuing, and healing, and the
occasional clicking (yes I'm not perfect I eat it from time to time).

Ok, I hpe this helps a bit at least.
