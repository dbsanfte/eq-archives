I do most of my newgroup interaction thru google. They have NO means
(that i can find) to filter out the garbage that we are hip deep in
now (thanks to a certain ass). I cant access my news server from work
(have to be on the cox network unfortunately) so im stuck with web
based solutions. Is there another site/service I can use that CAN
filter out the bullsh*t? I enjoy reading and posting, but am so sick
of that idiots nonsense.
