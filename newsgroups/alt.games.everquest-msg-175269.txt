Yeah, dat's what I said.  (I should read whole threads before posting
something that's been said twice already :) )

Really, folks, learn to read instructions.  It might save your life one day,
like knowing which pedal in your car makes the car stop.  IIRC there was an
MOTD that tells you all that stuff.  If you're in WinXP... *don't* hit
Ctrl+Alt+Del.  Don't turn off your computer.  Don't take a baseball bat to
your monitor.  Well, you *can* do all those things if you really want to but
you don't have to to run EQ in windowed mode.  Read the damn instructions.
