Not really much different from attunable in practice though. The only 
people worth buying from are the people actually farming the items.

Precisely. Why would item decay hit casual players harder? If you whack 
mobs 100 hours a week it will wear out faster than if you whack mobs 1 
hour a week. The powergameres will wear out weapons much faster, and be 
able to replace them much faster. Casual gamers will wear out and 
replace items at a scale directly proportional to how much they play.
