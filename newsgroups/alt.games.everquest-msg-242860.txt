Yeah, that was the really bad one.  You are lucky, you at least had the 
chance to forage the Gunthak Water, us nonforaging race shaman are 
screwed.  To get mine, I went with a 65 paladin, and a 65 cleric.  
Paladin pulled half of the fort in the cave in Gunthak to the cleric, 
cleric AoEed them to death.  Loot all the corpses, and got 1 or 2.  
Cleric needed the drop too, so, we did it a second time.  For the other 
drops, I went in and killed many many Lugald Abominations until I finally 
got that drop, then got the Initiate drop off my first or second kill, 
once I figured out which part of the zone the correct Initiates were in.  
Hint, they are not the ones that are green to you.  The last drop was not 
too bad as I recall, off the Black Skulls I think?

For my other spell, I had to clear the whole row of houses leading to the 
docks 6 or 7 times, including many kills of the mob needed, until he 
finally gave me the drop I needed.
