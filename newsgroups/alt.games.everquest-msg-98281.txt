You've been playing from Phase 3 of Beta, BFD.  Just because you've been doing 
something a long time doesn't make you good at it.  Name all the places you take 
your low-mid level characters.

Did you see the URL I included.  It's still there.  Why don't you check that 
out, figure out which of the appropriate zones you haven't experienced, go 
experience them, and then get back to me.

At this point I am forced to conclude that you didn't read my message, you don't 
play the game, you're an idiot, or you're a troll.  Have you ever even hunted in 
a low-mid level dungeon?  They drop some very nice gear for the appropriate 
level characters.  Hell, before mudflation some of them were dropping gear that 
was pretty damn uber for the level.  I mentioned Trivial Loot Code, loot only 
dropped if you were of the level to get exp from the mobs.  The players hated 
it.

Ok, now you can just go in the corner and hold your breath until you turn blue.  
I am a high level player, but I spent a SHITLOAD of time as a low and midlevel 
player.  I didn't hit 50 until well AFTER 50 days /played, so I know what the 
midlevel game is like.  Of the three expansions, two of them added at LEAST as 
much content as existed in the original game.  Using the link I have given you, 
there were 30 zones with some mobs appropriate for levels 15-35 on release.  The 
expansions have added another 20 or so zones, plus the re-tooling of original 
zones, plus the fact that expansion zones are MUCH larger on average then the 
orignal zones.  Not only that, but the mob density on these new zones is MUCH, 
MUCH greater than in original zones.  So how many of those 50 zones have you 
hunted in?

There are MORE players 50-60 than ANY other 10 level range in the game.  
Significantly more.  They are also the players who, as a group, play the most.  
Of course Verant is going to concentrate on them.  Until you demonstrate that 
you've explored even 50% of the possible zones that are level appropriate, 
you're just another whiner.
