Again, you ignore what proves your position wrong. They have said *time
and time again* that hacks and exploits are wrong and that they are
bannable offenses. People *have* been banned for them in large numbers.
The mere fact that you claim they never voiced that pretty much
discredits you. It's pretty common knowledge.

I don't see how one is any better than the other.

That's like saying if someone steals money out of someone else's office 
desk drawer, it's the victim's fault for not locking it up while the 
thief bears no responsibility. Just because it *can* be done, doesn't 
mean it *should*.
