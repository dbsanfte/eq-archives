We were in the midst of recovering from a total wipeout in HoT.  Me and two
others were sitting near the center of the hub, waiting for when the other
guild in HoT to say when it was safe to open the door.  All three of us have
good CoV faction, and so were being ignored by the various scary things that
wander around the hub.

Suddenly, we simply get a message "Soandso died", and one of the three of us
keels over.  There were no unusual messages before that.  The was nothing on
Soandso's screen to indicate what had happened, either.

Anyone seen this before?  Any idea what it was?  This was not just after a
fight, where Soandso could have been hit with a DOT and not noticed it.  It
was in the middle of a long corpse recovery, where we had all been waiting
for a while.  Also, his health was at full just before he died.  I don't
think there is any DOT that will take a level 60 buffed Cleric from full
health to dead so fast that two people standing next to him won't see his
hitpoint bar going down.

I guess it was just not our night.  We had one Enchanter on the raid, and
her corpse got bugged in such a way that after she got her res, she could
not loot.  The looting window came up empty.  So, we waited a while for a
petition, and then someone got the idea of asking the chat GM, and he
suggested turing off the new UI to loot.  That worked.  By then, after a
long corpse recovery (we tried some things that didn't work, before giving
up and summoning), we'd been there 4 hours, and killed exactly *one* mob,
and it was getting late for some people, so we left.  (However, about 10 of
us went to Skyfire and started slaughtering things.  Within an hour or so,
we got the fourth shard for one of our Clerics, and the first shard for
another, so the night ended well :-)).
