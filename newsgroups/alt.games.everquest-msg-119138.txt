Try Rathe Mountains,

People just dont seem to care when you've snared a mob, got it down a fair
chunk and it's obvious it's your's. The lure of c50pp makes people greedy
real quick.

My druid has been stocking up on the pp to help a Guildie out with some
cashflow problems he's been having and this 52 BST just wouldn't stop
stealing my Giants, I about laughed my arse off 10 minutes later when 3
popped on her and she started screaming to the zone for people to take some
off her.
