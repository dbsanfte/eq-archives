it depends on where you go; some dispells are single, others double, others
up to 4 buffs, and i'm sure it goes on and on

the shrunken goblin skull earring is popular, though it's the longest camp
i've ever done ...it's usually a few kpp if you dont have the patience

the bracer of hidden can be a long camp ....can possibly be cheaper than
gobby earring though, on most servers.....i looted one in LoIO...that's
probably a very long camp

both work indoors and are all/all, and are the common setup for avoiding
dispells


be prepared to lose all your buffs anyhow =)
