Ok, after a couple of years of Xbox and my deepest online experience
being Halo 2, I'm ready to get back into EQ1.  I've been out of EQ1
for so long that I don't know if I'll know what to do.

I have Kunark, Velious, Luclin, PoP and LoY... I plan on getting LDoN
(maybe upgrade to the others later).  Here are my questions:

1. What are the "prime" zones for a level 52 druid?  I usually soloed
with him (most recently in Cobalt Scar), but would like a good zone
for pickup groups if there is one.  He's not very well equipped, but
then, he's a druid :)  Is there a better solo zone for him these days?

2. The other char I'm interested in playing is a 40 chanter.  Is it
all but hopeless for him to find good groups these days?  If not,
where should I try to find them?  Is LDoN good for him?

3. What's the population like on Lanys T'Vyl these days?  Pleasantly
underpopulated?  Barren wasteland?  Is it a likely candidate for a
merger?

Thanks for the pointers... I know this group used to get flooded with
"where do I hunt?" questions; but since it's so quiet here I hope no
one minds.
