Thats a very... colourful.. way of describing what happened. Bizbee
repeatedly "threatened" (like in what way is it a threat, other than
the possible loss of a small amount of anonymity against the whackos
out there, of whom Bizbee is included) to post my address and phone
number.

Sick of this "threat", I called his bluff and told him to post it on
condition that he accept full responsibility for anything which
resulted. He posted it. At the very least, it would shut up his
incessant bleating. Or so I thought.

He then *continued*  to "threaten" to post it!

What a fucked up little man he is. And yes, I mean little in every
sense of the word.
