No that's 3rd Dawn. The Dawn I'm referring to was a 'project' by 
glitchless. (I wouldn't bother visiting the site you won't find a breath 
of a word about the Dawn project on it, and amongst other things it 
redirects you to this delightful page if you happen to not be using 
Internet Explorer.

http://www.glitchless.com/notie.html

Now that's good PR :)

If you want to read about Dawn, try googling Dawn & glitchless. The game 
is actually considered by many not even to be vapourware, but an 
outright hoax.

I suppose you could start a development corp with some seed money from a 
major development corp to get it started. If it blows up the dev co 
folds and disappears, and there is nobody left to sue, and nobody 
remembers it a month later. If its going to succeed then the major corp 
buys the 'startup' and plasters its brand name all over the place. We've 
never seen that happen before right? :)

I truly despise our systems of conducting business.

Perhaps they are just not very good at it then. :p

Quite likely. Now.

What about tomorrow. Customer expectations have shifted a long way 
already... give them time. Once upon a time I wouldn't have beleived 
people would plunk down 20,000 deposits to buy Condo's on an empty lot 
from a company that was formed two weeks ago...
