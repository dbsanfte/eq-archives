On the other hand, if you bind where you are fighting, then
the necro can look around (sense undead) for the nearest
chip source, Kill it (root dot if there's no room for fear kite)
get chip, and be at 90% effectiveness.

If your mage can go into town to buy rocks, then he could
just as easily hit the bank... that being the case I'd say
Monk most effective class since I'll assume he has a decent
backup set of armor and equipment there.

On the other hand the OP said gearless.  To me gearless
is what happens when you die and want to go get your
body, other than the test server wipe or moving from
one server to another I can't think of any other reason
you'd be gearless.
