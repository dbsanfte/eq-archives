Huh? Raiding has been going strong in EQ2 for some time. My guild held its 
first raid in November of last year and we've had regular raiding events 
ever since. We raided Bloodskull Valley last weekend, Cauldron Hollow the 
weekend before, and will probably have two raids this weekend (Cove of Decay 
and probably Daughters of Lucan). And we're just one small guild out of 
hundreds on this one server.
