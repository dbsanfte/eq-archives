I think in many ways, the welfare system itself creates the problem.  Take a
man with two kids and a menial job.  He gets laid off because his company
goes under, and starts collecting a check while he takes inventory and looks
for a new job.  Problem is, he may quickly find that he can't afford to lose
the government benefits by working.  Now, he's in a situation where he can
go to work and take a paycut, or stay on welfare and provide for his family.

That goes even farther when you consider a single mother who also has to
face the fact that her welfare goes down (or away entirely) if she marries.

The real tragedy, however, is when the children have grown up in a
welfare-provided home.  They have been raised on an attitude of victimology
and entitlement.  It takes a strong person to cast that aside and become a
useful member of society, it's all they've known.

Even if someone believes that welfare is a good idea in theory, they must
agree that the current system is destructive to the nation and to the
recipient.  We need to impliment a system where welfare only acts to raise
_working_ families above a certain level, and decays as the family income
rises (say, .50$ for every $1 increase in monthly pay, that way they do get
the benefit of the raise, while still being slowly taken off the dole).
This would help to support the poor family, while still allowing them the
sense of purpose and self that comes with being a useful member of society.
