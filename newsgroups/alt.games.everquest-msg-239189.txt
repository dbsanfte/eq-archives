Actually, the bug was that the mob wasn't recognizing that the right class
was getting the killshot.  On the mobs that rogues were supposed to kill,
the mob kept respawning over and over again.  Ditto the ranger-killable
mobs.  We repeatedly got the right class to get the kill shot and the mob
stubbornly respawned.

We tried again last night, after the patch, and it worked flawlessly.  When
the right class got the killshot, the mob died and stayed dead.  We finally
beat the third Ikkiniz trial and will try the fourth tonight.

Well, I never hunted in either of those last three places.  =)  Still you
could bind relatively close to each of those zones and at least get to the
zone-in without too much difficulty.  With GoD, the closest you can bind is
Nedaria, then you have to find a way to invis yourself (I keep a corpse with
invis potions in Natimbi) and run all the way back, risking see-invis mobs
that will kill you instantly.  *That's* the non-fun part.  If only you could
bind in certain places, like maybe at the Kod'taz stone or by the sewers.
That would make CR's a heck of a lot easier, at about par with how CR's were
in VT - for there, I could bind at the zone-in of Umbral Planes and hug the
wall before making a DA dash for the zone-in to VT.

The gauntlet you have to run, and the amount of time it takes to run it,
makes CR's an unnecessarily long chore.  Two-hour-long CR's have become a
reality again.  Some people may consider this a fun challenge; I do not.  I
like challenging things, and I like things that present an obstacle because
it feels great when you overcome them.  But making CR's so painful is plain
old not fun.  It makes a lot of people upset and angry.  I can't tell you
the number of times that clerics have said into the cleric channel, "I hate
GoD".  They always say that during a CR, because guess-who has to make the
long run back in order to rez everyone else.

Others may disagree, and think that adding the challenge back to CR's is a
good thing. I just don't like it, and don't think it's fun.  And I'm far
from alone in that sentiment.  =)

Er, the mob still had hitpoints when the cleric ran out of mana?

You > Me.  =)

Can't explain it, other than to say you have better DPS than we had.  I have
subsequently done this trial again, again with two clerics spamming heals,
but this time the mob died quickly and easily.  DPS makes all the
difference, I guess.
