I don't really know.. everybody started from the DSP zone though.  40 people
traveling across a zone in a short period, mostly uninvis, usually creates
havoc like that though..  peoples trains collide, and it just gets out of
hand.

We were doing VT a few days ago, and running from DSP zone to umbral, I got
caught up in what appeared to be an even bigger train.

Ok I wasn't taking much care to avoid mobs, and people were training ahead
of me/behind me too (ppl seem to go many different routes to umbral,
following walls and such.. I just run across the zone).. a guildie asked me
to hold up so he could see my train (uh oh..)

So I ran in a little circle by umbral.  By this point previous peoples
trains were resetting, and agrod mine, new peoples trains agrod mine, and I
musta had 1/4 of the whole zones mobs agro on me.. I ran for Umbral, and the
mobs were all infront of me like an angry ogre-wall blocking the zone.

So I /disc stone and run straight at them (about 30 steps from the zone
line) trying to barge my way through...
Stun
FD (Fd broken)

Stun
Dead

Guildie was astonished at the number of mobs, mostly "HOLY FUCK!!" in
Gchat...  but best of all, a 9.6khp guild warrior also got smacked down in
the ensuing carnage (9 or so guildies killed)

I don't think my SS came out well, once I collided with them, I was too busy
trying to live... but man, other than dieing, the train was sheer
jawdroppingly good.
