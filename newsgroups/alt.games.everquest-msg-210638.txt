And I'm put in my place =P.  Seriously, I'm a big advocate for hoofing it
when I need to get around, and I chew out all the druids in my guild when
they don't know how to get to EJ from PoK, for example (recently came up in
an epic fight there... druid wanted a min or two to wait for everyone, so I
told him to meet me there and beat him by a long shot).  Basically, I'd
ruled out Paineel because, well, it's a city, and for the most part, Iksar
and cities don't mix.  Little did I realize you go through the zone actually
entering the "city".  When I was first checking out this option, I made an
Erudite necro to check it out, and I needed the key to get out.  I never
realized that was more just to get into the actual city, but you could go
through the zone without dealing with that.  After 3 test runs back and
forth, I think I've got a good idea of the layout of the Warrens now too (I
hope invis doesn't fade when I'm in there... that'd be quite a train =P ).

Yeah, I'm still going to look into something else, since there's definitely
times when I'll want to get out of some place that it's not just an easy
run, but for now, I've got a good grip on the run to/from LoY zones.  Thanks
for all the help, everyone.
