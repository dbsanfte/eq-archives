I disagree.  I consider myself to be poor compared to most people in
game.  I have less than 3k in the bank and I would venture to guess on
my server most have at least 10k, even the low level players.  I'm
poor because I do tradeskills and I'm continually spending the plat I
earn.  If I was interested in being rich, I could just hunt in Dulak
or other zones for the next six months and earn 1,000,000pp.

I don't think there is anything wrong with that.  Why should a level
10 player be able to have level 65 gear?  I started with cloth armor,
earned some plat to buy banded from a smith (this was three years ago)
and then got some people together to do my Lambent Armor quest. 
Lambent Armor was good enough from 25-40 which is when I started
replacing it with Singing Steel.  The armor my Bard is wearing
currently is definately low end, but it dosen't keep me from making a
name for myself as a good bard.

I guess the term "good stuff" really is subjective.  I think my
Singing Steel helm is good, but I'm sure most will think it's crap.  I
wield an Architect's Scepter which sells in the Bazaar for 1k.  I
think that's cheap when looking at the stats.  I recently upgraded
from Selo's Drums of the March and I paid 3k for that drum.  Now it
sells for under 1k.  That was a good drum for me for many levels and a
few years ago that was considered "good stuff".

OK, so what No Drop item do you want but can't have access to?
