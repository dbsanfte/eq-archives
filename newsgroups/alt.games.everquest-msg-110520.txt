I had a similar problem.  I tested all hardware and everything passed
Norton.  Mid-March it went from occassional to consistent.  After
trying a new video card since EQ support thought it was my older video
card, I continued having problems.  Running Norton again recently, I
found bad memory.  Once I took out the bad stick of memory, EQ ran
fine, albeit slower to zone and load.  Retest ALL the hardware before
replacing any.
