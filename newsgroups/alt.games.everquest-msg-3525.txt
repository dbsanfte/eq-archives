A critical failure does put you on the hate list.   The question though is
does it move you up on the hate list?  It could easily put you on with a value
of zero.  Even though you're not *really* hated, the mob still has your name
and is going to do something about  it.

Should actually do a test to determine how much of a taunt it is, if it is
one.   Have a relatively high level (preferably one without riposte) start a
fight with a gnoll pup or similar low level monster.  (You can use taunt to
start the fight without accidently killing it).  Then have another character
beg from it while you stand there and do nothing to annoy it.

I'm betting it would take a long time for the gnoll to switch over to the
beggar.  If it ever does.
