Having thought about it a bit Shaman/Necro combo might even be best of
the lot.

-Both classes have self mana regen
-Both classes have pets to tank/deal efficient damage
-Both classes can heal themselves or pets
-Both classes have root
-Both classes have decent DoTs (and OK DDs)
-Both classes can gate for easier travelling
-Necro provides snares
-Necro provides fear
-Necro provides limited crowd control with ST
-Necro can transfer mana if need be
-Necro can slow undead in an emergency
-Shaman can slow most of the time very well
-Shaman provides heals/regen/HP buffs etc

Cannot think of any situations where this combo couldn't tear through
xp giving mobs with minimal downtime.
