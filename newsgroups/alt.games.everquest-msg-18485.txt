Theres a big lava lake in the middle of the zone. Walk around it and
you'll find a big dragon skull sitting on the ground. That area there is
safe...if you look around it its surrounded by little lava streams, and
there are no spawns inside. Pull to there and kill stuff, fear will send
the mob to the edge of the lava streams and it will stay there :)
