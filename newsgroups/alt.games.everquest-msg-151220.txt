When my first guild went to hell in a handbasket a number of us
(all at least nominally "friends") decided to make a new guild.
Fully half of the people involved bailed out when the person
chosen to make the guild got sick and tired of waiting for
everybody to agree on a name and just went ahead and got the
job done.  The person who had been the biggest impediment to
agreement had a huge fit over this, precipitating a flame war
on our mailing list.  Her husband, of course, backed her up (as
if he had any real choice, marriage is a lot more important than
any game), some people chose sides, others just bailed out, and
we ended up with a tiny guild that slowly faded into nothingness.

Free advice:  (1) agree on how the guild is gonna work, (2) put
that agreement into words in the charter, (3) choose a guildleader,
(4) allow (or even require) the guildleader do her job, starting
with the meeting in chat to file the application.
