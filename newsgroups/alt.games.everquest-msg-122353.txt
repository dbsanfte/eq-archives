Better an idiot has an idiot name, then I am forewarned. Some of those seem
ok to me anyway. (superfasfists) The problem with making set rules about
what is allowed and what isnt, is that it will always be hard to filter out
the bad names without filtering out a few good ones. It would probably work
better if it was just left up to the discretion of the gm at the time (as I
suspect it mostly is anyway). Some of these (most) I agree with you
petitioning. A few I consider petty, and imposing the rules simply for the
rules sake.
