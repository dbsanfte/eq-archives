Just a couple things, the people who train you are guild trainers, which
does include the guildmaster,  OK, it's nitpicking, but just wanted to be
sure he knows he does not need to go to the guildmaster.  Any skill which
starts above level 1, needs to have one point minimum trained in it in order
to get the skill.  Most skills that start at level 1 require no training,
there are a few exceptions, I think Bash is one, I'm sure others will be
happy to provide the specifics on that.  If you really want to develop
smithing, then by all means, train 20 points into it.  And as he said, be
prepared to be broke, all the time, if you really want your smithing skill
to get high.
