   Interesting idea, but I don't see SOE adding any more specialty servers,
at least until they see how EQ is going the weather the upcomming storm of
EQ2, and to a lesser extent WoW.  Specialty servers have historically had a
lower population anyways, and since FV they haven't seemed real eager to
add any more.  Even the "hardcore" server only lasted a few weeks, and
despite at the time the several requests I saw on the official forums to
make it permanate, they soon swithced it over to being another normal rules
server.

   No, what I predict will happen is that new players, when faced with the
choice of buying EQLive or EQII, will pick up the newer version.  EQLive
will continue to lose older players at whatever the normal attrition rate
is, perhaps stepped up a bit by people who what to try the newer version as
well. 

 SOE will start to give some serious thought to collasping servers, not
adding new ones.
