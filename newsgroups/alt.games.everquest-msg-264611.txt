You remember wrong I'm afraid. You are thinking of hp buffs like 
talisman. Rune is a Enchanter spell line, which takes a gem to cast, and 
gives you a such and such hp damage protection, and a little ac. As soon 
as it absorbs it's damage, it poofs.
There are other rune like spells, but the rune line is the enchanter 
protection buff. and it sucks because at high level it takes a 10 plat 
component to give you 600 or so hp of buffer
