Whereas I've gotten almost all my freeport moths in sunken city by clearing
the nodes, in those times i logged in after a patch and had the zone to
myself. It's very difficult to keep the zone in a state you can test it
however. I guess ultimately only the devs or hackers know for sure, but I'm
willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the people i see running from
"?" to "?" afk. Mind you, in my googling i found that there's a program
people buy that controls the toon so that it does exactly that, ad
infinitum.

And here i was, foolishly playing the game by the rules. Silly me.

Hope SOE puts some trap in that finds players using this software and bans
their account, although i guess with game cards controlling bad behaviour is
difficult. Anonymity equals no accountability. Still, sending them back to
the isle would have some effect, surely!
