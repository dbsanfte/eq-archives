    If it's a one day trip, then good luck. I found with five clerics on a
raid, all needing armour, that we'd each get roughly two pieces in Hate each
per day. There's three pieces that you, as a WIS cleric, will really love -
legs, helm, BP. Gloves are trash, boots are OKish if you don't wear GEBs or
something from Western Wastes / Thurg boots, bracers WERE OK before the WIS
cap got raised, arms make nice resist gear and smithing gear. :-)
