Right off the bat, if it were a roleplaying-oriented event, I'd give
the GM(s) the ability to forcibly teleport players who weren't playing
along somewhere else. A locked cell in a dungeon zone, for preference.
If not "precariously balanced at the top of the wizard spire furthest
away from the event".

Ideally, to move the game's main storyline forward. At a pace somewhat
in excess of 'one tiny step every six to twelve weeks'.

> The characters needed? 

A character-limited (or, at least, a class-limited) event is annoying,
IMO. *If* I manage to be online when the event occurs *and* I manage
to get there before 2.45x10^92 idiots show up to wreck it, finding out
that I'm the wrong class/level/race to participate will just mean that
I'm less likely to bother trying at all the next time.  

>The gift at the end?

At the end of the one GM event I've both participated in and felt was
successful, the reward was a coin that to be given to one of the "Hall
of Heroes" NPCs in any city. The item generated appears to be
triggered by your class when you turn in the coin, so you are assured
of getting something you can (in theory) use, rather than
random_loot_001. Barring that, items that are all/all, for the same
reason.
