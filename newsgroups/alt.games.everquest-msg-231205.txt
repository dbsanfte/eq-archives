At level 61 a level 46 mob will be dark blue, and 45 will be light blue. So
anything light blue will work. You cant pick lvl 46 mobs exactly until you
turn level 62.
When youre level 65 you need just low level light blues, and theres no way
to tell. Just mem root/mez and mem flux to deal with the ones who are too
high and agro you.

There are some mobs that fall within the level requirements you still cant
charm. You just get the message "This NPC cannot be charmed".
