Nor do I think it is as bad as many believe, but I do think there is a
problem with uber items being so readily available or affordable.

You're probably right. It would be nice if there was a way to look at
that load of stuff you just took in trade for that nice bp so you know
what to sell it for.

As do I. Regardless of the pricing accuracy, I find it a valuable
