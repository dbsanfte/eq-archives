If you want to get a more accurate cross-section of the classes, go through
the list of classes using "/who all _class_ count."  This will give you a
number of the players (*including* anon/role) who play that class.  Since
you're counting at a specific time, you'll only get an indicator of the real
stats, but a pretty good one if you do it near prime-time.
