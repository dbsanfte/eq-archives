Trickster's Augmentation:  Level 52 Luclin enchanter spell (adds aggro to
recipient)

This is a very handy spell while hunting.  You can cast it on any player (or
even pet, which is pretty funny, actually...I didn't try casting it on a
critter...I'll have to try that) grouped or not, so the enchanter doesn't
have to be in the same group as the MT.

Grouped or not, it works.  No "do you want to be Imped?" confirmation box.

I cast this spell (not illusion: imp) on myself in a safe place in FV.  I
was indifferent before, and Ready to Attack after.

Don't piss of any 52+ enchanter. :-/
