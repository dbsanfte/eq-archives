Depends on the raid target and the pet user. If the mob has any sort of 
AoE, then a loose cannon pet can wipe the raid. (I watched two 
consecutive open Behe raids wipe because of unleashed pets.) If the pet 
owner has /pet hold, then it's not an issue. But if it's an open raid, 
or an inexperienced group of raiders, and you are the leader, I would 
stand in front of each pet class there and not allow them to have a pet 
unless I hear "waiting for your command to attack, master" or whatever 
it is that Jabobber says when he gets that command.

If it's some really low end raid target with no AE, then it shouldn't 
matter.
