How so?

The car I bought 3 years ago with money still brings me happiness.
The rent money I give to my landlord buys me a month of warm dry place
to sleep.  The money I spend to buy groceries buys me a week of tasty
food, staving off hunger making me happy.  The money that I pay for a
cable modem, hmmm.   Wait, that money doesn't make me happy as their
service sucks.  

A week, a month, three years, how long before instant gratification is
long term happiness?
