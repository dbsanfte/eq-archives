Most places now have newbie quests up and running for class specific
armour and weapons. I thought Halas was included in that or have they
stiffed barbs over?

If these exist, its usually a chain of armour quests in the newbie zone,
plus a final weapon or other item. While you can start doing them early it
seems to me they are ideally suited to 10-15.....thats when I did my gnome
cleric ones and mostly Im still in the armour and im still using the
weapon at 23.
