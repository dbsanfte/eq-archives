    I think that for me at least, it would be a pretty sad experience to run
around a depopulated Norrath twenty years from now.  The PoK and bazaar would be
spooky.  The silence from guild chat and age channel deafening.  I couldn't send
a tell to anyone at all.  Just thinking about it makes me want to cry.
