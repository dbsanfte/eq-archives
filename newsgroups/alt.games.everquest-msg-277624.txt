Shocking and quite frankly disapointing. Looks like the days of playing a 
game and competition are gone only to be replaced with a empty shell of a 
game.

Some of the posts by the president of SoE on the eq2forums are so insulting 
it's staggering.

The game is already lacking real spirit and direction, this just makes 
things so much worse.

The market is wide open now for a honest game with flair and heart, none of 
this /pizza /ding me attitude. Hopefully someone will come along and show 
SoE how to do it.
