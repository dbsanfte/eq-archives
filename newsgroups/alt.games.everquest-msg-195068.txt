My two run-ins with goons:
1) L46 Paladin, SoWed by L47 Druid, outran 'goon to zone.
2) L31 Druid, Wolfform, first 'goon HTs me on sight, second 'goon
kills Wolfform with Engulfing Darkness, General saunters up and
delivers coup de grace.

Note that if you do not resist Darkness your SoW or Wolfform is
irrelevant.  Can Bards still pulse Selos to break Snare?
