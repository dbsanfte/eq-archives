If you say so - you're the boss. Never had a stability issue here.

Hmm. Again - not an isue with me. See HTML so rarely in posts. I will
concede that OE does not give me the option to block HTML in email. That's a
HUGE issue with me. But in AGE almost no one posts in HTML.

DT I like your views most of the time, but I asked for specifics. Sloppy
setup, too much work and tons of security issues are too vague for me.

Prob why I question Bush so often. I refuse to accept rhetoric in the place
of facts.

I just tend to want my PC to be a slave to me, not the other way around. The
fewer pieces of SW I have to install, configure and backup the better.
