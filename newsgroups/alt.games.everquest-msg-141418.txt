I don't agree with the loss of gameplay. There would certainly be a loss 
of convenience, but I believe that, in a fantasy-based RPG, navigation 
and orientation ought to be important gameplay elements (for example, 
Sense Heading could work like tracking, capping higher for "outdoorsy" 
classes and races). Also, the presence or absence of navigational 
landmarks could be part of the difficulty level for any given zone.

As for losing corpses, I believe that the whole notion is flawed. The 
way it ought to work is, to avoid littering the landscape with corpses, 
after a few days the corpse becomes invisible to all but the owner, but 
it would never actually rot. This would increase class interdependence, 
as corpse location and summoning would have a bigger role than simply /
loccing before death (of course, a /seecorpse Joebob_01 command would be 
necessary for necros and bards to find a corpse after it becomes 
invisible).

Frankly, no matter how useful /loc is, I think that the erosion of the 
suspension of disbelief is just too great.
