Most mobs are not subject to slow mitigation.

You are already familiar, I assume, with slow immune mobs; their existance
didn't destroy the usefulness of slow did they?  Why not?  Because they are few
and far between.

There are more slow mitigated mobs in POP than there are slow immune mobs
elsewhere, thats true.  But at the same time, mitigation is not elimination.
What mitigation does is turn your uber 60% slow into a 30% slow... still 30%
better than no slow at all.  Remember back when you were a young shaman with a
mere 30% slow in your spellbook, did it help?  Helps in POP too.

On the other hand, it sure helps us clerics out in terms of looking for a job,
to have some mobs out there that a shaman can't slow so much that shaman healing
is more than adequate.  Frankly, the prevelance of high slow% clustering up at
the high end of the game effectively eliminated a need for clerics in experience
groups; a shaman or enchanter/druid combo would be more than adequate and
generally bring a lot more to the table.

At the moment, most POP groups want a slower AND a cleric, because the mobs hit
very hard until slowed, and tanks have a LOT of HP to be healed back up.  When
you face slow mitigating mobs, you still want Some slow, and you sure as Brell
want haste.

I suspect in the long run POP exp groups will end up ditching the clerics as
unneccessary again.  Unlike 56-60, we no longer contribute meaningful damage
compared even to the lowly warrior/paladin/SK, we have no helpful buff other
than Virtue (like KEI, the incredibly long duration of Virtue means you don't
need to have a cleric in your group to benefit) and there's frankly nothing we
really bring to the table other than good mana ratio heals.  But mana ratio
isn't the end-all be-all, a shaman has much better mana generation to make up
for his poorer mana ratio, and has not only the slow/haste which makes him a
viable healer, but a wealth of buffs, stat, attack, regen... and then he has
dog-dog, a buffable persitant pet that can realistically tank mez adds long
enough to stick slow or root at least.  Compare dog-dog to the cleric pet at
high levels and you have no contest at all!

If there were zones filled to the brim with slow immune mobs, and those zones
were pretty much the only places people wanted to go (see the current POV/POS
blockade) then shamen might be a similarly endangered species... but currently I
don't think you have any reason to feel threatened by a few giants in POS.
