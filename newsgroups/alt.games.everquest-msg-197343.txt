In Antonious Bayle they are only about 50-150pp most of the time Ive
looked recently - much different to the 1K they used to be. They certainly
are groundspawn, but in different places to the scales. However you will
routinely find either low level gnomes after the stuff for quest armour
and highlevel people after it for tradeskills.

As such if you arent there when it spawns up you stand a fair chance of
not seeing it...the assorted span points are on long timers.
