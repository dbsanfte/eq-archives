A guildmate came along and gave you a 97 rez?  Thats a necro
rez requiring that someone else lost exp to make the gem that
let him do it.  You were hunting in OT, so you certainly weren't
in your high 50s.  You certainly didn't need a 97 rez, a 96 rez
would have more than sufficed, in fact I wager you woulnd't
be able to tell the difference between a 96 and a 90 at your
probable level.

97 rez is for raid wipes, and it isnt the extra 1% exp rebate
that makes it interesting, its the fact that the necro can do
any rez at all.  FD in the face of a wipe, then pop up when
its safe, rez a cleric, cleric rezes the other 30 dead people,
and you are back in business.

97 rez in an outdoor zone, on some lowbie?

Either it didn't happen at all, or your rezer is an idiot.  Since
I don't know you or your rezer, I can't guess.
