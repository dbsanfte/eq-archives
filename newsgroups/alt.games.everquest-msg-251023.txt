Unless they have an overall outline.. crossing the storylines isn't
wise. Unless we throw the lore three sheets to the wind and say cause
that's how it is.

Yeah.. but asking for a black rock is a bit different then wanting the
Dain's 10th ring because you are adding on and extending the quest..
as a result you kind of have a responsibility to give a coherent setup
on the lore. I understand a lot of the time Sony doesn't bother.. but
it shouldn't be that way.

The problem usually comes in that you start to freeze previous
expansions from any change whatsoever. Only new content gets added. If
you update an old world zone, you have to worry about if you broke or
have to change the lore in other zones to match.

Lets say you have a character in new expansion A want you to do a
somewhat velious era quest because the Sleeper was predicted to be
coming back. Then later on developers think its a good idea to bring
Kerafyrm back... so they update Sleepers Tomb and add on to the
storyline. Now, unless you go back to the new expansion and update
that character.. and every other character that should have changed
because of the Velious update.. the lore will get more and more out of
date and broken. This is why you try to keep all the lore for an
expansion self-contained any more than you keep your code modularized.
You don't want to have to weed around 8 different expansions when you
make changes in 1.

Good point.

Yeah.. getting a guild raid for the Spiroc Lord or the mage piece were
bastards. 

Spiroc Lord was farmable though once there. Good thing because the
wingblade only tended to drop half the time.

And personally.. Sky raid being any more than a day, at most two in
current gear is a joke.

Not too familiar with the intricacies of the old cleric epic. I do
know they put a 24 hour turnin in sol b and then you farm the 4 shards
to spawn Ragefire. For some reason I thought Ragefire always spawned
in Skyfire. The actual fight is a one-group affair now.

The Fear tear was always a pain.

They had some post on one of the sites where some guy came up with a
Pacifist's way for playing EQ. Basically getting all xp off quests and
you couldn't kill anything.. not even a spider. I think he reached
like level 18.

Yeah... that's true.. but i never really considered leaving my
computer on overnight and selling to be work. I'm sure you could /ooc
the drops.

Yeah. Then /ooc the loot. Often times you can sell it on the spot,
especially if not looking for a pie-in-the-sky figure. Wyvern hides
and cobalt cod can be that way. Hell.. there were tailors that would
/ooc and setup deals with people farming there.

Yup.

And the profit return is pretty shitty, when you can sell them.
