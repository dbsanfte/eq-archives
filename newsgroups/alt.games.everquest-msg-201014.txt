I've got a simple 2-computer setup (both with WinXP Home), installed myself
with little knowledge of networks.  Each computer has an Ethernet network
card.  I bought a router and connected each network card to a port in the
router, then connected the router to my DSL modem.  The router came with a
CD that automatically configured the network on both computers.  Works fine
most of the time - sometimes I have to reset the router after I boot up one
computer or the other to get Internet connectivity back.

Once you've verified Internet connectivity, install EQ on your second
computer and you're off and running.
