You said you could support the statement at the begginging of the thread. I
guess you were lying.

Likewise. I never said you typed it, though you did, and it was in the
thread, just that its the idea you were supporting. Which you had earlier
denied. LIAR.

I've only replied to one post Ben, I dont care about any of your others.
You're wrong in my opinion, I challenged your points, and you wont answer
except with insults. I dont care whether you love raiders or not.

I disagreed, and made my points, then you started spewing insults. Among the
insults you said:

which is a concession of the point, not all the changes you listed were bad,
and that they didnt favor the casual over the raider. You're either lying or
VERY confused.

I couldn't care less what you like or dislike. I log on to play a game, not
to perform repetetive acts which make no sense.
Why an enemy race would forgive you for killing a single guard for a few
hundred muffins is beyond me. How they all learned you murdered the guard is
also unclear. The system was STUPID. It's good that they created
workarounds. You can still turn in your muffins & batwings tho, so this
change didnt hinder you at all. Why the hell are you whining?

Noone is being forced to, because they no longer need EC or 8 hours to sell
their stuff, they just run to the baz and do a few clicks before going afk.
Before if they wanted to sell, they had to be there, and DO it. Is that too
complicated for you? Do you need pictures?

That was never the point moron, the bazaar wasnt BUILT just for casuals, and
it didnt RUIN the game. Which is what you claimed.

Ive tried to give you several, but apparently they were too complicated.

You keep ranting that its all for casuals, but youre no longer saying it
ruined the game. I guess we're halfway there.

In your opinion, which i argued against. You still havent answered
rationally. How did the changes you listed ruin the game, and how are they
for casuals only?
Cater implies Sony serviced casuals to the exclusions of others, yet all
your points were universally beneficial. Show how something done for casuals
ruined the game, or shut up.

OK, now youre totally off the arguement. What do you want, a fucking thank
you note from all casuals? If the game isnt to their satisfaction yet, why
the hell should they shut up? Raiders "whine" just as much as casuals, and
the game is modified for everyone's benefit. Why the hell is this so
complicated for you?

Lies. You made several statements IN THIS THREAD, which were pure prejudice,
and couldn't back it up. But you go ahead & build your conspiracy theory.

Raider's time is more valuable, even if they put in less of it? Could you BE
more prejudiced? Never mind, the answer is obvious.
