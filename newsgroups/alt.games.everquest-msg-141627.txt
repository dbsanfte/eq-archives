Thats a big preference or game style decision. Check out eqdruids.com
for complete descriptions of each and decide.   I bought them all, but
have yet to use dismiss summoned, I have not hunted in zones with
elementals so far.  Spirit of Cheetah takes 15 minutes to charge up,
and last less than a minute, I have yet to pull anything that out runs
wolf form, so Cheetah is not big on my list.  Never even tried fire
resist, maybe this is needed in lava storm ?   Never tried sunbeam,
but I plan to. If you liked cascade of hail, get pogonip, samething,
more hitpoints. Tremor is your first DD area effect, it's kinda coll
but I dont use it alot.  That leaves the big 4. Skin like steel is a
decent buff, I try to keep it in effect as much as possible. Wolf form
is a must have for any druid, faster than SOW, be careful, some guards
don't like wolves, it can get you killed pretty quickly in some
places.   I use charm alot, so this is a must for me, sicking
griffawns on spiders, etc.  Creeping crud, this is another must have,
best DoT so far.  After you get CC, head over to Everfrost, snare
mammoths, hit them with CC, and kite them between the north and south
tower.  If CC or snare wears off, it takes them awhile to get throught
the ruins between the two towers, plenty of time to turn around and
recast.  They get real low , finish them off with careless lighning. A
little practice and you'll be knocking down mammoths that con blue,
white, and yellow without a problem. Behind the south tower is ruins
with a vendor, will pay you 7 pp per tusk. Good money, great exp.
