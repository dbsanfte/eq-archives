  Yeah, I am having similar thoughts.  I am finding that in order to
walk through some areas of Freeport, the best thing to do is just
press the press "Page Down" until I see nothing but the ground.

  I tend to experience the worst frame rates where I had
mediocre-to-poor frame rates before, but now they are 10 times worse.
The time the frame rates are at their absolute worst are when I'm
turning around in a somewhat graphics intense area.  I think the new
engine gets tripped up when it the scenario changes and things that
were previously visible leave the field of view, and things that were
previously outside the field of view enter it.  That "switch" seems to
tax the engine pretty hard.

  Hopefully Verant is beginning to realize where the problems lie.
