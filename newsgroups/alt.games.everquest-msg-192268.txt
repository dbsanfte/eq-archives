    You've already given these guilds more credit than they deserve. Here's
how the thought process seems to go on my server:

    Lose to mob A. See that you came close to killing him. Figure that if
you threw more warm bodies at A, that you're BOUND to win. Go get more warm
bodies. No real analysis of why the loss happened, if there's additional
efficiencies that can be gained by adjusting the strategy, just "Ugh. Didn't
die. Need more people."

    People with "dubious reputations" shouldn't ever be part of the
recruitment process. "Can I recrui..." "No."
