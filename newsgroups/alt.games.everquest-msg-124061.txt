Ditto the last when i fell off the boat and got 'run over' by it. That'll
teach me not to stand on the bow and /shout 'i'm the king of the world'. the
last thing i saw after falling from the boat was the inside of the hull.

I couldn't find my corpse and a petition was succesful and they rezzed me
into FV. A few folk had the same problem with death onboard so i suspect the
GM's are used to it by now, if you can find one online.
