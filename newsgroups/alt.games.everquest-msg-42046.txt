Thus far it allows the editing of macros and the text displayed when 
inspected. I'd like to have it edit the command buttons and hotkeys as well 
but I haven't got that part completed yet. The primary reason I started 
this project was that I hated the macro editor in EQ. (If you discover a 
typo after leaving a line in it, you have to retype the entire line.) So 
that was what I focused on first.
