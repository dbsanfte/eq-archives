Better than the "carebear servers". More of a realistic game.

Any character can survive. It depends on how well you play the character.
Being in a class that can cast: Snare, Root, etc... helps. But it isn't
needed.
One of the main problems I've seen is fighting against a bard. They tend to
run around in circles with Selo's and twisting a AoE song.

Rogues are great on PvP. Hide and sneak are SOOOO helpful! Though it always
helps to travel with a small group. Soloing can be hard, but keep to your
home
area those first 10 levels. Rivervale was great for that. I easily leveled
safely to
12 and then set out to WC, where a lot of people conned blue to me. Hardly
had any worries. Same thing with the swamp. I've yet to see anyone with guts
enough to come down in the swamp and attempt to take out the newbie trolls.
