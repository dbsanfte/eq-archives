Scalps go to someone in HHP as I recall.  Would not surprise me to find out 
more than one NPC takes them, but I am sure that there is a quest in HHP 
for the scalps, which raises at least one Freeport faction.  As I recall, 
it is better than the belt quests in Freeport, as unlike the belt quests, 
you don't take a faction hit to the opposing Freeport faction.  With the 
belts, you can choose to raise Freeport Militia, and drop Freeport Paladins 
(whatever the faction is called), or do the opposite, raise Pally faction, 
and lower Militia faction.
