Probably be a few of these stories as we approach Halloween...

Walked outside of my house this afternoon looking for my kids.  My
neighbors have apparently been decorating  for Halloween.  

As I looked next door, my first thought was to yell, "Specters on the
loose!"  I then realized it was a quite large halloween decoration
swinging from their tree.  (one of those hooded death guys - sure
looks like a life size spec though).

Got the pulse going...
