Wow, what an incredibly silly arguement.  If your point is that your
groups are so uber that you can take anything a standard LDoN dungeon
throws at you with 20% mana then I submit you're slumming and any
point you're trying to make doesn't apply to the rest of us. 

Saying why med up to full before we go into a dungeon is the same as
saying why get KEI  or haste. No reason whatsoever if you're that much
above the level of what you're hunting.  Lots of reasons otherwise.

Certainly, but now you're agreeing with what everyone else is saying.
