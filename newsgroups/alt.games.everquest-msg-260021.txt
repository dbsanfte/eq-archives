What, alcoholics can't find the bottle cap?

You're oversimplifying.

I'm attempting to explain some things are naturally more addictive
than others.  That's how this discussion started.  The misinformed and
clueless claims that "EverQuest is no more addicting than anything
else!" need correction.

Does this mean I would ban EverQuest?  Of fucking course not.  I
wouldn't ban alcohol or gambling, either.

Grow the fuck up.

Then you're clearly just a close-minded fucking idiot.  EverQuest
shares many of the same addictive elements as gambling, and nobody
(except you, maybe) would claim gambling addiction is always easily
solved with a little application of willpower.

I never claimed people with addictive personalities wouldn't "just
find another addiction", you fuckwit.  Learn to fucking comprehend
what you fucking read.

I told you, rightly so, your personal experience smelled awfully
strongly as an exaggeration, and it still does.  Like you literally
talked to HUNDREDS of people about their potential AD&D addiction and
asked them about how it affected their grades.  You're a god damned
liar.

There are things that are physically addicting, things that are
psychologically addicting, and things that are a combination of both.
Figure it out.

You're quite good at being a closed minded jackass.  I can only hope
you learn a little humility some day by having a problem where a
simple application of willpower won't solve it, and then have to
listen to other people offending you with simple "cures" that just
aren't a reasonable expectation.
