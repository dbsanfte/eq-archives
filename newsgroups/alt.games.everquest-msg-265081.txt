It's been posted here and on the official forum what happens when
you petition: you get a form email pointing out that whatever
action they take will be confidential. For all KDragon knows, his
griefer has been shot, stabbed, drowned, burned, beheaded, and
then executed.

If tech support told me not to petition I would ignore them. I
would petition anyway. It's my right. It's also my right to be
enraged by their lack of a public humiliation policy for
griefers. ;)

They actually do have a Kill Stealing policy. Their definition of
Kill Stealing is for a character that gets no XP from the
activity to be following you around and killing all the mobs you
engage for zero XP. It's much narrower than many players would
like, but it's a policy.

Agreed.

That's not a hint, that's a spoiler!
