    From what I've read I believe Martin is British, and I doubt the rest of
PDF is Euro-based. That means he stays up late to raid, if a raid goes even
mildly late. He's also talking about raids he did back when they were
difficult (my assumption), and couldn't be rolled in seconds.

    Last night my guild did Chardok royals. We AoE-killed the King and the
rest of his room, and the Queen died before my one nuke could finish
casting. On the way down my group was most concerned about getting XP,
rather than surviving (we had two clerics with The Unspoken Word memmed - we
did well for XP). And we pushed the Prince through a wall and made him warp,
and only lost one wizard before tracking him down and killing him (we were
pulling to the old Herbalist room). Compare this to my first raid on Royals,
where we near-wiped breaking Herbalist, wiped when we single-pulled King and
the Herbalist room spawns added, and were most concerned about survival IF
we managed to get to the Queen.
