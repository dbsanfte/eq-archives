There are some of us, believe it.

I also believe that some clerics *over*-loot. It would be easy to do.
Particularly in a pickup group. It's pretty hard for a cleric to overloot
in the Planes however. :-/

When I'm organising loot, I normally run a strict rotation, with new group
members added in *before* my spot on the rotation, and non-loot-dropping
MOBs excluded. Though I do complain about peridot costs sometimes...
occasionally group members will hand me some cash or a few dots, which is
very kind of them.

What gets my goat is those groups where the tanks loot everything... nobody
else gets a chance because a tank or rogue is *always* closest when the MOB
drops. And this isn't an ML setup, this is just sheer thoughtlessness.
Usually when thay happens I eventually say "Mind if I loot?" or something
of that sort; at which point the tank is usually abashed, it's rarely
deliberate.

I admit that I may not know when the chanter is Runing, since I generally
don't watch the on-screen action *too* carefully - my eyes flick between
the party HP bars, the lag-meter, and the chat window. I always Symbol
the chanter, however... chanter, tank, puller, slower, but usually not
myself. (If I get beaten on I have DA.)

I would probably have been broke repeatedly if it hadn't been for the
Trep Thilcan (sp?) shopping quest. I actually *do* have a horse (along with
a great deal of less-than-uber gear) but that was mostly due to some very
lucky vendor mining. (I bought a Centi LS for about 70 plat at one point.
I also have a copy of the Stun Command spell that I bought for 7 plat -
it usually sells for 5000ish.)

I didn't say it was a requirement (I agree it's not). I said they saw it as
a requirement... which is unfortunately true.

However, as a KEIed cleric will marginally improve MOB turnover (since it's
less necessary to be persnickety about aggro, and the cleric can nuke
occasionally) a KEIed wizard or druid will improve their DPS by perhaps
70%, and the whole group benefits. So it seems reasonable that the group
should consider covering those costs.

Thanks for the tip - I might look into this.

Monual's/Richard's account of his learning smithing seemed to suggest he
was (a) not lazy and (b) spent a ton of cash on it; I'd heard elsewhere that
learning smithing can be expensive.

But for now I'm trying to GM pottery...
