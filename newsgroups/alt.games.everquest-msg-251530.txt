We have them in a few places here too. In one of them, the on ramp is 
multi lane, but the 1-car green light switches back and forth between 
the two lanes ensuring both lanes move at the same speed. This solved 
both getting onto the actual highway, *and* getting into the ramp lane.

Previous to that implementation the two lanes had to merge just before 
the ramp which was its own separate nightmare for people in *both* 
lanes, as the fastest way to navigate that area was to advance in the 
merge lane as far as possible, before cutting into the actual ramp lane 
(which would be stopped dead for over a mile due to the actual ramp 
bottneck and thus was fairly easy to cut into), which is an extremely 
impolite way to drive. But being in the ramp 'too far back' lane was 
nuts, it could take over 2 hours to move that mile, due to all the 
merge-ins. People would actually exit the ramp lane, into the merge 
lane, and then cut back in at the front... and save an hour (and 
compounding the problem for anyone who actually stayed in the ramp lane. 
It was brutal.
