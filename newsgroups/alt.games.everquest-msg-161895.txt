Please, those Molar's did they drop from Pup's ?? or from Wolfling's ??
- I grouped up with another BST and together we killed so many Pups
that I lost count (and it WAS MANY :-)) but not one Molar dropped.
Later on in EQtraders I found thet they mention that the Molars might
only drop from the Wolflings, but they are all Yellow or Red atm... :-) 

ok, that was at 14-15, now at 19 I might try the Wolflings again :-)
