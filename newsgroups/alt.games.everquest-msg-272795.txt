Google back against my name.  To the best of my knowledge I never said the
former.  I freely admit I'm old and forgetful, but I don't recall it.  Quite
the contrary .. my nromal tendancy is to support just about any vendor
(since I code for a vendor myself, and know what it's like to get pounded on
just because of who you work for).

The latter, though, marks a change in stance for me.  I changed my stance
becuase what they're doing so smacks of suits trying to wring funds from a
somewhat desparate remaining playerbase.

SOE (the folks who spend all day in the conference rooms, not the devs)
knows their EQLive numbers are down.  They're not stupid ... they had to
expect a decline in numbers to two competing products.  I don't think they
anticipated that it would be so extreme, and I don't think they're getting
quite the bounce back they expected.  It seems that folks, having left
EQLive, are either 1) Not going back, or 2) Returning to find the landscape
so different from what it was when they left that it no longer appeals to
them, then going on to different pastures (AO's free trial, re-starting old
DAoC or CoH accounts, FFXI, WoW, or even Xbox Live).

So, to compensate and to give the impression that they still have a viable
product, they crank out a bunch of things they were going to do anyway, slap
it in a box, and wait to see what happens.

I'll be surprised if there's another expansion after this one.  OTOH, with
the lukewarm reception EQ2 has gotten from both the gaming communtiy and
gamers themselves, they may be considering cutting their losses and dancing
with the girl they brought, so to speak.
