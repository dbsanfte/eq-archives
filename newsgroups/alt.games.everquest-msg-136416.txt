Let's see, the announcements on EMarr went something like this.

Servers coming down in 15 minutes.
About 2 minutes later, Servers coming down in 10 minutes.
About 3 minutes later, Servers coming down in 5 minutes.
About 30 seconds later, You have been disconnected.

All that being said.

Quit you whining Cursism, as many others have pointed out, unless someon
other than you suffered from the disconnect, then it was indeed your
connection via whatever route it was going that was the cause of the
problem.
