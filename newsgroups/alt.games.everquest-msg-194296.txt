You are right that you should probably read it yourself, but I'll try to
explain it.

Anything that conceals your identity is illegal, according to the S-DMCA.  
On the surface "concealing your identity" sounds like something suspicious
to those unfamiliar with the basics of computer netowrks, but it's really
an integral part of being part of the Internet, as all of us here are
aware.  Unfortunately, not only do firewalls "conceal your identity", but
so does all NAT (network address translation).  Heh, so Microsoft Windows
file sharing is illegal too.  With wording as loose as the S-DMCA is, and
a good imagination...you can get pretty far.

During a 20 minute discussion at a recent hearing for the S-DMCA in
Tennessee, it was confirmed that, yes, we're not imaginging things...the
S-DMCA does make firewalls and other technology illegal.  

HOWEVER, if anyone here can prove to me that those of us who are concerned
are blowing smoke, please please try!  I don't want to be right.

Errr, you might want to hold that thought.  It _should_ be a fundamental
right, but while we've been bruhaha-ing about the war, folks have been
working to undermine it.  

(For those of you who don't know what a sunset clause is, it's the part of
the Patriot Act that causes it to expire on a hard date.  The Patriot Act
was intended as "extreme measures for extreme times", not permanent
legislature.)

> I guess Im missing something key here.

It sounds screwy because no one thinks something like this _could_ happen.  
But it has, very much so.  THe problem is two-fold.  One...it was proposed
in such a way to keep it as hidden from the public as possible (lobbyists
present them as "consensus bills").  Two...the legislators don't generally
know the last thing about technology.  When pressed, one Tennessee
representative didn't even know what a firewall was.  O.o
