Let me get this straight... you seriously think he should unsubscribe
because he's aware that SOE has decent number of dim bulbs on staff?

Seeing as *everybody knows that*... I guess we should all just quit EQ...
and cancel cable tv too... a lot of programming is stupid beyond beleif, not
to mention the odd outage, and the tv guide screwups... and maybe cancel
your phone service too... I know first hand that several of their CS reps
are lazy incompetent morons too...

Or maybe... just maybe... we're still having fun with eq, enjoy watching tv,
and think the usefulness of a telephone outweighs the fact the vendors of
all these products are chock full of imbeciles.
