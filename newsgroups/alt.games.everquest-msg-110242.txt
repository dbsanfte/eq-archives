The idea was that player-made eqpt. was supposed to replace your older gear
as it wore down. Unfortunately, there is no way to get any sort of
skill/stat adds on a player made item in DAoC (yet). Coupled with the
opening of a new high-level dngeon with some very uber-loot up for grabs, it
means that crafters are pretty much spending cash just to be able to say
they can craft at a certain level.

I've heard of a couple of tanks that use player-made stuff for day-to-day
farming, and haul out their really swanky gear for RvR, but gerneally - no
reason to be a crafter in DAoC (I'll make an exception for fletchers).

So - if EQ2 gets around that little problem, cool. People will actually want
to buy / sell player made gear. If players can just go get something better
for free, though...why buy / sell player-made gear?
