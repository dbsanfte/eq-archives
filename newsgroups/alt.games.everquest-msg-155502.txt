Well, for one thing, they weren't 'stupid'.  I'm quite sure they
didn't really *want* to do it, but they did it for others.  That's not
an example of Darwinism.  An example of Darwinism would be the family
I used to babysit for - I came over once to find that the father had
given his three year old girl a *screwdriver* to play with, and while
he sat there watching TV and his wife was in the bedroom getting her
makeup on, the little girl was attempting to insert the screwdriver
into the nearest electric outlet.  Had I not pulled her away from the
socket in time, *that* would have been Darwinism in effect - if you're
not smart enough to raise your own young, Darwin will take care of
them for you.
