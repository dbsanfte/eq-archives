Ok, lets say you have all your spells that you can get with the
Spectral Parchments.... and your friends / guild is all good to go
with theirs in that level range....    Now, what would you trade the
parchement in to, to get the best possible bang.  As in I intend to
sell the spell, so what class has the highest selling spell in that
level range?

Your insight is much appreciated.
