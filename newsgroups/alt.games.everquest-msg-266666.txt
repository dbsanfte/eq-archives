Ah yes, you're right -- the game manual is outdated. sheesh.

Well, at least you answered my question -- and I guess I feel OK with the 
High Elf now. But strength of 10??? Ouch!

To the guy who said stats don't matter: take my word for it, they do. I 
spent my whole career getting STR gear for my 60+ elf cleric in EQ 1 and I 
was fighting STR issues until I got very high. Plate armor and STR just 
don't go together well. At least not if you like to carry loot around. Maybe 
they'll have some nice cultural armor this time though.
