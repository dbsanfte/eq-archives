For the trap, go to Sol A.  Near the entrance is a scythe that swings down
from the ceiling and cuts back and forth across the path.   It's not even a
real trap, the way other traps are implemented in the game, but clicking on
it stops the swinging and checks / raises Disarm Traps skill.   (Just click
as fast as you can... no recharge time.   It goes up relatively fast)
