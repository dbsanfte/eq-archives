It's supposed to be 40.  It used to be 20, but sony expanded the
viewable items on a vendor/trader to 40 a few months ago, not sure why
you are only getting 38.

There's another question I had about the bazaar, I sometimes see a
trader in the bazaar window that has like 6 or so of the same thing and
it will say like opal stein(6), yet others will have 3 entries of opal
stein(1), anyone know what's going on or how to control it?
