Melee skills mean just about zero.  Having a nice defense would be nice, and
that will be more-or-less taken care of for you - mobs will make a beeline
for you as you heal the tanks, beat you about the head and body for a while
before either the MT reacquires aggro or you die.  Either way, your defense
will be maxed out very shortly.

In all my post-56 grouping and raiding, I've only done melee a couple dozen
times.  Usually that means we're in an easy camp or that there's another
cleric healing.  Then I summon my hammer, cast Yaulp V, and wade in.  It's
kinda weird asking chanters for haste.  =)

But that's a lark more than anything, and I have yet to see a raid called
off because there weren't enough tanking clerics.  Clerics have one main
job - stand back and heal.  Sure, you can do other minor things, but melee
is not important at all.  There are a few people who have declared
themselves battle clerics and proudly talk about how much DPS they can do.
They're still never be chosen to tank the Avatar of War.

No one, but no one judges a cleric's ability by how well they tank.  In
fact, a cleric in the 56+ game that summons a hammer and insists on tanking
will usually be laughed at.

My advice would be to forget about trying to max your melee skills and just
concentrate on healing strategies.  Figuring out how to heal without
generating too much aggro will be the key to your success in the high-end
game.  The absolutely bestest clerics in the game find a way to keep their
group alive without ever getting hit by a mob themselves.  Work on that
skill and your reputation as a good cleric will be assured.
