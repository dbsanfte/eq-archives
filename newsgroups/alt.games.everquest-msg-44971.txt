    As someone who used to solo the Spectrals in TT itself, I can tell you
for a fact the Emperor's faction is not tied to them. And as for where to
hunt them.... well, remember how they told you that you'll need ITU to get
to the Emperor? That's because in front of his cave is maybe a dozen or two
dozen Spectral spawn points, spaced all over the place. I used to be able to
single pull them at level 48 or so from those small huts you see them in
near the EJ zoneline, and once when grouped we were able to single them from
in front of the Emperor's cave. If you took a group to that area, you could
kill them without end at whatever pace you could manage and not run out of
mobs that are within a bowshot - give it a try!

    As for the Forager and Hunter, well, they hit harder than you may be
used to (I seem to remember 100 point shots), but otherwise are quite
killable. I'd strongly recommend a REAL tracker (read: ranger) be brought in
to do the pulling, as they spawn quite a distance from the zone line you'd
likely pull towards. They can also rarely drop Kunark quest spells (the
level 51 to 54 ones), so Tiru could get lucky. You'll need a full group,
because if a rare spawns (and they do quite frequently) you'll likely need
the firepower to kill it - they can be tough. The rares that drop stuff have
some pretty neat and unique drops - you could come away with some nice
stuff. And if the rare that spawns is Doom - your day is over. Leave.
