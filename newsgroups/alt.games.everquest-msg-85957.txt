I'm pretty sure that's incorrect.  Bards have NO kick still and still get 
ID.  It sucks rotten eggs, but we get it, and some of us have even 
practiced it until we max out at 100.  I did use it for a short bit while 
I was fear-kiting, but since you get both ID and the fear song at 26, and 
the first charm song at 27, I quickly tired of fear-kiting.
