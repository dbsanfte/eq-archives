Hum I went through my log and saw a bit where I wasn't 
indiff to an orc, pasted it in, wandered away for 
awhile, then came back, read the last paragraph and 
replied, sent, then went "D'OH" when I thought about the 
whole post again.  If you see it before I cancelled it, 
you can be amused by my lack of ability to connect to 
pieces of a post together :)
