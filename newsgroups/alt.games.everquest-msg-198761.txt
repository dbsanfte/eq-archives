He said he spent three weeks camping the same mobs. You clarified that it 
was done helping get others flagged. How the *Hell* are we not talking 
about unreasonable guild expectations or at the very least, self-martyrdom?

Right. I won't listen to Mr. I've Been There So My Views Are THE Most

representative of situations that could just as likely be the result of 
human nature and a false sense of community as they are game flaws. 
Therefore, yeah, I am still skeptical. Blow me.
