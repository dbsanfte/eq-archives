Depends on your level and where you hunt. For example, in Paludal up to
level 25 I would snare/root a bandit then dot and ping a few arrows then
finish off with melee. The pp and armor they drop would cover the cost of
arrows too. Did the same with gnolls in SK and rygorr in EW. The rygorr were
a slower kills than fear kiting but dropped pp and sometimes orc earrings or
necklaces so they seemed worth while. With dot and a few well placed arrows
you get a mob to half hp then when you melee you only need to knock off
another quarter before it starts fleeing, then you can ping a few more
arrows if you want. High dex helps too ofcourse, and you only crit with bow.
Also make your own arrows, good for fletching skill and filling out med
time, but only use the cheapest arrows when training up skill. Finally a
haste item and haste quiver can help, along with a good bow 20/37, 30/40
etc.
