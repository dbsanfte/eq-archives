Ive seen it chant kitting but I was within spitting distance of the
zone wall and assumed that they had stupidly walked into the wall and
off the other side.. They never came back to get me, or any of their
buddies.

Depending on the zone though as long as its still targetted and you
can invis and run about, you can probably find it by looking for your
target ring (useful finally a use) and at least know where they end
up.
