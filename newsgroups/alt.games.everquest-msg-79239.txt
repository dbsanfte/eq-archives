I've certainly to zone. I've played for almost 3 years, so I do know -some-
stuff. Simply, the zone was much much farther away than the guard was. I
know the zone will always be there and I use it when I need it and think I
can make it. Otherwise, I still run to the nearest guard.

And no, there wasn't any satisfaction in that. I'm sorry I did it and wish I
could undo it, but all I can do is try to patch it and then learn from it.
