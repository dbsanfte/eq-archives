See if you can get a runed circlet, drops in Permafrost.
You can get this and the mammoth cloak on the same
trip. =)

Runed Circlet
AC: +4 Wis: +4 Int: +4
Weight: 1.0

You want the Temple of Ro Quest Cleric bracers:

Bracers of the Reverent
MAGIC ITEM
AC: +9 Wis: +5
Weight: 3.0

http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=245

Kind of a pain in the ass camp but well worth it for these beauties.

> Arms: Platinum Armband: +3 STR, +3 WIS, Wt. 0.3

You should be able to pick up some ulthork hide arms pretty cheap
or head to EW and get them yourself, in a group. Same wisdom but
higher AC.

Look for Adamantite Epolets:

Adamantite Epaulets
MAGIC ITEM
AC: +9 Wis: +7
Weight: 4.5

http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=1051
Drops off the ghoul cavalier in lower guk, or usually goes for 100-200

Yes its an easy camp but a long one unless you get lucky. You need
a friend or 2 to help you, especially someone with invis to get you into
the room.

> Waist: Straw Spun Belt: +10 AC, Wt. 6.0
> Possibly quest for: Belt of the Cenobite: +5 AC, +7 WIS, +10 vs. Cold, Wt.

You can quest for the Temple of  Ro Cleric legs if you want the AC.
Easy Quest to do, very easy actually:

Greaves of the Penitent
AC: +13 Int: +5 Poison Resist: +5  Weight: 5.6

http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=687

> Feet: Acolyte's Anklet: +3 AC, +3 CHA, +2 WIS, +2 AGI, Wt. 1.2
>
> Primary Melee: Sceptor of Flame: 1H blunt, Delay 29, Dmg 7, +15 MANA, +5 vs.
> Fire, Magic, Wt. 4.5

See if you can pick up a:

Velium Etched Stone Mace
Damage: 7
Delay: 22
Ratio: 3.142 Good
Str: +3 Wis: +3
Weight: 6.9

Drops off of Yaka Razorhoof in the Great Divide named tizmak.
Easy to get at your level in a group or to buy.

> Secondary Melee:
> Soloing: Charred Guardian Shield: +10 AC, +9 WIS, Wt. 8.0
> Grouping: Testament of Vanear: +10 WIS, +10 MANA, Wt. 2.0
>
> Ranged: Nothing
> Possibly have made: Small Wisdom Deity: +2 WIS, Wt. 0.1
> Possibly quest for: Medicine Totem: +5 AC, +5 WIS, Wt. 6.5

If you can do the Thurgadin shawl quest up to the 3rd step
for a very nice range slot item:

Seal of Thoridain
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP
AC: +3 Wis: +3 Int: +3 Magic Resist: +3 Cold Resist: +3 Mana: +30
Weight: 1.0

The quests requires some trade skilling:
