Well all it does is take some STR and a little AC off the mob. The STR 
debuff isn't enough to change the mob's damage output much and generally 
its just a waste of mana unless you are using it in PvP, where you might 
encumber your opponent.

Better to save the mana and use the spell slot for something more useful, 
even if its just keeping gate memmed or something (I never have the luxury 
of that with my 39 ENC, but at level 14 you probably don't have many other 
spells to fill the slot).

Actually, another option would be keeping whirl till you hurl memmed. At 
higher level, these sort of spells are useless since your tanks will hit 
the mob so many times so quickly that they'll break the stun almost as soon 
as it lands (stick to the color flux line), but at level 14 it will keep 
the mob stunned for a couple of rounds.

Or languid pace, but that takes an awful lot of mana at this level...
