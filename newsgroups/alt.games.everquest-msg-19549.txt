Why is it that so many people think that all a cleric can do is sit and med,
or stand up real quick to heal the tanks?

I've played with idiot clerics who are FM and don't heal the tank at 1
bubble, and I've played with superb clerics who heal when it's needed, stun
judiciously and occasionally whack things with a stick.

Of course, if they chain stun and keep failing, get aggroed and die, it is
kind of their own fault, but it seems to me that I've seen the cleric go
down more often when he gets aggro from either chain healing somebody or
from the extra taunt value of sitting down next to something that wants him
dead than from stunning something silly.  Also, the stuns take hits off of
the tanks and actually save mana, if we dont get hit, we dont need healing.

With enchanters, I LOVE being in a group with a good one who can do more
than just clarity/haste ( although I do enjoy smacking things down twice as
fast ), particularly if they are mezzing stuff.  However, along this line,
when you have a full group, 3 or 4 tanks and 2 or 3 things to kill, and
everybody is yelling at you to get on the same critter as them and stop
breaking mez, GET OFF THE CRITTER AND STOP BREAKING MEZ!!  and if you have a
chance, let the Enchanter mind wipe the mezzes before you break it, that way
they don't get aggroed and die.

Just my views, too many idiots who think clerics are just healers, and
enchanters are just clarity/haste ( and don't know the sheer beauty of being
able to shove goblins in cold storage for a few minutes )
