Hi All;

When doing an LDoN, I usually like to assist melee since I can't sit and med
much. I use my summon Hammer of Damnation which proc's pretty good, and
Yaulp VI. I like to contribute to the damage instead of standing around or
the occasional sit/med.

I've recently got my epic water sprinkler (yeahhh). I've tried using it as a
weapon and it hits harder than my summoned hammer (when I hit at all), but
obviously no proc.

I have my main stats max'd, ie., 1h bash, defense, offense, bash. Dex when
buffed up of around 260. Yep, I do realize I'm not a tank, LOL.

My question: I've considered putting a combat spell type aug in my epic, but
before I spend the hard earned points, do you think I can make it proc
enough to be worth it?

Thank you all in advance for you help and suggestions.
