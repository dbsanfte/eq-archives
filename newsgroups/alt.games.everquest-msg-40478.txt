solciting opinions on the following subject:

As a bard who can start to use musical instruments, is the benefit that the
extra instrument holds better than carrying a weapon at times, or forget the
instrument.  I ask because I noticed a big difference between Selo's
Acclerando when I used a drum and when I didn't.  So when I get to higher
levels, should I start leaving the weapons in a pack or something and have
my instruments more readily available.  (I only ask because I noticed that
the drum could not be carried at the same time as anything else.
