Personally, I think "hiding" only makes the problem worse. Show people
that you're ashamed of it, and they're only that much more inclined to
use it as a weapon against you. Show them you're afraid of them, and
the same thing happens. Those are the only reasons to hide it.

Be proud, be brave, and, sure, you'll still get harassed...but it's
only that much worse when it comes out (and it will eventually) if you
hide it. Worse, the fucking homophobes become even more asinine about
it because they have some perception of being betrayed.
