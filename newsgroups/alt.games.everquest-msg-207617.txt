Well, if you phrase it that way ("work together somewhere, with some variety
of tactics" then any duo is effective: there will be some mob that the more
powerful of the duo can just barely not solo, that the duo can take down,
and so there's a place where that duo is effective.

However, I think by " effective" most people want more than that...at least
a fairly large number of situations where the duo does better than either
would do solo.  Under that definition, I don't think two Wizards are an
effective duo.  They simply can kill mobs twice as fast, for half the
downtime, so the only thing they gain is the grouping bonus.

There are a couple things that come to mind that two Wizards could try that
might make them effective, but I don't know how well these would work.  One
could gather several mobs, and then train them to the other.  That gatherer
would hit the mobs with Thunderbold (AE 600 damage + 3 second stun).  While
the mobs are stunned, the second Wizard could let fly a PB AE and then run
away a little.  When the stun wears off, the first Wizard could Thunderbold
them, and the second could use a PB AE.  Repeat.  Thunderbold has a long
recycle time, which is the reason for the Wizards alternating it.

Another idea for two Wizards would be to use root and rain spells.  Rain
spells cause three waves of damage, but the damage is centered around where
the mob was when the spell first hit.  If the mob moves away, the subsequent
waves miss.  If only one wave hits, the spells have a mana efficiency about
half that of our nukes (at least, for Wizards below 60...60 Wizards get a
big boost in efficiency).  If two waves hit, it's about break even.  If
three waves hit, we are very happy.  So, one tactic is to root the mob, then
use the wave spell, and hope that on average we get at least two waves
before root breaks.  With a second Wizard, the duo could root, then one
casts a wave, while the other casts root again, timed to land just after the
first wave hits, so that the mob gets rerooted if root breaks.  If two
Wizards could this way get it so rains are effective, the gain in mana
efficiency might cut downtime enough to make it worthwhile.
