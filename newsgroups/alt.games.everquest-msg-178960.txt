Hail and well met, friends. I hope the battle finds ye well! As I recover
from me wounds and bask in the glory of my latest victory (having attained
my 36th winter this very day), I reflect now upon many unresolved questions.
Here they be:

1) If a weapon offers a "damage bonus", is this calcluated into the overall
DPS in the sense that a 25 delay, 10 damage with a 3 "damage bonus" is
effectively a 25/13?

2) I was with a hunting party in Lower Guk recently and was surprised to
find that several members of this party refused to fight the frogloks that
happened upon us as we made our way to the undead. They cited concerns
regarding faction issues with frogloks. Given all of the non-aggro frogloks
that we passed on our way to LG, I take it the concern is to avoid
complicating that entry, although I neglected to ask. Is this likely the
issue?

3) If so, then I have another question regarding a new hunt that I have
located in Firirona Vie. There's a great spot where I can solo drolvargs all
day long and mete out good Shaman justice. There are, however, many frogloks
(aye, even of me own profession!) running about. I have been avoiding this
easy prey on account of the faction issue above. Is this a wise domestic
policy, or am I wasting a good opportunity?

Thanks for the insights and I hope to see you on the battlefield!
