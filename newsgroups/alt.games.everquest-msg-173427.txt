Its very handy for you to be able to explain away all criticism of your
beloved country with "its just anti-americanism" without having to look into
the reasons for the sentiment. (of course, Im sure you will put it down to
jealousy or hatred of your freedoms or some other equally ridiculous excuse
(as is evidenced by your Mark Steyn fetish).
The real reasons for anti-american sentiment is the imbalance and abuse of
power that has characterised US foreign policy in the last 10 years.

Mark Steyn's rhetoric has nothing to do with the link between Iraq and 9/11.
He blusters about the poor USA who is under seige by the evil muslims on one
hand and the Europeans who hate them because they are trying to protect the
world (sarcasm), but at no point does he come up with any reason to bomb
Iraq over and above the same, and more compelling reasons to bomb Sudan,
Saudi or North Korea. You believe him because he makes you comfy in the
knowledge that it is not you that is at fault, but everyone else in the
world. Enjoy your comfort Dan, just remember that your comfort is paid for
by 80-90% of the world's population, and they arent going to take it for
much longer.

The "Blood for oil" bumper-sticker viewpoint, as you so dismissively call
it, is the most believable reason for the US's choice of secondary target
(Iraq) in the "War" on "terror".
Three of the four most internationally-contraversial descisions that the
Bush administration has made are related to the use and future shortages
perceived in the world's resources
.
1. Application (and approval) to drill in Alaska.
2. The CIA-backed coup of the Chavez government in Venezuela (a large
oil-producing economy).
3. The rejection of the Kyoto accord.

And now we have the Iraq war.
The war that was originally claimed to be part of the war on terror, then,
since this viewpoint was untenable, it was changed to be because of Iraq's
WMD programs and breaches of UN resolutions.
Of course, the US has decided it will act with or without US support, which
in effect is making the US a rogue state itself, as if that was in question
before.
Now, of course, since the UN weapons inspections are not giving Bush his
all-important reason to attack, the focus has switched back to it being part
of the war on terror, but no-one in your country seem to give a shit about
questioning it this time around.
It pretty simple to see, Dan, if you dont clog your head up with Mark Steyn
and Ann Coulters hateful and insular rhetoric.

1. It would allow the US to put in place a puppet regime as it has done in
many of its closer neighbours in central/south america. This regime would
not prevent the US from having access to its oil reserves. The two countries
who have recently prevented shipping of oil to the US are Iraq (say no more)
and Venezuela (CIA-backed military coup).

2. The costs of waging the war are not important, because the war gives
justification for the huge grants and assistance given to weapons developers
by the federal government (who are supposed to be opponents of federal
interference in business), and of course, it also justifies the enormous
defense budget, and gives a handy excuse for why the public services are in
such a sorry state.

3. The price in having a US-friendly regime in Iraq (one of the countries
that controls world oil prices) is beyond measure.

You havent nailed me on anything so far, you havent really *said* anything
at all.

OK...now tell me *exactly* why the US is attacking Iraq, and not say Saudi
or North Korea, without resorting to Mark Steyn's particular brand of
"wisdom".
