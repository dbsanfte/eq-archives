It's inevitable that SWG will get compared to EQ in terms of content
and features. One thing that we have to realize is that EQ has been
out much longer (duhh) and has had much more time to develop and grow.
Of course SWG wont have as much content. It would be foolish to expect
the same depth as EQ. Compare EQ when it started back in March 99 to
now. Certainly SWG will offer more than EQ did when it started.

Planning it now I can see. Devoting a large amount of man hours to it
now seems overboard. Id rather see them take some of that energy into
the initial development, offering more at launch. Its probably a way
for them to charge us for more content more quickly.

As I understand it, each server will be much like EQ, each being a
parallel universe as opposed to a single shared galaxy. So, there will
be the messing around with character transfers. But this leaves open
the possibility for server rule sets should they wish to implement
that in the future.

A shared galaxy obviously has its advantages and disadvantages. The
biggest disadvantage I can think off right off the bat is, imagine if
theres a nexus type zone (or bazaar) where people tend to congregate.
Imagine the lag if 5000 people are just hanging around in the same
area.
