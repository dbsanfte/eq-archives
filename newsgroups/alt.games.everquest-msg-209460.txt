How do you get all that out of "as reasonably equipped as you can
manage".  You took my comment out of context, where I was warning
somebody that refusing to purchase gear in the bazaar nowadays
would put him at a substantial disadvantage.  I actually went to
some trouble to avoid implying the sort of BS you're unreasonably
inferring.  Even after lifting what I said out of context you leap
to patently unreasonable conclusions in reply.  The only slippery
slope here is entirely your own invention.  If I suggest that you
head north you're gonna blame me because you headed 1 degree north
of due west and fell off a cliff?

Again, how does "as reasonably equipped as you can manage" even _begin_
to suggest "cover myself in quipment and buffs that can only be leeched
from the highest level characters"?  Your argument is nonsense, it's
nearly weightless and even so isn't strong enough to support its own
weight.

That would be stupid.  The correct response is to place the person
who tells you that on your ignore list, and make a note of guild tag
if any.  Oh, and I wouldn't worry about that Enchanter you were going
on about, she'll almost certainly not be playing that character for
too much longer.


> That isn't an EQ I have the slightest interest in playing.

If you had read the various "fix the group buff bug" threads in which
I was one of those railing against the way KEI for lowbies had wrecked
the low level game I don't think you'd have directed this particular
rant at me (oh, and KEI _is_ c3, btw).


nice rant, hope your next play session isn't so irksome,
kaev
