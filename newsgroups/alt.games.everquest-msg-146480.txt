I don't see how the Shaman/Druid thing can make Clerics unviable for such a
small range of levels.  If groups members were required for some reason to
all be withing a level or two of each other, I could see how a class getting
some ability at level X could make another class much less viable in groups
at level X, but that's not the case in EQ.

Why can't those 54 Clerics just keep grouping where they did for 53?
