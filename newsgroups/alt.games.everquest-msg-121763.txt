I passed up on Velious right before they stopped shipping it to stores at
about $15.  I ended up having to buy it through Sony Station's store online
for about $26 after shipping.  You can get it there, but you might as well
buy the Trilogy for a few bucks more.  Maybe you can give or sell the extra
cd's and keys you won't be needing to a friend.
