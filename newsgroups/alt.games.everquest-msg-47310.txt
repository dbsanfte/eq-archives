No no no..we're not calling your everquest character a troll..we're calling YOU
(the person who manages to turn on the computer and click the AOL button
everyday) a troll. And seeing as you're more dense than a ball of lead, I'll
define "Troll" (when used in a Usenet group) for you.
Troll:  someone who A) posts messages unrelated to the newsgroup repeatedly
and/or for the sheer purpose of getting the rise out of the group, or B) even
after repeatedly being asked to do their own research on a subject which DOES
pertain to the newsgroup, does not, and continues  to ask question which have
been explained in detail earlier.

There. Did that hurt?

Second of all, if you're 40 and going to crushbone for any other reason than
revenge (I got aggression out on D'vinn for ages when I hit 35), helping low
level friends, or ghetto farming the DRT, you are a complete and utter schmuck,
most likely handed the account or power leveled all to hell, and are a disgrace
to the game.

Go back to playing Counterstrike or whatever..
