So who goes to all of those in one day?  What you do is 
keepa record of the prices when you go somewhere, watch 
the flyers, figure out when they usually put what you 
want on sale, and do the shopping for that item then.  
So *maybe* once a week I go to each store and buy what I 
need.  Of course, I also practice bulk cooking so I've 
usually got enough to last me a month or more.

Now see, I've looked at the other video games, but since 
this is the first RPG I've played, the others just 
confuse me :)  I looked at DAoC and thought "huh - 
sounds exactly like EQ."  I usually wait until everybody 
*else* has tried it (heck, look how long it took to pick 
up EQ even though everybody was saying how great it was) 
and then if it's good, I'll try it out.
