And if we really need to compare EQ prices to real life, compare to computers
and hardware. Every time something new show up, the old stuff falls a LOT in

you cant even give the stuff away.
Just as in EQ.

Totally agree there. And if DAoC have item decay on all items like people
stated in another thread, ill predict that the guild members we lost to DAoC
will be back in a month or so.
