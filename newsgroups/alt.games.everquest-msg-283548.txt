I overlooked gnomes!  (Yes, thats a shortcomming of mine)

Gnomes are  perhaps the premier race on Norrath, with a wide range of 
classes, and the advantage of being shorter than all other races, plus 
none of the annoyance of beard maintenance that you see amongst the 
taller worshippers of Brell.  The down side, for me, is that the 
incessant ticking ticking ticking of  the clockworks reminds me of the 
ticking ticking ticking of the deathwatch beetle, ticking ticking 
ticking in the Telltale Heart.  Gives me a tic just thinking of it.  But 
there's tinkering to think of.  My mage didn't get so much use out of 
this, although I did pursue it far enough for a supply of stalking 
probes to give to my puller warrior friend.  But if I were to go with a 
tank class, maybe I'd go further with it, put together some clockwork 
armor and the like.  Could be fun.  Down side (with gnomes, its all 
about downsides) is that the mage that I've been playing for 66 levels 
is a gnome, maybe its time to play something different.

Funny that my two top races were dwarf and gnome, both Brell worshippers.

I think one advantage to dwarf gnome and halfling, and to a lesser 
extent wood elf and dark elf, is that, being low to the ground, it looks 
like you're running faster than you are, at least in first person which 
is how I play.  Parallax, I think they call it, the reason 40 mph in my 
wife's ancient Escort feels faster than 60 mph in my F150 pickup. 
Playing one of the really tall races; Vah Shir, Ogre, Troll, Barbarian, 
makes doing anything without SOW on feel like you're crawling.  Play one 
of those races as a rogue, in stealth mode?  I'd feel like I couldn't 
get my car out of second gear!
