As far as I know, your best bet is to con them.  Your faction with certain
groups may have changed in your 11 seasons without you even knowing to pay
attention to it.

You can do them (gather the items, etc.), but your faction does make a
difference as to whether or not you can complete them.  Lysbith McNaff is a
great example of that.

Another example ... my wood elf ranger was trying to complete the Red V
Clockwork quest in AkAnon.  My dwarven cleric could run around the mines
without worry from the baddies down there, but when the wood elf came across
the necro guild ... SPLAT.  "Oh, crap!", I thought.  Corpse run from GFay,
try to get close enough to summon corpse ... SPLAT.  Two or three SPLATs
later, it became obvious that I was going to need help.  Thankfully, a kind
Gnome Necro in Steamfont drug (dragged? <g>) my corpse out for me.  I would
mention him by name, but I promised him that I wouldn't ... he didn't want
to ruin his evil reputation. <g>

Sometimes the quests as listed on Allakhazam will mention the faction needed
to complete the quest.

If your faction is high enough, you can complete any quest for any class.
My lowbie wiz completes the bone chips quest in Kaladim all the time, and
promptly sells the armor and weapons (or donates them to newbies if there
are any around).

What server are you on?  I was thinking of taking my lvl 12 wood elf ranger
from the Karanas to Everfrost just for a change of scenery.  WK is okay solo
hunting for bears, cats, giant spiders, and the like.  It's hard to solo the
bandits because they spawn in groups.  At least on Cazic-Thule, there are
never enough people in WK to group the bandits.  At 12 the orges, scarecrow,
and wandering spirit are all still very red to me.

Heh ... been there, done that.  My wife is pretty accepting of my gaming,
though.  I think she realizes that it's *much* better situation for her if
I'm downstairs as opposed to out at a bar, etc.  Heck, she even picked my up
a PS2 for Father's Day! <g>

Good deeds beget good deeds.  I'm glad to hear that! <g>

Good hunting!
