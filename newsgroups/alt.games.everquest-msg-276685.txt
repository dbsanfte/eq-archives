I have not had recent experience with it, but, in the past, I had little 
difficulty getting items replaced that were lost due to a bugged quest, 
or some other in game bug.  Just give a polite, succinct description of 
events, including as close as possible to the exact time, and, if 
appropriate, /report to capture the text in your chat window.  All that 
being said, my experience is over a year ago, and things could well be 
very different in regards to them replacing items now.
