ok, hooking multiple computers thru dsl is relatively easy
is you dsl modem internal or external?

if internal
then one NIC in each computer and use windows 98/ME and ICS on puter with
dsl card

if external,
it still needs one NIC in each puter, this one works best with a hub unless
you dsl modem has multiple network ports (heard they exist, mine only has
one)
connect dsl modem to crossover port on a hub, connect both puters to 2 other
ports on hub, first puter should already be configured
if you needed to put in an IP address configuring first puter, you need to
order a second IP from isp to configure second (all other data should be
same tho)
if it works like mine, dsl modem is actually a NAT router, and will
configure all puters on my network automatically

of the 2 choices, i much prefer the external, i can add as many puters as i
care to internally to my home network, all sharing my dsl line
