Subject: best places to find group beside Kunark?

I have gone the freeport, North Ro, Oasis, Ill Omen, FM path, and I would like
to find a better place that is kinder to the good races/noniskars.  I have just
gotten Luclin but haven't ventured up there yet.  

Does anybody have any suggestions where a lvl 32 warrior may find zones that
not only have good places to camp, but also have plenty of people to group
with?

Permafrost looks good, but I don't want to go all the way there from FM to find
out it's nomans land just to have to go back to Kunark.  

For other up and coming charcters, what's the alternate path to advancing
besides the above mentioned one?  I've brought 2 charcacters up that way and
I'd like a change of scenery.

Thanx
