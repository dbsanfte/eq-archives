Mid 20s are a good time to start the questing for the great looking
golden Clerical quest armour. The AC is better than Bronze, most
locations are the same as Rygorr. The best piece is the wrist eq, 9 AC
and +5 wisdom. The quests basically consist of finding a couple icons.
Some are lying on the ground, some are on creatures. You can find
details at allakhazams:
