Frankly I just don't buy this argument. Druids ROCK! post 50 in raids.
My guild leader is a 60 Druid, and overall our guild is very "druid
heavy". It is absolutely AMAZING what Druids can add to a raid. 

1. Snare and Kite adds until the group(s) are ready for them
2. Root park adds
3. Damage Shield the melees
4. Assist/Backup healing. Chloroblast is very fast casting and allows
the clerics to concentrate on the MA.
5. Regen
6. DoT
7. DD
8. Succor on bad pulls (with the addition of lessor Succor ALL raid
capable druids can inter-zone evac not just level 57+)

Druids are AMAZINGLY versatile. If post 50 druids think they are not
"powerful" enough, then they are not fully using the tools at their
disposal. Druids are, and have always been, one of the best group
classes.
