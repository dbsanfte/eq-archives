Not necessarily so, or DR and CP/M would still rule. Healthy competition
is what every market needs. All benefit under that scenario. Going back
the the automobile scenario, if one producer had a 94% share of the
market, would we have disc brakes, overhead valves, super/turbochargers
etc., today? I think not. You would have whatever the owner of that 94$
share dictated you should have.....
