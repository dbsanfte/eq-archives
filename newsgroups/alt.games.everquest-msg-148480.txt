The world is governed now and always has been by the aggressive use of force
. Israel is unique in that they keep getting whacked and choose to talk
about it instead of whacking back. This works as well as any reasonable
person would expect. It is almost funny how ineffective Israel has been in
defending itself and its border.

One good atrocity 50 years ago would have solved all there problems while
protecting there people and economy. You know sorta like the one Jordan did
against the palestine people. No good deed ever goes unpunished and Israel
is paying out the ass.
