I was wondering what the formula for calculating damage for a warrior is?
There used to be sites out there but since getting a new computer and all
the changes I am having trouble finding anything that clearly explains all
involved in combat.

If anyone could either explain to me here, give me a link, or a up to date
dmg calc I would much appreciate.
