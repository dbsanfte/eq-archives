Oh, and just before you go ask the same question on www.eqtraders.com:
You can NOT just get tailoring up to shawl skill fast. Take a LOT of 
time to get tailoring up. You might be able to speed it up if you got 
the money for it to pay high prices for the materials to start with, but 
the shawl is not something you just go get. And tailoring is not 
something that you just go master.
