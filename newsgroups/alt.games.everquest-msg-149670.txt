Monks do more sustainable damage than just about anyone, take
damage under ordinary situations better than just about anyone,
have substantial self healing abilities, and have the miraculous
ability to drop out of almost any situation thats gone bad and
survive, without even having to abandon their position.  They can
solo, main tank for groups, pull for groups, be damage production
for groups, pull for raids, be major portion of damage production
for raids, perform CRs for individuals, groups, or raids, and (equipped
with a staff of forbidden rites) rez a rez capable class to get a raid
back on its feet quickly.  What can't they do?  Port.  Outlandish.

CHeal.  Noone else has it.  There are things you simply cannot do
without it.  Further the rest of their heals are all better than almost
any other heals in the game, only Torpor comes close.  That not
enough for you?  Well, they also get the best rez line in the game
(yes, technically necros can do better, but not on a sustainable
basis, its really just a way to transfer exp from one character to
another) and get it far earlier than their only real competition.  Still
no good?  Well they get root and nuke good enough to allow them
to solo (if clumsily) and now at high levels, melee plus pet capable
of a damage output comperable to the "damage absorption" tank
classes and damage absorption comperable to the "damage production"
tank classes (excepting monks)  What don't they get?  Slow.  Snare.
Heck, DE clerics even get snare!

Quad kiters, ideal AE group members, high rate of mana to
damage conversion making them the kings of "kill this now"
fights, up to where Manaburn teams can take down most
any challenge in the game.  And they get ports.

> > Bards

I can't even begin to explain this one, if you haven't seen it
in action.  Bards are without a doubt the wimpiest class
in the game.  They can do anything, none of it well.  But..
But... But... they spend no mana doing it, and have the
most flexibility to allow them to match their tactics to the
situation.  Long term sustainable casting capability means
that there are few mobs they can't defeat, just a matter
of thinking and time.

>
> > Druids

Like wizards, they can perform miracles with AE.  In
addition, they make fair healers if you aren't in major
trouble, have DS and regen, unmatched snare capabilities,
and decent track capability, and again, ports.

> > Shamen

With very serious slow capability, hastes, DOTs,
a workable pet, decent melee skills, acceptable
heals, amazing mana production capability, these
guys can turn hard fights into cakewalks, or solo
mobs that no other class can; like bards, given
the time there's little they can't pull off.  Good soloers
(especially with the new bonus for killing higher
con mobs in place to counteract the quadding of
wizards and druids) highly desired for groups and
a vital part of most raids, what can't they do?
Port.  But at least they can gate and use a stone
to go to their home zone.

>
> > Rogues

Outrageous damage production, great damage avoidance
(in this case via letting someone else get hit, mind you) and
the ability to go almost anywhere without aggroing mobs,
this isn't a complex list like some.. but at what they do,
they really blow away the competition.

I'm suggesting that there really isn't one.  Just that most people
think there is one... but that they don't realize they are thinking
of one class while the next guy who thinks there is one is thinking of
another!

Someone said necro.  I can make that arguement.  Could also
make it for enchanters.

Paladins, Shadowknights, Warriors, Mages, Rangers... I'd have
a hard time making the arguement.  They certainly are powerful
classes, but I can't see a case for "they are overwhelmingly better
than all other classes"

Beastlords, frankly I don't know enough about at high levels to
even get close to formulating an arguement.
