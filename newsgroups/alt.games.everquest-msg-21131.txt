I agree Dan, usually as long as your petless, go up and punch each one as
they have engaged them.  Make sure its ok though.  No sense getting a group
petitioning because you "kill steal" even though your there just for
faction.  You may even make a few new friends, and in this game your
reputation means everything, so good luck.  I'm sure you'll find a group
that is more than accomodating.
