I went and did the same thing.  I did find one interesting fact out; 
Hide works versus both live and undead, even for a non rogue.  I'd 
thought somehow that too was unique to the rogue, but it isn't.

Of course the process is also far far easier with a rogue, due to the 
messages you get telling you whether you have succeded or not.

I made a new rogue, played her ten levels thus far, and its tedious 
going those first ten levels; with no backstab, you're pretty much a 
generic melee, only with even less going on, no kick or anything.  But 
as a halfling rogue, I had hide and sneak to play with, and play I did; 
the tutorial has to be one of the best places out there for a rogue, 
with chests located behind big scary mobs, and with no trade items 
dropping that people often announce because they can't use them.

I worked out the details of the "evade" trick, at least I think (I 
soloed a fair amount, and when grouped was often with a healer and/or 
pet class, so I ended up as not only main tank, but only tank.)  Anyway, 
here's the part I'd missed/forgotten; there is no evade skill, no evade 
button, rather, you turn off attack, hit sneak, and if you're lucky, the 
mob turns away to attack your buddy who is also right there hitting 
away.  Which doesn't matter much till 10th level, when you get backstab.

Yep, really seems that way, and its what everyone has told me as well.
