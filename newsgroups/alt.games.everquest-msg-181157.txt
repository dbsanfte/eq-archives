I'm with bigpond dialup and the connection is near perfect. I think
i've seen one single ping spike that lasted about 4 seconds in the
month or so i've been with them.

Before that I was with primus and they were really bad,  they would
ping spike about every ten minutes with lots of eq disconnections.

I also tried out an isp called nobbys/hotkey and they use the
comindico network and they were really good.

Anyway bigpond have excellent latency, and they have just increased
their download limits so they are pretty much in line with other isps
now.
