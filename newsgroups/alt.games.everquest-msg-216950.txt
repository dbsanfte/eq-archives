I've done about 4 or 5 LDON adventures so far (2 of which failed, but one
was due to the party falling apart DURING the mission), and in one of them I
was the only Int caster (High Elf Magician). The other groups either had a
Chanter or Necro along for the adventure.

I'm primarily doing adventures in Mistmoore Catacombs, but I'd also like to
do some in Tak. I have no real interest in grouping in the other dungeons,
because I'm saving up adventure points for particular items.

I was wondering if a group made up mostly of Int casters would work in LDON,
because I've been considering grouping with another Magician from my guild,
a Necro, and a Chanter, with a Paladin or SK and a Cleric filling out the
party.

Would this work, or would I be better off replacing the one of the Int
casters with another tank or a versatile class, like a Bard or BL?

What about a group made up of a Magician, a BL, a Shaman (high enough to
have their spirit wolf companion), a Necromancer, a Monk and a Paladin?

Incidentally, the only missions I've done with more than one of each class
in the group so far involved two Bards in one group and two Clerics in the
other, and I've never been in a group with more than two pets being used.
