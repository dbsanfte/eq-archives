san.. I'm man enough to admit when I'm wrong.  I should not have posted to
everquest about greeks_philosophizer's needless crossposting reply.  As we
mature we see our mistakes, we learn from them, and we move on.  I'll say my
apologies and restrict them to this group alone, thereupon I'll plonk you
for throwing your own hissy-fit (as it should be), and try to take what
knowledge I can from this experience to better my understanding of this
process that is Life.  That is the beauty of being a human being, that I can
grow and better myself...

...you on the other hand are a cross-posting dick.

Have a nice day  :)
