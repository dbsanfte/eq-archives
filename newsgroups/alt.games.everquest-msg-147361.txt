Why thank you.

Not only am I gleefully an Unamerican Fuck but I am also an Unaustralian
fuck as well. I have a brain and as faulty as it is it is still capable of
free and independant thought. I don't need news presenters, politicians or
mindless sock puppets telling me what I should think.

What do I think? Well, who cares? But if your particularily bored then see
if you can track down what Nelson Mandella is saying recently about US
foreign policy, he has pretty much the same opinion as me but of course says
it much more eloquently.
