Well, that's possible.  I've been around about two years
now, so "not long ago" could end up being like nine months
or so.  I'll try to scan my logs (all 380MB of them).

No, it was folks who had dueled in the Areana in Freeport,
and accidentally killed one of the "let's not duel to the
death, I'm bound far away" participants.  They had been
looking for a while a revive to save the guy a long trip back
before I eventually wandered through the zone and helped.

Again, I can't recall off the top of my head exactly how
long ago that was, though.

Ah... Clever, I hadn't thought of the "double application" method.
