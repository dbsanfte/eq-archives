I know this post is absolutely no use to you advice wise, but I just wanted
to tell ya about how much fun the nec is!  I made a Human necro too, I like
picking combo's that ain't 'the best possible', simply because I am awkward
LOL
Didn't bother twinking at all except buying those first spells, as I like a
challenge.  What can I say...  Great fun! lvl 8 to 12 were a bit slow, but
once I got the lvl 12 spells... total killin machine, very little down time
and still only got base INT as I aint spent any money on him yet.  If ya
looking for a solo character, that should have you grinning when you play..
you picked the right one : )
