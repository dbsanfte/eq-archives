Sounds pretty much right. This game is upgradeable to the point where
why have an EQ2 really? I think they probably plan to keep doing this
until no one wants to play while they make other "new"
products like SWG and planetside that fill other niches.

EQ has no real competition still and very high subscription numbers.
An EQ 2 would have to compete with SWG, Worlds of Warcraft, shadowbane
and even Everquest. It would take a long time to build content to the
EQ point.

Honestly what they should do is totally silently rebuild the old areas
of the game like freeport, neriak, etc over a period of like nine
months while optimizing/altering character and monster models then
spring the whole thing on us after a patch as a surprise and call it
EQ 2. It would be far easier than starting from scratch.
