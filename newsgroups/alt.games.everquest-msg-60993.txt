So I've been unable to log in to EQ today, starting to get the Patch Day
Jitters, only
worse, because there's no telling when things might get fixed.

I can get to character select, but from there always crash back to
server select instead of making it in to a world (tried MT repeatedly,
and Luclin a few times just to see if its Morel Thule at fault)

Checking in Chat, I finally found a GM on, who checked, both servers
running, at 1000 and 800 characters respectively.  Then he asked my
location, and checked up on a web site that is new to me,
http://www.internettrafficreport.com

Sure enough, there is a router down in PA, which apparantly is what is
keeping me out, my connection is bad enough that I'm getting dropped out
when trying to boot up large files like an EQ zone, while the more
limited communication needed for chat server is working fine... or now
that I pay attention, with some noticable lag.

So I've got a new bookmark site set up to help me diagnose my EQ woes...
but I'm thinking I may have to poke my head back out from under my
virtual reality rock and find something to do IRL for the day!
