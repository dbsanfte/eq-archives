As a follower of the EQ boards in order to get tips and learn the
lingo, I have paid particular interest to the Conquest incident.

I am a level 12 Human Magician on the Veeshan server.  I am still
learning.  And there are plenty of times when the dynamics of the game
are frustrating.

But after reading over a thousand posts on the subject of the Conquest
incident and my own incident from last night, I am at the the point
where I feel like I am in a Catch 22 that could easily be solved by
Verdant.

Last night, I was walking along the path in WC that leads from near
the zone from HHP/HK to the first inn on the shore of the lake.  I
could see the inn in the distance.  I had an earth pet with a burnout
spell on it.  I was buffed with my lesser shielding.  I decided to
unload some loot for cash and see if the inn was selling Krispy Kreme
donuts *G*.  It was nighttime and I am human so my eyesight was pretty
bad.

Out of nowhere, I am slapped down hard by a young kodiak.  No, make
that two young kodiaks.  Wait, maybe three.  The mob/s were
graphically overlayed and so I could not tell you if there were two or
three (one of the truly frustrating things about the game).  But I was
taking hits and trying to run like hell.  My pet (so loyal and true)
was dispatched within a few seconds.  Then, they turned to me.  I was
now at the inn and right at the shore of the lake.

So, I decided that maybe I should just jump into the lake (I am at 65
or 66 on my swimming) and hope they drown or can't swim.

Then, I stop.

In my mind, I am wrestling.  If I do jump into the lake, is that an
exploit?  I don't know.  And there is no place for me to find that
answer.  I didn't have the time to do a /shout in the zone asking for
info.  I didn't have time to search EQ boards or consult the EQ manual
that came with the software.

Considering the posts I have read and the general complaints about
Verdant CS and the GM's, I just decided to let myself die than risk
getting a "You have been summoned by the gods..." text rolling across
my screen or a "You are being warned..."  (Perhaps it is an
overimagined fear, but the reputation of GM's being fair and
understanding is cursory at best.)

Several young kodiaks strike me down.  The end.  Finis.  Applause.

I port back home, remem by spells and obtain my corpse, right there
just one step from the water.

Now, it is easy enough for someone to say, "Well, sure, you just jump
in the water."  And I would know that this was okay how?  From
everything I have read, it seems as though the "exploits" in the game
are understood on a trial-and-error basis.  Even in the text logs from
Conquest and the official statement by Verdant, the exploit is never
really spelled out.  There is vague language about z-axis and
exploting and misuse of CoH, etc.  I still don't know what they
specifically did wrong. (I would love to have seen the logs when the
first person "expolited" the pathing issue, not to mention his/her
reaction.)

I know that my incident was a minor issue.  I lost some exp and a pet.
 But there *has* to be a better way to deal with this than
trail-and-error.

But for me, at this point, I like EQ, but when it comes to the point
where I cannot have a website or guidebook that gives better rules
than a vague statement about not exploiting, I wonder when the game
will be more of a concern about trying not to piss off the GM's than
trying to take down the Sleeper.

If that happens, then it stops being a game and starts being a monthly
fee trying to avoid the wrath of the gods.  Not a game I am
particularly interested in playing.
