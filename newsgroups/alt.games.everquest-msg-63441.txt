As mentioned before, The Hole is very buggy when it comes to /con.  In that
zone you can pretty much just ignore it altogether.  Either you're attacked
or you're not.

Ratmen and undead will kill a Halfling rogue who worships Brell, and they
won't see through rogue invis.  I know that said rogue is KOS to Yael, but I
don't happen to know if he sees through sneak/hide (rogue invis).
