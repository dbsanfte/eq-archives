Going in a blowing up a residence and totally impoversing a family is a form
of terror.

Terrorism is just another form of war. And weather you call it evil or
patriotic depends on which side you sit on.

War is an extension of Politics.  Terrorism, is a "poor mans war."  People,
called civilians or "women & children" die in a war/terrorist attacks

Was it Terror when M. Begin bombed the King David Hotel in 1947?
Was it Terror when the US CIA fire bombed Guatemala City in order to depose
the government?
Was operation Phoenix in Vietnam a form of Terror?
Was the massacre in Lebanon a form of Terror?

They are both stuck in a spiral, and are both too close to the problem to be
able to think of a rational solution.
