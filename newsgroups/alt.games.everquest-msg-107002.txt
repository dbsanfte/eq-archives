He run around like that a lot then? ;) I was wondering if he had
something like that graphicless tunic from SG that one of our (female
dark elf) rogues is running around with.
(Tell him "hubba hubba" from me, btw :p)

So, where does it come from?

I still have the gnomeskin tunic and legs in my bags for Trak raids,
but will sell them off as soon as I can justify it.

Aren't parrying daggers fun? I sometimes consider making myself a
forged bastard sword, and my baby warrior is using a parrying dagger
to work on bashing (lighter than most shields and has let her dual
wield since way before 13 :) )

Go ahead and let me know where to look :) (I'd kinda like it if I
didn't have to sift through your entire diaries, though ;) )

I'll have to get some new pics of my own soon - got leafy sparklies
last night after the quickest and most efficient Faydedar raid I have
ever seen. We were 17 people, no ench or shaman, and we smoked him :)
