I don't think so.

They give out more options, to encourage a more
diverse set of people, and hopefully, more people
in total.

Simple concept.

Where, exactly do I say that the game WOULD be
"all things"

Try to be exact.

You said "...such a game would be far from all
things"

I complained, with justification, that I did not
say that it WOULD be "all things", only that Sony
might "... hope to become "all things to all
people"".

Can you really not see the difference?

One is a prediction, the other is a guess as to
what Sony might believe.

Its nice for you to be one of the normal, non
mentally challenged people, who have the stout
heart, and a bottomless well of bravery, to play
the game 'as it should be played', but you aren't
the only one with dollars. And, if Sony can get
twice the amount of dollars from the mentally
challenged, as they can from normal, uber-ordinary
people like you, they may well to decide they
don't give a fuck about you, no matter how huge
and intelligent your brain is.

Did you mistype here?

After all, the metaphor is almost correct.

Did you mean step-up to high class hooker from
cheap whore?

No. You lose out. Unless your definition of gamer
is 'people like me'.

The "key to success", as I see it, is to enjoy
oneself in a game.

What do you see as the "key to success"

> Of course not being much of a gamer

If you mean "not being much of a gamer", as not
being able to spend more than a couple of hours
per week playing a video game, then I have to
plead guilty. 

> I guess such a world appeals to you.

Your guesses are even less accurate than your
comprehension, impossible as that seems.

Despite me repeatedly saying I don't believe that
selling pre-made characters would be a good idea,
you persist with watery attacks, trying to claim
the opposite. 

The problem is that UO has already brought in
pre-made characters. I am suggesting that EQ, and
all similar games will do likewise, sooner or
later. I'm simply informing you of what will
happen. Now you could accuse me, with some degree
of justification, of being a Jeremiah, but you
have let your petty spite lead you into believing
I am Judas.

I want to hate the idea as much as you, but I
can't find a well thought out argument, or in your
case, any argument at all, to persuade me. All I
have is a gut feeling, whereas I suspect all you
have is a gut.

> /spits

This, at least, seems to have more substance than
any of your previous anaemic diatribes.

Spoonfeeding time again;

The same way that doctors go on, knowing they
cannot cure every person of their ills.

Perhaps the dollars might console them.

Exactly.
