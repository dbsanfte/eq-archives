     The original poster's character needs invis to get from
SH to SV - he's not one of the "level 1 characters" I was talking
about, and thus really doesn't belong there. In fact, there are 
quite a few race/class combinations that have trouble making the 
trip. Truthfully, I can't think of one that could solo it easily, but
then, I don't have years of experience with the game.

     I do know that I am sick of the low-level Dark Elves in 
Shar Val - they SHOULD NOT be able to make the trip. As for the
rest of them: if you need invis to get to Luclin and are still in 
single-digit levels, STAY HOME. ]:P
