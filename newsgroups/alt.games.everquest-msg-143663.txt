}You're a warrior.  You want high AC.  And lots of hit points.

Ok, I forgot to mention haste, because I figured it's probably out of your 
budget.  But get a haste item, it makes a huge difference in your ability 
to taunt.  Haste and regen are probably the only things worth sacrficing 
AC for, but regen is probably out of your price range for a long time.  
Also, get a -good- haste item, there are a lot of fairly fugly ones out 
there like sporali gloves, but if you see a really good deal on them, it 
beats nothing.

But get yourself a piece of banded or ringmail or whatnot in every slot, 
first.  Even if it leaves you weilding the Tarnished Broadsword of 
N00bness.  You're a warrior and you will be grouping, your goal is to keep 
the monster hitting you and take the damage.  Actually killing it is the 
rest of the group's problem.
