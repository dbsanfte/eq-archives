The commercial is pretty lame.  I wonder if Verant is going for different
audience?  I found a website once (http://www.nickyee.com/eqt/report.html),
that had survey results on Everquest.  I think I found it here, as a matter
of fact.  According to that website the average age for an Everquest player
was over 25.

The commercial makes it look like they are going for a younger audience.
