I'm not sure AT actually does anything

My level 22 warrior went from AT 0 to AT 115 (it IS level capped) in one
session... took 4 backpacks of Vodka :o)

I kept him perma-drunk throughout, and kept an eye on his stats as his AT
skill built, and there was no change in max Str gained, or min Int/Wis/ATK
lost.

there might be some benefit with a REALLY high AT skill (180+) but there's
no change at lower levels.

... and being drunk enough to see a bonus to Str, means your ATK is too low
to hit anything... just ask the Caiman that nearly ate my Warr :o)
