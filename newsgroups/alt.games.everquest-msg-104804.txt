	No, this is mathematical sophistry.

	The *total damage* dealt by the fighters over the course of a fight with a
raid-level mob is high.  The *DPS* is low, compared to the DPS of a caster.

	I did 11.8K damage to Taskmaster Abyyot recently, compared to 11.6K from
the Wizard who was present.  But she did her damage in seconds, while I had to
first burn through Trueshot (just over 4K damage) and then melee for a couple
of more minutes for the rest.  (And the Wizard might have done better; she
used Lures at first because she thought he was highly resistant, which he
isn't.)

	The last time I parsed my DPS it was around 50, with ENC/SHM buffs and
fighting low-mid blues.  It might have gone up a little since I have gained
levels since then, but not very much; I'm still using the epics (and probably
will for the rest of my playing career).  Casters deal *hundreds* of DPS,
easily.

|Yep.

	By acknowledging these points you are conceding the argument.  No, you may
not have caster classes that can both grind EP better than fighters and are
more valuable on raids as well.
