Good job ignoring the interface improvements, the new zones, the new
spells, the new continents, the new weapons, and the new races.

But then, if you were to acknowledge those, it would wreck your point,
wouldn't it?

You keep attributing the changes to fear. No one is saying that
constant improvement of the product isn't being done to keep ahead of
the competition. But that's not fear - that's just how business works.
Every business that wants to stay in business constantly improves its
products.
