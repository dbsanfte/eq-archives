Point one was that Warriors need modifying to make them the preferred Tank
Class for EXPing groups.  Knights may get bent out of shape over this but
the Warrior class is broken when it comes to tanking POP mobs.  I lay the
blame for this directly at the feet of the developers.  I only mentioned the
soloing part because Warriors can NEVER solo reliably.  I know that you now
have Temperance that can easily get melees through their low levels but that
one buff aside, Warriors grow up being parts of a group.  (Having done my
pre-30 levels back in 2001 I did not have the chance to use the 800 HPs
Temperance buff.)  Then to have that role as Tank taken away by Knights once
they hit their 50s shows that the developers screwed up with POP.

Knights need not be nerfed.  The Warriors just need to be fixed.(Allow Taunt
to land 90% of the time and have a Warrior only hate bonus of 25-50 points
per successful Taunt)  Do not make this some stupid AA.  Just give it to
Warriors once they hit level 53.

And your last comment shows your complete lack of knowledge of the Healing
classes.  At level 39, Clerics get Complete heal that can restore a maximum
of 7500 HPs at a mana cost of 400.  A Druid gets a 75% heal (Maximum 2925
Hps) at level 58 that costs 400 mana and must wait until level 64 to get
Karana's Renewal which is a 75% heal (4680 Maximum HPs) and costs 600 Mana.
So your comment "Druids got Complete Heals some time ago.  Clerics were
hardly made obsolete." shows your ignorance.
