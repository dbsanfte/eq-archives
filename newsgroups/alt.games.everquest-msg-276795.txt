I died a lot.  Up to about level 15, I soloed endlessly in the Commonlands.  Then I did a
few levels near the Windmill in Lake of Ill Omen (there would be 130+ peeps in the
zone!!).  Around 18 or so I moved across the lake and camped the 4 pillars (which would
later become the Veksar marker).  Occasionally I would get into a Sarnak fort group.
Around 26 I graduated to Frontier Mountains and Overthere.  I started soloing in
Dawnshroud Peaks around 32.  Did a few levels on the Crazed Ghoul in Butcherblock
somewhere in there.  Did some Ogre soloing in RM, too.  Around 45 or so I started soloing
skellies in the Combine City, and near the Firiona Vie zoneline in Dreadlands - kept that
up into my 50s.  Did a little work in Burning Wood and Great Divide until 56.  Went to 60
on Grieg's End, Plane of Innovation, and Plane of Justice.

I remember shock and awe at the sight of the moon rising over North Ro.

I remember taking a big roundabout through Antonica at level 11:
WFP>EFP>NRO>OASIS>SRO>IS>FEE>RM>LR>SK>NK>EK>HH>KITH>WC>EC>WFP .
I had a puckered asshole the whole way.

I remember massive Sarnak trains in LoIO.

I remember killing Lucan D'Lere the dangerous, old-school way, using a root-hail to hold
him at the EC zoneline.

I remember my first Ragefire battle!  WHOO HOO there be dragons here!

A little of both.  I did not want to sacrifice my enjoyment of the game environment purely
for the sake of leveling...but when grinding was called for, I could do it as hard as the
next guy.
