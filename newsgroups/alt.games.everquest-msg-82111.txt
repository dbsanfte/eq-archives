I too feel your pain, if you want real pain try playing a hight
impaired character that MUST jump to get on the boat at FP, atleast 1
time out of every 5 I miss the boat cause I fall in the water.  I've
riden baots all over EQ  (except Kunark) and this is the only
dock/boat location that I have to leap to get on a boat.  What gives?

Between your "sleep walking" and my leaping boat travel sucks.
