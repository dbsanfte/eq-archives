Well in about another years (maybe just under) time AMD will have thier
Hammer line of chips out and they should have SSE2 support, that will be
around the time that people will have finally gotten around to optimizing
thier code for SSE2. The Current Athlon XPs already have SSE optimization
which is far more widespread.

Personally I would like to see more optimizations done on the vidcard side.
I wish they would code the models to take advantage of the Radeon 8500's
truform features. It could really help make those models a bit more smoother
and realistic.
