Well, that's why you have a guild.  It only takes one person to see 
Ragefire up in Skyfire, then the rest of the guild can get to the nearest 
port spot and be there, buffed and killing in 5 minutes.
I much prefer FCFS over lists.  (Clerics that bring a group and camp his 
spawn point are given a LOT of time to get the rest of their force there.  
If they die though, he's free to kill.)
