In reality no it cant since there is no violation of the user
agreement. See it has already been established that unless the network
itself is under license then no agreement can extend to other
computers running on a network that is not running the licensed
software( US vs Microsoft). Since EQ runs on a public network there is
no violation of license. This however would be little consolation to
me if banned cause I wouldn't sue them anyway. However there is
nothing Verant can do to PROVE IN COURT a person is running showeq
since its totally passive, so they would prob find some other reason
to ban you. Heh unless they were really really stupid and in that case
clean their clocks in court and more power to ya.

As for cheating the attraction of showeq for many is the gratification
of the hacker gene that always pushes a person to see how something
REALLY works. I run packet sniffers all the time on my network just to
see what's going on, is that cheating? Nope. Is that a violation of
law? Nope. 

Oh and BTW invisible mobs will agro on you even without running
showeq, happened twice to us once resulting in a wipe out, now that
friend is some lame assed crap. 

And no I don't run it but if I do it would be out of curiosity more
than anything else. Or to protect myself from some of the petty tricks
a GM might pull.
