In the words of Emily Litella, "never mind..."

For details, see my other reply in this thread, but I
just wanted to announce that one of my assumptions in
my "bug report" was wrong (due to undocumented game
behavior concerning KoS merchants), and thus my
"proof" fails and the Mozo bone chip quest is probably
working as advertised after all.

But the effort was not a total waste.  It helped to
verify a lot of the information in the following table,
which has been floating around the EQ community for
a while:

    [Assuming "Indifferent" starts at an arbitrary 0]:
    -xxx to -751    ...scowls at you, ready to attack
    -750 to -501    ...glares at you threateningly
    -500 to -101    ...glowers at you dubiously
    -100 to   -1    ...looks your way apprehensively
       0 to   99    ...regards you indifferently
     100 to  499    ...judges you amiably
     500 to  749    ...kindly considers you
     750 to +xxx    ...looks upon you warmly

Furthermore, I've verified the bit of EQ conventional wisdom
that says that factions max out at +2000 points over base.
Sure enough, my Trooper faction stalled the instant I had
done 2000 faction-raising acts.  (Still to be verified is
the belief that factions have a "floor" of -3000 points
below base.)

I've *ALSO* debunked the rumor that getting killed by an
NPC on a given faction resets your base figure.  I got killed
by the Troopers a couple of times during this quest (when the
Crusaders aggroed on me and the Troopers pitched in to help)
after I was already 1500 or more points "up" on their faction
list, and yet even so my Trooper faction stalled out right
on schedule when I had racked up exactly 2000 lifetime
faction increases with them.

And I'm still going to send Verant some form of the
following suggestion from my original "bug report":

# Furthermore, for ALL faction quests (and faction-
# producing kills), it would be really nice if
# a maxed faction did not produce a "has gotten
# better" message, but instead would say, "your
# faction standing with XXX can not go any higher",
# or some similar message (and a related message
# for a faction that is at rock-bottom).
#
# It's really frustrating to have spent a lot of
# time working on a faction quest, when in fact
# it stopped producing results days ago, but the
# game never actually bothered to tell you...
