   Well, not everyone feels as strongly about it as all
that.  And not everyone feels the urge to killfile anyone
that states an opinion that is different than their own.  
Sheesh, Tyger, did you spend a few a your past live
persecuting heretics in the middle ages?  
    I feel pretty neutral about buying and selling stuff.  I
know it's against Verant's policy and rules.  I think it
probably causes more problems than it's worth.  I'd don't
really enjoy grouping with a level 19 warrior in full crusty
who's constantly bragging about how uber he is and how the
the party's other tank sucks because of his crappy
equipment.  But that sort of problem would remain whether he
bought the stuff on player's auctions or was decked out by
his brother's level 60 druid.
