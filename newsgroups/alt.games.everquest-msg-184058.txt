In that case, I have a two word answer to your question: Good judgement.

Everyone has the basic abilty to make decisions.  Some, however, are flaming
morons, and their judgement is on par with my singing ability.  Those who
take the time to learn from their mistakes, and to learn how to make good
decisions (yes, it is something that can be learned to at least a moderate
degree), can begin to exhibit what we call good judgement.  Just like a
golfer must learn the fundamentals of her swing, or the runner must learn
how to properly pace himself, the decision-maker must understand how to set
priorities, and quickly balance risk and reward, advances and setbacks.
That takes time to learn, and is very much a skill.
