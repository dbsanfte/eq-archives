I've played EQ for many years and tried EQ2, far too much of a
knock-off imo.  If you want something new, get something new.  EQ2 is
not new.

I think you underestimate the differences between VG and EQ, they are
pretty vast.
Crafting?  Hands down VG has it over EQ and EQ2.
Diplomacy?  The EQ's do not have this concept, and it's quite
entertaining.
Adventuring?  EQ still owns this imo.  EQ2 kinda sucked comparitively,
I like VG better than EQ2.
