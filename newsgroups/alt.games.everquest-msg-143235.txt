Quite important. Definitely install them.

Good.

This is a good idea to do, even if it is a pain in the arse. Usually you 
have to boot to DOS to do it. Check www.bootdisk.com to make a DOS 
bootdisk to do this with.

I hate this feature. I just load Windows Update manually. I also hate it 
how it does not allow you to download each patch and store it away 
seperately to patch other PCs or for your next reinstall. Just install 
the critical stuff which is relevant, don't bother with the latest Media 
Player or Internet Explorer.

This means you are using ACPI, since IRQ 16 does not exist, its just 
ACPI pretending it does. Check what your BIOS boot screen shows when it 
lists what PCI devices it detects. It will list IRQs being used there. 
Also check under device manager in Windows. Click View, Resources by 
connection. This will show a list of devices by IRQ use.

If you are not using your Firewire controller then try disabling this in 
  Device Manger. Also disable this USB controller if you are not using 
it either.

If you are not using this Promise controller then disable this too. You 
will need to check whether you are using the VIA HDD controller or this 
controller for your HDD.

Strange it reports this when you are obviously using ACPI. You can 
verify this by going into device manager. It should list a "Computer" 
device and under that it should list "Advanced Configuration and Power 
Interface (ACPI) PC"
