Naaah, the built-in hard disk controller is kinda nifty to have, as
well as the memory, PCI and AGP bus architecture. I also like the
built-in PS/2 ports, so I can actually use the thing.

Built in video, sound and network card (ethernet, isdn, modem,
etc...), you're better off buying those separately. Much easier to
upgrade.

as for built in IDE RAID controller, well, I'm not sure about that.
If it is done right, I'd take one.
