Now that I know that ID actually works at some point ::points to your 
other post:: that makes sense.  As someone else mentioned, with Tae, I 
was seeing the occasional proc against greenies, and NOTHING against 
anything even light blue.

At worst, it's a lot better solution than a certain other person's yes-
I-expected-it "get a fungi".

Erg.  I'd noticed the ability to do that when farming faction on the EC 
orcs, but I didn't really want to run around testing it on the nearest 
drachnid :p

Of course, now that I've chucked Tae, I can drag him out and practice on 
him.  Hmmmm...
