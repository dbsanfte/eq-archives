As a monk who 3-boxes a slower and a CH'er...

Snare is powerful, and, though I can't even begin to count the times I wish
I had the ability, the lack of it very seldom stopped me from accomplishing
something.  Root is just as powerful and possessed by a lot more classes,
even if it is generally a less savory alternative.

That said, I have the monk snare AA and consider it a great tool even with
its harsh restrictions (very short duration, only useable once a minute,
eats endurance that would otherwise be used for damage output, and mobs can
"dodge" it), as well as having carried a snare-proccing weapon in the past.

Snare could be removed from the game and the only type of play that would be
completely eliminated is snare kiting.  Everything else would go on with
minimal change.
