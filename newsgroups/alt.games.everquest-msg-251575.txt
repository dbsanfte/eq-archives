But unfortunately that is how EQ is meant to be played. The vast 
majority of quests are not solvable in game. Many tradeskills are 
largely not solvable in game. It requires considerable collaboration on 
the part of players to sort it out. This collaboration invariably 
manifests itself as spoilers.

If you disagree, consider the newbie armour. Several of them require 
highly rare items, with no clue as to what mob they drop from. To do 
them, without spoilers, is insantity. You would easily green out every 
single mob ages before completing it. Hell, even with spoilers, you 
can't finish several of them before the mobs green out.

At higher levels where the quests start spanning multiple zones, you 
could literally spend months looking for the right type of goblin to 
kill to get the X. And if, without spoilers, you do find the right type 
of goblin, and you kill him 20 times without getting the X... you are 
seriously going to think the quest is broken, or that you are on the 
wrong mob after all, and give up.

Worse, other than buying crap out of the bazaar, if you don't have the 
spoilers, and just level following the advice of ooc 'where do i go now' 
in pok... you will hit 50th level in 15th level armour, maybe some 
fungal fiend flesh stuff from paludal caverns, a junky weapon, less than 
half your spells... which only serves to make buying pp and using it on 
bazaar gear more attractive.

Using the spoilers is the *only* way for a new player to actually make 
any gear progress. Its easy to level in EQ now, too easy even, but 
locating level appropriate gear (other than ldon stuff) without farming 
spider silk for the bazaar is harder than its ever been. The quests and 
drops are just as slow, but you level so much faster.

Once upon a time 3 friends could do lambent+darkforge+totemic while 
leveling up... but now if those three started on the darkforge at 25, 
the group could easily be 30 before its done, and then the the lambent 
would take them to 35+... by the time they finished the totemic the 
shaman would have gained 15 levels... and the totemic would be pretty 
obsolete... *and* that's if they use spoilers and go to each camp, get 
the item, and move to the next one without getting distracted for a day 
or two going to kunark or ldon or luclin or gunthak or velious...and 
picking up a few extra levels there... or god forbid heading to frenzied 
room to get a fbss...where they could easily gain another level or 2. Of 
course, without spoilers, how would they ever find that camp in the 
first place, or know that it was worth spending hours on end camping it 
to get what drops there.

Taking 20 levels to get equipped in armour that was level appropriate 
when you *started* it is ridiculous.

And if they tried to solve the quests on their own, they'd be 50 plus 
(or stuck in their forties because everything had long since 
lightblued/greened out and the xp was terrible).
