/agree

I also think that they are trying to keep long term players who may be
burning out interested. I know that I would have quit by now if some
of the recent changes hadn't revitalized the game for me.

All of the recent changes (Server Xfers, Legends, fast levels 1-10,
revamped newbie areas, Name Change services, etc, etc) are more of a
perk to long term players than true newbies. A true EQ newbie won't
know enough to be excited about (or turned off by) these changes..

Look at how quickly they are turning out expansions.....The time span
between Release-->Kunark was much longer than
Kunark-->Velious.....Velious-->SoL was shorter, and Planes of Power is
coming directly on the heals of SoL. The pattern is obvious. Long term
players devour content so quickly that Verant has to release
expansions (not to mention patches, like the recent pet changes) at a
faster pace to keep people playing.

With 400K+ subscribers the "impossible" can become possible. Before
offering the service there has to be enough demand (eq money to be
made) to make it worth while to Verant.

I can see where you are coming from, but I am not bothered about it as
much as you are. I see it as part to the maturation process. EQ was
doomed before the first line of code was written. As much as I love
the game, that is just the way things are. PC games have a limited
life span. The decline of EQ is inevitable. Hopefully we can all find
reasons to enjoy the game despite the changes that do more harm than
good.

At some point something new/better will come along (most likely EQ2),
and most of us will migrate over. Then the cycle will start again.
