If you're that fast a typist, maybe you should try properly reading
what you're replying to before you start?

FYI, the line you missed this time was (paraphrased) "use hotkeys
while typing out lines". Should I presume you do that by writing '/gu
And one time, at band camp232 damn'?

You see, the REASON it takes me a moment to remember I can click them
to activate them is that I know exactly what the keyboard numbers do
with hotkeys and use them ALL the time, to the extent that I 'forget'
about their clickability. (Oh yeah, and I cast spells with the alt
keys, too. Amazing, innit?)
