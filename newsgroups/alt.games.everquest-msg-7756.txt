Try malise, my earth pets roots about 75% of the time.  In addition the attempt
to root some one is a good taunt.  I have found that earth pets are better if
you are soloing, but the water/fire pets are good for a group.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind.
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
