ROFLMAO.

Lawyers don't decide what is legal. Lawyers argue about what is legal. 
If corporations had lawyers that could actually ensure a contract was 
enforceable there'd be far less corporate lawsuits because everyone 
would know before filing the suit that the contract would be found 
enforceable.

Lawyers can test each clause for the existence of what they beleive is 
relevant precedent or actual legislation to support it, and give an 
estimation of how defensible the contract is, but that is it.

However in many MMOG EULAs the clauses are a bit of a stretch from 
existing precedent and legislation. 

Laywers can't assure blizzard that the EULA will hold until its tested 
clause by clause in court.

Further, significant chunks of the EULA are likely not enforceable, and 
the strategy is probably to put them in anyway, hope the average person 
just follows them, and if anyone does challenge it, dodge a court battle 
with a quick private settlement. 

Because, as we've discussed here countless times in the past, the courts 
are too great a gamble. And if the EULA is struck down then there may be 
widespread ramifications, and they don't want to take the risk.

An example of a clause that I beleive is not likely enforceable is the 
clause that prevents a parent from buying the game for his 2 underage 
sons to share. According the EULA the parent must purchase 2 copies of 
the game and subscribe to 2 accounts if he wants to allow both kids to 
play, even if he only has one PC. I highly doubt the courts would side 
with SOE on that one.
