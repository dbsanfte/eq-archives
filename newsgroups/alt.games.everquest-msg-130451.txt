This kind of daft argument can just as easily justify quite a few
of the Palestinian suicide bombings. After all they must have blow
up somewhere in which an Israeli solider might have been at one time
or other. You could probably even stetch it far enough to cover
the WTC.

But it's just not PC to use this kind of thing to justify anything
other than Israeli (and possibly US, possibly even someone Israel
or the US happens to like right now.)

More double standards from the support Israel whatever crowd.

Fairer maybe, certainly not fair. That would take another $20,000,000,000

Which soon leads to "we do something it's ok, they do something very
much the same and it's bad".
