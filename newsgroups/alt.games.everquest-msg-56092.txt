Verant you suck.  Geez, grow up.  Try making an SK and a Warrior of the same
race, and compare the HP.    A warrior of the same race starts out with 5
higher stamina, and has 5 more bonus points to put in the character.  This
will cause that warrior to have higher HP potential.  You could still dump
all your warrior bonus points into something other than STA, and then dump
all your bonus points on your SK into STA, and the SK will have higher HP.
So what?  And, yes, a Ogre SK will have higher HP than just about any
warrior of other races, but that is just a racial thing.
