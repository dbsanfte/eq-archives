I have a somewhat different version of this same problem; I level up to 
65, then I start over with something new

Since this is much slower, I only have 2 level 65s (cleric and mage) and 
some other characters abandoned at somewhat lower levels; a 57 bard, a 
52 shaman.

I did this with one of my original characters in a more advanced form, 
quitting the game and selling (I know, I know) the account when I topped 
out my 50 cleric...

While I have played almost every class and race (not all potential 
combos, just samples) to at least 20, and several up to their 30s, its 
rarely as an Alt; I usually commit to a character fairly completely 
(even if I don't intend to), abandoning my old "main" in favor of this 
new one... I have on occaision switched back to a former main which 
hadn't topped out on levels yet, but rarely played anything as a true alt.

Exception being my little druid, which I deliberately leveled up to 29 
so as to be able to port my friends around, in particular one friend I 
played with constantly had a druid main, but was playing a monk alt; she 
could port my cleric somewhere and then I could log in my druid and port 
her monk so we could play together.  Then the Nexus came out and that 
was no longer very important (POK just drove the stake thru the heart, 
it was Nexus that took most of the reason for a port whore out of the 
game)  I did end up leveling the druid to 34 just fooling around with 
his 29 spells... but never really treated him as a main.
