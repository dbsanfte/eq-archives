Yes you are correct.  I believe that twinking is wrong, therefore it
is my position that others shouldnt do it, and I shall say as much.

Irrelevant.

Hearing the voices again Biz?

How people feel is irrelevant to what my opinion is and whether I am
allowed or choose to express it.

>(although it sounds like it might only get you through the fifth grade)...

What button was that supposed to push Biz?  Just curious so I can send
in a bug report since it didnt work.

Oh, I am well aware of that.  In fact, I accept the fact that the
MAJORITY dont feel as I do about twinking.  Be that as it may, I will
still openly voice my opinion, and tell what I think about topics that
come up that I feel strongly about.  

Sounds to me like you are just as guilty of the "concrete head"
syndrome as you claim I am.  The only difference is which side of the
block we see out of=)
