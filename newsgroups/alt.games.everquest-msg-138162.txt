}Terms like this are "psychobabble".  You either love them and thrive on them

}are vile beasts which should be banished from the world (like others).

Hmm, well, what if I feel like they're vile beasts that need to be tamed a 
bit before I let them in the kitchen for a dish of milk? :)

}In this setting "self-actualization" refers to a situation where your baser
}needs (food, shelter, warmth, sex) are met, where you're more complex needs
}(self-esttem, trust) are met, and you have a full understanding of your
}niche in the society around you, as well as how you impact and are impacted
}by society.  

Now hang on, that's kinda circular... It sounds like you're defining the 
result of the process in terms of the prcess that leads to it.   But what 
exactly is it that's supposed to theoretically -happen- when they reach 
that level?

}IMO no one ever fully reaches this level.

Heh, I have a feeling that would explain a lot.  Like the prominent 
public success of some folks who obviously aren't even close.  Or at 
least, don't appear close to me. :) Like all the rock bands that make it 
big and then explode in a serious bout of drug overdoses.

}> }I'm not intending to be bigoted, but if you do some research you will

}> It souds a bit odd to me.  I'm looking at the pyramid thingy at the

}Unfortunately, as is the nature with many aspects of the social sciences,
}something like this is very very very difficult to test empirically.  There
}have been many correlational studies done which indicate that those who have
}committed serious crimes (rape, murder) tend to have fewer of their baser
}needs met.  There have also been correlational studies done which seem to
}indicate that those individuals who have made great advances in science,
}medicine, business, etc tend to have more of the baser needs met.
}"Self-actualization" is not a quantifiable state in an empirical nature.

Well, that sounds lke a step toward it being.  If we can correlate 'makes 
a great advance' with 'self-actualized', then we can at least assign it a 
value of 0 or 1. :)

}Kohlberg (the name I couldn't remember earlier) developed a system of moral
}development (http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/kohlberg.html).  It's premise is
}similar to Maslow in that if basic human needs are not met, and individual
}cannot progress to higher levels of consciousness and understanding of the
}world around one's self.

Lol!  That's actually really funny... I wouldn't have thought to link 
these two theories.  But the reason it's really funny is I read your 
article, and wandered off to the cafe for a soda pop, and was thinking 
about the bit a while back when we were talking about how young a kid you 
could reasonably teach 'the tolerance aspect of HIV' to, and was 
thinking... wasn't there a theory (about like Kohlberg's here, although I 
was thinking it was Piaget... did he have a similar moral development 
pathway?) that we could use to fgure out a realistic lower bound for when 
'don't beat up the smaller, weaker kid, he may be more fun to play with' 
could be taught?  It seems, now that I have the theory in front of me, 
(thank you), like teaching that lesson should be an approachable task 
fairly independent of the moral perspective attained, though, so perhaps 
it doesn't help.  But it's still funny as heck that you'd refer me 
directly to that little lost bit of theory I was thinking of within about 
an hour. :)

}> }Perhaps if prejudices and other such obstacles were removed (rather than
}> }utilized as a defense) the negative actions would also cease?
}> I'm a bit confused by what the 'negative actions' are? It seems clear in
}> the substance abuse case TwoHead suggests, but going back to the original
}> topic a bit, would that be like Mr. Wizzard's concern about PDA's in the
}> workplace?  Or am I trying to apply it to something it doesn't apply to?
}"negative actions" in this setting would be more along the lines of crimes.
}PDA's, provided they are not disruptive to others, would not be negative.

Well, I think we've established that the PDA's would be disruptive to Mr. 
Wizzard pretty thoroughly. :) 

}Further, IMO Maslow would think along the lines that if the basic needs of
}love, sex, and self-esteem were being met, such things as overt PDA's would
}not be necessary.

Hmm... I mostly buy that.  I suspect a lot of people really enjoy PDAs 
though (exhibitionism), so I'm not sure how that fits in with 'necessary'.
Or is experiencing enjoyment necessarily fulfilling a need?

}> I guess mainly I'm not more than 50%ish clear how this applies, and
}> secondarily, I wanna see the numbers that back it up.  Can ya help me?
}Can't really give you numbers.  I can give you links to some further studies
}along these lines, and some readings I really enjoyed on them.  They're all
}in that "psychobabble" language though.  I just tell DH to treat it the way
}I treat his "geek speak".  He talks about his ROM and DIM and stuff, and I
}talk about self-actualization and perceptive reasoning.

Links good.  Me like links. :)  I dunno DH, or how you treat DH's geek 
speak, so the metaphor is lost on me.  I'm hoping it's not 'let it fly 
over my head without trying to understand it', or I'm hosed. :)
