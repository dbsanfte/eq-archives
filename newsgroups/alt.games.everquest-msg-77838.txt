Well right now, I am lvling the monk with the lvl 35 druid (the druid keeps
him healed and buffed and the monk solo's). Right now the monk has no
problems soloing reds (been soloing FM from lvl 20). I the monk is overly
twinked (black pantherskin bp and legs, alternate a fungi, primitive leather
gloves, 6ac 65hp rings, hardend clay bracer, nathsar arms and bracer,
shissar headband, orc fang earrings, runed lava pendant, goranga idol, jade
mace, stave of shielding, and a sarnak hide mask). So to kill two birds with
one stone, lvl the druid with the monk as soon as the monk hits 35.
