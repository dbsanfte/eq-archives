What were those people wary of? That she might be a CIA agent preparing 
to overthrow Tony Blair? I lived in the US for five years, I had the 
time of my life, I made lots of American friends, and I have brought 
them over and showed them around Europe. I've never found anybody ever 
being "wary" of Americans. You may get the odd idiot who is rude out of 
stupidity, or political cluelessness, but even if the majority of the 
European population oppose the war, I don't think Americans would find 
themselves any less welcome here.

Agreed.

Hm. I think you are taking it a wee bit too far there. If you were 
talking about WWI, I may concede your point, but WWII had a great deal 
to do with one Mr. Adolf Hitler being stark raving nuts, whether 
Lebensraum was his immediate excuse or not.
