I know the difference between Poles, poles, and polls. The mangitude
of error between screwing up thoughts, SHadowhaven, and other errors
pales in comparison to know the difference between a Easter European
from Poland, a long wood or metal shaft, or a survey of people who
play EQ.

I do screw up the second cap all the time, it is because I have nerve
damage (from swordfighting) on the left hand which makes the ring
finger and pinky numb. I am an engineer which explains my spelling,
but alas that doesn't excuse my poor use of spelling.

It detracted from my point that EQ is being killed by "ease of play",
when it really needs better AI, and more interesting content. I am
beginning to think that all the new players coming into the game are
going to be the type who read the spoilers first, then step through
the motions.
