[SNIP]

In the first case, the *GUIDE* (please note the difference between GMs
and Guides, It's rather large. Guides are players who volunteer to
help the GMs. GMs are paid, trained employees of Verant) was
misinformed. /report does nothing to prove a KSing issue. The ONLY way
that anything can be done about a KSer is if they're caught in the act
(guide/GM in "stealth" mode watching the incident). Usually a KSer
won't steal more than a couple kills knowing this.

However, I have seen guides appear and deal with a KSer in the act
before, so it does happen. It's just something that is hard to catch.
The only way to get solid proof is to catch them, and without solid
proof there's nothing that can be done. Think about it. If they made
it so that /petitions were all that was needed, a group would be able
to /petition someone for KSing just to get back at them for
namecalling.
