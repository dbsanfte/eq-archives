I haven't played Everquest in over 3 years now.  I've been getting the
MMORPG bug again, and I've had a few recent (but dissapointing)
excursions into the realms of Anarchy Online and Earth and Beyond. 
Anarchy Online felt like a dead, abandoned world and Earth and Beyond,
well it just sucked.

So, this brings me back to Everquest... One of the things I liked
about Everquest was that the world was alive and I could count on
seeing the same faces pop up again and again.  I eventually grew tired
of the leveling tedium and moved on, but there are days when I
definitely regret it.

Now, my question is, how much has the game changed in the last few
years?  Keep in mind I *NEVER* played any of the expansion packs. 
Have the graphics been updated for all realms (not just the expansion
pack realms) or would the old haunts like Faydark still look the same
as they did 5 years ago?  Is there a good community of lower level
characters (keep in mind, I would probably have to start from level 0
since my old characters are probably long since gone)?  Have the
questing and story aspects of EQ been improved or are they still
somewhat lackluster?

I guess this is a really open ended question, and it's meant to be. 
I'm going to give Asheron's Call 2 and Eve Online (when it comes out)
a stab, but EQ may very well be the one I end up coming back to if the
others don't pan out (if for no other reason than the vibrant
community it has to offer).
