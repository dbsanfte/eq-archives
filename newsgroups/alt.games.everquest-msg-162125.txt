After the legends service and the POP release that allowed people to buy
no-wait ports.
I fully expect the future release of the game would go something like
this...
(all fees put on an account to be billed monthly)
$13.95/month to play
$5.00/level you advance in game after level 10
$5.00/to form a guild
$5.00/to join a guild
$5.00/to get married IN-GAME
$0.10/port
$0.10/rez 0-50 percent
$1.00/rez 50-90 percent
$5.00/rez 90-100 percent
$1.00/admission fee for any planes
$20.00/fee for completing an epic
$0.10/login fee
$5.00/petition fee unresolved
$20.00/petition fee resolved in the same day
$10.00/petition fee resolved past day of petition
$0.01/fine for KSing
$0.01/fine for Loot Stealing
$0.01/fee per char typed in chat
$0.10/fee for creating a chat channel
...these are to name a small few...(notice the fines are less than the cost
to get them addressed)

I just read that the EQIM service will be a monthly fee (as yet determined)

I just don't know anymore....

I have to get a second job just to afford to play the game...heck can some
wealthy person adopt me?

Dave
