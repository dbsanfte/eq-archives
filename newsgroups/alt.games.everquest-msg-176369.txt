You really ought to stop repeating this misinformation.  It does not
square with my 3.5 years of experience, nor with what's reported by
any of the tank-class players who've managed to earn my respect.
Taunt is less likely to take you to the top of the list if you're
well down, but the only reason repeated Taunts get you there is that
eventually the RNG smiles upon your petitiion.  Taunt success is NOT
incremental, it is pass/fail.  Were it incremental it would always
work when I'm near the top of the list (it doesn't), and it would
never work when I'm way down the list (sometimes it does).  And the
latter case pretty much rules out any "well it's incremental when it
works" squirming.
