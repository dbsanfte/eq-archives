I moved to Win2k on my main machine, and the sound from it's SB live
sucked. I removed that and took the Aureal Vortex from my secondary
machine, and loaded user supported drivers for 2k, and it sounds
awesome.

Sometimes when a company gets forced out, they do something right.
When Aureal went out, (unable to get their product out against SB's
Live hype although it seemed to be a superior product) they released
the code and specs for the soundcards, allowing those who have the
cards to continue making their own drivers. As a result, the user made
drivers for 2k take every advantage of the A3D chipset and Win2k's
Direct X. Open Source rules. Micro$oft take heed....
