We certainly wouldnt be even remotely close to Elementals without you
guys.  A few weeks helping twink you guys up while we learn the 4
zones seems a small price to pay.

> Ahh, the patented Prism Push(tm). :)  

Trust me, its not just you guys.  VC has worked hard to counteract
push, but every new recruit or guest begins the training and learning
again =)  BOT minis are an excellent training tool for this.  I wasnt
necessarily talking about push so much as pets getting AOE and going
nuts and not being able to settle down.  Pet hold is a wonderful thing
=)

Seems like all DD spells do to some extent, and add in stun weapons,
pally stuns, pet push and simple juggling 40 people in a space
designed for 5 people to walk through, and its a recipe for
frustration.  We are doing a lot better than I would have expected
tho, Water hasnt been nearly as bad as I imagined so far.

Hurt us a few times on RZ attempts, hope we got it settled now.

It's totally cool.  Its just coincidence that I happened to catch
this.  Shoot me an email if you have further concerns that arent
appropriate for Usenet.  =)  Or send em via your officers, they have
been amazing to work with, very patient and detailed.

It's been statistically proven.  I must die for the good loots!

Have concussion and subtletly 3, it doesnt matter.  =)  I have the
'big stack' of DKP and wont spend a single one till VC eventually gets
a shot at silk legs.  =)
