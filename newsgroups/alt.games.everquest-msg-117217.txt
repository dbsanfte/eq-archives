**NEWBIE ALERT**

I've been killing tons of things in N.Ro that have nodrop loop ex: Lion
tail, every part of a spider, etc.  I checked on allakahzam for quest, and
none of these items are listed - so I left them be... too much crap to haul
around.

Up in everfrost, every nodrop item I encountered was easily found in
allakazam, so I'm confused...

Is there a better resource for quest item indexing than allakazam?

thanks
