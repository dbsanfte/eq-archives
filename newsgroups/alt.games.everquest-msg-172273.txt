I was getting tired of Sony/Verant with respect to their patches and
things and thought I needed a change and bought Asheron's Call 2.

I have played AC2 a bit and I think that I may cancel my subscription
as I find EverQuest more playable.

The plus side of EQ is the playability of the game with AC2 I found I
was fighting the user interface and the game than actually fighting
within the game.

A lot of the concepts of AC2 are excellent; but I feel that something
is lost in all the glitz and glitter of an excellent looking UI and
game - but the game seems to be lacking.

I thought that I would be able to wander about a lot more but it seems
that the number of routes within an area is actually more restrictive
than what I would imagine.

I have returned back to EQ and find the depth of the game more
appealing and I may just let AC2 lie for the time being.  When
Sony/Verant finally mess up EQ (the game is more and more geared to
characters over level 50) and forget about the lower level characters
then perhaps I will stop EQ and will look for another game.  It may be
AC2 it may not be.  But it won't be another Sony/Verant game.

Just my thoughts.
