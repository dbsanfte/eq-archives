Hi dipshit, I guess you didn't notice that I DID port one group out.

I also failed to mention that I wasted 3 hours picking up people BEFORE the
raid, then, when the leader said "CLICK OFF ALL BUFFS AND WAIT FOR JUNK
BUFFS" some dipshit cleric started casting resist cold on everybody, before
junk buffs, I told them to stop and they asked me  "why?"

Enchanters can't exactly mez ice giants anyways.

Oh, and you might also want to learn to spell things correctly.
