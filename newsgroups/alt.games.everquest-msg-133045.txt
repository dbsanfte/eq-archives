I have a strong predjudice against the anon/role characters.

I don't rez em, I don't buff em, I don't group em, my druid won't port em.

Here's my reasoning; if you are anon, you are doing so so people won't
bother you asking for your services.  So why the Brell do you expect
me to provide mine?  Whatever you have to put up with, so do I, as a
non-anon cleric or druid.  OK, so my bard can happily go non-anon
for the next year and probably only get asked to locate three corpses...
but then no anon people are bugging him for buffs anyway.

I'm not sure why I won't group with them, but you provide at least some
rational for it here; again, what are they hiding?  Are they significantly
lower or higher than I am led to believe?  People are blue for quite
a range of levels, and red for an even larger one till quite late in the
game.  Of course at my current level, yellow can only mean one thing...
