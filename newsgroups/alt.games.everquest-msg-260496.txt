Actually, I see nowhere in the original post that the person asks for an 
in game map of PoE.  The OP may be well aware that mapping is disabled in 
the zone, in fact, it would be hard not to be aware of this if he went 
into PoE, and brought up the mapping feature.  There are maps available 
that you can print, or pull up on your screen, and look at.  You can't 
view them in game using the mapping feature however.

I will agree with your assesment of Kalshazaar however.
