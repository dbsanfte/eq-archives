This is the technique I've always used.  It works well with Velious 
giants, which conveniently still have a lot of HP left at 15% or so when 
they run.  The assorted mammals in western wastes are similarly good once 
you get that high.

I might have to investigate that factory guy in Inno though.  Is it Giwin, 
the gnome right by the door?  Or Researcher whatnot, in and to the left?
