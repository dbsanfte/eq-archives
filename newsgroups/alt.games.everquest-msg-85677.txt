Personally I really dislike the NoDrop and Lore tags anyway. Yes I know
they are necessary evils to stop twinking, farming and ebaying but sometimes I
think the cure is worse than the disease. Does anyone really care about twinking
anymore? Is farming really a problem any more due to all the new places to hunt
and items to get? Ebay is always a problem but I figure if people want to cheat
themselves out of the play experience and fun of the game my attitude is "whatever."

Speaking of quests. WTF is the deal with the twilight armor quests?
Verant says they don't like spoiler sites but who in the hell could figure
out those quests without a spoiler site? Or several years of their life
killing millions of mobs in 4 zones to get all those special mobs to spawn?
