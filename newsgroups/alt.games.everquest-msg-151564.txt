Hate to break it to you, but neither do the "unholy trinity" anymore.

Theres not one thing in an experience group that a paladin can't do as well
as me or better.  And they can provide backup healing while doing it.   With
PoP, they'll even be getting triple attack, so there goes my slight damage
bonus.  (assuming some form of haste in the group, if there isn't, the
paladin can self buff attack speed while I can't, so he has better damage
already.)

Same thing with SK's really.  Thier spell list isn't as nice (purely imo)
but they can do the warrior's job in a "non-raid" group every bit as well.
