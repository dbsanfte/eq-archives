I have graduated to Shadeweavers now equiped with all the kit I could leach
out of the pit. Killing Tailfang was very satisfying as he killed me a few
times when I was a kitten. I failed my first combine on the femurs, arghh!
but lucked out on the second attempt. Succeded with a skill of 26 in
pottery.

What a great class and what a great zone for quests. I thought playing a
bard would be similar to the chanter as they share some of the same class
abilities, which is why I never started one before. So far they are chalk
and cheese.
