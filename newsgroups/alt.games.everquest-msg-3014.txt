Part John Constantine and part Cerebus? Damn, you should start
grouping with me :)

>I've been saying 'Aye' long before I got hooked on EQ.

I said 'eh' a long time before I heard it was a Canadian thing...

>Cerebus is so far beyond brilliant it's scary. Read the collected 'Church
>and State' volume. Then read it again, and again, and again...

 I have 'High Society' here now, and I've managed to get a hold of
'Cerebus', 'Jaka's Story', and 'Reads' at various points. I've also
read bits and pieces of some of the other volumes from time to time.
