Made me laugh... I remember when my 60 warrior was helping with the
old Ragefire to keep Fire Giants clear once... I decided to train out
of SolB since it was pretty full.. The Kolbold Noble was up... and
suceeded charming me.

The funniest 2 minutes of my EQ life ensued as I slaughtered the group
I was providing cover for to get to zone, and then proceeded to
slaughter everyone at zone...

It's amazing the kind of havoc a 60 War can cause when he is computer
controlled.
