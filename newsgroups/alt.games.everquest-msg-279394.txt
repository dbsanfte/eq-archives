ATI will fix my annoying coworkers? Righteous!

Truthfully, though, I'm just not that good at tracking down hardware or
system software problems. Right now all I know for sure is that playing
eq2 locks my box up within 90 minutes. I've done virus scans, upgraded
video drivers, memory checks, cpu fan tests, etc. Nothing so far has made
the problem go away. Upgrading the video driver changed the MTBF from 2
minutes to ~20 minutes, so I'm leaning towards it being video related, but
of course that doesn't eliminate the driver, the video card, or eq2 itself
from the playing field. I was hoping this weekend to swap video cards with
my brother (we have the same type of card) to see if that will make a
difference. I'd definitely like to go to tech support with something more
to go on than "my game crashed -- fix it!"

As you seem to be interested in helping with the problem, feel free to
offer suggestions on how I can eliminate suspects or finger the guilty.
