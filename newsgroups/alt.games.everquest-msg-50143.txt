I havn't seen much begging at all in Greater Fay, then again I've had
/auction turned off since started, seemed to be a lot of ooc stuff
going on.

Here latly I've been on a kick of giving away the patchwork armour
given out for crushbone belt quest, and suprisingly a high elf turned
it down. Of course others grabbed it up fast. :)
