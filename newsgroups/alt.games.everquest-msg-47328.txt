The nighvision of a barbarian still sucks so extremely much that I did
not even notice the change in just creatiing one. I am still totally
blind in an unlighted area at night and my gamma is high enough that
my wood elf druid with only infra can't even TELL the difference
between day or night so that is not the problem. 

A more valid comparison would be if they changed your iksar experience
from minus 20 percent to minus 19.9999999999 percent.

The non infra/ultra character I created seems as blind as they always
did to me which is why I only prefer to play infra races at least.
