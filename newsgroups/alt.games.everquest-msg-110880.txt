Once again we see the spectre of redefining inconvenient things.

Obviously, I (and the media) am using the term "Christian" here in the
"member of the group" way, not the "perfect practitioner" way. Of
course, there are no perfect Christians, but what these people are
from a purely religious perspective is irrelevant - they are acting in
a political capacity, and political Christian rhetoric tends towards
the hateful, where fringe religions are concerned.


Don't fear that I'm painting all Christians with the same brush - I am
not. I was, upon a time long ago, a born-again Christian myself, and I
had the honor of knowing many people who were Christians in the pure,
religious sense of the word.
