Thats nice. The vast preponderence of people posting about the issue
on the EQ2 technical forumns having only this problem with EQ2 while
using differeing video cards, motherboards, CPU's and versions of
windows would suggest otherwise, however.

It appears to be zone specific in some ways; as I said, Qeynos harbour
is notably awful, and I never had the problem in freeport.

Im glad your system doesnt have any trouble though ;)
