Guilds that really use DKP systems, and use them well, know what will
drop in each zone, and generally only raid a limited number of zones.
(If you're in Vex Thal, why would you care what is dropping in ST with
now Sleeper?)  If you have to question how they can keep the list,
your guild is not ready to use DKP.  As to up to date, a well designed
system will not need to be modified much between expansions.  If the
items dropping from a certain mob aren't worth what they cost, due to
everyone in the guild having one, or better items available for less
points off another mob, then the guild won't be raiding those mobs
much.  It's rather a self-correcting system, once you have it all set
up.
I do have a question about DKP systems with preset values though.  How
do guilds deal with previously unknown items?  I assume that there is
a pre-determined max price for an item, and at worst the new item is
priced that way, but it still seems a bit unclear.  Also, what do you
do if two people both want to get an item, and both have points to do
so?  (A friend's guild just finished clearing Vex Thal, there's an
item there that has a right-click, unlimited KEI.  The guild in
question awards loot based on officer decision, but even a DKP guild
would have the same problem there, since EVERY enchanter there would
give all their DKPs for that one, or incur a deficit if allowed.  Who
makes the call in a DKP guild?)
