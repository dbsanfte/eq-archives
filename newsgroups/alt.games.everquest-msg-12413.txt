They changed it quite a while ago.  Now, if you go to the hidden oasis
in TD, there is an NPC standing near the water.  If you hail him, he
mentions something terrible lurking in the water (or something like
that).  The Druid can hand him something and he despawns and Faydedar
spawns in the water.

Well, he's suppose to spawn in the water.  The one Fay raid I went on,
he either spawned near the wall, or ran there very fast...so instead of
going for the tanks he was supposed to go for, he instead wiped out all
the casters first.  Oops.

The triggered Fay spawn only drops whatever it is Druids need from him
for their epic.  He has none of regular Fay's loot.

If the Druid and party fail to kill him, he despawns after a few hours.
The Druid gets back the thing handed in to spawn Fay, so they can try
again.

The regular Fay still drops the Druid epic stuff, too, so some Druids
might go that route, but I'd expect most use triggered Fay, because you
can plan that.  With regular Fay, you've got to luckily find him, and
then kite him around while frantically sending tells to friends and
guildmates asking them to rush to TD (a zone that no one can rush
to...note that you can't get there without a tedious boat trip).
