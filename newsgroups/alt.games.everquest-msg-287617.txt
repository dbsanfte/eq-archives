Well, since I'm an SK, I have to admit, not much.

I mean, he's better than a druid pet, but less than a shaman pet, much 
less the "real" pet classes.

There were levels where he wasn't even as good as a cleric pet... oddly, 
I think he was pretty much always better than a wizard pet even though 
they are really the same, because a wizard doesn't get his till a couple 
levels later, and by then its not as obviously a problem.

I -can- wrap him in cotton wool, which is to say, I bought the Suspend 
Minion AA's, and for that matter the Hold AA, which really is more 
servicable most of the time.   Trouble is, Hold doesn't help against AE, 
and there's nothing really that does, so the little guy tends to drop in 
raids no matter what I do.

Luckily, a bone chip, a little mana, and he's back, and the only trouble 
with that is, getting him all buffed up and geared up again is a pain, 
which is where suspend comes in, if I know whats coming up I can just 
shove him in a hole where he's safe unless I die... an all too frequent 
fate for the little guy though.
