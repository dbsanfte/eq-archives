I believe that, in the case of this thread, he was not flamed until he
started lashing out and making personal attacks against Lokari. Before
that, there seem to have only been dissenting opinions. It was not until
HE started flaming that others came in and nuked the hell out of him.
That, too, seems to be the norm in here. While some in here may have
chided him for his seemingly juvenile and naive logic, the personal
attacks on his character, or lack thereof, did not begin until after he
started attacking others. Had he kept his arguments logical and
level-headed, this discussion still could still have degenerated into
what it is now, but he would not have left it with the "Scarlet Letter"
that he now has emblazoned upon his chest.
