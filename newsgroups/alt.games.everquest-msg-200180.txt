Haha you are joking right?
Granite is at least on a par with earths (and imo more common) - combine 3,
yields 4 powdered granite (non-failure combine)

Going off memory here, but doesn't the smithing combines (the tempers) use
granite anyway (1 powdered granite)

I hack a stack or so of powdered granite on my rogue... its just the liquid
earths that evade me

Last time we did mudwalker ring (well, first time too!) we got about 7
earths during the course of the raid.  I scored 2, and managed to waste them
both on more failures /yay

Heh.. pulling the temple or not, I avoid dillos.  I pull one at the start
(DC) then avoid them like the plague!

Didn't notice the extra exp on the seekers though really.

Yesterday my group was monk/shaman/cleric (with ungrouped Enc) at the mephit
ledge.
The day before it was monk/shaman/cleric/warrior/enc/ranger, parked in the
building by vine land, pulling mostly the walker temple - anyway exp seemed
a fair bit faster yesterday - even with the way slower kill rate

Hmm guildies dropped the tree at the zone, and got the druid earing before..
/cheer rot

Btw, zero liquified earths last night, in 5 or so hours exping!
