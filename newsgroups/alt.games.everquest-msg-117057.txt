Don't forget that (unless this has been changed very recently) every
time DS does damage there is a chance for Offense/Weapon skill to go
up, just as if the PLee had scored a weapon hit.  This makes a weak DS
very effective at first, as it will get the PLee's offensive capability
up fairly quickly to the point where a strong DS doesn't just result in
a lot of zero xp poofed corpses, and it makes the DS approach much more
effective overall than the "Who me? I didn't do nuthin to ya, honest!"
alternatives for PLing a melee.
