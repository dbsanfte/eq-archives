I guess my ideas on this subject are colored by having
spent a few years at the Velvet Sweatshop. Microsoft hires many
foreign employees, particularly East Indian. Maybe I just like
to give the benefit of the doubt, but my first thought on this post
was that it was a non-english speaker rather than a d00d. I wonder
if the folks who immediately jumped on this guy might be getting
a bit too sensitive? I was rather surprised that several "regulars"
I've come to semi-respect were right in there razzing the guy.

*shrug* I'd like to respectfully suggest that everyone check
their sensitivity meters before answering questions with knee-jerk
responses. This person might very well have been simply a poor
typist or even a child. Flaming them with no other proof of their
intellect or intentions was jumping the gun a bit. (Okay, the
microsoft.com address was a pretty good tipoff that it wasn't a
child. That's no guarantee that it's a "smart" developer, though.
There are tons more "support level" people at microsoft than
there are developers: cooks, secretaries, project managers, interns...)

I was also a bit surprised to see "John Smith" labeled as a troll
almost immediately. After playing Jedi Knight online and seeing the
rampant hacking in that game as well as hearing about similar things
in Diablo, it seems like a perfectly normal question for someone to
ask. Granted, you and I understand the differences between EQ and
those other games but that doesn't mean that everyone does. Assuming
that the person "ought to know stuff already" based on their email
address (which is the only reason I can see for the attacks that
came off here) is a grave error.

In short, I don't support "John Smith"'s later attitude (the axe to the
head thing was way over the line) but I think that people jumped the
gun on berating him without any actual evidence that he deserved it.

My $.02. Do what you want with it. Just know that I hold you in
the utmost respect while you do it.
