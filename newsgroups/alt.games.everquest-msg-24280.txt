The flip side is that there won't be any high-level players hanging around
helping the lowbies, either.

Whenever my 50+ Paladin goes "slumming" for some quest item that
drops from a very green creature, or to acquire an item that I didn't
know I'd need until 30 levels past the "appropriate" level to hunt
for it, I always do tons of stuff to help the lowbies who are
in the zone hunting exp.  I've saved a lot of lives, and helped
a lot of people with what would otherwise have been a messy
corpse recovery.

If Warrens-style loot rules locked the door on me, they'd have
to fend for themselves.

The "no high level people hanging around" issue works both ways...
