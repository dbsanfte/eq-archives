    When I read "broken or not fully implemented", I interpret that as
"unable to be completed as is". To that, I give two examples from the world
of tradeskills. The first is Lawena, an NPC in Shadow Haven that asks for
her favourite drink. Note that her name is an anagram of "new ale". EQ
Traders thread: http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=5745

    To summarize: every possible beverage had been handed to this wench
without any response. Brodder Foamymugs, a player that submitted a number of
brewing recipes to SOE a while back (and had many published in game),
started giving hints about what her favourite drink could be. One of the
players reading the thread, using the hints, created a heretofore-unknown
beverage that is documented nowhere in game. Only Brodder, who knew what
recipes he'd sent to SOE, knew the recipe - and it was in game. Can Lawena's
quest be completed? I'd guess that it can, but only if you knew things that
no person could possibly have guessed in a million years.

    The second is froglok cultural tradeskill items. In one of the many EQ
Traders threads lamenting the lack of Froglok cultural, Absor (SOE employee
and PR guy) responded that they have cultural, he'd asked the tradeskill
guy. The players asked for a clarification - did he mean that they can wear
cultural products made by other races (which was known), or that they could
create their own unique items? He responded that they had their own unique
items they could craft. To date, nobody has found any documentation in game
for these items. Do they exist? I bet they do, but that the documentation
for them was never implemented.

    So when I see Ry'Gorr scalps, I imagine there's a poorly-scripted quest
out there that uses them. Guard Bobob may have unbracketed text where he
talks about what a thread the orcs are to Frostone (sp?). If you tell him "I
will defend Froststnoe from the rgyorr", he gives you an eight slot box
which you must fill with scalps, combine, and return to him. So hailing all
the dwarves in town would give no quest leads, handing scalps to dwarves at
random would do nothing, and you'd never guess the spelling mistakes in the
quest trigger phrase, but the quest does exist! =/

    I wonder if the devs realize how much respect they would earn from
players if one patch was nothing but corrections to all "undiscovered" old
quests such that they could be discovered and completed. And debugging
existing content would be a lot more time-effective than creating all new
content for the same level ranges, don't you think?
