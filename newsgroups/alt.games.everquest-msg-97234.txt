You make me very happy that my necro has had a copy of this spell since
level 18. Ah, the benefits of higher level friends (and alts)!

I too am going through the joys of collecting stuff explictly for tailoring
and doing the shawls. I will spend a few nights in the Warrens to get
Paineel faction before I go to Stonebrunt.

The Hole key is sold in the shop in front of the bank. It looks like a small
bag, and sells for just over 100pp, depending on CHA.
