That depends what your definition of a lower-end guild is.  Just becase they
aren't years old, at the cutting edge of each expansion first, doesn't mean
they are noob part time raiders.  On VS we had 3 guilds raid 6 days a week.
The 4th and 5th guilds raid 3-4 days a week, and 6-8 raids 3 days a week.

Even 3 days a week is enough attendence in most guilds that use attendence
as a pre-req for loot. And 4 days is probably more than the average member
of your guild currently makes.  We have a lot of slackers (a lot), and very
few 100%ers so the results could be a little distorted, but our average
attendence across the guild runs at about 62%.

We are a much smaller population server, and I expect we will feel the
strain long before a lot of US servers do, and its not critical mass for us
just yet

With loot inferior to drops from  MPG/rift trash, 1 group named, 1 group
trials :)

Does time foci cap at 65 or 67?  Needless to say most of the important foci
are on qvic armour.
Haste?  you mean haste for some clerics or something? :)
Clickies: Bert Veil, TT's Veil, Songblade, Quarm ring.  Eye of dreams clicky
is found on mobs as gimp as Hulcror, let alone the GoD instanced stuff thats
doable with way fewer people now.
Slow sticks, maybe.  Its great utility.. but its also half the stats of epic
1.5

Yes.  At a far lower quality.  NtoV is faster loots/hour than PoTime too..
:)

We did an evening of qvic/tx. Had an early night so Inktu'ta could easily
have been fitted in too for another 8 high quality loots + 10 or so augs.
Had we done Ink'tu also, we'd have beaten potime in loot drops / loot
quality by so damn much.

Muramite Boots 15.00
Muramite Helm 10.00

23 drops, not including the shit that rotted..  With ink it would be like 40
w/augs.  PoTime is 44 drops? With about half being ok, and about 10 being
"good".  Versus the above drops which were virtually all over 200 hp items
(without looking at every items stats id say 99% was 200 hp or mana+).

Assuming you recruited from a guild who at least reached potime, you can
discount most phase 1-3 items, which cuts the loot down 50% (even tho most
of it sucks).  Yep GoD is less loot, but its all at a seriously higher
level.

No its not.  Maybe for you, or Quellious it is.  But that doesn't mean the
same applies on other servers.  Plenty still have active PoTime rotations
which the top guys havent been a part of for about a year.

9 drops went to longstanding members, 14 went to "new" guys.
So "all but the worst drops" doesn't apply in our case for sure.  Qvic is
virtually 100% app gear. 9 of the 14 items werent from qvic either. So it
all surpassed even Quarm items that your new peeps "sometimes may have a
chance on"

Well yes my hp is very high, Im also a monk.  My AC is worthless to the
point that the last 800 or so points of it havent given me a character
boost. Any plate class can have 500 less AC than me (which when comparing
leather versus plate is a HUGE contrast) and their effective AC is still way
over mine.  Thats before we even consider better damage mitigation by real
tanks.  The last extensive damage parses showed a monk took more overall
damage than a fucking druid (monk had some shielding and much better AC
too).

Im not saying take a monk tank, but a *warrior* doesn't need my HP to tank
there.  An SK/Pali doesn't need my HP to tank there.  I probably tank as
well as a warrior with 1.5 to 2k less HP than I.  For sure a warrior with 8k
has tanked there that I've seen, and thats over 2k below me.

A higher geared/mana cleric can help offset the disadvantage of a lower
geared/HP tank.

We did the 65 augs as a trio: me, cleric, wiz. Shaman 2boxed by me (of
course hehe) to make 4 in the group. The Wiz is often an SK instead, or
sometimes a ranger (snare of course).  Included in that was the HP/Mana augs
and the plate BP dude.

70 augs... well with the charm Id make sure the snarer was a melee class not
a wiz.. So 2 melees as a pre-req, other than that identical to the other
camp.

Also remember hes from a high level guild.  Assumably the other 20 people
who were logging on have similiar aspirations and its not difficult to find
a group that wouldn't struggle in there.

A group from an Elemental guild routinely farms the zone - and GoD/Omens
drops have been on a par with and bettered EP drops for some time now, so
even non-EP the number differences aren't that huge.
