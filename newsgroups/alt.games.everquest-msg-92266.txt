Supply and demand will take care of this issue just fine. $40 may be
too much for you, but I'm sure it's not too much for alot of people
playing EQ. I personally pay more than that for cable TV service in my
home, and I'm sure I spend as much time playing EQ as watching TV.

If the service is too expensive, then verant will discontinue it
because of lack of interest. If people do pay for the service, then
who are you to say it's too expensive? Maybe you should get a job, or
just forget about the legends server.

I want a BMW too, but the BMW company is so greedy! I think they
should just charge $25 for the 700 series at the highest.
