Bittorrent is a peer-to-peer download system, so while you are downloading,
you are also making those parts you downloaded available to others.  So,
imagine 1000 people are trying to download a big file.  The "normal" way,
you have 1000 people hitting the download server, and probably running into
bandwidth limits on the server.  So, if you are #500, you get a sucky
download.

With Bittorrent, the file is divided into small chunks, and as each person
downloads, they make the chunks they've received available.  So, if you are
#500, your client can start downloading from 10 or 20 other people who got
in ahead of you, pulling different chunks from each of them, and as you get
chunks, those become available to other people.  If it works right,
Bittorrent gets faster the more people there are trying to download.

However, it is important to have a good Bittorrent client.  Blizzard used
their own client for the WoW beta, and it sucked.  Consider a typical
consumer bandwidth connection that has a download speed of up to 1.5-3
mbit/second, and an upload speed of 256 kbit/second.  The Blizzard client
would quickly saturate your 256 kbit/second upload.  Since the upload was
saturated, the TCP connections on your download slowed to a crawl (because
the ACKs getting back were slow).  A good Bittorrent client lets you limit
the upload speed.  By limiting it to 128 kbit/second, you can still share
with others so the system works, without killing your own download.  When I
poked around on the net and found a posting that had the torrent file for
the WoW download, so I could use a non-Blizzard client to get it, my
download jumped from around 3 kbytes/second to 112 kbytes/second.

Anyone know if they are using a good Bittorrent client for AO, or are they
using some crappy client of their own, like Blizzard did for the WoW beta?
