I have seen this in WC also. I haad my Druid on at the time, so I did a
little testing. I first got as close as I could with my tracking, aand
casted a eaarthquake type spell. The Hill gaint started to beaat on me,
which in turn gave me a target. I then started to do my druid kiting thing.
I killed the gaint. All the time I did not see any gaint at all around me,
but I could hear him and be hit by him. He also gave me exp. =)
