Well, if you look at my sig, you can see it's 30 actually.  I believe that
the reason for quoting a ridiculous price is basically saying that he didn't
feel like porting you at that point in time, for whatever reason.  But, if y
ou were willing to really make it worth his while, he'd go through the
trouble.  The reason it costs so much, is because he didn't feel like it,
and frankly 10 or 15 or 20 pp is probably quite meaningless to him, for that
matter, 70 probably doesn't mean all that much either.  I don't have any
idea how much played time I have on any of my characters, I don't check, I
don't care, I play to have fun, I expect that's why everyone else is there,
so if someone doesn't think that him porting me somewhere would contribute
to his having fun, who am I to disagree with him.  Sounds to me that given
your situation, that you need to consider working on your faction in
Freeport.  You made the choice at some point, either when you created the
character, or later that Freeport faction was not important to you, now you
just have to live with the consequences, or fix the problem.  Frankly I
don't give a rat's ass how much longer than me you may or may not have
played.  Have fun, I do.
