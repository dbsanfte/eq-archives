Or how about something that actually makes sense?

Like the undead froggies boiling up out into UPPER Guk?
Some poor level 13 troll zones into the Ghoul Lord and the
Frenzied Ghoul...

Bloodsabres sending their pets out  of the sewers?  Or
even into the hills...that kinda sucks being the newbie in
Qeynos that day, but still it makes sense.

Drolvarg war on Firona Vie's outpost.  Don't let 'em in to the city,
but a constant supply of battling drolvargs and outpost guards
all day would be neat.../assist Guard Whisperwind :-).

Drop the Dracoliche into the Courtyard in Cazic Thule...

Turn the ghouls that guard in Neriak 3rd gate KOS
to all, including their guildmasters (they won't last long,
but still...).

Pickclaw invasion of Misty Thicket.  Lord Pickclaw
could meet up with Mooto and kill some deputies...

March of the drowned citizens from Freeport....

Every spawn point for Spectres gets triple spawns...

Bring Mayong Mistmoore not only in his castle,
but take him on a tour of the L. Faydark, Steamfont,
and the G. Faydark...if he kills you, you're undead
for the day (nothing permanent).

Etc...
