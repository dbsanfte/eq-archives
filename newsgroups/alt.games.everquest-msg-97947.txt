I think it's to remove things like level 7 for an enchanter. The point where
your level 4 dot and pet aren't cutting it any more and the stuff is getting
to powerful to melee without heavy downtime.

Mind you if you know how the game works it's not so bad, but I suspect a lot
of first time gamers get killed an awful lot on these power transitions.
