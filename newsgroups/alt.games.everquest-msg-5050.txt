*shrug*  I killfiled her because it was pretty obvious that she has nothing to
contribute to anything around here I might be interested in discussing.   And
I found her somewhat less than amusing to listen to.

My opinion though is that she's really a caricature.  I mean, not even the
dewds are this dewdish.  So I really don't see all that much chance that she's
the real thing.
