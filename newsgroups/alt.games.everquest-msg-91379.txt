	Well hey, I was going to bring over a level 58 Ranger with both epics,
Tolan's or better armor in all slots, Lodi shield, etc.

	I would prefer to be involved in dynamic quests and such after levelling
is no longer a concern, myself.  That way you're not really taking time out of
development.  What bugs me about the Legends reports is not so much the levels
involved, but the fact that the players stuck to the same old behavior
patterns we see on the standard servers: race to kill everything you can on
server reset.

	I very much believe the Legends content staff will be casting pearls
before swine.
