 Have you ever tried to get that 1 item to complete a quest only to
have someone else come in and start killing the mobs without asking if
your camped there or not? Its infuriating. The fact I couldn't get
this stupid piece of the quest for 3 days, couldn't get a dam group i
a so-called 'hot spot' to help.

All I hear is 'Everquest Community'.. bullshit.

The subject was uncalled for, I was mad at the time.

 As for the zoning and gloating , oh well. They did something against
the 'Community Spirit' and they paid the price. Simple unspoken rule.
If somoene (or group) is in a spot you intended to hunt you ask to
either join, let you know when they are done, or ask if you can have
the spot. That what I've observed playing.
