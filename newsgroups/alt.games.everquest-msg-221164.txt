This brings me to a particular pet peeve of mine.. why is it that only
Clerics get compensated for Peridot costs? What about us Encs? Yeah, those
Runes I toss up for when there's a 4-5 pull; one of those takes a peridot.
And I'll sometimes cast it 9-10 times per adventure.

Not saying they don't deserve compensation, just I think people don't seem
to realize that Encs do also use peridots =P
