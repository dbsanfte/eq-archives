Ummm, would that be the ranger only sword from VP?
The one that's got worse damage/delay than a fine steel longsword?

4/28 is just too crappy to tolerate for an unreliable 620dd proc
(especially since that proc can be resisted).

VI REALLY needs to go back and check on those drops.  Given the stupid
mudiflation with Velious and Luclin, some of those weapons are
absolute crap.
