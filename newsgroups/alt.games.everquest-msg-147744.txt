I'm still wearing one of the bracers.

But even when introduced most of the cleric gold was junk, look
at the stats.  If it doesn't have Wis, mana, or HP on it, don't even
think about wearing it.  Lets out most of the gold.   Bad news,
lets out most of the purple, too, when you get planar and can
easily loot a full set from Hate.  Donals?  OK, so thats a reason
to violate the "wis, mana, HP" rule, but thats because it has
clicky effects.  Sadly, most of the effects are useless, so a full
set of that is a joke too.

It would be great if some "matching set" armor was introduced
that actually was worth wearing as such, but till then, you can
have fashion, or you can have good stats, not both at once.
