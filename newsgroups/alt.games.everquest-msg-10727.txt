Higher level and named mobs can count more.
I went on a raid in Kael Drakkel and killed about 50
named giants maximum. I went from Amiable to Ally
with the Coldain dwarves from just those 50 giants.
I am guessing that those 50 giants were worth 500-950
'points' on that faction scale, depending on where I was in
in the amiable range.

Also, quests have different levels of faction adjustment as well.
