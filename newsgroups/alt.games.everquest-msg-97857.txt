I am definitely an EQ veteran, one of these so called "longtime
dedicated 'Evercrack' addicts" and I  think these new changes are
awesome! Most of these changes have been on my personal wish
list for a long time.

I have been playing this game for 3 years, since about a month after
it came out. While I do not consider myself an extreme hard core
person that plays 24/7 like some people seem to, I am definitely not
a 'casual' 1 hour a day player either.

I see nothing but good from these changes. I was getting a little
burned out like I sometimes get but with Luclin and these new
changes it has renewed my interest and I am thinking about
getting a 2nd account and starting up some more new characters.
