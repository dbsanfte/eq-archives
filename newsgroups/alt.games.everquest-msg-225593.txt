Great story. Thanks. Takes me back to my first dragon pick-up raids back 
in the day. My first FOUR attempts were met with somewhat, ummm.. "less 
success" than yours, though. Congrats on getting it on the first try.

Far more memorable for me was my first pick-up Vox raid, though. (Unless 
things have changes, Vox is a considerably harder dragon than Naggy for 
new raiders to handle.)

In case you've never done it, there's a trick door you have to go 
through to get into Vox's lair. And if you miss it, nearby, there's a 
pit trap that drops you down into a simply awful cave full of bears and 
giant spiders of quite high level. ("Quite high" for people likely to be 
on an old school Vox raid anyway.)

On our first outing, I (along with approximately 1/3 of the raid force) 
bravely shouted our battle cries and went charging ahead....

... straight into the pit trap. I was dead and never even saw the dragon 
that time. I got my unrezzable corpse summoned out of there later.

/sigh
