Seriously, does one REALLY get a horse for the travel speed?  While
the top horses are indeed worth it for the speed (as there isnt an
alternative thing like J/Tboots), the reality is that you buy a horse
because it is "cool".

I can imagine.  This was not something I was aware of regarding
horses.  Certainly a good point.

3k?  Any idiot can make 3k and the result is horses everywhere.
Heck, an enchantress friend of mine went to Halas a few weeks back and
spent a good portion of the weekend banking at the IG's and Casting
Breeze.  Killing Momma's in her spare time and came back with 2k.
Also at costs that low many people would justify buying one.  At 8k
minimum many people REALLY have to think about how badly they want
one.

>Right now I regard them as a stupid person tax.

Stupid?  Not to me.  Much like EC, things are only worth what a person
is willing to pay.  Those who arent willing to spend big cash on a
horse wont, while others would rather lack a pot to piss in but have a
horse.  Kind of like the guy who has an $8,000 Entertainment System in
his 1 room apt. and sits on Milk Crates to watch it.  "Yeah, so I dont
have furniture..... Check out this STEREO!!!"  or in the case of said
Enchantress above, "OK, so I have Raw Silk in half my slots at level
37....... I am GONNA have a HORSE first!!!!!  Horse first then
equipment!" =)
