My cleric is all of level 11, I don't play him.  I often am in groups 
without a cleric, and really, it is not a problem.  I have often been in 
groups where I am the main healer, and in addition to that, I slow, 
haste, use my pet, and DoT the mobs.

It's not a question of demand, just saying that a cleric is not necessary 
for almost any single group content.
