I would hardly call two years to level 14 twinking, especially since I
earned everything I just added.  At least, I earned it within the scope of
the game.  I didn't get all the items as drops, but I did farm the spider
silks I paid for them with.  Well, not all those, either.  But this guy was
underselling me, and I had some extra cash, so I bought his inventory.  He
made money.  I made money.  We're all happy.  ;-)
