It is not so much the wayfarer zones, it's the newbie zones, that aren't
city zones. Greater Faydark is not affected, but Steamfront is. South Qeynos
has no skellies pop, but Qeynos Hills has. South Ro, North Ro, they aren't
affected. Couldn't say anything about Nektulos Forrest because I haven't
been there but Toxxulia Forrest is also overrun by skellies at night.
