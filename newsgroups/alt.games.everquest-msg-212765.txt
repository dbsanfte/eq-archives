Hey, I was looking at my clerics gear tonight and I seem to be sorely
lacking..... here's a link to my profile,
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/userinfo.html?char=346894
Basicly I'm looking for suggetions on upgrades, I'm by no means in an
uber-guild, at best we can field 2-3 full groups of 50-62 players with most
in the middle range, but I would definatly like to upgrade my gear to
something that will last until I can start hunting mobs that drop ornate
molds :-P .  Also, I seem to stay continually poor, aside from the
occasional good night in PoK whoring out temperance for plat, so if you
suggest buying a player made item, please feel free to toss in a tip or two
on how to make some plat.  I do have a couple of things i would like as far
as focus effects go, they include, Improved Healing III, Extended
Enhancement III, Extended Range III, Mana Preservation III, and if possible
an Improved Damage III.


Thanks in advance for your help,

Adunis Lifebringer, Vicar of the 53rd prayer
