    Casts in one second, has an exceptional damage/mana ratio compared with
Upheaval. Awesome spell for AoE group work. I have it and love it. My group
ALWAYS gets the XP when we do AoE when clearing to somewhere easy, like
Royals in Chardok - I've dumped 1300 damage on every mob that was pulled in
seconds. Even the wizards have a hard time keeping up with that quick a
burst of damage.

    If you could, the spell would be almost as good as the Jyll's line of
wizard PBAoE nukes.
