| For your first character with no established higher level friends yet, no
higher

broke

if

|
| Tip #1. If you are in the habit of typing things like "B4" instead of
"before",
| get out of it now.  You'll only annoy a lot of the people who *might* have
been
| otherwise inclinded to help you get ahead.  #2. Never beg. People hate
beggers.
| #3. Always be polite, particularly if you are asking for something like
SoW (a
| spell to make you run faster) or a heal or a port (magical transport to
another
| location) etc. Always offer to make a donatation if you can. #4. Learn to
group
| early in your career. Use the /shout command to say "/shout Level 5
Warrior (or
| whatever) looking for group!" You'll meet lots more people, make friends,
and
| advance faster. #5. Read this newsgroup a lot, avoiding the pointless
flame
| threads. You'll get lots of good tips.  #6 Go bookmark
| http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ and http://eq.castersrealm.com/ as well
as the
| Sony homepage.  These resources will provide tons of valuable information.

|
| From what I've seen of three servers, and what I read of others, they are
all
| the same except the PvP (player killer) servers. Just pick one that's
green on
| the server selection screen. They have the lowest populations and will
hopefully
| have a little less lag, etc.
|
| >  What type of character should I be for my 1st character? etc. etc. etc.
|
| You can be whatever you enjoy most. You likely won't keep your first
character
| anyway. A basic melee type is nice to start out with at first to learn the
| interface. A warrior, monk, rogue, or even a paladin to learn something
about
| how to use spells. Start a pure caster too (wizard, mage, necro, cleric)
to
| learn about that. Try to avoid the evil races at first, since faction can
be a
| headache. I would say a Dwarven or Barbarian warrior *might* be a nice
first
| character to take a look around with.  Up to you, though.  And if your set
came
| with the tutorial, run that first. It will help.
|    If you don't want to spend ten days on bugs and bats, realize that the
only
| effective way you are going to advance is by getting out there and killing
stuff
| and getting experience.  Sure, go turn in your note to your guild when you
first
| start, but then get out there, kill everything that cons even
(black/white) or
| lower to you, loot everything you find and sell it to vendors. Save up
your
| money. Save bone chips from decaying skellies to sell by the stack to
higher
| level characters. There's a good early money making tip for you. Most of
all,
| talk to people. Get in groups. Suck the knowledge of the world out of them
for
| tips, etc. and make friends that you can rely on. Keep on killing. If you
waste
| your time trying out low level quests and "looking around town", you may
enjoy
| yourself, but you won't be doing anything to get out of bug/bat hell.
