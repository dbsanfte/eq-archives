I was in South Karana the other day, when someone shouted "Looking for
port to NK"  Having just turned 29 with my Druid, I send him a tell "I
can port you meet me at the NK bridge"  He replied "I'm in the middle
of the zone"  At that point I realized where we where and where he
wanted to go.

Last night I was in Lavastorm picking up a guildmate to do a rez on
another guildmate.  There a mid-40's ranger was shouting "Looking for
port to WC"  For the amount of time he was looking for a port, he
could have easily sowed and camoed himself and ran to WC and back.

I'm just surprised at how unwilling some people are to run. 
Pre-luclin it wasn't umcommon for my mage, or enchanter  to run from
one side of the continent to the other.
