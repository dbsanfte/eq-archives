Finally. I hate trying to loot something and being told I am too far
away, when I am at it's damn feet!

Hehehe priceless? Until this patch, it sounds more like it was
worthless!

Yay! It always sucked to be penalized when your death was the game's
fault, not your own.

Umm...yeah. Good idea.

Anyone know what the exploit was?

This could get a little annoying sometimes. I hope this is not the case
when you loot your own corpse.

Finally. For those who play on multiple servers, this is truly a gift
from the gods.

Damn. I really liked the ability to sell everything in a backpack. It
can sometimes be annoying to have to click an item, then move over to
the sell button, then click and item, then move over to the sell button,
etc. I wish they'd just put in a key command that would let you sell
something you have selected, like Ctrl-S or something like that...

Again, a long time in coming.
