Your reasoning seems a bit questionable to me. Does the fact that some 
people speed give them the right to use their mobile phone in a movie 
theatre, to smoke in a hospital, or to park their car in a reserved 
space? Perhaps to you choosing a stupid EQ name is closer to the former, 
but for me it's closer to any of the latter.

If you don't take it to a point at which you are actually endangering 
other people's lives, speeding is something exclusively between you, the 
road and the cops. On the other hand, every EQ player in your server has 
to put up with your idiot name. And in both cases, you have no one else 
to blame when you get caught.
