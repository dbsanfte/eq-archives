Nope, that don't do it.  Accidentally made my bro-in-law's computer
autojoin s.age and Cel was ready to kill me for it so I went over to
his house and fiddled around.  Ended up having to edit the ini file,
as you said, and now I can't remember what I did - deleted the
channel, typed 'off', or typed 'default' - I *think* after pondering
over what would be the most logical idea, I just deleted the channel
names.  But don't quote me on that.
