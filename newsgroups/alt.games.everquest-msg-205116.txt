No, I meant well below 100.  The way it is supposed to work for a mage 
pet, is the pet will use it's own 100% immunity to fire based damage, if 
the mage's own FR is below 100.  If the mage has an FR over 100, the pet 
inherits the mages' FR instead, which make sit susceptible to fire 
damage.  The whole point of using the fire pet is the immunity to fire 
damage.
