What I have seen in LDoN and in the past (kael as example).

There is a ML for all vendor trash that gets split at the end.  There
is a roll for all No drop items, and if you have won you dont roll
again untill all have won one, or that no one wants said item except
you.  And a roll for all dropable items, but under a Need before Greed
stance.  If you Can and WILL use you can roll.  If you win you are out
of all rolls till all get an item.  If no one can use all roll for
selling in bazaar (unless you already won a dropable item).

They are two seperat rolls, because Augments are not usualy as good as
item drops.  Augments are like Quest armor drop in Kael, compiared to
dropable weapons / gear.  Two seperate instances.
