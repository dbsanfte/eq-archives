    Wait until the end of the year. By January you will know if it is really 
dying or just stalled. If you remember PoP, you remember what a stall can be 
like.

    Start going after people, don't wait for them to pick you. Look at other 
guilds just beneath yours, guilds which are also likely going through the 
same thing you are, and start sending tells. Trust me, if their guild is 
going through what yours is they'll jump at the chance to app to someone 
that can get them geared in Qvic armour in a hurry like you can.

    First off, Zun is easy. Once you play with it a bit and see that to kill 
Zun you must charm a mob that the four guys at the bottom can pop out, the 
rest falls into place pretty quickly. Secondly, there's other content you 
could be doing in addition to what you listed, like some of the easier MPG 
trials. In fact, I'd strongly recommend skipping Tacvi and heading right to 
the MPG trials. Tacvi is a lot of effort for little reward. Are you farming 
RCoD/NC/WoS for 69/70 spells, too?

    Smack Madrone and get him to read this. You can either be nostalgic and 
let shit fall apart while you pine for the people you've lost, or get it 
together, decide you have something worth saving, and take the steps needed 
to save it. It's up to you.

> So, should I put in a cross-server app myself to some other guild?

    Even without your work situation, I'd say no. Most people who x-server 
end up quitting in a few months anyways. All your friends are gone, so if 
you run into another bad time you have no reason to fight through it and 
keep playing.

    Tacvi and Anguish are crap zones. Things like the MPG trials and 
Inktu'ta ARE the good parts of EQ. The only good part of the endzones is the 
loot - but there's more to EQ than the loot.

> So, I sit here and think.  Quite a bit.  Retire?

    If you do, server transfer to Quellious and give me your stuff, please. 
;-) And don't say it's all No Drop - I know you have plat, and I can sac you 
down with my necromancer for essence emeralds! Those things sell for 350 pp 
each!!!

> Try to stick it out with my current guild?

    If you're going to keep playing EQ, this is the solution to pick. Make 
your guild better and stronger. It's something you already enjoy being a 
part of, filled with people you like. You won't recreate that elsewhere.

    My guild had an issue with people quitting recently. GoD, as you said, 
is draining, and the new games coming out didn't help. But we've worked 
through it, are in Anguish first on our server, and have a blast each and 
every day. Our recruitment process has found some high-quality people - not 
toons, people - to join us, and we're stronger for having done it. It's not 
all roses - my best RL friend, a friend of nearly 20 years, quit EQ because 
the death of LDoN meant he couldn't find groups during his infrequent play 
sessions. Sacrificing down the character he's worked hard on for five years 
to get to 66 wasn't easy, although in true dwarven fashion the 70 K worth of 
Essence Emeralds I got from it did make it a bit easier on me. But you move 
on, and keep playing for the fun that is there.
