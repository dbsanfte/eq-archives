the WIS is good, but there is no AC or resists.  dmg and delay is avg.  It's
over priced. eqprices is hard to judge as well.

I prefer to purchase items that have been in game for a good long time.  I
wouldn't consider paying 1.5kpp on this item for my 45 Dru.  I'd be aiming
for the Dark Ember at min.
Damage: 13
Delay: 32
Ratio: 2.461
Str: +2 Wis: +5 Fire Resist: +7 HP: +20 Mana: +20  for anywhere between 1.5k
and 2k on the Zeb server.

at 45+, it's not likely you're actually slashing and bonking the mobs.
you're either kiting or meding for DD or heals.

If anything, I'd try closer to 400 - 500pp to a mid 20char that can really
use it.

Hell, at 2.5kpp you can get Effritti boots.
