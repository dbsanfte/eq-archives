Well Ed, I'm not really sorry that you take my little gibes so
persoanally.  I play EQ and participate in this NG in order to
divert myself from the boredom and stress of everyday life.
I find the annoyance of your "Why doesn't SOE do things the way
I think they should?" posts to be more than outweighed by your
outraged responses to my not so gentle poking and prodding at
their illogic.  If you don't want to read this sort of response
to your posts you can (1) simply ignore my posts (I hear that
killfiles were invented for this sort of thing), or (2) give a
bit more thought to how somebody other than Ed Jensen might read
what you're about to post.  Just because you don't like something
doesn't mean it is "wrong".  Your "why...?" posts read as whiny
attempts to gain sympathy for your complaints.  I put up with
a certain amount of whining from my children, because it goes
with the territory.  You claim to be an adult, if expecting you
not to whine like a spoiled teenager is being an ass, then I guess
I'll just have to go on being an ass.
