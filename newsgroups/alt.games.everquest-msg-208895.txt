Replying to a bunch of different folks here...

I think I know what you are referring to...we fought from the top down,
not the bottom up though.  Oddly enough the one it is "linked" to will
come solo for me from the other direction, if that makes sense.  We only
did the two rooms, the two with the named, due to what our team could
handle.

Aye :) Got him to spawn twice in the 6 hour period.  No belt, though.  
The belt is indeed the rare drop, for the other person that asked.  The
other named in this area, in the room above the rotting shopkeeper room,
is the undead blacksmith who drops the kylong breastplate or battleworn
ch'ror (not sure which is his common, but it's easy enough to find out).  
Only saw him once. 

I've concluded that this is the sort of camp you do if you want the haste
belt for yourself, but farming the belt for cash would be painful, because
you'd be lucky to get it in a 12 hour period (or so I suspect, having done
6 hours with no belt).  Fellspine's belt would be better bang for the
buck, if you have the know-how to handle Siren's Grotto.
