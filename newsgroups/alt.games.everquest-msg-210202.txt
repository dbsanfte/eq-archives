I've used a Black Alloy Medallion on *all* my casters up until lvl 49. 
Has Mana Preservation 2 on it.  If you have any nice high level friends
they can easily solo for this.  I can get one in about 15 minutes
including travel time if the Lord is up when I get to Runnyeye.  When
you get up around 30 or so you can probably take a group in here and
kill him yourself. 

For Improved Healing 2 (my favorite thing on my druid), you might try
for a Book of Obulus, though they're a bit on the pricey side (2-4k on
my server) and there's no way you'll be looting one in the immediate
future. 

Shimmering Terror Hide Boots and Moonstone Ring are a couple of decent
Extended Range 2 items.  Should also be pretty cheap to buy. 

For Spell Haste 2 you're probably looking at a Fine Antique Corset,
which is quested out of Plane of Knowledge.  It basically requires
running around to all the expansions and foraging an item (some of them
can take a while to forage and are only found in high-level zones, but
you can stick to the zone walls and be pretty safe).  The good news is
that all the items are droppable, so it's possible to just buy 'em up or
find a friend to forage 'em for you.  Another option to look at might be
a Mithril Runed Tunic, though I have no idea what they sell for. 
Unfortunately with the Droga/Nurga revamp the Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid
Mask isn't much of an option any more.  Though you may be able to find a
nice bard or enchanter willing to escort you into the hand-in guy. 
Djarn's Amethyst Ring is also very nice for this one, but somewhat
pricey.
