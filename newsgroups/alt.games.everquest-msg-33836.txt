this is not true. you MUST have somehow gotten on the MOB's hatelist to get
the faction hit. even in Velious.

I've been in groups in Velious many times. Giant groups mainly. If I do not
actually get on the hate list of the MOB, I do NOT get the faction hit.

now, there are several ways of getting on the hate list...attacking, healing
someone in the group, being attacked by the MOB because you got too close,
etc...
