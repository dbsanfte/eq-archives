  There are a few counter examples to this.  Take the Vikings, for
instance.  "I'm gonna get rich" was *exactly* why they joined the army
(although "army" is defining that loosely), in addition to the other
less wholesome reasons, along with other things like personal pride
and societal status, etc.
  Mercenaries probably didn't think they would get rich, although they
were certainly getting *paid*.  Unfortunately the loot probably wasn't
as good as their employer claimed the lion's share of the plunder.
  Then there are conscripts, draftees, penal companies.  For all of
these it's definitely about them individually, as they had some
authority telling them to fight or lose their personal liberty
(through imprisonment or simply death).
  Although I certainly agree with the base premise, that in DAoC,
you're going to get the most enjoyment if you look at it as truly
Realm vs. Realm and not me vs him.
