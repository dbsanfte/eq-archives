All I can suggest is patience - as a wizard, you CAN kite, for
starters, just not as early as Druids.  Secondly, when I initially
started playing a wizard, I hard time finding groups.  Until I
*finally* scored groups a few times.  THEN the people in those groups
quickly became wizard converts, as every mob we fought basically got
tanked to about half hp, then boom, it was dead.  A wizard in a group
makes for very fast kills - it's just a matter of edjucating people to
the fact.

So, just because I leave a camp, and you find it empty,
you think it's yours?
