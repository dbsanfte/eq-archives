There are some people that have thought these things out and made
good cases for their arguements, if you study their arguements
and agree, then you should adopt their conclusions as your own. 
But people, even famous philosphers, do end up differing on
details... if you want to see some hairs split, try reading up on
current conclusions people are making regarding various things
the american founding fathers thought were "self evident truths".

It is a charming idea, and one that seems to be a central tennent
in one wording or another in just about every major religion.  Is
it sufficiently universal as to be a universal more, though?  If
so, is it possible to derive a moral stance on every single issue
that will ever arise, based solely on that one idea?  This sort
of question is the kind that keeps philosophers up nights and
working weekends.

Yep, its really a good one, probably why it appears in so many
widely spread philosophical and theological sources.

How about to not use a spell checker?

No, thats just a joke.  You might try to make a case that its
immoral to be disrespectful, my point is that the Pope presumably
endorses little quibbles like the commandment not to take the
name of god in vain, if -he- does so he's breaking his own code.

Its not?  News to me.  I could sure as hell walk out of
restaurants I never intend to come back to without leaving any
tip at all.  Its not illegal, there are no consequences to me for
not doing it.  Why do I leave the tip then?  I've already had the
service, so despite someone saying that "tips" stands for "to
insure prompt service" its not going to do a damn bit of good as
the service was either prompt or not already.  I say that its a
moral issue, in fact the simplest and clearest kind of moral
issue you are ever going to find, in part because there's no
confusing it with a religious issue.

Yep, ignore them all, I say, if YOU feel its ok, its moral, then
for you it is moral, just as if the pope feels it isn't, yet
participates anyway, he's NOT being moral.

Having known a good many prostitutes in my younger days (when I
used to date a pro... not pay for one, mind you, but instead was
the "boyfriend" a surprising number of working women have on the
side) I can say that these stereotypes do apply in a few cases,
but certainly not in most, not even in many.  Economics are
responsible for a good deal more of the trade than anything else,
that and society's placement of women on a lower pay scale than
men.  Power for women, particularly in lower economic
circumstances, often seems to be available most easily in the
form of their gender.  Drug dependance and violence are generally
the stuff of the media and pulpit, far more important are factors
like insanely high college tuition costs, unbearably high levels
of credit card debt, or the inability to work in a "mundane" job
for wages high enough to pay for a babysitter.

The "high class escort" is not driven by these things, so much as
for real wealth, accumulating tens, hundreds of thousands of
dollars over a span of a few years and then retiring, much as a
professional athelete does, spending his valuable young physical
potential to earn high dollars fast, then try to convert that
into a second carreer which would probably be impossible without
the punch of those big dollars.  

But that arguement aside, the question is what the sonafoabitch
believes is going on.  If he thinks the woman is there by choice
and exercising her free will despite (or in some states and
countries, with the consent of) the legal situation, and he
doesn't see anything wrong with spending cash directly on sex
instead of on dinner and a movie (which can cost as much but are
of far less economic benefit to the lady.. and while more
sporting is a far less certain proposition), then for him its not
immoral; it doesnt violate his own considered beliefs.

Might he come to different conclusions if he had better
information?  Yes indeed he might, particularly if you are
correct about the provenence of his 'ho.  If he then continued to
see the lady anyway, would he then be immoral doing the same act
that was earlier moral?  Yes indeed, he'd now be violating his
moral strictures rather than working within them.

But the fact that someone else believes something which may not
even be true about his situation doesn't have any impact I can
see on whether he's operating morally.  Legally, yes, to be
sure.  But thats different.
