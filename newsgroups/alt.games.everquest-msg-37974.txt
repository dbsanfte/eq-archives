at 19 you could head back to everfrost to try for mammoth/icy orc groups. 
Mammoth tusks sell for 8-10 pp depending on cha and faction.  Icy orcs
frequently drop fine steel weapons, as well as fair coin.  You WILL need some
way of breaking the spawn at icy orcs, ie harmony.  Unrest is another option,
though on my server it has been dead of late (all puns intended).  Not sure if
that is due to the opening of Stonebrunt Mtns or the gradual emptying of
dungeons for the "safer" outdoor experience of LOIO to OT to DL that has been
happening since Kunark was released.

I personally can't stand LOIO but that is a personal choice.

I usually practice pickpocket on green mobs when my normal group isn't around or
while waiting for a pickup group.  I did most of my skill ups in Everfrost off
of goblin camps.  After I got up higher in levels, I pickpocketed Orcs while
pulling Mammoths for my group.  There are some who when using master loot rules
will have the rogue doing the master loot, and then they can split what they
pickpocket as well.  Then there are the rogues who give the rest of us a bad
name, and are why we had such a horrible time finding groups for a while that
just pick a mob as clean as they can and to hell with their group mates.
