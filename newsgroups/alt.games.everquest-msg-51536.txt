13/20, AC5, 5 to all stats/resists, some hps/mana.  Drops off random
crap in ST, killable with one group.  It's close, sure as hell less
tedious to get than the druid epic.

The sprinkler drops off probably the easiest (or maybe the second
easiest) dragon in ToVN.  30 people can trivially drop him *AND* get
other fairly decent loots, not the least of which is that stupid
silver chains.

>And those four would be?

Freebringer - too easy NOT to get it and the +ATK on it means even
rogues with access to better weapons will opt to at the very least
offhand this poker.

Snake on a stick - haste buffs cost a LOT of mana.  Manafree haste
buff means you need a bare minimum of enchanters per raid to get every
meleer haste capped.

Rez stick - for the obvious reasons.

Bards - mainly because they whine a lot if you don't get it for them.
