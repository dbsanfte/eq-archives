Actually, the crushbone throneroom is SUPPOSED to be well beyond the
capabilites of a single level 8 toon, but these days the bazaar throws off
everything under level 50 pretty severely. TR mobs range as high as 18-22
iirc. Btw, that noob armor is a waste of time.

You said you weren't there to have fun, if that's the case I recommend you
try a new game. No insult intended.
