Well I got my EverQuest deluxe edition from Amazon yesterday,
which did have a tutorial by the way!
Installed it, read the book, did the tutorial and after some
problems opened an account.

My bad luck they were busy doing a patch on all servers I 
suppose but after that my Barbarian Shaman spent bloody hours 
stumbling around in the dark trying to find Margyn at the 
Church of the Tribunal ( that candle is no good at all ) and
I keptlosing the connection with annoying regularity and ending 
up back in Windows Desktop.

Now today just about to have another go when I get a "system
message" that all servers would be down for another three hours.
After that I could`nt even get on Chat it was so congested!

I am still waiting for this addiction to kick in!, I am very
frustrated but addicted NO!!  :-))))

Percy.
