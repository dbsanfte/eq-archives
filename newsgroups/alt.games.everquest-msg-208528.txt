    I think you missed my sarcasm. I don't agree with all the whiners
complaining
about the loot, I think they're nuts. Let's go through them one by one,
shall we?

    Chain bracer: 210 HPs/200 MANA, more than any other bracer by what, 10%?
Has a stackable stun resist mod that works on all stuns, including spells, a
stackable
+ATK mod in Accuracy, and the fastest general spell haste mod in game. The
shaman that gets this bracer takes away spell haste and stun resist as
invaluable foci,
a rogue gets stun resist and accuracy, and a ranger gets spell haste and
accuracy.
So every class listed takes away two useful foci and 10% more HPs/MANA.
That's not even counting things like the 15 all resists, which is pretty
exceptional
with modern top-end gear (most of it is highly weighted to one or two
resists,
leaving people with "weak resists"). No chain class would prefer two other
bracers
to this one except if they're locked into unique foci in that slot.

    Ethereal Silk Leggings: 220 HPs/225 MANA, increases of nearly 50% over
what
the character would likely be wearing. Best general spell haste in game (not
available
on non-Quarm loot), stackable stun resist, and a large avoidance factor
which pushes
the effective AC up well beyond what a silk class normally gets. The useful
foci is the
spell haste, although some classes like enchanter will also benefit from the
stun resist
and avoidance. Of the four classes listed on the legs, wizards would likely
not want
this item, but necromancers, mages, and enchanters would not wear anything
other than
this.

    Hammer of the Timeweaver: again, 10% more HPs than other weapons. This
is the
weakest of the items I've seen, depending on how much DPS the proc pets do,
but
it still has an exceptional ratio and the proc isn't an aggro-magnet like
other weapons
with stun procs. Of the six classes listed on it, it would at least be the
best available offhand
for monks, BSTs, rogues, and rangers, mod foci. (If I had to tinker with it,
I'd give it an
accuracy mod.)

    The Shroud has a shielding mod on it, and a large one at that. Enough
said. Shielding
is worth every DKP you need to spend to get it.

    So, a bracer that every chain character would want, legs that three of
the four classes
that can use them would want, a cloak that would be a wet dream for pretty
much
everyone short of silk classes, and an offhand weapon that would be wanted
by 4 of the 6
classes that can use it. This stuff is the best of the best, as it should
be.

    James
