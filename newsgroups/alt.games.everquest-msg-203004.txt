Shrug, I assume those would be the same people would only take a melee
if he was a twink. I still pull out my cleric occasionally, he's been
parked in DL, stuck in the high 30s, low 40s for about 2 years now,
got ask once that entire time if I had KEI when I looked for a group.
My answer was, 'Sorry dood, I'm not in the mood to group with anyone
that feels the need to ask that question.' Basically the same answer I
give with my warrior if people ask him whether he's twinked. 

Rgds, Frank
