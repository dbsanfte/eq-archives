I went to the Naggy raid post and entered my name.  They have a pretty 
decent run down of what they want you to do and what they need to have 
show up before they will go, written up nicely; this is confidence 
inspiring.

I farmed HG this morning to the tune of 827pp, and then went this 
afternoon and blew that all on gear to get my unbuffed SvM and SvF up 
over 100.  Nice thing is, almost all the gear is an actual upgrade that 
I'll wear every day; this is the benefit of mostly ignoring gear and 
still being in newbie junk, Anything is an upgrade!

I'm wondering which pet I should use for this, 49 fire pet, 52 fire pet 
would both presumably have best fire resists, but use fire based DD 
(well I'm not sure what the 52 fire pet uses actually...but I'm thinking 
he's right out since he annuls and does something with knockback)  I 
could run my usual, the 50 MS II pet, keep casting him till I get one 
who has the FireElementalAura, which should boost his fire resist and do 
a bit of damage if he ends up getting aggro.  Or I could run 49 water, 
which might do more DD damage, or even go nuts with the 49 air... 
although Naggy is immune to stuns like most giants and dragons I assume, 
or even 49 or 51 Earth, but the odds of an entire raid enjoying randomly 
on and off again root aggro mode seems low.

The SvM gear will also be useful for Vox, but I'll have to look at a few 
changes in order to emphasize SvC instead of SvF.

Splendid One, 52 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
