O.k. just for fun, here's my impression of best to worst in the ability
of tanking.  In this case I'm defining Tanking as the ability to stand
in front of a mob and take a whoopin' least inpacting a healer's mana. 
Who's going to live the longest when the AoW or whatnot starts beating
on them like they were a red headed stepchild.  From best to worst:

Plate Wearin' TANKS!:
1 Warrior
2 Shadowknight (I put them #2 instead of paladin only because there are
no Large Pallys)
3 Paladin

Hybrid/Mele Types: (I'm not too sure on these)
4 Bard
5 Ranger
6 Beastlord
7 Monk
8 Rogue

Wiz Casters:
9 Cleric
10 Shaman
11 Druid (almost belongs down with the Int Casters)

Pussy Int Casters:
12 Enchanter
13 Necromancer
14 Wizard
15 Mage

Please post with your dissagreements, what you would change and why.
