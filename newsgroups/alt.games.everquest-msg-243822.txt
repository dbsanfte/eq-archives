Were you upset with my use of the word "bullshit"?  Well, I'm sorry.  It's
still a semantic dodge, used in an attempt to change the topic of
discussion.  And the funny thing about it is that you've claimed that you're
arguing this as a devil's advocate, so why so sensitive in the first place?
Why so unwilling to discuss this or even concede it if you admit there's
nothing you can respond with?  Heh, you're doing it again!  Citing the one
obscenity in a message that was a few hundred words long and going off on
how rude that was and how I'm ruining the discussion by being unreasonable
and uncivil.

Seeing that you're a usenet veteran, I find that rather peculiar.  It's not
as if I was insulting you or spraying obscenities.  You used a dubious
debate tactic.  I called you on it, and now you use your next dubious debate
tactic, self-righteousness followed by a concession, presumably not because
you can't answer my response adequately, but because I'm "sullying" the
discussion with one word that's hardly ever out of place in usenet.

You're being a drama queen.

There you go again.  And I thought the whole point of playing the devil's
advocate was that it _wasn't_ your personal position.  I acknowledged this
from the beginning.

This is a wonderful example of usenet evasion, defensiveness, and
hardheadedness.  No acknowledgement of "you're right, Charles.  The loot one
acquires in EQ is not a function of the time spent acquiring it", just a
defensive attack and an attempt to bow out of the discussion with your pride
intact.  Yes, of course, _I'm_ the one being unreasonable here.

I really expected better of you, Rumbledor.  I've enjoyed your postings and
thought you had a cogent viewpoint on a number of EQ issues, but this, this
is just sad.
