This is probably your best bet if you are patient. We had to wait in
line behind other groups when we were camping the mage. And when you've
got that camp, you usually pull the hand room just to stave off the
boredom. (Assuming the lord room camp isn't pulling it.) Once everyone
has a ring, we were letting them rot. I'd think your chances are good of
either getting to loot one, or possibly (if You REALLY want to attempt
this battle) having the campers let you pull the hand solo if they have
the spawn split. If that's the case, you could just swim down to the
room below (and the short hallway that connects the hand area to the
main hall where the pit trap is) and fight him there without worrying
about adds.  However, I'll agree with some others who posted and say
that I think the Hand will totally own you. I know I couldn't come close
to taking him solo with my warrior at 54 without one or two CHeals. Yes,
you have other tools as a ranger, but the Hand's MR is fairly high, and
if you get a bunch of resists, with your AC and HP, I think you'll be
toast pretty fast. And the run to the zone is No Fun from there. ;-)
