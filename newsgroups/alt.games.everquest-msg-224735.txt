Yea that's the way it feels to me too (though I've switched from doing
old-world soloing to a lot of LDoN adventures at least for now). In fact I
recently left my guild, without rancor, simply because they are playing one
game and I'm playing a different one, and my real-life schedule will never
allow me to play theirs.

There have been a couple of times over the last two years that I had decided
to quit EQ, actually did quit for a couple months once, because it felt like
the high-end raiding game was ultimately the only really satisfying gaming
experience that EQ would offer. I'm actually pretty impressed with the job
the developers have done the least year or two in growing and fleshing out
the "two EQs" -- the serious raiding players such as my former guild seem to
be busy and happy, and now so am I playing the game I enjoy. All in the same
gameworld.
