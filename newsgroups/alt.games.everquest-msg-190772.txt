    Sure. 3 people have just written in to say how wrong I am - but having
taunted mobs off people and done no damage whatsoever to powerlevel the
person doing the damage, and discovered that they get no experience when I
do this, I do not agree with those three people.

    Similarly, I can do 90% or 99% of the damage to a mob, and feign death,
and the lowbie who does the 10%, or the 1%, gets full experience.
