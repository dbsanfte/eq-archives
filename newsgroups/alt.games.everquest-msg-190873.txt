Yeah, I really liked them.

Heh, when I first started EQ I was playing a bard, and had no clue
what a mage pet was.  I was out in EC for the first or 2nd time and
saw someone run by with this weird orange/black monster on their
heals - I took off running after him to help while targetting the
monster, Jibober.  I said "Hey, wait, I'll help you kill that
thing!"  He turns around and looks, "Kill what thing?"  "That
orange thing - Jibober"  "HAHAHAHAH, that's my PET!"  "Oh"

Heh, back then f8 would give you someone's pet if it was the
nearest NPC.
