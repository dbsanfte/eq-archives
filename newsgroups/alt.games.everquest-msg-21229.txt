A much quicker way for guard faction is to get a few stacks of treant
wood shards (hand a small lantern for each shard to Jyle Windshot
upstairs in the Hogcaller Inn in WFP - they're tradable so a mule can do
this now you're KOS, alternatively buy them from treant killers).

Give these to Emil Parsini in the hut in Tox right outside Erudin. He is
supposed to take 1 treant wood shard as part of some Erudin Cleric/Pally
quest (peacekeeper staff maybe?), but you can do this faction-building
bit over and over by getting your treant wood elsewhere. Raises Erudin
guard, council and merchant faction. That'll get you inside Erudin, but
you'll need to have fixed your faction in the caster guilds to actually
do the potion quest, as stated in a previous message, by killing the
wimpy necro at the dock or whatever. Perhaps there is some way to
balance the Heretic hit that this will give if you're a necro, I don't
know (other than killing hundreds of kobolds).

You'll need to do the potion quest hundreds of times to build FP militia
faction, so you should contrive a way to get the 2 NPCs you need to deal
with standing next to each other. For example, as a druid, I could whack
Slansin, run upstairs to Toresian, root Slansin when he gets there, port
out to Tox to get off his hate list, then gate back before root breaks
and he wanders off. A cleric or enchanter could use atone/memblur. Once
they're together, you can hotkey all the phrases and just mindlessly
hand potions from one to the other over and over (top down view helps
here), hailing Slansin every few times to stop him wandering off.

Bear in mind also that there's 2 Slansins, the real one and the imposter
one (who gives all the nice shady faction hits), so if you get the wrong
one you may have to kill him a few times until the fake Slansin
spawns...
