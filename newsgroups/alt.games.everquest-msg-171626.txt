Not *lost*, not really.  Your equipment is on your corpse... you just have
to find your corpse and loot it, just like you would loot a monster you've
just killed.

Yup.  Anything you put in any bank is available from any other bank anywhere
in the game.  That's what makes banks so convenient.

XP is *only* gained by having a sufficiently high-level cleric or paladin
ressurect you.  (Ressurection is usually shortened as "rez" in the game,
i.e. "/ooc Can I get a cleric to rez my corpse, please?")  Even a very
high-level necro can ressurect you, although it costs them dearly, so
they're extremely unlikely to do so except in extreme circumstances.

However, at level 10, it's really not worth the trouble of getting a rez.
It will only take one or two kills to get back the XP you lost by dying.
This will prove to be true all the way through your 20's - it's usually not
worth the bother of trying to find a rez.

Yes, I suppose you could do it that way.  Awfully inconvenient, if you ask
me, to have to store your equipment, run, and re-equip on the other side.
But yeah, it's absolutely safe to do it that way.

Better, though, is to learn the zones and find a safe way to get to where
you need to go.  For example, in Kithicor Forest you're usually fairly safe
hugging the walls of the zone, even at night.  As long as you go *all* the
way up the walls, as high as you can, then creep around the edge until
you're above the entrance to RV, you should be pretty safe.

Learning how to navigate dangerous zones will be an important skill for you
later in the game, so you may as well get started now.

Hope that helps.  =)  Come ask questions any time, we're here to help.
