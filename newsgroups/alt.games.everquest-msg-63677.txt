It's a warning to others that they may well spout incomprehensible
pseudo-Shakesperean English at the earliest opportunity.

A warning that you may have to ask them questions four or five times, before
they finally get so frustrated with your inability to understand them, that
they agree to answer in plain English.

Sometimes it's a chance to perpetuate the myth that ogres and trolls have no
education system whatsoever, and can only converse at the level of a five
year old.

Have they never heard of the famous literary troll, Blatto Morskick, who won
the Southern Norrath Prize for Philosophy 5 years in a row!

Or Oggle the Ogre who co-wrote the 34 volume set of "Eclectic Thinking and
Buttock Scratching"?
