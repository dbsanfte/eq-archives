I totally agree. I am a "casual" player at this moment, maybe playing a
maximum of 10 hours a week, usually a lot less. I have had times that I
haven't played EQ for weeks, just because i was too busy doing other shit.
My guess is that ANY game gets boring if you play it so much that you do not
have an active social life anymore.

I have had one or two weekends in the past where i decided to make it an EQ
marathon (Wife away on business), and i usually found myself NOT playing for
at least a week after that. Sometimes its nice, but not all the time, all
the way.

I have a 27 shaman, a 14 wizard, a 13 bard, a 10 warrior, a 6 druid, a 6
necro and 2 empty slots, in which i will probably create a few more chars. I
found that playing different characters give me different insights in the
game. I have been playing for almost a year now, and 27 is all i got. I
probably won't get to lvl 40 before Luclin is out, and perhaps then the
gameplay will be different.

Roleplaying is not easy in Everquest....I think roleplaying should be more
developed. Also, the difference in the races is not too great. Maybe they
ahould make the differnent races a lot more different.... perhaps even a
language barrier that needs to be crossed before you can speak to a
different race.

Agreed. I do think (being used to IRC) that they should revise the chat
system so it calls for a more easy way of handling tells and group and guild
chat. One option is to open a different window for each, that can be
minimized if you don't use them, and just blink or so when someone said
something. So at least you can chat a lot easier.

I am thinking about traveling. My shaman has been stuck on Kunark for ages
now, because i felt there is nothing better. I have traveled back and forth
to Halas for my 24 spells (usign a porter to get me to NK, and back to BB so
i only had to take the boat to FV once) and I had the greatest fun helping
newbies in BlackBurrow and Everfrost. I killed the gnoll that carries the
runed totem staff (if it still does i don't know) like 4 times and gave out
the staffs.

Everquest is not all about experience and leveling, it can also be great fun
just to check out other area's. I have promptly decided to get my shaman out
of LOIO and i will buy a port to... hell i don't know yet. :))

Further more i think EQ could be enhanced with one or two zones which are
multi-server accesible. In other words, everyone of all servers can enter
this zone and chat with eachother. Perhaps cross-server trade could even be
made possible, in a limited way.

Also, not too long ago I was in Oasis of Mar, and a named spectre was
roaming the area. It was lower leveled then the average spectre, and it
conned as "indifferently" so it would not agro until attacked. It dropped
something too but i forgot.... A few weeks ago the tunnels to Nro were
crawling  with undeads, at least 40 or 50 of em. Perhaps Verant could
include more of these irregularities to make the game a little more
intresting.
