Assuming you have a stamina of 100 or more the only penalty in combat to a
drained stamina bar is that you can no longer jump... and I can't think of many
combat tactics that involve jumping.

If you don't have a stamina of 100 or more, investing in some stamina gear or
restarting the character might be things to look at, because no healer wants to
waste a spell slot and the mana on casting stamina replentishment spells just
because you are playing a wimp.
