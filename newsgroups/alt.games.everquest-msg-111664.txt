That's the wrong impression.  The recent changes were made to
stop the case where a cleric would turn in their pearl, spawn the
dragon, and wipe out.  Another guild would then kill the dragon,
loot the heart, and the first cleric would have to redo the parts of
the epic required to get back to the Ragefire step.  That doesn't
happen anymore:  a wipeout on the dragon (and subsequent kill
by another guild) just means you have to try again.

The move to Skyfire itself was done to both raise the difficulty (the
dragon version is now higher-level) and to eliminate the "camp"
part of the epic.  Unless your server has agreed on some camp
rights for the Skyfire version, Ragefire is now pure FCFS.  There's
no PnP issues (hich were possible before the change) hours or
even days before the spawn.  Ragefire is, in essence, just another
Kunark dragon.  One warrior -- or one group -- can't claim Sev.
The same is true for one cleric claiming Ragefire.  Anyone trying to
invoke PnP gets the FCFS mantra.

The only real change in timing was the elimination of the need to
kill Naggy.  Since Naggy had to be killed before Ragefire had a
chance to spawn (and because most clerics at that stage *can't*
kill Naggy), they eliminated the potential bottleneck.  Imagine
being the uber guild on your server and not having enough alts to
kill Naggy and spawn a two-group dragon...

Spawn rate is wholly dependent upon the rate they want the
Epic entering the game.   The list of people who want it isn't
relevant at all.   Take the Fungi tunic, for instance:  highly
desired, even more than the cleric epic, I'd bet.  Should the
drop rate for it be adjusted so that everyone who wants one
can get one in a month or two?

Uh, three hour spawn for three days is, even with an hour to
prep/kill/loot, six a day *at least* or 18, not 9.  Unless I'm
missing something...   There's no way Ragefire would take
that long to kill:   I've seen a guild port in two groups, kill him,
loot, and port out in under 12 minutes....

Verant wants the cleric epic, arguably the most valuable to guilds
in the game, to enter once or twice a week, at most.   It's doing that.
There *isn't* a problem from their point-of-view.  Not every player in
every class can get all the uber weapons, spells, or armor.  The epic
is no different.

(And I'm #2 on my guild's short list.  FCFS servers have their good
points.  So do guilds that can mobilize two or three groups quickly
enough, even at off hours, to take FCFS spawns like Ragefire.)
