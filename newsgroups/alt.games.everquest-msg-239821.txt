Actually.....here on planet earth where I live in the good old USA, I'm
given 2 15 minute breaks and an hour for lunch for every 8 hours of
work I perform.  And during those 1.5 hours per day I am free to do
anything I would like so long as it's not illegal or immoral.  That
does BTW include surfing messageboards/newsgroups/reading email.  

On a personal note, my company doesn't block any of my access, so I
wasn't speaking for myself.  I use gigabyte at home and at the office
to read my newsgroups.

/shrug  I said I wouldn't come back, but I forgot to unsubscribe from
the thread on the boards, so it lets me know whenever someone responds
and well, I love Ogmuk to death so I had to come see what he said  :)

Unsubscribing now though because it seems some people are just bound
and determined to be rude to any/everyone.  Personally, there are
enough random jerks in the world that I have to deal with to make me
involve myself with more intentionally.
