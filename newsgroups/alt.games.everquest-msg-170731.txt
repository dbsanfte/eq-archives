I see two entirely different issues here. 1) a bad group: no assist,
unorganized, loot problems and 2) dungeon crawling. The first issue would be
a problem no matter what was being hunted in whichever way. The second is a
style of hunting I myself much prefer over camping a room. Dungeon crawling
requires more attention, skill, whatever you want to call it than simply
sitting in a room waiting for mobs to be brought to you and is a lot more
fun. I just wish there were more HS style of dungeons in the game. I have no
idea what you mean by a language barrier.
