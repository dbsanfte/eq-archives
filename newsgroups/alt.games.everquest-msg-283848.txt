Thank you, M, for the voice of "been there, seen that, done that."

Chorkie, with all her flaws, vented here to get a load off and didn't really 
understand that the Usenet tolerates little when it comes to generalities. 
She had a bad day of healin' Ldons.  I was there, I know, I'm her warrior. 
Her flaws?  Yep, the worst of them are about caring for the group.  Oh, and 
the timing, I just showed her the Usenet.

Can I explain?

In the mission she was most upset about, we had some real winners.  Hey, I 
mean YOU could learn something here too.  Like the Druid.  Not only did the 
guy step on her heals, but used the evac succor to bring back splintered 
group.  Here's the lesson on that, don't expect to use the exit if'n you're 
succored in that manner!  It's a hellish experience.  Some of the group had 
gotten there via feets, some by succor.  Feets could gate out, the others 
.... an agonizing death.  Was the Druid wrong?  So, tawk amongst yourselves 
... does a succor get ya some kind of penalty with a zone?  I've seen it.

Was the Druid wrong?

In this case, yes.  On a case by case basis, all are different.  This Druid 
could do nothing right.  In the end, we regretted inviting that one.  Hasn't 
it happened to you?  I mean, how many times do you put together a group 
allowing a mix of unknowns in, and wind up with ONE that disappoints?  It 
happens.  Isn't there always ONE?

"Hey, I think I need to get my adventurer's stone"

How about this one ...

"Can I be leader?  I sur do needs me some lleeeder points?"

Chork got it good, and backed me up, always.  We've had stellar success, yet 
in a way the failures still glow.  We try to improve.  She's asleep now, and 
will think I'm butting in, as you probably will, or worse.  The thing I want 
you to know ... friends ... she's a good Cleric, there's always room to 
learn, and she's all mine.

Peace.

 Vinae
