You would think so wouldn't you?
We have shamans with over 1400AC buffed.  Against any dragon in ToV,
he dies in less than 3 seconds everytime when he overaggros with a
debuff.

At those encounters, no caster can get their AC high enough to make a
difference.

Hell, even those non-name chain flurrying defenders can plow through a
caster with 1200AC almost as fast as death touch.
