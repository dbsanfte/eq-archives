Aye - had it happen to me at the bottom of Splitpaw, went down there to meet
SK friend. I had See Invis up (on neck item) and was able to track to him.
Got to romm where he was fighting the Ichval, and I could see the MOB
flailing away, but no friend. I could target him by assisting th MOB, but it
was very strange. Anyway, camping out and returning fixed it.
