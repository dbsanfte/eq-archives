Packets are sent with headers and footers. A NAT server adds an additional
header and footer to identify the new IP (basically hiding the originating
host from the destination host). When the packet is returned it still has
the originating host's header and footer, the NAT server recognizes which
local IP matches that info and sends it to the right machine.

Someone told me a bizarre analogy about a person moving from room to room in
a building. Each time they enter a room they put a jacket on over the jacket
they are wearing. When they get to where they are going they turn around and
come back the same way, discarding jackets till they get back to where they
started.

Techies are weird.
