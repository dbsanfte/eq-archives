It can actually be pretty useful to seperate one mob from a pack.
Snare or dark it and it won't move back to it's spawn point until the
snare wears off. Anyone tested to see if all dots work that way?
Doesn't change the fact that anyone trying it at a busy zone line like
KC is an inconsiderate idiot. 

Always work under the assumption that if you're minding your own
business and a mob starts beating on you, you have the right to kill
it no matter how that mob got there. Same goes for a train at a zone
line, if you're there and somebody trains out you have every right to
kill the train. Anyone that argues with either of those, I shrug off
as an idiot.
