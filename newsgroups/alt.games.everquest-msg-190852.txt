You head due North, zone into Qeynos Hills, and it's along the East
side of the Qeynos Hills zone, north of the entrance to the Karanas
and just south of the entrance to Surefall Glade.

Or in laymans terms, go to the junction in Qeynos hills which has
signposting for Qeynos and Karanas, take the path to the karanas, but
don't zone into them, follow the edge of the Qeynos hills zone line
north to find the entrance.

The entrance to the burrows is supposedly just about okay for level 5
players, though I think as there are scouts as opposed to just pups
there, level 6 or 7 may be better. I hear it gets more difficult if
you actually enter the burrows.
