Aye, understood, as I said, I am solo outdoors only, no real aim, just enjoy
playing on my own sometimes, not fussed about raids, planes etc, my druid is
here for solo fun : )     I know quite a few people now who take this same
approach, tired of the hack n slash exp grind, so sit back and whack
something unkillable by a similar level other class, with ya yummy druid : )
No worries about trains, aggro etc, just sat on the grass watching a mob die
from a nasty DoT.

I do intend to have a viable character, as you put it, just not my druid : )
I feel a lot more comfortable in a dungeon, when I have a pair of swords in
hand  : )

Since this thread started, I have looked at my defence skill etc, and yes
they are fairly low, but they aren't that bad, about 55 (average) from max,
god knows how they got up that high, as I have hardly been hit at all.  My
kit has some good ac between the various bits, maybe half elf druids ac
sucks, dunno ?  Still don't care : ) <grins>
