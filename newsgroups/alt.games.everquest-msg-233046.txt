Yes, when I said you cannot enter under another guilds session I meant you
cannot raid with another guild/raid after you create your session with your
own guild/raid (or vice versa), it doesnt apply to guild tag

Instancing is different atm tho, it used to be tied to each character, now
its tied to a specific raid. So if you reform your raid inside (e.g to make
special groups for certain mobs) you can no longer zone back in, on day 1 or
2, from PoTime A or the GY.

We deliberatly keep time to 2 days, just to try and cut down on the mulling
around, target finding practise. 3 time guilds and 3 elemental guilds means
"worthwhile" gods don't stay up long, elemental raids are pointless (1/4 to
1/3 of PoTime loot rots as it is..) even Fennin loot rots more often than
not (last 2 kills, 5 of 6 loots rotted each time)

Ldon... heh

> Who ever came up with most of those should be fired.

You mean you don't enjoy 32 man encounters, after your guild had to recruit
for 72 to clear PoTime?
Or events with 3k hitting mobs, death limits and other such annoying
"features"?
The 32 doesn't even break down nicely across classes when you need 50% of
the raid to be cleric/warrior to have a decent shot at success..

3 hours of trash clearing, before getting absolutely wasted by the named,
then a 5 day wait on trying the theme again..

Who could not enjoy Ldon raids...

I haven't read too much of the high-end GoD aspects yet, being on beta
doesn't help when you crash at the character select screen 100% of the
time... /bleh

From whats been said of the cragbeast queen (60 potime peeps unable to beat
her regen), it looks as if at least not all of it will be instanced crap

Reforming a raid
Being in the GY during another sessions clearing
Being unable to enter on day 2 if you missed day 1
People who haven't raided in 2 weeks, still being atuned to another
instance..
We had a guild here locked out of potimeb for 2 weeks because of an unended
instance
Oh and melee discs being deleted when you zone in/out of some instanced
zones

1hr 15 mins for Phase 3

The instance wouldn't be atuned to the new guilds raid, so clicking in
PoTimeA would just not port them anyway.
