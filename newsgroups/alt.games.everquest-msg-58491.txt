Given that I put these items on skeletons and orc pawns so newbies can
find them, rather than waste my time trying to auction them, I don't
think you can classify this as "very" stupid.

I wouldn't give anything truely valuable to a character under 6th level
just because I've seen corpse decay while bugged too many times
in characters that low.  But spending the tiny amount of plat on
a full set of storebought leathers and handing him a 10pp weapon I'd
otherwise throw away?  Yes, I can do that.

At 6th, you can give him actual Twink gear in relative safety, the body
won't decay all that fast, he's still fighting near his bind point, and
he really won't be sub ten long anyway!
