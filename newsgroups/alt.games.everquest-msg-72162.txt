"This task is impossible" will be interpreted by the vast majority of
people that the task in question is impossible, period, no matter who
attempts it. "This task is impossible FOR ME" will be interpreted as
the task in question is impossible for the person in question
attempting it.

Assumption, perhaps, but an assumption that will be shared by the
majority of those reading the statement.

Now, point is, "SOL made EQ unplayable!" is a whine. "SOL made EQ
unplayable on my system" is a complaint.
