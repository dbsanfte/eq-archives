	Sorry, but in America it doesn't work that way.  Public utilities in
particular and corporations in general can't just go and do what they want and
"to hell with everyone".  Environmentalcases have often gotten public works
projects delayed, substantially modified or cancelled outright -- in fact,
they can often do so trivially.  They wield tremendous power because anyone
criticising them is instantly vilified, thus it's very difficult to find
anyone who will speak out agains them.  

	30 years ago, they were old-fashioned public utilities.  It was another
breed of liberal whacko, consumer advocates, who overturned that particular
apple cart.
