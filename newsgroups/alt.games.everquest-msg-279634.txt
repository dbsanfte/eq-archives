Sometimes it's easy to label someone as "Uber".

For example: I know a Cleric who has so many AAs she makes God
jealous. And if you've ever heard the "Clerics can't solo" she'll
prove you wrong. (She solos better than almost anyone I know.)

Another example: I know a Ranger than has more HP/AC mitigation than
all but the top four plate tanks in our raiding alliance. He can tank
any single or double group content you care to name, as well or better
than any plate tank I know.

But what about us mere mortals? When can we hope to achieve the title
of "Uber"?

What do you consider the criteria of "Uberness"?
