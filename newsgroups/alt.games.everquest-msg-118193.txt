Lots of combo's are good and it depends on what you like and want to do.
If you want to go places I'd advice druid with some melee (pally or sk I
think is best) because druids can port.

If you want to try dungeon crawling as well as hunt outside go for monk /
shammie. The combination is awesome considering both classes are very
versatile. SK / shammie is also very good (the FD is needed in dungeons if
you don't have crowd control)

If you mostly want to stick to outside places try some combination of the
unholy trinity mage / druid / necro. each can solo well and is a powerhouse
combined with one of the others. Mage / necro is really awesome for what
I've seen of those.

If you want to invite others and make more general groups go for warrior /
cleric. It's the basis of most groups and any class can be added to enhance
it's efficiency.

And if you want fun, go for 2 wizard gnomes. The nukage is terrifying and if
you play in the same room you can double kite (normal quadkite, but with 2
wizards nuking the mobs to bits. You need to time the nukes and run the same
direction which is hard if you don't have other means of communication
besides chat)


Oh well, just pick something you'd like to play.
