Typically, there are three very good choices for Specialization. If you're a
die-hard soloist, Conjuration is probably the best choice since you will be
Root-DOT-Medding for your entire "career." -On raids DOTs are rarely allowed
since in emergencies you can't mez a DOTed mob...

If you're more inclined to group, Alteration is easily the best. It controls
your healing, restoration spells (Restoring Stamina, Curing Poison, Disease,
etc), Snaring, Rooting, Ports/Evacs, and some buffs (particularly STR).

And if you really want a blend of the two, Evocation. Evocation controls all
of the "fun" spells. You'll be able to DD and multi-kite a little more
efficiently solo, and bluntly, in the groups it's mainly your role to deal
damage while falling back to the defensive position if no one is able to
fill that role.

Personally, I chose Evocation as it allows flexibility in groups and out.
Note that from 39-49 you presumably will be Root-DOT-Medding as your DDs
just aren't efficient enough, but if you can make it through those levels, I
have to highly recommend Evocation.
