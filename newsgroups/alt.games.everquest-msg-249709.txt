Well... i'll knee jerk the other way.. they'd have to be 10 shades of
stupid not to. A lot of the problem is the conservatism that runs
through the NG and gaming in general... there are a lot of backward
thinking people that really can't see the forest through the trees.

Here is a question.. if you could walk into a bank and setup a secure
gaming account from which you could access from any game, would you?
Keeping in mind this would have nothing to do with your normal
accounts.. its simply a new account for which you can transfer money
in as needed, with its own ATM card and all the jazz that comes along
with a normal account.
