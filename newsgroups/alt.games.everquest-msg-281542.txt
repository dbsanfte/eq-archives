Play being group with 2 afk people and solo the WC mission over and over
and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ...

Or Play being group with 2 afk people and solo the BB mission over ... and
well you get it.

Or group with 2 people who are there and 3-toon the first 2 freemind
missions relentlessly over and over and over without more than a few
moments downtime.

I like the orc mission, because it requires team work and because it's not
something you can just have one person complete while 5 people sit afk and
earn xp.

They need to be rebalanced so that they are challenging for groups of
people and provide fun and entertainment, not an AA factory for people on a
24x7 rotation with no risk.
