It does indeed spawn outside the door of the dungeon once the timer goes
off. Dead or alive, it gets bumped out. I waited for my corpse to get booted
from the dungeon in Guk instead of running around trying to find it in
there. It did take almost five minutes from the time the dungeon went down
to when the corpse appeared outside though.
