Grow up? Listen to yourself? As you suggest, both parties are in a position
of forced trust, so don't be bad mouthing folks for failing to do what you
are failing to do - trust.

For me, it's a simple matter of material loss. I usually have the coin on my
cursor before the plat happens, but I now do not generally pay before the
port or the TL window pops up. I used to pay in advance occasionally, but
the caster is not the only person at risk - I once had someone agree to give
me wolf form for 20pp. I paid in advance, and they gated out.

Couple of things:
"Port for 'donations'". The word "donations" implies that it is voluntary -
both the deed, but particularly the amount. If you expect a specific amount
for services, then that would be more properly referred to as a "fee".
"Suggested Donations" are common, but if they are required, then they are
not, by definition, a donation.
The material loss is to the person donating the cash. Mana regens itself.
It's a loss of time, but fact is most porters will gain back the mana in the
time that they make the quick shout for porting at the new destiation (if
they are doing that). The primary loss of time is not in the mana regen, but
in the time taking folks somewhere. For the person requesting the port,
there is a material loss of cash if the person ports out. They have a
material loss of cashola out of pocket. Something they physically had
already, as opposed to something they might get.
If someone "agreed" to the port price, and then stiffs you, I would
immediately /guildstatus them and report it if they are guilded (easy since
you're just about guaranteed to be in zone with them). Unless you double
check each and ever port person ahead of time, this is much harder to do
with folks that gate out on you.

Basically, you're running a business, and you have the right to require
payment up front. Have a nice day, I'm not buying.

As to the notion of "how much" that someone asked - my "donation" varies.
It's usually 10-20pp (depending on what I have on me) for someone that was
offering. For someone responding to my /ooc, it will range from 10-50pp
depending on how much I have, what I perceive them as been doing beforehand
(more if I think they are going even more out of their way than usual), and
where I'm going (more for dangerous places such as WL/CS/IC than for simple
places like WC/SRo/BB/SFG).

BTW: Think of poor Rezzers. They usually burn in excess of 20% of their mana
pool on a rez, and the situation pretty much DEMANDS that they accept a
donation after the fact.
