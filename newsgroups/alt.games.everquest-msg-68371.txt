Thanks for the comments all - sorry about the dup'ed messages (not related
to EQ problem!)

After going really fast for a while my keyboard locked up!  It was strange
because the mouse was moving fine and the game was playing around me (I was
in a group and could see all the /g messages scrolling by in the message
window). So everything was working except the keyboard...trying to
unplug/reconnect my keyboard (PS/2) did not solve the problem - so I had to
hard reboot.

After I logged back on, everything seemed to be normal speed again...

So I guess the solution to this is to camp, reboot, and login again...

The keyboard lockup concerns me in that I had a similar lock-up a few days
ago with the right mouse button...so this leads me to beleive there is some
bug with whatever code is used for the input devices....
