Get sow'd, get invis'd and then get a port to Skyfire.

A prerequisite is to get a map of Skyfire handy.  It's no more dangerous
than the DL port, and actually less so, because fewer things see thru invis
(in fact, I only know of one thing that does, and chances are he's amiable
to you anyway).  By far this is the fastest, shortest, easiest and safest
way to get there.
