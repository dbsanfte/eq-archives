Like the guy said at the end of that thread, it had nothing to do with DAoC,
and everything to do with Brad McQuaid leaving.  

I really think it was the Trivial Loot Code that finally forced the issue. 
Remember, that was supposed to be in effect on all of Luclin, and it was
when that changed that Brad left.  And once he was gone, they realized that
they could do all these other things, too.
