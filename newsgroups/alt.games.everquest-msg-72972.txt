I must say that I thought you laid out an extremely well thought out
response to the initial posters outrageous whining.  It's obvious that you
were so incensed by his (the original poster previously mentioned) comments,
that you did fail to make use of any capitalization, spell-checking or
proper grammar.  The initial sentence, "you are a retard", served very well
in driving home your points and at the same time putting (the
aforementioned) original poster in his place (we don't want retards thinking
that they have anything worthwhile to say, do we?).  I must admit I am in
awe of what I have read and must congratulate the (is it Palo Alto?) school
system that you attended for the quality of education that they so obviously
provided.

Oh, and one more thought, (I'll give you a second to wipe the drool off the
keyboard....), could you provide the name of the server you are on so I can
avoid it?
