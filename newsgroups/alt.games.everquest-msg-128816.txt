I play a 60 wizard on Brell.  I have Spell Casting Fury maxxed,
natural int over 255 (Yeah I know it's a waste but that's just how my
gear happens to fall).

What I have found with crits is that they are totally random.  I can
be in NToV and killing named and get 3 crits in a row with sunstrike,
and then turn around and go to someplace like Akheva Ruins and crit in
1 every 10-15.  

Unfortunatly with spell resists or doing partial damage is that it's
hard to tell if the crit you are doing is one based on the AA skill or
the one that all wizards get.  

I know this doesn't help much, but it's what I have noticed in my day
to day casting.
