If it is repeatedly like it Id consider saying something. Ive had a
few occasions where I know its just downright rudeness which means
they kept and knowing their bankbalances way exceed mine (for various
reasons such as them boasting earlier) I find it insulting that
someone who has maybe 2k in the bank doesnt get their share of the
loot when someone with 100k is keeping the lot.. perhaps thats why
they have 100k and I dont.

Personally Id just make a simple comment next time I grouped up with
them of "Hey, sorry I had to go so early last time, was the split any
good?" if nothing happens and they do it again.. would advise not
grouping unless you expect no share.
