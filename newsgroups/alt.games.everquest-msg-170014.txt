}If my keys to TOFS are in the bank I can use them anyway?  If I die are they on
}my corpse?  My partner and I always kept 2 sets of TOFS keys, one on us, one in
}the bank.   That way if we died we'd have a spare set of keys.  You are saying
}this isn't necessary?
}Can I destroy the "physical" key once it's on my keyring?

I ran the following test:  I took two characters to ToFS, grouped, one 
with and one without ToFS keys, and clicked the key on the first floor 
mirror (it had already been added to my keychain).  We both went to the 
second floor.  I zoned back out, came back in, and clicked on the mirror 
without the key.  We both went to the second floor.  I zoned back out, 
came back in, destroyed the first floor key and clicked on the mirror.  
We both went to the second floor.  I repeated this cycle until I was on 
floor 4, it all worked fine.  Then I used Tserrinna's straight to the top 
key, and that worked too.  So I deleted all my ToFS keys.  Yay!  I have an 
empty backpack again!

Of course, it will now turn out to work with every key except the 5th 
floor... :)
