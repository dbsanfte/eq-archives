Dear lord, you have to be one of the most arrogant, self-important,
concieted pieces of shit to plague this newsgroup. I have yet to see you
say anything that wasn't pure drivel, and your ideas that you are
somehow 'smart', or that you being 'smart' somehow makes you better than
anyone else, especially new players, are laughable.

Go somewhere else, asshat.
