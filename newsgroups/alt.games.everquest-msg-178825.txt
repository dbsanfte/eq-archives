Anybody wanna buy a whole lot of dyes and dye components?  Cheap?

The only way dyes for FP will be useful any more is if the "magical
component" is a player-made item and requires the current dyes and/or
components.

Meantime, the market for dyed FP {which has been nearly moribund for quite a
while} just got a bullet put into it.  Further, as these are locked to the
slot, then everything you wear gets the one permanent treatment.  No more
swapping colours in and out.
