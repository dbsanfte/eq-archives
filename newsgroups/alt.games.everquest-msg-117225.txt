No "fodder" newbie mobs have factions to worry about.
None of those creatures even have factions, the kobolds do
but it is only with them and they are already kos so it doesn't
matter.

The only thing to watch out for with factions is humanoid types
which are initally not kos. That includes Elf, human, dervish and
other types. Bandit camps are okay, since bandit factions are only
with themselves. You don't lose elf factions killing bandits, in fact
you might gain them if elf bandits. The same is true of dwarf bandits.

Devishes, around the freeport areas, are only a concern if you want to
use a vendor like Murrisa Sandwicher in nro. She is a nice vendor
there for evil races since she is indiff to them by default (as are
the dervishes, except the thug) Outside of her and I think one vendor
in the first hut in East commons (after leaving west freep) there are
no other mobs on dervish faction except dervishes.

No drake, pixie or fairie types really have to be worried about in the
gfay areas. They are their own factions and only lower themselves. 

You don't really have any faction worries for mobs as a gnome (which I
assume you are, or some newbie race from around there) until in
velious and high enough level to kill giants or dwarves. Most people
new to the land slay giants since the giants already hate them while
the dwarves don't and have good shopping.
