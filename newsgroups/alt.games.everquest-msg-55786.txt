Personally, my preferred is a Monk... I've been partnerring with a monk the
past few levels (I'm 30th now), and it works great... SoW, Skin, and Thorn
the monk...  Sit back and just snare and heal...  If things go bad, he can
FD, and I can gate...  :)  Not to mention, he's GREAT at single-pulls...  If
he multi-pulls, he pulls away from me, FD's, then waits...  When all but one
leaves, he stands up, and pulls it toward me.. :)
