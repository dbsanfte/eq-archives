So I suppose that if you ask for a steak dinner medium rare, and they bring
you one well done that it's just as good?

Some people (like me) can't find their way around Butcherblock, I personally
HATE the zone, every time I have to go to Kedge, I port myself to Steamfont
and run, since I can find the way from Gfay to Dagnors in Butcherblock.

Butcherblock is the ONLY zone in the game that I have any problems getting
lost in besides the canyon area of Everfrost (and who hasn't gotten lost
there?)

I never respond to people who shout for a port to Gfay, because I know that
I can't port them there and if I take them to Steamfont or Butcherblock,
they'll end up wanting an escort or something, which I don't feel like
wasting the time to do.
