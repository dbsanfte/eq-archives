sounds to me like you got a AGP card for a PCI video port.  happened to me
when I was buying a video card, had to return the AGP card and get a PCI
video card.  Probably should of looked before I even got the card, but
didn't even know enough about it.  Got it at a place I could return it also.
Before you go cutting up that card doing anything to it, might wanna look
into this a bit more, maybe take your comp down to some upgrade place to see
what you really need.  Probably returning those cards if possible would be
your best solution once you get the PCI card.
