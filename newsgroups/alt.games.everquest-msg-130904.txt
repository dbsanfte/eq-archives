I've never spent any time in BW at all (except the odd Clerical Epic mob
or picking up quest items.)  How would a 50 wizard fare there? Or is it
something that's more attuned to necro tactics?  I'm looking for a place
to grind out level 50 so I can get my next AoE and get back to quadding
full time. I can stay in Tim Deep and keep doing chickens, but it's sort
of old and I could use a change of scenery.
