You should be able to quad Othmir Warriors in CS, you say the zone is too
busy, but at least on my server all that traffic is busy keeping the Wyverns
away from me.  Not sure though if you can single pull them though, if
nothing else bribe one of the druids in zone to harmony the camp for you.
(or for that matter, duo up to quad them, faster kills that way)

You should also be able to quad skellies in The Grey, but you need an EB
item for this (and never zone in without invis up, the trains are killer)
