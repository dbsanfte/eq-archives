Hang on to that guy.
While I didn't like having to quit contacts 12 years ago, I was
grateful my optometrist told me why I had to (I was getting blood
vessels in my corneas and had some scarring on my right eye)

Well, you want the glass centered where you're going to see it, unless
you want prismatic effects.

My optometrist actually didn't warn me about retina detachment. The
first time anyone said explicitly that I was at risk was when I was
examined by a 3rd year student last year, they took pictures of my
retinas with lovely little myopic crescents where the retinas pull
away from the nerve, and the supervisor told me I should be aware of
that. It made me very glad I'd only trained karate for 6 weeks :)

How is your field of vision on the blurry side of that eye, by the
way?
