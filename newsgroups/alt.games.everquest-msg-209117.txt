Well, actually, I think that many would argue that STR is the wrong place 
to put the starting points too.  STR is easy to raise with gear, STA is 
harder to raise.  More HP is always good.  I put most of my starting 
points on my wood elf ranger into STA, if not all of them.  Gearwise, I 
would definitely concentrate more on AC/HP/STA than on AGI.  STR will not 
be much of an issue, so many things have STR on them.  DEX can be handy 
in large increments, as it does increase your chances of critting and 
increase the rate at which you learn melee skills.  DEX also increases 
your skillup rate for fletching, if it is higher than your WIS and INT.
