yeah bastards always do that for us too.
fat ogres n trolls make a blockage at the end too, for "a joke"..

I don't mind getting past on my monk, but when its my cleric or shaman (with
the time delay in zoning twice, rescribing spells, and the 90% probability
of crashing upon zone to GD, and being locked for 10 mins).. last time I
gave them 10 seconds to move or i was gating.  they moved :)

theres always laugh and cheer when somebody falls, but it does slow you down

Had somebody in duel mode get fluxed by a wizard when he was crossing the
bridge one time lol
