This is exactly what I believe is happening, but most bards I talk to on 
Combine are adamant in their insistence that the hastes themselves are 
stacking.

Its my theory that although there may be some benefit to be squeezed out 
of the side effects, that it is very likely that there is some  other 
song which would be more beneficial to the group, since bards are 
limited to 4 or 5 songs (or in some less skilled cases, 3), that they 
could be running something more useful in that slot... even if that song 
is their self haste, which also won't stack haste % but which might be 
=better= haste than the cast one.
