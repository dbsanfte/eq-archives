My hubby, a 20 Druid, was hunting in North Karana.  He found a Very Tiny
Skeleton on his tracking.  It coned blue to him and was about the size of
his foot it was so small.

When he got close to it the skelly attacked him and then two more jumped out
of it.  He managed to kill them all and looted something called Very Tiny
Crumpled Skeleton.  It was a No Drop item.  Does anyone know what it's for?
I checked the web sites but haven't found anything on it.

Thank you
