Yes:

step 1:

www.lavasoftusa.com

Adware

Download and install it and have it do search and reg search on your
system, it finds all adware and removes it. Such popular programs as
bearshare are adware programs that might put popup crap on your
computer (spyware or adware) This program has a growing list constanly
updated of such programs and companies.

Step 2:

www.panicware.com

popupstopper

Excellent program which is freeware like adaware. Totally stops popups
from popping up. very nice program because you CAN have another page
or something pop up in your browser still by holding down the ctrl key
(default) while you click on the link.

Step 3:

If in 98, go to programs in the START menu, then accessories, then
system tools, system information, then look in it under tools, system
configuration utility. Look under startup and make sure ONLY the
programs you want to be in there are in there.

On mine i've disabled several things among them a real player start
thing which it insists on  running in the startup after I run it once
then I promptly disable it again.
