I generally have 3 assist-related keys per bank of hotkeys:
1) simply /assist.  Useful for seeing who/what is targeted/has aggro.
2) puller assist.  Find out who the puller in the group is, make a hotkey 
that does "/assist pullername".  Useful for when your role includes doing 
something to the mob on its way in (especially useful when I'm playing my 
enchanter and need to mez, or when I need to snare with my ranger/druid).
3) MT assist.  Find out who the MT is in the group and make a hotkey that 
does "/assist mtname".

Also, turn off the "attack on assist" option.  Sometimes you just want to 
target something without attacking it.  Since you're not used to 
assisting anyway, this shouldn't trip you up too badly.

In a raid situation (I may be reaching here, but useful anyway), you'll 
probably have a chain of MTs lined up in case the first, second, etc. 
dies.  In this case I usually set up one bank of hotkeys that's pretty 
identical to the others, but with the MT hotkey set up for the next MT in 
line.  Also, if you can taunt (there are many forms of taunt, I won't go 
into them here) you should have one bank set up with a taunt key in place 
of the assist MT key.  This is for when things really get desperate and 
you're the one tanking :P
