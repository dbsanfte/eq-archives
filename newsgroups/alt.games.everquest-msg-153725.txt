Exciting role they're making for us.

Currently, mages summon up large stacks of rods Pre-battle, using
available healing resources to regen the mana used.  During the
fight, they self rod to support their nukes - that's how they dish
out excellent damage.

Now, as you pointed out, they have to summon during the fight.  In
addition to this, they can no longer self rod for net mana gain - so
they must sit on their butts and not use up mana for anything BUT
T-rod.  A mage's nuking DPS is going to drop through the floor now.
Not only that, but the only way to keep up with supplying rods to 5
clerics is going to be pet cannibalization - meaning we won't have
a pet up.  This change has the exact opposite effect of the one they
were after.

A way to make the change they're after would be to make T-rod
cost 500ish mana, targetable summon a Lore/No-drop rod with unlimited
charges of a spell that took 400hp and returned 100mana, with
the 1 minute timer on it.  That way, extra healing can get
any caster as much as FT10, but no more, whereas a caster using
it in a solo situation, or one without extra healing, will be
limited by their hp regen (for a soloing 58 mage, that's 11 hp
per tick, or < 3 mana per tick - still a downgrade from self modding)

Parses on the Magicians tower have self rodding with healing support
adding from 10 to 40 DPS over not rodding.  If the pet upgrades
were meant to balance this, why did the other 2 main pet classes
also get them without their most powerful spell being nerfed?  We
need to replace that DPS to be in the top tier of damage dealers
again.  

Another way to replace the lost DPS is to allow Rage of Zomm to 
be useable with a pet up, combined with the same changes made 
to UHoF and Sword of Xuzl (immune to ae, 250 mana)  This would
add back 15-20dps back to our class.
