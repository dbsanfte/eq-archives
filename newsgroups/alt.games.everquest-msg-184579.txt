Finding a trader is pretty easy. When you find an item you like just 
right-click the trader's name in the Bazaar window. You'll be turned to 
face where ever they are, so if you keep that window open and keep doing 
that as you run through the Bazaar you'll find the person without much 
hassle (sometimes you gotta go around things :P ).

Also you can do a Bazaar search for just a particular trader in that 
drop-down box, then follow the same method as above.

As for the items being sold, were they indeed sold or could you not see 
them? I recently came back to EQ after some six months and was dismayed 
to find that I could still only see the first 30 items a trader was 
selling. When Bazaar first came out you could throw up to 80 items in 
bags in your inventory and put them up for sale, but buyers could see 
only the first 30. You'd see a great item for a cheap price in a Bazaar 
search only to find it was somewhere past the 30 item limit and out of 
your reach save for buying all their items until it showed up. Anyhow, I 
came back and it was still like this even though people said it was 
fixed. Turns out I was using my custom skin so the merchant window XML 
file hadn't been updated. I threw the new one in my skin folder and all 
is well :)

The bags to sell items are sold in the middle plaza with the many 
merchants. Enter from the front (the wall side) and the first merchant 
on the right sells them. You'll notice he's the only merchant on his own 
behind a counter. Just put items in those bags, stand in a stall, and 
enter /trader mode.
