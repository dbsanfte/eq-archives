And what i said before.. if you want to break down to it.. i could
tank anything sans rares in Earth unslowed. And really.. rares too if
the cleric has a good mana pool, FT, and fous items. If we had great
dps group.. say replacing the slower for a wizard or rogue and having
other heavy hitters there.. i could do it indefinately. Slows are a
choice, especially one when your members are lacking in gear.. and one
you usually don't bypass, but not a necessity.. and if you drop the
slow you pick up dps to compensate.

Most mobs in the game can be done unslowed.. its just a matter of
balancing with dps, a great tank, and/or healing depth. But who wants
to if slow is available? Its easier to just employ a slower to cut
down the incoming dps and kill that way, it just isn't the only way.
