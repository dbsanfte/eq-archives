Well, the easy way would be to ask someone on your old server, or someone in
the serverwide.age:age channel who doesn't have a FV character yet to make
one and run the 6 minutes or so worth of leg work to do the hand in for
you.  How you could reward them, other than your thanks, is an open
question, if they have no intention of making a FV character for real.  But
since you have an account on Drinal, you could pay (in cash, goods, or
favors) people with Drinal characters to help you out on FV.

I'm looking at much the same problem for a shaman friend of mine, if she
wants to do the iksar cudgel series of quests she needs someone to make a
dummy Iksar shaman to MQ the start for her.  Thus far she's not really
interested enough to worry about it, it also takes a high level enchanter
coming to Cabalis to turn her into a lizard or a potion to do so that runs
about 400pp, and we don't have anywhere near that kind of cash to throw
around just yet in FV money.

Anyone think of any other quests that require a dummy character to start for
most races of a given class?  FV's one character per account limit makes
those kind of crippling.
