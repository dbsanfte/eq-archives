Dunno. Will check that out tonight. The one we were interested in was
the line of necro spells that turn the necro into a Skelly while
leaching health away from the mobs. Tarre didn't used to care, since she
hated the look of her old robe, but since she go the purple Thurg clicky
robe, it's been annoying her no end. Hope it's fixed.

And we were only just getting to where we could try them.
