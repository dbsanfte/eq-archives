Yes I most certainly can read. That's how I know that

"So, we decided to list the Top Ten themes we would address
 starting Monday" (what they said)

means something different to

"So, we decided to list the Top Ten themes as we see them,
and we will address them starting Monday" (what you heard)

The text of that list was worked out in 30 minutes based
on what had been talked about in the morning session (which
was mainly raid related stuff for high end guilds because 90%
of the people there were in that group). It was meant to say
"these are some things that we can go away and work on right now".

Quote: "What I'm trying to say is...These guys deserve a chance.
They love this game and they're tired of where it's been headed.
Read over these and keep an open mind that this is obviously
not "a CD, 2 books, 20 printed pages, and a manifesto."

Anyway enough of that, heres what you guys are really after...

This list is from a letter given to us today after the EQ team met
to discuss what they'd heard in our individual meetings. Keep
in mind this isn't a final list or even close to it. They got a ton of
information today, and this is more of a "to do" list for the time
being while they finish going through it all."

They're not prioritising the DX9 bugs? They have virtually all
of their team that can be working on it, to try and get it finished
as soon as possible.

I have also read around on places like steelwarrior, gucomics,
http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=8094&page=1&pp=15
to see what people who were at the summit had to say. Perhaps
the problem is you need to be better read.
