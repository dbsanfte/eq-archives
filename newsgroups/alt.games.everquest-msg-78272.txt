Rangers get SoW and Snare too.  heh the biggest problem with SoC, as soon as
you hit something or cast a spell, you lose SoC. Before they nerfed it to
group only, you could SoC a kiting druid.. and watch them panic when they
cast a dot/nuke and lost SoC lol.

When leveling my SK (me controlling SK and cleric) I found cheal was more
beneficial somewhere around 35-40. (I was going for optimal healing..
chealing with very very few hp left heh)   Once Divine Light isn't enough to
heal you (I guess once you pass 1.7khp or so) Cheal becomes very mana
effective (before then Divine light and remedy are like a fast cast cheal
anyway)

Depends on the zone (and level range)
Me 60 monk and a friend 60 rogue dealt with 5 small mushrooms in 1 pull
earlier today, in Fungus Grove.  (No im not a shitty puller heh.. damn 65
people in the zone, so we just sat on the spawn spot to fight)

I've also dealt with 4 mobs when Ive been playing my monk and cleric on the
other computer (lvl 57) in Velk, on Saturday though 4 mobs killed my cleric,
whilst i was grouped with a 58 cleric (not me controlling that one).

Well as a 60 monk, I'd take a rogue over a warrior any day in a duo.  The
damage output is so much higher that I don't take that much damage before
the mob is dead (less damage then a warrior would take exping with me)

BTW 70% bind wound is level 51+, but once you gain AA levels, you can bind
to 100% with 3 points in it.  I havent carried bandages since level 54 or
so, but I can bind to 100% (its a pre-requisite of critical mend heh)

Also monks mend will take that 70% hp to almost full hp.
