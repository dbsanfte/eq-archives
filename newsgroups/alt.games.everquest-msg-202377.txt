Tiamat had 5 heads not 3. And Depending on who you talk to is
un-killable (a great many ppl on Wizards.com msg boards beleive gods
in D&D should be unkillable (because in 2e D&D they weren't statted
like they were/are in 1e/3e) because shes a god (some treat her as
such) but the do give non-god Tiamat stats in the 3e MotP.

As for My best D&D memory? well it would be the one time i actually
got to be a player (as opposed to a Dungeon Master), which was a big
deciding factor as to why i got into EQ.
