Why is it your buisness how other people want to play?

: The below statement

In real life, the way the balance of nature works is the predators cull
the herds by killing the sick and the weak, predators make the herds
stronger, there are natural fluctuations in this cycle, but basically
balance between animal and plant populations is maintained.

The situation you describe is unbalanced. If there were druids/rangers 
in the real world, what kind of people would they be?

In this regard EQ bears no resemblance to the real worls. There are no
herds, only predators, and they are all somewhat insane, which is OK,
they just die and respawn, just like us.

: You won't kill the amiable bears but you have no problem buying the pelts
: from others that do kill your bear friends?? Where is the logic there??
: Your hands are still dirty from the kill, so your sword didn't bring it down

The simple fact that the druid is a -leather- only class is significant.
One cannot be too principled  or the character becomes crippled, and
that is just not fun. There are no alternatives, bags are leather, if
there were alternatives, I might explore them.

And don't get confused there is no market for anything.

Look, in general none of my characters kill anything amiable, because I
equate amiable with friendly, and friendly with friend, and I don't kill
my friends, it just doesn't feel right to me.  :-)

Yes I check inns and corpses for low/medium hides. I don't make and sell
stuff. I do sit in newbie zone and make patckwork at times. I have
killed bears and wolves.

I find it silly that you can kill hundreds of thousands of animals, make
a pyramid the size of the great pyramid of thier corpses, sit on the top
of that pyramid, and the bears and wolves still want to lick your hand.

I think there should be an animal faction, that is lost from killing
animals, and there should be an equivelant task to regain that animal
faction, like putting forage fruit on an altar at a druid ring.

I think the druid faction should be connected to this animal faction,
you kill enough animals and the other druids start to get pissed at,
(ahhh bud, you may be a druid, but you are screwing with the balance of
nature).

I am not an EQ animal rights advocate, please do not confuse me with
one.
