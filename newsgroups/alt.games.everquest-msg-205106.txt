Well I found a copy of spirit quickening for 300 pp, which might be
throwing away money but I went ahead and bought it to play with.

My first run doing this logging effort didn't turn out too well,
looking over it I clearly am not seeing the pet damage output very
well in the early sections, probably because I'm at a distance and
missing most of the pet hit messages, even though I see all the mob
hit messages.

I had the pet kill several frost giant scouts, unbuffed, with
alacrity, with alacrity and spirit quickening, and with HOS on as
well.  There was a very marked difference between alacrity and not,
the other buffs didn't have such a noticable effect.  I was hoping
that the logs would give me the ability to actually measure the
different effects but since I didn't capture all the hits and misses
this doesn't seem so useful.

I did a few other experiments, and discovered that spirit quickening
takes the same buff slot as Burst of Strength; I couldn't cast Burst
on while SQ was running.  Burst, cast on me, does stack with Str
buffs and with HOS, insofar as actually adding more Str, so I imagine
SQ does the same, although its sure going to be harder to prove one
way or the other.

In what little I could glean from the logs, apparantly pet normally
hits once every 3 seconds, and once every 2 seconds with alacrity; it
still looks like 2 seconds with SQ on, but I'm not sure you can see
another 20% haste all that easily, I guess it should be 2 seconds, 1
second, 2 seconds, 1 second, since the log system is too grainy to
show the 1.4 second (is that even right?) rate we should really get
out of a 60% net haste.   What I really need is how many rounds per
minute or something, so I can see the tinier differences, I guess
I'll try again while tanking the mobs myself so I'm not so far away.

start  start start start
1.4    1      2       1
2.8    2      3       3
4.2    4      5       4
5.6    5      6       6
7.0    7      7       7

would be theoretical ways to display that 1.4 second delay: rounding
always down or always up or to nearest.  Either way, you'd see some
apparant 1 second delays.
