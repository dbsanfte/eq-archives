Probably depends on what level you are and where you want to hunt.

If you're mid-high 20s, and wanting to hunt Iceclad, you're probably
better off binding to Freeport and hitching the raft back and forth.
If you want to hunt the Eastern Wastes/wakening Lands area, bind to
Kael.  The bind points at either end of the city are safe, and you can
walk past the front guards in Eastern Wastes without them noticing
you.  If you want to hunt the Great Divide area, and you've done
nothing to piss off the dwarves, by all means bind to Thurgadin.
