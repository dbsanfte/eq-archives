>>>Had to do that a few times (the first three times were unsuccessful CR's)
when I was bound in Felwithe and decided to go to Qeynos.<<<

At least Luclin made this part a little easier ...
Felwithe --> GFay --> Nexus --> Toxx --> Erudin --> short boat ride -->
Qeynos

>>>As far as the caster who think it's only right that pure casters are the
only ones who get to bind, I disagree.<<<

I really don't have an opinion on this matter. I will bind anyone who asks
me, for free. Sometimes if I'm going through a city zone, I'll give a quick
shout asking if anyone wants to be bound. I've never been bothered for one,
and it's never bothered me to do one.

What bothers me is when they ask to be buffed afterwards, and I try to
explain that, even though I am level 27, I only have one buff I can give you
that's useful. And one that's useful depending on where you are going at the
moment.
