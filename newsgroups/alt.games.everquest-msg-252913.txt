Hey folks -

I recently got interested in getting a couple of illusion masks for the heck
of it.  I've got some information together for anyone else that wants to do
get illusion masks for their bard or rogue main/alt.

Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask (Illusion: Barbarian)
Raid Encounter
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7995

Mask of Deception (Illusion: Dark Elf)
Easiest to get.  Can be done solo at 50+ most likely.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1875

Mask of Obtenebration (Illusion: Erudite)
A well-balanced 50+ (55+?) in Charisis (aka Howling Stones).

Besmirched Mask of Conception (Illusion: Dwarf)
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16158

Mask of Tinkering (Illusion: Gnome)
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4811

Burnoose of the Halfbreed (Illusion: Half Elf)
Kill a poacher.  Helps your faction in JPF, I'd guess.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13902

Dessicated Halfling Mask (Illusion: Halfling)
Dropped in Chardok.  And yes, even enchanters can wear this one.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6896

Guise of the Coercer (Illusion: High Elf)
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5817

This one requires a rogue, because it basically involves doing the rogue
epic.  At the very least, a rogue is required to pickpocket two pieces from
two rogue trainers (one in Neriak, one in Kaladim).  While killing the rogue
trainers may be possible, they will not drop the items that need to be
pickpocketed.  The items are tradeable.

It's a pretty simple epic, with one two-group fight against Renux Herkanor
and a raid in Kithicor Forest.  I've killed Renux with a 65 pally tanking, a
65 rogue, and myself on 56.

However, you do have to kill Stanos Herkanor to loot his head.  This also
requires a full raid.

Circlet of Disguise (Illusion: Human)
Raid event that requires killing a big melted jellybean.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15984

Iksar Hide Mask (Illusion: Iksar)
Beat up a level 50 Iksar wizzy ghost.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1876

Guise of the Hunter (Illusion: Vah Shir)
Taken off of a level 55 assasin in Ssraeshza Temple.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7528

Crown of Deceipt (Illusion: Wood Elf)
Quested item.  Anyone can do this one.  It's pretty amusing seeing wood elf
beastlords and monks running around Norrath. :)
