Hello,

Several years ago I used to play everquest. With the release of a
graphic upgrade and the trilogy, I'm thinking I'd like to play again
casually.

Does anyone have an active guild for casual gamers that groups
regularly? I would probably play about 3 hours a week on friday night.
I would therefore level very slowly.

Thanks,
LF

PS please reply to levi_franklin@hotmail.com
