Very generous person indeed, my hat's off to him. On the other hand, I
started a Froglok Wizard on Tunare the other day, my only char there,
and at level 4, I have only been able to upgrade his starting dagger to
a giant snake fang. That's it, he's wearing absolutely nothing else and
having a blast!!!!! I have managed to collect quite a few of the items
needed for the newbie armor quest, but have yet to complete a single
piece. I have managed to sell enough to equip him with 6 backpacks and a
sewing kit. It is so much fun simply running around, that I think I may
create a few more chars in various zones. Weekend is coming, and am
getting set for some real entertainment!!
