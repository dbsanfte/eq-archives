I'm not so sure about that...who would buy a level 20 character?  The true
newbie who wants to experience the game is going to want to start at level
1.  The true newbie who just wants to be really powerful is going to go to
ebay and get something in the 50s, at least--level 20 is way too low for
that kind of person.

I think there is a good chance that most people who would buy a 20 are
people who have already played well past 20 with one or more characters, and
simply do not want to do the lowest newbie zones yet again.
