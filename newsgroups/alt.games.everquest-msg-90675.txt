First things first, get a sow at the bank or wherever you are its NEVER
taken me longer than 20 mins to get one  (and I play off peak) . 2nd, dont
run into mobs, this is quite easy really, unless they pop on top of you.
With sow you should be fine, especially at lvl 50!

What are you doing in this type of room w/o a chanter/bard, sorry but you
are just asking for it. Unless of course you had one and he's shit, well
that's just tough tits. 5 mobs should be no trouble at all for a competent
chanter. Shit I lived through a 10plus train pull by chain stunning the
other day in SolB or was it Lguk, i forget which.

So no cleric in group either. Jeez mate you are really asking for trouble.

50plat! Thats pretty damn good, I;ve been in spots where the tight arsed
clerics have asked for over 100! And fer crisake you can make that back in 1
or 2 kills in RM or FM, 5 minutes tops!

Shit group, I would never regroup with any of those ppl again.

Ok, heres a little trick which will extend your time, go to the merchants in
RM and sell your crap, then buy stuff, then resell. you will get a return of
about 7gp from 9gp for your shrapnel. And imo it's a good thing that there
is no close bank, shit you could make a bleedin fortune... sorry it would be
just too easy.

 Before sol it was even worse. See how you like running to Lake Rathe,

See my trick above.

Oh and being part of a good guild can help enormously with tricky CR.

cheers
