===
legal

adj 1: established by or founded upon law or official or accepted
rules
===

Why not? Legal doesn't always refer to "government law":

===
law    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (lï¿½)
n. 
A rule of conduct or procedure established by custom, agreement, or
authority. 
===

Also note that, as shown above, "law" refers to established rules as
well. Certainly an "illegal play" in football isn't violating any
government laws.
