Hey, I'm no where near close to this content.  (Was considering GoD
for the fishing, now that it's nerfed I think I'll pass.)

As for the mobs, the ones listed were all 65 plus.  I liked the one
that spawns everytime someone dies in the zone =)

So I doubt they hit for less.  I'm interested to see the tactics in
working through it. (Pray?)

Also, one of the devs said in a GoD pre-release quote that "Tacvi
would make time guilds look like they were in ToV in patchwork armor"
(paraphrasing, but you get the idea).  Guess this is one way to do it.
