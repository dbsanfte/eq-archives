When I made my first character, with help from my son, before we knew
anything, I made a dwarf cleric. Put 25 pts into strength and 5 into
wis (int?). And proceeded to primarily solo to lvl 29. Root, nuke,
melee, heal myself. Repeat. Things got alot easier when i upgraded my
1hb to blackjack. I can still take a blue con.  (so much for class
balance)

So whats the big deal about clerics soloing? lol
