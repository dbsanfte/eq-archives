Reality - what you are doing is wrong and I think if your friends Lurchster and
Gail knew about it, they would be very disappointed in you.  

I think if Anomsuth sees what you have done, he would be totally in his rights
to contact Sony and request you be suspended permanently from EQ.  

At this point - I would say that in order for Lurchster and Gail to not disown
you as a friend (which is a real possiblity here) you need to print a
retraction to this post and apologize here in this thread to Anomsuth. 

This was beneath even you and I am very disappointed that you still have not
learned anything.  Jim is probably looking down and crying.  

I mean it Rob - when i get back to this newsgroup this afternoon, I expect to
see your retraction to this and an apology or you will have a lot more to worry
about this looking like an ass.

Do you remember how i told you a few weeks ago that if do the right thing all
the time then you never have to worry about getting caught when you screw up?  

There is no excuse for what you did here!!
