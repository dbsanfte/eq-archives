Nah, it sounds like a *feature.*  ;)

Atone (and the memory blur enchanter line of spells) are great
at managing agro.  That's why they're there.   If, for instance, I
pull a non-KOS mob, find out I can't kill it even though I did get
its health below half, I can use Atone and get out of the situation.
Atone it and the mob simply wanders off.   Why shouldn't someone
else be able to pull it when it's health is below 1/2 and still get
the experience?

Knowingly using Atone to kill steal is bannable, of course, just like
using Ice Comet to do the same is.   That doesn't mean they're
both bugged because they can be used the same way.
