Nope. Petition stays in queue for 12 hours, whether you're online or
off, or until it's resolved or deleted by a GM/guide as unavailable.
Usually the unav. deletes occur after 3 views and the player who sent
was either offline or unresponsive, but the issue is still looked at
if it's one that doesn't require anything from the player more than
what's in the petition...
