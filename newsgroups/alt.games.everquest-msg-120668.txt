The higher one outrules the lower according to lvl restrictions ie. if you
are wearing a polished bone bracelet AND a chipped bone bracelet and cast a
lvl 20 or below spell the polished will take effect but if you cast a
20+spell the chipped one will trigger instead.
If you are wearing items with different effects and cast a spell affected by
several effects they will all trigger.
Example casting a DOT wearing both Koblold hide boots and a Medicine totem
the spell will have lowered manacost and longer duration.
