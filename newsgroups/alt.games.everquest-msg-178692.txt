I heard that some young man killed himself in real time on the internet, is
that a plague? Young men killing themselves in droves because they really
don't have anything to live for? If I have anything to do with it, I'll see
if I can keep him out of Hell, as he doesn't belong there, he does, but he
doesn't because he died in a manner befitting a martyr publicizing both the
fact that guys really don't have anything to live for (i.e. women), and he
killed himself with psychotropic medications bringing light onto that issue.

I'm generally happy with the way things are going, so I guess I will lay off
the plaguing for today, although the poor lobsters languishing alone in
their tanks still needs to be avenged. Seems like every bad thing that could
possibly happen within normal standards has happened, The space shuttle
exploding over the president's home state was classic I thought. I don't
know what else could occur, guess we will wait for tommorrow's headlines. I
noticed that the moon was a little sliver tonight in the cloudless and dry
California sky.
