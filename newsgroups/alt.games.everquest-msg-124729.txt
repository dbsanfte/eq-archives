I sure hope they do something about the pathing eventually. Pathing and Targeting
remain my only 2 major complaints about EQ left.

Can't wait for the Bazaar changes either. Really exciting things coming up for EQ.

But seriously. What could a hacker do with alt-tab that they can't already do? Just give
us the damn Alt-tab, fuck the play in a window thing, I just want to browse the
