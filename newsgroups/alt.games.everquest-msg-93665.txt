Obviously only a guess, but I'd go with number 3. The pet seems to
share/mimic so many attributes of the master that I'd not be at all
suprprised if it were treated in this forumula as being the same level
as the master. So, the pet would get 30/(30 + 30 + 30) of the xp.  The
bonus, of course, would only apply to the number of actual "players" in
the group, as the max bonus has been stated as being for a group of six. 

However, your question raises another very valid one.  Consider the
following group of six players. (And by the way, I bet this group would
KICK ASS. he he)
All level 30:
Mage - Mage - Mage - Necro - Necro - Necro.
All using pets.

Ok, so one of the Jobabers gets a really hot set of dice on a given kill
and does more damage than any of the Necro's or Mages do with their
spells. What happens, if we consider the possiblity that the underlying
formulas treat the pets as players?

Does the pet who makes the kill get xp of 30/(30 * 12) of the mob's xp
!!!???!!! Meaning that the Players all get that???  Or, is the pet the
only one of the NPCs there getting a full share so Jobaber gets 30/(30 *
7) of [95% of the mob's XP plus 20% bonus]. (Reason being that all of
the other five pets should apparently scoop up 1% each of the xp right
off the top.) And if not, what's the group bonus for a group of 12? VI
has only listed bonuses up to six. So I think we can assume the bonus is
only 20%. But now that 20% of bonus pie is being divided up among how
many? Six? Seven? Twelve?
