I played EQ for 2 years and lost a 10kp item to a vendor in a quest gone
bad. Do you think VI helped at all? F no. I canceled my account. My purpose
for posting then? Quit. I had not realized what a freaking cloud I had been
in for the last 2 years until I had no EQ to log into. Do yourself and the
folks you give a *real* rats arse about a huge favor. Cancel your account. I
have a good friend who sold his business and now lives with an old roomate
and plays EQ all freakin day. What kind of existence is that? I know, I
laughed at first to. But now its this 32 year old man living in front of a
PC hoping to hit level 56. All I ask, is that you all reconsider your
addiction to this game.
God speed and God bless to all. Some of you will perish from this planet
with nothing but EQ to show for a life. On the upside, your name may live in
EQ lore for many game years. On the downside, the devil himself is a gm.
