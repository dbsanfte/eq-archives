I only fired up Test to look at it after someone mentioned this new look 
last week.  The first thing I noticed is a bug on the scroll bar.  Click 
and drag on the scroll bar and watch your mouse in relation to the bar - 
it's wrong.

Might be fixed, now, or it may have been my mouse.  If it is a bug, I am so 
amazed that something like this gets past QC.
