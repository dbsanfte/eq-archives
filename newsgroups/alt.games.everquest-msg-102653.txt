Last night I got a call to help out a friend that I have been raiding quite a
bit with recently.  I play a level 60 warrior, and he was looking to kill the
"real" Venril Sathair, who had just spawned.

The interesting thing is how we did it, with just barely over one group.
Seven people.

Level 60 Warrior
Level 60 Cleric
Level 60 Enchanter
Level 60 Wizard
Level 60 Wizard
Level 60 Wizard
Level ?? Druid. (he was anon and blue to me)

And to be honest with you, we could have done it with four people, myself and
the three wizards.

The fight went like this.   Aegolism on warrior.   Druid harmonies and pulls
the room.  (not really necessary).

The Enchanter then runes the warrior, and casts Aggro increase on him.
(again, not really  necessary)

Warrior engages VS, and uses the Auto-riposte for 10 second discipline.

Wizards number one through three cast Manaburn.

Loot Venril Sathair's corpse.

For those who don't know what Manaburn is, it is one of the final alternate
advancement skills for wizards.  It has a two and a half hour recharge, and
allows the wizard to pour all of his remaining mana into a single super high
damage nuke.   On a normal hit, Manaburn deals out around 7000 damage.
Critical blasts can be upwards of 20000.

Against any Kunark mob, this is completely overpowered...  Against Venril
Sathair, who has about what, 16 or 20 k hp total, you can see the results
above.    5 wizards and a warrior that can tank for 6 seconds could kill
Gorenaire.  Thats assuming that none of them get criticals.

You really have to wonder sometimes, whether Verant thinks about things before
just going ahead and adding them...   but for myself, at the very least I
would expect to see all Kunark level "boss" mobs become immune to Manaburn
pretty soon.

In the meantime, congrats A_guildmember_01 on Blood Ember Greaves....


(as far as I know, this is at least the 4'th time VS has been slain this way
on our server alone.)
