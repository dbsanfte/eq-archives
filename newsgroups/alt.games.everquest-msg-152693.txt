I am with you. But EQ can play fine without camping, I play all the time
and I don't camp 'ANYTHING' since I helped a guildmate camp the AC
once for 9 hours. That is total bullshit, never again. My guild had 2 clerics
do the old rage camp in Skyfire, what a nightmare. Bless the folks that did that
but I wouldn't have.

What kills me is that once in a while I run around and see if any mobs are
up that I need for various quests. Sometimes I get lucky ang get my quest
item but most times I see someone else there and they have a 'list'
for the next people to come to the camp and ask me If I want to sign up.
Fuck that, I don't wait in line in real life at the grocery store I sure as hell
am not waiting in line in a damn game! LOL!

ALL major quest mobs should be spawned/triggered by the player doing the
quest, and No part of any quest should take more than about 2-3 hours to
complete in one sitting. Thankfully most quests are like this, I like the quest
part of this game, its part of the fun for me, but I avoid any 'camp' quests like
a plague.

I don't mind quests that take a lot of time to do, but not all in one sitting.
For instance the Worker's Sledgemallet quest in the Overthere I did recently.
Basically its just a faction quest where I had to kill Sarnarks and turn in warbraids
to raise faction. It was long and time consuming but I could do the quest whenever
I wanted and in 2 hour stints. I didn't have to wait in line or go for some rare mob
pop. I got a nice item, already saved my ass 2 times.
