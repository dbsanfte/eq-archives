Right-click on the item and a window will appear showing the stats of
the item.

All starting cities have "newbie quests" to allow you to earn better
weapons and/or armor.  I've not spent much time in Halas, so I don't
know exactly which NPC you should talk to.  Try hailing and talking to
all the NPCs in the same building as your guildmaster.  If the NPC
responds with some words in [square brackets], try asking him about
those words.

For example, if you hail somone and he says something like this:

  "Hello there!  I'm afraid I don't have much time to talk right
   now because of the growing [orcish threat]."

That's a clue that he wants to talk more about the orcs.  You might
respond with something like this:

  "What orcish threat?"

He might then go on to tell you about the dastardly orcs and
what you can do to help, presumably with some reward for doing
so.

However, many players find that the rewards for these "newbie
quests" simply aren't worth it.  Another option would be to go to
the Bazaar and search for all weapons/armor usable by you, and buy
the best one you can afford.
