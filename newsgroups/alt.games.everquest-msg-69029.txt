I've heard that you need to kill all the undead at the ruins, including the
putrid skel, for Pyzjn to appear, but I was playing my Ranger, who is only
level 4, and accidentally got too close to the ruins while tracking and was
toasted by her and her pet while the other undead were still around, so I
assume that its bunk that they have to be gone for her to pop.

However, I was wondering a few things:

1. What level do you need to be to solo her successfully if you're a caster or
hybrid? I've got a Necro I'd like her to meet. :)

2. If you take out Pyzjn, do you still have to deal with her pet, or does he
disappear like most pets do when their master is gone?

3. If I do take her on with my Necro, should I memorize Scent of Dusk, or does
she not have a high degree of resistances?

If I do eventually take her on with my Necro, I may bring a Paladin along to
take care of her pet and other undead while I deal with her, and maybe someone
who can Slam to interrupt her spellcasting.
