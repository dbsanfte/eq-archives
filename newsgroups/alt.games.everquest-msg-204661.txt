It also can't be dispelled. Less important in the low game, very important
when you start hitting MOBs that dispel.

I was in a Kedge group some time ago and the one person in my group who
*repeatedly* died was the druid... from drowning. If you start drowning,
even if you have EB up in a spell slot, it takes time to cast - you
probably won't survive.

Still, at Freeman's level he may want to sell it off at a high price
and buy another one when he's high enough level that he will need
it frequently.
