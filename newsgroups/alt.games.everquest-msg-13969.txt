Yes, that's all lovely.  However, I've yet to see anyone do more than 
speculate about what sort of password encryption EQ uses.  If they use a 
sufficiently strong encryption, then there's no worries, and Lokari is, in 
fact, relatively right.  The only way we could tell for sure is to go try 
to steal a password and see how tough it is.  So, LG, prove your point... 
what's my password?
