Last time my ranger tried to take boat from BB to freeport. When boat
arrived, my ranger stepped aboard, and immediately fell THRU the boat and
dropped into water below. He was swiming on the lower deck but just couldn't
get on the boat again. That was kind of funny. Luckily a nice druid ported
me to WC. So my ranger was actually lucky that he fell thru the boat. Note
that he didn't step off the boat. He fell right thru the middle of the deck.
