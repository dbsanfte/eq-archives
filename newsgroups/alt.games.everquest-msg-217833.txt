We took a pretty suboptimal group to nobles on Friday morning and I
didn't notice any difference. We camped the remains upstairs and I was
doing most of the offtanking so the rest of the group could
concentrate on killing one quickly. Didn't see the remains once but
did pick up 2 pairs of gloves in about 3 hours. 

My guess would be that you just got a higher percentage of the higher
level mobs (nobles, commanders) than usual. There's a pretty big
difference between the regular highborns (lvl 58) and the other mobs
there (lvl 63). 

Rgds, Frank
