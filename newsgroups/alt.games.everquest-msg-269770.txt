I don't have the game yet, but I'm thinkin' I'll get it within the next few
weeks.  So, is there a roleplaying server in EQ2?  I seem to remember
something about there not being one, but that a bunch of rpers were gonna go
to like the last server on the list or something like that...I
dunno...Anyway, if there is one, does it have any special rules like FV has
in EQ1?  Thanks in advance.
