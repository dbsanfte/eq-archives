Well.. first... if you have spent a lot of time in EQ.. you know that
everyone is greedy. Everyone.

The only time i've seen split guilds work is if neither guild knows of
the other. The moment your guild members find out someone is alt'ing
and splitting time over in another guild, you usually have an uproar
about it, regardless of if it is against the rules. Personally, just
be clear in your rule set and stick behind it. If you allow an officer
to do it... any member can do it.
