> Why did you ask for it then?

Basically, because I didn't have time to do a real examination of the
weapon, and we were unusually rushed because CC was falling apart and the
officers wanted to award this quickly.  I was extremely busy rezzing and
healing.  If this had been a more normal situation and I'd had a chance to
evaluate the mace versus my epic, I almost surely would not have asked for
it.  I would have had time to look up the effect and would have seen that it
wasn't terribly useful.

> Impulse + wasted merit = not good for characters gear building

Aye, and that was exactly what I was lamenting.  That because of a uniquely
harried situation I was awarded a piece of loot that isn't an upgrade for me
at all.

I'm usually much more judicious about what I ask for.  Recently when a very
nice FT4 cloak dropped, I refrained from asking to be in on the loot because
even though it would be a nice upgrade for me, I already have FT12 and there
are others in my guild who don't have many FT items at all.

I learned a lesson this time about making quick, uninformed decisions about
asking for loot.  In the future, I'll try and take just a bit more time.  It
might have helped me, for example, to have been aware of what Blood drops
and what I might want to go in on.
