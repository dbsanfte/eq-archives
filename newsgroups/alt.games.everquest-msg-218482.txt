Ah, but rule number 2 is that quoting the entire text of the message
you're replying to is bad. It's better to intersperse what you're
writing with the specific portions of the the message you're addressing
with your reply.

Well, that's it too. If you take the time to snip out the pieces that
are relevant, you keep the size of your post down, whilst making
sure that if someone were to come across your post in isolation
it would still be readable without needing other posts from the
same thread as context. If you top-post without editing what you're
replying to, every post becomes full of pages and pages of redundant
data, and that isn't good for obvious reasons (eg, creates storage
issues for archivers, more data = slower usenet and so on)
