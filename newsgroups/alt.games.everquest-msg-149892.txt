Both those places are good but I prefer Everfrost newbie area.

I just set myself up at the area with 3 igloos and kill any thing that
comes through there. You have to kill the skeletons, goblins, wolves, gnolls and bears to
get the spiders to spawn as well. This also has the side benefit of providing
some quality animal pelts as well. And you get bone chips that you can use in
several quests for faction or to make your necro friends happy. =)

A pet class works best here. If you are a druid charm one of the larger
animals out in the tundra area and bring it back to slaughter the newbie
critters, or your bear pet if you are high enough.
