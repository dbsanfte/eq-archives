I beg to differ. The old zones (and old character) modes display
EXACTLY the same as they did prior to the release of Luclin. (if you
do not install the "improved" textures or run the new models.) This
would indicate that the engine drawing the polygons on screen is NOT
significantly different at the core than it was when EQ launched. The
engine may be expanded or recoded to run inder DirectX8.1, but I would
be willing to bet that it is not "all new".
