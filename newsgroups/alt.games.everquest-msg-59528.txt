You've got something in there you missed ;)

All of these are still droppable for sure (just verified it)

Evil eye bag
Archeologist pack (or whatever)
Travelers pack (8 slot)
Herbalists pack
Dusty ransackers pack

The only no drop bag which is itself no drop that 
I have is the:

Rough leather sack, which was ALWAYS no drop since its
a quest from kerra ridge kitties (25 percent weight reduce, capacity
6)
