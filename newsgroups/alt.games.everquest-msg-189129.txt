This is really the only sticking point that we're even really
discussing anymore. On the rest of the points, you're so deeply
enmeshed in your bedrock assumptions (it's about oil, first, last, and
forever) that my thoughtful, well-reasoned (imo, of course) arguments
are clearly hitting your ears so that they sound like the teacher in
Peanuts.

But, on this one, you're missing my point by such a wide margin that
it's worth revisiting:

The United States went to the United Nations to ask it, as a body, to
put force behind a promise it has been making for twelve years, to
punish Iraq for aggression in Kuwait and oversee the dismantling of
its war machine so that it can't pull the same shit again. We're now
pissed at the UN and France as a UNSC member, not because we didn't
get our way, but because they have demonstrated a clear unwillingness
to make good the threats behind the sixteen resolutions they have made
to disarm Iraq since Desert Storm.

If the United Nations had had its way and the US had waited for them
to do something, we would not be debating giving the weapons
inspectors more time. Iraq expelled weapons inspectors and did not
allow them back in until under palpable threat of US military action.
There would be no inspectors without the threat of immediate and
overwhelming military action.

Even once the inspectors got back in, Iraq spied on them, blocked
access to sites and personnel, and made it clear that anyone who told
the inspectors anything worthwhile would face dire reprecussions. It
was clear that Saddam Hussein didn't think the UN had the backbone to
enforce even the most basic requirements of a legitimate inspection.
And, he was absolutely right.

We're mad at the UN for not doing its job. We're mad at the UN for not
living up to its promises. The UN has made it clear that it won't do a
goddamned thing about Hussein's open defiance of them until the bombs
actually start falling in Tel Aviv and then, they'll think about it.

The United States should have been keeping up pressure on Iraq for the
past twelve years. Every time Iraqi soldiers in the no-fly zones fired
on US planes (which they did more or less continuously) should have
resulted in a passle of cruise missiles right into the infrastructure.
When Saddam Hussein held a huge, public-to-the-world ceremony to
announce that he was upping the reward for the families of Shahids
(suicide bombers) from US$10,000 to US$25,000, we should have yanked
him out of Bagdad and made him stand trial like he was Noriega. When
Iraq started to balk the UN weapons inspectors, not allowing them to
engage in the agreed-upon inspections, we should have carpet-bombed a
palace a day until they changed their minds. When Hussein ordered
inspectors out of the country, we should have gone to war.

Why didn't we do any of this? Because the United Nations assured us
that they were dealing with the problems. When we went to the UN and
said, "He's still shooting at us. He openly supports terrorism. And,
he just kicked out the weapons inspectors. It's time to do something,"
the UN shrugged its shoulders and said, "Eh. Boys will be boys."
That's why we're furious.

I don't expect the UN to be an extension of US policy, but I don't
expect the US to be a branch of the UN either. Since the UN has
refused to build a coalition to force Saddam Hussein to comply or
resign, we have exercised our sovereign right to do so without their
approval.
