No graveyard in those zones, sorry charlie.

ToFS you need to have a key to get off the first floor and the exit off the  
second floor isn't in the same spot you zone in I remember a scary day when 
I went there with a group. Lucky I had a high level cleric friend who had 
keys.  The guy with the key logged out on us when he died.
