Good. :)

It beats leaving yet another rusty sword on the ground to rot.

That ultra critical rare kobold backbone required to craft a decent 
breastplate seems like a decent reward to me.

Nobody wants tradeskills to be an 'alternative to hunting'. Nobody wants 
to stand at a mine and click 'Mine Ore' for 8 hours a day. People want 
tradeskills and hunting to be incorporated.

Which is menial and dull... even the dedicated tradeskillers 'put up 
with it' ...they aren't enjoying that aspect of it.

So now the 'item' is a component to making an item. Its still a decent 
reward.


>I can go quest for something.

Which in EQ amounts to grab some friends and defeat foes to get an item.

I like quests, a lot, in theory it encourages people to move around, and 
take on fights that they'd otherwise skip. In EQ they're mostly badly 
done, but in general they are a very good idea. If your 'unnamed' game 
lacks them completely that is unfortunate, but if you can quest 
tradeskill items, then that works for me fine.

Which in EQ amounts to grab some friends and defeat foes to get an item 
to sell to a merchant to get some hard earned plat.

The good news is you can still buy stuff from other players with your 
hard earned plat in your unnamed game. And presumably you'll be able to 
sell stuff you loot from mobs. So your covered here.

And they are still pretty weak, overall.

Because it works exactly one of two ways if players can craft and mobs 
can drop:

1) Mob drops better stuff than players can make, so tradeskills are 
pointless.

2) Players make better stuff than mobs do... so mob drops are pointless.

The only solution is for mobs to drop stuff that can be crafted into 
better stuff. Now hunting is critical, and tradeskills are critical... 
they complement eachother instead of compete with eachother.

That at least sucks. Healers, buffers, debuffers, and crowd control 
classes are either 2nd class citizens getting screwed out of kill xp, or 
the above don't exist at all... either way is unfortunate.
