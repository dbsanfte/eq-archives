Taxi cab Confession:

My chanter had Drake scale legs well into the 50s. *blush*

Is it me or is there somewhat of a shortage for decent int caster
pants (mostly enchanter)? Sure there are some good items - but the
selection compared to other slots seems pretty thin. I have the Sandy
pants that you recommended to the OP - pretty nice and fairly cheap. I
also have the drop for the Candy pants from Thurg quest. Not sure I
wanna waste time to get a 15 sec casting time C1 when Im very close to
AA-Gather mana. Even after a rez, I can sit and med up to a C1's mana
requirement in less than 15 secs. I suppose to just say I did it
(whoopie).
