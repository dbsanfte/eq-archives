Actually, he may want to bite the bullet and go "upgrade" to Win98SE (or XP
if he's reinstalling anyway). Can probably find it at the discount software
store for $20. He could even use that spiffy USB port then.

While I sympathize with people who believe Microsoft is robbing them with
incrementally upgraded OS's, each with that ONE feature needed to run the
latest app, Win95a and OSR2 are getting pretty dated.

I was a Microsoft contrarian for a very long time, but resistance is
futile - you will be assimilated. I even use Explorer and Outlook Express
now. I'm so ashamed ...
