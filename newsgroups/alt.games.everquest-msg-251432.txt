Remember recast times:

Burning Sands
770/4.25 = 181 DPS
Black Steel
1400/8.5 = 164 DPS
Sun Vortex
1550/8.6 = 180 DPS

Burning sands is Evoc and a lower 
base efficiency than Sun Vortex, 
however you can get off the nuke on
runners and trash mobs more easily
and generate less aggro on boss mob
fights.  Makes it a nice option to
have around.
