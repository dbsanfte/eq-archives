Incorrect.

(The following *is* abridged, as I removed all references to pronunciation
and examples of usage.)

celibacy (from Latin celibatus in same sense, f. celbs, caelib-em
unmarried, single]  The state of living unmarried.

celibataire  A bachelor; one who is vowed to celibacy.

celibatarian
A - adjective.  Characterized by, or characteristic of, celibacy; inclined
to, or facouring celibacy.
B - One who lives in or advocates celibacy.

celibate
State of celibacy; order of celibates.

celibate [ f. Latin caelib-em unmarried + -ATE]
A - adjective.  Unmarried, single, bound not to marry.
B - One who leads a single life, a confirmed bachelor or spinster; one bound
not to marry.

celibate, verb.  To restrain from marriage; compel to celibacy.

The above are *all* of the definitions of the term as found in the OED.
Before impugning someone's research, bizbee, you might ASK if they removed
any definitions, or better yet, check for yourself.  And not with some
similar text; check the exact text that they specified they were using.


Further, using the MW Collegiate dictionary online, as you should have
access to it, it provides the following:

Main Entry: cel�i�ba�cy
Pronunciation: 'se-l&-b&-sE
Function: noun
Date: 1663
1 : the state of not being married
2 a : abstention from sexual intercourse b : abstention by vow from marriage

You will note that the FIRST entry is that of "the state of not being
married".



Encyclopaedia Britannica Online:

Celibacy - the state of being unmarried, usually in association with the
role of a religious official or devotee. In its narrow sense, the term is
applied only to those for whom the unmarried state is the result of a sacred
vow, act of renunciation, or religious conviction.



Annie, you said "I find it amusing that the original guy who took exception
to my use of the word "celibate" to mean sexual abstinence did so,
apparently, because I was using the _wrong_ dictionary definition."

I'd bet that when you originally used the term, you didn't use any
dictionary definition at all; you used what you *thought* was the correct
term.  You simply used "celibacy" in that context because you've seen others
use it that way, and assumed that they were using it correctly.



My original challenge (to Suineko) was:

What is the meaning of "celibacy"?

DO NOT simply respond saying what you THINK it means.  Go get a copy
of the OED and look it up, then post here with what you found.

Do keep in mind that it (now) has a secondary meaning associated with
it, due to rampant ignorance on the part of the population.  I want
the *primary* meaning.  In other words, look at both "celibacy" and
"celibate".



Final question.  Why is it that people, when they encounter a new word and
decide subsequently to use it, don't bother to look up the exact meaning, to
be sure that they're using it correctly?

There's a reason why it's called a chastity belt and not called a celibacy
belt.
