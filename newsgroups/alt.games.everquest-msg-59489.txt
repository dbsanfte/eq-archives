Oh, ok, I see. In DAoC, your side isn't allowed to assemble large
groups or include powerful members, but the other side is, so when
they, with their overwhelming numbers and super members attacks, your
side, which was restricted from having these abilities, is doomed.

I hadn't realized until now that there was a Realm in DAoC that was
limited in that fashion - I was operating under the mistaken
impression that the different Realms all had the same restrictions and
opportunities.

Tell me, please, which Realm is the restricted one. I'm playing in
Hibernia, and I'd hate to find out that I'm in a Realm which can never
assemble large groups or have powerful individuals.
