    Hadden is one of the biggest mistakes in EQ. There should never be an
NPC on a long static timer with a rare drop in a wide-open, "easy" area.
It's an invitation to exactly the sort of problems you listed. Shorten the
timer and make the drop rarer. Shorten the timer and use a placeholder to
control item rarity. Or, by far preferable, put the Fishbone Earring in a
challenging dungeon so it isn't trivial yet boring to obtain.
