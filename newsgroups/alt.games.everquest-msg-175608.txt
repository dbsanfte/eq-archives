I was at a kill once, I won't say I MT'd it because we didn't allow
it to do squat, between my then 53 Paladin and a 54-ish Enchanter it
was stunned the entire fight.  The Cleric worked from a walk-through,
took him about 20 minutes or so to find the correct mob, then he
made the trip back to the zoneline once to make sure he knew the
route.  It was an easy fight, somebody was botting a 60 monk as an
extra damage dealer, but since the PP was stunned the entire time
and we ended at over 50% mana I'd say that was unnecessary.
