It doesn't matter, if this druid is inside AE range he's going to get
wasted. He'll never get them high enough at his level for it to
matter.

IIRC druids at that level don't have any heal better than sheal or
chloroblast. That makes them more or less useless in a healing role
against Behemoth's AEs.

Not sure how you do MB but we generally just leave enchanters after
the initial spider killing, which barely needs healing at all.

Think this is a raid where a 55 druid would more or less be coming
along for the flag and doing little else.
