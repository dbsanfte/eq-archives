Okay ron, allow me to lay out some more cards on the table.  I can do better
than what's about to follow.  Keep that in mind, for googles sake.

Ron really wanted to post this other victims personal information on the
Internet, in a really *bad* way.
So he said on the 13th of May, 2001:

om

But he needed *more* justification, so, he sent this to an anonymous
re-mailer, *nothing* he wouldn't tell someone if they asked, *nothing* that
wasn't outdated or incorrect, and *just* spicy enough:

On the 15th of May our friend ron sent the above.  You've all seen it
before.

Guess what, ron was now justified.  So he posted this:

So long, sorry you had to leave the newsgroup yet one more time with
your balls smashed all over the inside of your pants, whining and
crying, looking back over your shoulder to make sure I'm not following
you.

....and keep those cards and letters coming in kids! That's:

XXXX XXXX
XX9 Xrd Street
XXX XXX, XXX XXX

ph. XXX.XXX.XXX (feel free to call 24/7)

his old webpage may or may not still be:
http://www.narlys.com
I wasn't able to connect, but that's happened in the past too.

Bye bye tony, drop around anytime for spelling lessons, ball smashing
and total embarassment. We're happy to abuse you any time.

I removed the name and address but they can be found in the above link if
you're so inclined to look.

Now that I've *proven*, you're a kook, who stalks himself, ron.  You know,
to justify being a complete dick.   The above evidence is clear as a bell,
now isn't it, ron?

Aren't you the same ron a. green, the chef from California that spits in his
customers food?  Yes, you are.
