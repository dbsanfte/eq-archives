Oh good, I didn't actually want to be on your KF, your post just read badly
to me.

The "Considered opinion" that I mentioned actually comes from general zone
chat of what people believe...most of which I must say is from DL so it is
likely a case of people with a little knowledge being dangerous, admittedly
a lot of this talk turns to trash talk about "my class being better than
yours" at which point my ignore list fills up.
As I said I really have no comment on the high end game as I am not there
and in no rush to be there, looks to much like hard work to me.
