The wife and I run our two accounts on a dialup modem.  We have noticed 
some additional lag recently and your explanation of the cause makes 
sense.  So far it's still playable as long as we stay away from crowded 
areas.  We were supposed to go on a raid this weekend though, and I 
don't think we'll be able to.

When at a friend's house a group of us sometimes run up to 7 accounts on 
one cable connection.  We find when several of us use autofollow things 
get so bad that the router usually has to be reset.  Otherwise we have 
been fine so far.

Whimper!

Try some different areas and play with your filters a bit if you haven't 
yet.  Be sure you have /serverfilter on of course.  I'd think Verant 
would find this a burden on their ISPs as well, so I wouldn't be 
surprised if they tweak it a bit more.
