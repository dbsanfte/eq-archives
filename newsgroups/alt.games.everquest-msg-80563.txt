If I were you, I'd save my money for a little while. Geforce4 and ATI's R300
are supposedly out next month.

As for brand, most of the cards are all very similar, its just the bundles
that are different. But, as someone else

mentioned, Elsa is always a safe bet. Never had any problems with the ones
I've had.

Cheers!
