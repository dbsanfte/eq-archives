5.  Don't power-level your bard up.  I'm a slow-ass leveler, but a
bard takes time to mature.  The bards these days have it too easy.  In
my day it took us 100 days /played to make 60, and damn it, we liked
it!  We didn't have any pussy level 20 manasong to get groups, so we
solo'd our blue butts off.  It made us better men, and sexier.
