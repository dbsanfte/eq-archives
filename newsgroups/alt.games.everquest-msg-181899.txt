I'm sure it's nothing to most of the veteran players on this board but it was
pretty damn exciting for me.  Was sitting at derv 3 in NRO when he went
strolling by right behind the camp.  He was yellow to me but I kited him for
about a half an hour and finally took him out.  He dropped a scepter of Rahotep
a crappy 1h bash weapon but it was a blast.
