Realism? I wouldn't go that far. The way they stand is just *wrong*,
especially the women.

I prefer the old models in all cases except high elf, human, iksar and
erudite.

The hair is the best part of the new models, I really wish we could
adjust hair on the old ones. The faces are rather poor, however, the
old faces were better.

And I absolutely love the Vah Shir, best model to date in any mmorpg
so far. Iksar a close second.
