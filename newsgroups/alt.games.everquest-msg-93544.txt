Sorry if I come off rude when I say this, but... <gasp> God forbid they're
asked to help someone! Oh the horror of having to deal with other people!

'The 'proper way' to you may not be the same for others. I, personally, find
it rude to ask for some things in OOC... especially since the entire zone
gets to hear you for a long time (circumstances vary, of course). You should
have the stones to say "No."

I rarely ever die, get SOW, get ports, or buffs unless I'm in a group. So I
don't have a lot of experience asking for things, but if someone tells me
"No" I accept it. If they ignore me, I consider them extremely rude and move
on... I don't insult or berate them unless they decide that they're
something special and acts rudely towards me.

I find the 'paying well' thing sort of interesting... you're trying to be a
businessman by charging for your service. So the customer decides to screw
you over by using your own greed and lures you to the mystery of what
exactly 'well' is. Heh, that's how it works in the real world... unless you
state a fee for a service, expect to get some lint and a penny.

If someone offers a -donation- it's whatever he or she likes. Considering in
your instance, the person donating for the SOW was a newbie. Damn newbies to
Hell for not being wealthy enough to pay you an exorbinant amount of money
to satisfy your desires!

It's like donating $5 to the Red Cross and finding out they weren't grateful
for it. Every little bit helps.

You might as well say, "Well, I'll except a minimum of 40 pp for the port,
but you can always pay me more..."

> I think I'm jaded and their the ones who jaded me.

I don't know... "avarice" comes to mind...
