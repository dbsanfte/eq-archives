Nah, not quite, give it another couple years before you say that; we had 
a theoretical high end speed about the equivalent of 4 Ghz (Cyber 
205)... although a more normal operating speed would admittedly be more 
on the order of 0.34Gz... but then I'll warrent most desktops are also 
normally not performing at their theoretical optimum speed.

Too, of course that was with a mere 32 meg of memory, which would be put 
to shame by any desktop today, same for the 7.2 gig disk memory; we 
actually had to run a Cyber 835 as a file server, which would still only 
extend that to an anemic 20 gig.

It was admittedly a lot more impressive in '85
