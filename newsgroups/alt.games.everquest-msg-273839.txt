On my server it would have been longer than 3 days. What difference does it 
make that its in a dictionary since you obviusly didnt use it in other than 
a cursing way.

Especially for use of leet speak. After all, what is that other than 
recognition that the word might be banned or blocked so its an effort to 
get around the rules.

Language controls are a great thing. They have been proven to raise the 
average age of the player base
