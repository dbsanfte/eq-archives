You do know this is usenet, right?

You do know that posts are not guaranteed to be 
delivered in any order, or at all, right?

You do know that many high volume servers tend
to delete posts within a couple of days, right?

You obviously know all this (as it's very basic
information) so you also obviously post as a
form of mental masturbation, because posting without
context accomplishes nothing.
