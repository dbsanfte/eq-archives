Nah you were definitly in the right. You offered to share that is all you
are required to do.

This is why I never hunt places like these. The same well known tried and
true static easy spawns like the aviaks that people love to camp. Boooooring.
There are many other places to hunt in this game, why put up with the aggravation.
If a zone has people say "CampCheck!" every 15 minutes that is a zone
you will never see me in. This game is so huge and getting bigger every day. I have
seen many zones no one or very few are ever in. Go out and adventure a little
people! Sheesh.
