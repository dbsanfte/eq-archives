The likely context for "wait until damage increases" would be for
effective use of weapons with base damage above 14 (i.e. most two-
handers and high damage one-handers).

Under L10 your damage is capped at 21, regardless of weapon base damage
rating.  L10 thru L19 your damage is capped at 29 (supposedly with very
high strength it's possible to exceed this cap by one or two at L18 or
L19, never seen it though).  At L20 and above your maximum damage per
hit is no longer capped and you can use high damage weapons (most two-
handers, for example) at full effectiveness.  Finally, starting at L28
melee classes get a bonus to primary hand equipped weapons that scales
with level (two-handers get higher bonus damage than one-handers,
based on the delay of the two-hander).  So at L20 and above your max
damage per hit is your weapon's base damage multiplied by a value
determined from  your skill in the weapon, your STR stat, and possibly
your level (never seen a formula that was 100% accurate, unfortunately),
plus your damage bonus if the weapon is equipped in the primary hand.
The minimum value for max damage appears to be (2 * WeaponBaseDmg + 1),
though if your skill is very low you may not manage to hit that hard.

Dual Wield skill determines the likelihood that your off-hand weapon
will get an attack, last formula I saw was ((Level + DualWield) / 600)
which is at least pretty close, if not completely accurate.

Double Attack skill, which you will be able to train soon, determines
whether you will get a second attack with your weapon(s).  For primary
(and 2H) weapon the formula I've seen is ((Level + DoubleAttack) / 500).
Again, this is pretty close, if not perfect.  I've never seen a formula
for off-hand double attack, but supposedly it can't happen until L29 or
later.
