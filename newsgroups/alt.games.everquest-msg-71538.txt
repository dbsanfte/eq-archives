It's been a while since I cancelled my EQ subscription, but after playing
the awful Anarchy Online and the dull DAoC, I'm thinking of reactivating my
EQ account. However, I don't think I'll bother if my old characters are gone
and I have to start from scratch. Is there any way to find out if they are
still there without forking out some cash just to check? I checked the
support pages but can't find anything in there about it.

TIA for your replies.
