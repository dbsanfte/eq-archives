No class is useless.  Every class has a role, even on post-Velious raids.  
The fact that a certain class isn't an absolute requirement to make the 
raid happen doesn't mean that they're not useful.

I can't think of a single class that you can do without on the truly tough 
raids.  You may not need 6 of 'em, but they all have uses.

Druids:  circle buffs, healing AE damage, etc
Necros:  DMF (we didn't have a necro on spawned Trak yesterday, had 5 die)
Pallys:  DA pull certain mobs, take a DT, melee damage
SK:	 melee damage, tough pulls, regen stoppers
Shaman:  slows slows slows, and buffs
Chanter: Brain buffs and haste, oh and tash
Mages:   Nukes, and whatever debuff they use, malo?
Bards:   Resists, OOS, mana
Ranger:  Melee damage and quite a bit of it, tracking
Monk:    Pulling and damage
Rogue:   Melee damage, CR
Warrior: Duh!
Cleric:  Duh!
Wizard:  Nukes
Beastlord:  OK, maybe this one class isn't needed, but probably just 
hasn't had 30 months of experience to know the end-game role yet.

Ummm, I really think that Sui's main is a ranger, the druid is a twink.  
Contrary to popular belief ranger's aren't useless, even on big raids.  
Neither are druids, or any other class.  Yeah, there really isn't a need 
for 6 necros on a 24 man raid, but 6 warriors would be kind of a waste 
too.
Any well played character, of the appropriate level, can function in a 
group in any zone in the game.  Sure there are some very rare mobs that 
are completely MR, but these are the exception.  
In the past two weeks my guild has dropped Sev with 15, melee heavy and 
Hoshkar with 30, only 2 wizards.  For Hoshkar we had at least 1 of every 
class, and other than 5 clerics, I don't think we have more than 3 of any 
other class.  Our server uberguild said they bring 6-8 wizards every time.  
Do wizards help?  You bet!  Could we have been successful without our 
druids there too?  Probably not.
No class is useless.  Many players are.
