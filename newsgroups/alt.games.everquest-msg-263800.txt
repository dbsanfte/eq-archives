Maybe they're really gnomish automated looms that will happily chop
off your limbs if you're not careful.  They don't look like that,
unfortunately, but that's a minor detail. ;-)

I do think it's a little silly that you die - having some sort of
catastrophic failure that gives you exp debt and takes a little while
to clean up after would make more sense, to me, and would achieve the
same effect in game, since AFAIK all crafting happens in safe spots
anyway.  Even with a forge you'd have to work hard to actually get
killed, I think.

But I'm sure this has been discussed to death already on the beta
forums.
