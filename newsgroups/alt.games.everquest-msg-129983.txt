Also depends on what you mean by optimal, a couple additional points:

A group that includes a druid can quickly get to many different hunting
grounds as the whim strikes them.

My main is a paladin, so I don't mind at all having a druid as main
healer since I can back her up myself and our buffs complement.

Most importantly, for me an optimal group consists of friends and/or
people I think I'd like to have as friends.  I don't care whether your
toon needs help crossing the street or solos dragons for kicks, if I
like you you're in and if I don't like you you're out.  And if you
judge/select groupmates primarily by your notions of class power and
efficiency the odds are I won't like playing with you.
