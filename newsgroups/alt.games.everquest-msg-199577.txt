Somebody posted about watching their young child do this while
playing.  And after thinking about that and about what I've seen
watching my children interact with strange kids at playgrounds,
I suspect that most of these aren't from kids under 10 or so.
Young kids often don't start conversing with new playmates until
after they've spent some time in their company.  I've never had
one of these silent invites outside a newbie zone, nor from a
character above L12 or so.  So when a L7 invited my (then) L35
Druid without a word, I first buffed her up and then refused the
invite with a couple kind words on the assumption that it was a
little kid being "normal".
