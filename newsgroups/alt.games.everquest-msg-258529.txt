Well, yes, I have.  For example, I readily and freely admit, I am not a 
competent druid.  In fact, I make a pretty sucky healer in general.  If 
it's gonna be much more complicated than casting one heal every mob or 
so, I'll bot something else, like a rogue or something.

Heh. :)  Hopefully, in that intervening week, he'll go do some research on 
exactly how to play a pet class. :)  But if someone were in that position, 
I don't think /pet hold would somehow magically make them a good pet class 
player.

Well, as I said, that pretty much -is- our rule.  Or rather, there is no 
rule in the bylaws about it, and the raidleader is generally busy making 
groups and stuff when someone pipes up asking, "hey, are pets allowed on 
this raid?" and someone else says "if you have /pet hold, it should be 
fine."

So mostly, it comes down to trying to figure out for myself, on an 
encounter by encounter basis, whether my silly animation is a reasonable 
choice.  Obviously, if the raidleader (who's generally a smart fellow, 
even if he -is- a monk) says 'no pets without /pet hold on this one', I 
take that rather seriously.  He also generally gives a reason why, when he 
says that, though, like "this guy as a HUUUUUGE AE".

But it seems pretty clear to me, really, that /pet hold isn't the holy 
grail be-all end-all of being a pet user.  9 times in 10, a person who's 
paying attention can do pretty much as well with /pet back off.  And an 
incompetent fool can mess up almost as badly with /pet hold as without.

So maybe, if we could stop that random guy from saying 'everyone without 
/pet hold kill your pets!' we might end up with a bit more much-needed 
DPS.  Generally random_guildie_036 has good advice, but on this one, like 
the one about chanter nukes, I think he may be a bit offbase.
