Healing Agro in Planes of Power

                               We are aware that there is a
problem with healing generating too much agro (upsetting the
monsters)
                               in Planes of Power. We are working
on a fix for this problem. It should show up on the Test server
fairly
                               soon, but we probably will not
have it ready for the patch tonight.

Hmm.

I've said many times that healing aggro in POP is outrageous.
But frankly its made the game a great deal more fun for me.  POP
has been a challenge, timing heals, choosing to HOT over regular
healing, getting Divine Arbitration... and yes, occaisionally
getting aggro despite my best intentions because it was that or
let someone die... so I'm running in circles till the adds get
rooted or mezed because they WILL kill me if I use the old "stand
there and suck it up till a tank taunts if off" plan.

I honestly thought the high heal aggro was a "feature" or as they
like to put it "working as intended"

Heck, now anyone will be able to do the job, and demand for
Skilled clerics will drop, its revenge of the Bots!
