If you were only playing Selo's, and you didn't aggro the bixie, it's a 
bug.  Bard's don't get AE buffs until 54, but they do get an AE damage 
song at level 2.  If you haven't learned this yet the hard way, DON'T PLAY 
CHORDS OF DISSONANCE ANYWHERE NEAR TOWN OR GUARDS.  That may save you a 
couple of needless deaths.  :)

I've heard of this happening fairly often, I suspect that Kael is slightly 
buggy faction-wise.  I'm sure some of the giant-murdering clerics here can 
provide more details.
