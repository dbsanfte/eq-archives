[snip horror story]

this might be too obvious a solution....always works for me, but i'm not
sure if our reasons for LD'ing are the same

spam "/w all friend" "/w all wiz 65" or "/w all GUILD" --whichever pulls up
the most names -- *right* before you zone

you query the server, it hits you back with that information, and you seem
to have more of the server's attention; you should zone a teeny bit faster
and possibly avoid ld'ing during zonetime

it's worked for me

OT, i got the idea from a friend of mine, who once got tickets to a very
popular show by calling ticketmaster about 1 hour before the tickets were
going on sale...he asked tons of questions, had to be transferred, and just
bugged the hell out of the people he spoke with until the hour was up, and
then he said something like "oh by the way, i'd like to purchase tickets to
the ..."yada yada

i'm not sure if he was exaggerating or whatnot, but it was an amusing
anecdote

=P
