    KC exp sucked right away for me... but that's just me I guess everyone
else seems to rave about it.

    I think the bit you might have missed in the above post was:

    How many level 48 characters can be buffed out to "almost 4k" hp I
wonder... I'm imagining there are basically two main groups: Twinks, and
nobody.

    I would say to guess Justin's dwarf's AC is probably up over 1200
unbuffed as well if he can hit that many hp with virtue/shammy buffs. Still,
with level 48 defense/parry/dodge/etc VS very red mobs, I would imagine the
group would have done better letting the 65 beastlord tank. I've noticed
those guys have very little trouble obtaining agro at least.
