In case anyone is wondering what exploit was fixed I will post it
below.  I got this off of http://www.rpgexpert.com/964.html

The situation is this: There are two factions in the Arena area of
Plane of Tactics. Essentially, half of the area is on one faction, the
rest is on the other. Heres the trick:

A chanter can charm a wraith and sick it on a mob of the opposite
faction. Once the charmed wraith begins to cast a spell, the enchanter
breaks his charm very quickly (for example: uses an invis potion), and
when the wraith finishes its spell -- The mob it casts on begin to
fight again attacks the wraith and the wraith fights back -- WITHOUT
being charmed. Now, the group begins to use low aggro spells or simple
aggro range to train these two mobs that are fighting. This
essentially creates a war. EXP and Loot is awarded to the entire group
for every mob that dies.
