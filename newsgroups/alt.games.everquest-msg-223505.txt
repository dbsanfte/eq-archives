Thematic conclusion for a story concerning Time, eh? Thanks, once again, for
providing a fascinating (and fyi rare) glimpse into how the uber-half lives.
The comforting reality, of course, is that it's not that different in many
ways from what the rest of us go through. I remember your stories about
Monual falling asleep during a raid, and the fanatical obsession that took
him down the tortuous path toward GM Smithing (I still remember the line:
"Brewing ... hmmm", lol), and now this, the crushing disappointment of
missing out on a loot decision. It's this personalization of Monual that's
the highlight of the stories. Keep them coming!
