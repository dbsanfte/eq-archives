Everyone in range of the mez break gets the message ( or, at a minimum, the 
one breaking it, the one who cast it, providing they are "in range" ).  I 
didn't even know it was there until a guildie of mine pointed out that he 
was seeing the message.  I moved closer and I saw it, too.

My pets didn't break 1 mez yesterday, and they had ample opportunity.
