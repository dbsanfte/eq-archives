What are the most recommended tactics for fighting as a LV29 Necro (finally
hit 29 tonight)?  I'm noticing many of my spells are a replacement of older
ones (the leach & lifetap ones, also the snare/DoT).

Also where can I find my LV29 pet spell?  I wasn't at Neriak (or at least
not with the usual merchants), or in Freeport, or in the library in Plane of
Knowledge (which is where I bought all but 4 spells at).

I also can't find Vampiric Curse (my replacement for leach life...DoT
lifetap).

And where in Echo Caverns is Eternities Torment (my massive damage undead
DoT)?
