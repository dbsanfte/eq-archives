I think your *first* best bet will be as an earlier poster suggested. Do
you know of any other folks in your neck of the woods who play? If you
could just borrow the CDs for one day, you'd be back on the road since
you still have your account name and password, and the key on your CD
case if you need it.
  Any friends in the States? Finding CDs, in use or otherwise is
probably a lot more common than in Europe.
  Aside from that, sad to say, you may be forced to order a new one. I
don't think there's anyplace you can download it. And even if you could,
I shudder to think how long that would take on the very best internet
connection available.
