Finally made it to the Firepot room to check things out the other night.  I
was backing up to get some distance between the skeleton (didn't know if he
would try to eat me or not) before I dropped invis.  I backed into a random
firepot and it gated me.  To Grobb.  No, I am not a troll shammy.  This was
a very bad thing.

I started to gate out, and of course this dropped invis.  A nasty troll
started to beat on me, but thankfully my gate did not interrupt.  WHEW!
Lesson learned the hard way.  You don't always have to click on those things
to set them off.
