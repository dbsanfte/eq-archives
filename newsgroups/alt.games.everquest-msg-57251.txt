Indeed and I never once saw any complaints on any of the servers whee
substantial groups of non-english speakers could be found. I often saw
German or French used in extended conversation on Torvonnilous and no
problem.

I think it boils down to a certain claim I heard in the lake of ill
manners last night where someone was shouting out that shout was
restricted to the English language by the EULA and that others shold be
removed to OOC....now I must admit I've not been through the EULA or other
rules with a fine toothcomb but I dont rememebr that..anyoe able to
confirm it or blow it out of the water.

Yes, I do...assuming you mean europhobic along with the bigoted. We see
the same issue on quake and counterstrike servers...

> What makes it worse is that these people are more than likely from the UK

Almost guaranteed, on those fps's its always 'UK server speak english
arsehole' or similar...never seen the reverse on a German or Dutch
server..saw it once on a French server but then 2 fanboys were on there
demanding the entire 32 player server switch to English for their benefit
and being really arsey aboutit.

Of course it would be nice to have everyone talking ni a language everyone
understands, but a) we dont all speak Esperanto, and b) if you really need
to communicate with someone then mostly the non-English speakers can
and will communicate in English to help since it functions as a common
language to some extent in the real world...but Europe is mixed and you
will get guilds and groups who wish to talk in non-English languages...let
them do it.
