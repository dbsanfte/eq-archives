Ok.  The reason I asked is that crashing to the server-select
screen, or the login screen, is almost always a connection
problem (although that problem can be anywhere from your computer,
to Verant's servers, or any part of the internet in between).

Crashing to the desktop, however, is almost always a problem
on your computer, I've never seen connection problems blow
the whole EQ program away.
