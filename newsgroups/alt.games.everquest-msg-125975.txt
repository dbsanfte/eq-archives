Hm, I've wondered about that before myself.  I've always kind of wanted a 
Gideon Bible...  the only version approved by Rocky Raccoon.  But I've 
never seen one with a phone number, and couldn't decide if it was meant to 
be taken or not, so I've always left them.

Of course what I'd -really- like is a "Buggre Alle Thys" Bible, as 
Aziraphale has in Good Omens by Terry Pratchett.  But it probably doesn't 
really exist.  Oh well. :)
