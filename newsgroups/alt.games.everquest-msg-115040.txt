Yes, although you need a magical weapon to do melee damage to them, so make
sure the ranger is one.  Watch out for incoming wisps while you are
fighting.  If you see one heading toward you, try casting Harmony on it.
Normally, you think of casting Harmony on stationary mobs, and then pulling
one away, but it should work just as well on a moving mob to let it move by
without joining the fight.

The big thing you have to watch out for, because it is totally different
from any other place you are likely to have fought, is that you can't easily
run away if you get in trouble.

Before Luclin, I kept my 52 Wizard bound on the wisp island.  That way, if
we had a bad wipeout on a raid, I could kill wisps while waiting for my res.
(With Luclin, I stay bound in Luclin, so that I don't have to wait for the
stupid portals to go up).
