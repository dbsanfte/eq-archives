Did I say 'advanced' anywhere?
I said EQ2 is more complex, harder, with a steeper learning curve than
WoW.   The experience MMORPGer could get to max level in Wow in a
fraction of the time it'd take in EQ2, and then, there's a high chance
they'll get bored of the game sooner (for those people that like to
race to max level and then get bored).
Several dungeons in EQ2 require you to perform complex quests, many of
them requiring full groups to complete.  This is what I meant by
complex.  To some people, this is a stupid approach, and thus, are the
type of people that like games like WoW and CoH where they can advance
at their own pace and not miss much content.  To others, this is what
makes a MMORPG for them, needing other people, trusting in their
capabilities, do your job and hope for the best... these are the type
of people that like games like EQ2.
A game being complex doesn't make it better or more advanced than
another, just makes it attractive to some types of players.

Just for the record, City of Heroes could be considered one of the
simpler games out there (no inventory, no loot, no crafting, etc) yet
it's the most enjoyable MMORPG I've ever played.
