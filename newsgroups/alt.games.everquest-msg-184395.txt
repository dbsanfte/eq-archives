The randomized draft is coming to the United States to choose people
completely at random to serve their country(i.e. die so that the new
population of less aggressive, more intelligent males can reproduce as they
are the ones who make societal technological advancements without which
society would collapse, hehehehe that's so sad and pathetic but it is the
truth) I will not likely be chosen as I am mentally ill, or maybe I will,
that would actually be a fitting end for my life to die on the front lines
in some far away country and a good use of human resources too.
