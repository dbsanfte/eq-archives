Gotta love the nipple tassels on the bathrobe... my gnome magician
will never have one. She has a gossimer robe (pretty white) and an
advisor robe for when she is older - it does clash a little with her
hair and eyes *sniffle*. The blackened crystalline robe is lovely, and
I really like the froglok bonecaster robe as well. If my mage ever
gets really big, I'll be aiming for that baby (I'm allowed to dream!)
