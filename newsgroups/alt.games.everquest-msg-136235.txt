Actually there are already monitors that are bigger than that. I've heard of
up to 29"+ (mostly 23, 25, 27, 29").  And the price just keeps going up.

WOW! Just checked http://www.pricewatch.com and a KDS brand 21" for only
$332.

Anyone know if KDS is a good brand?  I've personally only had NEC to this
point, and never had a problem with them.  I don't need perfectly flat
screen, my 19" has a slight curve to it (front center sticks out maybe
1/4-3/8 inch from the sides).
