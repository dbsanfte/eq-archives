Since you don't mention finding some 40-ish people to con your pet to make
sure both your pets are the same level, I'm not sure how valid your results
are.  What if you had the absolute best pet possible and he had one 3 levels
lower that managed to beat yours.  Wouldn't that prove that the armor was
effective?

In other words, either you did and didn't say, or you didn't test it
properly.
