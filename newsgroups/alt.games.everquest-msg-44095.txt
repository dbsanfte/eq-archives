The odd thing is that I have pretty much concluded that my problems
were all network related.  Some in-depth troubleshooting on my side
led to several routers in the NYC area having problems, affecting
AT&T, Level3, and PNAP.  My primary provider is downstream of PNAP,
and EQ is connected via AT&T and Level 3 (Cerfnet is now AT&T's
network).  I'm still not sure why I'm seeing the terrible packetloss
when it comes, but I'm seeing enough route-flaps to cause all sorts of
problems.  It's mostly limited to EQ and a couple other west coast
sites, and I think last night may have been related to the telethon
(follow very similar path to Yahoo, which hosted telethon pages).
