Pick 3, pick 3!  No, pick 2!!  NO, pick 1!!  Oh hell, I dunno.

The first one I ever saw sold went for 12k.  The next one went for 5k.  Last
one I saw sold went for 2k.

Nope, has to go in primary or secondary.

The reason for the confusion is that this weapon has been changed. 
Originally it had a *proc* of a variable haste spell that was equal to
"level +1" up to a max of 50.  So at level 10, it would proc a 11% haste
spell, and at level 50 it would proc a 50% haste spell.  That was too good. 
Combined with a rogue's 40% haste in main hand and a *proc* of 50% in the
off hand, rogues were moving faster than rangers/monks (the kings of solo
haste).

Now, though, it is much simpler.  The velium swiftblade is a straight 40%
haste item.  Just like a FBSS, CoF, or rogue epic, it's 40% *item* haste.

This makes an awesome rogue twink weapon for the off hand.  It's light, 40%
haste, and looks cool.

Tough to say.  40% haste is awesome, better than CoF.  5/24...  not so hot. 
Your off hand is not 1/2 of your damage, though.  I think off hand accounts
for maybe 1/5 or so of your total swings, if that.  So using a wimpy weapon
with a great effect in the off hand isn't a terrible option.

I tested on my 51 ranger and a lamentation with a CSS using an RBG for haste
was outdamaged by the lamentation and velium swiftblade.  Pretty impressive
to go from a 12/24 to a 5/24 and do *more* damage when you were already
using a RBG.

Then I got rid of it.  I couldn't switch out to 2h weapons for any reason or
I would lose haste.  Minor complaint really, but it was enough for me to
ditch it.  Besides, eventually I'll get around to doing epic with my ranger. 
:)

The *only* way to tell if your damage gets better or worse is to parse it
yourself.  Copeland's can give you an idea for purposes of comparison, but
has many flaws.
