On my 900 MHz Athlon, 768 MB RAM, GeForce 2 GTS 64 MB, Windows XP,
here's what I've found so far:

1. 1024x768, high quality textures, all models, mip mapping on, the
Nexus and the zone adjacent where I bought spells are OK, except when
turning.  They are a little choppy, but I can get around OK.

2. Same setup, started a kitty (I have no desire to play a kitty...but
I wanted to see an outdoor zone, to see what the graphics were like,
and figured starting a kitty and finding the newbie zone would be
faster than finding an outdoor zone from the Nexus), the kitty
starting city was horrible.  Very choppy.  Pulling the clipping plane
all the way in and dropping back to medium textures had no noticable
effect.

3. Still in medium textures, I found my way outside.  Outside was a
*lot* smoother than inside.  It was still choppy enough to be
annoying...but it was kind of playable.  I wonder what it would be
like to do a raid there?

4. Playing one of my old chars in EC was fine.
