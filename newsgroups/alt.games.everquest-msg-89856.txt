Taking the advice here that should have been obvious to me, I had been
/auctioning to buy banded armor for my Iksar warrior, as well as trying
to sell some silk swatches and bone chips. Well, I found a guy in town
who was a tailor looking to buy silk. Made a nice deal and a tidy sum of
plat. (I was anticipating that I would need 80 to 100 plat for a full
suit of banded, and my last sales put me up to around 110 PP in the
bank, so I was hopeful.)

When the transaction is done, I figure I have nothing to lose and I ask
the guy if he knows any blacksmiths. He informs me immediately that his
main is a smith, what do I need? I tell him and he camps out and logs in
his main. (Also camped at the bank.) I ask him how much, he shrugs and
just says "you buy the materials, I'll make it."  He then groups with me
"so you can see my failures and successes" and we head to the forge and
smithing merchant. Turns out that the guy is a Grand Master Smith and he
doesn't have one failure. I bought 25 sheets of metal for him, and all
the molds once, and he cranked out a full suit for me. I thanked him
heartily, and offered a paltry cash donation for his generousity (he
refused) and then he had me buy some weapons part molds and made me a
new sword which was a upgrade to my old tarnished one I had looted! We'd
had quite a while to chat by then, and when we got finished, he invited
me into his guild! (New guild, all Leezard, probably not a forever
thing, but at least it's somebody to talk to and maybe get a group with
later on. They are all much higher level.)

So, new friend, new weapon, and new suit of banded with VERY hyped up
armor stats, all for under fifty plat. Not too shabby. I should be in
Kurns this weekend. He he he.
