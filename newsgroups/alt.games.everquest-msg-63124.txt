I just got an EQ newsletter with links to a couple flash movies
and one of the movies showed some text that said "Over 1000
new spells and creatures"

One thousand? 1000?

Ok at Caster's Realm I looked over the new luclin spell list
and see 132 new spells there. So that leaves 868 new creatures?
I can't buy that. They must be counting all the flavors of mobs
that look exactly the same but just have a different name like: a gnoll,
a scrawny gnoll, a gnoll brewer, a gnoll captain, a burly gnoll, a whimpy gnoll,
a kinda bigger gnoll, a badass gnoll, a king gnoll, a queen gnoll, a type A gnoll,
a Type B gnoll, etc.

Riiiight, like they had time to make 868 new creature models. Ok so they are
exaggerating to make an advertising slogan, not really a lie just an embellishment,
but come on gimme a break! =)
