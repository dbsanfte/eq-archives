 I'm sure if it were just us in Time we would probably pace it a little
slower as well. It's a marathon to do the whole thing in one night,
epecially if your normal start times are around 10EST. We just wanted to
know we could do it that fast since the guild ahead of us took about two
months to get to that point. Plus we need to know we can push that fast
for when the next guild enters Time behind us. Which wont be long if
they only need Coirnav. I'd guess within two weeks they'll probably be
in.

>Ldon... heh

 I've noticed LDON raids aren't even announced anymore. I'm thinking
they don't want to scare people away from logging on. Heh.

 That basically sums it up better than I could. I mean, I know the Time
level ones are supposed to be hard. But the scale is tipped more towards
'stupid' than 'challenging'. The elemental level ones aren't as hard
(obviously) but even they suck.

 LDON is fine for the single grouping aspect to get your augs and
whatever. But as from a raiding standpoint I think SOE missed the mark.

 You mean this: http://rpgexpert.com/1105.html 

 I think it's lame myself. It's an interesting concept but doesnt scale
to EQ raids in my opinion. It also means half your melee is going to be
sitting around doing nothing on half the raids. They other half of your
melee the other time.

 We haven't had to reform yet. I'll keep that in mind and pass it along
to the officers in case they don't already know.

 Haven't really encountered any of those issues as far as I can tell.

 Well I was close. So then subtract 15 mins and that makes an instance
13.25 hours long if all my other numbers are correct.

 In theory. Maybe it was just bugged a different way that time then
because another raid got our instance. Luckily they were nice enough to
leave Quarm where they found him,

 But that was around the time of the GoD beta people so that could have
had something to do with it. It (usually) works as it should. The main
one is people not closing it like they should after killing Quarm.

Regardless, there are some definite bugs still remaining in Time.

 Oh, and don't forget the random raid drops. 

 And sometimes a few of the corpses randomly GY right away.
