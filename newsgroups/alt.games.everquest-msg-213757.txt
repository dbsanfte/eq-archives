My Pally is finally getting up to the level where I think I want to start this
quest.  I'm wondering if anyone knows of any specific difficulties that someone
who is KOS in Freeport will have.  I think I can probably do the part where you
give the droms champagne to Tykar Renlin in East Freeport by using the tunnel
to get to the bar but I've never been to the Arena in Freeport where Zimel is. 
Can you get there if you're KOS?  Do you have to use the tunnels or do you have
to get an invis or something?  Anyone done the quest recently that can give any
tips would be appreciated.  TIA.
