Equipped with a bloodstained fang (9/32) I'm doing a max backstab
of 55... and oddly have seen that max backstab climb in sync
with my backstab skill; I didn't notice this till I hit skill 53, but
since then my max BS has been exactly my BS skill.

Perhaps the potential BS off the weapon is higher but the
damage is capped out at skill at my level.  More likely this
is just a fluke, though, as reported BS damage at high levels
is -far- in excess of any potential skill level.
