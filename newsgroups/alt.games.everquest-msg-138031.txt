 Someone mentioned /loadskin <name> 1 preserves your settings. I haven't
tried it myself yet though.

 Oh. Never noticed really!

 Presently still looking. I haven't found one yet so I'm still using the
default one.

 The new UI was close to getting /hitsmode but wasn't quite there. You
could have your hits in one window and mob hits in another. In addition,
they scrolled off eventually so you'd be left with a nice clean
interface 30 seconds after a fight. Plus, enrage and such went to the
main window. The old /hitsmode wasn't quite there either because misses
still went to main chat.

 The latest patch pretty much gets me everything I wanted other than
having to leave windows up with text in them that never scrolls off.
Sure, I have it set to fade but it's still there.

 With the last patch I now have Enrage in main chat. I wish I could send
faction elsewhere but I think that falls under 'Other' and some 'other'
messages I actually like seeing in main window.

 Just about. Need to find root and I'll be set.
