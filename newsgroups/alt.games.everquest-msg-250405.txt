Thanks, great set of tips. With reference to the above, I am trying to work
out the pro's and con's of the main tank acting as puller:

1. MT pulls the mobs: The mob(s) aggro him/her initially without involving
other characters. This is ideal except that I would imagine that there would
be a significant HP loss to the MT during the pull with little damage
return. Since the MT job is to take damage whilst allowing others to inflict
it would this not minimise the effectiveness of the MT (whos primary
function is to have high HP)? In case of an overpull the mobs will all aggro
the MT and (hopefully) the worst case scenario would be the loss of the MT.

2. Seperate MT and puller: The full effectiveness of the MT is realised but
if the MT cant take and/or hold the aggro other characters will be targeted
making life difficult for healers. Furthermore, if there is an overpull the
MT may well be unable to take aggro from all mobs leading to loss of puller
and then indiscriminate targetting of the mobs to the group leading to the
possibility of the group being wiped.

I appreciate that there are other considerations such as method of pulling,
crowd control, dot usage etc to take into account but I would be interetsted
to hear how groups deal with this question in situations such as outdoor
groups, dungeon groups, LDON's and raids. Hope I have explained this well
enough for you to figure what Im getting at. :)
