At 14, particularly if you have a cleric healing you, head over to the
wisp island in Eruds crossing and kill wisps.  Lots and lots of wisps.
They drop decent coin (high end: 1.5 plat per kill) and they also drop
lightstones and Greater Lightstones.  Sell the regular lightstones and
load up on GLS.  As soon as you can carry no more GLS, head over to
the gypsy camp in North Karana and hand in (don't sell) the GLS to the
gypsy that sells the bags (I forget her name).  You get some decent
exp and a small container that you can sell to her for upwards of 9pp
each, depending on faction.

This is how my ranger made it to 18, btw.  Can't beat the cash AND
exp.
