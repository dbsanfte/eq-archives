ok here it is . Druids suffer from two problems. They are the worst class
bar none to bring on a raid. They are a priest class and as such should have
a healing capability somewhere between 50-80% of a clerics.

Some people claim that it should be this way since druids are such good
soloers. My response is that the game is based on grouping and soloing is
thus completely unimportant. I also point out that while druids are fine
soloers , most every one else is to.

Some people claim that adding reasonable healing to the druid class will
destroy clerics. This is ridiculous and ANYTHING that can reduce the need
for clerics is a good thing. A 36 man raid should not be optimum with 6-9
clerics if there are 15 classes.

The clerics also have the loudest lobby by far since game mechanics hace
spawned 1 cleric for every 6 people playing and include all the people so
lame that they can not play anything else while retaining a seat at the
grouping table.
