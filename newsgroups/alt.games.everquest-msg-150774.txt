Yep, this is the case, as explained above why. The newer entries obviously
replace the old ones. If you can get back to the PC once in a while hit End
Trader and the Begin to re introduce your wares.
I was a bit peeved when I realised that this happened but, as also said,
it's no great loss, if someone really wants your wares they will find them.

Another complaint I saw yesterday was of people standing in front of you,
under the canopies..this is because people think they are just browsed like
NPC merchants...I very much doubt anyone will do that to the 150 or so
traders that inhabit the Canopies closest to the Banks, all sitting on top
of one another.
I always move further to the back when trading and when buying have yet to
NOT find a seller...I'd rather they were at the back in the emptier areas,
it's easier to spot them there.
