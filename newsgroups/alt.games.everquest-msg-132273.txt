Dunno about central.  It's more like 'a really good and interesting 
example', near as I can tell.

}Gardner in Wicca.

I've heard a good number of Wiccans suggest that Gardner didn't have a 
blinking clue, a few froth at the mouth in drooling adoration, and a few 
say 'who?'.  I'd hardly say he's necessary to Wicca.  It's about like 
talking about Falwell's role in Christianity...

Many are.  Many non-Wiccans are also familiar with it.  If you were gonna 
associate it with a particular group, and didn't want to choose Jewish 
Mystics for some reason, I'd probably suggest Ordo Templi Orientis.

I think it's more like 'You dont have to know the significance of the 23rd 
Psalm to be a Christian.'
