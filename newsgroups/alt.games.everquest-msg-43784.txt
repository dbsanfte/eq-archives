Try an old 486 with Firewall on a Floppy. about $10 to whack together
off of a pile of auction parts, runs flawlessly. 

 For another, I am running BeOS on a P200 with 48Mb RAM and a firewall
for that OS. That one runs better than flawless, it is mostly
invisible.

And, I was able to build a nice P133 that I popped DOS 6.2 on from the
leftover parts. I can play my old games again without playing stupid
.pif games in windows!
