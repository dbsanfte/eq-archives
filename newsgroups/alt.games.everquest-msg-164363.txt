Hi everyone:

Well, I'm about to let my secret out of the bag! I collect robes and so far
have eleven in my collection, spanning for the very lowbie type robe to a
couple of half decent ones. I'm a level 60 Wizard, and for my general
everyday hunting I wear my Dream Weaver Robe - And I have a Shiny Robe of
the Underfoot Robe for raiding - not that great of a robe, but it has 10
resists to fire, cold and magic.

My question is - excluding no-drop robes, what would be a good robe for me
to look out for to replace my Underfoot Robe. I don't have bundles of cash
to spend, but resists are kinda important to me. I'm on the Stormhammer
server, and am looking to upgrade via the Bazaar and the traders that are
there. BTW, I'm not interested in INT as the main stat, just resists, though
if INT is on the robe too, more the better.

Kind regards to you all ..

Stevie.
