Ahh I remember getting in a group in one of the low PoP zones. Just a 
little level 53 ench. They pull, I tash, I slow, I get chewed out.

Seems they didn't want me slowing, it hurts their DPS. O_o

The problem we had with that little group was any time anyone but the 
tank got agro, they became a smear on the wall.

After getting chewed on again for slowing my mez targets (because I 
don't want the downtime of a rebuffing session after my rez) they kicked 
me when I asked if I should be charming the pulls and hasting them, then 
breaking charm, to add DPS to the group.
