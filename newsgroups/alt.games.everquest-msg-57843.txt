As you've probably read, I am unable to see your posts for reasons
that escape me. You're not in my kill file, so I assume that either
Agent is playing games with me, or our news providers are feuding.

Anyhow...

Some things related to the FAQ. First, I offer this for inclusion,
since it seems to come up every now and again:

"The entire EverQuest (EQ) universe (at present, 40 separate worlds)
is run on approximately 1,000 servers. These are located in our onsite
datacenter and at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego, less than a mile from
our offices). The mix is about 60/40 (here vs. AT&T CERFnet)."

Quote from interview at www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest.html of
Adam Joffe and Scott McDaniel, both of SOE.



Also, from what I can see when people quote parts of the FAQ, the
address for my tailoring guide is out of date. The correct address is
below.

Thanks!
