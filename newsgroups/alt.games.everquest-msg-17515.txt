This seems to be something else that is not covered in the manuaal, at
least I have`nt found it.

When I was having a big lag on the updating of the text window that
made the game unplayable I was told as long as the bar underneath the
figures was green it was`nt a connection problem. I do`nt think that
was quite true because my ISP found a defective splitter on my cable
modem setup where the fibreoptic cable was split between the TV and
the modem..   
Anyway what I wanted to ask is is there anywhere, on a site perhaps!,
I can find a good explation of those figures!?
