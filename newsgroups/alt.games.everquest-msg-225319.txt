Well, the suits of armor, some can be rooted, some can't.  I have not 
noticed any visual difference between the ones that can and the ones that 
can't.  I do admit I did not pay a lot of attention to the names, I was 
soloing at the time, and basically came to the conclusion that I could do 
better elsewhere for solo xp.
