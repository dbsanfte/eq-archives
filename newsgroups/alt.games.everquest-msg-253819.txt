I do drive a motorcycle but weather stops me about 1/3 of the time and
seasons change and I can't bring myself to ride around at 65 MPH on the
freeway with just a coat between me and the air in the middle of winter.
BTW, most bikes I know of don't come anywhere near 0-60 in 3 seconds.  Dodge
has a concept bike with a Viper motor and that only does 0 - 60 in 2.3
seconds.  My bike is a lowly Nighthawk 750 :(  I can't afford a 0 - 60 in
2.8 second Hayabusa atm, someday though ;p
