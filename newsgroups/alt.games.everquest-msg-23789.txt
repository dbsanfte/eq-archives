Along the wall from Kael to Skyshrine, there will be two named giants.
One is called Toxi-something and Tombkeeper something.  They will have
with them four storm giant escorts who are actually on kromrif faction
rather than kromzek.

The two named see invis and at least one can harm touch.

Harm touch, darkness, fear and a couple of poison dots.  I can
garantee you if the druid doesn't have a buttload of buffs he will be
running back naked to his corpse (in this case, waiting on some necro
to SC it).

At level 60, with symbol or marzin and a couple of left over shaman
buffs, I managed to out "run" them with less than 2 bubbles of health.
That's going from over 3400hps to less than 1300hps.  Those giants
managed to remove 2100hps from me before I could type "/gu Oh shit!".

Remember, unlike PCs, NPCs once they start casting their spells, you
can't out run that cast.
