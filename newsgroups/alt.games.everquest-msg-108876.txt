Note the 'blueyonder.co.uk' in the addy...
and the fact he mentions 'Gold Edition'...

He's a Brit (which means there's no 'jewel case' edition for sale')

There IS the Kunark/Classic edition available on the Ubi Soft budget label
(boxed, not jewel case)... �9.99... OR...
You can get the GE (Kunark/Classic + Velious + Luclin + mousemat + map +
cover art posters) for �29.99

My advice... buy the Gold Edition... you'll want Velious + Luclin eventually
anyway :o)
