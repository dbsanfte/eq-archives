As far as I know, the damage bonus is derived by the level of the character 
wielding it ( the formula for 1-handers was listed yesterday in a post, 
search google for damage bonus ) and the type of weapon you are wielding ( 
1-handed, 2-handed ).

A level 65 would see a different damage bonus than a level 45 for the same 
weapon.
