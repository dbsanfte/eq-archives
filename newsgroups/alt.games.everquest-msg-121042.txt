It seems to me that some of the focus types were put onto
easy-to-get items because Verant felt that those spellcasting
areas were already underpowered across the board and needed
a boost that every spellcaster could acquire, whereas others
were already pretty much balanced and should only be
able to be upgraded through raid-level encounters.

Examples:

   Extended Range III on Cougar Claw Earrings:  Apparently
   Verant felt that a larger range on all spells was
   something that should be within the reach of all
   casters.

   Improved Healing III only on rare "uber" items:
   Apparently Verant felt that levels of healing for
   45+ spells were already in line with where they
   should be, and only an elite subset of high-end 
   players should be able to boost their healing ability.

(On the other hand the most recent patch message implies that
some items had the wrong effect attached to them, so we'll
see how it shakes out after the systems come back up.)
