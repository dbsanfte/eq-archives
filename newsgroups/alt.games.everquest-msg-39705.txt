I wish we rogues could do that, too.  (As do bards for hot-swapping, or
'juggling', their instruments between songs).
Easiest way is to make a hotkey of your Primary and one of a main inventory
slot.  Once the fight starts, pick up the Inv weapon and hold it over your
Primary.  When Backstab key clears, click once to switch them, BS, and
re-click to go back to your other weapon.  Fight's over?  Put your weapon
back in Inv.

HOWEVER, I've been following the topic in different places and I've never
seen it proven that juggling will really help your overall damage.  The
weapon delay on the high-dmg stabber WILL come into play somewhere so the
common concensus is that it's really not worth the efforts.
