I used to go find a low level untwinked chanter (as much as i hate 
people doing a /who DRUID for me, i did a /who ENCHANTER to find them), 
and offer 2pp pr cast if i supply the materials. If they didnt have the 
spell we would go to LFay and i would pay for the spell.

Usually did 2 stacks at a time, taths 80pp in a few hours, a normal 
level 12 chanter cant get close to making that amouth in that time.
