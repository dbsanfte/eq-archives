	Well, gee, if they have friends they don't NEED to solo.  2 level
80 friends could PL you to 75 in 3 days (maybe).  I really see this
particular change aimed at the same class of "new" players who beg
for stuff in the bazaar or send random tells asking you to PL them.

	The unlocked zones is good, I think, since it lets people who've
soloed a necro to 80 and 600 AA's over a couple of years get a look at
the rest of the world.  Granting new characters a bye for 25 levels is
simply a mob too far IMHO.

	Well, yeah, I wish they could just make the lower levels more
fun so people would WANT to start new chars.  There's no longer any
possibility of childhood on EQ and that sucks.

	And a lot of the changes they make are "yeah, well, ok, no more
game until 75" rather than "let's make level 20 fun again!".

	I'll play as long as the servers are up.  I just like to kite
I guess.  Never got much out of that whole group thing except complaints
about drawing aggro.
