There is a quest in Halas for a neck piece that summons a hammer.  The
summoned hammer is a light source as I recall.

There is a caster beads quest given in the shaman guild that nets you
a hammer, but the drop is extremely rare and the goblins are extremely
green to you.  Also the summoned hammer I mentioned previously has a
better ratio.

You could auction that you are looking for a 1HB or Piercer that a
shaman can use.  Velium weapons are probably the cheapest magical you
could buy; they may cost a ton from an npc merchant but players will
sell them for 6 platinum or so. Other players may have better items
they are ready to part with cheaply.  You seem interested in 1HBlunt,
but you could get a piercing weapon.  As for a 1HB, the Velium Etched
Stone Mace drops in Great Divide and is lore, so it is often sold
cheaply for a fast sale when someone is huting the Tizmaks there.
Wraithbone Hammer drops in City of Mist and is so common it sells
cheaply too.  At 21 you might be able to hunt cougars in Ice Clad; you
can start getting the cougar bone from Midnight for the Garou Bone
Club quest.
