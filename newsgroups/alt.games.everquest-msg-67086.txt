This is often the problem if people level really fast they end up down on
equipment.
Oh I know what you mean about never winning rolls, have a guild mate who has
the same problem.

People have no right to complain about your equipment if you can get the job
done. Is it your armour or weapons they have a problem with?
If it's your armour are you in full crafted and are you wasting any other
slots that could be better (shoulders, fingers, neck, ears..wrists, even)
maybe post what you have and see what ppl suggest.

Can't help you with money, to equip myself I used to hunt (low 20's to low
30's) all the camps of bandits on the QH side of West Karana, could make
150 - 200pp in a couple of hour, from there I went and used money gained in
trading, few lucky/smart deals and you've got a couple of K to play with.
For the level of equipment you are looking at this will NOT be enough and as
a warrior you're not going to be solo'ing Hill Giants.
Can't really help you there I'm afraid even lower level mobs that drop nice
items (alchemist in Perma or lord picklaw in Runnyeye) will wear you down
and eventually kill you.

Are you not in a guild for any particular reason? Many guilds will make a
point of equiping their members that is not to say with gifts but helping
the character get his items him/her self.
There are 2 types of guilds, the Uber ones and the rest of us. Just because
we don't go waking the sleeper doesn't mean we don't achieve our own small
victories and, more importantly, have fun.
