Heh - there's a reason my alt BL just became my main

At 58 I already do better DPS than my mage did at 58.

In one more level I can provide 7 mana/hp per tick to the 
group (and myself).  My mage could provide 7mana per tick
to anyone who asked - at a cost of HP and 320 mana per 
person every 15 minutes.

Slow - no contest

Haste - no contest

Utility - At least as much as a mage.

Pet heals - I now have a 300mana/1250 heal with no recast
time on my BL.  My mage used a spectral parchment to get a
300mana/1200 heal with an exhorbitant recast.  If I want to
chain it with something I can spend another 5k on TER for
a 400mana/900hp heal.  At 61 I'll have a 425mana/2100pt heal 
with no recast from an ethereal parchment.

Pet Procs - no contest.

Heals - no contest

Survivability - no contest.  Heck, I took 9 or so seconds to
go down the other day against a boss mob during a wipe - thank
you Protective Spirit.

HP buffs with +atk.  (by 62 it's +625 HP, and +45sta)

Savagery/Ferocity for boss fights - very cool

More good AA's than I know what to do with:

The list goes on.  This would be a "Grass is greener post"
except I've tasted the grass over here, and it does taste
better.
