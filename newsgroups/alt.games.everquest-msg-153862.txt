Ssshhh! Don't encourage the luddites ; )

Seriosly - it is just another networking solution, an ideal one for the
small office, small business and a large and/or tech savvy family, not too
mention the tech savvy individual who likes to keep a lid on his/her stress
levels.

Oh - it's also ideal for playing games and downloading porn but then again
roads are good methods for transporting drugs and getting to weekend holiday
destinations, but that hardly makes them an evil concept either.
