I've given up on feerott. LQ rockhopper hides are dime a dozen (7pp each on
rodcet nife in bazaar right now, lq cat is 9) and xakra silks work with them
fine, and drop in abundance.

Feerott was awesome about 6 months ago. I'd go with my pet and have a ball.
People often sold the silks to vendors too, and i'd buy stacks and sell them
in the bazaar, or make padding and sell that too. Padding's really
oversupplied on rodcet now tho; was 70 pp each, now as low as 30. Good for
smiths i suppose.  I got to 180 something on plate but my smith skills has
gotten really stuck; the temper for acrylia is a nightmare costwise (current
price 550 each!), for making something i just end up selling back to
vendors. Tailoring and pottery and brewing are all much easier. Pottery goes
to 199 on store bought items! Pity ceramic linings aren't stackable unfired.

I did the shadowscream armor quest and got the items needed to make it but
the drop rate for it's components seems to be awful, unless you are a bard
pulling the contents of the zone, like i've seen a few times in hollowshade
moor. At least they aren't no rent etc now.
