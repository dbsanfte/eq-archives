Richard, 

For a significant fraction of it's player base, Everquest succeeds 
because it supports a feeling of accomplishment and self-worth through 
forced interaction.  In short, somebody that is immature or just plain 
young (after all it is indeed just a game and most of the players are 
going to be young) can feel superior because of his Uberness.  And how do 
you prove your Uberness?  By your gear, which means you have to raid if 
this is what your ego craves and what you and/or your guild can kill.  It 
is hardly suppressing that guilds with people devoted to the single 
minded pursuit of demonstrating their superiority by accomplishing the 
next artificial goal handed them will have an high percentage of people 
with no social skills and completely lacking a sense of perspective.  The 
wonder is not that there are so many people to avoid but that there are 
so many that are even more who are fun to group with and talk to. Some of 
the most fun I've had in the game has been grouping with (I hate raiding, 
it feels just like working) people who are literally decades younger than 
me.  And of course every once in a while I group with someone who is 
basically a good guy but just needs to mature or grow-up a little bit. 

This newsgroup is a great example of that.  This is the only newsgroup I 
lurk or post on that I have kill filed people on temporarily.  In every 
other group the assholes can be counted on to stay assholes and never 
contribute in a meaningful fashion.  Here there are several posters who 
can give good advice that every once in a while just seem to suffer 
meltdown. 

Middle-aged analysis from someone who is older than you and is one of 
those supervisors you talked about (Manager at an aerospace company in 
CT)
