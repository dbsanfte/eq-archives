What gets me about the mage epic is that, not only is it
intentionally bottlenecked in Hate, to limit the number
of epics that enter the game, but when asked about caster
balance, VI immediately trots out, "mages with epic are
overpowered for solo play."  !?!

So, we've massively bottlenecked your epic, to the point
where most of you will never see it, and we're using it
as a yardstick to gauge your class's balance  :-/
