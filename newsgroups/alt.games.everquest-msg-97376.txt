Hmm, boring and tedious, good words to describe a game?  And show
me where my mage has more power than a melee in the current game,
please, I'd love to see it. 

(actually, if those focus summons go live, don't, I think that
is pretty closed to balanced.  But in terms of raw damage over
time (mages are an offensive class) monks and rogues and rangers
own me at 51.)

Hmm, if you were finding safe places to med up, then you weren't 
grouped.  Therefore you missed out on the biggest problem with the
spellbook - It cuts you off from the combat your group is in.  It
delays developement of important group skills casters (especially
pet classes) need to learn.  Pet control is more than a LITTLE
difficult if you can't see where it is, where the adds are, and
see the problem the 'chanter is having mezzing due to it.  All you
see in the window is the message that your pet it hitting "An Orc
Warrior"  WHICH "An Orc Warrior" of the 3 in camp is he hitting?

Yep, in your own words, it takes tedium and boredom away.
