No, I never suggested anywhere near that high. I think a warior in LDON gear 
(or top level bazaar gear) and 50 aa could get a group *very* easily. 
Anything below that.... hmmm well it might depend on how good the cleric is. 
Gear is only part of it tho... aa's are perhaps more important for tank 
survivability.
