An account key is only good for making one account. After that, the
key is useless. Since he clearly used it to make an account, the only
option without buying a new copy would be for him to give you his
account login info and let you change the billing over to a card of
your own. (Drawback to this: As the original account owner, he can
write an email to SOE saying the account was stolen and get the
password reset so he can take it back without you having any say at
any time. But, if he's a friend, that's probably not a worry)
