}62+ mages can summon a Talisman of Return (if they have the spell) which is
}a right-click gate, but they're not very good. To cast the gate requires a
}alchemy made component, that costs about 100pp. The gate takes a long time

}chances of finding a mage to summon you the item, and a shaman to make you
}the component, is much less than the chance of finding a wizard to TL you...

I suspect he's referring to this quest:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2202

For this item:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16558

There are at least two sequel quests to this, resulting in a neck with 
unlimited charges of Talisman gate and fairly uber stats: 15 str, sta wis, 
int, agi, 15 to all resists, and 75 HP, mana. *drool* :)

Rumor has it that the need for alchemy component has been removed, at least 
for the effect on this item, I don't know about the mage item, but it's the 
same effect.  lucy does list it as requiring the reagent, though, so who 
knows.
