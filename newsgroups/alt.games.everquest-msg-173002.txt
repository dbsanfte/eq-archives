54 enchanter here with 250 jc., I don't have c3 yet.  I can still make
money on many items, with imbued solsek ro rings being the best (you
need a wizard friend for this though).  Most of the veils sell for
>less< than they can be made for (on brell at least) after you consider the 5% always chance of failure added to cost.  Most of my carreer I lost money on jc.  When the bazaar first started I made back what I'd lost and then some.  But it's to the point I can probably make as much (a lot more if I get lucky and catch a rare spawn) just killing crapy loot mobs in The Grey.
