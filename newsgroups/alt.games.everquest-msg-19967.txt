They should have seen this problem coming long time ago.
With making Karana a neutral god instead of a good one, they put the Good
team in a very bad situation.  By giving the Evil Team five uncontested
starting cities, while making Good and Neutral have to fight eachother for
control of their cities, that made things even worse.

Things are tough for the Neutral team right now, in that they're fighting a
mulit-front war, being cut in half (with Evil controlling FP) and squeezed
from all sides by both the Good and Evil teams.

Good Team on Sullon Zek currently has five zones:  the two High Elf city
zones, GFay, Crushbone, and Everfrost (and their hold on EF is questionable
sometimes).  As the Evil team grows in power unmolested and mostly
unchallenged, the Neutral team insists on extinguishing all traces of the
Good team off of Antonica.  The Neuts (at least on Antonica) scream, "three
team server... no alliances!".... yet if the Newts continue to persecute the
Good team out of existence, then guess what... you've got a two team server
anyway.

The /motd a few days back said 'the Nameless is considering some hefty
penalties for the Evil Team to create a ballance among worshippers.'  It
would take some whopping penalties to have that make a difference at this
point.

And if they do that, they probably need to give some whopping bonuses to
members of the Good Team to entice them to keep up the struggle against such
odds.

The only solution I see right now is to merge the Good and Neutral teams.
Even then, Evil has a big advantage at the moment.  If Verant doesn't merge
Good and Neutral, then Good and Neutral guilds will have to learn to work
together and sign peace treaties, or both will be overrun by the Evil team.
