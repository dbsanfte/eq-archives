    That should make the run to Akheva a bit safer, anyways!

    BOOOOOOOOOO nerf! It was awesome having Feign Death on my enchanter! For
those scratching their heads: when they patched in the "pets won't attack
mezzed mobs" thing, it changed it so mobs in general wouldn't attack a
mezzed target. So enchanters could mez themselves to stop from being
attacked. Not only that, but being mezzed completely wiped the enchanter off
the hate list of all mobs. It was fun while it lasted - now I have to keep
that AoE mez memmed. =)

    They said they'd done this before - I hope it's finally been done. It's
damn-near impossible to power up pottery with clay unstackable.

    Couldn't you purchase more ore by simply selling the fine steel weapon
to a vendor then using the cash to buy ore? Or do you really get that much
ore?
