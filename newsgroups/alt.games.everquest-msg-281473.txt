Pull with an arrow, it's easier.

What the warrior needs to do is,

1. tag with an arrow before the mob's in camp
2. engage with weapons before anything else
3. taunt once
4. use their best hate disc (incite or whatever)

Even with snare on the mob, that will almost always get aggro if the puller
knows what their job is - which is to get the mob to the warrior's feet and
stand until it's on the tank not them.

It's vital to tag and do some damage before using the hate disc, because
the raw hate from your first action to get onto the hate list is capped.

Pullers have a hate bonus from being the first one to get onto the hate
list, so you have to get over that.

I prefer my pullers not to 'jolt', because when the taunt does land, I then
have an aggro boost over the rest of the group.  However, pullers need to
adapt, and if the tank is struggling for aggro, they should consider using
jolt and not pulling with snare (an arrow is enough).

The risk with jolt is that it lowers the puller's hate and the next person
on the list is .... the cleric.
