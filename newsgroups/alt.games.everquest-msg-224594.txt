Unless I'm dyslexic (which is not out of the question), that should read 320
mana.  I was using that spell with my necro today.  Your point still stands
though, as it's probably the fastest-working DOT at only 42 seconds and the
one I use most often when grouped.  The extra mana doesn't mean as much to a
shaman or necro as it might to some other classes.

BTW, speaking of DOTs, if you know someone who is not kos to the giants in
Kael, you can look into getting a Coldain Military Wristguard, which has
decent stats for a shaman but more importantly Burning Affliction 3.  The
quest isn't difficult nor terribly time-consuming (I did it for two
different characters in a couple of hours) assuming you have someone who
isn't KOS.  I think Lenny might fit the bill, being an ogre.  Something to
look into, anyway.
