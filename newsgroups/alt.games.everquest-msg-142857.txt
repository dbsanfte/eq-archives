Really?  Well sneak is hardly crucial, although its handy to be
able to use vendors pretty much at a whim.  Since only rogues
can really "hide and sneak" even if other classes get both
skills due to class/race combo, the ability to move around with
real invis only exists for them.  Hide, though, is a solo and AFK
cleric's best friend... Kaladim and gate back costs me about 30
seconds per mob of med time... on the other hand, Hide capped
at 50 isn't really much better, since you have to activate it about
three times on average to get it working.
