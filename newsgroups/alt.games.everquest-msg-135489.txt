Yeah, but the only difference between ToV and Ssra is a minor addendum...an
"oh yeah, btw, remember you gotta do this one thing for this critter."  If
90%+ of a raid is the same, I consider it the same, and there's very little
difference between that and Vox except levels.

Yup, my brother's a 60 cleric good only for xp groups...learned what a CH
chain was about a month ago.  I've had countless tells of "I know he's your
brother but...." :p
