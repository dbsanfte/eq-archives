I get that. I really do. But it has to be balanced. As long as EQ has 
'the easy way' (static zone-in camps, or maybe a cleric rez-bot, or 
stuff like PC, OT, and BoT) it undermines the the 'having fun' or 'being 
addicted' that comes from beating a tough encounter.

I banged my lvl 52 sk's poor head against HS last week in a 3 man group 
of similiar level players. It was great fun. I died many times. But we 
took out every named we saw, and had a blast beating the various wings. 
(Except east... we couldn't quite crack east... yet) In 4 days I 
couldn't convince a single other person in our level range in either of 
the 2 guilds represented by our little 3 man crew to show the slighest 
interest in coming out. They went to Greigs End or POI.

A guildie in the same period of time gained 6 levels (I gained 2 
yellows) in some PoP PL group he was in. His lifebar never dropped below 
90% and his mana never fell below 80%.

I'm sure I had more fun than he did, but I've got a lot less to show for 
it. In EQ the fun way is the least productive way (Indeed if my group 
hadn't included a 90% rezzing cleric I'd have lost 2 levels instead of 
gaining 2 yellows).  Its a bad game design. A death penalty that 
punishes you for doing something risky in a game that allows you to get 
better reward from doing something trivial is counter to any rationale I 
can think of.

The death penalty doesn't make EQ more addicting, because people just go 
where its trivially easy to avoid dying.

VERY FEW people ever go near content that has the possibility of causing 
multiple unrezzed deaths.

EQ would need to be completely revamped to remove trivial & PL content 
in order for its death penalty to make sense. Sure you can argue that 
people are just cheating themselves by powerleveling in trivial places, 
but SOE has to take responsibility for the fact that they've left that 
environment intact. It would be better for the game if they closed those 
loopholes as they were discovered.

But since they haven't done so, preserving the vicious death penalty is 
just an anacronism, one that does nothing more than to further herd 
players into the safest easiest places.

Trouble is: What player is going to be smitten with the addiction after 
defeating a difficult encounter for rusty swords, when its plain as day 
he can do nothing worth mentioning and get much furhter ahead.
