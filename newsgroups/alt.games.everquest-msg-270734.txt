And they're down RIGHT NOW - I CAN'T PLAY OR CODE - DAMN YOU BLIZZARD!!!

- YOU OWE ME ummmm (hmmm, carry the one, divide by 31 ummm - oh, wait,
I'm in the free month still, ummm) nothing?  Rats, can't even complain
about that yet (especially with the 4 free days I get because of the
early server problems)

BTW - Blizz did more than disable some lua functionality that would have
posed security problems -- there are some distinct differences in the
way Lua 5.0 treats this and self and the way Blizzard Lua does.
