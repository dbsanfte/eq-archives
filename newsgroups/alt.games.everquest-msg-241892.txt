Yes. So what? I don't deny its the official source of information. And
if there is some information I need its a place I'd go. However,
putting it on your website is not notifiying your customers.

They also use them announce expansions. fanfaires, and unrelated
titles they also happen to make. Surely a notice that 'sometime in the
next few months we will no longer support directx9' isn't out of line.

That isn't vaporware, that's advising your customers you are on the
verge of substantially changing the minimum system requirements to use
their service!!

The fact that they usually use them for garbage doesn't mean they
don't have legtimate uses. The fact you don't read them is not an
issue. They made sure to put it in front of your face, that's a big
improvement over sticking it in the back of some website you don't
even visit.

Regardless... they still have your address, and could have and should
have sent the message.

The point is that you cannot call posting something on a website that
players really have no reason to go to, adequate 'notification'.
