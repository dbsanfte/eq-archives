  I don't really think anything is wrong with the EQ economy.  Or at
least, nothing is wrong with it that an accurate pricing site would
fix.

  But a pricing site can never hope to truly, on the whole, to be
accurate.  It's not fake price reports that so much cause a problem,
as it is the introduction of new items of comparable power to the game
via content additions, and the fact that more of a given item, and
more platinum, is constantly entering and exiting the game at an
uneven rate... which causes prices to constantly, and sometimes
drastically, to fluctuate.  What sells routinely for 2000pp one month,
a month or two later may be routinely selling for 500pp.  It'd be
impossible for any web site to keep up, not without a large number of
people constantly and immediately posting their prices.

  No web site is ever going to be seen as a pricing authority, no
matter how "accurate" they become, and all major transactions will
continue to take place person-to-person, so the bottom line is always
going to be what the seller is willing to accept, and what the buyer
is willing to pay.  A little bit of "haggling" and a "fair" price will
eventually be met anyway, if the buyer and seller in agreement, so I
don't really see a big need for pricing sites.

  I still use eqprices.com, but not for the pricing aspect.  It's an
easy way to find what gear is available for a given race/class combo
with various attributes.  The pricing is almost always totally off,
but once I learn for an item, it usually isn't that hard to find out
market value by other, more accurate means when I need to.
