Pets under level 14 cannot hit "invulnerable to non magic weapons"
creatures without help.

I think you can give chanter pets mage summoned weapons which would
enable them to hit stuff for you.. but they might not be able to accept them
until levels high enough to make this meaningless.

Don't feel too bad, the Beastlord pet won't accept a weapon at all,
ever, so lowbie beastlords have no Wisp capable pet until 15.. and
Cleric pets are even more useless than yours, just as deaf, won't
take a weapon or buff of any sort, almost no HP at all, and suicical..
not to mention we don't get the spell until level 54.
