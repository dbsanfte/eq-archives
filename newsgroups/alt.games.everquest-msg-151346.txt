I've just looked and found it in the EverQuest directory. Also in Medal of
Honor, Dungeon Siege, JumpGate, Half-Life, and CounterStrike.

And a single search for the file on Google finds a zillion hits, the first
of which is
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?mss32 - from where you can
download it.
