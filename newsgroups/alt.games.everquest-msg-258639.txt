Er, 100% then, since you've already decided to gimp yourself by going
aa rather than level.

Go ahead and get run3 if you need to. Even regen3 or ft3 whichever
necros prefer is okay. If you're doing aa after that rather than
levels, you're basically screwing yourself.

In any event there is no reason to do anything other than all or
nothing.

It is the same exp as L51. Which means at L65 you can get it absurdly
fast, but at L51 you're taking the same amount of time as it took to
regularly level.
