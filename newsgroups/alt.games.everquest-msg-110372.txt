Well, after a fair amount of goofing around, the Chimp is now approaching
his second AA point and hasn't spent the first one yet. The thing that's
stopping him is whether to put it in Regeneration, which is pretty feeble or
go against the grain and put them in First Aid.

Lich is a great downtime reducer when soloing, and eventually being able to
bandage back up to 80% rather than 50% before going back into the fray seems
like a very nice ability.....well on paper that is. Has anyone had any luck
bandaging to counteract Lich or even more importantly - disasters trying?

Regeneration seems to be the obvious choice except 3 hp per tic doesn't add
up to much when you think about it, and Chimp has J-boots so Run isn't that
critical yet.

Thanks in advance for any input ; )
