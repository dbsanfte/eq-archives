The level 4 corpse locating song is your friend - you may not realize
it now, but after level 10 it is going to save your butt a few times :)

At level 10, after you die, you have to go get your stuff off your
body (known as a corpse recovery or CR).
 
One of the important keys to CR is not to try to loot your body
where you died (presumably a dangerous place) but to drag it to a
safe spot to loot.  Make a hotkey that has the command /corpse in
it.  Target your corpse and then run along tapping the /corpse 
hotkey - this will drag your corpse with you to a safe spot.

She wants 4 spiderling silks - you have to either give her 4 at once,
or give her one at a time until you get the trumpet sound and get
some experience (and a reward - a drum you'll like having at 6th level
when you get the percussion skill.

You mean the animated graphic?  It's just the symbol of the bard
class, we all have different ones.  It's just there for looks ;)

Grouping at low levels will help you learn some important group techniques
- one of which is autofollow.  Target your groupmate (you can use the 
f2-f6 keys to target your groupmates) and type /follow.

Basic protocol is to just say thank you - their name is in the healing
message now, so type /ooc thanks soandso for the heal.  Or something
similar.  /OOC is out of character, zonewide broadcast, so if they are
still in zone they will hear you.

Well - certain things are VERY worthwile.  Low end tailoring products
can be sold in the bazaar for pretty decent cash.  Grab a small tailoring
kit.  Combine 2 spiderling silks at a time for silk thread.  At some
point this will give a message that you can no longer get skill by making
these.  Also, when you fight bigger spiders, they drop Spider Silks, 2
of these combined make a silk swatch.  Both of these combines are no
fail combines.  Also, hang onto any wolf/cat/bear pelts you get.  You
combine a silk thread with the low quality pelts to get leather padding
(worth a bunch in the bazaar), use a skinning knife (player made, you
need to look in the bazaar for one) to turn medium quality pelts into
low quality pelts - and make padding.  Sell the High Quality bear pelts
though, people make 10slot backpacks from them.

When you have a bunch of Silk Swatches, paddings and HQ bear skins, you
can set up in the bazaar to sell them.

Whatever you do, try not to get frustrated - this is a HUGE game, and
it's easy to feel overwhelmed.  Just come here, or the bard boards and
ask whatever.  We were all new once, and some of us still remember how
tough that was :)

Oh, BTW - you've picked a class that can be VERY powerful, but is a 
challenge to play well.  My first character was a bard.  Stick with it,
you master the tricks of the trade and you will be in high demand for
groups as you level.
