I can understand your frustration, I play a human cleric who is very slow
and the cross continent runs take forever.  But, I never assume folks who
are in game are there to help me.  If I get a SOW or help when I am dying,
that is GREAT.  But it isn't an entitlement.  My cleric goes anon a good
deal of the time cuz she gets tells asking for buffs and heals all the time.
Ironically, in my plate armor, I get asked for SOW all the time too :)
