An odd stance to take from a  person who wants to make enchanters useless on
raids.  Thier main job at the moment, other than some buffs, is to mana sieve
the mob.  It's one of the only things they actually get to do in combat.  You
wish to take away thier combat role and give it to paladins.  Improve your
class at the expense of another, and to hell with what it does to the
challenge of the upper level game.
