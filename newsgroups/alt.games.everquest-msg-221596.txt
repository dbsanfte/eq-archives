And that is why groups often just give the person doing a tradeskill the 
items that are drop only at least.  For gems, I have never done that, you 
can easilly pick up any gems you need from merchants, but for things like 
the smithing drops, there is no other way to get them other than going to 
an LDoN dungeon, and killing mobs.  Most groups I am in, even pickup 
groups, have no problem with letting a tradeskiller have the tradeskill 
items.
