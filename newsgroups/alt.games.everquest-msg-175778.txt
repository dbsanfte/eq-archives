Well, Mythic has quicker patches and they screw things up a lot less than
SOE, so it clearly is possible to do better than SOE is doing.  And yes,
even if you take into account that EQ has twice as many subscribers and more
servers to patch, Mythic still is faster and less botched than EQ was when
EQ was the size DAoC is now.
