This makes little sense.  What good is a higher wis on the fly?  If you
left your wis shield on and swapped in the.... oh wait, read that backwards,
thats what you mean!

Same thing will happen with Mod Rods, and its worse on clerics;
since we have CHeal, its most efficient to take HP down as low
as possible.  Under 300 hp and a mob shows up guess who
its going to make a beeline for?  In a hot area, I've learned to
say the Brell with efficiency, drop down 600hp, CE, drop
the third rod charge, and get to FM and FHP both at once.  Its
not as astoundingly good as chewing four rods= 12 charges and
then one Cheal, leaving me only 300+ mana down from full and
FHP... but its a darn sight safer.
