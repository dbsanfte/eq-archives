I could go for that...I was thinking about buying the accounts of 
a friend of mine who is quitting just so I know that they won't 
go to ebay players. He doesn't want much if it is me, but he 
could probably get a fair amount if he sold to someone else. I 
would feel strange logging in and seeing his characters and 
knowing it isn't him inside them=\

Knowing that I am not normally one of his classes, I know I 
wouldn't be fool enough to get into groups and screwing up...but 
soloing in them would be fun=) and I might decide I actually like 
playig them, and if I get good enough to play in groups with them=)
