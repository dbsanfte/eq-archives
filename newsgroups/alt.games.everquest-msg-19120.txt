Don't underestimate the human capacity for stupidity.  I had to rescue a
level 25 Barbarian Warrior who was bound in Neriak Commons.  Fortunately,
whoever bound him there at least showed the compassion of binding him on
the bank of the river next to the Priest of Discord.  (On the other hand,
that would have been the only safe place for the Binder to cast spells on
him without getting themselves killed, maybe.  Do Guards consider casting
Bind Affinity to be a "hostile" act?)
