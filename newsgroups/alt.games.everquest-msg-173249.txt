Or if you prefer proof:

Quoted from www.dictionary.com

equate (v):

1. To make equal or equivalent.
2. To reduce to a standard or average; equalize.
3. To consider, treat, or depict as equal or equivalent: "equates
inexperience with youth".

In other words, to equate is to call two things exactly equal.

compare (v):

1. To consider or describe as similar, equal, or analogous; liken.
2. To examine in order to note the similarities or differences of.

In other words, to put two things beside each other and examine how they
match or do not match each other.

Now if you still can't understand the difference between the two terms, feel
free to post here and I'll explain in greater detail while telling you what
a moron you are.
