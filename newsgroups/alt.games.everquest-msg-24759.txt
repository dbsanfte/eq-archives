First let me get this out of the way...

There, now I can get on with my question. =)  A few months ago, I was
playing around with different commands. One of the commands I looked up said
it would toggle on/off certain windows in full screen mode. Well after a bit
of playing around, I found out that I had toggled off my chat window in full
screen mode, and had forgot to set it back to it's origional configuration.
"Ehh, I play in windowed mode anyway, so no biggie..." Since then, I've
thrown away the printed page of commands, and for the life of me I can't
remember the website where I got them.

Lately, I've been wanting to play in full screen mode, but without a chat
window, that would be next to impossible. I've made searches on various EQ
websites for the commands. I've tried the in-game /help command with no
avail. I suppose I could have tried asking a Guide. However, being a guide
myself, I know that very few of them would bother answering my question. And
I have RTFM before anyone asks  =)

So I lay out my question to this newsgroup: Is there an in-game command to
reset the origional full screen configuration? Or is there a way to go into
the EQ source files and change something there?


Thanks in advance
