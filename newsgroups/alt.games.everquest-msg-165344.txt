Yes, but bards really don't need them to be insta-cast.  It's not like we
have to stop to cast them or anything.  Granted, it's more convienant, but
not worth caming the AC for.

I've experienced that problem at 24.  I had to stop using my drum for kiting
in my late-teens.  Now I'm considering trying to slightly encumber myself...
maybe a few rusty longswords, so I can shed them in a hurry if I need to.
