refering to the  Whoot 1 pt less delay a human has than an Iksar at
higher levels

10 - 14 	6 	36 	36 
15 - 19 	7 	36 	36

Yeah, I see it now... Humans are very Uber... they get one less
delay..
hmm... dang no Regen, ahh yeah , no natural AC bonus,  ut... and no
forage..  humans are very UBER...     oh yeah cant swim very well when
young either...

jeez, I feel major suckage that I started an Iksar Monk...  
/em is crest fallen...

heheh  to each his own...  I much prefer an Iksar monk for the reasons
listed.  oh and honestly I use weapons instead of hands... they are
much faster and more damage.

and for RP purposes... Humans, are young in the way's of the monk....
All monkly knowledge came from the masters that were Iksars.
