From Woody's discussion forum: (Posted yesterday morning)

Really? Druids can't use bows? 
That makes no sense to me whatsoever. 
And as far as Capiche goes... **shrugs** I couldn't find how it was
spelled, so I went with what made sense to me. 

Also, keep in mind, the vast majority of the people reading the strip
would have no clue what I was trying to say if it weren't in there
phonetically. **shrugs again and goes to edit out the bow**
