You can go, I went with a 13 Enchanter.  But with all the high levels in the
zone, don't bother for atleast a week.  Not only don't you get the chance to
finish a kill, because everyone jumps in (that is on my server anyway), but
you have to be very careful.  You wouldn't even have to leave the entry
area, there are 6 or 7 that spawn right up front.  Good hunting.
