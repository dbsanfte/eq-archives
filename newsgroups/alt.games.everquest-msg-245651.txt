I really wanted to see the psyclo homeworld explode, and all the aliens, 
and the bank planet and the chinese tiled transfer station and that 
first meeting orchestrated by the chinese hereditary major domo....

they royally screwed b:earth=( they barely followed the plot of the 
first third or so for the movie=(

I wasn't a fan of WWW movie, the show was much better, and I thought 
there was too much funkification of everything. Granted, it was 60fied 
when it was originally on, but still...though the spider animation was 
fun, and I thought Branaugh as the villian was good, he played him well=)
