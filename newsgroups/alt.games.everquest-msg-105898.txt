Try un-rest in DC. its got a whole range for players from Lv16+, but be
warned trains are a very big problem here (as im sure people will agree) you
also get a nice mix of people here to group with. unrest did me good from
Lv17 till 22, jus dont say i didnt warn you, its resident evil out there but
its fun!
