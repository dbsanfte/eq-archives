I know of no post 50 Druid that charges for SoW. Or post 30 or 40 for that
matter. I'm sure there may be some around but, not many I'd wager. There are
just so many other better ways to get plat.  Ditto with porting.

A few weeks back I ported a full group going on a raid from X to Y. Not only
were they a collective royal pain in the ass; it took 15 minutes to gather the
group but, they not once asked *how much*. At the destination there was a flash
disband and they were gone.

This experiment in humility cost me 30 real life minutes. While I probably
would not have asked anything of them, it really *irked* me that they took off
like that with nary a thank you. You know that *magic word like *please*,
*thank you* etc etc?

Now I just put the idiots on ignore, and will ony respond for a CR request.

On the other hand it's a royal pain to relocate a low level character from 
Queynos to BB, and I'll go over that way occasionally, although it takes about
30 - 45 minutes away from my playing time.

BTW Queynos is probably my least favorite zone. It's only reason for existence
to my mind is to transit Black Burrow en route to Permafrost. Other than that
it sucks.  Hopefully the *brains* at EQ will spend some time on it and make it
as interesting as other zones.

Just a small rant.  I've od'ed on EQ and need to give it a rest for a while.
