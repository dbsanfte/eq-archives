Your 15 pet has everything to do with that.  Within a couple levels of
each new BL pet no melee or other hybrid can really compare to a BL for
soloing.

My Troll Shaman stayed bound in PoK and just used SoW to run thru
Misty/Runnyeye/Beholder when hunting NK (used Gate to get out).
Gypsies don't like him, and there's one very annoying guard who
stops by the NK spires periodicly (Frederick?) and Shaman doesn't
get Invis until L29, so the Misty (Rivervale) book worked out best.
