The zones are empty with nobody to interact with *because* of POK and
the introduction of zones so fabulously out of whack in terms of risk
vs reward with everything else that NOBODY makes use of them.

Paludal, POP, Ldon are SO much more rewarding nobody who plays EQ to
progress would make use of them. And this means that the socialites
and explorers also have to make use of them, because there is nobody
to socialise WITH elsewhere, and the friends they make will rapidly
outlevel them.

Crossing dangerous territory, and bumping into peopel for whom the
territory is still dangerous once its trivial for you, was part
of EQ's interaction. You will never come across me in game any more,
I will never get to know you or offer you assitance, because my
territory and yours are massively diverged, locked off by flags
and key requirements, and I no longer traverse your zones to get
to mine - I just click-click and I'm there.

The only time I will ever make contact with you is if you proactively
beg buffs or loot from me... which I despise. I would regularly stop
to help newbies in trouble, get chatting to them, give things away
to the poorly equipped, but now I simply *never see them* in those
situations. That part of the world *does not exist* to me. And my
part does not exist to them. 

It is not that I went seeking these people; I went seeking my friends
and came across them, and thus made new friends many times. Many of
my friends actually, a disproportionate number, ended up being druids
because I was chatty and friendly when I was scrounging a port and
offered them a place in the group subsequently.

This lack of mixing and interaction blows it completely for me - and
I cannot just 'ignore pok' or 'run there' or 'go meet newbies' because
*they no longer exist*. If I run from surefall to lavastorm there is
no point to it; the zones I frequent traverse the plane of tranquility
and the brief LDON teleporter to natimbi and GOD raiding (and instanced)
zones. 

Even were I to go outside my requirements, the other zones would be
empty of people anyway; everyone is crammed into the hyper XP reward
zones of Paludal, POP and the like. LDON and GOD instancing even
means that huge parts of the player base are no longer in the same
world as me or interactable with; they are playing their own isolated
little 6 player diablo's.

Its not ease of transport I object to,its the destruction of the things
that made the world immersive and fostered community and player interaction.

Why? With nobody in them you visit a zone once to see its architecture and
mob models then return... how many times?
