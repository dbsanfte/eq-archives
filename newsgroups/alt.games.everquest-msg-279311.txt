To me grinding means long play sessions just getting experience.
Playing EQ almost became a job rather than a game.  There's no point
to that in WoW because once you are out of blue exp, you slow down.
Might as well either play another char, or actually get a life and
switch off your computer.  Eliminating the feeling of "oh well, guess
I'll put in another 6 hours grinding experience" is a HUGE plus for
WoW.  Or to put it another way, eliminating the feeling of "I don't
want to play, but I HAVE to grind thru this level" is a big plus for
WoW.

The more characters you play, the more you know about the game.
That's a nice effect.  I can read up on a spell line but I really
don't understand a class till I play it.  And it sounds like WoW has
even made warriors interesting, which seems almost impossible.

Well, I suppose if you are truly determined to play full time, you
will.  For me it has a moderating influence.  Except when I came back
from 2 weeks vacation.  Took me a long time to work thru that blue
experience.

Yeah, in the sense that when I played EQ, I normally only did about 3
hours at a time.  It was rare that I played more than 5 hours.   That
being said, enough random people complimented my skill as an enchanter
that I felt I was a pretty reasonable player.  And when I described
being online 3, 4, 5 hours at a time to my non-playing friends, and
then said that I was considered a "casual" player, they were pretty
freaked out.  I think it's safe to say that the "non-casual" player
represents a pretty small fraction of humanity. 

 Are there any stats on how long the "average" EQ player spends online
each day?

Yep, that's a good point.  

I admit, when I first heard about the double experience, I had a
pretty negative reaction, but I'd say that it's a big plus.
