I finally made one today.   Came *very* close several times before that.   Was
hoping for more slots, but it's actually 6 slot 10% weight resist.   Still
very nice for first tier though.   Shortly after getting it, I dinged into
outfitter range, and got my second tier buffs.  Those help a lot, and I expect
more pristines soon.  (unless I move on to tier 2 backpacks.)

It's worse than that.   Not only do you need the recepie for waxed leather,
you also need an ultra rare forage so you have the raw material used to make a
waxed leather plate.    And $20 says by the time you get that, you'll be
making the tier 2 or 3 backpacks, which (I would guess) have better stats than
the "rare" tier one.
