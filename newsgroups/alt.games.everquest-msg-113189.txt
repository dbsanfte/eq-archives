First, let me say, My 55th Druid will SoW anyone who asks. If they are 42nd
or higher, they get SoE (lasts twice as long but is level limited). Now that
I have SoE, I don't keep SoW memmed, so I have to kill it, go to book, mem
it and then cast, not a big deal but just to show I have to do a little
work.

Having said that, I think the reason you were refused and ignored is because
of the abuse druids get daily. I get constant requests for SoW (which I
don't really mind). I also get requests for buffs, heals, ports,
Powerleveling, handouts, and the list goes on and on. Just yesterday someone
came up to me inspected me, asked what my boot were. I told them and then
they said "can I have them?" I thought it was a joke, but when I said no,
the guy threw a fit. Told me I could go get another pair, told me I was
being mean, etc.

With all these requests, some polite, some not, it is easy to get in a bad
mood about spell requests. Then the next unfortunate soul who just wants a
SoW might be getting an earful :(

Wizards get begged for ports, Enchanters get begged for clarity, Shamen get
begged for buffs and SoW, but Druids are unique among all the classes...
Druids have all of the above(except clarity), plus wolfform to pass out and
therefore get hit by the beggars most often. Its easy to get angry about it,
heck I went a week one time saying NO to port and SoW requests, but now I'm
over it.

I pass out SoW everytime, I port when I'm not doing anything, I tell people
"no" to requests I don't want to fill.

Mullo 55 Druid
