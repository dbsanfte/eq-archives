Just wanted to add a suggestion here. As I just made it to 44 my OT days are
still in my memories and I can remember most of it heh :) At level 31 I'm
not sure if this would be a good idea but at about level 35 (least this is
about when I started... :) I started pulling if my mana bar stayed to full.
Nothing keeps a group happier than knowing that while the tanks/melee are
doing thier job dishin out damage the chanter pulls and then mezz's the
add/add's and has next kill ready and lined up to keep the group busy. I've
even got back into the habit in DL now that I'm 44 and can do so reasonably
safe. not sure how many other enchanters do this but I get alot of
complements from my group when I do it. :)

And my chanter is my main... I had a cloth cap until a level 38ish (didn't
realize... repaced it with a Crstaline Silk Cap that took 40 tries to make
heh) And half my Equipment is still raw silk. What I'm suggesting shouldn't
take a twink although that should make life alot easier hehe :)
