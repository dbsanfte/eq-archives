Ungroup & make sure the druid doesnt do more than half damage for better xp.

You always get more xp from a higher mob, but not necessarily a "redcon
bonus" which i believe caps at +2 levels above yours, except in the 50's
where it can go up to 4 levels above yours. My regular group pl'd our pally
tank in POV & he got terrible xp at ~55, 5-7 levels below the mob, but he
did great when we brought him back at 59-60. Faster kills of lower mobs got
him much better xp.
Groupmember's damage output doesnt matter, for xp purposes.

Sit down & make a set of hotkeys for both of em, good hotkeys include:
snare
/pause 3, /assist (name)
/cast x
/g casting snare on %T (or /tell if ungrouped for xp reasons)

heal
/pause 3, /tar (name)
/cast y
/g healing %T

follow
/pause 3, /tar (name)
/follow

Ya, ya you're talking to youself, but that way you hit the hotkey then
switch back to the other box, & you can see that you hit the right key & got
the right target.

Another good one for the druid when hes just assisting the pally would be
/pause 3, /assist (name)
/pet attack (if you like the bear pet)
/pause 50, /cast x(snare)
/pause 60, /cast y(nuke)
/sit

gotta double check for snare resists tho, & modify the pauses to prevent
agro.

btw:
/pause 30, /cast x
means cast spell x then wait 3 seconds, the pause comes after the action,
even tho its written first.

/pause 30 = 3 seconds, /pause 100 = 10 seconds, etc...
