Funny, I was just thinking about all this coming to work this morning. Last
night, a high level druid mentioned something to me about a "JHH" or "JBB"
(I can't remember which). I asked him what that was, and he replied that it
cost about 25k. Ok, but that didn't answer my question...

Is there a website with a glossary of terms, shortforms, etc...? I recently
got back into the game after a lengthy absence, and I don't know what people
are talking about half the time.

Oh, and if anyone on the Vazaelle server has a PGT for sale, can y ou drop
me a line. :)
