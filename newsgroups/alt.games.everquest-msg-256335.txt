KEI (or any variation)
Spirit of Predator (bards ain't melee)
SoW/SoE/FoE/bihli (bards run fast)
Call of Rathe (bards ain't tanks)
Ward of Gallantry (bards ain't tanks)
Spiritual Dominion (assuming it doesn't actually help bards...)

Those are probably the most useless ones for bards that are likely to show
up.  The ones *not* to click off are:

Virtue/symbol, nine, GoD/GMR, brells/sot/vigor, focus, haste of preference.

Hell, those are the only things I wait to get hit by before I jump back in,
and I won't wait on GoD and haste most of the time, but then I'm a puller.
