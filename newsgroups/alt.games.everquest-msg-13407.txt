Yup, when it comes to people trying to be helpful (myself included, NUMEROUS
times) you often have less than 10 seconds to see the problem, analyze the
problem, figure out the best solution based on your current spell icons AND
cast the spell.

So the person didn't actually need help.   So the root actually
inconvenienced the person.  The druid doesn't know that, they're just trying
to keep some stranger alive instead of being branded a dr00d for watching a
player die when they could have done something to prevent it.
