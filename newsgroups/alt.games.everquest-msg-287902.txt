I stopped playing Everquest back in 2007 due to the lack of players on
the AB server, however I have been thinking of taking the leap and
coming back to a game that I used to always enjoy. Here is my problem,
is there a good enough reason to come back (besides just enjoying the
game)?

There are/were some problems with Everquest (which is why I left):

1. Way too many servers - too few people to group with.

2. Pay per expansion costs (having to pay $50 or more anytime an
expansion rolls out, just doesn't fly with me). Been playing EVE
Online since 2007 never having to pay once for an expansion. ** Now I
have not played in a while and this methodology may have changed.

3. Not enough simplified gaming content for people that have to go at
the game solo (especially because of lack of players). Last I checked
I was L80 Paladin and there was not enough quests/general content that
I could solo effectively, but then again since my departure this may
have been addressed already.

These reasons being given - is there any reason why I should go back
to EQ at all?
