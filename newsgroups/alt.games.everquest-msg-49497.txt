I'd rather get please mispelled to pleas or plese than plz, or get it
late, than see plz and u. As a cleric, I tend to add people to the
norezforju list if all I get is a rez plz. My attitude is always if you
cannot make the effort to say please fully, why the fuck should I make
the effort to rez you. Honestly, I don't care if you offer me money. I
either have the time and mana, or I don't.

But this is my opinion, and my own modus operandi. I'm sure there are
other clerics with more tolerant opinions.
