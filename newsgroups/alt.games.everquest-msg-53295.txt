Why do they even allow someone to inspect another in the first place? Why
can't they make it an option like a res or allow someone to say whether they
will allow inspections? If someone wants to inspect me then I can let them
or not let them my choice. All you can see is the graphic in the inspection
window. You can not see the stats. If you say it is for PvP then make it so
on PvP servers or when you go PvP that you have no choice for inspection.

I disagree that it is not a neurotic trait but a matter of privacy and the
invasion of. How would you like it if someone walked up to you and looked at
the label on your jacket or pants. Or looked at the lining of your
underwear. ;) That is what the game is allowing to be done with no say so in
the matter. Granted turning off the inspection messages makes the person
feel better but still. I ask why let people inspect?
