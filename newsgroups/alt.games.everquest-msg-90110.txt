Aloha,
    I thought I'd throw in  my comments under this thread as it seems to be an
appropriate place to vent on this subject. First let me tell you I'm an 'old
guy' and cut my gaming teeth on "Standing Stones" ;  played my first real
military  strategy on a commodore 64. That game was Buntin's "Modem Wars". Late
to the internet I only got on line and '96 but soon discovered Boneyards and
Mplayer where I could play strategy games against human intelligence. My friends
and I used to boast that  "we'd never play a pay for view" what with all the
free gaming sites around. Well, in June of 2,000 I discovered that I would be
'dry docked' for several weeks for a minor operation and decided to try out the
free thirty days on Everquest....needless to say I've been subscribing since.
Oh, and so have a group of my strategy gaming friends who swore they would never
play for fee.
    Because we're a mature player, or maybe we are just missing the 'golfing'
gene, we could afford to put together some fairly herky machines in preparation
for the Lucin upgrade. (Note to others...not having children is a good thing).
In my case I upgraded my machine to a P4 1.8 gig processor and a gig and a half
of ram memory (they want ram memory..Goddamn it I'll show 'em ram memory!!). I
had it mounted on a intel desktop board (D845WN) with an integrated sound chip.
I had been running Sound Blaster but was never really happy with it and since
I'd be using XP professional as my operating system,  I didn't want deal with
Sound Blasters  problems on  XP. Even though it was less than a year old I
upgraded my ATI card to the recommended 8500 and Everquests recommended driver
for that card. My connection was the only thing that wasn't change. I have a
dedicated computer phone line and DSL.
    We all know that Sony or Verant can't configure and test for every piece of
hardware out there, you have to hope they can atleast test their game against
two or three of the biggys. It was with that understanding that I tried to stay
as close to spec as I could afford (there must have been a reason for them to
push DX8.1 - right?).
    To say I'm disappointed with the Everquest team is an understatement. When I
first log on to the game I have to 'cycle' through F10 because the main window
is grayed out. When I zone, I get the 'floaters' and everything moves slowly
until I 'cycle' with the 'persona' button. Even with many of  the graphic
enhancements turned off, the game still chokes a certain points. Usually in high
traffic areas. But the worst effect is the intermittent crashes that have
occurred in and around Freeport (usually associated with zoning) and bounced me
past the desktop into the black screen of death. - redvet, who plays 'Akamai',
