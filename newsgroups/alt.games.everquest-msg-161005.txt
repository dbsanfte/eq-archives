Hmm... a question arises (yeah im full of em lately).  Ok as I
understand most people recommend to get to 55 plus before you start
your AA exp.  because you can kill higher monsters and get better AA
exp since it goes at the rate of 51 or so (again this is as I
understand)...   now the question (yeah about time)...  
Now our buddie of Brell who is 62 goes and kills greens in Velks...
does he get NO exp in AA for them if he has his AA slider set to 100%?
or does he get exp like a leve 51 still for that exp?
now if he gets no exp... would it be smarter to do a standoff when at
60 and set slider to 100 and well, Farm AA exp?

thanks for your time.
