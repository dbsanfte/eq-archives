Did you even bothered to read the damn post you're responding to?
They are mid 50's.  My advice to them was to get to level 65 as fast
as possible instead because 4 groups of mid 50's would be just doing
corpse recovery in ToVN, EVEN with PoP gear (most of which they can't
even fucking equip)!

>Anyway agro control only needs one person cured, not the whole raid

Right because making sure your main tank is cured 100% is drop dead
easy....

Go back and read the post skippy.
They are four groups of mid 50's, the highest level tank being a
"level 60 sk".

That's not tanking.
That's draining mana from your heal chain.  Any fuckwit can do this
for a few rounds.  The problem comes up with Aary's mega debuff which
makes your DPS go through the toliet making that kill last several
minutes which means unless you have 23 clerics and 1 bard (remember,
four groups?), you ain't keeping that "tank" bathe in complete heals.
Sure as fuck that bard ain't hold aggro enough to keep those clerics
from being eaten.

Depends on the druid and depends on the gear doesn't it?  Whereas you
specifically stated a *naked* level 60 bard.

Our guild druids have damn near 8000hps fully buffed.  They can tank
Luclin stuff without too much difficulty.  Now having them hold aggro
is trickier.

Funny idea of tanking.
Me, I don't consider having a zerg force of clerics draining their
mana as "tanking".  I guess it's different for you.
