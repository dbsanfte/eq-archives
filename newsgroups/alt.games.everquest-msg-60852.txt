I can't see how that would work.

1) If it's worth doing it's worth abusing (power levelling).

2) If i'm a non-PL low level I *really* need the cash.

3) If i've got absolute top of the line items and mountains of
money I probably am close to 60th. At which point the amount of
experience generated, and needed, is going to be immense.

However your system could work, and does, as quests. Just have
quests that consume items and money but generate XP. And the time
taken to do the quest should be enough to make PL'ing a pain.

But I still don't see it as a problem. Having durable items and
lots of money sloshing around the system is good. It reduces the
interest in pathetic things like item and loot farming and makes
generosity more likely for all but the very top-end items. 

At the end of the day real economics is neither fun nor heroic.
