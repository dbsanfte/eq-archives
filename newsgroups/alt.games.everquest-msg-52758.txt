But to that I have to say "so?"

Big deal.  Being hit on the head with a hammer every hour is MUCH preferable
than being hit on the head with a hammer every minute.

But that don't make it "better."

<smile>

DAOC is still in beta.  It's true.  Your ass-kissing opinion <smile> isn't
going to make it any less true.  Stuff like the grouping bug has been known
for months now...and yet it's still broken. <smile>  It's beta.  Face it and
move on with your life <smile>.
