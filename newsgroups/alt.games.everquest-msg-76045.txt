Sorry for the OT everyone, but I run EQ on this PC and I dont know where
else to ask this and have as quick of a response. I just got a Dell
Dimension 8200 for Xmas. It came with a 40GB HD formatted using NTFS (OS is
XP Home) I installed a 20GB HD from my old PC my ? is how do i format it
from FAT32 to NTFS? There are no files on it and when i try and format it
gives some error message that the drive cannot be formatted as it is in use.

Any ideas?
