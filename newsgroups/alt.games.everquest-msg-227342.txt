Critical messages should be on hotkeys.  But keep it brief, please.

">>CHeal on %T<<" is no problem.  "%T Mezzed" is used in groups I don't play
with often, and if I get too many broken mezzes I'll go as far as digging
out my "%T is on hold, you wake it you tank it!" hotkey from page 3.
(Rangers get more careful about arrow line-of-site when you can Boggle an
awakened mob back onto them.)

"May Tunare bless %T with her healing touch, that we may continue to fight
Her foe and slay it in Her name" and "By the Power of my Will, %T will stand
with mind sundered!" gets tiresome the FIRST time.  Roleplaying is fun and
all, but there's a limit.  The third time I see it, I start sending the
healer /tells to cut it out.  The fifth time I send tells to the group
leader.  I've been known to leave groups over excessive blather of this
sort!
