Hey all,

I had this idea the other day and wanted to see what others think:

Most of the old world and non-recently added quests are too much work
for what the reward is, when compared to what you can get in the
Bazaar often for low amounts of plat. In fact, some would argue that
the questing aspect of the game has diminished into a few tradeskill
and high end quests that are required to progress or give some benefit
that is actually worth the trouble. Generally though, noone goes out
seeking quests on their own anymore, because 99% of the time, it won't
be worth it.

Now I really like questing sometimes, but I'm discouraged by the
mostly worthless rewards. I believe that the journey matters more than
the destination, but nevertheless, I feel the journey would be more
exciting if there was an actual usefull, reward at the end, even if it
was small.

My idea is basically to extend what PoP charm does for some quests to
virtually ALL quests. Each quest would give your charm some minnimal
additional benefit. Something like +1% fishing skill or +1 sv cold for
simple quests maybe up to +1 INT or +1 STR for tough quests...
something along those lines.

I bet that would be enough for a lot of (especially lower level)
characters to get interested in questing again, and bring back some of
the lore of the game as people are exposed to more content - and get
rewarded for doing so.

Maybe even make your charm be linkable by anyone inspecting you,
allowing you to show off your experience in Everquest - a great
starting point to evaluate a character for groups, raids or guilds.

I'm also thinking that this could be programmatically easy for SOE
(since we know nothing complicated will ever be done to old content).
They could create a table of possible rewards ordered by how valuable
a certain stat increase is, and just randomly pick a stat increase
from somewhere in the table close to proportonially to its difficulty.
So, assuming that there is a way to find a 'difficulty index' of a
particular quest, this could be implemented without having to take the
time to look at each quest. If no such difficulty index exists, it
could still possibly be computed by multiplying several numerical
facts of the quest: the number of mobs required to kill, the number of
items required to collect, the rarity(is that a word?) of those items,
the level of those mobs, the number of npcs to talk to, the length of
conversations ... I'm sure one could come up with a formula to find a
reasonable difficulty index from existing data, maybe adjusting it for
some specific quests if needed.

I'm thinking of playing with this idea some more and actually making a
detailed description of it and make the suggestion to SOE... if
someone else here thinks it's a good idea that's worth talking about
=)
