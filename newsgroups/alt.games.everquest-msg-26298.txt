You certainly don't need them. 

The test is:

1 - Are you enjoying the game as is?
2 - Are you bored with the content you have?

If you're enjoying the game and are not bored with the original
content, then you don't need the expansions. If you're enjoying the
game but are bored with the original content, then consider getting at
least one of the expansions.

And if you're no longer enjoying the game, and bored with the original
content, then possibly new content would help, but maybe not.
