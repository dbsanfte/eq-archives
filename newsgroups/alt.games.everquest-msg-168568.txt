}Yes, but worrying about statistically insignificant deviants bogs the
}discussion down, so we may skip over them, and deal with the views as as
}whole.

If you throw out -all- the statistically insignificant groups, there won't 
be anybody left.

}> From dictionary.com:
}You can't use dictionary definitions in this debate.

Try and stop me.  Never mind, it's too late, I just did.

}If you take the modern liberal's views, they tend towards fascism.

Malarkey, pure and simple.  I know a lot of 'liberals', probably more than 
'conservatives'.  Of those, I'd say those that believe the government 
should have more power are, to use your words, statistically insignificant.

Sort of like liberal democrats. :)

}If you take the modern moderate's views, they tend towards the 
}conservative.

If they tend towards conservative, they aren't moderate, now, are they?

}If you take the modern conservative's views, they tend towards classical 
}liberalism.

That, at least, has some truth to it.  But it's an oversimplification.

}Using dictionary definitions only confuses the issue when describing 
}modern political movements.

I do believe you're accusing me of dumping mud in a sewer. :)
