I've just been playing my first week back in Norrath after going AWOL for 9
months, and have noticed that there is now a new European server available.
Well, I'm wondering if its possible to transfer my characters from the
Luclin server to Antonius Bayle...

I've done a bit of research and found that AB is very young and the movelog
was only a couple of weeks ago. I'm wondering if I have missed my chance to
transfer my characters to the new server already? Also, I've noticed theyve
implemented a new character transfer system, but its not operational at the
moment, and they aren't giving many details away. Would I be able to switch
servers through this when its back up? I also heard theres a 50 dollar cost
for the service... something I am not really prepared to pay.

Thanks for all your future input guys :)
