	Not achieve, exactly...  Except in the sense that I want to
achieve relaxation and escape.  I'd much rather spend 2 hours sitting
in the (reviled :-) POK volunteering buffs and rezzes than 2 hours 
running across the zones that A) I've already seen 100 times and B)
look just like all the other zones because Sony recycles models and
textures the way my grandmother recycled wrapping paper and C) are
empty except for me and some guy farming giants/hoppers/shard pieces
anyway.

	In order for me to have fun and relax I need to do _something_
Running doesn't count, nor does sitting in long camps oneshotting green
placeholders...  I *like* POK, because I *can* sit there and use it as
a town square, people watching on ooc, offering a hand to people in need, 
and even (recently) advice to newer clerics...  

	Yourself and some of the others have greatly illuminated my
understanding of how the changes we've been discussing, well, changed, 
the gameworld.  I can see how those changes might have made the experience
less in some ways, but I think that it also made it greater in some.  That's
why I stayed this time, because it was more fun and more relaxing than it
was in 1999.  Yes, I do see how it's easier.  IMHO thats a feature not
a bug :-)

	BTW, I always made it a point to explore all of the zones I could.
Sort of like flying to San Francisco and renting a car to drive to the wine
country, as opposed to taking a covered wagon right to Sonoma :-)
