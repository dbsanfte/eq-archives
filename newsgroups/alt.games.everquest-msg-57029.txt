Hello All,
I am a 28th wood elf ranger.  I have the following stats with current
equipment:
103 Str
77 sta
110 dex
130 agi
dual wielding a PGT 6/26 in primary hand, and sarnak claw 7/33 in off hand
Dual wield and double attack in the 110ish range.
My attacks hit for about 12-16 dam a pop.
What is a strategy for increasing 1hs damage some of you ranger or other
classes have used?
What weapons do you recommend within reach of a poor non-twinked lvl 28
ranger who spends
all his bloody plat on fletching?
Thanks for the insight.

Frank
