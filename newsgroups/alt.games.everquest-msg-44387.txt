I migfht have missed this in the posts somewhere, but does anyone know what
exactly happend last.. friday I think it was?

There were 2 travellers walking through DL, went to Burning Woods and later
on passed OT (had a fw guildies there reporting it). Right after that an
enormous bang was heard (or along those lines) in or around the Skyfire
Zone.

I heard a few people say there was a Cazic-Thule avatar, who got beat up and
there was something about a lifestone. I really don't know more about this,
but does someone else have some more info?
