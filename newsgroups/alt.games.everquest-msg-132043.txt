Is there any reason to have set point costs rather than auctions ?

Presumably the time issues of the auction ?

If item x cost 5 points and there are 10 players with 5 points who want
it who gets it ?
Presumably the one with the most points.
I would guess however that the item should then cost them one point more
than the second highest has points.

E.g.

A has 15 points
B has 10 points 
C has 5 points

All want a 5 point item

A wins, but must pay 11 points

Leaving : A=4 B=10 C=5

Is this right ?
It's how I would do it.

Jim
