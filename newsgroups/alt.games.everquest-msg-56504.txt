The old gang is working up a new alt group and since folks here enjoy
giving opinions I'm asking for one.  We are in all right around lvl 30
and have a definite warrior/enchanter/cleric core with a probable druid
as well.  The last gangster is the one with the issue, he has both a
bard and a monk around the right lvl to work into the group and neither
he nor I can come to a conclusion as to which would be "best".

So there you opinionated folks have it...now let's hear which you think
is better for good grouping with the other classes listed, indoors and
outdoors, just general game play.  Giving your thought processes instead
of just saying "monk" or "bard" would help to balance out conflicting
opinions <g>.

thanks in advance
