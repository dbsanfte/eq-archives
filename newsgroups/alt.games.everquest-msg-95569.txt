You should be able to turn them into the Captain of the Militia. As a DE
Necro you won't be too popular with the Militia or general populace of
commons/FP but my DE SK could hand the belts in. It is good to work on
militia faction, later you will end up killing the guards anyway for exp and
Paladin faction (NFP bank is closer than Neriaks and atm you ARE KoS with
the Knights of Truth in NFP)
