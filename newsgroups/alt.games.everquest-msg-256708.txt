My oh my, what DID you do to your factions?  My Karana druid wanders
Freeport all the time.  Heck, I used her to run the "Rebby's Whiskers"
quest (using SOW and Gate) to collect the turn-ins and give them to
my Iksar to fix several of his factions there.  (The druid also got
to do the nearby Janam quest, so she got some faction out of it, too.)

Regarding some other things that have popped up elsewhere in this
thread, I can definitely appreciate the fuzziness of the line between
role-playing and trying to advance in the game.  My Iksar is trying to
raise his faction with all the "good" groups, mostly because it's a
pain getting mugged by druids and whatnot when porting or just running
through the Karanas or Commonlands etc.  But I also justify it somewhat
from a role-playing standpoint: he's not necessarily "good", but he's
willing to work with anyone to get what he needs, and that's a lot
easier if people don't kill him on sight.  Although some factions have
maxed out so he's "kindly" or even "ally" in some unlikely places, he's
quite content to have lots of folks glower at him dubiously.  Be dubious
all ya want, suckers, just let me go about my business!

The only downside is that he's had to give up eating babies, at least
in public. :-)

Oh, and the other remark I wanted to make is that the sequence of
one-line additions to "the muffin man?" had me laughing out loud. :-)
