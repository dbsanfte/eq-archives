But then back to the idea that Knights make better tanks.  Warriors have
More HPs and can mitigate melee damage better than Knights.  The only reason
I see that casters like Kinghts is they can save their butts when they screw
up quicker than a warrior.  But from a pure mana point of veiw, warriors are
better because healers will need to burn less mana on us to heal us.  Since
the game is caster heavy and slanted towards casters then I can see why they
like Kinghts.  But having a Knight is not the most efficient class to use as
a tank.
