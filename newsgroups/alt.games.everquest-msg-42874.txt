Okay...  I have a silly skill question.

Does anyone use the beg skill?  I have made it a point to put some points
into it, and practice it, and although my skill is going up (slowly) I have
not had a success yet in 5 levels (skill is now approximately 35).

Is this normal, or have I just been wasting time on a skill that will never
be successful?
