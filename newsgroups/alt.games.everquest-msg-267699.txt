If an aggressive mob's been pulled some distance from their spawn point, do 
they transfer aggression to whoever's in the area once the lock's broken?

Or do they return to their spawn point before becoming aggressive again?

I ask because I'm trying to figure out whether or not I was "pk'd" by a much 
higher level character pulling a mob to me and then breaking his lock on 
them.  That's what it seemed like to me, but I was killed so quickly it was 
hard to tell.

I surely hope this kind of griefing isn't possible.

And I hope my question's clear, too . . . :-)
