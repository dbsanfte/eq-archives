I agree that the design is not conducive to gaining items via a long
camp. However, this IS the designer's intention. The designers
PURPOSEFULLY made the spawn like that so you DON'T camp it but rather
so that someone "gets lucky" in passing. Someone eventually WILL get
lucky in passing as long as other people with too much time on their
hands don't purposefully camp it.

Its a bit like the powerball lottery. People DO win the powerball, its
designed for one person to win sometimes. Buying one ticket is the way
to have the same chance of winning as someone else while selling all
your possessions and buying 35,000 tickets is not. The person doing
that could then say that its the Lottery Commission's fault they sold
everything they have and did not win the lottery. It isn't. 

When you try to work against the obvious design of the game, you are
not going to have a good time doing it (unless you are insanely
patient.) If you work WITH the design, things will eventually work
out.
