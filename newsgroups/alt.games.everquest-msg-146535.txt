I was kiting drolvarcs around in dl last and looked around to see one of my
bunch was loose and hitting something so I thought sh*t i must have run past
a medding player and turned back to find some god damn beastlord had taken a
rager of the back of my pack and was killing it. What a friggin cheek,
contemplated gating out and leaving him the other 3 too but didnt.
