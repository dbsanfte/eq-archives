Of course not. Don't be silly. But I seriously doubt all of the
taunters that I've talked to were "too impatient" to let the skill
raise without dumping a point into it. The simple FACT is that it's
not happening. Period. Dumping 1 point into it wouldn't make such a
DRAMATIC increase in gains that you could suddenly max it out in one
level when it never once raised in 10+ levels.
