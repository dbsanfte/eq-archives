Well, I have just had everything on my C: drive go bye bye.  I use 2000 and
it designated my root drive D, so I'm still around, but I have a good bit of
installing to do now.  This is the third time this has happened with EQ.  I
say with EQ because each time it has happened, chkdsk returned all kinds of
bad news about a lot of EQ files, and nothing but EQ files.  Within a few
reboots of trying to fix those corruptions, I manage to mangle the drive to
the point that wiping it out and starting again seems to be the only way to
proceed.  It's probably not the drive, as I have had it happen to two
different drives (twice on one and once on the other).  At least by now I
have learned not to let EQ and Windows share a drive.

All that having been said, I cannot be certain that the patch itself caused
this.  Or even that EQ did.  But I guessed it might be worth sharing.
