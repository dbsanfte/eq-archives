I don't know that pride is the correct sentiment for my names; however, I do
mostly play wtih RL friends.  The names might be silly but they also are
descriptions of who my characters are.  Though they seem cheasy they easily
describe what kind of person that character would be if I was roleplaying.
If they don't seem like "good" names to the people that have posted above, I
could certainly come up with original names that have absolutely no
relationship to anything a person might know.  But I don't think my names
are all that bad, a little corny maybe, but did you people have to be so
mean about it?  I mean how about a /chuckle?
