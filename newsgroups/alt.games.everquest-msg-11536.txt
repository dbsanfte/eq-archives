 There's been rumor of a 'soft cap' for awhile now. With Kunark it was
believed to be 1100. I heard it was bumped to 1400 with Velious but
nothing official.


 Anyway, I'm a monk and I'm presently at 1100AC unbuffed and I still
have some upgrades to do. I'm guessing I could get to 1150 unbuffed
fairly easy.

 Depends on how often you're getting aggro. It's usually more
mana-efficient (complete heal) to keep the mob on the warrior. But
really, if you're getting aggro a lot during fights you may want to
switch to a slower weapon or something. I'm just saying that if you see
a monk feign a few times in a group it doesn't mean they are a bad monk.
