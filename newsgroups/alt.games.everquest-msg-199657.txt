It is still there.
Note the ".topic" that wrapped.
I got some errors trying to connect just now too, but it seems ok now.

Here is the link again 
http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=39381.topic
That will probably wrap too.

Basically they are implementing pop-up menus that alow you to select 
spells by type rather than opening a spell book.

E.g. Right click on an empty spell gem
Menu of general spell descriptions pops up.
Headings like DoT, DD, Pet, Heal, Regen, Utility Benifical etc.
These then give sub menus.
e.g. DD > Cold, Destroy (?) Fire, Magic and Summoned.
These menues go to a list of the spell that you have scribed, showing 
name and level.
