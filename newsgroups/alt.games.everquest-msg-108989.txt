37 AA levels at level 55...

That means he has his second title (arch) and is 5 from his final title
(level 59+ only though) at level 55...

Which is even more proof how bullshit this auction is... he's fully geared
in uber loot (which means a lot of raids) yet has so much time he can get 37
AA levels?  Whilst going to school every day...

The words "found", "out", and "prick" spring to mind
