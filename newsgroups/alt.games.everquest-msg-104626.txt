Also taken from:
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp
In 1.1, Section 2

2.You may not ninjaloot.
Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen
creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature
if they are in attendance. The purpose of this rule is to stop those who
stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that
equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.
