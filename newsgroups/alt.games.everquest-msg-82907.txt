Hi everyone!  A Friend of mine killed the Priest of Najeena and I
looted the Polished Brass Key.  When I trucked it over to Najeena and
gave the key to Linara (whatever her name is) she took the key and
said "um...not sure what you'd like me to do with this, but thank you"
 And that was it!!

She conned amiabe to me, so it wasn't faction...is there another key
other then that one???

Your help is greatly appreciated everyone.
