    I wasn't too happy with the TLC either.  I 
pay the same money as everyone else, I should 
be able to loot any goddamned thing I kill.
I'm not a farmer, and doubt if I ever will be,
and I don't like being treated like I _might_
be one.
   But the language was a real killer.  Run
up to a group I might want to join.  No one
speaks dark elf.  Run to another group. 
Same story.  A real mood killer.  I got
lonely.

    Yeah, I'm sure they all go home at 
5pm.  So that's no problem.  And I certainly
have the programming skills to redo an
entire server.  Heck, I'll just redo ALL 
the servers, making it possible for everyone
to have High Elf necromancers and Troll
monks.  And wisps will start dropping 
mana stones.

   OMG, someone actually reads my sig??
I killed off the old Teacure.  She was a
level 14 halfling, and a victem of style.
I just think the halfings look ugly now,
why the High Elves look FABulous.  I'm
not really into playing a cleric, anyways,
but I wanted to reserve the name in
case I ever had a  change of heart.
Playing an enchanter really left me
cold, so I killed Teacast, my HE 
enchanter, but still wanted to have a
HE to play around with, should the fancy
strike me.  Hence the baby Teacure.
