My Paladin main finally dinged 60 last night after a year and a half.
After dinging, I realized that reaching the 60 goal (set prior to PoP)
didn't please me in the slightest. After a night's sleep, I have decided
that it is time to move on. I could easily go to a newbie zone and
simply give away all my stuff, but I'd like some ideas on interesting
ways to do it. I have dozens of chars over several servers at levels
between 20 and 60, so it would take a few hours or days to dispose of it
all. Any and all ideas welcome, even crazy ones!!
