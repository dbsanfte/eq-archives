At level 40 (39 pet) I took every room including the Ogre Captain and that
frogluk guy's room solo. I only never went to the Spiders after hearing a 46
monk got the s*** beat out of him.

I went with water pet at first, but switched to the earth after I had to
chase down an ogre all the way to the entrance.

At 49 you can take a fire one, send it into a room, sit down and have a
snack.

Najena is easy, but getting there might be a problem because pets don't go
into the water at that point and there are 2 frogluks that start hitting you
and send your pet flying through the dungeon. Make sure you have summon
companion ready.
