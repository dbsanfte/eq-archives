They don't really - normal aggro rules - if you nuke all four, and your 
friend was the only thing on their hate list, now you're top and they're 
all coming for you.  But, even if that doesn't work imagine you and your 
friend are standing next to each other, it doesn't matter if you or they 
are on the hate list the mobs are sticking together and heading at the 
pair of you.

So, stick together, nuke in turn or even at the same time, and the quad 
won't break (even if you get resists, as long as you're both together 
then the quad sticks).

Never had to do that.
