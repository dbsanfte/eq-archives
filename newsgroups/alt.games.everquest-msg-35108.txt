I don't know what it'll cost on your server, should be fairly cheap, but get
the small scarab breastplate.  It's ac14 and has str and sta modifiers.  It
also has a minus 1 dex which might be bad for you, I've never played a
rogue.  But, if you get the hat and boots to go with it, it looks really
cool.

I think halflings in it look like marvin the martian from bugs bunny.  I've
thought about creating a halfling just to run around looking like that.  I'd
hang out by the saucer in qeynos and ask everyone that passes by to take me
to their leader.
