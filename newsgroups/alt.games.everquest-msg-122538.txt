VI never said it was impossible. It was "impossible", because VI said
they would never do/allow it. They said the same thing about removing
hell levels and the Hybrid Exp Penalty. You have caught them in
another lie. Not the first time and not the last.

I just don't think VI is as "Evil-Greedy" as you make them out to be.
They started with character Xfers for a fee. People that wanted to
join friends on other servers were very happy. The majority (I count
myself among them) decided the cost wasn't worth it. The same thing
happened with Legends, and is bound to happen with Name changes. 

The player base has given them all the incentive they need, and like
any good business they are making money off of it. If you want to
blame anyone for the "service for a fee" direction EQ is taking, blame
the players. Hell, I've seen a couple posts today suggestion that VI
sell tradeskill mastery for a fee.

I didn't say I liked the direction the game is taking. I said the
"services for a fee" didn't bother me. I don't use them, and I have
never had my gaming experience lessoned by them. I do agree with you
about the ethics and lies involved throughout the evolution of the
game. I guess we are on the same page, just looking at different
paragraphs :-)

>But then, the majority has been well trained by it's government and society itself.

If you haven't notice the "majority" (eq the player base) is driving
the changes we find ourselves lamenting.
