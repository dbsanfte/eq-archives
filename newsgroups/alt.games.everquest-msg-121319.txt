there have been a few studies on training cats and if i can find where again
and this thread is still going ill post them.  one of the things that was
mentioned about cats being less trainable is a problem using negative
reinforcement with them.  with a dog you can use the carrot and the stick.
with a cat the carrot works but use the stick and the training goes bad.
same problem with apes also.  it got a little complex for me (i study chem
not psych)
