It's easy. When you vote according to who you *don't* want to be elected, 
then your vote for who you *do* want is never cast. It's not meant to be 
some sort of game where one might hedge their bets, so to speak. To treat 
it as such is, IMO, as much a mockery of the process as the inappropriate 
influences various lobbyist and special interest groups often have on 
candidates.

I'm all for addressing any deficiencies in the process. I'm just against 
voting under false pretenses.

I might agree with that to some extent...I think. :P
