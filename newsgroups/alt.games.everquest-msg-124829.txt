I was in a chat with an EQ guildmate, and my girlfriend was looking for some
attention. I told my guildmate I needed to log and he protested since we
needed to finish some guild business. I told him I was being "corner tanked"
by her and he completely understood and laid off. Later, "corner tanking"
became a twisted and confused, as well as a very acceptable, way to say you
needed to log for some sweet lovin'.

We have swipe card keys to doors in my lab. Sometimes they pause and don't
open. I hold the swipe card in front of the reader and say "U".

Someone asked me the other day why the Novell network was so slow. I told
him, "GM event".

When I see my advisor walking down the hall, I see if my 'evade' hot button
is active, cause I know he sees through sneak and hide.
