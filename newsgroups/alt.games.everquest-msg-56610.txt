Well, now we have one European server, which is good for me, seeing as
I'm European.  So what does Verant do?  Apply a move log, disastrously
changing the economy and the enjoyment of the game for anyone wanting
to play from scratch.  Within minutes of the server coming up after
the patch, I saw level 40-50s camping the orcs in EC solo, preventing
anyone from getting exp there.

For God's sake - bring up another Euro server, only this time, no move
log.  I'd like a decent ping without the level 60s, please.  Give us
all a chance.

I don't mind the fact that folks have moved their level 60s over, and
maybe there was a reason for it, it's certainly seemed to be popular.
I'm just asking for the low levels to be given a chance.  Seeing teen
levels in GF with plane gear just makes the server seem jaded
somehow..

Maybe it's just envy, though - hey, if anyone sees a cute looking
woodie elf warrior called Becci, give her some nice gear =P
