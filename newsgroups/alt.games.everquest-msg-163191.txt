Thanks for the advice.  I am a class 1 KEI addict.  It has allowed me to
solo up to 16.
That is the reason I wanted to group, to learn to work with groups.
My main is a 55 Ranger, so I know how the system works, just need to
practice it from this end.
Trader also has an average INt of 196 and Chr of 146, without buffs.
Twinked all to hell and back.
