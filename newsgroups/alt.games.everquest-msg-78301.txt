Net or gross? ;)

Grats, BTW, on an uber weekend. I can't wait until I can start slaying 
dragons :)

I had a great EQ weekend also. My guild had an impromptu Sol A raid, which 
was pretty cool, as my highest is 30 and I had never been deep in Sol A. 

Here's a question for you guys- My guild has a lot of 30-35 people in it. 
Where is a good place to stage a raid? I was thinking Mistmoore(since I 
have things to kill there anyway and it seems like a fun zone). Any other 
suggestions?
