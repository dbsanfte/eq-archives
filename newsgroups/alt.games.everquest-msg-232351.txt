Twice now my left/right arrow keys and my mouse keys have gone into a
weird mode.  The left and right arrows act like they have the control
key depressed (I slide from left to right) and clicking on my hot-keys
with the mouse doesn't work.  The first time there was no problem.
Logged out, rebooted and logged back in.  This last time I died.  I
got a rez so not much exp lost.  This has been since the last patch.
Anyone else having such a problem?  Oh, it was on two different
computers (both have the same cpu, video card, memory, sound card,
network card, hard drive, motherboard,...)  

thanks,

Robert
