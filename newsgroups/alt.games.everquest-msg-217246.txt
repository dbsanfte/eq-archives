    Yes, because many rooms have doors right in the middle of them.

    Monday night, LDoN adventure (Tak theme). Hallway, N/S, one mob in the
middle of the hallway, with doors beside it to the E and W. The mob was
pulled with an arrow, and three additional mobs came out of the two doors
with the pull. Had that been a Hard adventure, that would have been an
unpleasant surprise.

    Apparently, using arrows to pull is wrong.

    Actually, joined the guild nearly two years ago, helped them become the
lead guild on the server, and THEN got my epic late one night with three
other people and two second boxes after soloing all the shards in Skyfire.
If you'd been around this newsgroup for any length of time, you'd remember
my mentioning my epicless status for the longest time.

    It's too bad PoP is so easy that any old person can make the elementals.

My

    Um, that a level 44 cleric (you know, one that can cast Temperance,
Symbol, and Reso with those HPs/AC) doesn't have his level 49 Shield of
Words spell yet? Really, are you trying to look dumb?

    Yes, bully for you. Now add up the number of HPs and AC those three
buffs give at level 44, the level when you get Temperance. You know, the
level at which one has to decide which spell is best? Here, let me give you
Lucy links so you don't fuck this up:

    I'd ask you to stick to being a monk, but you seem to suck at that too.
