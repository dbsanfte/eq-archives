3) The rear ender is the result of another accident.

And possibly:
4) The rearendee's vehicle was not roadworthy. (e.g. driving at night 
without lights or reflectors might transfer -some- of the fault to the 
rearendee.) Don't know for sure about that one, but I -think- the rear 
ender might have a shot with that argument.
