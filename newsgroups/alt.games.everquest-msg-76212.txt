Dont see anything wrong with him going AFK and not looking at the screen 
at all times, do that myself. But if hes still AFK when the spawns are 
up, its his loss.
Have had 1 time where someone did that to me because i had a bio call 
and didnt see the camp check. So what, thats my fauilt, not theirs. No 
need to shout at them for that, its only 16-20 min till next spawn, 
depending on the camp.
