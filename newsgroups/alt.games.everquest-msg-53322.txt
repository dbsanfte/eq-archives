When you walk down the street, you can glance at someone and tell that
they're wearing blue jeans, a leather jacket, maybe a silver necklace,
and diamond earrings. You cannot do this in EQ due to graphics
limitations. Because the game engine is limited in the different
graphics it can produce, most items do not have unique graphics.
Therefore, it is impossible to tell by merely looking what someone is
wearing. Hence the ability to inspect - it is not a tool to invade
someone's privacy any more than glancing at passersby on the street
is.
