I haven't even tried to run Everquest on my current laptop because I just 
know 
the video isn't adequate.

If I decide to upgrade, does anyone have any recommendations? I'd like to 
hear 
from people who have actually run EQ on a laptop, and what they used. I'm 
assuming that video is the biggest problem, rather than processor speed.
