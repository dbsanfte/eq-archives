Dude, I don't work at Sony, and *I* could have told the NG to get ready 
for a ton of patches. Anybody who has played this game for any length of 
time could.

I was at E3 this year too, and even though I wasn't granted access to 
the Sony booth, I have no reason to doubt you there. EQ was big, but SWG 
is going to mark the point when MMORPGS *really* go mainstream. I don't 
even think EQ2 has that much brainshare amongst Sony executives.

On the other hand, even if POP is the last expansion for EQ1 and they 
can slowly move the creatives to other teams, there is no reason why EQ 
cannot last many years yet, even if it's on a shrinking server base, 
even possibly past the point where it's not economical for Sony to do 
so. They are in the MMORPG business to stay, and probably they don't 
need the bad PR of turning faithful paying users off.
