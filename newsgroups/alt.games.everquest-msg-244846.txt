He's posted his credentials about mmm, once every 2-3 months or so for the 
last couple years.  Do you expect us all to list every character we ever 
played in every post we make, so you can be spared the pain of actually 
remembering who's who?  Have we seen -your- EQ resume?  Many folks here 
don't post it all the time, just because it (a) feels like bragging, and 
(b) makes for ungodly long sig lines.

You're right, he's been lurking far too long.  Why, he hasn't posted in 
another thread since the 15th!  That's almost a whole week!  Ohh, what an 
evil Ivory-tower lurker!
