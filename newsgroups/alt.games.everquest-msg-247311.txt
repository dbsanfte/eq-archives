No to all, but that doesn't change the fact that its use in that regard 
would any less sense from the standpoint of correctness. Why was "toon" 
considered correct? How did it become any more acceptible? If I started 
the trend of using the term "scrapers" in this sense, would it then make 
so much more sense to you, merely because more people would then be using 
it on a more regular basis?

Heh, it was. :P

That would be a less similar term, to be sure, but a decent example of 
how a few shared attributes do not ensure an interchangeability in their 
usage.
