Some observations and some speculation.

I have been through right after the zone repops and apparently at least one
mob is dropped next to the wall and stationary. If the first person goes
through slowly, the mob moves away from with wall when approached.

If someone is motoring with SoW or Selo's they will get within the aggresso
range before the mob has a chance to clear the area. Obviously this screws
things up for the next round of visitors as you noticed.

Since you can't control who else is moving along the wall and how they are
doing it, you are probably making a good choice.
