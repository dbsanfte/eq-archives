The stat buffs are pretty useless at that level, I did always keep my best 
hp and stamina buffs up though, more hp is better.

I used nuke and melee primarilly at the lower levels, so, even though the 
nukes are small, they do add up.

Keep you self sowed, cast the DoT from max distance, if root breaks, run a 
bit, then reroot.  I still use this technique at level 61 in PoN.

Yep, even after I got Run 3, I still keep Sow up most of the time, as it is 
faster.

I usually kept Gate memmed at lower levels, it did serve me well for 
escaping from certain death 3 times while red to me mobs were pounding on 
me.  So, rare, but real handy when needed.

The really bad levels are when you are within one or two levels of getting 
your next heal spell.  It is almost impossible to keep up with damage 
inflicted at those levels.

I did not really understand the mechanics of the game back then.  I always 
slow now, whether soloing or grouping.  Soloing, as you said, it means I 
have time to reroot, even when the mob is hitting me.

Root and rot, the only way I solo in PoN.  Other places, with mobs that hit 
for less, I use my pet as well.

Can plus Regen is very nice.

It has a lot to do with the level of the animals you can charm as a shaman.    
The spell is decent when you get it at level 29, you can charm animals up 
to level 24.  At level 34, you get Charm Animal, which will allow you to 
charm up to level 34, again decent for a while.  No further upgrades to 
charm for shaman, so, it quickly becomes useless.  Also, you get pet spells 
as well, the pet is much more reliable, although not as fast for XPing if 
you like to live dangerously.

Used it a lot.

Yep, pain in the butt for when you really need it.

Every spell level until the 50s.  Last pet is at 61, Very nice pet too.

For soloing, at very low levels, I did tank/DD/heal.  (I didn't really 
understand the mechanics, so didn't use slow or haste until later).  In the 
20s, I started using root and nuke, and kiting.  Found that I could easilly 
kite yellow mobs up into the mid 30s or so using nukes for damage.  
Eventually, started using the pet, fully buffed, and kept him healed, while 
I debuffed and DoTed the mob.  At 61, I use root and rot in PoP, and I use 
the pet most anywhere else.
