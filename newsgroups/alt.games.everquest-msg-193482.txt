  You're donating only 10pp for KEI?  Is that the
new standard these days?  Guess that's what happens
when servers get overloaded with enchanters who have
to fight for customers - I notice on Bristlebane nearly
all of the KEI'rs mention in their advertising that donations
are appreciated "but not required".

  And I was wondering why that enchantress I donated
75pp to was so grateful....
