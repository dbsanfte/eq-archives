	The whole fish-out-of-water thing bugs me.  How many times have
you been hanging out on the beach in Cobalt Scar and had "a coldwater
barracuda bites you for 20..." ?  And you can't even see the thing cause 
it's swimming under the sand...

	Although I guess if orcs can swim in the trees then fish should be 
able to swim in the ground.
