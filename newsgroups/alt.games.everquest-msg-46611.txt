Well, with all due respect, the fact that "most" of your friends are doctors
and lawyers is a big part of the problem.  Doctors tend to exaggerate things
(to inflate bills and protect themselves legally) and lawyers do the same,
but not for protection's sake but for the sake of the Dollar.

It is certainly wise to be wary of what the terrorists could do, but I doubt
that they have the material and wherewithal to do what everyone is saying is
extremely possible that they could.  The terrorists say that America had Her
guard down and they attacked.  Given our present state of alert (we a nation
of reaction rather than proaction), I doubt the terrorists are capable of
doing anything more than they have done.  The terrorists are pretty much a
rag-tag group with no tight organizational structure or overall
sophistication.  With the our security as lapse as it was before the
bombings, anyone could have put together a dozen folks and did,
horrendously, what the terrorists did.

But the media and others who are always keen for making a buck, have made
this terror attack something more than what it was: a group of haters
exploiting a vulnerability.  As I said before, the World has to be on its
toes-- as it always should have been-- but to go to this extent and make
these suppositions is spreading paranoia for material gain.
