I think you were unlucky. I still haven't been attacked in that zone
by anything other than something dragged to a zoneline.

Check that, I got attacked by the shralok up on the wall when it was
first put in. Wasn't paying attention, ran right by him. He was a bit
of a surprise but he didn't kill me.

 the previous night. This turned out to be an intensely positive
 experience, as it allowed me to sit back and count the number of ways
 the Internet has corrupted me and exposed me to a world of stupidity
 and filth that I previously never knew existed."
