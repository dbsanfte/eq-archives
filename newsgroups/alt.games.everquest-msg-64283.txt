Have you ever worked at a tech job and figured "I can install that ram
and modem and have this thing working in 40 minutes", and then ran
into a snag? I was building a puter for my aunt out of a bare bones
system she bought and kept running into problems like that, just stuff
that I could not possibly have allotted time for since I did not know
it would happen (like IRQs refusing to cooperate, picky modem, etc)

Now, multiply that on a scale of like 100 and you probably get the
idea of the complexity of problems they might have on a big ole bunch
of server sets if even the smallest thing goes wrong.

Its the price we pay for the engine updates. With velious there was no
down time and some people who ordered velious got it as many as THREE
days before the "live" date. They were then visible in velious since
you could go there right after installing it. So in that instance you
could say verant was really ahead of the game but its really like
comparing apples and oranges since the server did not have to be
brought down to updo the entire game.

WHOAH CHECKING FOR FILES AS I TYPE THIS OMG

LATER AA!H!H!H!!
