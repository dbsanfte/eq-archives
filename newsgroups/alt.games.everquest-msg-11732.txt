Of course, thank you

I meant that a shaman would have a shield in off hand and an AC trinket 
in the primary hand. So, 9 ac from Paw and 25 ac from Naggy's shield 
would add up to 34 raw ac, or about 51 ac worn. Plus I'm sure there 
would be some nicer ac toys at higher levels.
51 ac is quite a bit. Actually just about that amount drove a lot of 
human monks to restart as iksars
BTW, if you count a normal belt against an FBSS, the worn AC difference 
raises to 66

I thought we were talking about taking damage, not dealing it :) And I 
do believe there are quite a few more rangers wearing an FBSS than 
shamans

Absolutely. There are too few tanking shamans to begin with, and I'm 
sure they didn't become shamen for the purpose of being the main tank.
