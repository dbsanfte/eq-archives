I recently started a new Halfling in Rivervale, and BOY have the upper-level
players been nice!  Every time I turn around someone is either buffing me or
giving me a piece of equipment.  I just want to say "Thank You" to all of
you upper level guys out there that are nice to the little newbies.  We
appreciate you!!  We have to work so hard just to stay alive and your help
makes it so much easier!

I'm looking forward to the day when my character is upper level and I can
help people out too.  There's a lot of great folks out there in Norrath!

Connie
