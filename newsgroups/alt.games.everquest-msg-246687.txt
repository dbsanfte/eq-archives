I care about it. I'm just not so paranoid as to think SOE's going to
put a trojan onto my computer so they can try to hack into my computer
and fuck around with it. Take the tinfoil hat off, boy. Common fucking
sense: ActiveX scan of the system to get an accurate report of your
hardware, thus cutting down on the number of people trying to lie
about their system and throwing off the testing.
