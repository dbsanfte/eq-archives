Erudite women used to be some of the sexiest around.  Now they all
look like steroid-laden female bodybuilders.

Trolls don't look nearly as ugly/scary as they used to.

As far as Ogres, like I said before... if I want to see a fat human,
I'll look in a mirror.  The old form was distinctly non-human.

All the Dwarves look like they've been on starvation diets; they used
to look like heavyset musclemen, now they look like jockeys.
