You seemed to have snipped this;

>motionless mixers near factories or cities .

Again; 
What figures did you use to work out that China is
the largest producer of pollution, and that the US
is not in the top ten?

> To try and point out where I am
>wrong you will have to actually come up with data. 

Why should I be proving you wrong, surely you
should be proving you are correct?

I am inviting you to share your sources for your
assertion that China is the biggest producer of
pollution and that the US is not in the top ten.

>Not the ramblings of the faithfull.

I am agnostic at the moment, waiting to see what
credible evidence there is for all sorts of
claims.

How, exactly, does this help your assertion?

There is no mention here of China being the
largest producer of pollution, nor of the US not
being in the top ten.
