This is highly dependant on the level of the chanter; at low levels,
their channeling skills suck enough that casting while being beat on
often means dying before getting anywhere.  They don't just get
more mana as they level up, their skills increase and they get
some better spells.  At high levels, I don't think I'd even consider
trying to pull anything off the chanter.

This should be part of a thread titled "Verant Trains us Wrong"...
the things we learn to do at low levels turn out to be exactly
the wrong things at high levels.

I'm hoping that at a level where he are asking about how and
what to assist, that he's low level enough to still have to worry
about the "get it off me" job.  Come to think of it though, even
at low levels chanters et al are capable of making "get it off me"
buttons, which would take the pressure off the secondary tank
as to whether this is appropriate behaviour.

See, there's another similar issue.  At high levels, clerics rarely need
rescuing like that; they can stun, back off, immobilize, and ignore
the target, unless quarters are very tight.  In their twenties, though
getting that initial stun off is tricky due to low channelling, and
their only Root spell is a good deal slower than Immobilize.

Adds on casters are a good target for rescue... except that if its a serious
add, what you are likely looking at is rather taking care of the fight and
then keeping the area clear while you res the caster.  Talk about brittle!

Cleric job one, keep the chanter alive.  Chanter job one, keep the
cleric alive.  Hopefully enough others will stay alive to kill all the
mobs before the chanter goes too OOM to keep the crowd mezed...

I understand what you are saying, but in my case at least (one High
Elf cleric to 49, one Dwarf cleric to 52 thus far) I can assure you that
I'm not afraid of taking some damage... I'm not a caster, or even
a druid, I have more HP than any non tank and likely half the tanks
my level, and more AC than any non melee and most of the non-tank
melees.  Aggro doesn't stay on me for long periods of time, and I
use a group heal and/or buff often enough that healing myself from
incedental damage doesn't really take any mana at all.

I'm good at -not- getting aggro, mind you, in fact I suffered a bit on my
second cleric, by leveling up to 30 before realizing I wasn't working on
my Defense skill enough.

Now I keep Defense capped out and wear combat gear designed to
take advantage of the fact that I'm a plate class; many clerics -aren't-
played this way, but that doesn't mean its not part of the class capabilities.

CHeal versus Celestial (still the best heal in the game at 52) and Remedy
is a tactical decision clerics have to juggle all the time.  Heroic Bond
is another interesting choice there, by the way, like using single target HP
buffs at low levels as a heal, more mana efficient, lower taunt, and keeps
the buff up all at the same time.  Course that's only an interesting approach
if you have a full group and at least most of it is taking some damage... like
after pulling an AOE mob.

Root parking mobs does indeed mean that if the mob isn't taken care of
it will be coming for you... but just like a chanter, a cleric can happily
re-root that mob again and again if need be.  If the mob is really
a pain, the cleric can root it further away and then atone, end of issue.
Rooting is hardly expensive, root costs 30 mana, and healing someone
who faced that add for long enough to kill the first one is certainly
going to take more mana than that.  Also, if mana is an ongoing problem
for your cleric then you need to look at your group composition, I'm
more often than not working in the top 30% of my mana bar continuously
unless something goes badly wrong... have to work it that way so I'll
have the mana to cover those disasters.

Root breaks, mob goes for the cleric... having pointed out that I
can take a beating, why is this a problem?  Heck, you are used to
letting the chanter take a beating, and there are mobs out there
that can out-damage their HP total in under 20 seconds.  Same
mob on a cleric gives you about a minute to deal with the problem,
if for some reason the cleric can't handle himself, and the cleric is
also sitting on DA, which gives him an extra 18 seconds and (nowadays)
loses the aggro if there's anyone else on the hate list.  DA isn't a plan,
of course, its only a backup plan... but "cleric can't handle it himself"
isn't that frequent occurance.
