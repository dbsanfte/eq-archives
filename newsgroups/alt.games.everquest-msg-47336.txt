I'm happy to hear that you didn't have easy access to human, although
it seems that despite such precautions everyone that discusses the matter
is working on making human into the defacto common anyway.    At
least they -tried- to make languages interesting.  If they made it so that
NPCs only spoke certain languages, they might have something... did
they?

100 is the absolute cap for languages.  50 is adequate for communication
purposes, you can in fact understand someone with a 25 skill if you
are decent at reading between the typos... but at 50 you can actually
chat.

My current characters haven't bothered with languages, but on my
last account my main had about 15 maxed and a running start on
several more.  Of course that was in an environment where you could
gain more than one point per hour... in fact it took about half
an hour to -max- a language from zero skill.

I recall a language that would qualify as the evil common, dark
speech I think it is called; presumably ogres, trolls, and dark
elves will all have easy access to that, and perhaps necromancers
and shadowknights of other races.
