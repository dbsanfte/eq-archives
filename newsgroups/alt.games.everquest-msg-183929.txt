Let me enumerate a few skills:

1) Keeping cool in a stessful situation. When a mob is beating on you,
you don't flail your arms around and run around like a Cockatrice.

2) There is an art to pulling, esp with a bow. I often use stun (Pally
Stun) for pulls, becuase is gives me a little time to see what is
really coming.

3) Knows what tools to bring isn't just knowing what to do, how to do
it is a skill. Two Enchanters can bring two different loadouts, and
accomplish very different roles in a party.

4) Knowing what the other members can/should/will/wont do is a skill.
This is close to one of your exclusions, but I think it is what makes
a good player great!
