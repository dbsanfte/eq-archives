It's the exact same situation. Aggemammon was making his requests
within a small slice of time, but that small slice doesn't exist in a
vacuum. It's part of a much bigger picture - one in which Druids are
frequently subject to people begging or demanding SoW.

And his perception of what the druids were doing is irrelevant - he
cannot know what they actually were doing. The druid may be sitting on
the ground, but the person operating him may be letting the dog out,
or feeding the baby, or answering a phone call, or any of countless
similar things.

You appear to be attributing that attitude to the general druid
population, utterly without supporting evidence. Certainly you can't
draw the "uber" conclusion from the cases Aggemammon cited.

Wow, you sure are clever.
