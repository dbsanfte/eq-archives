Defensive is worthless on VS, because the danger isn't in his damage, it is
the lifetaps, which hit full force regardless of defensive. Any ability
which absolutely prevents you from being hit is good, but since riposte
lets you hit back, that is even better. Plus, 9 seconds or so is about how
long an ideal VS fight should take.
