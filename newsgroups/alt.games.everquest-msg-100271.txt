    Depends how they did it. If levelling only got you HPs and the intrinsic
benefits of levelling, it would help re-balance the game in spots. Right now
people can plow through low blues like they're nothing at level 60. What
happens when those folks start to level up, and have to find new mobs to
kill, tougher mobs? "I don't get XP from it unless it can summon" - imagine
THAT change to EQ.

    They'd still have to make sure that levelling didn't make encounters too
easy because of spell resists and intrinsic chance to hit (they could cap
these in the code at level 60), but I'm sure this change could be done so
uber-characters weren't soloing all of upper Sebilis for XP. The real
question is "would that be the straw that breaks the camel's back" in terms
of retaining folks....
