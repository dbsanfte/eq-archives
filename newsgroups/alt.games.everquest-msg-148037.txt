Yes, I have Luclin, in fact in my post I explain that my other character has
no problem gating to GD.  The problem is that I have one character on my
account that for some strange reason CAN NOT gate or port into GD.  When I
try to take the spires from Luclin to GD it ports everyone else, but
transfers me to the center of the Nexus and tells me that the zone is down.
When I try to gate there, it simply leaves me behind.  I tried having a
Wizzy friend gate me and it deposited me right outside of the entrance to
Paludal Caverns.  Either way, it simply will NOT take me to Great Divide.
As I said, at least one other character (the only one I've tried, all others
are much too low level) had no problem being gated there.

This has been going on for some time, but the first few times I tried it, I
thought the zone really was down.  It was not a big problem before, but this
character is almost 40 and she will need to be able to go to GD.  If no one
has any suggestions I guess I'll be up early Monday morning to be first in
line to customer service.  O Well
