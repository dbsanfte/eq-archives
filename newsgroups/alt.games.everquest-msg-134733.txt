Hmm ? Let me see , I'm a moron because as a casual player I have a life
outside of EQ. Unlike other players who surf the web, spend more time on EQ
than with friends and family. I wonder if you two, lost and/or quit your
jobs, still have a girlfriend/wife, know who your children are, are doing
your epics, read the websites and boards to see what items you can gather,
amassed huge amounts of cash in the bank, camp the Life of Aegis or Pyzjn
for weeks at a time, and have totally forgotten .. ITS a FRIGGIN GAME !
