There are a couple of ways this can be done...
Since you said that the HD doesnt have files here is a question.... has XP
been installed on it?  What OS did your old HD have?  If it was not XP then
the easiest way to convert it would be to copy the data you wish to save
onto your newer HD (keeping the older HD as a slave).  Then reformat the
older HD with XP.  XP will ask you if you wish to convert to NTFS or not.
