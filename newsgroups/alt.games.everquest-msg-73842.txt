Hi Wylbur,  I guess I'll just go in the order you ask..

While not knocked over with awe, I did enjoy the film.  If the
generalization stands that the book is better then the movie, I should enjoy
the book even more; I think I will read it.

Ok, so I guess my next answer will lump all this into one question.  Like
you (but probably more-so) I was equating lotr to eq.. while not
intentionally, it was likely my subconcious doing it's job after being jaded
of decades of fantasy films where the wizards always shoot fireballs,
lightning bolts etc.

As for giving Tolkien the respect he deserves -- I can almost assuredly say
I do not.  I wasn't aware these books existed before the movie came out,
even when initially watching the previews on tv I thought to myself, "oh
that looks interesting, I'd like to see it" but still having zero knowledge
about the books or the universe which Tolkien brought to life.  To be
honest, I don't imagine I still understand what he has created or the
repercussions his books had on fantasy as a whole.  For this, I will have to
read the books before I can truely understand how in depth they are and
until such time I don't think I will know what the "fuss" :)  is about.

Cheers!
