If I was starting over, I would join an old server with a high population
because the world is now big enough that a server could easily support 3000
players at a time and because items will be cheaper in general because of
more deflation.  Joining a newer server no longer has an advantage as even
the newest one probably has a ton of level 60s and uberguilds while the low
population is now a disadvantage because the world is much larger than it
was.
