I disagree with that one. Eating an unrezzed death always felt like a
waste to me and I usually went out of my way to avoid it. ... which
meant that (for my playstyle), where I hunted was often dependent on
whether there was a rez available or not.

I don't see that as a 'reasonable' option. One of the (few) things I
liked about PoP was the graveyards because it let me push the envelope
and just see how far into a zone we could get before wiping and at
worst you'd know that your corpse would pop at the zone line in about
15 minutes.
