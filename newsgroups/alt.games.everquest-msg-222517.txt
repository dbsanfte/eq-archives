Try turning down most of the crap thathogs those resources.  I know
you;d have to log out to turn off hi-res models, social animations,
etc, but on your machine that shouldn't take more than a minute.

Also, go into options in game and shut off particle effects and sound,
and set your clip plane down to nothing (if you don't already in the
bazaar).   These are some of the things likely to make your machine
chug.
