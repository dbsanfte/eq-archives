Well I have to jump in here sometime so here we go...

I have to agree with most of the posters here that CS is broken in a big 
way.  I have had 3 quests in the past week that are bugged and I can not 
complete them.  Each time I have petitioned and tell them in great detail 
what happened.  After that each time I have sent in a bug report.  I can 
live with this whole mess up to this point because I have played EQ and EQ2 
long enough to know that it is a work in progress and things happen.  I am 
totally cool with getting a reply to the effect " thanks for bringing this 
to our attention and we will get it fixed as soon as possible".  Even if it 
took them a couple months to fix it I would still be fine with it because as 
least they are owning up to the fact that there is something wrong.

When you get a reply that looks like a generic autoreply that does not even 
mention the problem you have and instead points to the probability that you 
are at fault due to your ignorance of the game or lack attention to detail, 
that is what makes me mad.  Today I had another quest that won't count right 
(wholesaler task that only counts every third or fourth item I collect) and 
instead of sending a petition that described the problem, I made the first 
line of the petition a partial description of the problem and then made the 
next 4 lines of the petition a comment on how it is hard to solve a problem 
if you never even read the thing to begin with.  If a real human had read 
this they would have gotten my point immediately.

Predictably, I got a reply that had the same scripted answer as always.  I 
was not collecting the right item as some items are average or sullied and 
so on.  I have never seen a sullied electrum cluster but who knows, maybe I 
am the one who is wrong.  It would just be refreshing to get a real person 
to reply instead of that crap they offer now.  I would even be willing to 
pay an extra fee (maybe .50 per petition) if a real person could give me a 
straight answer.  I am just frustrated with the system they offer now to 
resolve problems.

Along with that, it would be nice for CS to be able to actually try to offer 
you something to make up for the trouble.  I spent 30 minutes on the quest I 
can't complete this last time.  Imagine what it would feel like if the reply 
was " sorry the quest you were assigned is not working correctly (after 
trying to resolve the problem by reading the knowledge base), and we will 
reset the quest so that you can collect a different item that can be 
completed.  Oh, and here are 3 of the new item you have to collect to make 
up for the 3 old item you spent that time collecting.  It is not a free hand 
out, it is being fair.

They rake in millions of dollars a month from us.  They need to put a real 
system in place to work these issues.  I know of several corporations that 
offer individual service that smokes SOE that have a similar customer base 
so it is possible.  They have to get their act together because MMORPGs are 
more popular than ever and there is bound to be a lot more competition.

comments please.....
