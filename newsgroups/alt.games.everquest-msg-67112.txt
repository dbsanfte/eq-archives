I could use some help on getting the Karana deity items made.  I don't know
much about them & havent been able to find anything on the net that is
really informative.

Here is what I have so far:

I know that an imbued plains pebble combined with enchanted gold makes an
earring +4wis, +2sta, -3str.  Can only be worn by Karana worshippers.  Cost
me about 40p to get a pair made.  Enchanters, for some reason, only have
been wanting to charge me for the gold.  I still have been paying them about
2x that so they don't feel taken advantage of.  Besides, it's a good deal
for me, too :o)

I have read somewhere that if I get a grand master smithy to do a mace with
an imbued plains pebble that I get a good 1h basher that is also
Karana-only.

I have a whisper about some Karana-wear, but I dont know how to get it
tailored.

The questions that I have are:  do I have to have a human forge my magic
basher?  This is something I have been told in game, but have been unable to
substantiate.  I really need a magic weapon because I am still bronzing the
mobs with the mace I got off a Derv at level 13 (& I'm 37 now).

Any other information you might have about any of the Karana-wear would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Clem
