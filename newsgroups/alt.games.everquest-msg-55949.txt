1. What are the 4 numbers, includind two percentages, in the corner of the
screen? I think that the leftmost is the ping. Am I right?What are the
others?

2. A mesh cape given to me is magic. What does that mean? The description
does not say.

3. Is there a web site that explains all the abbreviations that players use
in the game?

Thanks.
