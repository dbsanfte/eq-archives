The effects of CHA on mezzing are still being debated.  Most people say
there's no difference, and the tests that have been done are inconclusive.

Verant did not mention mezzing in their explanation of what CHA does, just
charm.

Most enchanters try to get each as high as possible, with INT taking
priority.  I have a 245 INT and a 206 CHA, for example.
