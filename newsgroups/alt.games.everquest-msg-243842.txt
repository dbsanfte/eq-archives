Dragon's are impractical... in most fantasies, they do not live in
community - and certainly wouldn't build a city...

besides, they take up SO much room... the lag would be awful... and since
they're not humanoid, all of the weapon and armor drops would not
'naturally' fit... so they'd have to make an entire suite of weapons and
armor (both drops and tradeskillable) for dragons to utilize.

Also, as a critter, they're too powerful... can you imagine the newbie
gardens?  No other race could step foot in them when they are of an
equivalent level.

Gnolls, Goblins, and Orcs (as prev. stated, I favor gnolls) are more obvious
choices, as they are humanoid, wear and use tools that other races also use,
live in community, and have similar classes (casters, warriors, pet classes,
etc)
