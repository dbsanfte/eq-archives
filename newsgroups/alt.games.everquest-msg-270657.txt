This is mostly the reasons that I chose WoW over EQ2 as well, but I wanted 
to add a couple of items. Locked encounters, EQ2 means you can't help 
people, WoW means the NPC is locked and you can't KS it, but you can help. 
This can potentially lead to PL'ing, if the newbie can damage the NPC, if 
the newbie can't then they can't lock it. Also there is some xp loss if the 
killing group does not do over 50%, not alot but a little (at least in the 
testing my wife and I have done). Also you left off the no zoning (well 
unless you are porting across the world), this is huge, doing quests in EQ2 
"feels" like 50% of the time I am zoning in and out of places. Lastly I 
think the WoW world is just more diverse, dwarves have an interesting 
progression through lands to hunt in that is different from the humans that 
is different from the elves. Sure you can move to any of the others, but it 
still gives you 3 choices of areas to progress through.
Grouping in both were pretty much just get together do this quest break up, 
at least in my experiences.
