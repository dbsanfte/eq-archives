No it is not funny. A potted plant would be a better president than either.

Bush is no bean counter either... and i think his hard sciences rivals 
that of an 8th grader, if that.

There are many countries that are far more socialist than the US that 
are getting along just fine... including Canada & much of Europe.

And I fully support the removal of George W. Bush... fortunately for 
America I do not have an army capable of smashing the entire country to 
pieces to get him, nor would I have any inclination to smash the entire 
country to pieces even if such an army was available.

In view of America's hypocritical lip-service to human rights this is 
laughable. As the saying goes "Pull the Log out of your own eye before 
pointing at the sliver in someone elses."

There is no shortage of extreme poverty, crime including murder & rape, 
not to mention state sanctioned executions going on in your own 
backyard. Perhaps the country is due for a little introspection.

Nah... its easier to distract everyone from the problems at home by 
keeping the news full of wealthy foreign terrorists that need to be 
bombed (and sacked).

Semantics.

Funny how when its innocent Iraqis its 'minimal collateral damage'. When 
its innocent americans (or even soldiers) its 'terrorism'.

More semantics.

They are prisoners of war, untried, unconvicted, and innocent until 
proven guilty of any crime. Since when does the idea of inalienable 
human rights stop with non-American humans??

You watch too much TV.

Getting a reputation for mass summary executions preceeded by sessions 
with hot pokers is not going to lead to the mass surrenders that you 
have largely enjoyed.

You want to incite them to dig in, fight to the death, launch 
counterstrikes instead of surrenders, incite terrorism, cause your 
allies to recoil in horror & withdraw support, and push those nations 
unsympathetic with you but uninvolved in the conflict into an all out 
war to stop the out of control American terrorists -- go ahead start 
murdering everybody in sight.

That will undoubtably cost you many more of your 'fellow American 
soldiers' than you would have dreamed possible, not to mention bring 
full scale 'collateral damage' into the heart of America so you can see 
up close what 'collateral damage' looks like. I think you'll find it 
looks exactly the same as 'terrorism'.
