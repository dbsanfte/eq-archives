I've adventured with Lollador, he's a good player. I don't recall him
pulling, but I'd have no problem if he wanted to: I've had any number of
classes pull well because the person behind the tune is a focused, smart
adult. Take that over the classic teenage-nitwit tank any ol' day.

I think in the situation Annie described, I'd have done exactly as she did.
In fact I have!


P.S. Half my /ignore list is tanks and I'll wager a mortgage check that
their average age is 15. My 11-year-old son who now adventures with his
druid calls me over to the computer: "Dad! Look at what this dumb tank is
doing now!!".

P.P.S. Flame-retardant disclaimer: there are plenty of terrific players
running warriors, pallies and SKs, some of my best EQ friends are tanks,
etc.

P.P.P.S. Hey Adam, what's your main on Saryrn? Have we adventured?
