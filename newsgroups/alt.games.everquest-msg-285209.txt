EQ isn't that demanding of video cards anymore, compared to current non-MMO
games.  I'd imagine any modern laptop with a dedicated graphics chip should be
able to handle it.

Nope.  Depending on what video card's in your desktop, and how cheap you go on
the laptop, you're likely to improve all aspects of performance by going to a
new laptop.

Yup.  EQ plays adequately (zoning sucks, crowded zones and raids are painful,
and patching is unbelievably annoying) on dialup, and almost all hotspots are
faster than that by quite a bit.
