Lots of people have that "feeling", but so far nobody's done any tests.  As
a data point, my jewelry skill is 250.  I've never paid any attention to
DEX.  It stays around 100, and I have a 80-90 percent success rate on
non-trivial stuff.

According to EQ Traders, the ONLY thing that governs success rate is your
skill level at the trade in question.  This is direct from Yak, the trade
skill guy at Verant.

This also directly contradicts an earlier statement by Yak that INT/WIS -do-
have an effect on success.

One brave soul on the EQ Traders forums tested this by getting as drunk as
he possibly could, and then succeeded making 13 velium fire opal rings in a
row, so I'm thinking that stats don't have any effect on success.

I used to max out my INT before making stuff, even after I had maxed my
skill.  Now I don't bother, and haven't noticed any rise in my failure rate.
