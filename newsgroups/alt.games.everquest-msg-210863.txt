Actually, I bind wounds back up to 50%, and go pull another.  I expect 
that to stop in another level or so.  Maybe if I actually get a haste 
item for him, I can do it a while longer.

And before you start crying twink, he is in a mixture of bronze and 
crafted armor, and a skull shaped barbute, and, as I said, no haste item 
at all.  His weapons are an Ebon Razor in primary, and some other lesser 
weapon.

In general though, if what you want to do is solo, don't play a warrior, 
they suck at it compared to many other classes.
