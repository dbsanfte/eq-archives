Unless, of course, you decide to renounce your evil ways, and join the
forces of good instead.  If you want to play a good class, you'll just
have to accept that Freeport can't help you, and the Qeynosians are
going to take some convincing.

I think this is a good thing, and I don't think it breaks the
archetype system.  Factions were a great idea that was squandered in
Everquest, and I'm hoping they'll make good use of them in EQ2.  It
would be more interesting if there were more factions, though.

As I've said before, this one has me stumped, as well.
