Once you complete the first few quests for the warrior class and get "promoted"
to recruit, what then?  I got sent to some armsman and was told to show him my
buckler, which I did.  He gave it back along with a dusty bag and said he'd help
me with my next lesson, but never said what that was.  Does anyone know what
comes next?  Or am I on my own?
