I've got the black bits largely removed and have catalogued everything but
the sogbone skels, and the behemoth, and them only because they looked too
nasty to get near, so it's not like i haven't looked. I've been all around
that keep without finding a solo, and when i shouted in zone was told that
people fought the ones near bb instead for that quest.

However, najena crashed again tonight, so it'll have to wait for tomorrow at
least.
