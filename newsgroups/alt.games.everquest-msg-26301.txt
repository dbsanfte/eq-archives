Heh. I wouldn't know how to *single* kite to save my life. For every mob
I've killed in my career, more than half the damage I have done has been
sheer melee, unless it's one of those "Shit! A caster! NUKE NUKE NUKE
NUKE" situations.

I just bought an Icepaw War Claw, and with it I'm back to being able to
melee two blues in a row, so I'm a pretty happy camper. I know the fun
won't last, though. =)

Don't get me wrong, I'd *love* to see some of those high-level areas,
since being a tourist is by far the most pleasurable experience I get
out of EQ, after helping people (OTOH, I really don't care about the
Epic weapon. I've seen a lot more Druids with it than with my claws, so
the "uniqueness" part is already taken care of. Besides, since getting
the Epic or not depends entirely on the capability of your guild, there
is very little in the way of pride in a personal achievement to be had).

Realistically, I'll probably stop levelling this character at 35. Beyond
that, I don't seem to get any really new spells, just rehashes of the
old ones. At that point, I'll bring my enchanter back into active duty,
or move to the RP server if it's up at the time.
