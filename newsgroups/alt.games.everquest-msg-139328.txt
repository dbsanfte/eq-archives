I don't see your point here.

Person A lists DE for 7000.

Person B lists it for 300

The 300pp one sold.

Now only the 7000pp one is available.  Perhaps someone will
buy it at that price.

Who is the idiot?

The guy listing at 7000?  Well he may be overly optomistic, but
he didn't have any competition when he listed... or if he listed
second, had a reasonable expectation that his competition would
rapidly vanish.

You?  You bought a DE for 300pp, unless you think thats too
high, this doesn't make you an idiot.

The guy listing at 300?  Well that was enough for him, and he
made a sale quick.  Doesn't sound like an idiot (unless vendors
pay more than 300 for a DE that is, but if so you didn't mention
the fact)

IF someone had purchased the 7000 one while the 300pp one
was available you'd have a point.

If this was the old EC/auction channel deal, then the guy listing at
7000pp might as well shut up till the 300 pp one is done.  But
now that we can turn on trader and go AFK overnight, heck,
putting a higher price in than your competition isn't all that dumb
after all.

If he sells it, he's a happy camper, don't you think?
