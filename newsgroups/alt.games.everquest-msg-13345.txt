I have noticed that sometimes when I port in to a place (especially
WC) I will take falling damage a couple of times if someone is
standing directly on the TP "spawn" point.  The screen shakes like an
earthquake is happening, and I take quite a bit of damage, depending
on the race of the guy underneath me.  Barbarians seem to cause the
most damage, but I suspect a bigger race would cause more.  I didn't
notice if I was encumbered when I TP'ed in, though I suspect that
might have something to do with it.

Has anyone ever died because someone was just standing around on the
TP point?  Talk about a shitty way to die...
