No, I've never heard of Ran. I never watch that trite dog and pony
show called the "acadamy awards", either. My favorite movies are often
the ones that the critics tear apart, flop in the box office, and win
no awards. I don't watch movies because some stuffy art critic tells
me it's good, I watch them because they look interesting. Even if the
acting is bad and the script poorly written, the story could be good.
That's all that really matters to me when it comes down to it.
