It appears to be fixed for me now, also, after copying my UI over from a 
second machine.  But the patch itself didn't appear to help me in any way 
(unless it somehow fixed the problem on my laptop but not my desktop where I 
primarily play).  Simply deleting and recreating UI's on the original box 
didn't help.  Uninstalling, deleting the EQ2 directory and reinstalling 
didn't help... but copying the UI over from an entirely different box did.

Very... odd.  But hey, it seems to have worked.
