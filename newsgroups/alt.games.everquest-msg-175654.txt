At low levels it is pretty meaningless.  I think it's 1 hitpoint per 5
stamina per level.  So, at level 50, 10 stamina is 100 extra hp.  If you put
25 points into stamina rather than somewhere else, that's 250 extra hp at
level 50.  While not a huge amount, it does help.  Strength does affect your
ATK, so is worthwhile, but, it is really easy to raise STR with items that
you will want to wear due to their AC anyway.  Stamina is much harder to
raise.
