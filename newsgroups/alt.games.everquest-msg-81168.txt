There's more to being a redneck than racism.  Or did I miss Rev. King's
condemnation of trucks with big tires and gun racks?  You seem as prejudiced
against rednecks as you accuse all of them of being against racial
minorities.

1)  Incest, pedophilia, and rape are not natural.
2)  Abortion only thwarts one natural process, the birth of a human being.
3)  I fail to see how a woman's right to choose justifies slaughtering an
innocent child.  Her right to choice is in the decision to engage in an
activity that has been demonstrated to result in pregnancy.
4)  How about the child's right to choose whether or not it lives.  Does the
fact that she cannot be seen make the child's rights somehow less?
5)  How does this relate to rednecks?  Surely, people other than rednecks
think abortion is murder, and certainly there are some rednecks who have no
problem with abortion.  Perhaps you are unfairly singling out a group...
what's the term for that?

Odd, most of the rednecks I know tend not to engage in said activities.  Are
you sure you're not just full of crap?

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
