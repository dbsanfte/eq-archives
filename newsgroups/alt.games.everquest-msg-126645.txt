 Yeah that bugs me too. I created a loot hotkey. I wasn't able to figure
out how to target a corpse through a macro key so I have to hit U first
then the Loot macro (/loot). It would be nice to have it all in one key
press. It would also be nice to set windows as invisible, other than the
title bar, so that you can click through them.
