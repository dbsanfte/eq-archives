I get horrible lag also in the games.I don't think it's your dial up
either.I'm on cable and it's bad.I wouldn't call
my system slow either.I'm running a 200mhz fsb with an Nforce2 Asus
m\board,Radeon 9700,AMD@2gig
and 512 of PC3200.IF you get lag and slowdown on a system like that then it
has to be the game.
All the best.
