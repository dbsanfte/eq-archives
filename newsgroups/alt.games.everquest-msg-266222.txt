>I used to come here under a different name.  What it was, I don't even

Translated: I am a putz and have my balls kicked repeatedly every time I 
post here so need to keep changing nicks.

> stopped playing in August of 2003 and for some reason came back to this NG

> I was.

Translated: My balls are still aching from being excluded from the A.G.E 
community so I come back occasionally on a different name in a pathetic 
attempt be accepted this time round.

> This post is not meant to be a rant against people who play this game, 
> just wondering *why* you still play this game.

Translation: "This post IS a rant against people who play this game but I am 
going to say isn't in a transparent attempt to seem less pathetic"

> This game is very addicting. Will I be someone on TV saying "This game is

Translation: "I have a problem with addiction therefore everyone else must 
have as well."

>  Anyway, I wish you all the best of luck.  Just give me a reason why you

Translation: "Eat shit and die, all of you"

> Lastly,  Bizbee...if you are still on here.  You are a complete asshole.

Translation: "Bizbee made me cry last time I posted here. Mommee - please 
make the bad man stop!"
