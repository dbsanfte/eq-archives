When you see a monster, click on it ( target it ), and hit the letter "C" 
( /con ) and see what "color" it is.  In general, this is how they rate:

Green  - Lower level than aqua - most won't give you EXP
Aqua   - Lower level than blue
Blue   - Lower level than you
White  - Same level are you
Yellow - 1-2 levels higher than you
Red    - 3 levels higher than you

Thie higher it is, usually the harder it is to kill and the faster it will 
kill you.

Click on an NPC ( the guys who aren't trying to kill you ) and hit the "h" 
key to hail them.  Talk to them.  Some give quests.

Go to your key-mappings and move the auto-attack off of the letter "a" to 
another key that you won't hit on accident.

Be nice to people, and they will be nice to you.  When you talk to people, 
spell your words out and use complete sentences.

Loot every corpse ( right-click on it ) and sell the crap you loot.  Some 
stuff is for quests, so you may want to look at web sites to find out what 
to keep or figure it out for yourself if you want it to be more fun.

Get some containers.  Right now, you can only hold 8 things.  Get 8 
containers for the bank and maybe a couple for your character to carry 
around.  Monks have weight limits so watch that.

Don't be an asshole.

List what server you are on, and what race you are.  If you are a decent 
person, people will be willing to help.
