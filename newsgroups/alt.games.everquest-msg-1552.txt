As a Magician, I know all about this.  I also have a couple hotkeys
made for just such a thing.  Whenever I summon something, I use a no
rent hotkey that tells them that it will disappear when they log or if
they go linkdead.  I have a button just for the no rent bags I summon
that also tells them anything inside the bags will go too.

I have a 55 STR, so I use the dimensional pockets all the time (4 of
them and 4 permanent bags).  I just use them to hold things like rusty
weapons that weigh a lot, but I won't worry about too much if I go LD.
I put the lighter stuff (cloth armor, cb belts) and stuff I really want
to keep in the permanent bags.  This keeps me from being encumbered all
the time (easy to do with such a weenie strength) and I don't lose
anything worthwhile if the bags go poof.

That being said, I had one night where I went link dead several times.
Besides that, I've only had it happen a small handful of times in the
several months I've played EQ.  So, it's not as big a worry for me as
it is for other people with connectivity issues.  My biggest loss was
my own fault.  I forgot to empty my dimensional pockets before
camping.  Oops!  I knew better - I just forgot.
