Are you thick or somehow blinded by your hatred?  He was explaining a 
MYTH, not an opinion.  I despise people like you, regardless of your 
'color' because you fail to actually READ what is in front of you, but 
rather jump to a conclusion based upon your 'psychic abilities' to read 
the mind of the writer and assume you somehow know that he means it in a 
different way than what he actually wrote.  :P

It is, in a way, actually quite humourous, but rather pathetic.
