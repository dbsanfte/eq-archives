I talk about the good ones as well. But bringing up the bad is just human
nature nothing unique about Verant or EQ here. I once heard that
on average that when people have a good experience they tell 3 people
about it on average. If they had a bad experience they tell 11 people on
average. Seems to me to be even more incentive to make sure your
CS is up to par.

Plus 6 hours is a bit much. It just happened to be at the beginning of
my play time, what if it was later in the night and I had to log off in an
hour?

Because all they had to do was restore my character from a back up.
That is what back ups are for. When I finally got to actually TALK to
the lead GM it was fixed. When I finally GOT TO HIM. All the other
bullshit in the way is way too much red tape to fix a simple glitch in
their program.

As I said all I needed was a restore from back up. If that takes longer
that a few minutes then they need to get a better back up system.
