Shrug. I still play, but I already feel sad for what EQ used to
be to me. I look back at old screenshots and I remember a real
feeling of friendship, fun, community, love with people. I think
about it now and its... raiding. People I barely know. No....

frivolity.

And I dont *want* to re-engage with EQ in the same way, I dont want
to make it such a focus of my life again, but I still miss the
rewards from the time it was a genuine social engagement rather
than just a replacement for TV in killing time.

It makes me a little sad. In both senses of the term ;)
