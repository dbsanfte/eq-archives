Ok I just dinged 46 yesterday and I'm thinking of taking a look into the
planes...At least after I get a death buffer up. Anyone know of any decent
online guides or anything on quests required for progression etc. I've found
a few on the armor quests but other than that not much. I know flags are
required for advancement but have no idea of the order or who, what, you
have to kill to get flagged. Any links or insight would be greatly
appreciated. Thanks.
