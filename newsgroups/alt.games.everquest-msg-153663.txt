Cleric Epic. She was in SF and ran over to help me out. I was right
there, close to the SF zone into OT. I was offered a 50 and she
offered a Epic Rez, I guess thats 96, and not 97.

It was not a necro, I didn't know necros got a 97 rez.

Nope I remembered wrong. My log got turned off I discovered with the
new UI. I havent had it on for weeks and I won't be turning it on
unless I have a problem.

Ouch. I read your stuff on here with interest. It hurts a little to
get slapped by someone who you think has good opinions.

You either are calling me a liar, or saying that I guild with idiots.
Neither case is true. How about I am not a cleric, and I got a detail
wrong?

You seem like a good guy, and thats the only reason I did not blow off
your opinion. I guess you have had a bad day, otherwise you wouldn't
be flaming over a small detail.
