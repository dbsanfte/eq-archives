Yes, a very valid point.  The majority of the time I either solo/duo,
because there are too many clueless twinks/powerlevelled characters
around now.  The cluelessness has reached incredible heights with the
Monster Mission grinding, too.

Very true.  He gets labelled a lot, but that often says more about the
people who try to label him than it does about bizbee himself.  He
doesn't suffer fools and the "Politically Correct" gladly, but I'm
with him as regards that anyway.  I just don't express it in the
colourful terms he sometimes does  ;)
