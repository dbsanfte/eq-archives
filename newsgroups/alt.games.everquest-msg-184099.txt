Then typing (at any speed) is a skill. Communicating in English takes
months, if not years, of practice. Using a mouse takes practice (really!).
Fast reaction time takes practice. Memorizing reams of information (spell
lists, tradeskill recipes, mob abilities, game jargon, zone layout) takes
practice. Organizing all the information you aren't interested in memorizing
takes practice. Dealing socially with others takes practice. In-game
techniques take practice, from something as "simple" as navigating a zone
via landmarks, Sense Heading, and /loc, to something as complicated as FD
pulling 1 caster from a crowd of 3 others.
                  
My gut feeling is that you are overlooking skills because you've mastered
them and therefore, don't want to consider them as skills any more. A
paradox: those who have mastered TicTacToe know the algorithm for picking
winning moves. *You* would probably prefer to think of these people as
just having "nitpicky knowledge" and not skill. But at one point, they
were learning the game, didn't know the winning moves, and were improving
their game through practice. So at that point, by your definition, TicTacToe
was a skill for them. What's wierd is that they improved to the point where
their skill ceased being a skill?? It's this phenomenon which I think is
responsible for why you think using a mouse effectively, or knowing what
to expect from the different classes at different levels doesn't count as
a skill.

Enchanters, bards, druids with snare+sow, mage with earth pet, beastlords
with flash of light, and others, will all have totally different experiences 
and techniques for what they can handle and how they handle them...

Therein lies the crux of the biscuit... If you follow a recipe for FD
pulling and I don't, does that make it a skill for me but not for you?
Perhaps whether something qualifies as a skill or not isn't absolute?

It's also an enchanter technique, nyah, nyah! The Enchanters of DOOOOOOOOM!
web page states you can't be an Enchanter of DOOOOOOOOM! until you've swarm
kited the Oasis spectres. I'm not an Enchanter of DOOOOOOOOM! yet :)
I have no doubt that same techniques would allow (for example) druids to
swarm kite snow cougars, or necros to swarm kite undead even.

For my part, your definition of "skill" is okay for purposes of this
discussion, it's just not a definition I find terribly useful. But I'm
(likely) unusual in that I'm comfortable with explicitly fuzzy word
definitions.
