Well, I chatted with a TSR last night, and while he did acknowledge that I 
had never before been charged this tax (right, newsflash, why did he think 
I was there?), the best he could offer for an explanation was that my state 
is evidently one that requires such a tax be charged. He advised me to 
confirm it with my local tax authority. Probably not a bad idea. I walked 
away with little more information than I had to begin with, unfortunately. 
Well, I did find out that SoE does not consider this to be any sort of 
billing error.

Perhaps SoE is just now deciding to start charging me what they should have 
been charging me all along. At $.90 it's not much, but it does effectively 
qualify as yet another increase in the cost required to play an aging game. 

It was $9.99 when I started.
It was raised to $12.99 a few years ago.
It was again raised to $14.99 within the past year.
Now I'm at $15.89.

It's nothing that will cause me to quit playing at this point, but I have 
begun to rethink the merits of running my second account. I hope they know 
what they're doing.
