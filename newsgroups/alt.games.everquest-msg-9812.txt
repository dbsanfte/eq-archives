    Oh dear, that WOULD be bad now. Many zones are already empty because
"you can't get a group there, nobody goes there". If the server population
dipped further, then most of the outlying areas would empty out, and the
crowded zones would become even more so. Players who didn't want to be LFG
for life would start solo classes, and the game would go in the exact
opposite direction that I think Verant intends it to go in.
