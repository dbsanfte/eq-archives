Y'know, it's funny... I got an unidentified email the other day
(unidentified as in, I didn't recognize the name of the sender). 
Attached was a document that the sender pleaded for me to open. I'm
not saying it was you, but I guarantee it was someone here.  I
expected as much; I'm not at all surprised by it.  I do however want
to say... whoever is stupid enough (I can't emphasize the word
"stupid" enough) to send it, probably assumed that I was as stupid as
them... who the hell would send a virus from a university-based email
system with their name for all to see?  I find it more laughable than
offensive...
You'll have to do better than that you fuckin' moron!
