OK, of those listed that you say require a full group I know guildmates
who solo in Charsis, Chardok, Umbral, Sebilis, The Hole, Siren's Grotto,
Maiden's Eye, Velks, and Fungus Grove.  I see that 6 of those are on
Norrath, which isn't too bad.
In addition certain classes can solo KC, Burning Woods, Skyfire Mtns,
Skyshire, Wakening Land, Kael, Western Wastes, Sol B, and Lower Guk.  
That's 9 more zones on Norrath.  I'm sure there are other zones that 
soloer know about, plus the other solo spots on the moon.

They already have AA points.  That will keep most people going for a long, 
long time.  I certainly hope they continue to add more 50+ dungeons, 
especially if they are dungeons designed for crawling rather than camping.  
The fact of the matter is that the high-end players by and large like 
dungeons.  The majority of the players group regularly, and Verant is 
working to keep the majority happy.  There is NO lack of content for 
groups to 60, and I suspect that there isn't a lack of content for soloers 
to 60 either.
