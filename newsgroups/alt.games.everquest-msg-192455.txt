An SK pet is free damage for as long as you stay in zone and can keep him
alive. It can stun casters and interrupt spells going off. It might hold
off a tough mob long enough for you to escape. It can be used to eat a
enemy SK's harmtouch rather cheaply.

Among the downsides are that pet management takes a while to learn,
especially if you're meleeing and casting spells at the same time. It's
hard to keep him alive if you get adds. It's hard to be puller for a group
and prevent your pet from screwing up the pull. And since your pet is
roughly *half* your SK's level, your pet will sometimes cause you to get
annoying green adds that otherwise would have left you alone.

It's definitely a tradeoff. I would recommend summoning your pet even when
grouped, if for no other reason than practice. You'll never get better at
handling pets in a group if you don't do it. If you find later that it's
too much of a hassle, at least you can make an informed decision on whether
the particulars of your camp make your pet desirable or not.

With my 30 DE SK, I almost always have pet up, even when grouped. But while
hunting in Warrens, for example, I was much better off without him (even
soloing!) because of adds.
