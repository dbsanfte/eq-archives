I have a p3 800 MHz and for the patch had a fresh install of XP with nvidia
Gforce 2. I downloaded latest drivers for Soundblaster Live 5.1 although
they give sever distortion still.  I am basically stuck since every time I
zone or am ported I go LD. In addidtion my char stays active for about 15
mins so a simple trip from ec to fp is an evening activity. In addition I
often LD anyway and often get "you have been disconnected" at the char
select screen. I have done 3 installs of eq and sol. I have tried both
nvidia drivers. I have tried disabling the soundcard. I have tried making
new chars.  Basically when I start the game and enter password the loading
screen shows a bleed through of my windows desktop.  The modem icon flashes
through and even can sometimes be seen over the run/walk button in game. If
I am lucky enough to get into the game, I have monumental lag where I lose
packets. I had a pretty simple machine with me before this SOL upgrade.  I
had eq and office 2000. period. no other games or programs or devices.
After the upgrade failed I have bought 3 other games to occupy myself and to
test my system since the requirements were so similiar to EQ. Castle
Wolfenstein runs flawless on the machine. nice graphics and no issues.
Shougun - warlord edition also runs perfectly. Dark Age of Camelot runs
perfect - I have had probably 2 disconnects in 20 hours of play ( much less
than EQ on Win ME). All these are nice games and pretty graphics - but I
would like to play my 42 wizard in EQ. But a constant LD just does not work.
I took the EQ page of requirements to my tech and had him make my machine
meet the recommened specs or better.  Then 2 weeks and no experience and
only a bunch of guesses at what the problem might be. EQ Tech sends a form
letter out - chat is full/ busy - My tech not a gamer and says system is
working perfectly. I would appreciate any clues as to what it might be.
Thanks.
Jim
