I fail to see how this is fair.  At all.  The more points you
accumulate the more you stand to lose no matter the quality of the
item?  All people will do is buy the first item they want (minor
upgrade or not) before they start accumulating too many points.

Bidding has flaws but it's perfect compared to this solution.
