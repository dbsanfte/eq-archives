Actually, I'm in the process of getting my Nightmare bow now...have
the silks for the strings, have the cams made, and have the staff.
Just a matter of getting the pieces to the right people for the
combines.  As for the arrows, my normal junk arrows are either 5 or 6
damage, so that's what I'll be using for the experiment I guess.  I
just can't remember whether I'm using bone or ceramic shafts.  I'll be
giving this a shot as soon as I get the Nightmare bow, I guess.
