My monk partners with a higher level shaman most of the time, and I'm
usually the one to call run.  Unfortunatly, days like today where he
doesn't he usually dies (How did he take aggro from me?  I call run,
he jumps up and starts meleeing!?! I regain aggro, tell him to run, he
tells me to FD so his wolf can get aggro.  I FD, giant chuckles at the
wolf and goes for the guy who has poisoned him, slowed him, and
weakened him.  I get back up but can't regain aggro until the shammie
dies.  I FD and wait 30 minutes for him to make the run from Iceclad
to GD).

I felt bad watching him lose over a yellow bulb of xp in 46, but
really, with FD and 1 1/2 bulbs of hp left, and him oom with sow there
is no reason for it.  If the tank calls run, then run.  If you're
fighting with a FD class, then run quick when he calls it, he can run
the mob the other way for a bit, FD and you should be clear.
