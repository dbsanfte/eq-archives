	Ok, R is the reset point, S is the snared target, and A
are the adds... D is the distance you need to wait for the adds
to move to be able to tag. Y is you :-)


  R-----------<-------D------>S-----------------A---Y

	This is the normal way.  The distance between S and A
depends on your snare and how fast the adds move.  Your MA can't
tag S until the adds move past it D distance.  They'll stop and
stand next to you for some amount of time before moving back, and
in some zones may path strangely. You need to wait A+S + S+D mob
move time.


  R-----------------------<-------D------>S--------AY

	This is what I'm suggesting.  A+S + S+D is not only
shorter but happens closer to the group.  The MA can tag
sooner and with more control over the target's pathing.  You
can stand up and help sooner, because for a lot of mobs you don't
need for them to get all the way back to R.  The drawback is that
distance AY is much shorter :-)  If you're good you can snare an 
additional mob _after_ the tag and repeat the FD pull without
running anywhere; a new mob will be standing about at S as the
first dies...  Just wait till the adds move D stand up and snare one.

	Let your pet help on the first target, since it does more
damage than you anyway.  /wink
