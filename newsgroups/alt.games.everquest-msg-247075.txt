Furor has been stumping for Fires of Heaven to quit EQ for WoW since
WoW was first announced. In fact, he's been saying that the whole
guild was going to leave EQ for WoW at least since FoH hit Plane of
Time.

So, yes. Furor has gone to WoW and sold (or is still selling) his
character on PlayerAuctions.com. A lot of people are going with him.
And, since it's not possible to raid on a schedule like FoH's *and*
fully explore a new game, they're not playing EverQuest. But, for the
most part, they're not getting rid of their accounts either. According
to a FoH cleric who is staying, most of the rank-and-file is taking a
wait-and-see attitude.

They may yet stay with World of Warcraft. But, it's hardly a foregone
conclusion. This isn't Furor's first "revolt" against SOE, but it
would be his first successful one.

I don't doubt Jaytee's perspective on the matter. FoH is losing a lot
of member participation right now. But, that doesn't mean they're not
coming back and it doesn't mean FoH is down for the count.
