SoE better jump on this latest patch problem (password screen lockup for XP
users) quick. I'm already considering quitting EQ because of all the
frustration I've been having lately in-game, and this is just adding fuel to
the fire.

Trouble finding groups and people telling me to solo because I'm a Magician
to the point that it ticks me off, mainly. I hate soloing, and if I wanted
to solo I'd just play an offline game instead of paying to play EQ every
month.

My birthday is the 18th of this month, my Magician is about a yellow bubble
away from lvl 39, and I vowed earlier that I'm quitting EQ for good if I
don't make 40, or at least get halfway to it, by then. (I should be at least
lvl 55 by now, but I took almost a 2 month break from the game starting at
Christmas)

I quit EQ once before because of the frustration of never being able to find
anyone to group with and came back 6 months later, using a new character.
The same problem has creeped up (most of the people in my guild that I CAN
group with either prefer to solo or don't play at the same time of day as I
do, and I don't want to quit and join another guild)

I'd like to give some advice, though:

1. Don't assume that because someone plays one of the best soloing classes
in the game that they enjoy soloing. My old main (from when I first started
EQ, and long since deleted) was a Necromancer. My current main is a
Magician, and I have a Druid alt, a BL alt, and a Ranger alt (all excellent
classes for soloing). And I HATE soloing.

2. When someone tells you that they want to join a group and they hate
soloing, either invite them to join you if you're grouping or need a partner
and have room or let it drop. People who keep going on about why I should
solo when I clearly tell them I hate it just plain tick me off, and are
likely to be up Shiznit Creek without a paddle if they ask me for summoned
items for a cr or any other purpose. (I have no problem summoning armor and
weapons for corpse runs or bandages for free, if I have plenty of mana and
it won't take long - But if you're not in a group with me, don't ask me for
summoned food and water, unless you offer some plat. That's my one sticking
point as a Magician)

3. If you're on The Rathe server, and you see a High Elf Magician named
Zyrtryx Conjureblade LFG in Dawnshroud, that's me. Memorize #2 and live by
it if you see me LFG.
