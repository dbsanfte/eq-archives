I don't understand this point of view at all.

EQ is not currently running on its original graphics engine, and there's 
a third (fourth?) replacement engine on the way.

Bug fix?  We've done that many times.

If you want EQ with bug fixes and a new graphics engine, you already 
have your wish, and can keep having your wish as long as they care to 
keep upgrading the game as they have over its life thus far.

IF QE2 is merely going to be a gussied up version of the original game, 
with character transfer, then there's really no point to it, we are 
already playing EQ 6 and soon to be 7.

If, on the other hand, the idea is to replace some of the original 
assumptions of the game, such as character classes (perhaps using just 
three basic classes, further differentiated by choices made after 
creation), quests that involve repeatedly killing the same mob over and 
over, so on and so forth... then its Not something that could have been 
packaged as another EQ expansion, and it doesn't make a lot of sense to 
allow character transfers.

I think it would be clever to in some way create some continuity by 
rewarding players with high level EQ characters with some sort of flash 
they can put on their EQ2 characters that doesn't make them more 
powerful, but thats really more a marketing consideration; how do we 
make people feel that what they did in EQ still matters when they are 
playing EQ2, without making those new to the line feel cheated by not 
having the same opportunities as the old hands.

But its not going to be an EQ expansion, makes no sense for it to be 
that... and in that case, you have to question, why am I going to want 
to move from an enourmous, successful game that I have years of 
experience in, that keeps coming out with new expansions that expand the 
game -and- improve the game, to one which is bound to be smaller in 
scope, full of bugs, and hideous imbalances (just as EQ was when 
released, and to some extent is again with every new expansion)

Game thats had years of fixing and balancing based on hundreds of 
thousands of playtesters (thats what we all are, really, a huge pool of 
playtesters...) and 6 (soon to be 7) major expansions plus quite a few 
minor free expansions... or one thats currently figuring out how to get 
people to pay for the chance to beta test.

EQ 2 has to be different from EQ 1 in order to generate any interest in 
moving, but if its going to be different, why not make it really 
different; to me, trying to cash in on a superficial resemblance to a 
currently successful game line seems... gratuitous and a bit silly.

All that effort being put into game mechanics, how about getting a new 
creative idea while you are at it, instead of recycling Verant's old 
hobbyhorse.  Calling the new game EQ 2 makes me Less likely to try it 
out... and knowing its coming from the same company that put out SWG 
doesn't help a lot either (yes, I know, its different people on the 
project... but still, not confidence inspiring)

But calling it something different wouldn't make me switch either, after 
all, I haven't even tried AC or DAoC.  Three things could make me 
switch: A) really astoundingly good sounding game, ideas, mechanics, 
depth and breadth.  B) Stop all support for EQ1.  No more expansions, no 
more fixes, no more freebies.  Just let it die.   C) decent sounding 
game that other EQ people try and really rave about.

Trouble with A is you'd really have to go a Long ways to get my 
attention, minor tweaks just make me think "great, do that for EQ then, 
and shut up about this "new game".

Trouble with B is you are shooting yourself in the foot, driving away a 
known customer base in the hopes of creating a new one.  But heck, I'm 
as likely to move to a really new game as I am to happen to pick EQ 2 to 
jump to.

C then is the best chance of me moving over; I won't be the first in, 
and I won't be there suffering thru the birth pangs...  but maybe if its 
really really good, I'll give in and take the plunge.

Oddly, it won't make SOE any money, really, if I do.  Because if I move 
and its good, I'll move.  Stop paying the EQ account, pay the EQ2 
account instead.  The money they make off me on the actual game itself 
is nothing compared to the monthly fee... and it seems to me I pay as 
much for an EQ expansion as for most new games; if EQ2 was instead EQ 
expansion 8, then they'd have me for Certain, and collect the same 
monthly fees as ever.

Makes me go Hmmm.

Splendid
