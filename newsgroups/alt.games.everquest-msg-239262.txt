I highly doubt they have 3 teams of server people doing shifts. Far more
likely is one crew doing days, possibly a low paid person on evenings
and nights to monitor things and the day crew are on call and wear
pagers if there is a serious outage. This is pretty standard in the
networking and server business and Sony is not known for paying more
than absolutely necessary to maintain service. I wouldn't doubt they
don't even have off time monitor people but rely on the GM on chat dutie
to page someone with a clue if the servers go down.
