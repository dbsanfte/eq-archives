Verry interesting.  I only saw the reported numbers because I was 
twoboxing and could look at the other screen.  I'm suspecting that it's 
some sort of feature tied to the level III effect to make it do that 
occasionally with spells that would be covered with the level I effect.  
More testing is clearly required. :)  What level was your character?
