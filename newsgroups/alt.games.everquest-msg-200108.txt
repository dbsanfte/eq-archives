I asked in an earlier thread how a caster could survive a summoning mob. The
answer was that there is usually no way for a druid.

Sonic defenders may be an exception. We should be able to fear them because
they are animals (I hope).

For the usual sommoning mob, I wonder if Sunbeam, a blinding spell, would be
usefull?
