Agreed, it needs to be a bit more flexible.

I would very much like this.  Unfortunately, see below.

I wonder how many noticed that, as of this latest patch, you can now
use /channel to set your default chat mode (rather than having to do
the ridiculous F10, right-click routine).  And that it gets saved, so
presumably if you're in gsay mode and switch characters you will
*still* be in gsay mode.  I've been wanting this one for a while.

The problem is that in your eqclient.ini it's using numbers that would
conflict with the chat channels.  "Say mode," for example, is stored
in eqclient.ini as an 8.  Can be fixed, of course, but now they have a
bit more work to do.
