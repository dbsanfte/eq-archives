It was pre-agreed upon that the guilds were at war.

I am not in a guild.  Perhaps I *truly* don't understand the concept of *guild
war*.  I DO know that I can't imagine having to "hate" some other player just
because of the guild he is in....  I suppose the "guild thing" is supposed to
over ride the "we were great friends *before*" thing (I'm talking to players
one on one here)?
