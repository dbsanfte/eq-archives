If FT were your only source of mana regeneration, then yes it would
take 2400 seconds to recover 400 mana.

But most of your mana regeneration will be coming from other sources,
such as clarity/KEI and meditating.  FT is just icing on the cake.

> tick actually mean? Otherwise why would a FT1 item cost so darned much.

FT items cost a lot because FT stacks with all the other more common
means of regaining mana.
