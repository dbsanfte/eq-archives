I never memmed DL much, too slow too much mana. Cast remedy twice and it
does more healing in as much time and it has the longer range. Remedy spells
only became less feasible after I started fighting level 62+ mobs in tier 2
as level 60 but just had to get 61 and supernal remedy to uh, remedy that.

As for the DL chain thats not something I have ever heard of. Would probably
send you OOM really fast especially at 52. If mobs doing too much damage
then reduce time bettween CH, have more people patching MT. IMO CH chain
should work fine if its not then someones not doing thier job correctly
either not timing right or back up healers slacking off.
