Exactly. I could give instant petition responses by simply making
the respose to /petition a dialogue box with the words 'Fuck Off'
in the middle of it, instead of a petition window.

And it wouldnt cost you to pay a lot of outsourced drones who know
nothing about the game to provide the same response to me, either.

I recently emailed SOE about opening up my account again, with some
explicit questions that aren't answered on their web pages.

The response directed me to the server moves page, with no extra 
detail - total form letter.

Brilliant. 

So the accounts remain closed.
