While I agree that -solo- kiting isn't the best cleric exp generator,
I have to say that I've done 52 levels and at least 2/3rds of my
exp has come kiting with a partner.

With a snare class (rangers best) I fear kite, and have done so
since 6th level or so.  I also happily fear kited specters solo
for several levels in my mid thirties... they come pre snared,
and are undead so the mana to kill ratio is a lot better.

With a nuker class, I root kite.  In fact, since I hit 47, fully
half the exp I've gotten has been solo root kiting... but
that required a healthy investment in Tboots to be  practical,
otherwise I spend too much mana on healing myself from
taking a beating while channelling root.

I also had a great deal of fun from time to time doing what
I call the Flashdance: Flash of Light, nuke, flash of light,
nuke.... works much better than fear, since they don't run
all that far or all that long, and don't go anywhere purposefull
that would bring a train back to me.  Unfortunately as I
leveled up, nukes got to taking too long to cast for this
to continue working.

All things being equal, its more effiecient not to have anyone
in the party take damage than it is to heal them.  Sure, a cleric
is better at healing than anyone (except for a fdw limited
level ranges) but that doesn't mean its the best use of time
or energy.

Hmmm, thinking back, I'd say 25% of all my exp thus
far has come from solo kiting in one form or another.  Far
from your "mainstay" requirement, but I bet more than you'd
thought.
