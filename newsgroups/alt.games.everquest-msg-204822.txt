Just double check that Yael isn't up first.  We went in to do some epic 
mobs a few days ago, and Yael was up, fortunately, we did check with a 
nonkos rogue first.  So, we fought down to Yael, killed him after doing 
the epic mobs we needed.

Also on the paradrop, it is possible for anyone to jump in and not die, 
but you have to do it just right, and you have to get lucky.  I am going 
to give it a go with a <10 character a few times to see if I understand 
it correctly now.  Basically, you back off the ledge right at a crack 
with levitate going, stay at the crack, against the wall, look up, and 
keep running at the crack while you plummet.  I know of several people 
who have done it successfully.  I had also heard that you can avoid the 
damage, or some of it by jumping prior to landing, but, I can't vouch for 
that.
