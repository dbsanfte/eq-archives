WoW has an interesting feature: when you are "rested", you earn more XP.
Basically, when you are in an inn or city, either online or camped, you
become rested.  You also become rested when camped in the wilderness, but
at a much lower rate.

When you fight, if you are rested you get an XP bonus: double the XP.  The
more rested you are, the longer this lasts.  A couple hours rest gives a
bonus that only lasts for about one kill.  However, the manual says the
maximum rest, which would take about a week of being in the inn or city
to accumulate, would last for about 1.5 XP bars worth of kills.

So...I think I'll camp out for several days in WoW and play EQ2, then go
back to WoW and play that until I'm no longer rested.  Repeat.
