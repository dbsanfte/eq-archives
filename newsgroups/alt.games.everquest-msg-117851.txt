Nope just this last weekend I was playing at home on my LAN with three=20
other friends on at the same time. We had no problems whatsoever.

Occasionally I do run into a problem where I experience extreme packet=20
loss, and only when I rebooted my machine would it be okay. This can=20
happen at the same time as friends are playing on the same cable modem=20
connection without problems, which means its definately not an ISP=20
issue. However, this hasn't happened for about a week now and not since=20
I reinstalled EQ (had loads of missing textures after upgrading original =

EQ with all the expansion packs).
