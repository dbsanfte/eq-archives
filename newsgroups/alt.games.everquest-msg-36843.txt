Hell I do that all the time with my monk, I want to raise my skills but I actually
don't want to gain experience because I am trying to stay even with some friends
I adventure with.

If its exploiting I should be banned 20 times over by now. I don't think it is. Usually
Verant only gets their panties in a bunch about experience or loot exploits, I have
never heard of anyone being banned for getting their weapon skills up unless they
had the NPC on a pathing glitch or trapped somewhere.
