Not necessarily? That's not the same thing as he said. He just said
"misspellings", not just ones done deliberately, and most people don't
see the word misspellings and think they mean intentional. Either way,
though, if we return to the original context and quotes, the original
problem statement here wasn't the use of emoticons, but how emoticons
would change his original post. He maintained he could have used them
at any time, I informed him that it would have altered the entire feel
of it. He then had a choice - agree with that and say he didn't mean
to sound so pompous, or disagree with that and claim he did. He
instead tried to defend both - maintaining that he meant to sound
pompous but also maintaining that his statement was true, emoticons
could have been used to the same effect. This is incorrect. I think he
knows it was, he just wanted a little scrap more than anything. It's
the only thing that explains his little spaz attack despite me
agreeing with 90% of what he said, pretty much everything beyond the
usefullness of emoticons and their effect on what he wrote. :-)

It's like this. Taras's argument was (originally, he has given up on
this) that emoticons were only necessary if someone didn't have the
tools to express their tone with raw text. I maintained that it is
merely a tool to use when appropriate, not a crutch. Therefore I don't
disagree with anything said about things *other* than emoticons being
used. Spelling alterations? Sure. Changed word here and there? Fine.
All the same deal with emoticons, and equal to it, not superior. This
is very close (but not exact) to what he said, though, isn't it? So
where's the problem? The problem is his attitude that using emoticons
is *inferior*.

I downloaded that sketch just yesterday, you know. But I got the one
from... I think it must be live at the hollywood bowl, instead of the
good flying circus one which I can't find.

Anyways yes, you have a point, and much of the argument was fallout
from him going into a towering rage at his writing skills being
questioned. I found that highly entertaining. I knew he could never
leave off of it, he's had a vendetta against me for over a year. :-)
So I pushed his buttons. I don't disagree with much else of what he
said; I myself might have said exactly the same thing about eight
years ago before I learned better, learned that emoticons were just a
new way, not an inferior way, of expressing things.

Some are really ugly though. Simple is better. Cutesy ones draw the
wrong kind of reaction, in my experience.



>}>>>>The alternative is you really mean to be as pompous as you sound.... 
>
>Yes, he did.

I acknowledged that alternative. It clashes with a later statement
about how he could use emoticons in the original post, however. That's
covered elsewhere.

An example of using text to gain the desired emotions. :-) He *was*
crappin' on mah writin', you know.....

He got two quotes, so I should be allowed one:

"Bored now."
