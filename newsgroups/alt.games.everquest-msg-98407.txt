I'd vote for it.
I must admit, coming from a D&D background I was a bit (disappointed?) when 
I realized that dying wasn't really that important. Sure it's a bit of a 
pain to reclaim the stuff on your corpse, and you lose a bit of XP, but it's   
hardly the end of the world.
Permanent death (save for rezzes at high enough level) would encourage 
grouping together at low levels, something that the threads on the new 
changes have been bemoaning as a lost art.
Also, it gives those of us who are new to the game, when we eventually get 
to the hallowed levels, to say 'yeah, you did it when it was easy and you 
didn't fear dying'  ;-P


I have flame resistance of 160
