Con only gives you a "ballpark" figure on what the mob's level is. A
blue con could be one level below you, it could be as many as 15 at
high levels. The one that's 1 level below won't give as much xp as the
one that's 5, 10, or even 15 below.

You are right, though, equipment has no effect on xp beyond how fast
you can kill...
