>> One more tip is to have your partner keep hailing him while you are
handing him the items, so he doesn't run off if takes you too long to get
the 3250 ready. <<

I would suggest that when you get ready to go get your boots, take *exactly*
3250 gold with you. That way all you have to do is shift click, and you got
the lump sum ready for him.
