I've been soloing my 62 enchanter with Dire Charm for a while now.
My general MO is to charm a mob and give it some weapons and kill
some other mobs for a while, and then when my pet gets down to
about 40% find a safe spot and sit for a few minutes to let my
pet regen to full.

The other day I decided to go someplace new, so I headed off to
Sebilis.  I'd heard good things about it, and I was excited at the
chance got some phat lewts.  Right there at zonein was a convenient
Froglok Dar Knight, who became my new best friend.  We killed a
few other froggies including some nasty wizards who made quite a
dent in my pet's health bar so we went back to zonein and sat down,
and I went off to the kitchen to make a snack.

When I came back a few minutes later, I was surprised to see that
my pet's health had not recovered nearly as much as I expected.
In other places such as Nadox, Kael Drakkal, Acrylia Caverns and
Veksar, my pets will regen at a respectable rate, but Mr. Froglok
Dar Knight was having none of it.  I tried /pet sit down, but that
didn't seem to help much.

What was the problem?  Do some mobs just have a slower regen rate?
(I checked, and he didn't have any DoTs.)
