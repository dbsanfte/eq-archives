Based on what I have heard, a character without a charm slot item  to
combine with the adenture stone can still participte in an adventure,
get a few points, and buy and charm then do the combine. But, assuming
that a better charm slot item become available, how does on move the
adventure stone (aug), but retain,  the adventure stone, since using
solvent to remove an aug renders that aug useless?

Could be, that you simply destroy the old charm which includes the
stone. And go through the initial process of obtaining a new adventure
stone to combine with the new charm.? hm.
