Its about time they put in something higher than lvl 5 in tox forest. In the
bad old days, erudite necros had to grind it through to level 8 in tox
forest just to get gather shadows to get them out past qeynos. No nexus
scions in those days. Once you got to level 8 you could camp the skel hut
near the river or the skels near paineel for good xp anyway, provided you
had an alt to break the spawn.
