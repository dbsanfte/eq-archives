I know EXACTLY how you feel (about FV)!

Actually if you are talking about duoing...A Shaman would be a better
choice. Hasting Lenny and slowing mobs is a lot more efficient in the
long run. Not to mention the stat buffs, SoW, Shrink for Dungeons
(since Lenny is an Ogre), DoTs, and the extra tanking ability of the
Shaman pet at higher levels (think of it as a manaless DoT).

You should really play the class that YOU want to play and will enjoy
the most. Playing a class based on what you think the server (or your
guild) needs might lead to frustration in the future if you are not
100% happy with the choice.

Are they short on Beastlords? :-)

Yes (for a short answer) In the long run a cleric can do more for a
group by sitting and medding than anything else in a raid or dungeon
crawl.

>can I be anything more than a healer and pre-fight buffer?

Yes, you will be a rezz'er :-P 

Seriously though.....Look at your spell line-up (eq.castersrealm.com)
as the class progresses through levels. You will find that clerics get
some great spells for fighting undead, and stuns can be used to great
effect. If you choose your hunting grounds based on your spell
line-up, you will be able to do more than sit heal and pre-fight buff.
