On my server (AB) all camps in Velks and Seb are practically perma-camped
and loads of players seek their fortune in the normally less camped zones.

Try Chardok, Maiden's Eye, Fungus Grove, Akheva Ruins, The Grey, Burning
Woods, Skyfire (good place with all the clerics camping Ragefire these days)
or try some old-world stuff like LGuk (camping king is still decent exp at
55) or SolB's BnB (usually you can find another player or two to help here).

If all else fails, play an alt.
