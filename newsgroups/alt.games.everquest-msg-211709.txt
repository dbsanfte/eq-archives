    I've heard of the Sebilite Protector being soloed by a 65 necromancer
(albeit in great gear). If one level 65 can solo something, odds are two
level 65's including a cleric can take it down as well. Can they hit level
65? Yup, occasional players can get XP (mage already has 21 AA's at 61).
Could they clear down to Prot? Make friends with a crowd control class and
it wouldn't be hard. The only thing really stopping them is time. It'll take
them time to level up, and maybe they want to do these things now. If that's
the case, I might have to move them to the "time-starved power gamer"
category!

    If the reward was good like you're implying, it would make obsolete vast
sections of the game. Instead of giving our occasional player friends more
choices, it would limit them - go to LDoN or fall behind your peers.
