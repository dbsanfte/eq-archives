	Well, if they make the new recipes 

	A) possible.  Throw in some stuff that trivials at 100 as well
as 300, and dont make every new recipe require a rare drop from a raid mob.

	B) interesting.  The results dont have to be uber but they should
be cool.  A large single stat boost for instance (+15 wis) or even a neat
but useless effect like fireworks.  The idea is that I want some reason
to make something other than "get skillup".

	I give most of my tradeskilled stuff away.  Or just drop it.  Really,
2 gold for an acrylia studded mask?  Grats rot.
