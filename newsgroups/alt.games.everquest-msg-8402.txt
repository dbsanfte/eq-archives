Quite high, especially if you're not KOS to live frogs.  I did that on
level 11, no death.

Zone into Lguk at the north west point, go through the minotaur
labyrinth, and you emerge on "dead side" very close to the assassin
room.

People hunting in the asssassin room will most of the time /ooc that
there is a mask there.
