Well, not exactly, but, given the differences in needed xp to level, 
close enough.

Seems like a likely explanation, although, to be honest, the only xp that 
is decent in 65 LDoN is AAXP, I would not care to see how little my xp 
bar moves if it were all going into levelling xp.

I had always heard that at the high levels, the xp is not all that great.  
You can get far better xp hitting planes instead.  You do LDoN for 
reasons other than the amount of xp it gives you.
