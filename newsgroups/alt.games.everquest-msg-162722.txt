	Yeah, and being in the desert makes you use water faster too!  (Free clue:
no, it doesn't.  In either case.

	I propose the alternate theory that you lose track of time and miss
force-feedings.

	Rangers have a very hard time getting improved melee weapons in the
endgame.  Itemization is very poor; there are very few Ranger-only weapons and
too many of the shared ones are defaulted to other classes.  Haste is another
issue -- since Rangers get haste in their off-hand with their epic, they're
last if ever to get another 40% haste item.  Meaning they don't get to improve
their off-hand weapon, either, or use the 2H weapons the design team keeps
flagging as Ranger usable or even Ranger only, for some unbelievable reason.
(If I did get to HoH and got a Windblade or Ornate Warder's Broadsword, I'd
have to bank it or sell it.)

	Bows are a different story.  Most endgame Rangers can't get their hands on
Acrylia Handled Broadswords and Claws of Vyzh'dra, but anyone in a
medium-sized guild can whack Doomshade and get a Primal-ratio bow.  Such a bow
won't outdamage the aforementioned melee weapons (except with Trueshot), but
it will knock the socks off your epics.  Now bows of similar or superior
quality are showing up in PoP in places where smaller guilds can get at them.
Thus, Rangers emphasize Archery in the endgame -- because it is the only way
most of them can improve their DPS past Kunark levels.  Of course, they have
to spend 45 AA to do it.
