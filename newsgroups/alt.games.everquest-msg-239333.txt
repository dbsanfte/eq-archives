I'm making the mino brew in halas as you suggested, and it is the fire cider
bar. I can reach one of the vendors and the brewery without moving and the
others are a few steps at most.

 I've decided that brewing and baking are astonishingly easy, and that
tailoring and smithing past 200 seem too hard unless you are rich perhaps.
The flawless rockhopper hides were selling for 700 pp each in the bazaar,
and selling out fast too. I don't know of a way to get tailoring past 203
using vendor bought ingredients.

I priced combine temper on my mule at 550 each, thinking no-one would ever
buy them, and they went right away.

So if you want to max out a skill easy, and you don't think you'll ever get
aa's (like me), go for brewing!
