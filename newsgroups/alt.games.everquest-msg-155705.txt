Yup, did it recently. We had 15 players, range app. 46-60. Let me put it
this way : we got wiped!

Here's what happens :

After you kill Barducks, you have app. 5 mins. before gnolls will attack the
city.

3 waves with a few minutes between each wave.

Basically, you need AT LEAST 3 strong groups. And I'm talking 55+ if you go
in with only 3 groups. What we did, and what would have worked, if we had
been higher-level players, was to place a group inside each building in the
town. To protect the NPC's inside. Gnolls seem to spawn right outside the
buildings, so I recommend no exploring during invasion.

Preferably, if you have extra men to spare, place them close to the NPC's
outside the buildings, to protect them.
AND, finally, if you have any spare surplus quad-kiters, have them pull 4
gnolls away now and then, and quad away. Should take the pressure a bit off
the groups inside houses.

MY personal experience was that the building right behind zone-in spot (from
SG) was the LEAST crowded. Not a lot of Gnolls there.
The 2 other buildings were practically swarming with them. This could be a
coincidence, so I can't say for sure.

The main NPC to keep alive is Sergeant Caelin. BUT, keep as many townsfolk
as possible alive. The more alive at end, the better rewards you will
receive.

Now, about the rewards : the invading gnolls drop some NO RENT,
class-specific items. Give these to Sergeant Caelin, and recieve NO DROP,
class-specific items in return. Again, the more townsfolk alive, the better
reward.
Unfortunately, we were so busy rezzing everyone that by the time we were
just about ready to see what (crap) items he might have for us, he had
despawned! I reckon you have about 15 minutes after invasion to turn in
before it's too late.
But as far as I can tell, unless you keep pretty much ALL townsfolk alive,
expect no more than token rewards, with some 1-charge clickable effect...
again, can't say for sure, but so I heard.

If you need any more info, or if you think I left some unanswered questions,
feel free to mail me.
