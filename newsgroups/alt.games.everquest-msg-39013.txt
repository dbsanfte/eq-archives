I feel your right. I think Verant knows it is up against the wall with
Luclin in terms of retaining long term players. The end game of EQ is
hideously twisted, and people at the high end will probably leave
anyway to see the next big thing (DAoC). So they are going to try and
make lowbie only content. Unfortunately they are doing it ass
backwards and the first time a lowbie misses part of a quest and
outlevels it and has to choose between deleveling, getting a lowbie to
farm it, or aborting the quest they are going to get a taste of the
Vision(TM), and I really doubt they will like it. 

I think WoW will be the drop in game that revitalizes the next big
wave of MMORPG's. Just because I think Blizzard will make it fast,
make it fun and make it capable of pleasing casual as opposed to hard
core gamers.
