As someone else pointed out already I believe, there isn't a way to loop,
barring an outside program that breaks the EULA.  In some cases it would be
possible to just hold the key down, and have it repeat that way, not sure if
that would work with bind wounds in particular off hand, as I don't know if
you can skillup on it if you are not actually healing yourself with it.
