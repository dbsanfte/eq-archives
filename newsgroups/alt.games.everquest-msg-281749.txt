  The overarching themes here are access and self-reliance. We are trying
to open up as many zones as possible, as many upgrade-dropping mobs
as possible, and be able to do them ourselves. Right now we need allies
to do Time; we would certainly need them for the elemental gods. That
would be multiple raids over multiple days, versus just one more Time
run through Phase 3 to get us fully Time accessed. And our business in
the elemental planes isn't with the gods; it's with the lesser named. We
can farm Air, Earth A, and Water, and are working on Fire.

  We can't make too many demands of our recruits rgarding flags. We
are a small guild raiding at the worst time, 9 AM Eastern. Very few
people play those hours.
