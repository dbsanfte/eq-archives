   Yesterday on Drinal, the MotD warned that attacking
Soulbinders forbidden, and violators could be banned,
or words to that effect.  And for the first time since
I was playing in Freeport, the SB there wasn't getting
spanked every time I passed him.
   I think there's a chance the exploit will be fixed
with Wednesday's patch, but I wouldn't count on it.

Annie <--- Feels like buy the SB a round of ale.
