At work, I use a weird mouse from a Norwegian company, it's called the Anir
Mouse.  It's basically a normal mouse with a joystick type handle on top of
it with the buttons on the handle.  I have found it to be mediocre as far as
pointing ability, even after using it for quite some time, but excellent at
preventing me from suffering from any problems due to mousing.
