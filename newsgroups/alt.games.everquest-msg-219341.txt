Fair enough. But I figure a drop based tradeskill encourages at least as 
much player interaction moving components around as tradeskills 
themselves which was one of the reasons suggested for keeping 
tradeskillers few... to prevent people from learning them themselves and 
ceasing to interact.

Actually trading components probably amounts to more interaction: the 
components are at least desireable, while the products themselves for 
the most part are not.

That SoE has watered it down to unattended player vendors notwithstanding.
