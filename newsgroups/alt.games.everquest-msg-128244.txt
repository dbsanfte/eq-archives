You can still use the "Market" channel on your server, and places like
EC and GFey will still be used for selling. I agree that not have
EQ:SOL will be a pain, but there will still be players "Day Trading"
in the old world. The new Bazaar Interface is like a mall or shopping
center. You go in and pay a set price for the items you want. There is
still plenty of room for a "Swap Meet" market, where players can
gather and barter for goods.

You have got to be joking. Porting around Norrath (and the moon) is
trivial. Only the East side of Antonica is a problem, because you have
to run/port to NK to get to the closest Nexus Spire.

It's no different than it is now. You still have to get to your
servers "Market Zone" if you want to buy/sell. The only change is in
moving that zone to the Bazaar and giving players the ability to
become merchants and go AFK.

BS! It is only non-accessable to people who do not own EQ:SoL.
