Yes, nothing can drop a mob faster than a wizard. However, once
you are out of mana you are weak as a kitten.

If you get Jboots or use SoW potions you can solo at the higher
levels. However, you will be sitting on your ass 90% of the
time getting your mana back.

EQ is a grouping game, every class CAN solo but some are
easier than others. If you want a class to solo then pick
druid, necro, or mage, they have the easiest time soloing.
