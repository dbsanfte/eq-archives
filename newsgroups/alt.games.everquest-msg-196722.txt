heh, seems that I'm not the only one who had to reformat recently.  Dang 
computer forced me to do a reformat, I restarted computer and it said 
non system disk, oh boy was I upset.  8 hours later, literally, I 
finally got my internet back up and EQ back loaded, thank Tunare I keep 
all my disks.
I just installed all the disks and went straight into EQ with no 
problems.  I started with the PoP disks because I was sure it had 
classic on it and that was the only disk I couldnt find in the pile.  I 
think Kunark has Classic on it too, so you can skip the classic disk too 
  if you use that one first, I guess.
