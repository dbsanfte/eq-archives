I can't log into the account for the same reason I can't just walk
into a motel room you're renting. You're paying for exclusive access
to it, but that doesn't mean you own it. As for selling abandoned
accounts, they could if they really felt like it, but they opt not to
to grant a customer the opportunity to return to it.

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.
-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 
(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
