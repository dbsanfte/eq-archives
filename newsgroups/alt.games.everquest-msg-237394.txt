a wee bit of a difference between game and reallife, bud.

ultimate if you find an opportunity to make money PLAYING A GAME. go for it.
thats peoples dream, to make money doing what they 'would rather' be doing
(ie, instead of working I would rather being playing eq. or playing golf..
or throwing the football around with my nephew.. or watching the game on
tv.. or slamming the ham...whatever)

at any rate. this arguement isnt going to change any opinions for anyone.
people who were selling before will continue to sell, people who were buying
will continue to buy. prices will continue to be fucked and people will have
to work twice as hard, just as they've always done and didnt even know till
they read some rant on some forum somewhere.

And the clever will find ways to make additional plat (without exploits)
before everyone does. thats the way its always been.
