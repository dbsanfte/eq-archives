    Let me help you out by being supportive, then. If you want to apply to a
raiding guild, as you indicate later, you'll need the AA's now. End of
debate.

    Snip on the ones that are pointless, or have little point.

    I dispute this. But you'll see why later.

    Mastery > all. You will notice the mana savings, and it gives decreased
chance of a fizzle. When Rombus told you on Graffe's that the wizards he
knew that got it did XP faster than the Fury folk, that should have told you
all you needed to know. If you need additional convincing, think of it like
this: how often will Fury make a difference quadding, and how often will
Mastery make a difference quadding? Fury doesn't really help, since you want
all four mobs dead at the same time anyways and the odds of critting on that
one resistant fellow in your quad are pretty damn small. Mastery saves mana
on every spell you cast (despite the description, it does work on every
cast).

    I've again snipped the ones I think you should ignore, for now.

    I agree with your order, except I've snipped quick evac. If you get that
before you get level 61 you're mad, and there's PoP stuff you'd want before
Quick Evac (like that Harvest of Druzzil thing). So my order would be:

SCM 1-3, SCF 1-3, SCFM 1-3, MC 1-3, Exodus, Manaburn.

    If you're really keen on Exodus, move it ahead of MC 2 and 3, but not MC
1. MC 1 is quite cheap for what it does. If it were my wizard I'd start
thinking about hitting 61 right after MC 1, but I don't know your
circumstances.
