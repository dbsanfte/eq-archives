I've done stacks for free. 4000 mana is not a big deal for someone with
180 int and Clarity.

Your a druid, you travel well. I'm a chanter, one the things we do best is
regain mana. What you think I'm -not- going to have clarity on me for this
little casting session? Are you mad?

Because the only place I knew for sure I could get them was LoIO. There
are other places as many have pointed out to me, still doesn't stop
chanters from all over swinging by the windmill to get their vials. We're
chanters, not druids. Travelling blows ;-)

On the contrary, the first time I wanted to go to brownie village it was
easy to get a druid to come with me from BB. I can get any caster to do
just about anything I ask of them, because I make sure to pay well, and
not with cash. He spent less than 20 minutes running with me to the
brownies (we were both wolves after all.. was my first time in wolf form,
very fun ;-), then I spent the next hour or so swinging by the BB docks
ever 20 mins or so and hitting him with a breeze. (He was quad kiting the
dwarves at the dock) Ended up getting a guild invite from him when the
evening was over.

Not to sound condesending but... duh.

Chanter? Mana regen? I have 180 int when fully buffed out and clarity
sitting on me. I have just a few points shy of 1200 mana when full.  OK
fine, 15 minutes is slightly on the low side, (especially at pre clarity
levels) but it takes me -maybe- 6 minutes to med from zero to full. At my
current level I can do just barely shy of 6 vials on a full bar of mana.
(after the 5th I sit for about 10 seconds and can stand and do the 6th)

You do the math.

I'll accept money for the job, but if I'm not doing anything and am not
pressed for time, I usually do it for free.
