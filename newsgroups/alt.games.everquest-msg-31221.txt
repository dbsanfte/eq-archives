I am still a bit lacking in the enchanter class knowledge. I only remember
grouping with one possibly twice. Tunare has a lack of them (or so it
appears I extremely rarely group with them ad level 32...) when I do I
sometimes get a little over excited and attack things they mez. I have to
calm down and listen to em explain what they mez in what situation. I think
the lack of people willing to listen is what may of resulted in enchanters
being a rare class to me...
