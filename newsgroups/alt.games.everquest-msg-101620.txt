My enchanter is 16 and is starting to get requests for breeze.  I haven't had
any ask me for crack personally, but I have seen it shouted frequently, "paying
for CRACK atthe DOX", etc.

If someone does come up to me and say, "CRACK PLZ", I think my response
will be, "Err  what language is that?  Ogre?!  Whatever it is, I don't speak it."

I hate the word "PLZ" too.   Usually I just won't respond to anyone that uses it... especially
beggars... those are the worst.   "got any stuff for a lvl 1 warrior plz?"  bleh!

My friend's druid's reponse to "Sow plz" is, "plz inzrt coin".  I could use that too :P
Maybe I will be more specific, "plz inzrt 5pp".   If someone asks politely, I breeze
for free.  Rude and lazy costs.
