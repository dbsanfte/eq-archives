Agree completely here. What better time to ambush the enemy? No one is in
proper fighting gear, only stuff that looks good, no one is paying any
attention and hopefully (for the attacking party) most of them are well and
truly plastered. Wayhey, is what I say. Thumb your nose and the enemy and
merrily lob their heads of with lots of hey-nonny-nonny and blood all over
the place.

Mind you, it's not very polite, though devilishly cunning. No point in
inviting the enemy over for tea and crumpet. I say, the 'offending' guild in
this case made use of some very basic tactics. The element of suprise works
like a charm every time.

So, boffo to the victors. And the losers should have known better.
