I don't have my epic yet, and in the groups i've been in over the last few
levels, i've been essentially the healer. I've got protection of the
cabbage, is that better for a caster than virtue? I noticed a lot of casters
get virtue as a preference, but i would have thought the mana regen would
have been more attractive. Anyway, I was in a full group in grieg's end with
2 clerics, a mage, a warrior and a necro and wasn't quite sure what i should
be doing, other than evac duty. I str buffed and regrowthed the tanks and
pets as approriate, but my highest fire based dot (the one with ac debuff,
92 damage a tick) kept fizzling, despite winged death working every time.

Winged death was lasting most of each fight, so i felt it was appropriate to
cast it, but was the ro spell worth the mana? I was almost always lom or
even oom, while the other casters seemed to be doing pretty well. I was in
howler form, used my clicky legs to root adds (not that root lasted more
than a few seconds), had kei, and spent as much of the time possible medding
but it was still a struggle. I don't have raid gear and haven't done ldons
with that char yet. Should i forget about levelling and go all out on
getting everything for my epic up to the point i can't solo? The druid epic
dot seemed the only thing i was lacking but i felt my group felt i wasn't
providing as much as the others were; it's hard to compete with the cleric's
Cheal or a mages DS.

I got a full yellow of xp after playing last night, so i can see getting to
60 or getting pre-raid ready for my epic, but if i can't organise raiders to
help me out, i'll still be 59 (assuming no unrezzed deaths) whereas i could
be lv 60. What adds more to a group?
