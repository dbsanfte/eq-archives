its not my character... Geeze

my  char is a 40 enchanter... i also  have a mid lvl warrior and was
admiring the gear. thought it might been a scam because that seems rather
inexpensive form the prices i see on account and with gear like that

Yall are so quick to flame anyone whom isnt a regular 30post's a day poster
