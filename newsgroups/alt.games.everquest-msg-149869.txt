OP seemed mostly interested in faction.  So, if he's not going to Kael,
best bet would be to not worry about xp much at all, get a small group
of lo 40s (one tank and some damage dealers) and kill Giants and Wolves
as fast as he can.  CoV faction hits won't be worth much, but it
shouldn't take too long to get Coldain faction up.
