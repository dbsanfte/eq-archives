Well, I finally found Vin.

It happened 30 seconds after a group came down and started killing the
beggars. Now I know it may be a coincidence, but it sure seems like Vin
Moltor is on the same spawn cycle as the other beggars. Sigh. So it seems
that you have to kill folks on the same faction as the quest NPC to get him
to spawn. This seems especially odd when Verant went out of their way to
give you two options: "bad" - Kill Vin, and "good" - bake pie, to get the
Paw container. Be good, bake the pie. Then go down the sewers and slaughter
every unamed beggar you can find, nice thinking ....
