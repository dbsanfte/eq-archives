Hey Monual,
	I have enjoyed the stories you have posted and would like
permission to gather them in one HTML document so I can share it with
my fellow Guild members and friends.
	I hate to say this, but I feel my guild and myself will never
reach the High End encounters that you have.  
	Your stories make me dream of the possibility, and I would
like to have my Guldies, and friends see those dreams as well.

I appreciate all of them... Please, PLEASE keep em coming.
