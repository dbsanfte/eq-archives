This got me thinking about what the 'best thing' to do about KSing would 
be.

First aggro is a decent rule, but favors twitch players and melee 
(assuming that spells have casting times...)

Most damage is also a decent rule to consider, except it's the rule that 
basically created KSing.

The main thing seems to be defining 'ownership' of a mob.  EQ would be 
soooo much better in this respect if a mob changed appearance in some 
noticeable way (apparenlty WoW mobs 'grey out'?) when someone aggroed it.

Aggroing a mob really should define 'ownership'.  But a couple other 
things maybe should, as well.  Like camping, for example.  What if a mob 
that was about to spawn knew who killed it (or its PH) last, and for the 
first 6 seconds or so that it was up, it was only visible or trackable to 
people in the group/raid who killed it last?  I suspect that would 
work quite well for mobs with a reasonable spawn time, say, under an hour.  
Might want the 'early warning' time to be a bit longer for wandering mobs, 
like the south ro AC.  That might end up giving away a bit of information 
about what the wandering mob's PHs actually are, though. :) (Picture two 
rangers, one killing undead exclusively, one killing spiders exclusively, 
and comparing who can track him first.)

Of course, that might be a really bad thing for mobs like AoW or 
Severilous.  Raid mobs produce an entirely different set of KS issues, 
like leapfrogging.  What if there was a 'mob reservation' system?  Tracker 
spots a mob up, and creates a 'reservation list' for the mob with a 
password.  As his teammates and cronies arrive, they can join the 
reservation list, provided they're actually in the zone or the right part 
of the zone, and in the raid with the other folks on the list.  When 
there are enough folks on the reservation list (say, 75% of the lowest 
number of folks who've ever killed the mob) the mob becomes greyed out for 
their particular raid, and other reservation lists are turned off until 
such time as the raid with the reservation wipes, or the mob is killed and 
respawned, or a time limit appropriate for the encounter is exceeded, or 
too many people on the reservation list leave the zone.  Then there'd be a 
sort of quantitative measure of 'first in force'.  Of course that'd be 
kind of throwing out the whole 'racing to a mob' excitement.  Baby? 
Bathwater?  What'cha think?
