Some of my fondest memories were from my first days in EQ back in 2001. 
The first character I created was a high elf wizard, and I can still 
remember getting the crap startled out of me just outside Felwithe by 
that orc pawn's growl as it ambushed me on the trail. I remember the 
epic battles on Orc Hill near Kelethin and subsequent missions (and 
corpse runs) "deep" into Crushbone.

I remember crafting banded armor and selling it for 1pp/point of AC or 
90pp for a full set, and barely being able to keep up with the requests. 
I also remember later whipping up a complete set as a gift for a brand 
new player I met in Freeport. They were thrilled (for the record, they 
were male :P).

I actually enjoyed the time I spent haggling in NFP behind the Jade 
Tiger, building my meager funds up to the point when I could finally 
afford that Centi Longsword or Golden Efreeti Boots for alts. I'm not a 
big fan of the vending machine arrangement of the Bazaar, regardless of 
its obvoius benefits.

I had a blast grouping in Oasis on Orc Highway. Dealing with the 
frequent adds helped to hone my skills. I could have done without the 
Spectre trains though. :P

Venturing into Kithicor Forest still makes me a bit nervous. I can 
remember running through it in my teens, hugging the wall as high as I 
could. I was unable to see another player approaching at a run going the 
other direction until they popped up almost right in front of me, 
causing me to nearly wet myself.

Solo'ing in LoIO was fun, always being wary of adds. Grouping at the 
giant fort in FM was nice as well, hoping for that rare drop or two 
(forest loop, was it?)

I think it says something that my fondest memories are from the SoL 
days. Oh yeah, I liked the boats - not necessarily the time they 
required in waiting and travel combined (although there was always Gems 
:P), but the fact that they expanded the world. Travelling was really 
travelling and not just teleporting. I feel that was important.

As far as your second question goes, I'd say I did a bit of both. My 
primary interests were in experiencing content, but there were certainly 
a few times when I would go into xp grinding mode to achieve some 
milestone such as maybe the last couple of levels to get to level 14 for 
SoW as a druid or 16 for breeze as an enchanter.
