If you are careful, Emerald Jungle will see you through many levels from
this point on. You can solo kite there, or hook up with a group by the
Trak's line. If you stick your head into CoM every once in a while, you
might get lucky and get in a group there for insanely good xp, though I
wouldn't reccomend it solo. Easy to get swarmed there.
