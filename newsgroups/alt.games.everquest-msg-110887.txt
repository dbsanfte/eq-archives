There weren't many red names even when everyone started with the book.  If
you want to make one, you should be able to talk to the POD and get him to
give you a book.

That was also how high level people who occasionally turned red as a joke
did it.

BTW, I seem to recall hearing that at one point, if two people were dueling
on a blue server, any red player was able to attack them.  I don't know if
that is true, and if it was, I don't know if it still works.  If it
did/does, you can see where some of the joke possibilities of turning in the
book at high level arise. :-)

Below level 10 (or is up to level 10?), corpses behave as you are now
seeing: player respawns at bind point with all their equipment.  After that,
they behave the old way (respawn naked, equipment on corpse).

The reason low level corpse stay around at all is to allow for the
possibility of a res.  There are new lower level res spells, so getting a
res at level 9 isn't all that unreasonable.  If you aren't gonna get a res,
there is no point in looting the corpse, other than pride.
