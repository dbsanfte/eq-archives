I have a MultiBind macro that is as follows:

/pause 110, /doability 10
/pause 110, /doability 10
/pause 110, /doability 10
/pause 110, /doability 10
/doability 10

I get Bind Wound executed 5 times every time. Maybe it has something to do 
with the ability you're executing. Is nine seconds enough of a delay? I'm 
pretty sure fishing requires a longer delay than that.
