Its a last ditch improvement effort. People generally tell you to do
it when either they or you have no idea how to fix the problem the
right way. If you just take a little bit of time to make sure that
your system is running right and don't add any bloated bad products,
get any virii or trojans or anything, there is really never any need
to reformat and just defragging sometimes should be enough.

You can reformat and reinstall everything every other day but it
really would seem a lot more easier to me to just figure out how to
make your computer run right instead.
