Well, since by definition you can't KEI someone else without getting it
yourself, then you'd have to click it off, yes.  The mana cost is a
consideration, however.
Take a typical level 62 chanter who's not in an uberguild - such as myself.
I roughly calculate my mana pool to be around 3400.  3400/800 = 4 casts of
KEI before I'm oom.  I've got FT1 from a solstice earring, plus sitting mana
regen, plus KEI; it takes about 40 seconds to regen the mana for another
KEI.  So theoretically, a KEI costs me 40 seconds of time, whether I do one
person or a group.  (This is why KEI vendors ask you to group with them.)  I
could toss in casting time as well, and make it a full minute, give or take.
Mana isn't free, as so many advocate - it costs me play time.

Again, irrelevant now, since I don't sell KEI any more.  Irrelevant to me,
anyway.
