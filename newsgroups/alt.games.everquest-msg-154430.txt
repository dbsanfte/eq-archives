Any bard instrument that is usable from the primary slot
is one handed and does not interfere with the secondary
slot.

One example would be the Flawless Ivory Horn found
on level 5 or so mobs in Shadeweaver's Thicket.  This
one is great, its both primary and secondary weildable,
and since most wind songs are either "work" or "don't
work" you won't much miss the bonuses, as you might
with a good drum or brass instrument

Another would be the Lute of the Jahrin Apprentice,
level 7 or so quest reward for Vah Shir bards who
didnt twink themselves past a really nice toy.

Then there's the Lute of the Howler, ALMOST
as cool as the Jahrin Apprentice one (looses
points by screaming twink in the hands of
anyone under 40)

I'd give three inches off the tip of my tail if I could
find a decent primary slot drum... one inch for
a primary brass.

Llyric, proudly Vah Shir 40 bard, Morell Thule
