I do, and despite some of the aggravations - I enjoyed the
heck out of it.  I really liked it in the days when not everything
was done already.

I just don't see how EQ could continue to be expanded - the
code must have been fairly complex in the first place, and the
number of modifications made in the last 3 years must have made
it in to an ungodly convoluted mess.  At some point you're faced
with the option of completely rewriting it, or not being able to
make any more modifications without breaking too many things. 
Also, most of the basic gameplay is set in stone, and changing
it is well nigh impossible in the current game (reducing downtime,
excessive twinking, a broken economy - just to name a few).  At
some point you need to take what you've learned and start from
scratch.
