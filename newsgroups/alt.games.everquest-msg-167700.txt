}Haven't tried this, but I would think atone would be useful in raid

}the mob on the main tank.

There is a significant risk here to atoning or blurring late in the 
fight:  it clears the hate list completely.  If your atone/blur lands 
right before some caster's nuke, that mob's gonna leave the MT and head 
straight over toward the casters...

So ya might wanna warn people that that's the plan and when you're going 
to do it so they can stop nuking or otherwise building aggro for a sec 
and let the tank get back up the list.
