  Malevolence is, or rather was, the weapon of Innoruuk himself.  It
was cursed by Mithaniel Marr so that, according to legend, everytime a
being is defeated with the weapon, Innoruuk himself is weakened.
Lanys T'Vyl sought Malevolence after Bloody Kithicor so she could
weaken her father enough to eventually take his place.  Your friend
must have been involved in assist Lanys somehow to get the title and
the weapon... I didn't know the weapon would actually ever be
dispensed to anyone, even as an artifact.  It's pretty impressive
though.
