Definately. Did ya miss the smiley? I notice you didn't bother answering 
though! :p

> Wait....do I now officially have a stalker?!

Don't flatter yourself. You don't even unofficially have a stalker. I 
responded to one post that was irresistably similiar to the other thread 
in nearly every salient detail:

1) you argued previously that they had pre-auth to charge your cc for 
"anything you owe them"

2) The full fare server transfer pricing has been made public for years

3) The 1-month free move was similiarly publically available knowledge

4) A presumption of an error is made. (That they left the service on in 
'free mode' longer than intended with no malice or intent to defraud 
anyone, but temporarily without the automatic safegaurds to ensure that 
the server transfer had been pre-paid before accepting it. That 
oversight on their part however, doesn't affect the terms that you 
previously agreed to.

5) The fact that you typed /move... after the month was up is implicit 
acceptance of the full fare service and pricing.

If they come back at you for it its "dishonest" and "unethical" not to 
pay. To try and avoid payment is equivalent to theft because you were 
"trying" to take advantage of their oversight...when you knew what the 
terms were up front.

Sound familiar? ... or Not.

I think we both don't care much anymore. This last post touched my funny 
bone though, and was irresistible. Forgive me.

I wouldn't hold your breath. :p
