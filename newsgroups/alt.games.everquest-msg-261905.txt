Did these boards go away? Move? I haven't been to steel warrior in a while,
but it seemed to be *the* warrior board. Now it's totally and completely
vanished. And I'm sure I was just over at monkly business a week or two
ago. Now I'm getting a 403 Not Authorized error??

Just curious where the up-and-coming warriors and monks are supposed to
get all their info now...
