What worked for one of my Warriors was at L20 or so I made up
about 1000 arrows and headed out to EK with a Ranger.  The two
of us spent a pleasant afternoon bowkiting Crags together,
collecting many silks and Archery skill-ups (about 30 skill-ups
each and, iirc, each of us dinged level as well).  The Ranger's
husband had a 14 Druid who hung around hunting cats and keeping
us SoW'd.
