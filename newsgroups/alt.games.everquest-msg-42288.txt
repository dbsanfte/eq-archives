I don't think any of what you are saying is the problem here. The Muslims
know that they can not tolerate "Western values" in their religion but
there is a large space between their countries and the West (I know about
the Muslims in southern Europe and the proximity of Turkey to Europe but
the Muslims have much room to live). The problem is Israel, there is no
getting away from that. Israel is like a malignancy in the Middle East, it
does not rest, it constantly tries to metastasize ("Jewish settlements").
If the "West" was the problem and not Israel then why don't the Muslims
bomb Britain, France and Germany? 

Only the French have been bombed by Muslims and that was because of Algeria
and the bombings were by Algerians. That is the "Vietnam" for the French.
The only Muslim bombing in Germany was by Libyans against U.S. military
personnel in Germany.

Israel is the problem.
