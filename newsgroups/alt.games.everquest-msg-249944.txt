Its definately an interesting idea. You would have a lot more issues
to deal with stemming from identity theft though. Its one thing to
have a max 6-month or 1-year fee deducted on a card, especially when
the money is tied to that account.. its another thing to max someone's
card with tokens and then hastily switch them off to another
character. Whenever real money gets involved though.. i see no
'secure' way that doesn't involve actually tying an in-game account to
a real life person. And i'm talking two forms of identification in a
face-to-face meeting when you setup the account along with public-key
encryption to digitally verify your identity in-game and prevent
man-in-the-middle hacks. That's why a bank would be great... they
allready have quite a bit of this setup, both in RL and online.
