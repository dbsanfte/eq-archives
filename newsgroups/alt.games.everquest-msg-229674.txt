I don't care who thinks it's a superior game for whatever reason. I'm 
not sure if you are getting my point. I tried DAOC and SWG and a couple 
of other games, and they only made me want to play EQ. I was positively 
peeved when they changed the inventory screen to resemble the DAOC 
inventory screen. I hate it when they try to make EQ more like other games.

There are times when the new and improved product may in fact be better 
in all aspects except it's not the original. New Coke anyone? I've had 
to change brands of shampoo and laundry soap because they tinkered with 
the formula to make it better, only to make awful to my perception.

I have zero urge to play a game that is close to EQ but isn't. I don't 
want to play anything else in the same genre. If I'm not playing EQ, I 
don't want anything like it.

The whole concept of starting over and maintaining characters in both 
worlds strikes me as idiocy. I don't have the time or the energy any more.
