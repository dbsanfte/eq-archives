I am currenly having horrible slideshow type freezes in every zone every
minute or so since the last patch. Actually it started when pop came out and
I installed dx9 and it stopped. So I thought it was video . But now since
the last patch it started again and I can't fix it. I was told to run a
tracert and did and timed out trying to connect to both eq sites. One of the
addresses was 10.122.248.1
so I tried a ping in a dos window and timed out again. Now I think its my
connection maybe. I am at my wits end with this. What could it be? I have an
Nvidia card and tried a lot of different drivers and nothing seems to help.
I don't go ld or crash, but just these huge freezes all the time.
Thanks,
                       Linda
