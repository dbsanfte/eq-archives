Otoh, join a ldon group, find out it sucks, and you are kind of stuck with
it.  Was in a group today.  First off half the group zoned in before asking
if everyone was ready, then we proceded to get buffed up inside the dungeon.
Agreed (I thought) that I the bard would lull and pull, but the pally kept
running ahead to pull anyway (dont they get pacify?).  Pally dies in 2nd
room.  Healer says sorry lagged out.  So trying to go ahead while pally
makes it back.  After 2 mobs we see pally is in bazaar.  "hurry up man". So
he *finally* makes it back and after 2 more rooms he runs into a 6 mob room
and starts fighting in the room without any lulls.  Fight started out ok,
but then a walker came through and got most of the other mobs to aggro.  We
wiped.  After that we pretty much agreed to part ways.  I was putting up
with way too much bs just to not be the one to quit and let my groupmates
down.
