<sigh> Well, I've just about had it. I thought I'd give it a while to see if
it was just temporary, but it still happens. About 5 or so times a night, I
go LD. I hardly ever get the "You have been disconnected" black screen. I'll
usually just be playing, then BAM...I'm looking at my Windows desktop. I
thought perhaps it might be a virus. Didn't detect one, but backed things up
and did a wipe and fresh install of my OS and EQ anyway. My first session of
EQ on the fresh computer had 3 of the aforementioned LDs. (EQ was the only
App installed). This wouldn't frustrate me so much, except that Everquest is
the ONLY program I ever have any problems with whatsoever. I have a halfway
decent system.....A Soyo SY-K7V Dragon plus mobo, an Athlon XP 1700+ proc,
640MB Crucial PC 2100 memory, a Ge Force 4 Ti 4200 128MB video card, I EVEN
sprung for the Professional  edition of Windows XP, I have all the latest
updated drivers and BIOSes for my equipment,and a DSL connection that is
fast and as solid as a rock. I never have any connection issues with my DSL
connection, and I have zero packet loss on line tests. So I'm at my wits'
end. I have no clue whatsoever as to what to do to keep from going LD. Does
anyone else have this problem, or know of what the problem behind it might
be? I'd really appreciate any help anyone could give. (btw, I've tried every
page file setting I could think of, from leaving it completely off, to
letting Windows manage, to setting it at a "tweaked" size. Same problem
under all settings. =\
