This is short but...

Being dissapointed with my ability to find a group (or lack thereof) in
Crushbone (I was a level 10 Wizzie at that point) one of my guildmates
offered to bring their high level to 'port me to the freeport area, where
some other guild members were hunting in the Oasis. I figure, cool, I have a
chance to explore another continent and get some mad EXP. After a few hours
of killing undead, various bugs, running from Sand Giants and specters, and
getting to level 11, most of the other guild mates decide it's time they
bring their high-levels in for the Soulsek B Raid.

So I head back to Freeport to get a bind, and realize that my bank is FULL
of CB belts...and a bracer or two, and I have more belts on me. Are they
worth anything in Freeport? They have been my major source of income
throughout my career. Should I destroy them to make room for more loot? Or
should I take a quick trip back to Faydwer and sell 'em (which would be a
pain...) I've been grouping dervishes and such in North Ro for a while, and
plan to head back to the Oasis after I get my 12th level spells. (Yumm,
shock of lightning...)
