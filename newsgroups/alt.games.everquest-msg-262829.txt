This bugs the hell out of me. He has made this statement several times in The
Newbie Zone and I've called him on it every time. He's never responded.

I attended the University of Illinois in the early/mid-70s at which was
developed a pioneering computer-based education system called PLATO. It was
hosted on a multimillion dollar Control Data Corporation mainframe supercomputer
(a Cyber 6600, before the word "cyber" took on a different meaning entirely),
and supported up to 1100 users simultaneously across a proprietary international
network. Average response times were 1/4 second, which was pretty damn good back
then.

This was a graphically-based system. The original proprietary terminal held a
512 x 512 plasma display, developed specifically for PLATO. Dr. Don Bitzer (the
"father of PLATO") developed the plasma display for the system and I believe he
held the patent for a number of years. The flat-screen plasma TVs you see today
are descendents, although the original was monochromatic and required a LOT of
voltage.

To the point, there were, literally, hundreds of single- and multiuser games
developed on that system. One notable PLATO person was the late Silas Warner,
the author of the original Castle Wolfenstein. There are others. Lotus Notes is
a direct descendent of PLATO notes, and we had IM, chatrooms and email. In 1975.
A number of patents have been revoked because "prior art" can be found on PLATO.

History repeats itself. Someone recently developed a CDC Cyber emulator that
runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS-X. Some PLATO aficionados got a hold of the
source, tweaked the emulator a bit, and are running real honest-to-god PLATO on
a $5000 dual Opteron box. Go to www.cyber1.org if you want to learn more about
it.

Sorry this got long-winded, I hope some of you find it interesting.
