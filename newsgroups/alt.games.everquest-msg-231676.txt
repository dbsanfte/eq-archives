What a bizarre thing to think. The people making WoW are a new team at
Blizzard, not responsible for any of the success of previous titles
(nor are any of the people who were still in the company), and has no
experience with mmorpgs, and yet you like them. The EQ2 team you have
no faith in, however, despite the fact they, too, aren't the same team
for the most part as did SWG but they *do* have mmorpg experience, and
successful experience at that.
