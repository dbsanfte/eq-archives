Hrmm... that dire warning on Test about how they had fiddled with
something fundamental is coming to mind all of a sudden.

"Hi folks, just wanted to let everyone know that we are 
making some huge changes on the Test server today.
The changes being made involve a new character file 
format, which means every aspect of an EverQuest 
character could be affected."

I'm glad I /bug reported it. I wonder if I should try re-training all my
other skills once just to see if Kick shows up as an option?
