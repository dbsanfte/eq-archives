Oh c'mon, quit feeling sorry for yourself.  David (who is a post-50
Druid btw) is absolutely on target, "basic" Druid is "easy-mode" EQ.
Until and unless you decide to become a first-rate grouping Druid,
when you have to actually pay attention all the time so that you can
make sure to do <all> the little things right and actually be a major
contributor to your group's success.  Any moron can play solo-pharmer,
weak-imitation-cleric, and port-whore, and most of them do.  When
you've grouped with a really skilled Druid you don't likely know in
detail what it was they did, but you will notice that everything went

a lot better than it did without the Druid.  And guess what, ports

are only a tiny piece of that picture.

I haven't noticed anybody calling Druids overpowered here recently.
In fact, the most recent discussion on Druids was on how to improve
them so that they had more to offer at the top-end of the game than
just being the "port bitch" and having a resist buff that was useful
for a few encounters.  Now here you come whining that you're not so
desireable as a port bitch anymore.  I guess that just goes to show
that no matter what they do to change EQ <somebody> will come out and
whine bitterly about it, even (especially?) when it's an enormous
improvement to the game a a whole.
