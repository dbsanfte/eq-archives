It rather depends on how each they're both hooked up to each other, how TCP 
is configured, (e.g. are you using 2 cable company assigned IPs or are you 
sharing 1 through a router or ICS/Wingate etc), what network protocol 
you're using for them to talk to each other, etc.

I would have a gander at http://www.practicallynetworked.com and try to 
find a step by step guide, or have a look at their troubleshooting section.
