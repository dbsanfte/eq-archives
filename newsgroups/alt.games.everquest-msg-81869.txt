Hi all.  I was wondering if anyone had any info or advice on The Hole.
There is 3 of us that would be doing it, me 40 druid, 48 warrior and a 51
bard.  would this be a good spot for us?  I havent heard people talk much
about this place and hopefully its not a well played spot either.  Im very
tired of the over populated zones.  I would like to have something different
with a challenge and the opportunity to challenge it.  Thanks for reading
and thanks for the advice in advance.  Have a nice day.

Sheri  :)
