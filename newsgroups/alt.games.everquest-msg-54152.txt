I can think of several reasons to go to Thurgadin at a low-level. First,
Thurgadin is probably the best zone for tradeskills in the game.
Second, it's possible to buy a coldain velium weapon for around 100pp
that will proc Velium Shards.   Getting the proc at 25 is useless;  at 11
it's not.   Third, it's possible to go to Icewell Keep (where I think he
died)
and get no-drop armor that people hunting there let rot.  And, lastly,
it's nice just to do it.  Getting to Great Divide isn't all that difficult
at
that level and sometimes it's just nice to play tourist.

As far as participating in the 10th ring battle by getting a poke in,
what's wrong with that?   Sure, he's almost certain to die (even though
he didn't), but EQ is supposed to be fun, and I can't imagine anything
more fun than hanging out in Oasis and chatting in group about how
I backstabbed a 50+ giant in Great Divide a couple of levels ago... ;)
