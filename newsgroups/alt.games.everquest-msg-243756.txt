I have a new MB and Cpu, which usually is not a problem, however. i get the
the character screen and select a charcter to play and usually get a
computer lock up and Reboot.

I have reinstalled Video Drivers and DX9. upgraded the Bios and chipset. I
think the problem may be in the Bios it's award bios,
MB is a SY-K7VMP2 with a Gforce4 Ti 4200 card.

the killer is i can run any other programs but EQ! any suggestions other
than a reformat and install of everything?

Thanks!
