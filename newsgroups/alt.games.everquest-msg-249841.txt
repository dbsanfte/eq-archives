Just did the tutorial with 2 of my chars.. many bugs, too many folks
WONT believe me, sigh..

1st.. didnt realize I was in trouble before the "banker" quest.. never
got backpack and golden token.. (create a char, just to check, talk or
at least attempting to get hints from players doin it, no luck!)
finally convinced a newbie (he has to be, since he is the ONLY one so
trusting!) to hand me backpack, just to try it.. it WORKS!!! just
convince someone to hand you "the" backpack, drop it in bank, pull it
from bank to your inventory.. VOILA!

2nd problem arises with the "merchant".. since I managed to solve the
1st hiccup.. I use trial and error this time.. no need to sell arias
shackle back to him.. just run to bank, grab some plat, buy the kobold
necklace.. VOILA!!

I never got that initial storyline too.. was dumped in, with waterfall
sounds.. cant even hear the speech properly.. but once ur out of that
npc cave and to the spiders/kobolds areas.. those waters sounds will be
gone..

Killed TONS of kobolds.. no plats.. Slavemaster and some other Spider
Tamer named has items.. worthless though, chunk of iron, bronze and
such..

Moral of the story.. yes, you can COMPLETE the charm quest with +5 to
all those stats, even though the quest is broken to some.. sigh, wish
my bst that I started a month ago can do this quest, he would love that
CHARM!
