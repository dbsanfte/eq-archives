/bug it :D

Probably to late for them to fix it though.

Personally, while 'hide traders' worked, it was a stupid hack really. It 
was a workaround that made the zone navigable.

The new bazaar fixes a real problem the old version had.

I'm amazed at how much bitching theres been about this.

Imagine if *this* had been the original bazaar and then sony released 
the old bazaar with a hide traders option.... you'd be up in arms about 
'duming down the game', what? were people so stupid they couldn't walk 
from room to room!? that SOE felt the need to cram everyone into a 
square box?, that it ruins the immersion with the hide traders function,  
that you couldn't see why they didn't leave well enough alone!!

heh... my 0.02.
