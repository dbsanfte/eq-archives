No. As I've said so many times before, though, I play a druid. I get
bombed with tells for ports, buffs, and SOW any time I dare take off
/role or /anon ( I keep /role on for the purpose it was intended for,
actually.). I've been main healer in the group, so I've been yelled at
for trying to loot. ( On the other hand, on my other characters, I've
snapped back at people who yell at the cleric for trying to
loot...I've found, however, that those incidents are *very* rare )

Ports and SOW are actually more commonly demanded than rezzes.
So...how come a cleric can twist arms for 100p per rez, but a druid
gets yelled at for asking more than 15p for a port?

As I said before, I've never even mentioned payment for the ports I
offer until the other guy mentions it first. I've often wound up with
nothing but a "thank you", but I don't sweat it. I port when I'm not
doing anything else important (Or when I'm soloing and the /ooc'd
offer is good). I've never done the "port rounds" that many druids do
(hopping between rings and /auctioning ports for cash). And porting
for a corpse run is always free, and always accompanied by a full
compliment of buffs.

No, I don't expect a cleric to go out of their way to rez someone for
free. But rezzing EXCLUSIVELY for money, and not even considering
doing it for free even if they're not doing anything else at the time
and they're not going out of their way to do it? That's just being a
greedy asshole. Sorry if you don't agree.
