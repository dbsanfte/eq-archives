Interesting point. I have found that I RP my twinked characters much
more than  my non-twinked ones. Not having to worry about getting
decent gear (since gear is almost as important as levels in EQ), takes
a lot of pressure off of a player. It gives you the time to sit back
and actually smell the roses (or orc corpses as the case may be.)
