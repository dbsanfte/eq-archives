The boat you are looking for is in Butcherblock Mountains.  When you come
to the docks you will see a set to the right and one to the left.  You
want to take the righthand boat, it may take a while for it to arrive, but
it will.  Stay on that boat until you zone into freeport.  Those boats are
not steerable (unless something has changed).  Just stay in the middle of
the boat because they are still buggy, always have been and I will assume
they always will be.
