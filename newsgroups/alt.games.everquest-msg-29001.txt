Hiyas

Wow this was strange, I was in Great Divide getting ready to go out and hunt
Drakkal wolves, I was sitting down and medding when all of a sudden a I see
a very large shardwurm heading straight for me. By the time I stood up
swapped camera angles and got ready to run, it was already on top of me.
Expecting to see my HPs rapidly depleting, I manage to start running, but my
HPs werent dropping so I turn around to check and sure enough the wurm was
still right next to me and shouldve be causing me a lot of hurt, but it
wasnt. So I stop to see what was going on, and she walks pass me a little
bit and forms up alongside me, next to my pet. I was dumbfounded. I walked a
bit more towards Thurgadin, and she promtly followed me, and when I stopped
she formed up alongside me and sat there contently - I had my own pet
Shardwurm. I do a /gu and /ooc and asked if anyone knew what the heck was
happening and after a few minutes I had quite the crowd gathered around to
see me and my pet - it was quite impressive. Anyway after about 10 minutes I
was asked to zone into Thurgadin so she would repop and a group could
complete their quest, so I did and she respawned back in her proper place,
but it was quite weird and fun experience.

(I have just done a search at AllaKhazam's site and it was mentioned there,
about this happening as well.)
