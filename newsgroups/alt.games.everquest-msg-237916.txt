Yes, you did.  And probably most of everything else that's been said, to
some extent.  You screwed up, big time.  First, getting so deeply involved.
This is a huge mistake.  No if's, and's or but's.

Second, in trying to keep in contact when it was obvious that she didn't
want it.  You needed to buy a clue and stop.  As soon as she pulled back and
you ignored her rather obvious wishes, you became a (cyber-) stalker.  Even
if she never said "back off, Bud", you owed it to her to respect her wishes.
Especially if you care about her, as you claim.

Third, and imo worst, you contacted the person you believed to be her
husband and decided to spill all.  You had no right to do this.  It's not
your place to insinuate yourself into her marriage or marrital problems.
And to claim that this may have helped is, well, at best, ludicrous.  It may
have been justifiable if she was able to talk you into sending money or
gifts with promises of more, but only barely.

Last, you posted her online names in an effort to trash her.  That was the
response of an immature, emotionally challenged person.  You blew any chance
of sympathy you could have possibly deserved long before that.  This was
just icing on the cake.

You really do need to see a counsellor (either psychologist, psychiatrist,
minister, lay counsellor, or whatever) because you do have a problem.  If
everything is as you claimed, you are at best, obsessive/compulsive and at
worst, capable of a Columbine.  If not, then you still need someone, because
getting your jollies by lying and seeing where it goes is just immature.

In the end, you just need to grow up.  People get jilted all the time.  Many
times without closure or even the most minimal explanation.  You learn to
get over it and move on.

Good luck in life.  I hope you take to heart some of what has been said to
you by many.  Even the jibes, flames and outright ridicule have some merit
and you need to learn from it.
