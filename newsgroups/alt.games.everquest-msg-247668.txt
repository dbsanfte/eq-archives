Nope, no kidding.
When I am on the server is quiet, and therefore if the spawns are based on
zone population then it can take quite a while to find the scales or otehr

The giant bats were really annoying as the few people on must have been
hunting the same thing.

I took the easier option and killed stuff for a little plat and went to the
bazaar :)
