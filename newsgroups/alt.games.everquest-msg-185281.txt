Trouble is, theres a lot of servers for people to come from. If only 1 in 5
guilds decide to move, then with over 25 servers to come from, thats over 5
guilds that will end up on this new server. If the crowding is that bad for
you already, then they probably need a bunch of new servers, and will almost
certainly need more later. Seems to me the crowding at high levels is a
direct result of them making xp so easy to get now. Wonder if SOE are
regretting aspects of their pop expansion.
