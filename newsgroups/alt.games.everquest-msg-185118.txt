Well, there's the goblin ear quest in HHK as well as the gnoll and orc
scalps in Highpass. If you're too high level to hunt there (hunting
tollbooth guards, I'm sure you are), you could always auction in those
zones to buy some. Would probably take an assload to get to dubious,
though. Once you hit dubious, you can turn in orc belts at the militia
house in FP, which will raise your faction a LOT faster. Don't worry
about the negative paladin hits from it, they're tiny.
