Here is some rationalization then...

First off, it was mentioned that, at the beginning of Luclin, that there
were attempts IN PROGRESS to erect means of getting to Luclin easier, but
for the time being the Nexus was the only means to and from the moon for
Norrath at this time.

Next, given the nature of magic, using the Wizard spires to focus their
energies to allow people to go to the moon, and at the time, only in
cycles, the two races that seem fairly focused in the arts of Wizardry and
Druidic powers, being the Dark Elves and the Halflings (Remember, Halflings
are considered the best race for Druids, and while Dark Elves are 2nd
highest in Intelligence, they are mortal enemies of the Halflings) it would
seem that the ability to show dominance on the moon, despite the numbers of
humans, half-elves and Vah-shir already up there, have had them focus on
the means of getting to the moon some other way.  While the wizards have
found ways to get back to nexus, it was limited to only while on the moon.
With further research and divining, they have found a means in order to go
there more effectively.

And what of the Scions?  Their service is still in need, even though the
powers of the Wizards and Druids have grown so they now can travel to the
moon unhindered like before, the rest of the classes are still hindered by
this fact, and that the druids and the wizards themselves are, by no means,
preventing the services of the scions.

(Side note:  Just because there isn't a big story about it, doesn't mean
one cannot make up one, or that there isn't one to explain it.  At the same
time, there are about a billion stories being formed around the world on
various things...  We only get a snapshot of some of them through the news.
To expect a lot of information in a short span of time would be, in and of
itself, time consuming.)
