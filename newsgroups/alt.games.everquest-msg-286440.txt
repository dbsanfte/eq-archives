Aye.  This dovetails nicely with another thread going on at the moment,
reminding folks that it's good to periodically check the choices listed
under the Options --> Keys window.

It's also good to periodically reread the FAQ. :-)  Question 8.3, "corpses
and other targets" under Miscellaneous Tips, includes a mention of the
"cycle through available targets" keys.  Note that I say "keys" plural,
because you can also set one up for PCs.  (Not as necessary as for NPCs,
but still occasionally handy when trying to target one PC in a crowd.)

FWIW, I chose to assign those functions to alt-F8 and alt-F7, since they
cycle through the alternatives for F8 and F7 targetting.  But then, due
to my growing up with keyboard-only computers (before the days of screens
and mice), I'm accustomed to UIs where shift/ctrl/alt are used as
modifiers, sometimes in combinations.
