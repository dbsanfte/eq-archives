Probably. Still, from the way she said "but you don't sound like him" I 
got the feeling it may  have been someone who had met him before (this 
was in Los Angeles, after all), but wasn't close enough to him to have 
his home number. Then again, I don't know much about groupies... people 
in my line of work don't get them. :)
