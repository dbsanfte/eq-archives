No, it's quite polite, if a bit wordy.  The problem is that I hate getting
unsolicited tells asking for KEI.  It's usually people on the other side of
the zone who either expect me to drop what I'm doing and go to them, or who
expect me to stop where I am so that they can come to me, and oh yeah, I
gotta hit these 5 vendors and the bank on the way to you, hang on, I'm
almost there. On occaision, it's people in other zones who somehow expect me
to either come to them or wait around while they come to me.

Rarely, I can /rt and target them immediately. Those people I will generally
buff, because the impact on my time has been minimal (and yes, it's all
about my time).  Unless you're a level 20-something druid who looked up my
name on /who all, ported yourself to Feerrott, invised yourself, tracked me
down in my planks group in Cazic Thule, and THEN asked for KEI.  You get
nothing.  (True story)

Also, you aren't the only person sending /tells.  My chat window turns
purple with /tells every time I zone into Nexus.

KEI takes 900 mana to cast.  That's a tad over one quarter of my mana load. 
That means 3 or 4 casts, and I'm OOM. And you can never cast it just once in
Nexus.  People see that "time and space" message and start getting really
pissy if you don't get them as well.

But the worst part of KEI is that people will get it, and then pass over
lower-level enchanters for groups because they think that they don't need an
enchanter.  After all, they'll have KEI for the next 2 and a half hours.  As
if Clarity is the only thing we do.
