With Dragons of Norrath, SOE took some extra time to find
and kill bugs, making for a relatively smooth rollout. With
Depths of Darkhollow, they slid back to their old hasty ways,
pushing the new expansion out too soon. The first build they
attempted to load up was essentially unplayable; a few builds
later, some monster missions had such an uber risk/reward-time
balance no one would do anything else, knowing the missions
would be nerfed.
  Conventional wisdom is that this is the way it will be from here
on out. SOE is ultimately a business; they can fix broken content
and update outdated stuff, but they can't really charge for that.
To get more money out of players, they have to offer all-new
zones, encounters, and equipment. Unless, maybe, they can find
a way to say "Pay $50 and the LDoN merchants will start carrying
200 hp/mana gear."

  Unfortunately, I was late to discover the value of the werewolf
mission; I only got about a dozen ZZ's for Adas, when I could
have had three dozen. One person in my guild got 72 AA's;
others, running straight XP, went from level 66 to 69. We now
have only one notable member still not able to zone into RSS,
and he can be bought up within a few days. Watch out, Chailak!
  Before the final fix, my nuke crits seemed to be broken; they
wouldn't fire as often as I was used to, as if the ones affecting
crit frequency were not working. That seems to have been dealt
with, and I'm getting crits as often as before. With the new
DoD AA's, Tears of the Sun waves now crit for 2920. Gelidin
Comet and Thundaka will go to 9000 without flappy focus, 9400
with.
  I also got two levels of Gift of Mana, which I now want back.
When it goes off, I have to fire another DD immediately to take
advantage; I am now experienced enough to know I usually
don't want to do this. Aggro management is more important,
and any spell, DD or not, will terminate the Gift of Mana proc.
I'd rather have Quick Damage, which I'm working on now.

  The new zones are nice. Music is interesting; Corathus Creep
music isn't creepy, but rather more suited to Ak'anon, evoking
gnomework bots. Undershore music IS creepy, evoking things
skittering in the dark, water dripping from the ceiling. Stoneroot
Falls they seemed to have aimed for the sound of having ripped
off some old Journey to the Center of the Earth movie. I won't
venture into the Hive or Ruins of Ilsallin without a full group;
mobs are a mixture of living and undead, and the trash hit for 1100.

  The idea of playing as a monster could be revolutionary; instead
of the LFG tool showing doznes of necros, rangers, and mages
and a distict lack of healers, slowers, tanks, or some comination
thereof, a group can be foremed with arbitrary classes, everyone
changing to some suitable monster form for a balanced group.
As implemented, it dosen't quite work out this way; the tank
monsters aren't as good as they are during the monster missions,
the cleric monsters don't heal for as much as player clerics, and
pullers can't feign death until the later shouds are unlocked.
A lack of slowers might be made up for among monster classes,
I'll have to see about their effectiveness, but for now the monsters
are a nice novelty that won't help you survive in the zones you
need to be grinding in to develop characer levels and AA's.
For some people, that counts as Another Useless Expansion.
