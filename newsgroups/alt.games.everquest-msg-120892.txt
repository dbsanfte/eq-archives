Yes, you are a knight class, therefore you miss a lot.

The lower caps on Offense and weapon skills for Paladin and SK (vs.
other melees) get most of the way to our "75% of Warrior damage output"
melee "balance" target.  In fact, I would guess that the main reason we
also get weaker "damage tables" post-50 is because our weapons seem to
have better stats than other melee's weapons (except maybe monk
weapons?) so they have to gimp us again in order to hold us down to
the chosen as our "balance" target.

Rangers can't tank as well, so they are allowed to roughly match
Warriors in damage output, which leads directly to the ever popular
"Ranger Down!" hotkey as lower AC/HP combined with roughly equal melee
taunt (dual wielding fast weapons) makes them very attractive targets
to the mobs.

Beastlords I don't know much about, but apparently they are almost
totally pet dependent for damage output, so if you see a pet class
"nerf" in the near future it'll probably be because Verant thinks the
latest pet class enhancement made BLs too effective for a hybrid.

Bards have severe melee restrictions:  no double attack and no two-
handers, but that doesn't stop them from being the most powerful class
in the game when played well.  If it was easy to play a Bard well they
would be whacked by the ol' nerf bat in a fashion not seen since Verant
decided to put a stop to the plague of soloing Necros carpeting Norrath
for a while a couple years back.
