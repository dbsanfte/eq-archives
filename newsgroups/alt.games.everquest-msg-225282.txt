Wake up hon, you're having a bad dream.

My 55 ogre, which atm is training 100% AA, get 25-27% of an AA point in 
LDoN groups. This means about 3-4 kills per 1%.

In e.g. PoN I get 1% per kill. So in a good group with hardly any med 
breaks I can get almost 90% of AA in 90 minutes and in LDoN I would only 
get 25% in same time.
