Risk is definitely a large reason for the existence of the book - and it's
better than a graphical rendering of closed eyes. Could be worse, I think I
remember at one time being stopped from using /say and /tell while
meditating. Now *that* was annoying. And at least you can watch battlespam
drift past...

And remember, there's got to be a palpable difference between sitting and
meditating (til 35).

Picture a black screen with just the chat/buff windows visible, to emulate
closed eyes required for meditation. I prefer the book.
