I'm of the same temperament. I must admit to never having tried but the
thought of PvP makes me shudder.
Although I have nothing but praise for FV (well, a few minor things I don't
like), I do think that it could be a problem for people with little
experience from playing on 'normal' servers and feel that you would be far
better off getting some experience there first. I have a 32 druid on FV and
the problems I find are language, reduced bind points, reduced auction
points and the inability to find a group. The latter probably shouldn't
worry me (1,000 druids are already pounding at their keyboards), certainly
from the action perspective but it does from the socialising aspect. I am
fortunate enough to speak/understand French and their is an excellent chat
channel on FV for that (francofv) but, if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't
have any social life on that server. I find that it is almost impossible to
find a group. I have been the only person in FM (yes, I know there are other
places to hunt) for hours on end sometimes and I sit around most of the
time, recovering from the last mob. With two of you, that probably wouldn't
be so much of a concern though. The language problems can be solved thru
chat channels to a great extent and I have found that emoting can help too
(as a Halfling, if I talk in Human no one understands me but, if I emote in
Human, they do understand me which, of course, may be associated with the
skill level in that language). The inability to bind anywhere reduces my
effectiveness considerably. I haven't played a druid before but I know from
having played other characters with that ability that it can be a godsend. I
really don't understand it's (reduction) relevance to role playing. It's
part of the 'role' of a druid on any other server and if the different
races/classes are considered level there, in effect druids et al are made
less level by reducing the effectiveness of one of their attributes. The
reduced auctioning is also a problem I find and I really don't understand
it's relevance to role playing. With it restricted to cities (and FV, the
city, isn't considered to be a city????) it makes a chore out of getting
reasonable gear.

No, no, it's not a no-no, just restricted. See above

Each to their own. I have never joined a guild in 16 characters but I can
understand the benefits of doing so. You don't really need to participate in
anything, even if you do join, just buff someone for free with the same tag
after their name and you can benefit from the additional communication
option of guild chat and offset the limitations of the reduced auctioning
capability. In fact, I would say that it is probably the most appropriate
server on which to join a guild.

You're lucky. You have a ready made group. In my experience, it is very,
very diffcult to get pick-up groups on FV. OK, perhaps I'm a lousy player
but I have sat outside the Sarnak Fort in LoIO and watched two blues (to me)
pulling and killing sarnaks at more than three times the rate that I can, by
myself, which can be a bit soul destroying.
