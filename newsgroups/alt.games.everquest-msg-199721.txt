This is exactly what I was thinking.  In PoV the other day we got
a 3 pull (damn ranja!) and the cleric went down before the 'chanter
got control of the situation.  I didn't have CoH up - and anything
that could reduce the fumbling while I got it ready and he zoned
in would have been helpful :)

He memmed a couple heals, zoned in, I CoH'd and he caught the 
MA before he dropped - and we took everything out  :)
