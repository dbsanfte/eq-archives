But wait, there's more.

As I thought it over, I became more and more irritated about the sound
card I'd bought - the part where most of the features of the card
(like four speaker support) didn't actually work under Win2k, and that
this isn't prominently displayed on the box.

So yesterday I bought a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz card. The initial test
with EQ was better than the SBLive, but not as good as the Seismic
Edge. The quality of the sounds was good, but about every twenty
seconds or so, the sound would pause.

I've since installed newer drivers and made some tweaks but haven't
yet tested again with EQ.

I also bought DaoC yesterday, in which the sound seems fine. I'm going
to have to spend a few days getting the hang of the controls before I
have any idea if I like the game, though.
