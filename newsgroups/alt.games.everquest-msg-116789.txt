As a side note, the necro I tend to group with has made a hotkey that says,
in group, Regen down.  I've made a hotkey that /targets him, /sit off, /gsay
Casting Regen on %t, then /cast 4....  Makes things a lot simpler...  Heh..
but then, I tend to make hotkeys for everything..  I even have a hotkey for
foraging...  /sit off, /doability 1, /sit  :)
