If you think that's bad, try accidentally adding a friend named "all"...

Yes, you can add it.  No, you can't remove it.

My wife did that by accident (she had typed "/friend all" when she
meant "/who friend all"), and I had to use a binary editor to
tweak her eqOptions1.opt file, modifying the name "all" to "xyz",
at which point it could then be removed in-game by the usual method.
