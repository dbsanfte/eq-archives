Which zone is that off of, now?  I remember a time it was near the High elf
city but then was moved to Kunack (or something like that).

The effect has been explained, before, iirc.  Mobs that start casting in
range can complete their casting without the range effects.  You could be at
twice the normal range of the spell when it hits.  It's one of the
advantages that mobs are given to overcome the limitations of the AI (such
as stacking 2 mobs in the same space, warping through walls while you need
to run around them, etc.)
