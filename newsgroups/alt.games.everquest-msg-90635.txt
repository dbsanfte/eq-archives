Nah, you probably just have a higher tolerance for lower frame rates than I
do.  People's eyes are different and it's quite possible I notice it before
you do. *shrug*

I was basing my answer assuming the thread starter has the same tolerance I
do.  So were you.  For his sake I hope that you're closer to his mark than I
am, but if he's going to upgrade his video card it'd be extremely stupid to
buy a 32MB card (GF2MX400) for $48+shipping (www.pricewatch.com) instead of
a 64MB (GF2MX400) for $49+shipping, and for another $25 he could have a
GF2Ti (DDR RAM) and probably the best card under $100.
