If the mace is 9/18, then it has a better ratio than defiance, which
is 9/19.

Defiance of course, has some nice AC on it.

Don't worry about haste since it should affect all ratios
equivalently.  Just look at this:

Defiance without damage bonus: 9/19
Defiance with damage bonus of 8: 17/19
Secondary hand ratio: 0.47
Primary hand ratio: 0.89

Defender's Lightblade without damage bonus (and limited by level):
20/34
Defender's Lightblade With bonus of 8: 28/34
Secondary hand ratio: 0.59
Primary hand ratio: 0.82

You only get the bonus on your primary weapon.  As you can see, the
Defiance has a better ratio in primary than DL, and DL has a better
ratio in offhand than Defiance.  It isn't even a contest.  In fact, if
you ever see anyone with Defender's Lightblade in primary, they don't
know what they are doing, since it can't really be used as a twink
weap.

Nah the Lightblade is a great offhand weapon.  Just remember that
since your primary will swing more often than secondary, you may want
to try and spend at least as much time improving that weapon as you
will improving the secondary.
