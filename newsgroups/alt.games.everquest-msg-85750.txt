There are probably a few in the impolite to inspect camp that are just as
rabid about it.  There are always a few folks that get that way, regardless
of which side of the issue they are on.  Robin does appear to be on of them.

That being said, I feel it is impolite, I don't go flying into a rage when s
omeone inspects me without asking, I don't say a word, I just continue
playing, thinking that that person is a bit rude.  Oh well, there are a lot
of rude people in the world.  I also realize that he may not think it is
rude.  I ask before I inspect, if it bothers you that much Robin, maybe you
should seek some professional help at around $100 an hour.
