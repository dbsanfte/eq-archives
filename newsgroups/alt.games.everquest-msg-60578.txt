I upgraded to WIN XP and had to do the following to get Q# to run.

WINXP has a driver for my ATI card but it does NOT support Open GL. Had to
download the latest driver from the ATI web site.

In the meantime I did a uninstall fro both Q3 and Q3TA.  Still no luck.
I tried point release 1.27 and 1.29f.  Finally when I installed 1.30 the
game came back to life.

Looks like point release 1.30 is the only one to work on XP
