well if we are going to shout about it;

NO, IT IS A PERMANENT EFFECT as I know, I have had 2 of them...you will also
hear this from others, I am sure.

Doesn't proc at all, it's a permanent effect.
You seem to be confusing it with either the Executioners axe or Earthen
blade (proc at 30th and 25th respectively)

As the log only times to the nearest second (not tenths, as is required) I
can't see how this can be more accurate...
The only way I can imagine would be in a one sided (ie opponent does not
fight back and turns back on me) duel. Then do it over a period of time and
calculate it that way. As I didn't have anyone who was actually interested
available to do this I used mobs (green ones but ones that would survive a
few swings)

I'll repeat..The Mith 2hder has a permanent effect of haste, if it proc'd,
every now and again the wielder would appear to cast a spell upon themselves
and a haste icon would appear as a buff (as with both the Exe axe and
Earthen Blade) this does not happen with the Mith it just has an effective
delay almost a second faster then is shown.
