Actually, you just change which vendors to check.  The most-used vendors 
(LDoN Mages, the ones near the port in in PoK, the ones in bazaar) can 
fill up in hours.  But zones with a lot of vendors, or more out-of-the-way 
spots can still be not full after a couple weeks.  So a few days after the 
patch, start checking one city a night.  Freeport and Gukta seem to fill 
up the fastest.

Some merchants can also be reset.  Try doing the ore quest on the merchant 
in the bazaar, then check his stock about 15-20 minutes later. :)
