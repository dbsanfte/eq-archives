 I saw this too and I really wish the media  wouldn't do things like that.
The flag at Iwo Jima was raised after a hard won victory during World War

There is no pride in being slaughtered by a group of serial killers,

I will feel proud when they raise the American flag over the body
of Osama  Bin Laden
