OK, I finally got to see the show about EQ addicts.  I must say it was
typical one-sided tripe.

The woman who's son killed himself was more pathetic than I had imagined
from reading the story when it first came out in the news.  She says Sony
won't help her and "someone out there knows what happened" and won't come
forward, and she "just wants to know".  Bullshit.  They went through his
computer and found that the last character he played was called "Iloveyou".
Therefore he had his /log on.  I'm sure this contained more information than
anything Sony could have ever produced.  This bitch knows what happened.

However, it would have been nice for them to add that the leading cause of
death in young males is suicide.  Also, I remember when I first read about
this story on the internet that she had acknowledged that he had been
diagnosed with mental issues as a teenager.  However on this program they
only mentioned post-EQ evaluation.

The single mother-of-4 who plays the moment the kids are asleep I can relate
to, yet I don't play as much as she does.  I get up at 5 am and work all day
which doesn't stop when I get home, tending to the kids until they are in
bed (hey, I'm a parent.  It's my job) so DAMMIT, I DESERVE TO DO WHAT I LIKE
AT NIGHT!!!!

I had to watch the show (a few days late) over the internet.  I missed it
when it was on TV.  I heard it a little bit in the other room but I couldn't
tear myself away from NHL 2002.  Should I sue Electronic Arts?

SEAN...
