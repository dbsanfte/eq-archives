It would help if we knew what level spells you're looking for.  For the
past week I've been hunting Ulthorks in EW, and enchanter pages have
been dropping like water. Given the level of the mobs, I would guess
they are for 30's level spells. They also drop like mad in the Hole
entry area, doubtless for higher level spells. Oasis, IIRC, dropped tons
of runes, words and pages for the lowest level spells.
