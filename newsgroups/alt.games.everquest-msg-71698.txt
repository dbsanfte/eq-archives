Hehe, jsut spent half a day escorting newbies through Paludal Caverns, could
make a business with twinks out of this :-).

Made it OK all through Paludal, Shadeweaver, Hollowshade (and yes the
owlbears are tough, even at green for me they hit hard, not really any
threat of beating me though), Grimling Forest, Tenebrous all OK.  Then of
all places that you would least expect a lvl 44 Paladin to die - Katta
Castellum.  Yeah, found this little alcove leading down to what appeared to
be 'downtown', and didn't look down - Oops.  That is quite a drop let me
tell you :-).  Lost my level too.

Fortunately one of my guild mates cleric was camped in Katta so I was able
to be rezzed.
