yes, I do know of our other abilities, but as you may know its not
often to have 2 clerics in an exp group.  Oh yes it does happen and if
Im the lucky one to be the battle cleric  Whoot... but all too often
one cleric.  gots ta save da mana for the heals and buffs.

I do not blame the class for my boredom....  I have much more enjoyed
playing my monk up to this level, but he was also twinked.  My cleric
is seriously lacking equipment, and most upgrades will be in the
multiple K items.  Which he does not in any way or shape have.
