The boat through Timorous Deep which leaves from Oasis  (The Bloated Belly)
doesnt got to FV, It goes to The Overthere. Actually its just a raft that
leaves from oasis, you must then travers the ogre island to the dock to get
the boat. So long as you get off the boat before it docks in OT, you can
swim ashore without any problem. You can then travel from OT to Frontier
Mountains, then by hugging the left wall, get to loio. Be careful in FM,
some Mobs are close to the wall , so hugging the wall isnt 100% safe.

The boat which lands in FV leaves from Butherblock.
