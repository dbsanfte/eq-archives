Druids.

Wait wait wait...  Your daughter is a druid...  And felt useless around Ice
Giants?  Gee...  What is the Shield of Spikes/Thorns for then?  STR buff
for the Tanks, Invigor so the healer conserves Mana for Healing as well as
an evacer...  Plus, just cause they had a wizard in there...  Doesn't mean
she can't nuke once in a while.
