Because, of course, as we all know, kids raised in a two parent (one male,
one female) are all wonderful, polite, well behaved, and get good grades.
While those poor kids that have to make do with just one parent, of course,
all turn out to be misbehaving impolite idiots with poor grades.

I do occasionally find reason to be pro retroactive choice in this newsgroup
however.  :b
