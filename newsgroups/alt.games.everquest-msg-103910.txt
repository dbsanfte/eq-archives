Hmmmm, I was wondering about that.  I had never had a problem being 
dropped off there, but I know it scared me to death until I realized that 
the mobs weren't aggro.  I guess if you happen to load right as a roamer 
walks by it would be an issue.  At least in my case the one time I almost 
died was due to popping up surrounded by 3 mobs and immediately going into 
bardic panic mode and running, the exact wrong way.
