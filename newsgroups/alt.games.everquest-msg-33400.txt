Somehow I don't think the groups are made up of nothing *but* a bard, a 
chanter, and a cleric. *g*  (Well, unless the bard is really really 
REALLY good I suppose...)

Sounds overcrowded to me.  I'd look for a quieter zone.  I went to LOIO, 
stayed there exactly one day, and went back to Antonica.  Less 
competition, and the loot was pitiful anyway.  As for the 'masses of 
exp', well that would depend on you finding a good group.  And DAMN is it 
hard to find a good group in the mess over there.

And will you still say that when people are stealing *your* camps?  Or 
when you're not invited in groups or into guilds or on raids because 
you're a camp stealer?

I don't know what it's like at higher levels, but I've NEVER had this 
problem.  If all the camps are full and I don't feel like waiting, I 
check the next zone.  If I do want to wait, I communicate with the groups 
and ask them to please let me know if a spot (or the whole camp, of 
course) opens up.  Or, lots of times, instead of sending out a general 
"LFG" shout to the zone, I take the initiative, *find* the group, check 
how many are around and how the group is working (if there are a lot of 
dead bodies around, I tend to run away - especially if the dead bodies 
are multiples of the same group members ;) ) and if they're empty of a 
spot, I *ask* if they need another member.  I've not been turned down 
yet.

And there's a good reason for that, too.

Say it with me, now:

"Norrath is a big, BIG world."

Now go here:

Isn't it easier to find yourself a new place to hunt, rather than 
screwing your reputation and your grouping/guilding ability?  Especially 
if you're at the level that Karnor's Castle suggests.  You can't exactly 
solo.  And even if you start a group/guild of bad-rep camp stealers, 
you're going to have to suffer from people stealing *your* camps right 
back, as well as the idea that unless there's a few of you at the same 
level on at the same time quite constantly (ha ha in a new guild, 
speaking from experience), grouping is still going to be extremely tough.

Respect the camp, and move on.
