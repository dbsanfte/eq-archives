I know this is not a bug, but it's irritating.  Singing and percussion
skills go up with no problem, however once we get wind and brass it takes
forever to get these two skills up to par.   I sat in a safe place and blew
my horn with DDD and didn't get a single point in brass during a 3 hour trip
to the mall.  I got my wind up to around where my singing and percussion
were, but I had to start blowing a wind with invis song for almost 9 hours
(I just let it go overnight).
My only question is, once I get them up to par with my other skills will it
be easier for these skills to go up or am I going to have to occasionally
"perform some more unattended concerts" while afk?

TIA,
Sean...
