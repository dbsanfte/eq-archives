TallFoolOne,

The effect of a successful Taunt is to give you aggro/hate equivalent to
whoever is at the top of the aggro list, plus one.  If I have 500 aggro and
you get a successful Taunt off, you now have 501.  Taunting several times
before waking up a mezzed mob is just giving you a better chance of having
Taunt work at all - taunt works about thirty percent of the time, depending
on level and your Taunt skill.  Three taunts successful taunts will leave
you with 503 taunt (first putting you at 501, second adding one, third
adding one).  It won't leave you with significantly more aggro than a single
successful taunt.  And my first nuke or slow (depending on which toon I'm
playing) will put me up to around 700 and the mob is back to whacking the
robe instead of you.  This is why any caster, including Knights, can
out-taunt any warrior.  Returning to my previous scenario, the most aggro
you can give yourself is 503 before the mob is awakened, and that takes
quite a while as we wait for Taunt to reset.  A Knight can walk up to that
mob, Taunt, smack it with a Stun for around 250 aggro and be at 750 before
waking the mob up with a tasty nuke or DoT.  (Please note, all numbers above
are hypothetical EXCEPT the fact that Taunt takes you one point over whoever
is on top, which is well documented elsewhere.)

But Taunting when you already have the mob's attention is pointless; adding
a single point of aggro is silly.  Better by far to kick and bash (or
whatever else you can do to generate hate) and keep Taunt ready; if someone
gets a huge bump of aggro (by slowing, or with a big nuke) you can use Taunt
to bump yourself up to the top again.

And yes, if you're close enough to a mob, you can pull with Taunt.  The
reason that sometimes it takes three to four and other times one is because
taunt is not always successful.  There will be nobody on the aggro list, so
you'll give yourself 1 point of hate - a very soft aggro, nearly useless; a
medding cleric will divert the mob.  You're better off using an arrow or
thrown weapon, which will generate FAR more aggro even if it misses.
