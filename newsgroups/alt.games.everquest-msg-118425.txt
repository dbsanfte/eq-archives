I use up to 4 accounts at once on my cable connection. I monitor the 
bandwidth usage and have noticed that when one account is in use, with a 
datarate of the default 5, the average download bandwidth consumption is 
in the range of 1 to 1.5KBps. Upload is less. Going from these figures 
you could theoretically use up to 3 accounts at once on a 56k modem 
(which usually handle around 5KBps download) before you start seeing 
packet loss or latency.

This is in theory though, I haven't tried it :)
