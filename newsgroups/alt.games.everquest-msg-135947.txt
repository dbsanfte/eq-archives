Do you really expect to be taken seriously when you post statements
like this?  The generalist casters have a strong role in the game,
even if they don't always have as strong a role in particular raids
as you think they ought to.  The knights and the Rogue were so broken
early on that they couldn't get a group at any level except out of
ignorance or pity (or friendship maybe, but I think most of those
cases were just disguised pity).

Actually, looking back on it, I find it slightly amazing that they
managed to have the Rogue be so badly broken and so easy to fix (Evade
and the Hide/Sneak upgrade), given how many different upgrades it took
to "balance" the knights.
