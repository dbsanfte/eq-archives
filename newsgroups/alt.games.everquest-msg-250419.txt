Way back when, I re-rolled my FV character as a Druid, because my family
guild needed more porters.  After weeks of leveling up, when I was right
on the cusp of getting group ports...PoP came out.

My guild didn't need porters anymore.  All that work...for nothing.  I
found that it was hard to even *give* ports away.  "No thanks, I'll take
the books."

Does that count as a nerf to the Druid class?  I'm not sure that it matters
whether or not it's considered a nerf...  It sure bummed me out, though.

/agree

Druids are a favorite class envy/punching bag, though, so don't expect
any sympathy (except from me :).  I kept hoping we'd see NPC rezzers and
NPC KEI'ers and NPC buffers to see how all those other classes would feel
about it...  I bet they'd change their "quit whining, druids and wizards"
tune VERY quickly...
