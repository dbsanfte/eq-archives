Stun and flash of light would still have gotten them summoned and killed,
since they would raise the paladins way above where they should be on the
aggro list.  They also wouldn't have had the main benefit of LH...  which
was to keep the warrior who was tanking it healed.

The problem is keeping the warrior, the Main Tank, alive until he has built
up sufficient aggro that the mob won't attack the clerics for complete heal.
Lay hands does this by taking some of the healing burden off of the clerics.
Druids and Shaman should also have been patch healing, to delay the start of
the complete heals.  Since the cleric can CH multiple times, and the paladin
only once...  from a healing perspective, it's much better to lose a paladin
or two than a cleric or two from early healing aggro.
