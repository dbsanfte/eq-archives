}Not being in a guild, let alone leading one, I've never really given

}given what they <could> do.

No, an important member of the guild left the other day.  The only way the 
guildleader knew was because I told him so, and the only way _I_ knew is 
because they accidentally typed '/guild remove' instead of 
'/guildremove'.  I couldn't believe she was gonna leave without even  
saying goodbye. :/

I think a /guildmembers command would be awesomely useful.  I can see 
where it might be hard, but I can also see some other workarounds... 
There's a nice guild database at www.guildmagic.com.  wouldn't it be nice 
if we had something like that at the everquest.com site, that got updated 
from the database, even if it was only updated once a patch or something.

The problem with the guildmagic site, of course, is getting everyone to go 
add their characters...  I tried to get our guild on there, and now the 
only characters on it are either mine or the guildleader's. That also 
makes our guild deceptively small looking.  We are pretty small, but not 
_that_ small...
