Because outside buffs not only screw things up when they are too high 
level, but even when they are appropriate.  In EQ1 at a low level, for 
example, many classes could solo happily if they could get a SOW.  No 
need for them to group with a druid or shaman to get one, though, 
because they could just get one cast on them.  I remember that happening 
way back before Kunark release even.  And even at high levels, getting a 
KEI and Virtue meant you had a lot less need or use for an Enchanter or 
Cleric; you could use other means of CC (including single pulling plans) 
and other means of healing, that came from classes with more to offer in 
an actual fight.

Aye, thats a lark, and I'm sure I'd miss it a bit.  But I wouldn't miss 
the PLing that goes on when people abuse the ability to casually do 
this, and I wouldn't miss seeing class discrimination that results from 
the practice, and I wouldn't miss the level 1 people running around with 
Temp on, and I wouldn't at all miss seeing people run off to get a KEI 
before joining a group or lookind down on someone who failed to do so.
