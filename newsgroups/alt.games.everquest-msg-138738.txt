Save out your OPT and INI files from the EQ directory, at least. No
point in rebuilding them from scratch.

I went through this same process about two weeks ago - full wipe,
format, and reload. The total time to install EQ and all expansions,
and download all patches, was just under one hour.

Took a good deal more than that to reinstall my compiler and all my
programming tools.

You'll be happy having a clean install to work with. One thing,
though, that I ran into which has a small chance of applying to you as
well... the RAM I bought, though rated at 333MHz, caused all kinds of
problems when I ran it at that speed. I had to slow the memory bus
down to 266MHz to get stable performance. I replaced that ram with a
module from Mushkin, and it's solid at full speed.
