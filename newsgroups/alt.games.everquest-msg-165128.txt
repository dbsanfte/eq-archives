Do you have any evidence at all that meditation increases post 60? There
are no skill raises, so it would seem your statement is baseless.

On the other hand, after the last few weeks of leveling our guild took a

difference in power was obvious, with a mainly melee based force.
(exping since PoP release means no weapon upgrades)
