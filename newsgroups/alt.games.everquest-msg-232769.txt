What has worked well for me is not to upgrade anything unless things
stop working, or there is a *very* good evidence to believe that the
upgrade will work better (stability, performance, etc.).  Sony has
never suggested that anyone upgrade to DX9, and I won't do it until
they release an upgrade that requires it.

AND, I've seen several reports of it not working as well as DX8.1 from
several EQ users, including my wife who painfully backed out an
accidental upgrade to DX9 and restored DX8.1.  For Win98SE, at least,
backing down to a previous release of DX* isn't something you're
supposed to be able to do, so we had to locate a program on the web
that would do all the proper fiddling to restore DX8.1.  Microsoft is
frankly an idiot for not providing a mechanism to restore a previous
release of DX*... it just boggles my mind why they do such a thing. 
One way changes to a system, unless the user is made aware of it in no
uncertain terms, should just not be allowed.  There oughta be a law!
