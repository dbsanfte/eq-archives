Actually there have been several instances where ShowEQ users have
caught bugs unknown (or ignored) by Verant (such as Humans having 0
Exp-Bonus, and Halflings having a 5% bonus); caught Verant in a lie
about how game mechanics work; and documented non-spawning rares when
Verant has insisted that there is nothing wrong with the spawn rate of
the given mob.

I don't believe for a minute that they did this to "give back to the
community", but there is a positive side to ShowEQ. It keeps the
developers honest.
