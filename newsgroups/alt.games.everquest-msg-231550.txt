As a cleric, it is never your job to keep robes alive.  Main or alt, 
they shouldn't be getting aggro, and if they are taking damage from 
"other means (AE)" then one of the lesser healing classes should be 
assigned to them.

Clerics keep the MT alive.  Anything else is a waste of mana and healing 
potential in most circumstances.

In a high AE environment, the fact that clerics are also the best group 
healer may mean that they are responsible for keeping their groups 
alive... but still not any one robe.

If you aren't the MT, (or on Rampage or set up as Offtank or something 
like that) you should NOT get aggro.  Aggro is bad, its sometimes a raid 
killer.  Death is a good way to lose aggro and teach that lesson, both 
at the same time.

In a group, things are different; the cleric might be the only healer, 
at any rate he's practically guaranteed to have the fastest heals.  And 
the situation probably isn't such that you need 100% cleric 
concentration on the MT, and a little sloppiness in aggro control isn't 
a big deal usually.

Further, I'm with you on the bot thing; bots can be a handy way to boost 
up a raid or group if you dont' have "real" characters to do it, but if 
they are screwing up because of their bot nature, they can be worse than 
not having that character there at all.

Oh, one other caveat.  I said Robes (as you did) but I also meant 
clerics, shaman, druids, and to a lesser extent monks, rogues, rangers, 
and Anyone else that isn't designated as taking damage.

But I -didn't- mean enchanters.  Forget the MT, in a group or small raid 
it may well be more important to keep the chanter alive than anyone, and 
  while it might not be something you -can- do (if you are in a CHeal 
chain for example), if you can you are probably best at it due to fast 
fast heals.

(bard too, in the rare instance where your bard is mezzer, and perhaps 
shaman, where your shaman is forced to slow so early he gets slow aggro- 
he has a legit reason to be beat to a pulp, although he can probably 
handle himself)

Back to the Bot Mage.  If the mage can't at a minimum send his pet, then 
he isn't actually there for any intents and purposes... well unless 
perhaps you brought him along solely to COTH people in.  Rarely does 
sending pet and doing nothing else ever get the mage aggro, even on pet 
death, unless the pet was off-tanking an add.
