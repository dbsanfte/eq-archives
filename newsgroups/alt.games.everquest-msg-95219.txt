Finally (long overdue) started working on HS keys for our usual hunting
group. Still need to see the chancellor for Jade prods. *sigh*. Anyway,
I have several questions I'm hoping for help with before our first group
trip in there.

I'm assuming that, much like Seb, every person going needs a key to get
in through the tomato in OT, right?

Next, as to these no-rent keys that you need to move through the various
wings, please tell me that one per group is enough, yes? I'm thinking
more like ToFS where one group member can get the whole bunch through.
Or do we need a no-rent key for every member of the group? (Assuming we
dont' get a rogue.)

I read that you have to start with the North wing. Is that wing
unlocked, at least? If not, where's the key to it.... ground spawn, drop
off an entry mob? 

Are the key drops random in the various wings, or always off a
particular keyholder mob? EQAtlas seems to indicate that some keys are
ground spawn. Accurate? 

Also heard they dont' all look like keys, but may be daggers or
somesuch. How do I tell when I have a key?

Assuming you fight your way through the whole North wing (or any other
one I suppose) and you get to the zone out, where does that deposit you?
Back outside in OT?

If you *don't* want to leave, do you just have to fight your way back to
the zone in area with your keys then unlock the door to the next wing
and start moving in?

We'll try to avoid the pit traps, but knowing me, I'll hit one. The only
maps to HS we have show them going to a lower level. Where you land
depends on which trap you fall into. There seems to be an exit in the
center of the lower level. Where does that take you? Back to the
zone-in, or out to the OT? Any mobs down on that lower level?

I know..... too many questions. Shut up stupid troll. ;-)
