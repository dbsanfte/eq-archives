Ok He is having the same argument with himself that we are having here.

Basically haste percentage can be described 2 ways :

The percentage decrease in delay
The percentage increase in swings per min

The second is what Xaas confusingly calls "Damage increase"
Xaas is trying to get everyone to use the same figure for haste.

Example my new haste item "Gloves of Nifftyness" has the following
effect :

Not wearing it my 10/20 1HS swings 30 in a minute.
Wearing my Gloves it swings 40 times in a minute.

So it has 33% haste right ? (40 - 30 ) / 30 ?
Or does it have 25% haste ? (40 - 30 ) / 40 ?

Or look at the new Delay (40 / 60) * 10 = 15
So the haste is (20 - 15) / 20 = 25%

Both are right.

Decrease in delay = 25%
Increase in swings = 33%

Make sure that you know what people are quoting to you when you ask
aabout the haste of an item.

Xaas' article is confusing because he reffers to "Increase in number of
swings" as "Damage Increase". In the end what he means is that people
tend to quote the higher of the two (valid) haste percentages. So always
expect a quoted value to be the increase in the number of swings not the
decrease in delay.

He is of course wrong, haste does reduce the delay of the weapon. That
just is not the figure that is quoted for the "haste" of many items /
spells.

HTH,

Jim
