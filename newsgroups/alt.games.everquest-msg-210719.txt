Greetings all,
Level 51 Bard here.  I'm curious to find out what you all think my
magic/cold/fire/disease/poison resistances should be at my level.  I
will provide a breakdown of what my resistances are at currently...

Magic 88
Poison 50ish (can't remember exact number)
Disease 50ish (can't remember exact number)
Cold 90
Fire 96

Is this too low for un-buffed resistances at my level?  I know ideally
all of my resistances would be at 200 but I'm really looking for a
general idea of what I should probably have or what the average is.
