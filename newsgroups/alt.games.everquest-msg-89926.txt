If you are gonna walk thru paludal caverns by yourself, you are crazy.  You
won't make it.  I had trouble at 26, had to fight most of the way and that
durn 'spreading crud' never goes away.  Going thru there most of the way can
be done on the walls, go up the wall as far as you can get and just walk
right past, ditch your pet first, more trouble then worth if all you wanna
do is go thru.  You can't do the whole cavern like that but it does avoid
alot of the fighting so you can survive the ones you can't avoid.  Good
luck, happy hunting
