Keep in mind that EQ2 will not run with all bells & whistles turned on for 
those with even bleeding edge PCs right now.

With a P4 2.4 with 768MB PC2100 RAM and a Radeon 9700 128MB video card (in 
other words, not a bad system but obviously not the best) with in-game 
Performance set at "Balanced" (neither great quality nor great performance) 
I still lag in any non-instanced zone (towns).  In the big zones (S & N 
Qeynos for instance) the lag can be quite bad.  Think POK on your computer 
now.
