I was the victim of some anti-soloing sentiment this morning.  The other 
character would not listen as I think he has been reamed by farmers from 
some of his comments.  I have found that soloers typically fall into three 
categories:

1) LFG soloers.  People have the time to play in groups but none are 
available.

2) Time-constrained soloers (of which I am one).  People who have at most 
an hour or two a day (if they are lucky) due to RL that enjoy the game and 
the social aspects (though they are admittedly limited for the soloer).  
They may or may not group depending on the the time they have to play.

3) People out to get the best and "beat" the game and view soloing as the 
fastest way to get there.

While I have no problems with the first or second type of soloer, I do with 
the third when he/she "hogs" camp sites and farms them for extended periods 
of time or in the busy part of the day.

Personally, I enjoy the more casual social aspects of soloing during the 
limited times I get to play.  I understand that Verant would rather we 
group, but I also think they'd like my (and many others) payment every 
month too.

What are your thoughts?  Thanks for letting me vent.
