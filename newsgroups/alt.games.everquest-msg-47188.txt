Yep. I gave up playing my mage there when I realized what a pain it was going
to be. You can't buy level appropriate spells without hours and hours spent
killing stuff that pays only a few silvers at best.  That, combined with the
character wipe next Monday. . .  Well, it just wasn't worth the effort IMO.
Guess it's not so bad if you are a melee class (they did bump skills of all
kinds to an appropriate level), but not very helpful if you are a caster. Too
bad they didn't buff bank accounts (or spellbooks) a bit while they were at
it.  /shrug  Anyway, it was fun while it lasted and I probably will make a
character to play on FV when it goes live.
