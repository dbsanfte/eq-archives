For what it is worth : I hunted the Warrens with my Vah Shir
Beastlord, and the Captured Kerran was scowling at me. Further on, the
Kerrans on the Erudin Ocean island are indifferent to me.

It might be totally insignifficant, but if Kerrans and Vah Shir are
connected faction-wise, wouldnt they be more - well - warmly towards
each other ?

Good Hunting all,
