Heck, I have a 54 Druid & Still get hives thinking about SolB... it's
not exactly a Druid friendly zone... too many twisty tunnels, no room
to kite, basically, unless the Druid is in group, it's a big coffin.
Again, good dungeon for the reasons you listed, but NOT good fro a
druid... 

Try Rathe, or maybe Solo Giants in FM. They drop nice things :) Or go
hit lizards in Feerott... they also drop FS.
