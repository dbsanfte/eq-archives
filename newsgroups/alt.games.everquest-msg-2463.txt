Ok now you snipped out the first part of that sentence, I also
mentioned....

"I am terrible at gauging prices and much prefer to hunt rather than
buy,...."

That makes it so much clearer why my price would be so silly, as in I
really have no clue, hehe.  I really don't deal on auctions much at all,
if I need to go to market I tend to use an agent who does that sort of
thing for me as I have no clue on what stuff is worth.  He on the other
hand has an odd habit of pulling off fantastic deals so when I find a
nice item I tend to give it to him to take to market.  If he gets a
great deal on something he knows I might like he lets me know, its a
nice system for someone like me who has no clue and no real desire to
memorize stats and prices on a few thousand items.
