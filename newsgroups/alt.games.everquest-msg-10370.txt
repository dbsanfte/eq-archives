From what I know of adsl (supplied by BT) they don't like you sharing it's
bandwidth on a LAN, it is for one PC only...At least that's what I have
heard, whereas the cable telco's (NTL and Telewest) have no such problems
and will even give you advice on how to do it, not sure if this has changed
BT's policy, prolly not.
(cable, in the UK, is the same bandwidth as ADSL 512/256)

I have little experience with ADSL in practice but you wouldn't require
another ADSL "modem" you just need a router (which could actually be your PC
with a second network card and internet sharing) and run the other PC(s) on
a LAN. ADSL is a permanent connection rather than a dial up so all PCs would
stay connected while they were on the network.

Another, EQ related, problem you will find is that you cannot move
characters to another account, so someone will have to start again.
