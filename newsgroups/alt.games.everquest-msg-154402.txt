Nope.  He has a lot of other single items too, and they are universally
overpriced by at factor of 2-10.

I noticed that he hasn't sold a single spider silk in several days,
though, so I think so far his strategy isn't working very well.  Maybe his 
merchant is just a facade for a gambling place in the back room... he is a
troll and so has a rather large large back room :P
