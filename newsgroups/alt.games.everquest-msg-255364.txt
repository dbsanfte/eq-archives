I don't know ... maybe I'm too far outside the norm.  I'm not looking to
match my gear up against anyone else's, or to say I've been to a certain
zone that you can only get to by unlocking the holiest of holies.

All I'm looking for is a viable, entertaining career path for a character
that, up to now at least, I've enjoyed playing a certain way.  The ranger is
soloing the entrance to the Hole now with nothing but whatever food and
drink can be foraged, a bow, two weps, and a fletching kit.  And, near as I
can tell from the research I've done, when that dries up it's pretty much
over.  The next level of mob hits too hard for a chain class to stand up
against, no matter what I may purchase in the bazaar.

So this is terminal, so it would seem, for this character's advancement.
Maybe 55 levels, and it's time to change careers.

The unfair part I'm actually roleplaying in a roleplaying game that doesn't
see too much roleplaying these days.  I will have to stop because I chose to
roleplay in some other way than the intended way.

Again, I can only speak for myself.  I have no desire to get in a dick
waving contest over gear ... I could really care less.  I just want the
character to stay alive and viable in the way I've elected to play. I pay my
money every month as well as the next guy.

See above comment.  Again, maybe I'm not the norm ... maybe there's more of
the sentiment you describe out there than I realize.  But all I'm looking
for is to keep my niche.  I have nothing at all against grouping, but if I
want to group I go for the cleric or the SK.

It doesn't matter to me if I have to bust my hump to get somewhere, or to
earn my next bow, or what have you.  I enjoyed the Trueshot Longbow quest,
even though the bow I had was already better than the Trueshot.  I enjoyed
the Short Sword of Morin quest, and still have the sword, because it was a
ranger only quest and I did it myself using my own SoW and my own tracking,
etc., etc..

But, sadly, those days seem to drawing to a close.
