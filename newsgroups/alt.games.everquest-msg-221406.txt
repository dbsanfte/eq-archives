Agreed.

Or afraid that anybody would notice that the population had in fact 
dropped...

It was also a server that old characters on old servers couldn't 
transfer too, iirc.

It *should* also have been restricted to characters whose accounts were 
activated after it went live... but its far too late for that.

I ran into Whosyerdaddie a 23rd level druid today. The filters arent
