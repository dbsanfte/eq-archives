	Nah.  I parsed it more as "MOBs will be less likely to attack
characters who have Shieldskin/Divine Aura/etc up."

	Which, if you think about it, plays right into the hands of
maintaining aggro on high-level MOBs.  Have everybody that can cast
Shieldskin or Divine Aura on themselves do so right before the fight.
MOB says "Hah!  I will not be phewled by your clever skeems!  I will
attack this unshielded-but-heavily-armored Warrior in front of me!"

	AB
