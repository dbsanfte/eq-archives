Dex is more easilly buffed than Stamina though.  Using standard level 65 
shaman buff lineup, dex will be boosted by 105, stamina by 60.  For DPS 
types, toss on FA as well, for an additional 140 dex, (as well as ATK 
which is the real reason for the buff).  You can go with alternate buff 
lineups from a shaman to boost sta by 105 and dex by 150, then add 
another 140 for FA, at the expense of some hp usually, as well as more 
buff slots.
