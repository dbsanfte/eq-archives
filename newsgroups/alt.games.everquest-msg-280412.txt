Clerics get Yaulp,gives 12 mana standing,just 6 less than medding.
I am absolutely sure I do more damage meleeing/yaulping than
with medding/nuking due to resists when fighting non-undead mobs.
Especially true when doing MPG with all those high level mobs,which
love to resist nukes.
I have yet to see a resisted proc from the summoned hammer.
