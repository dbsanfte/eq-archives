There seems to be alot of that lately.

I was in a Sarnak fort group & a looting "issue" came up. I got disgusted &
dropped from the group. Next thing I know 1 of my guildmates was sending me
a tell saying that someone from this group filed a complaint with my guild
about my poor "sportsmanship" and also proceeded to  shout across the zone
advising noone to group with me since I was a trouble maker.

I set my guild right, did an /ooc to this character advising him that I left
the group cause I felt that the situation was not resolvable & it did not
suit me to play with a group that felt casters didn't need loot, and I
proceeded to port to Karanas to play in Paw.

My guildmate sent me another tell telling me that she was going to advise
our council to remove me from guild. She said they didn't need troublemakers
in our guild.  Fortunately, she is not an officer. But I am.

Nothing ended up happening, but I have advised my guild leader that I am
considering leaving. I go to Norrath to enjoy myself - not play power games
with anal retentive children.
