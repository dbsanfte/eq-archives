Lots of things you could try

For the ae- war cry, bard resists, potions.  Theres no real way to avoid it,
certainly not for the rotation, ma and melee dps
Hybrid tank with fearless (100% fear immunity)

2 seperate rotations (completly seperate) on the same MA

Pure spam heals. More resilience against the fear, but way more mana and
agro intensive

CoD pets

Position him correctly before the trigger dies (pops in the same spot)

He is a real monster compared to the other 2, and when learning the
encounter it does have an element of luck attached to it (if you'd call
resist rates "luck") but he is totally killable, think we used 40 on our
first kills, way back whenever.

If you go with the CoD approach.. have a team assigned to preparing pets in
the room prior to RD. Pull / snare / tash / sinia so they are ready to be
charmed when existing pets die

He rampages, and it really hurts.

Hth for starters
