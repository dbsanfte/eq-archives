Hmm, Christmas sounds more interesting at your house than at mine....I trust
you heard about the dyslexic devil-worshiper who sold his soul to Santa?

What you do with the router is figure out how to configure the router for
PPPoE, and it takes the DSL-service password and just logs on to the service
automatically. Took me some time and fiddling to make that happen, but once
I did, it's 98.99% reliable. Been ages since I had any EQ lag worth
mentioning.

I have SBCYahoo DSL, and it will for no apparent reason make my home router
unhappy once in a while. We're talking one day every other month or
something. What's frustrating is that the ISP officially doesn't support
routers other than the overpriced ones they want to sell you themselves, so
they forbid their tech-support people from helping me solve the problem. I
have to convince them that a problem is the DSL service itself not working
altogether, or else just solve the router problem without support.
