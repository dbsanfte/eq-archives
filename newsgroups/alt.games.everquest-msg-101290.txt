Hmmm. We have a much much much better national transit system I think, by virtue
of having a much much much smaller landmass.

I'm not talking about localised city systems like "subways" (tubes here ;-) ) or
busses or trams (trolleys? there), but... well, put it this way.

I live on the outskirts of london , 15 minute walk to the tube
station, 45 minute journey into the center to work, thats it. I
read on the tube, or sometimes sleep if I've had a late night
(amazing, my body knows the journy so well I actually *do* wake up
at my station ;-) ) so its only 15 minutes "dead" time and half of
that is walking through a nice park with birds twittering and stuff,
so I dont really mind.

Now, some of my friends live a much longer way away, but they drive
to the nearest mainline rail station and catch that in - their
commute takes 30 minutes total, the main line rail system comes
right into the center of the city at many points and covers pretty
much the entire country.

Its actually in a piss poor state of affairs since the government
before this one tried to privatise it, and competition on a single
infrastructure isnt working very well, but it IS comprehensive, and
it has worked pretty well prior to seperating out the operating
companies from the track owners and giving them different economic
motivators with limited tenders so they dont want to invest cause
in 7 years its not theirs any more.

But thats another story; shrot answer.... even the "far away"
commutes are quick here by comparison because the rail network is
a tighter web. When it works.

Sui ;-) (So, uh, this EQ thing. What is it again?)
