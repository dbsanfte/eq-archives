I used to look for a suitable caster who was medding between fights or
whatever and offer payment upfront, moving on if ignored (most people
had no problem, nobody ever bitched, any who were offended must've
been among those few who did not respond).  I don't do this anymore,
mostly because with the Nexus and PoK you now have two transit points
where you can /ooc for buffs and get where you want to be soon after.
Pre-Luclin I would've argued with you about this (and did argue with
some folks, heh), but with the transit points (especially PoK) they've
got in-game now you're 100% correct.
