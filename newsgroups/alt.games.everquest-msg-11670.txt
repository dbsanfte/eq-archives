Since my main is a melee class, I had adjusted all my text colors to be 
readable in full screen view. Nice light colors to show up on dark 
backgrounds. Then I start playing my druid and can't read a darn thing when 
medding. So, I adjust the colors to work on a light tan background. Next 
time 
I go in, can't read a darn thing in full screen mode. Argh! My solution is 
going to be to make my full screen text box background light tan and be done 
with it.

You do see WAY more of what's going on in full screen mode. And, more 
importantly you get 10 hotkeys instead of 6. I'll fiddle with colors for 
that 
convenience! :-)
