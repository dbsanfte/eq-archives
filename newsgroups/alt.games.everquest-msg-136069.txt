Should I even point out again that that was not, in fact, what he said?

He didn't -say- it was OK to victimize people with such a mentality, he 
said rather that they are more likely to end up being victims.  Or 
portraying themsleves as victims in problems they brought on themslves.

}Why go after my wife and children???

victimizing you.
