Hm, that does sound like it might have been related to multiples of
the same aura.  That could easily be the sort of thing that the client
might decide was unexpected and worth writing to the debug log.

I was running around with a cleric/druid pair last night, and between the
druid's pet bear and the cleric's pet hammer, I was getting a lot of "aura
of X spell has worn off" messages.  I do like having the auras work for the
pets, and am probably willing to tolerate the clutter in the chat window
where I have spell-related stuff, but I'll keep in mind the option of
blocking the auras if it gets bad.

As it was, I did have to add a new audio trigger.  I already have one for
"spell has worn off", so that I'll notice when buffs wear off (not just for
my pet).  (It also lets me know when DOTs or Fear spells wear off, for
instance.)  But having it keep prodding me as the pet wandered in and out
of aura range was too much, so I added a trigger for "Your pet's Aura" that
plays an empty sound file, and put it higher in my list than "spell has
worn off".
