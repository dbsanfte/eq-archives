I had a low level Enchanter come up to me in West Freeport and offer
to do a magic trick for a gold.  I said OK, and he cast minor
illusion.  I gave him the gold, and /cheer'ed.  If I'd had anything
good on my that I had planned to sell, I think I would have given it
to me, for begging in an amusing in-character way like that.
