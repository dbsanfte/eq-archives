I love how people take one situation (PoK books) and blow it up into 
something completely ludicrous and say "See! this proves my point!"

All you have to do is not use the books and just like the old days 
look for a Wizzy/Druid port and pay the plat for the taxi.  That may 
not be as fast as the books, but it is not the huge amount of time you 
all say will leave you crippled with nothing to do but cry for the 
good old days.
