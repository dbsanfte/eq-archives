How many variations of Drizzt have *you* seen?  And how many of
Muad'dib, or of Conan, or Merlin, or ....

I've seen someone wandering around on Xegony who's name is exactly the
same as one of our senior guild members, differing only by a single
character.  And no, it wasn't a twink of said guild member; I asked.

Take your average age 16 mentality, let it pick a Station name, and
I'll bet you'll find a lot of similar station names.  Then they pick a
password, which will quite often be related to the Station name they
chose.  Yes, the odds are low on hitting name / password on the first
try, but I'll bet they aren't nearly as low as you think they are, IF
you select from certain categories.

I wonder what would happen if I were, say, to type in Station Name
Pokemon and Password Pikachu?  I'm using these as completely
unsupported guesses, but I'd not be surprised at all if I got into
someone's account using them.  Now, start running variations on those
two, or simply start using other little monstrosities' names, and you
can see how you can actually get much better odds than you might at
first think.
