 They are reliant on both Monk factions in Qeynos and Freeport. You can
either mindlessly kill greenies for hours trying to build faction or you
can just have a mule do the headbands/sashes since they are not No Drop.

 I haven't seen much disadvantage of being an Iksar. Depsite all the
ones that are listed they didn't really bother me all that much. On
Kunark Iksar really have the best faction of all since it's possible to
become non-kos in all three cities much easier than it is for others to
become non-kos in Cabilis.

 Never parsed it, really. If you want to be a pure damage dealer you'd
probably want to start a rogue.

 Same as above. Reuse time is about 6-9 seconds possibly. Never really
timed that either.

 Depends. Assuming you can actually get a successful feign off... On a
lot of the upper level mobs if you 'successfully' feign they'll keep
beating on you. I don't think it actually decreases you on the hate
list. It just allows time for someone else to get higher. Whereas when a
rogue successfully evades it reduces them a set amount.

 They can normally attack since the main tank should have build up some
aggro. However, if using fast weapons the monk will normally draw aggro
on himself. This is why you should also carry a nice 2hb (Imbued
Fighters Staff is good) with you and switch as the case may be. 


>6.) How requested are Monks in high level groups? Are they generally useful

 For the general 'perfect group' that people try to come up with Monks
aren't normally included. If you want a class just because it will be
'useful' and needed a lot, monk probably isn't the one you should go
for. However, if you enjoy playing a monk then there you go. Play what
you will find fun not what you think will be needed at the higher
levels. All classes have a place in groups.

 If you were interested in my references - I have a 60 Iksar monk.
