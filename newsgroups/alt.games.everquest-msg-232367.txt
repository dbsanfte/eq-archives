As far as end game, or dungeons druids can hold their own. I have
never had a problem in dungeons except where a tank is not able to
hold aggro. Dungeons are very dependand actually on the make up of the
WHOLE group, and how they are played more than anything. I have a 96%
success rate 61-3, and some of those are in Hard adventures. I have no
problem as main healer in Normal Adventures. Although I prefer a
mezzer, I have done a few without - but the group has to be very sharp
(usually a pally helps).

I have Shrew (indoor sow + ultravision), indoor group/self wolf-form,
and my root never breaks mez (-0- damage root, and I always snare em
too). With the AA's tossed in (I have 52 at the moment), it makes life
easier too. Having Spirit of the Wood x3 (group regen/ds), and exodus
has saved my group's neck a few times.
