There is only 1 thing that druids can do better than any other class with
Luclin...  Cold and Fire reist buffs.  We have the top of the line buff now
for these 2 areas -- + 55 to both with 1 spell, for the group(s).

Beynod that, bards get the group running faster than we can.  Healing...
forget it, we know who is better.  Damage shield?  ask a magician.
Nukes  -- to many options.  DOTs, again...  we come in real close with a
shaman but don't have haste nor slow.  On down the line...  The only thing
we do best is with those 2 buff areas -but- we do it all.  As was pointed
out before, there are enough of the crap druids out there that don't know
how to work their char differently that it kind of messes with those that do
know how to work them.
