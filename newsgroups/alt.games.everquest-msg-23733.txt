The first quest involves getting 4 ghast hearts. Nightly spawn in
LFay, rare drop. Second quest involves killing a couple dark elves in
LFay and bringing in their heads and some other things. I have lost
the quest descriptions and can't really recall the third, but it
involves some drop from MM.
I am high enough level to do all three, but until I get cable or DSL
and don't have to pay per minute, my time is better spent doing other
stuff than even just getting the first necklace. Once I get that, I'll
probably get around to doing the first and second, but I am not really
motivated to do the third. I have a more reliable root memmed almost
all the time anyway, and I would get a better wis necklace if I'd farm
Runnyeye.

I've promised a rogue friend to get to 190+ brewing - he said he'll
need that for his future coldain rings. Current skill is 150, and what
I make doesn't disappear if you look away for 30 minutes.
