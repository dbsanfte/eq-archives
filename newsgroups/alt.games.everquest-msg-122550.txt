    I'm down to just needing the robe, which I can buy from someone my guild
knows for 4 K. Now THAT is a nice enterprise - assuming he can get silk
swatches, and can imbue emeralds, he can skill up on the Robe combines from
skill 160 all the way to 250 and still make money. Each combine takes about
50 pp of materials and three silk swatches, huntable almost anywhere, making
this the cheapest and easiest way to raise Tailoring past 158. He also has,
at skill 160, the minimum 3% chance of success on any combine. So his cost
per robe is, on average, (100/3)x50pp or roughly 1600 pp. I just wish I had
the time to do the same....

    But I digress. Person selling Idols on my server was selling for 3 K. I
was impatient, decided I wanted it rather than wait for my soon-to-be
harried guildmate to log on (it was an earring frenzy last night). I offered
her 9 Divine Crystalline Glazes (she usually buys those for 200 each), a
Lucky Cabbage, and two of the twines needed for the fishing rod (after the
combine with Dragon Egg Oil). Yay me on new idol! In general, a tradeskiller
will value tradeskill supplies a lot more than you might expect because it
lets them make more cash as opposed to wasting time hunting for stuff.
