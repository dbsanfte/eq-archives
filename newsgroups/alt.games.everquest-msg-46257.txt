Another important bit of data to back up Lucian's comments is that Anthrax,
unlike Small Pox, is not contagious. It is required to be directly applied.
Therefore, Anthrax is even that much less of a threat and Lucian's warnings
are something to take into consideration. Also consider it is extremely
difficult to properly deploy. It has happened before. And it can happen
again. So take it all into consideration.
