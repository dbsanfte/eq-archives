We druids get the shaft on class specific quests...

But you could do the "Beguile plants" spell scroll quest in FV
Or the Handy Shillelagh in FV

BTW, you don't have to pay to look up most stuff like quests or items on
Allakhazam's, just the extended item seach parameters and (the one think I
would pay for, because I want it) items by zone.
