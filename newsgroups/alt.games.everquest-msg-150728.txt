I know there are some rarer spawns that have PHs or are triggered and don't
show but, for a non triggered random spawn with no PH as a Monk I would have
to say Raster is rated pretty high. I know there are some spawns that are
very rare that are triggered if rare certain mobs are killed at the right
time or a rare PH is killed they have a chance of spawning. I have seen
Raster pop without a mob being killed and there is no standing PH for
Raster.
