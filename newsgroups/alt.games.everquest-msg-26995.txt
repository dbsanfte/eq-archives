This has now turned into such great fun that, while definitely a guilty pleasure, I
must push on. :-)

If we make the assumption that your base argument is valid, then yes, it's very
relevant. It's also completely wrong, but very relevant. :-p

My apologies if you found the clinton comparison offensive. It was intended as
humor. But I think the analogy very apt. You are attempting to stretch, distort,
and in some cases nullify the definition of some pretty clear cut words to suit
your position.

Not in the least.  Every argument that you've posted to support your position has
said (to me, at least) that you don't believe that there *is* a definition for
misspelling, or for correct spelling for that matter. I'm curious, do you *really*
not see that, or are you intentionally ignoring it to try to defend a very shaky
position? Taking your very own arguments, then your name that you post under is
not, in fact, "Dan Day". It's simply a transposition of "Day Dan". (A "spoonerism"
I believe, since the previous definition given only said that spoonerisms
transposed sounds <usually> in the first syllable.) It's also an anagram of
"Nadday".  What's your *real* name, Nadday? See my point?
  The key issue that you are missing (or ignoring, I'm not sure which) is *INTENT*.
What was the writer of any given word, phrase, name, etc. *intending* to convey
with what he/she wrote. And since we're dealing with EQ names which don't have to
be "real' words at all, then every single name, word, and/or collection of letters
imaginable is an anagram, spoonerism, or misspelling of something else. You simply
can't hide behind that defense.
  The actual subject at hand (and yes, I will annoyingly keep dragging this back to
the specific case you are defending) is Tigole Bitties. We've all agreed already
that either the first or surname alone is not reflective of anything, and while
confusing, would pass the rules and be fine. However, in context, as a full name,
I'll try asking you one more time. What do *you* think the writer was trying to
convey when that name was assembled? You are the one who, in another post in this
thread, invoked "the man on the street".  Will you really step up to the plate here
and say that this hypothetical man on the street would interpret that name as
anything other than "Big Ole' Titties"?  I think not.
  That being the case, then we have a person taking a name which is in violation of
the naming policy (anatomical references, refer to previous posts for source) and
they have changed the spelling of both the first and last words. By doing so, both
of those words are now *misspelled* in terms of the *INTENT* of what the original
phrase was *intended* to spell.  Might this *also* be called a "spoonerism"? Sure,
if you like.  But does it change the fact that the two words of the intended phrase
are now spelled incorrectly? No. Intent is the key here, Dan, and all the wordplay
and dancing around the issues in the world won't change that.

I do disagree with you, as I have stated, and sorry, but yes, I view it as you
twisting the stated rules around to try to dodge them in this scenario. It's an
intentional misspelling of a banned, offensive anatomical reference. Very clearly
spelled out in the naming policy.  I honestly can't see how any defense of the name
stands up beyond that.

But that's *exactly* what you're trying to do. You do it by trying to deny the
existence of misspelled words!  By your rationale, nothing is ever misspelled or
spelled correctly, and that's simply insane.

Yes, yes, yes...... and in the real world, courts sadly have to deal with people
finding loopholes all the time and "revise the rules to cover such cases". (Read
here: "cover every imaginable loophole that will ever be thought of by con artists
trying to dodge the intent of the rules via technicalities and loopholes.")
However, the rules in this case are clear enough for anybody not trying to
intentionally dodge them, and the judgment doesn't have to pass a battery of OJ
Simpson lawyers to stand, fortunately.

They aren't misspelled because they aren't words, proper, slang, obscene, or
otherwise. They are made up collections of letters with no *intent* behind them
other than to serve as the abstract name of a character. Again, you try to dodge
the core issue, and again I foil your attempts. AHA!  :-p

Unlike the phrase "big ole' titties", those are single words that I'd have to see
in context to know the *INTENT* of the writer. (No, I'm not going to stop saying
that, so don't bother asking.) If they were pulled from a sentence that said, "Jane
sighed in happiness, snuggled in her boyfriend's arms, as they stared together up
at the beautiful, twinkling North Rats in the night sky." then I'd say, yes. It's a
misspelling. The fact that it's also an anagram has nothing to do with the *intent*
of the author, or the fact that the word "Star" was misspelled in that sentence.

> How about "arts"? "Tsar"?

Anagrams. Put them in context to show me the *intent* of the author using them, and
I'll try to help you sort out whether or not they're misspelled.

Bravely attempting to drag this conversation back on topic, I'm going to make the
awful error of "assuming" you're talking about an EQ name. If it's a first name
with no surname, then it's just a fantasy based name the person chose for their
character. It's inoffensive in nature, not suggestive of anything, and violates no
rules. Now if you put it in context where the surname is Asz, for instance, then
I'll say it's a deliberate misspelling of "Rat's Ass", and it's now in violation.
If the complete name turns out to be "Srat Windwalker", then it's fine.  Does this
clear up your confusion for you yet? I'm really trying to help.

> Hmm, is it the "gray area"?

Not in the least. See above.

I don't' know. I'm sure you have at one point or other, but since I'm too lazy to
go back and look, let's give you the benefit of the doubt and say you didn't'. So
we agree the *intent* was to say "Bigole Titties".......... why are we continuing
this debate again, then?

No. I'm trying very hard to get you to acknowledge that there *are* such things as
misspelled words, and they can be easily identified when the *intent* of the author
is either known or obvious.  And we've already agreed on the intent of the author
in this case.

> Is a character named "Buck" a misspelling of "Fuck"?  Or is it
> in the "close but not quite" category?

See above. What's the last name? If it's "Yufuddy", then it's a deliberate
misspelling of "Fuck You Buddy", and a violation. If it's "Rogers", it's another
type of violation. If there is no surname, or the last name is "Windwalker", then
it's fine. Clear yet?

And you've already accepted that Tigole Bitties is also, we just haven't got you to
stop saying "spoonerism" and start also saying "misspelling" yet.

Your "book" is seriously flawed, then, since you agree the author *intended* to
form the message "Big Ole' Titties".  You should get a new book.

This is the part where you really drift off into fantasy land. You are the one
denying the existence of misspellings, preferring to treat them all as spoonerisms,
anagrams, or gawds only know what else in an effort to twist the rules. Both
"watermelon" and "lemon" are spelled correctly above, until you put them in context
and are able to divine the *intent* of the author. I could make more examples for
each, but by now I hope you're starting to get the point.

> Your mileage may differ, but I believe I still have a valid point.

Apparently my mileage differs vastly, but then again, I drive an SUV.
