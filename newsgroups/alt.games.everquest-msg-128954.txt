Your heart's in the right place.  The Revolutionary War was fought
with standard european battlefield tactics.  However, there was little
protection for non-belligerants and non-combatants by either side.
The first American to die in the war, reputedly, was Crispus Attucks -
a former slave.  Many British, and more precisely, Tories were run out
of town or killed outright.  Same as for rebellious colonists at the
hands of the British Army.

Battles are often fought at or near the site of cities.  Not because
of the cities themselves, but because the cities usually are located
at the most desirable place for control of riverways, hilltops and
natural roads.

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
