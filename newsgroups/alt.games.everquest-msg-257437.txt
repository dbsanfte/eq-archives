Hot Zone status just means they have temporarily increased the ZEM, so 
every kill you do there gives you more experience than it used to for 
the same effort.

The level ranges you see are SOE's idea of the level range of characters 
that "should" be exping in that zone.  Often there are mobs in a given 
zone that can be exped on at well outside that level range... and even 
if they had it completely right, that a given zone would normally be 
useful only in that level range, this still leaves several discrepencies;

If I can solo well on a mob at level, its hard to believe a full group 
more couldn't handle the same mob at more than 5 levels lower than me.

If a warrior can solo well on a mob at a given level, its hard to 
believe a shaman can't solo well on the same mob at more than 5 levels 
lower.

Whats most interesting about their posted level range, though, is that a 
majority of EQ players are sheep, and can be herded; this means that the 
Hot Zones tend to have players in them in the level range they post, 
which means that if you are around that level range, you can find pickup 
groups there a lot easier, if you enjoy that sort of thing.  I 
personally -do- enjoy pickup groups with the random grab bag of 
experienced players and EBayers and outlandish twinks and people still 
in newbie armor.

To me, the Hot Zone concept is a good one because it concentrates the 
limited resource of people in my level range into areas where I can 
reliably find a partner or scale all the way up to a full group.  So 
far, I've also been able to solo in the Hot Zone's I've picked, which 
means never not being able to play, which is something I despise; 
sitting and waiting LFG.

Funny thing, though, I was able to do Gunthak steadily from around 28 
thru around 45, and in fact at 51 there are still lots of DB mobs in 
there, I just need a partner or two because they are a mix of casters 
and not something I can solo efficiently.  ZEM just dropped on that 
endeavor, though, and I'll probably let that, and the likelyhood that 
the partner population just plummeted there, chase me out and after the 
next promised land.
