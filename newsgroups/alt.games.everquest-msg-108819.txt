No, Verant basically took the format of a basic mud and put graphics
to it.  Why should they get credit for that?  They weren't even the
first to do it.  They borrowed much from others more than they
created.  Most of their original content (graphics) won't be reused
anyway.  Verant has done nothing revolutionary except charge people
for the experience.
