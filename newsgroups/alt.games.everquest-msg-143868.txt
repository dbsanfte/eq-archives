You are the first person in a long time I have heard associate
socialism with fascism/communism.  For me, socialism is associated
with the industrialized democracies, especially in Europe, but most
definitely including the U.S.  What I see is that in a regulated
capitlist economy, under a representative democracy, an assortment
of socialist policies and programs are part of what keeps the
standard of living high, and not incidentally the level of political
unrest low.  The most successful of these societies seem to be those
who are constantly wrangling about policies in general and programs
in particular, changing policies and programs from time to time, as
we do in the U.S.

It's a tax.  The fact that its revenues are directed to fund a
specific program doesn't make it less of a tax.  The government
has the same right to collect social security tax as it does income
tax or any other tax.  It's probably be loads cheaper to get rid of
the whole bothersome mess and fund it out of general revenues, but
then they'd have to add another welfare program for all the
displaced bureaucrats.  :-p

During the Depression, when the nearly unregulated banking and
stock market sectors of the economy tanked and took most everybody
else down with them.  The private charities couldn't cope.  And
even before the Depression things were pretty damned horrible for
lots of young families when Dad got laid off, or injured, or
killed.  I don't know about you, but I think it's a very good idea
that the governemnt work to avoid malnourished/deformed/diseased
children begging in the streets because their parents are not given
the opportunity feed and care for them.

Better to fully agree, the biggest problem with our current
welfare system is that it has become institutionalised, allowing
some folks to make a "carrer" out of being on welfare.  That is
just stupid.  Stupidest thing was they insistence on treating
welfare recipients "with dignity".  People <should> be embarrased
to be on the dole, that will motivate a lot of them to get the
hell off it just as fast as they can.  Then it'd become once again
a "safety net" to catch people as they fall, instead of being an
alternate to leading a productive life as a contributor to society.
It used to be that the overwhelming majority of folks who signed
up for AFDC were off it in less than two years (most common cause
was financial disaster resulting from unexpected injury, illness,
or death in a family).  I doubt that's true anymore.  So, change
the rules, pull the rug out from under the scammers and the bums,
and stop trying to tell people that it's ok to feel good about
being on the dole.
