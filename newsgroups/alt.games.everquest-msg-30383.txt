bah! bluebies!  PvP is the most fun aspect of EQ!  When I play on VZ on my
main and someone is pissing me off, I annihilate them.  It's that simple.

Also, there is nothing like making a darkie with my friends and raiding EC
and Freeport.

I don't know if i would have fun in EQ without PvP.  It actually gives a
sense of danger and difficulty, unlike the bluebie servers.  Goes to show
you...people made characters on SZ and couldnt take it...so they went back
to their bluebie servers.

The real EQ players are on PvP servers

thats my 2cp
