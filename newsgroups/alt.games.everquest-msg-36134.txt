The code is the same for the research skill.  What is different is the
cap.  For most skills, the cap is 5*(level+1) or 4*(level+1) or
3*(level+1).  Note that these caps are higher than level.  For
research, the cap is 5*(level-15).  That gives this:

Level	Research Cap
 16	   5
 17	  10
 18	  15
 19	  20
 20	  25

So, if you put a point into research at level 16, your skill is set to
16, which is above the cap.  Since it is above the cap, you can't put
any more points in.  Not until you reach 19 will you be able to raise
the research skill again.
