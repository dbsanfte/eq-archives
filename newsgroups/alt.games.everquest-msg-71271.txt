	Actually, my main complaints with downtime have been too much downtime not
related to adventuring -- too much time wasted trying to get from point A to
point B, too much time spent by fighters trying to get bound (no, other PCs
are NOT usually happy to help out, even for pay), too much time spent LFG at
a_dungeon00's zone line waiting until the right classes are available to make
a group.  As for soloing, I always thought soloing a Ranger, pre-Panic, should
have been the benchmark for solo activity: possible, but risky and slow.  Most
casters, and post-Panic Rangers, can solo far too easily.
