We did this the other night - there was a level 65 character farming and we
were getting peeved off with not getting any pulls (for xp).
In the end we went up to the top of the hill and started to kill the giant
skellies and to our amazement (and his disappointment) there were giants and
cyclops galore!

He wasn't very happy with us killing a few and tried to train us a couple of
times, but it just gave us more xp and loot.  It would have been so much
easier for him to share =)
