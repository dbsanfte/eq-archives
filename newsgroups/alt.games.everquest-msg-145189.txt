This line works very well on snow griffins.  They are ranger
mobs, and cast (like most rangers) half a dozen buffs on
themselves.  Sadly, they are clever enough that they bury SOW
down deep, fifth or sixth buff down.  So you have to strip
off more than even an annul worth to get the SOW.

On the other hand, you'll find that without their DS
and other ranger buffs, they are much easier to kill
if its melee you have in mind.
