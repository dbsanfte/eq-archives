Totally totally worthless, I would be happy to have two things change,
(1) zero level PVP, with guards enforcing no fighting in cities. You
attack a player the guards come and kill you. (2) Eliminate zonewides,
/AUC /OOC /SHOUT it is just worthless. People crying "KSing is wrong",
"training is bad", and my favorite, "10pp for someone to PL me to 6".
This is HARDCORE, and you gonna die. I hacve heard nothing on zonewide
worth the cost of displaying it obn my screen.

That was part of the fun, but I died a few times, I need to farm up
some bonechips when I get to the right level. Boat rides is another, I
had to ride the boat to Freeport, and it was a problem with the 1017s.
I live, but I missed the FP dock.

Part of the fun is playing on that. A 13yo can own you, but, if you
play it right he can own himself pretty fast.

You got a icemaker too? Hmmmm!

I love it. Don't want a PoK though. I can do without the PVP but the
EQ basic stuff is nice. Boats again, etc. If PVP stays it needs to be
zero level. Basically, the 20plus crowd is able to pick off 6th level
people at will.

They could do that at 1st level, perhaps the PVP range needs to be
closer in. Some guy dinging 6th level gets whacked fast. Right now it
is tilted to pet classes, since you can utterly wipe a 6th level
player from a long ways off with your pet.

When I get Selo's I will see what I can do, until then I remain a
BIGJERK!
