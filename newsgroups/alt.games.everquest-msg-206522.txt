The random generator of EQ is very out of whack, but there is no hardcoded
stuff for loottables in consideration to levels. Only Firiona Vie has that,
and that's only for magic tagged loot.

I think it's a matter of perception. When you were lower you hunted them for
exp for hours upon hours, leaving you with like 4 stacks after 2 days of
exping.

Now you kill them by the dozens but 1 hour of farming almost feels like 2
days of exping (to me at least). If you still only have 2 stacks after say
an hour, which is way more then you used to have in that time period, you
just get the feeling they're not dropping as often.
