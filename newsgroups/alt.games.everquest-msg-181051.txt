What I always find funny:

You ask around in the Bazaar for a pricecheck on a certain item. There are
always people that will totally underprice it (greed?) and say they have
sold it for half of what I wanted to sell it for..... I used pricecheck
however to see if I could buy one and not sell one. In this case I wanted a
certain helmet and he said it was only 700p and he was looking as well. No
way he would pay more then that.

A day or later I return to the bazaar and the SAME FRIGGIN PERSON is selling
the same helmet I wanted for 1200p while he said is was only worth 700p. Now
he wanted at least 1200p for it. And he only bought it for 800p but now he
needed te money to buy an even better helmet.....

DOH! :(
