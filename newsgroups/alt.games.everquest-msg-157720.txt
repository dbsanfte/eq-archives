I just posted this response there:

"First off, there is absolutely NOTHING that SoE can do about this except to
break the law and declare the package as a Gift, which ups the duty-free
limit to 35 pounds.

Secondly, re-read the Customs guidance about shopping on the internet. They
warn that CARRIERS usually make an admin charge to collect duty on behalf of
Customs. The Post Office do it, DHL do it, UPS do it, and I suspect most
other carriers as well. The charge is usually fixed, which means for a
low-value item (a game) it appears out of proportion, but for a high-value
item (PC, DVD player) it appears a trivial amount.

SoE did what they said: reduced the shipping charge. They charged $10 for
shipping; I have also ordered from Gamestop, who charged me $15 for shipping
and I will STILL have to pay the import duty. Amazon.com would have charged
$26 for 2-3 day delivery but won't ship PoP outside the US, but if they had
I would STILL have to pay the import duty.

The only people you can complain to about the level of charge is the
Carrier, and if you are still unsatisfied, then Customs."


Also from the Sony Store FAQ:

"Are there any additional charges for orders shipped outside the USA?

For shipments outside the United States, additional Customs import duties
and/or taxes may be applicable in the recipient country. The party receiving
the shipment is responsible for paying any such Customs duties and/or taxes.
Please check with your local government to determine what, if any, customs
duties and/or taxes may be required."

And from the PoP pre order page:

"EUROPEAN/AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMERS ONLY, pre-order for $39.99 (USD), while
supplies last!!

To see if you qualify to receive this shipping discount click here for the
list of eligible countries. This price includes the expansion for $29.99 and
shipping and handling for $10.00; Customs import duties and/or taxes may be
applicable. Click here if you wish to cancel an existing pre-order and take
advantage of this special opportunity."

See the bit about Custom duties?

Bottom line, it is something that SoE have no control over, and no knowldege
of what individual countries and carriers may/may not charge.
