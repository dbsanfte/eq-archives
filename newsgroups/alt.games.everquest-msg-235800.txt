you can use norton ghost it will effectively copy everything from one drive
to another including boot sectors and what not so it would work like it does
now. the only problem is the OS wont work properly and may hangup/crash due
to SO MANY things being different. a new system means a new chipset on the
mobo, (A TON of drivers) possibly new/different/MORE drive controllers (some
of which could possibly conflict with the old controller drivers and crash)

etc.

There is no way to get around a reinstall when you upgrade your system. its
the price to pay.

once you ran norton ghost or similiar program you could try booting from the
startup disk or whatever and tell it to scan and repair but I really dont
think that would work in the way desired.
