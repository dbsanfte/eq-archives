Thanks for all the good info.  When I did the corruptor part in EK we had 3
full groups of 45-55 just to be safe.  I would of hated to see the damn
thing de-spawn after I did all the initial work.  I will probably bring 2-3
groups to CoM when I am ready.  Definiatly a monk I like the FD pull idea,
as well as a few clerics to rez incase the reaver hadn't dropped yet and we
need to keep going =)

Thanks again:
