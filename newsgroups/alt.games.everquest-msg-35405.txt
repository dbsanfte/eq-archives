Ahh, good. Please email me and I will donate my "Crushbone Belts And Pads" 
exploit to you- there's a guy that gives you experience for them!!!

Of course! I'm never crass, snide, and unconstructive! Sarcastic, yes, but 
never crass, snide, and unconstructive.

If you would like my most constructive tip for you, it's this:

Stop spamming this newsgroup with the address of a site that has no utility 
value to 99.99999% of this group. That way we don't have to complain to 
att.net or your webhost, HOSTING4U.NET. See? Thats a good tip. You win, we 
win, and everyone stays happy.
