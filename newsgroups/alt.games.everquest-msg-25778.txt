Heh. On the other hand... I was talking to a Level 60 ranger yesterday
about a port out of the Overthere, when he hit a lagspike and fell down
the gorge. He couldn't pull his body out for some reason (do rangers
ever get Camo or Invis?), so I parachuted down the gorge and dragged it
out to the FM zone, all the while shitting my pants because it was my
first time in Overthere, didn't know any of the landmarks, and the
Skorpiki were all deep red to me.

Anyway, I rescue his corpse (did he say thanks? Did he buggery), we wait
for a cleric, he gets a rez (all this process too over an hour), I port
him to WC and then I gate back and port his twink, and he goes and pays
me 30pp instead of the agreed 40pp because "sorry, that's all the money
I have". This is a lvl 60 ranger with the Epic weapon and all kinds of
mutant-looking armor.

Oh well... friends in high places. =p
