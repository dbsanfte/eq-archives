True, but the OP wanted to know if he could connect to a European
server.  He can, but not the UbiSoft ones, as has been pointed out.
However, it was implied that Kane Bayle and Antonius Bayle are not
European servers, which they are (at least in terms of location).  The
distinction is blurred since the UbiSoft servers came on line.

In any case, I don't find location to be much of an issue.  I spend
all my time on Test and AB, and have noticed very little difference in
performance due to packet lag or loss.  FV was also the same, although
I've spent much less time there.
