If the book you're talking about is the "Tome of Order and Discord" your
character starts with, you can destroy it. If you turn it in to the Priest
of Discord in North Qeynos, it'll make you permanently PvP, which is
basically meaningless on the non-PvP servers. It just severely limits what
you and others can do to assist you in fighting, healing, hunting, grouping,
etc. The Temple of Thunder is the Paladin guild (training area) in South
Qeynos where you meet your trainer and get your tunic and some XP. You go
there and give the note to the person it says (I think it's Chesgard Sydwen)
and he welcomes you to the Paladin guild and gives you a Paladin tunic, some
XP and usually your first quest to complete. If you already have decent
armor, don't worry about the tunic becuase it doesn't provide much in terms
of AC, but the XP is OK.

Here's some sites where there's a ton of good reading. Take a break and read
