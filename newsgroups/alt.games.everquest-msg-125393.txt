Usually this is someone who will exchange gold / silver for plat,
making a profit on the side (usually 10% or so) (e.g 110 gold for 10
plat) thus allowing the player who got the plat to keep hunting,
instead of running 3 zones to bank it all that gold.

Also, most guilds have "banker" characters - an alt of a guild member
who is used to hold items for distribution to the rest of the guild -
i.e. dropped spells, spell components, gems, equipment and money. 
With 16 container slots and 8 or 10 slots per container that provides
room to store around 150 items, (more if they are stackable) per
"banker".

Tzen.
