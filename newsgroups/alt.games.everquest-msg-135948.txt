Do you, in all honesty, actually think that what I said (quoted above)
has anything vaguely resembling the meaning you gave it?

Hmm, interesting.  So I call *you* a bigot and explain exactly why,
and you take that to mean that I called *everyone* who disagrees with
me a bigot?   Why do you even bother posting to Usenet if you filter
out what everyone else writes anyway?  Just talk to yourself, it will
save a lot of time.

Of course this spares you from actually countering my accusation!
