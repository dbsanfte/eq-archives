FYI... In the future you can also get a Chipped Bone Rod (3 charges of locate
corpse), they cost about 6pp and you can buy them in various places. What you do
is buy one (or several), equip it in your primary slot, target yourself and
right click the rod from inventory. It will spin you in the direction of your
corpse. Now here's the tricky part... you have to walk in that direction without
turning until you come across your corpse. If you turn, even a little bit, you
have to recast it and let it turn you in your corpse's direction again. You
might want to buy 3 or 4 of them just in case. Keep doing that until you come
across your corpse.

 Of course, getting a Necro to summon it is lots easier, but if you can't find a
necro the Chipped Bone Rod is one option.
