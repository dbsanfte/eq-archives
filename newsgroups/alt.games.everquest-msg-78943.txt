me2. I dont believe my computer is actually number crunching for the whole 3
or 4 minutes.
Ive noticed that for most of the time, the computer isnt accessing the hard
disk, and seems to be sending information back and forth over the modem.
Just a guess, but I think there is so much waiting going on, the latency
kills it.
Emerald jungle is another one. Most people I port to EJ are in TT by the
time I appear in EJ.
btw I have a 733 P3 with 256 meg, a permanent 1 gig swap file, texture
caching on, luclin models off, medium texture quality, and mipmapping off.
There is no way my pc is spending 3 or 4 minutes loading textures.
