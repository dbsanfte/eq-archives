Well Berth suggested having someone cast something (Deadeye) on you, not
me, I was simply pointing out that if you were gonna do that then lots
of casters have a suitable spell. Not much use in PvP if you have to run
and find a caster every time a rogue tries to gank you. The summoned
staff sounds a better idea - at least it would last a whole play
session.
