But problem is it still takes an insanely long amount of time for an Iksar
to be able to bank, or buy/sell anywhere outside Cabalis.  I've got an Iksar
monk that is up to LV12 but it was getting pretty boring in Field of Bone
and Lake of Ill Omen, not to mention hard to find anything my LV to hunt.
And the other 2 zones near there are so unpopulated with spread out mobs
that they're even worse.  I want to get off that island, but I'm KOS
everywhere with many many many hours of faction work just to be severely
hated by everyone.
