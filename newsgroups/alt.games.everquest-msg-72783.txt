Because they're lazy and make the user look like an idiot. Because the
most common users tend to be trolls, h4x0r wannabes, and rude,
arrogant little spoiled brats who are playing with daddy's computer.

'u' and 'r' save 2 keystrokes each. Even for a slow typer, that's less
than 2 seconds' worth of typing. If you were abreviating a
significantly long word or phrase such as "As far as I know" into
"afaik", fine. But shaving 2-4 keystrokes is just plain laziness.
