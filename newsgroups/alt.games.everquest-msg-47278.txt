The proposed and expected methods of delivery will highly dilute the
concentrated agent. This means that gas masks will be useful. Especially if
they are blistering agents. In essence the affected will be exposed to a
highly diluted form of the agent...

Even if you are near ground zero of a non diluted release, you can limit and
improve your family's chances of survival.

I offered some support for the generally known methods to protect yourself.
Even if many are choosing to inform people to ignore their own self
preservation, in order to try and calm the public. Frankly, my interests are
for my family, as yours should be as well. We are united, but we are not
going to be sheep. Be smart, do what you can within your own realm of
limits. That is the best thing you can do.

This is about the rest of your life, not some short campaign. We are going
to be dealing with this off and on forever. Regardless of our response to
the 11th.
