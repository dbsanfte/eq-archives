I never encouraged him.  That would be saying something like "Go on, you can
do it!"  It's his judgment whether he wants to do it.  I am not responsible
for his or anyone else's actions.  It's just like the people who bitched
that Columbine was a result of Doom and Marilyn Manson.  id Software and
Marilyn Manson never told the kids to do anything, they did it, nothing and
noone else is responsible.  According to some lawmakers, writing in your
diary does encourage unlawful acts, since someone was recently arrested for
doing just that.  I agree with you on that point.  It's 1984.  When did I
ever say that I think laws don't apply to me?  When did I ever say that
stealing is ok?  Never did I do either.  You are incorrectly inferring it.
