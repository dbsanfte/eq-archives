Oh, I should mention that the mobs do run, so snare or root is handy 
(getting chanter to NOT ROOT is nuisance, and really I wasn't taking 
that much damage so I shouldn't care but its the principle!)

And they seem to mostly drop weapons which apparantly vendor for 5pp 
each, not like the Shivs dropped by the scouts in Dulak; advice is to 
bring empty bags and fill em up while taking care of business

Any other observations about TM would be welcome of course.
