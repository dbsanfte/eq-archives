Back when Verant didn't tell us jack crap about stats (they still don't
really, but they did inform us a while back about what they REALLY do), some
people did some testing and found that they missed less with higher
strength. The only explanation that anyone could come up with was that
misses were actually hits for 0 and that the extra strength made some of
those go away. I'm not smokin' the whacky tobaccy and actually saw this with
my own eyes. :)
