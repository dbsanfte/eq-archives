I've got a just dinged 24 Magician on Morell Thule... a little twinked, but
not ferociously
Anyway, having an enchanter of 53rd level with a research of around 170, I
don't want to research again, but it won't let my enchanter do the research
combines for my mage.

anyway, I was wondering if I gather all the components (including the 20th
level spells) if someone would be willing to do the combines on say my 24th
and 29th level research only spells. I'll pay for the time and effort of
course. I hung out in the bazaar trying to find someone but no luck, and
noone seems to be selling the finished spells either (well for about a week
I saw someone that had the 24 fire pet for sale for 10k, but I'll live
without it if it is that expensive).
