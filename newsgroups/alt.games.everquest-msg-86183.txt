ROTFLMFAO!

Oh man this game never ceases to amuse me.

My favorite was when my druid was buying spells at the NK druid ring
and I see a party of characters there obviously waiting for a
port or a friend to join them because most of them were sitting
down. (Mistake #1 sitting in the open with wandering kos green animals
at a druid ring) Now along comes a wolf and jumps one of the sitters.
Get this the sitter starts attacking the wolf! (Mistake #2 attacking wolves
in sight of NPC druids, let alone at the NK druid ring!) So I quickly type
"RUN!" The idiot replies "why? I can kill these wolves easy?" DOH! Now it
takes a few seconds for the NPC druids to respond because they are
a little out of range, finally 2 of the NPC druids path over to the idiot and
start wailing on him. End of story right? Nope, the idiot's group/friends
join the battle! and start helping him by healing him and attacking the DRUIDS!
(Mistake #3 helping kos people against certain death NPCs) LOL!
About this time the Treants and Briana Treewhisper notice the ruckus
and bring the hammer down! (I should note that I once saw Briana take on
3 HGs and a griffon in quick succession without even breaking a sweat.)
Some of them finally tried to run but its awfully hard to out run druids, hehehehe.
Get this they actually yelled for me to help them LOL! When they all finally
died the first idiot sent me a tell and actually berated me for not helping him!
LOL again! I was rolling! I said "Let me get this straight you wanted me,
a druid, to help you against impossible odds against NPCs in my own guild? LOL"

I should note that these were not newbies, they were in their 30's and 40s.
I related this over guildchat and had everyone in the guild rolling. To this
day I still think about this and get a chuckle out of it. Definitely one of
those EQ memories I will keep forever.

Although I have to admit I am amazed at the length some
people will go to raise faction some places. I was actually
amazed to see a Dwarf PALADIN at the bank in Cabilis!
That must be what 8,000 goblins and 10,000 bone chips
to get that far? Sheesh.
