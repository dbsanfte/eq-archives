Do they land in the pool?  

I might make a brell worshipping cleric to test this:
Jump from the tunnel - record /loc in Paineel and 
landing zone /loc in The Hole.  Find the /loc to the
pool at the bottom of the falls and use the previous 
set of locs to map it to one in Paineel.  If that /loc
is over the Hole, you should be able to lev out over
to it, and fall through to pool :)  Of course, it took
7 of us 30-40 minutes to chew our way through to the
tower the other day, so it's not nearly as useful now
as it was :/
