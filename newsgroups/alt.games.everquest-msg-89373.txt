Also from that same article:

"GS: Will any of the exclusive Legends content eventually make its way
to onto the non-premium servers?

JS: Yes, but only after Legends folks have had time with it first. "


Personally, if I was on the legends server I'd be pissed if ANY content
went to the regular servers. I pay more I should get more. What
is the point of paying more to get something everyone else is going to
get a couple months later? Just to be first? Big whoop!

I would sign up just to take a look but all my friends are on a regular
server and they are too cheap to upgrade. =) Oh well hopefully
we will get reports from some legends players on what they get
for the extra $30 a month.

I like this quote from the article:

"GS: What is the service designed to provide?

JS: We're trying to provide much more of a tabletop RPG experience
to our Legends customers. We really want to try to have people feel
like they are part of a world that's changing at a much more rapid pace.
In fact, players will feel like they impact the world in a much greater
way. For example, if players complete a specific dynamic quest, they
could end up getting a sword named after them. Eventually, that sword
could find its way to other servers. How cool would it be to have other
people getting the "Sword of (your character)" and know that the epic
adventure you had on Legends is what led to that item actually being
created. That's the level we're going to go to. It's going to be absolutely
mind-blowing."


Mind-blowing? I'm sorry but all I could think was "yawn."
If having a sword named after you is "mind-blowing" these guys need
to get out a little more.
