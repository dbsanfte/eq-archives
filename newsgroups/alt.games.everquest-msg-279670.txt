I'm in the middle ground where I haven't been playing long enough to
have burned out on original characters, so I don't really want to take
time away from them to try your idea, but it does sound interesting.
(My characters are "self-twinked" in that they've earned money to pay
for bazaar gear, but except for my more recent alts I've mostly not
gotten hand-me-downs from higher levels.)

Some fine points that you'll need to think about:

It's fine to say you won't pay for level-inappropriate buffs, but what
about free buffs?  If someone passes through your newbie zone and gives
you SOW or a high-level DS, will you click it off?  What if you had a
level-appropriate buff from a groupmate who's since camped, and a
passing stranger overwrites it with a higher level buff?

If you decide to work on, say, tailoring, and need some smithing or
brewing done to make some of the ingredients, do you have to do the
smithing/brewing yourself?  That sort of defeats the point of it being
a multi-player game, so I assume you could at least have someone else
in the guild do those parts.  But can you go out and hire someone to
do the combines if you provide the ingredients?

You don't need to write a legal contract covering these things, nor do
you even need to enforce them, or even be consistent about them, but
you should at least have some idea where you intend to draw the line
at interacting with the rest of the "massively multiplayer" part of
the game.

Good luck, and I hope you have fun!  (That's the important part, after
all!)
