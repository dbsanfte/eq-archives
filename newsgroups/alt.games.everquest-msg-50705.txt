Just for a bit of thread convergence, THIS is a big part of why I
twink my secondary characters. Now that I've finally learned how to
play a warrior, which everyone understands and a necromancer, which
doesn't need anybody to understand him, I'm trying the much more
subtle rogue class. But, the fact is that most people don't figure out
what rogues are good for until 40+. If my rogue is ever going to get
to that level, it's going to require a fair amount of soloing or else
constantly trying to educate the server as to how useful rogues are.
