The reason they don't sell is because people don't know about them.
Until the patch where the interdependancy changes go in, there is no
way to search for poisons as a category on the vendor.  If you can't
search for them, it makes it hard to know what is even a poison without
examining each item... Indulgence of Hate isn't the name I'd pick for a
poison.

I'm willing to bet that as soon as scouts are able to search the
brokers for poisons, they will sell like hotcakes.  As long as they are
resonably priced, of course.
