Not so.  I mean, its an assumption, sure, but a "pretty safe" one?  That 
would mean the odds favor it being correct.

Since I tend not to try and log in till official patch time estimate is 
over, and since at roughly that time there's a throng of people trying 
to log in, I'd say its very likely that I'm actually hitting the "too 
many people trying to log in at once" wall instead of the "we aren't 
really thru yet" one.

And since I've been thru patches in which they mess up the patch somehow 
which prevents me from logging in, its also quite possible (not likely, 
I admit, as its probably only happened to me once per year) that rather 
than a patch or overcrowding, I'm facing something that requires more 
work on my part rather than just wait and retry.

This most recent patch they specifically mentioned they were patching 
the login server, so the odds of there being a glitch there went up 
significantly.
