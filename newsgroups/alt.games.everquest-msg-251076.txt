A couple of things to consider.

1.  What percentage of an XBox game's execution is spent in
the DirectX API? (which *has* to be ported to native code for
a switch like that to work)

2.  Given that DirectX is available on the XBox, what makes
you think graphics calls won't be transparently routed to the
video card on the XBox2 rather than some old card?

If the Native processor is fast enough and enough execution
time is spent in the API, then a pretty transparent emulation
of the XBox should be possible.
