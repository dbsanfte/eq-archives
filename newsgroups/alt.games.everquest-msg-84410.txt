A monk I've grouped with several times was selling one when I was passing 
through FV.  I paid 2kpp for it and think I got a bargin.  It's definately 
40% as good as a tinkerer's bag.  
I did feel a bit silly putting my resist gear in there, all 10 items 
probably weigh less than 5 stone.  I should probably feel more silly for 
paying 600pp for 7 10-slot backpacks, in Bazaar, for my bank.
