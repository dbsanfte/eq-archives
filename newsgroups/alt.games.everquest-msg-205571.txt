Get a decent group including a mezzer (Enchanter or Necro) and a
competent healer (any priest class will do) and do Kaesora.  A
Druid or Wizard is a plus, _especially_ if you do not have a
rezzer, but also if you don't want to have to figure out the walk
out (drop-offs prevent you from just going back the way you came).
A high 30s group should be able to handle it even exploring (tho
you might take a few deaths or even a wipe if you are not cautious
enough), as a lo-/mid-30s group handled it fine with people who knew
the zone in the group.  It sucks without a mezzer tho, too many
places where you just can't single pull and there are mobs that cast
GHeal, DoTs, and nukes.  Lots of undead, but plenty of spiders and
"sperm" model mobs as well.  The loot won't be exciting to somebody
on a production server (we liked it well enough on Stromm tho), but
Xalgoz (the dungeon's boss mob) drops one of the pieces you need for
your Howling Stones key.
