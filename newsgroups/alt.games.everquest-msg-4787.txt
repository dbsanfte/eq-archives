Not meaning to be rude or anything, but people insist on spreading
this myth because it's the truth.  At level 24, you have to give two
weapons to a pet to get it to dual wield.  Later on, according to the
Verant patch messages, you can get pets that will dual wield without a
weapon.  I believe that happens at level 39 (see
www.magecompendium.com ) .  This is also according to the November 25
and November 29, 2000 patch message, as archived on EQ Castersrealm
(eq.castersrealm.com).  So on this point, I'm afraid you are in error.

Oh, and the levels I'm mentioning are, according to Absor, for both
the necromancer and the magician pets.  In other words, it looks like
they are treated the same in this category.

No problems with any other parts of your post, you're pretty much spot
on for the rest of it.
