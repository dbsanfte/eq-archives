I am very interested in this guild, I live in the UK and have been an EQ
addict for the last 2 years. Unfortunately I've had some very bad
experiences with guilds in the past, but I'm sure that was just because I
got involved with the wrong ones. I'll check out your web site and send you
a tell in game.
