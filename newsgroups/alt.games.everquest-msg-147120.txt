Nevertheless, it is what they do.

Why not?

Should they account themselves according to what
Christians may or may not do.

Should they be saying that, because Christians are
hypocritical, we are justified in being
hypocritical?

I forgive you.

Kaev said he liked the rede, "more and more"

I said "Despite its paradoxical nature"

Lokari said "I see no paradox"

I gave what I perceive as paradoxes in the rede.

Though I quite agree with your "tu quoque"
argument against Christianity, I cannot really see
the relevance. Surely Wicca must stand on its own,
and not define itself, relatively to Christianity.

So you would prefer "Do what thou wilt shall be
the whole of the Law" as well?
