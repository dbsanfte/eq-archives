TRAIN THAT WAS CAUSED BY YOU:
The other night while setting up for a hate raid at the SRO wizard spire. i
got sowed up and went out. and i rounded up ever orc every derv the 3 DE
merchants few spiders 1 hillgiant and i think a few zombies. and trained
them all on my guildmates. :) then we went to hate and got full apothic for
2 mages an enchanter BP and druid shaman items. twas a good nite.

TRAIN THAT YOU PERSONALLY WITNESSED IN GAME:
in Sol B. i saw someone train all of KPC kobolds plus a few others about 20
total. 10(?) lava duct crawlers and a 4 -7 sonic bats to the zone line.
every one was so crowded at the zone line people were gettting stuck and
about 8 people died. (i lived love the monk fd )
