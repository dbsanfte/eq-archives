Is there somewhere that has a good detailed diagram/list of flags
needed to continue to what zones?  I checked google and
Allakhazam's but they weren't really that clear.   The way I read
the one from Alla's webpage says, I need RZ and Agnaar to get
into the 3 elemental planes (water,air,earth) but I don't think that
is correct.

Over the weekend I got flagged for CoD on a Grummus raid,
also killed Agnaar too and from before I have a VZ flag.  Now
that I've been doing a bit of flagging I'd like to know what and
where I need to go next to open up the next zones.  I'm sure I'll
get RZ flagged soon enuf as the guild I've been raiding with is
pretty close to dropping him.

Thanks in advance.
