So you turn on the invunerability mode when playing DOOM or Quake?

What you are making is a value judgement here. Granted you happen to be with
the popular vote of virtually all MMPOG players in that easier is better.

I mean people do things like Naked Gnomes Across Norath races. It would be
easier to just have a druid port them now wouldn't it?

I think that is the definition of power gaming.

Once again, I seem to make this post about every 6 months, not everyone
wants to play a serf mucking stables for "The Man." Personally I *DO* sell
bone chips and silk swatches.


Given the choice between finding a cracked staff and maybe a plague rat tail
or toiling in the newbie areas for hides and bone chips, lots of people
choose the former. Just the way they are.
