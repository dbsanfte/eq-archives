You can go through 5+ years of EQ and never have dueled.  Saying most
are PVP is wrong.  They may have PVP options or designated servers but
but most are not in that vein.
And competition is not what I see most of the time, rather
cooperation.  Groups may compete for locale or who gets to XYZ zone
first but direct competition is very little, from what I've seen
anyway.

They'll get it once.  Because, as I stated before, if the guy in uber
gear blows goats he's not going to get a group with those people
again.  And after a few of those word will get around.  Just because
someone has firepower it doesn't mean they know what they're doing.
And skill is more important than gear, imo.

Well, if you argue this then the the reverse is also true.  Which is
what the whole discussion was about.  I find it doesn't really matter.
I've not grouped with uber geared people because they sucked.  Now if
I'm trying to break into PoTB or something maybe gear becomes an
issue, but you can have a badass tank that is an idiot and everyone
loses.
Point is, just because they haven't played every day to get the uber
gear doesn't mean they aren't skilled at the game.

Not the same, as I stated above.  It wouldn't matter how much uber
gear I bought in Half-Life, I would get owned by the skilled guy with
a pistol.  It's just a matter of skill for the game in question.
I know a few people who had not played EQ before but had played D&D
for years.  Once they got the basic mechanics down they rocked.  Not
because of gear but because of skill in an RPG.
By contrast, I can't play an FPS for crap.  No matter what gear I
have.

Again, not the same thing.  Skill will (almost) always win out over
gear.  The race car analogy was a good one.  If you can't drive worth
crap anyway, what good is a Ferrari going to do you?  You'll just go
out in flames faster is all.
