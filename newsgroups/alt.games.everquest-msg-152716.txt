    Which is good. You can't spread out a static user base over more and
more zones without more and more zones being completely useless.

    EQ won't die as long as stuff gets revamped. There's no difference
between Cazic Thule being revamped into CT v2.0 and buying an expansion with
"the new home of the lizards" in it. Wait, I saved money by getting the free
upgrade - there IS a difference!

    I agree things will die if only fixing happens. But that's not what they
asked us.

    To be honest, I doubt they knew that people wouldn't want this. They've
been so wrong about what people want in the past that I can't see them
figuring it out now.

    I asked them to stop releasing new zones that don't work, and fix and
revamp the ones we have so people will use them. Hopefully they'll do it. EQ
is my first, and LAST, online game. When I leave EQ, they lose my
subscription fees for good. And a good number of the people I know in EQ are
the exact same way.
