One of the local TV stations just aired an "investigative report" on
online gaming "addiction" Monday night.  Needless to say the story
focussed on that lovely little incident.  As usual, there was no news
and prescious little information.  No attempt to, for instance,
compare the "risk of suicide while playing online games" to the risk
of death or serious injury while attending an automobile race, in
terms of injuries vs. "man-hours".  They also reported various highly
scientific "factoids" like the claim that 60% of the respondents to
a "survey of online gamers" considered themselves "addicted".  I'm
sure glad that our heroes of the small screen are out there defending
us and our children from this unconscionable corruption at the hands of
a competing entertainment venue, aren't you?
