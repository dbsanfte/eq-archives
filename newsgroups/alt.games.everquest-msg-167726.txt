I think they need to add one or two more crazed goblin camps to the BB
zone.I hear that's a good place for a lev 31 druid ,but its always
camped.The one time it wasn't,of course,is when I popped in for 45mins while
on break from work.Unsurprisingly I got a tell about porting this guy,no big
deal usually but the gobbies are open.Had to explain the situation to him to
get him to go away,he understood.But I digress,anyway what do you guys
think?
