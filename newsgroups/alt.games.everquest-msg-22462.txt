If they intend to play the high level game (50+) enchanter and cleric.
These 2 are a Tank magnet, advertise that a cleric and chanter are
starting a grp past 15 or so and people will come a running. Both
classes are very desirable on any form of raid. For reasons that
should be obvious. 

If they intend to play the powerfarmer game, go Druid and Necro. Druid
for utility to support the necro and move him about, Necro to kill
everything in sight.

Both classes need to excpect to have no friends and no grouping
abilities in later life. And neither are wanted much on raids. Druids
for ports TO the raid, necros for CR AFTER the raid, otherwise forget
being invited.

As approximately 50-80% of a toons life after 55 is dedicated to
raids, I feel the chanter cleric is the way to go. You will make
1000's of friends and enjoy the more difficult challenges in the way
the game was designed top be played. GROUPS

Just expect a tuff run till 16 when the chanter gets Breeze. :/ Same
with the cleric till 24. After that you will level like madmen.
