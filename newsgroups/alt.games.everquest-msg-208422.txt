 Because as a puller I have situations where I use three out of the four
previous 4 camera angles and having them all bound to one key is nice.
I'll adapt to the added one eventually but I still think it's a
pointless addition. Being able to edit which ones I cycle through would
be the best solution. When I'm running with 6 level 70 mobs on my ass
the last thing I want to be doing is having to press 3 different keys.
