ok, today a bought an asus a7v8x motherboard and athlon xp 2200+ cpu.
i'm having a few issues at the moment that i'm hoping some of you can
help out with.

first of all, when i boot, it lists my serial bus controller four
times, all of them with vendorID 1106. three have deviceID 3038, one
has 3104, and each has a different function number 0,1,2,3. what does
this mean? i have everything installed that came with the mb but i'm
going to remove that extra usb thing and that digital audio thing and
hopefully see if something happens.

another thing is that when i start up windows (98se) each and every
time, it will find a new device and try to install drivers for it.
it's the universal serial bus controller, and i have the asus cd and
win98 cd at the ready. it does this up to 4 times (new device, get
driver, finish) and is very frustrating! i look in my device manager
and it lists usb controller type drivers 4 times. i have no idea
what's going on and i don't even use usb at the moment so what should
i do?

last thing. upon my first successful bootup of win98 without having to
install any more drivers, etc, i try to run everquest. it works fine
and patched fine. i tried to log a character in but i forgot to
install PoP. this is after i download the files for ykesha. so i
install PoP, reboot, and it works fine. i reboot again after a while
and now i can't get into eq at all. i hit play at the patcher screen
and it just dies. i tried doing a complete file scan and it still
doesn't work. it's got to be a hardware issue and that is why i'm
posting on both these groups. i'm hoping some of you may have had
similar problems and found some ingenious ways to fix them.

please both respond here and send me an email at edmhui00@yahoo.com.
any help will be appreciated. thanks.
