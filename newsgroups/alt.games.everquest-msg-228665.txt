So, for me, during soloing, with KEI, and outdoors:

15 (CanniV (about 1/2 efficiency here, rarely do I maximize efficiency))
20 (CanniIV (about 1/3 efficiency here, probably conservative))
11 (FT11)
3  (MC3)
14 (KEI)
18 (Horse (lose a few ticks due to moving when I need to reroot))

So, around 80 mana per tick, varies a lot depending on where I am 
soloing, this is assuming root/rotting in BoT or PoV.  Without KEI, it's 
still a respectable 55ish mana per tick.

Going full out mana regen from death

28 (CanniV)
60 (CanniIV)
11 (FT11)
3  (MC3)
20 (Horse(Can hit this without horse by cannidancing))

122 mana per tick with no outside buffs, so, definitely below mage, but 
above the other classes.
