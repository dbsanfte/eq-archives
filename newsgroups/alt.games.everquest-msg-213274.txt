Vethril Sathir's Remains is indifferent to (probably) everyone.  He's a
quest turn-in NPC.  VS himself (once you do those 2 turn-ins) IS of course
KOS to most people...but you're supposed to kill him anyway. :)  As Dave E
said, the quest VS is easier than the main one.

Just like the quest Faydedar is supposed to be easier than the real one
(though it seemed we killed him easily enough).
