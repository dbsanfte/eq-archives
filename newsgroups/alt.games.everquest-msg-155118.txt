Actually a while back VI stated that Cha was a tertiary stat for charm/mez
duration, however it was related to class, for example necros aren't as
reliant upon Cha for their undead charms (why does a decaying corpse care if
you have a wart on your nose?) as Enchanters are on Cha (I'm sure that
despite how much he hates you, that Big Angry Giant (tm) is more likely to
become enraptured by your gaze if you don't look like your face has been
through the meat grinder), my personal guess is that druid charm/cha
reliance is somewhere in the middle.  Either way I don't notice much
problems charming with my 77 cha, although some animals are annoyingly
resistant (SG fish and seahorses) but cha doesn't help much there.  Also,
AnimalTash (Glamour of Tunare) seems to have a much greater influence on
charm duration than any other variable that I have control over.
