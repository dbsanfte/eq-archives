Seems like a decent box, had usb2 ports up front I think the box was $800. The Alienware was a P4 2ghz box for $999 with about the same specs for everything else. I remember in the back of my mind that someone once told me AW boxes are easily upgradable, is that the case? Is it worth the extra $200 for the "slower" box and will this handle most gaming?

Well Id agree on HP and Compaq about not being upgradeable, but Dell
is most certainly upgradeable.  Can replace the CPU, Video Card,
Sound, Memory, Hard Drive... what else is there to upgrade?  The
mother board?  well then you wouldnt have a dell anymore... you would
have a home build system...
oh and gateway... they just SUCK.... personal opinion.
