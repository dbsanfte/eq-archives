 Yes. Unless you get lucky and find him up when you get there.

>Any PH for him?

 Yes. Either a normal bodyguard or sometimes a Warlord. Counting the
four spots clockwise, he spawns in the third one. Or back wall, left
corner. However you want to describe it.

>How many ppl will it take to down him?

 Depends on level. I'd say at least two. The room isn't an easy pull
since even at 60 they wont come single. However, you can get a Druid or
Ranger to Harmony them first.

 Yes.

 Correct. I don't think Pawduster is a soloable camp. The Betrayer in
Chardok will require a strong group as well.
