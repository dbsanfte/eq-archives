There are all sorts of stories on how to get Grimrot to spwan but basiclly
the Live Lord Grimrot will spwan during the day and the Undead Grimrot at
night. the Rest is just timing the spwans to get the one you want. When I
camped Grimrot I binded my self to his location and came back every 4 hours
1 hour time to claim the Camp and hold it. I also had a couple of guild
members bound there also for the Live Grimrot. Took me about a week to get
both. 1 other tip be sure you high enough faction I would suggest ally
otherwise you will end up with a (Thank You you have just been shafted).
Tere is no way a 34 Cleric can solo the Live Lord Grimrot you will need
help.
