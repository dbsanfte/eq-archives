That kinda depends on the time of day.  If the FV zone is pretty well
populated then theres a better chance peeps are hunting spiders which will
cut down on their numbers a bit.  Otherwise its  possible to emerge from the
tunnel to DL in the mists of a dozen of them...  they occassionally still
try and cast on my 54 Shaman which is quite usless but it happens none the
less.  There always seems to be a few NPC guard/tracker types running out of
the tunnel so just pop out after one of them and yes.......  Hug the wall
and run like hell!  Spiders see through invis too.
