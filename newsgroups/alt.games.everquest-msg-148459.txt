I like this other key sentence;

forces were mostly women and children," the report
said.

How about balancing that account from a
conservative website with something from a
socialist website. 

The article is entitled;
"A blatant cover-up: US releases report on Afghan
massacre"

http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/sep2002/afgh-s12_prn.shtml

One of the key paragraphs;

"On the face of it, the official account is
absurd: Taliban fighters, with the assistance of
Kakarak villagers, plant an anti-aircraft gun in
the midst of a wedding party, fire on a US gunship
which responds with a devastating barrage that
kills nearly 50 people and wounds over a hundred.
Yet in the midst of the mayhem, the gun, still
presumably largely intact, is removed from the
scene along with spent ammunition and any other
signs of its presence. And all of the survivors
lie to protect the Taliban"

"....But those at the wedding party had no
motivation for lying�many of them were close
supporters of the US-backed Afghan President Hamid
Karzai, who personally knew some of the dead. As
Muhammad Shah told the New York Times, �We were
the first to help Hamid Karzai, so we did not
think they [the US] would bomb our village.�"
