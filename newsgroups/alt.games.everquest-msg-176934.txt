There are several classes that get a level 49 Paralyzing Earth spell. Check
to see whether it is WIZ useable first. In the bazaar, set class to wizard
when searching for spells, so you dont end up with the wrong spell types.
Also, with my uber research skill of 59 :) i managed to combine and scribe
this spell myself. I guess that was very lucky though.

I dont use this spell at all. It's actually worthless, since your nukes will
break the root anyway, and this root costs too much mana to keep recasting.
I still stick with my level 4 root when needed.
