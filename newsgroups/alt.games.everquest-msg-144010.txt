I started Rouge character and he is at level 12 now.  I am focusing on
keeping most of my fighting skills up to maximum at each level.  One of my
skill that is still at "1" is Pick Lock Skill.  I tried to pick lock at
Freeport Bank and at Befallen but it seems to go nowhere.   How do you
practice this skill?

Emilio.
