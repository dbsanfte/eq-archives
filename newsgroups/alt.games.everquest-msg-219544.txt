I must say I love the idea discussed here.  Clicking "combine" never 
really made sense to me, and this has much more flavour to it.  It will 
be interesting to see to what extent player skill (hand/eye 
coordination etc) affects the process compared to character 
skill/stats.

On the other points raise, I've no objection to it being difficult to 
become a master, nor to it taking a long time.  Why it needs to be 
boring is hard to understand, difficulty and time investment required 
could be a sufficient barrier to prevent everyone doing it.  Currently 
it isn't difficult.
