I agree.

I don't know the role of guides all that well myself, but I do know
that they're essentially powerless with regards to enforcement. It
seems that mostly they serve as buffers between the players and the
GMs.

The potential is that a guide with the power to change names could
simply run around changing names of players without valid cause, for
no better reason than he felt like it.

Yes, that's about the extent of it. However, by that time the
(hypothetical) damage would already have been done. In other words, by
the time Verant knew about and acted against what you might call a
"rogue guide", there would already be at least one justifiably pissed
off customer.
