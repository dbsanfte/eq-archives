   You're welcome.  And don't feel like you have to justify your characters
level to anyone.  If you don't want to (or can't find the time to) level, then
that's on you.   I've been playing for almost 3 years, and my highest level
character is 46.  I play alot, and I do have a guild.  I just don't really care
that much about getting to the upper end.  Play the way you want to, not the way
others like to.
