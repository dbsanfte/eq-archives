Go to velkators, where you have your choice of being equally safe and
bored while killing blues with a much better velium drop rate, or
actually having fun doing some of the named upstairs for first rate loot
and good exp in addition to the velium.

It is kind of depressing that it is necessary for the makers of this
game to force people to stop doing things that are boring to them. You
would think people would stop playing once they start to see boredom
setting in.

It is, after all, a game.

But you can see why they think it is necessary - it is hardly the best
PR for the game if a large proportion of the people playing it
constantly complain about how bored they are.
