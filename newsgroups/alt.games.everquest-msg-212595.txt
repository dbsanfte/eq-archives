No sir.  The Creator's existence transcends our universe.  It's
true that _we_ can never know everything (Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle), but that has no implications for a Creator who is not
bound by the same rules.  As I pointed out elsewhere, the mere
possibility that, for the Creator, omnipotence and omniscience are
indistinct (i.e. to create is to know, to know is to create) makes
any claim that they are mutually exclusive unsupportable.  It also
allows free will (we are created that way) in the context of a
Creator who "knows everything".
