Many years ago, a regular newspaper humor columnist (Erma Bombeck,
perhaps?) had a column discussing this sort of thing.  She started
out by saying something like, people say it's okay if you talk to
yourself, you're only in trouble if you answer.  She then went on
for a while about a time she asked herself a question and answered
it and so forth.  At the end, she said,

   The other day I not only asked myself a question and answered it, but I
   then said to myself, 'I didn't catch that; could you please repeat it?'

   So I told myself, 'If you're not going to pay attention, I'm going to
   stop talking to you!'

   I'm in trouble.
