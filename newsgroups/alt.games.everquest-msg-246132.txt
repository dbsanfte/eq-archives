At the risk of sounding like chicken little, I'm beginning to suspect that
CoH might be a very real threat to EQ.  A fun game coming out at a time
when EQ has become decided un-fun for new players and uninspiring for old
players...well, it's no surprise I keep hearing the same story of "I
didn't intend to quit EQ, but I haven't logged into it for a week or
two" all over. Course, that doesn't really matter if folks keep their EQ
subscriptions. It's just amusing to me that CoH has succeeded in capturing
attention where Horizons, Shadowbane, and Lineage 2 failed.  Because,
well, CoH is *fun*.  :D
