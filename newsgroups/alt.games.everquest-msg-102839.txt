No actually, my level 18 got exp in a group with a 52.  As long as she sat 
far enough away from the fight.

It's a good rule and a good guideline. It will usually work that way, but 
I have seen the rare exception, usually seeming to depend on what level 
mob you were fighting in some strange way.  And even then, it was never 
off by more than a level or two.
