There are cases where KFing is not enough. When a person's activities
disrupt the newsgroup and clearly violate their ISP's TOS rather than
tempting the boundaries of it, then that person gets reported. Such
was the case with Zeppo. He was spamming and his activities qualified
as harassment. Given the history with Airmail so far, I'd say any
users that were disrupting a newsgroup by trolling would be subject to
account termination as well. Airmail's cool.
