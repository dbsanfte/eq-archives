Quick question:  My wood elven ranger is currently sitting beside the 'To
Qeynos' rock in WK encumbered with HQ  and MQ cat pelts.  No one in WK,
Qeynos Hills, or Qeynos is ever interested in buying them .... I guess the
folks figure that if they want the pelts, they'll get 'em themselves.

Would a trip to Erudin or be beneficial to my bank account?  If not, where
would be a good place to auction them off?

TIA
Crash
