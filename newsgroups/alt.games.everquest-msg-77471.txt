I have read the previous messages speculating that these spells increase
your effective level, reduce fizzle, enhance skill learning, improve
channeling, etc.  but now that some more time has passed, does anyone
seriously KNOW what they do?

I am a jeweler and would primarily want the spells ONLY to improve the rate
at which I learn skills and to reduce failed jewelry making attempts.
