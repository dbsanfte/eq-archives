This has happened to me three times in the last week. I don't crash
per se, but I do lock up hard, meaning cntl-alt-del has become a habit
to get back to desktop. An /ooc in Oasis on Prexus one night got me
four replies of the same thing. I was told that by them that you have
to kill something right after dinging and then you can get in your
inventory.

Lovely, huh?
