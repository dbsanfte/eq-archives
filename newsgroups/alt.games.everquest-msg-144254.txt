Unfortunately I can't answer your question as to the how, I wasn't paying
enough attention to how the pullers did things.  I had not gone to Hate
prior to the recent AI upgrades.  I do know that we broke in without any
significant issues, and pulled and killed a lot of single mobs without
significant issues.  We did go to the second floor, and again, ran into no
significant issues doing so, or fighting up there.
