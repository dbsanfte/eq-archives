My sense heading skill is very low. I always forget to work on it. I tend to
do more chatting with people I'm playing with or try hunting stuff and that
sort of thing. I guess my whole hang-up is that I just don't think it should
be such a big deal. It seems that every other RPG out there has some sort of
map you can bring up that will show you where you are. To get that in
Everquest, I had to buy an expansion.
