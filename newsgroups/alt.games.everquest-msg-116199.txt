"character" isn't really accurate, either..."avatar" comes closest to what
they are for most people.

Here's a definition of avatar from dictionary.com, which they attribute to
the Jargon file:

    "An image representing a user in a multi-user virtual reality (or
    VR-like, in the case of Palace) space"

That fits pretty closely to EQ.  Also, one of the non-computer definitions
fits well:

    "A temporary manifestation or aspect of a continuing entity"

Considering the lack of role playing by most players, this last one
describes their EQ thingy pretty well.
