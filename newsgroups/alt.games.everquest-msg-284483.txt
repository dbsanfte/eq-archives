Given what Tony said, actually it *is* true. As long as you continue to
play the mez song, it doesn't matter who your current target is, the song
will continue to affect its original target. You can mez Mob1 and switch
targets and melee Mob2 while singing mez song, and Mob1 will stay mezzed
indefinitely, barring resists, missed notes, death of the bard, etc.
For mobs with high magic resistance that *must* be mezzed for a while,
this can sometimes be a reasonable tactic.

Once you stop playing the mez song, of course, you will have to retarget
the original mob in order to refresh it.
