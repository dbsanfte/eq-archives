wonder how many players there are in europe, asia etc. who would move away
from US servers?

Generally there are about 30,000-40,000 on line at peak times, so assuming
that there are about 60,000 players.
and also assume that there are 33% playing outside the US, thats 20,000
players.
most, like me, I guess will have more than 1 character, I have 6 on the go,
but lets say each player has on average 3.
If 75% of the non US players would rather use their characters on a less
laggy non-US server...
then thats 3x15000 character transfers, from server to server at $50 each...

$2,250,000

Y'know there could be some truth in this rumour about non-US servers...
