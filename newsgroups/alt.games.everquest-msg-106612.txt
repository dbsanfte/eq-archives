Dont port anyone unless they say how much they are paying in the
ooc/auction, that is unless you like time wasters. Not everyone who shouts
"Lookin fer a port" is a timewaster, but rarely will be "20pp for a port to
wherever" be a timewaster. Thats just my (long) experience with it anyway.
People suspected of being "dudes" can pay me first (same a rez's)
