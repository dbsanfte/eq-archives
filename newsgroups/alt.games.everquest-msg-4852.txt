	Well, I'm not the one hiding in the bushes waiting to ambush
other players.  I don't even want to player kill, and anyone
challenges me (as opposed to just coming up behind me and whacking
me--in that case, I'll either try to defend myself, but most likely,
turn tail and run), I'll decline.  I play on a PvP server simply to
play w/ my bf.  It's where he wants to play so I do it.  I don't have
to of course, but it's fun to play a game w/ him.

	I'm not going to worry anymore tho if I die in the game.  It
happens, and I figure I've got things at east 5x worse going on in my
life to be worried if my mage becomes a corpse a few times a day.
