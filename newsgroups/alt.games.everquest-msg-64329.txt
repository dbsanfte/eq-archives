If any files in the EQ directory contain path information (none did
before SoL...I don't know about SoL), they will be small files.  So,
open your EQ directory on C:, sort by size, and take all big files (or
perhaps just all big files that have been modified today), and copy
those over.  You might miss some smaller files this way, but you'll
save having to download the big files.
