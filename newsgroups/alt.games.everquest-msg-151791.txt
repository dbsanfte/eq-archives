Most competent AoE groups won't even look at you in passing for an
invite until you are 56 and have your second Jyll's spell. Before then
you are a liability. And if there are three wizards higher than you
available and LFG, you'll still get passed over. Can't blame them
though. It's a risky business on the best of days, and you want to hedge
your bets as much as you can. The cleric and the chanter can get invited
at lower levels, as soon as the cleric has their first good group heal,
and the chanters have two AoE stuns ready to go.
