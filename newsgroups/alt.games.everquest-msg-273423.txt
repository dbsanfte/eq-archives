> Where do you get  writs in Qeynos and Freeport?

In Freeport you can get them from:
WFP:  Militia House (guy just inside door to the right)
NFP:  Mage Tower (guy off to the corner to the right of the doors) and
War Temple  (guy to the left inside the door)
SFP:  The boat near the north edge of the map (lady on the dock just
before stepping on the boat)

The people I indicated are the first ones to get the writs from, they
will lead you to the higher ones.
