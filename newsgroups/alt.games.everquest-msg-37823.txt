I just /laughed and made fun of the moron who tried doing that to my
SK when she was level 9 and he was 35.

My druid spanked a level 1 red halfling in Rivervale once. Two of them
were running around being annoying. He accepted my duel, I hit him
once and outran the guards to the zone. He died and began to cry >:)
