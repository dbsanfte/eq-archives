Basically it depends on your playing style. My guild has 5 mages, 2
are evoc, 3 are conjuration.
The top evoc mage and me (the top con mage) have about the same dps on
raids and about the same mana use.

If you like the big bolts and/or raining a lot evoc is for you. If you
want more steady simple nukage conjuration works better for sun
vortex/black steel imo.

If you like to solo a lot conjuration saves more mana because of the
petheals, or even chainpets if you use that tactic. Burning a mob down
before it eats your pet simply doesn't work all that well in pop or
god zones.

Lastly, CoH is a conjuration spell. Now this doesn't seem like a
compelling argument, it does mean that a conjuration mage has less
manaproblems when cohing a raid to a certain spot.
