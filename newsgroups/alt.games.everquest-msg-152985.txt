ROTFLMAO!!!

Yes Sebet, thanks for the laugh I needed that. I've had the same experience with the guards in Misty at the gate in the wall. Until
one day I saw an simply awesome sight, a 43 Monk mowing guard after guard down, leaving the bodies strewn all OVER the place! I was
a young 9 druid at the time and didn't know anything and so I proceded to cast heal after (mostly) useless heal on him, 'til he sent
me a tell and told me to stop wasting my mana...lol

He told me that he was farming the guards as he could get a good price for the spears they dropped....As payment for all the heals
he gave me one. He had his bags full to the brim with 'em!..I sold it in RV for a little over 9pp, which was a big deal for me at
the time. Come to think of it it's still one of the better drops I've come across...
