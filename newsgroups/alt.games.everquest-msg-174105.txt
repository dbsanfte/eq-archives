hey all, need advice-my 13 dwf war just hit 13-now i have duel wield-i
am equally skilled in 1hslash and 2hd slash-i love my Glowing Vellium
Axe (2h, 37/18 +5 STA) but i was advised that i would deal more dam
over all if i go to duel wield (2 swd)- is that right?-if so, what
weop do u suggest for a poor war on a budget-not above 1 k for the
weopens-also do they both have to be swords?-i thought  a centi war
hammer witha cent short swd might be good-both kinda cheap-hammer has
nice dam-what u think?-stats for war are str-164, sta-111, agi-93,
dex, 92, wis 87, int 59, cha 45--  ac is 390, hp 480- moderate twink
with no great proc ect.-thanks for any help-Ironwolffe 13 war,
ironeyes 50 clr-rathe
