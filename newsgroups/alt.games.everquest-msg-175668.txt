No, illusions set your base race faction to that of the target.

Faction is made up of your base race and your religion, plus any faction
modifiers that you've accumulated.

Illusion resets your base race faction, but the religion and other modifiers
still apply.  It is possible to go from KOS to indifferent or even amiable,
just from an illusion spell.  I've done it.

It's also possible to have a faction that's so hosed that illusion won't fix
it.
