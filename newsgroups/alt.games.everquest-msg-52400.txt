Well, death does have a string in DAoC.  I am just as annoyed by a
death in DAoC as I am by a normal death in EQ (a death an EQ that
leads to a level loss is more annoying).

In fact, for a high level group in both games, DAoC has a *bigger* XP
loss on death on the EQ, because there is nothing like the EQ 49+ res.

Compare the penalties:

EQ: XP loss of about 12% of what you need for level (let's assume you
aren't right after a hell level).  Get 93% of that back with a 49+
res, or 96% back with a 56+ res.

DAoC: XP loss of about 5%.  Can't get this back.

EQ: return to bind point.  Can get ressed back to corpse for next
three hours.

DAoC: if you get res within N minutes (where N is your level), you
don't go to bind point.  Otherwise, you go to bind point *AND* lose
another 5% XP.  You can recover that XP back by running back to your
grave and praying.  Also, if you don't get ressed, your constitution
goes down by 3.  To get that back, you've got to pay an NPC healer.
Also, if you die on the way to pray at your grave, your new grave
replaces the old one, so the XP associated with the old one is lost.

EQ: cleric can bind near the place you are fighting.

DAoC: everyone has the same bind restrictions (usually cities and
towns, like EQ melee).

On the above three points, it looks to me like DAoC has the bigger
penalty, assuming a high level group that has classes with res.

Let's continue comparing.

EQ: you can lose a level due to the death XP loss.

DAoC: death XP loss is capped at how much XP you currently have in the
level, so you can't lose your level.

EQ: your equipment is on the corpse.

DAoC: no equipment on your gravestone.

On these two points, EQ has the bigger death penalty.
