Can't answer for the specific problem as to the training, but faction
work is easy in Shar Vahl. As another stated, the Vah Shir are
indifferent to others and faction are thus raised easily.

My Iksar Necro went from indifferent to amiable within a few levels,
so I gather a Barbarian Shaman should have no problems (...of course I
didnt have any issues with training :o)..).

Good hunting!
