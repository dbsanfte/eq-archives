Good point, maybe clerics -do- help groups move faster after
all.  I spent 95% of my cleric's life before Pacify actually was
worth casting, and even post fix, it hadn't really filtered in as
to how nicely the line could improve pulling, mostly clerics were
told to sit back down and med like good little healers.

I suppose Technically it is.  But to me, its HASTE.  Not "ooh, a
little more charisma, how sweet."  Or "mmm, HP, I like more HP". 
But rather "Boom, haste, we are now officially half again as good
as we were before; mobs die faster, we need less healing, zoom
zoom."

But if you grant them haste as a mere "buff" then I suppose they
have sort of a point.
