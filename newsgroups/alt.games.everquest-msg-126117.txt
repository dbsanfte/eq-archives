I saw him twice on E Marr the other day.  Killed him once with a necro 
I'd teamed up with, about an hour later I saw him again and due to the 
fact that he hit me *hard* the last time, we avoided him.  A few hours 
later someone else yelled he was up.  Had no idea he was a quest mob.  
Anyway, both times I saw him, we had zoned in on the wall side of Oasis, 
coming from N Ro, and he wandered over the dune in front and to the 
right of us, right in front of the zone line.
