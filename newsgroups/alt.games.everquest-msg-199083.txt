The sad fact is, that its not too clever an idea to buy a registered
set of EQ disks, I learnt this the hard way, when I was looking for
the velious expansion in the UK and bought a used gold pack from
Amazon, the discs all showed up, with box and even the manual, but I
was unable to access it all. because the Account no. and password were
not supplied, and I could not get hold of the seller.

Even if these were supplied, there are many people who buy accounts
only to have them removed from their custody by SOE, when the original
purchaser asks them to return his/her 'Hacked' account.

If you genuinely bought the game and wish to dispose of it in good
faith I suggest that you give it away to a friend/family member,
because I would NOT recommend anyone to purchase an account this way.
