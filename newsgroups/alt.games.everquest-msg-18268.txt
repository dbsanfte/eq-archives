What would be nice, and not unbalancing, would be to allow certain
spells to be cast from the book, with a longer casting time.  Make the
casting time equal to the regular spell casting time plus the
memorization time for that spell plus the memorization time for the
spell currently in slot 1.

The spells to allow this for would be the ones that are rarely or never
used in combat.  E.g., regular teleports, many buffs, summoning food and
drink, and stuff like that.
