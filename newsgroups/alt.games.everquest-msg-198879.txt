Items in a trade skill container don't vanish from LD.  They vanish from zone
or game crashes, or from someone taking them out.  Thats it.

Unless you are suggesting their's a bug that -is- somehow forcing items to
vanish when they aren't supposed to, that is.

I once left a smithing hammer, pattern, and materials in a forge in Shar Val
by mistake, went to buy water, went LD, came back the next morning (RL
morning, that is, over 8 RL hours elapsed time) and back to work, only to find
them all still there.  My conclusion is that neither LD nor time have anything
to do with stuff leaving a tradeskill container.

I could be wrong, but I've not heard any anecdotal evidence to the contrary,
and I've lost things from tradeskill containers very very rarely despite twice
daily use of this method since the bazaar went live (and frequent use for ages
before that)
