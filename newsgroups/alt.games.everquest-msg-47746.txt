You have generated quite a thread to state that perhaps VI is reacting based
on fear.  That seems to be your whole, and only, point.

Ok,  let's assume they are reacting out of fear...

So what?  I, for one, couldn't care less whether it is out of fear or a
desire for a better product.  I will play it until I don't want to play it
any more and I will enjoy improvements and criticize what I feel are not
improvements.  Looks like business as usual to me.
