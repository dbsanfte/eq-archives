Hoping to get some help with the following problem:

When I switch to stereo 3d mode in EverQuest, the landscape switches
to stereo, but not the people/monsters.

Has anyone else encountered this problem?

I'm using an ASUS agp-v7700 deluxe (32Mb) with the Nvidia drivers
(tried both v23.11 and v28.32) and Nvidia stereo drivers (v23.11 only,
I'm skeptical about downloading drivers that aren't posted on Nvidia's
website.) I've also tried Ctrl-F9 ingame but didn't notice any
difference.
