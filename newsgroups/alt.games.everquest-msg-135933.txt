Lance, although you've said this many times the repetition does
not make it any easier to believe.  While I suppose that it's
possible that you grouped with "many paladins" who habitually
equipped (really) crappy weapons, your claim resembles the
warriors who have claimed to outdamage monks and/or rogues based
solely on parsing their own log files.  You have stated that you
base your claim on hand parsed data from your logs, did you ever
have these paladins extract the damage data from their logs?  You
do not get all of the melee messages generated by _other_ players
in _your_ log.  If you want an accurate comparison between the
damage done by two characters in the same fight you need the data
from both logs.  Even before the first two-handed weapon patch
(over two years ago now? somebody correct if that's wrong) a L40
paladin would have gotten 5 bonus damage per hit and his damage
was determined using a better "damage table".  There would have
had to be a _very_ large difference in weapon quality to allow you
to achieve parity, let alone superiority.
