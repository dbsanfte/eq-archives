I haven't done extensive testing, but as far as I can see, OOC regen 
overwrites your normal regen rate, and locks you in at a set percentage 
of your mana and HP bars per tic, no matter what gear and buffs you are 
wearing.  The only exception to this is Canni type effects; burst mana 
from canni or mod rods or necro feeds etc.

After a fight, you get at least 30 seconds of non OOC regen, more if you 
have any sort of DOT/Debuff on you; it should be easy enough to test 
this by watching your mana recovery during non OOC versus OOC, with mana 
numbers visible on your inventory screen you can see exactly whats going on.

Clarity from potions is the same as clarity from buffs, it has never 
stacked with necro/SK lich line spells.  I don't know about which spell 
overwrites which, although at 70 C6 doesn't overwrite my SK's Pact of 
Decay, even though its more mana, has an int and mana pool bonus built 
in, and has a longer duration.

I've never tried drinking a C potion while in Pact form, though, first 
because I rarely drink potions given that Pact would be more mana per 
tic and second because I'd assumed the potion would bounce, so I click 
off Pact first.

I'm glad regular C line doesn't overwrite my pact, because if I have 
pact up while in the presence of an enchanter, its because I need to be 
in skeleton form, probably because there is a ledge somewhere I'll be 
unable to climb up while gnome sized.
