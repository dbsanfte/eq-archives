Since we're onto a new subject I will address this.

Try to keep name-calling out of it, k??  You can call my post idiotic,
etc etc, but you don't have to stoop to calling me an idiot or
illiterate.  You know nothing about me whatsoever, that would allow
you to make such a determination.

Now, to your post...

Don't get me wrong, I am ALL for an Anti-Discrimination law.

But how about a law that simply prohibits Discrimination.  Period.

If someone is discriminated against, for WHATEVER reason, it would be
against the law.

I don't feel it should be ignored. 

But it SHOULD be addressed, investigated and prosecuted EVENLY, FAIRLY
and without (watch this!  :^)   )  WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION...

That's right..  A Discrimination Law should be applied WITHOUT
DISCRIMINATION...
