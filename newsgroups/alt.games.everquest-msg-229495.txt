It's quick to get the the Butcherblock wayfarer's camp too... hit the
felwithe book and it's a short run to zone into BB - the WF camp is right
near zone.

level 20 is the min level to do LDoN.

the Mistmoore catacombs adventures are considered the easiest.  Go to the
wayfarer's camp in butcherblock with your lower lev char... there are
usually groups to be found from 20 to 65 there.  For the most part, all
other camps are only reliable for pickup groups in the 60's.

adventure xp is great in the 20's .  with a lvl 24 char, I think I got
almost a whole level per adventure (is very easy to clear the dungeon).  The
adventures are basically a joke at low levels.
