I would not even try Veksar until you are 50.  The Aqua goblins at the
entrance are easy for a high 40s group but the mobs get progressively harder
as you move inside.  Currently, the guild I am in is trying to farm the soul
scream belts from the rotting shop keepers.  I think a good group for this
zone is to have your main tank be atleast 55 and have a couple back up
melees who are atleast 52.  Bring a Shaman along that is high enough to slow
the mobs inside.  Have one of your additonal melees be a monk.  Pulling the
mobs inside can be very tricky.  Everything in this place seems to be undead
so Paladins, Shadow Knights and Necro Mancers should be good additions to
any group here.  A nuker in your group is a nice additon but the mobs hit
hard enough to waste him or her very qucikly if they steal agro from the
main tank.  I was in a group as a 52 warror with a 55 monk, 54 ranger, 63
Necro, 62 Druid and 51 Ranger.  We did very well until we reached the
courtyard with all of the Golems.  We cleared a path and was near the
shopkeeper's spawn point when a Golem respawned during a pull.  It agroed
the Necro and the necro died in less than 15 seconds.  This even happend
with a Spetre pet at his side.  Then, when we tried our hand with a Behemoth
the two rangers got wasted and the Druid drew agro.  He died and all that
was left was the Monk and Myself.  There is a bug in the corner of this area
and if you get too close to the wall you can fall down to the entrance.  I
fell, was unsure about what happened, then got summoned back only to find an
additional golem attacking the monk.  I died and the monk FD.

Once you get past the small hallway inside that you have to swim through,
things get very tough.  But the loot is also very good.

All the times I have been I cannot remember anyone shouting LFG.  We went
last friday night and we were the only ones there.  Then after about an hour
more groups were showing up.

Make sure you have someone who can slow the mobs.  The mobs hit very fast
and very hard.
