Forget Luclin, that machine won't run it acceptably.  Velious should be fine
though.

seriously though, it wouldn't be a good investment in a video card for that
machine.  if you have something that runs EQ now, then don't bother putting
money into it.

I say upgrade the power supply in that because the newer cards require more
juice.  so even if you DO throw a new video card in, I would still recommend
you add another 50 watts and get a 300watt power supply.  maybe a GeForce 3
Ti500 would work in there, but anything more and it'd be a waste cause the
processor would be choking.
