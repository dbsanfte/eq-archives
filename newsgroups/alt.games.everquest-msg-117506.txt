This is exactly the reason I would like to have more than one character on the
role play server.  To me the game is not about leveling.. it is about advancing
my own mind and knowledge.  
I *am* a ranger.  I run unnoticed through the trees.  I am also primary puller
in battle.  It is my role in this life and I love it.
I would also love to *sit on my butt*, contemplating the universe and assisting
my group with heals and buffs.  But, in the real world, I can't have both.
