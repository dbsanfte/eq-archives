Fine. Drama it was, then. Thanks for clarifying.

They don't *have* to do it differently. Anyone with any sense at all 
realizes that system outages do occur - sometimes severe. This is not a 
regular occurrance by any means. You're treating it like it is.

Actually, it would be quite relevant, as a more reliable service level 
would support the idea that you do in fact "get what you pay for". 

Now, if your argument is more that it should not be that way and that 
SoE should be legally forced to provide better service, then I must 
disagree even more strongly. The last thing I want is for the courts to 
decide how much bang I should be getting for my entertainment buck.
