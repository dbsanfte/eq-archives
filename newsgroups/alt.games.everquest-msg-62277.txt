Tradeskills are mostly just for fun, you know.

Patchwork a waste of time? You don't need to waste a silk cord on it,
you don't need a main inventory slot to hold it, you can make it from
all three main pelt types, and it *does* sell back to vendors for a
(minor) profit.
You'll sometimes see newbies auction to buy the low end armors, but
you're correct in that nobody bothers actively selling it to players
nowadays. You shouldn't worry about selling anything till you can make
cured silk and backpacks, and with Wu's armor and the many master
tailors there are now, even cured silk is doubtful (I never sold any
to players)
