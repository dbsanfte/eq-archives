*coughBULLSHITcough*

You know why I'm sure?  Because a _real_ 13 year-old would know that
buying 40 hours of one person's game time would have precisely ZERO
chance of getting you a CoF, Cobalt BP or Cobalt Greaves, and only a
tiny possibility for a Cobalt Bracer.

A 13 year-old would have enough experience in the game to know that
400 bucks might get you one or two of the items you seek, but by no
means the whole set, with plat to boot!

Finally, a 13 year-old would know that Cobalt is yesterday's news and
would almost certainly be after Warlord items for multiquesting.

No, you're just a pathetic guy who wanted to bypass the tedious stuff
like actually learning about the game, thought he'd have people lining
up to make real money from the game, got cornholed most magnificently
in Grand Usenet Style, lost an email account, got worried about losing
the cable-ISP account, panicked, and fell back on the old 'my hamster
did it, not me!' ploy.

And now, despite your denials, you are still reading the newsgroup to
see if we were fooled.

You are in dire need of a visit from the Clue-Fairy.
