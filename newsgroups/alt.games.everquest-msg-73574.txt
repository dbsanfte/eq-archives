First off let me say that you must have REALLY to have had to deal
with a LOT of asses in your time to have made the following
statements.  :-)

No, I accept that if i dont get a bind someplace closer (say FM in the
OT/RV example) I will likely have to make a very long corpse run if I
die.  If that is the case I have already made the decision to accept
my fate.

For me this isnt the case at all.  Not getting bound closer is simply
a matter of not being concerned about the consequences of my death.
If that means a long corpse run (took me 2 hours to get from RV to OT
and back once when I died on my way to wait for Da Bloated Belly) then
so be it. 

If I have a Cleric in the group it doesnt really matter where I am
bound as they usually want to Rez me anyways as I am usually at least
one zone away.   Depending on the Cleric level they often want to rez
me even if I am IN the zone which I dont do.  If I die, I die.  I lose
a little XP, no big deal.

If I die (like the time I mentioned en route to the boat) I simply
start looking to see if there are any Clerics in the zone.

Nope, not me.  I will simply send a polite message to the effect of
"Hi there.  I hope you will forgive the intrusion and I fully
understand that you are likely too busy to help but if you arent,
could you possibly help me with a Revive?  I would be happy to donate
but surely understand if you are unavailable and if that is the case,
I apologize for interruping you. =)"

If they are OK with it I ask them for nothing more than a Revive as my
death needs to pay the cost of experience lost, but I understand if
they have a different Rez spell memmed and dont want to re-mem it.

If they state that they are busy, I simply apologize again for
interrupting them and either try someone else or simply start hoofing
it to the dock.

If I am within running distance (IE not in RV while dead in OT) I will
always make the run.

>Your poor planning does not constitute an emergency on my part, sorry.
>Good luck with the CR." /ignore

Boy, you need to be just a LITTLE more uptight my friend.  When I die
in some far away land it is NOT due to poor planning on my part, but
rather on a decision to accept that IF I die I am in for a tough trek
back to retrieve my corpse.

Dont get me wrong, I understand that you do get those who act as you
have stated, much as I get the "Can you give me a weapon?  Shield?
Armor?  Money?  Come on, you have lots and I dont have anything!!  I
am poor and you are rich.  You are just being greedy!  You are selling
things for 10k and you cant even spare 50 lousy plat?  You are an
ass!"

>It's positively amazing the number of people who will get downright abusive
>when you are unable to assist them.

Or simply choose NOT to assist them for whatever reason.  If I am
looking for a port or a rez or SoW or whatever and someone says they
are busy, I leave it at that and apologize for interrupting them.  If
they tell me they are busy, it doesnt matter WHAT they are doing or
WHY they are busy, they simply are.... leave them alone.

And it is even MORE amazing to me how many people will get downright
abusive PERIOD=)

Keep in mind as well that another reason many of us choose to NOT bind
everywhere we go is that it can make getting BACK to where we want to
be after adventuring MUCH easier.  If you are a Caster it may mean you
can simply GATE back.  If not, you may have situations like I did.  

For the longest time my EQ GF was fighting in Kunark, LOIO and FM
mostly, like for 3 months or so (she doesnt play much) so I would stay
bound in FV most times and if on a certain night she was able to play,
I could sit in EC until she got on and then simply look for someone
willing to TL me to my Bind Point and be there in 5-10 minutes rather
than having to TP or take the boat to BB and wait on the shuttles for
30 minutes if I missed them.

While I appeciate what you are saying, narrow the brush stroke a bit.
Not all of us are what you are experiencing.
