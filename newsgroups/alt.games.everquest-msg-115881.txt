Sitting is the key there.  My guess is that something aggro'd on you, your
pet did it's duty and dispatched of the creature.  While the critter was
running from your pet, something else jumped in on it.  When you are
sitting things will jump on your pet even if they would normally leave you
alone.  Things that are KoS to you that is (read as greenies).  Good way
to get faction up also.  I parked my pet in the king room in the Warrens
and gated back to the zone entrance.  Sit down and read a book while
the faction rolls in (34th necro pet).
