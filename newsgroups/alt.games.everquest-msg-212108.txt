No, you are just clueless.  A slowed mob in PoP, not PoN, the planes with 
mobs that hit really hard, can hit for amazing amounts of damage.  It is 
always preferable to have the mobs slowed as early as possible.  This is 
why you will find that people prefer a knight class as the damage sponge.  
When I fight with a warrior as the sponge, I wait to slow, he takes a lot 
more damage than the knight would, and eventually, when he finally has 
enough aggro, I slow.  The tanks I regularly fight with who are far from 
uber, generally have upwards of 6k hp, with group buffs, whether warrior 
or knight class, and AC well over 1200 unbuffed.

Again, Mr. clueless, the knight is not pulling the mob off me, the mob 
never gets on me because there is a knight there.  When there is a 
warrior there, I don't generally get agro either, I just wait and let the 
mob beat on him for a bit first.  Cleric uses more mana healing the 
warrior, and, at times me, as the warrior has not yet managed to grab 
enough agro.

I see that you managed to not comment on the "recharge" time your groups 
require.
