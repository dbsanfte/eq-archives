Well, maybe it's' hard to die swimming down the tube, but when you drop 
through the floor trap into the basement and then try to swim up the tube, 
you can die, or so the pile of corpses would indicate.  If it's the same 
tube I'm thinking of, aren't the spinning black things only at the very 
top, on the main level?

Yeah, Chardok Queen was the one that popped to mind, but there are other 
mobs like this.  Probably not enough to keep the Pallys happy, but they're 
the grin and bear it types anyway.

I honestly don't know how we posistion Velk, since I have problems with 
lag on Velk fights, so I'm always staring at my shoes until assist is 
called, then I'm staring at Velk's shoes.

Hmmm, that's actually a good idea, though our chanters are pretty good 
about staying alive when tashing.  At least they don't die nearly as much 
as they used to.  That being said, our most active chanter does fight to 
take the DT in PoA quite often.  Of course she's been 60 forever, and we 
haven't been back to PoA since AA points, so maybe it's different now.
