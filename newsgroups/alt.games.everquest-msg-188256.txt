My beastlord Im sad to say has got rather atrocious weapon skills. No, she's
not been powerlevelled at all, its just that she seems to level SO fast that
its nigh on impossible to keep all her weapon skills maxxed for her level.
In perusing this ng I saw mention of using a high level pet to skillup a
persons skills by /duelling. My main, a 55 Druid,  just got Booboo, and he
would still be quite red to my beastlord. If I took them to some secluded
area and /duelled would my baby beastlord be able to eventually max out her
weapon skills by melee'ing my druids pet ? If so I may have to invset some
time to do this......

Any input you can provide is, as always, greatly appreciated.
