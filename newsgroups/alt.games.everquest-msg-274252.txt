Because it doesn't change anything. They can kick you out because they
don't like the way you parted your hair today and, if they didn't bill
you afterwards, you'd have no recourse. They are not obligated to
allow anyone on their property that they don't want there. Everyone's
so obsessed with their own rights, what about the rights of a property
owner to control access to their property?
