This is another great site for information.  This is the newbie guide, but
there is a lot of other very helpful info and links on this site.  There is
also a reasonably priced book out that is a great reference, because it has
all the city maps and a variety of class and race info all together in one
spot.

However, since you are a jump-in type, I would recommend just playing.  That
is the quickest way to learn and you will be surprised how fast you will
pick up the game.  The first newbie I ever helped had only played the game
one day.  Two weeks later he was 11th level.

Good Luck
