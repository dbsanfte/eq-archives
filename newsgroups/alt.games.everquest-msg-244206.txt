Proper syntax is a strict requirement in any programming language. You 
can't compile a C++ app with a single "}" missing... this is a good 
thing. Its easy enough to write bug free software... the last thing we 
need is a compiler that starts guessing what we intended to do.

Ideally if the page isn't HTML complient the browser should toss up an 
error message, and render nothing. The web page author will quickly fix 
the offending bugs if he wants his page viewed and the browers can be 
small and efficient...

For some reason (mostly marketing/competition related) HTML went the 
other way... you can write anything, and IE will do its best to figure 
something out. The problem with this is multiple:

1) that it forces *all browsers* to bloat and perform guesswork on 
pages. If IE can render some random html junk then "my browser has to 
also" or IE will be a better browser from the end users perspective 
because it renders more pages.

2) Worse, my compatibility code has to mimic IEs because if junk html 
looks good in IE (which is what it was probably tested with) then if it 
doesn't look good in my browser its because my browser guessed how to 
interpret the junk html differently. This gave microsoft and advantage, 
forcing everyone to keep up with them... lately their browser 
marketshare is eroding... but they are still the dominant player by 
default and will be for years to come.

3) Millions of malformed HTML pages float around the web and work just 
fine in the bloated compatibility modes of the various mainstream 
browsers... but as soon as someone tries to write a browser from 
scratch, stright from the HTML spec they find it doesn't work 
adequately...there is simply too much junk html on the web. This a 
serious problem when the browser can't afford to be bloated and slow 
(e.g. PalmOS browsers and other embedded systems like cellphones.

Nobody is expected to write 100% syntactically correct html. There are 
web pages you can submit your page to that mechanically check it and 
point out any errors.

Writing good html is actually very easy. Most violations that would 
appear in a page that a novice would write are simply typos, improper 
nesting, and orphan tags... all easily correctible even by that novice, 
provided that they are told where to look.

You have to get into pretty exotic stuff before fixxing a page for 
compliance gets 'hard'.
