Sometimes that's what it takes. There are people who think liberty is
worth fighting, and dying, for. Ever hear the quote "Give me liberty,

England.

Oh, wait, we don't.

Note 1 - sometimes you don't need to battle an entire government or
its armies to overthrow it.

Note 2 - the ability to overthrow a government isn't the only reason
for wanting to preserve one's right to have a weapon.
