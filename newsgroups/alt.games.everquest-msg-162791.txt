Getting burned out on my Warrior I have started playing my Mage again.  I
have a few questions that I have not found the answers for.

1. Are pet naturally able to breath underwater?
2. Are normal land based mobs able to breath underwater?  I ask this since I
just got my Summon Waterstone spell that lets me have enduring breath.  I
thought it would be cool if I could plant myself at the bottom of some
water, pull a mob into the water and then have my Earth pet root it there
while I nuke it.
3. Can elemental pets wear armor?  I have read that some say yes they can
while others say they cannot.  I would love to know if they indeed can.
4. Finally, can some pets bash with a shield while using a weapon in the
other hand or are they all unable to?  I read a post from somone awhile back
that said he summoned a shield and gave it to his pet and then a fang for
the pet to use as a weapon.  Then he went on to say that the pet would hit
with the fang and then bash for another 10-15 points of damage with the
shield.  I tried this myself without any luck with a level 16th level Earth
Pet.

Thanks for any replys in advance.
