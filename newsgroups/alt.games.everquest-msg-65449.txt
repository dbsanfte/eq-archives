Ah, so I might have to change the BIOS settings if I try the PCI card,
eh? This particular point is an excellent one that I would like to make
to everyone who keeps saying, "Jazz, buddy, you should just build your
own machine! It's cheaper and it's *SO* easy!"  That's something that a
lot of you probably just take for granted and assume I will too.
Hardware incompatibility problem on the new system you're building? No
worries! Just adjust the BIOS!

Here's what I know about BIOS:  They're short pieces published about
people that give a thumbnail history of their lives and/or careers.
Oh... you mean that Computer BIOS thingie? Isn't it the piece of metal
with all that fins on it that fits over the processor?

No, seriously. I seem to recall reading that BIOS is some underlying set
of instructions, well below the level of the OS, that define the system
and how the various hardware components work together, or something like
that. But I wouldn't have a clue how to change the BIOS settings. So,
since I pretty much decided I'm going to run out and grab the PCI video
card, let's err on the safe side and assume that when I uninstall my
drivers, shut down, remove the AGP card, install the PCI card and a disk
with the new drivers, the machine lights up, looks at me, and says,
"Hey, dickhead! Hello! I dont' have a fucking video card. What exactly
were you expecting me to do?"

What do I do then? I've experimented enough with this bastard now to be
able to assume this is what's going to happen tonight, so is this a fast
fix? How do I access this BIOS and what do I do to "adjust" it so it
will let my new video card in the PCI slot "do the driving"?
