While the pace of fights is not the only possible stupid and careless thing,
keeping the pace too fast is nonetheless stupid and careless, pretty much by
definition.  Keeping it fast but not too fast, thats different.  But "too" fast...

If 20% mana is good, 100% mana is just as good, we'll go down to 80% instead of
down to OOM.  And if you were wrong and that pull actually required 21% mana, we'd
be alive with 1% left, instead of dead and feeling stupid.  But of course you
wont' be dead anyway because you are a monk, and we won't be feeling stupid
because we Told you not to pull... we'll be dead and feeling that you are stupid.

The mistake in question is the monk's, not the healers', and yet its the monk that
is living dangerously and the healers (and tanks) that are at risk.

Pacify is a single target spell, and pulling using it requires that either your
cleric or chanter stop medding and go pull.  And if it happens to fail, all the
mobs come along for the fun of it;  a monk could FD that error away, but not the
cleric or chanter.  There are circumstances where pacify pull is indeed ideal, but
likewise monk pulls are situationally the best in the game, same for bards,
SK/Necros, ranger/druids, heck, I've been in many a group where my mage was the
best option for puller.

First thing you got right.  But people group because teams are more effective and
more fun than soloing; and a lot of people -don't- group because other people fail
to understand that its a team effort, there's no I in "LOM hold pulls".  You can
discuss your theory of why you should be pulling more often and what can be done
about it, but in the end there should be a consensus reached, not a unilateral
decision by the puller, particularly not a puller who is less likely to suffer
from the mistake; that means its not his risk so it shouldn't be his call to make.
