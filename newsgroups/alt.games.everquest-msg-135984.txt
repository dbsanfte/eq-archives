I heard others commenting that they could no longer see themself in the 
inventory screen also. My question was just "You could see yourself 
before?". I've never been able to see myself in there, so I didn't know 
quite what they were talking about. That being said, I don't miss it :)

I got a new inventory XML file anyhow that greatly reduces the space it 
uses, the new UI's inventory seems to have a lot of extra space that isn't 
necessary.
