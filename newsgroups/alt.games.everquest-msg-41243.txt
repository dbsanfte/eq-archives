Take the path up the river to Lake of Ill Omen, run across LOIO to Frontier
Mountains, run across FM to The Overthere, run across OT through the Evil
Outpost and get on the boat there, get off the boat at the Timorous Deep
ogre docks, wait for the raft to take you to Oasis, make your way to the
Commonlands...

Oh you wanted the easy route? *grin*
