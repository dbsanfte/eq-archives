I, the original poster, have a similar situation.  I'm the lead (only) IT
support person at a technology company and I'm freelance.  So some days I
just stay home, since I'm not always 'working' if I'm at work.  (I can go to
work and play Everquest no problem - but I won't get paid..  I also won't
get paid if I'm there and not doing anything)....

I'm currently trying that EQW thing, but it lookss busted.
