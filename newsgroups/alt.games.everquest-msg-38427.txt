Hi,

I am doing the BoneThunder Quest , and part of it is to find Drosco in the
Qeynos Catacombs and give him a note to get the Bayle List.

I have gone to the spot he is supposed to pop, and found "a gelatonous cube"
over and over and over again.

I had someone try tracking him and sure enough he wasn;t up.  I continuously
killed the cubes, but after 8 kills, he still has yet to pop.   Does anyone
know if there is something i can do to get him to pop, or is it just a put
in the time and eventually he will come out.  Otherwise, how the hell can i
continue the quest without him?

Thanks
Dave
