Haha, I just really like how much sense that makes.

Say you are an evil monster, OK, and you are fighting this kung fu hero from
parts unknown.

All the sudden he goes down! Yes, you win! You still hate him, of course. So
you start to walk away to tell everyone about your success, when he gets
back up!

Oh, but then he dies again! Must be some crazy after death twitch they're
always talking about. Time to walk off. Well, you sure don't hate him as
much now! Oh, but he gets back up!

Oh, then he dies again. Well, now you just don't hate him at all! After
dying and getting back up a few times, it's time to just forget about it
altogether!

I mean, what, do these mobs have the attention span of a goldfish, or what.
