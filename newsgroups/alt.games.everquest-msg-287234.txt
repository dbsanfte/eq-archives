MI5 Persecution Update: Friday 31. March, 2000

22,544 Faxes Delivered. in Three Years, and Still No Breakthrough

In the last three years. I have sent at least 22,544 faxes to recipients in
the UK,. of which at least 13,974 have gone to Westminster. Last weekend
alone. I sent 832 completed faxes to politicians, the media and various
others, on the subject of MI5s mistreatment of. me these last ten years.

I believe some. of the recipients know of MI5s actions against me in the
last decade; yet they maintain strict "omerta". in fear of the security
services persecution actions being made. public.

MI5 Insist that these. Faxes must Continue

Between September 1999 and mid-January 2000,. the persecutors, whoever they
might be,. mostly left me alone. I counted only three incidents in almost
five months - which is. a lower rate than at any time since June 1990, when
this business. started.

By leaving me alone for several months,. the "oppressors" were making an
implicit assurance. that they would continue to leave me alone in the
future. On 11 January I posted to an internet newsgroup accepting. what I
saw as their. assurance of no further harassment, stating that I would
cease sending. these faxes - which is the only thing I do in my defence -
if they continued. to leave me alone. And for two weeks I did indeed
refrain from distributing. these articles.

But MI5 acted in. bad faith. From the last week of January until the
beginning of March, they resumed. their hate campaign against me with a
vengeance. They even put people in. my road three times in February, one
instance of which I recorded.. They resumed their normal behaviour of
bugging my phone and house, listening to where I would go, and. then
placing people in that location to "aggravate. and annoy" me.

What MI5 did in February is plainly a contravention of. the Protection from
Harassment Act 1997,. since it has caused me "alarm and distress" as
specified in the Act. But it is a waste of time going. to the police with a
complaint, since. the police have done, and will do, absolutely nothing. I
complained to. the Metropolitan Police in 1995, and they refused to take my
complaint. When I. complained again in 1999, the detective sergeant laughed
at my complaint, with the words, "It's an. absolute load of rubbish. I
don't investigate rubbish. I can't. be more blunt or to the point than
that." It is useful to remember that the. Met also treated Stephen
Lawrences parents with. similar discourtesy; police prejudices are similar
in my case, so I can take some comfort from that. case and hope that one
day. I will get a fair hearing.

MI5 acted in bad faith, but they. also acted with arrogance. They do not
care if I send 800 faxes every weekend, since they know. I cannot prove my
claims, and. the recent Shayler case shows how weak external oversight is
of the secret services. But they acted with more than arrogance - the. MI5
agents actually want my. faxes to continue, they insist that these faxes
continue,. since my communications give them an excuse to continue their
activities, and continue in the. paid employ of the secret service. Despite
their. use of diverse proxies over the last ten years, it is the same MI5
officers behind the campaign. all the time - I have seen one of them on
three occasions in Canada over a period of years, and it. is a safe belief
that that same. person continues to be paid for his "work" in harassing me
in London now. The average cost of an MI5 employee. is some 75,000 per
annum, so one may infer that their officers are amply. compensated; their
insistence that "hostilities". are maintained is understandable when placed
in this. light.
