A bit two faced of them don't you think? And what about those I saw here who
said that names like these destroy their enjoyment of the game? What? Do
they just never go down into that zone then? Awfully hypocritical to make
players abide by one set of rules and the game by another when it comes to
names that "ruin" the fun of the game. I personally don't care, but it
obviously means a lot to some of the people in this group.
