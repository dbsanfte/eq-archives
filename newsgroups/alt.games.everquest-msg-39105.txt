2 accounts is extreme powergamer?
You must be kidding....

Either that or you're really not paying attention to the folks around
you.  The real farmers have multiple accounts and multiple systems.

2 is nothing.

cleared the fire giants "solo" using those four characters.  *THAT* is
my definition of extreme powergamer.
