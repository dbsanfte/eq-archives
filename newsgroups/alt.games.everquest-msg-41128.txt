You should follow the news more closely...and just imagine how most
governments are handling terrorism right now...including individuals who
condone what happened over the internet...

Seems you're not as bright as you convey...but seriously..keep posting this
tripe and cross your fingers that your government sees this as just some
moron trying to get a rise out of people instead of someone that needs to be
detained because of the serious nature of their comments...

You DO realize that internet newsgroups are monitored by your local
government correct? As well as ours of course...

By all means...keep posting you coward...still waiting for that email with
your personal info including name and address...

Oh that's right...that would mean you would have to stand up for your views
instead of hiding behind a keyboard to convey them...

I sure hope your mommy doesn't catch you typing this crap...she'll ground
your ass forever...
