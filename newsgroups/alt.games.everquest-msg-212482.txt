Heh, no, I wouldn't be surprised.  :)  I've done decades of debugging
and I'm familiar with how debuggers often change the environment in
which the program is running.  However, that isn't always the case.

From the point of view of the code itself, it doesn't necessarily
know it's being slowed down.  It depends on how 'capable' the code
is.  If the 'code' can query the system timer, sure, it can determine
that lots of time has passed from instruction A to instruction B.
However, there are plenty of bytecode and scripting languages that
are severely limited, and have no idea when they're being debugged.
Along with that, there are debuggers that don't change the environment
at all.
