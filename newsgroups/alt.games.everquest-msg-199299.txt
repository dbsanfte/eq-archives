Well, since that seems to be the consensus...binding CLOSE to the fight, 
but NOT where the train(s) may go.   Maybe even just across the zone 
line.

But, to be sure on this, Level 18 Wizards get Lesser Evacuate.  Is this 
in the Succor line? (As oppossed to Gate)

Still learning the wizard ways, and trying to remember that a level 15 
Wizard has NO business trying to be the tank of a group ;)

All in all, thanks for  the info everyone.
