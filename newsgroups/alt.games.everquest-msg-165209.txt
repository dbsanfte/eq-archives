Cartesian axis are <x, y, z>, for some reason EQ uses <y, x, z>.

When you are looking at a map (www.eqatlas.com), and looking at the /loc
results, use the "first" coordiante to find North/South location, then
"second" coordinate to find East/West coordinate.  The third is pretty much
usless.

The trickiest part for me is determining which direction I am facing to
start moving!  Sense heading is nice (never bothered to train it), but I
often move a little, then do /loc, move a little and do /loc.

From the change in coordinates you can roughly determine what direction you
are moving in (more north/south, and/or more east/west).

Needless to say, non-visual navigation is challanging in EQ!
