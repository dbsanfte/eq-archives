AH, ok....hmm I have multiple machines on 98 with 512, 640 and 768 meg and
have not seen this problem...so, ok....I also always set machines as Network
Server instead of Desktop PC, I understood this changes something cache
wise? maybe that's why i haven't seen this problem??

Sounds like a good thing, then....
