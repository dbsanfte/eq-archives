You might want to check that in-game.  I was looking at Tantor's Tusk
in the bazaar just the other day and I'm pretty certain it is 2HP.
I've found the various gear search websites to be routinely inaccurate
about 50+ content, if I haven't seen it in-game I take any claim with
a boulder of salt.

Very nice.  It's also NODROP, and it's the rare drop off an NToV
dragon.  How many of these are in the hands of Paladins who are
<not> in Tier I guilds?  Maybe 3 across all the servers?  But I'll
grant you that it <is> an interesting Paladin usable piercer.  :)
