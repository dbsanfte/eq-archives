Also speaking as a cleric on Drinal, lemme give you some advice.  =)

First SCM3.  Do it.  Get it.  Before anything.  Hands-down the most useful
cleric AA.  It saves you mana on *every* spell, including Complete Healing.
It will make a big difference.

MGB is just about a prerequisite.  Useful as a way to buff your entire raid,
and also useful as a way to cast an Area of Effect heal as you MGB Ethereal
Elixir or Celestial Regeneration (see below).  Those will both come in handy
as you progress through the Planes of Power.

Divine Arbitration 3 is also extremely useful.  Great for those cases when
the chanter drops suddenly to 20% health and you've got the tank targeted.
Has many other uses as well, like being able to heal your party in a raid
while still keeping the Main Tank targeted while you're in a Complete Heal
Chain.

Celestial Regeneration is also very very useful.  Manaless group heal over
time - who could ask for anything more?  CR requires Healing Gift 3 first,
which is useful itself - it's nice when your fast heal can act as a
near-complete heal on a crit.  A useful combo is to DivArb your group during
an emergency, followed by CR - and just like that, you've managed to heal
everyone to full without using any mana at all.

Radiant Cure is also very handy - group cure to get rid of those nasty
detrimental buffs.  I've managed to survive so far with just RC1, although I
do eventually plan to get RC3.

If you're going to be a cleric in a raiding guild, then Unfailing Divinity 3
is going to be a must.  This makes Divine Intervention go off just about
every time it can.  This supposes that you have the spell Divine
Intervention and that you cast it on your Main Tank before any major battle,
both of which I would highly recommend.

After that, you can start moving into other paths, getting the AA's you
want.  SCR and SCRM are handy AA's.  Healing Adept is also something that
will make all of your heals more effective.  There's also AHA and AHG, which
makes both of those AA's even more effective.  Combat Agility followed by
Lightning Reflexes is also extremely useful - helps you avoid damage when
you get healing aggro and the mob starts to beat on you.  Natural Durability
helps, too - the more hitpoints you have, the better.

AA's to avoid:  Turn Undead.  Totally useless.  Mental Clarity - you can
dump a lot of AA's to get a whopping three extra mana per tick; the
trade-off isn't worth it until you have AA's to waste.  Maybe MC1 is all
right - 2 AA's for one extra mana tick.  But four AA's for MC2 and six more
for MC3 - fuggetaboutit.  Purify Soul - while it's absolutely guaranteed to
remove just about every detrimental effect you can possibly have, it's
single target with a long reuse; again, your AA's are better spent
elsewhere.  Avoid Planar Power and Innate Enlightenment, too, until you have
AA to burn - the tradeoff isn't worth it.

That's just my advice; others will different opinions, of course.  A good
resource is the EQ cleric boards at:

Good luck!  Feel free to shoot me an in-game tell if you have questions.
