i used to play EQ a while ago and back then, everyone and their
grandmother was auctioning off all their excess items on ebay, but
apparently not anymore.
i'm assuming that there is still a secondary market for items, where
are people doing this now? i'm curious to see what stuff is going for
these days compared to 12+ months ago when i stopped playing.
