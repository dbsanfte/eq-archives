It's more difficult, but not impossible.  The agro radius around the
NPCs near the Epic NPC you want is pretty much point blank.  It's easy
to avoid them with invis.  The bigger threat to my Dark Elf wizard
friend was the roaming guards.  I and a shaman guildie had lookout 
duty while he was turning things in.

More to the Wizard Epic than the mana regen.  It's also a 796 hit
point rune.  A wizard with the Epic effect can survive a few
more rounds of combat until someone else gets the mob off of them.

Don't forget Dead Man Floating.  It's a good idea to include at least
one necro in the raid if you're fighting a poisoning dragon like
Trakanon or Severilous.  Part of the DMF spell is a poison-resist
buff that stacks with other PR buffs.

> Tracking: 0

Sense the Dead can point a necro in the direction of the nearest
undead mob.

> Hostile Territory Travel: 6, invis, IVU, and feign death

Dead Man Floating here, too.  Makes moving over water and
steep areas quicker and less painful.  DMF also has an
underwater breathing component.

Divine Aura's saved my young cleric more than once.  :)

Might not Mark of Karn or the Dispel line count?  Someone with
a cleric higher than 25, could you weigh in?  :)

> Tracking: 0

Sense the Dead and Sense Summoned can point a cleric in the direction 
of the nearest mob of these types.

There are a few disciplines which can reduce damage being taken for
a short time.

> Mob Debuffing: 0

Mighty Strike is a useful discipline when fighting something like
Venril Sathir.  It can stun a mob for a brief period of time.

What about Mend?

That's an understatement.  I know of one guild that did all the 
major Epic fights in one Saturday.

And Harm Touch-- especially when boosted by their level 55 discipline.

> Healing: 0

If they've got an Epic and it's proccing consistantly, they can heal
back a lot of the damage they take-- provided the mob is not hitting
for insane amounts.  I've seen this first-hand with my SK hunting
partner.

If they don't learn how to manage their agro, yes.

/agree

Made my life easier when I got the first one.

> Healing: 4, limited to greater heal, but better than nothing

We also get Chloroplast at level 55.

> Mob Debuffing: 3

I'd argue higher because of Snare/Ensnare.  There's more than
one way to slow a mob down.  More so if the ranger has both Epics.
Earthcaller procs a 50% slow and 500 point DOT.  Very useful if
you don't have a slower or your slower can't land the slow.

> Downtime Reduction: 0

> Epic Power: 8, ranger epics are incredibly good.

Heh, I've got warriors drooling on my blades.  I've heard
people say rangers got the best deal out of all the melees
because of the 40% permanent haste on Swiftwind and the
slow/dot on Earthcaller.  13/21 and 14/24 damage/delay 
ratios on each weapon respectively is nothing to sneer
at either.
 
Plus the lightning is a lot cooler than silly green
leaves of the druid or the "lightsabers" of the warriors.
