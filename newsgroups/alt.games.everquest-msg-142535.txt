If you mean a result that is different than what you want, then sure,
label it evil if you want.

I assure you, I don't send money to political organizations lightly,
and I'm very satisfied with the way the ACLU spends it. On just the

of my membership.

You know, I can go down to the local car dealership and buy a brand
new Ford, but it won't be at all like the Ford my grandfather drove.
