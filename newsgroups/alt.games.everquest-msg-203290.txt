I totally disagree.  The moment you try to be generic/universal you
give up any hope of ever being excellent.  The world has plenty of
one-size-fits-all crap in it already.  There are thousands of solo
games out there, with more titles coming out all the time.  You want
a game tailored to solo play go play one.  I am glad that SOE is
holding to at least part of TheVision[tm], it gives focus to their
efforts and is part of what makes EQ "special".
