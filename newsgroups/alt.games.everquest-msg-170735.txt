I have been able to correct the infamous "booted to desktop" on three 
seperate systems now using this method. I'm not saying that this will 
work for everyone. Also, if you aren't familiar with loading drivers, 
fixing IRQ conflicts or are just aren't real computer literate, you may 
want to get some extra help.


A step for step of how to disable ACPI mode in Windows XP -by Andy 
Maddock/Cakewalk-
1) Go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > System > Hardware > Device
Manager
2) Choose View > Resources by Type
3) You'll a list of devices and their respective IRQs.
4) Alternatively you can run MSINFO32 and export the file as .nfo (to 
view on other XP systems) or as a .txt file.

ACPI

Although ACPI is designed to allow easy integration of power
management and PCI Bus resources, we have seen numerous cases where 
disabling ACPI as improved performance and eliminated resource 
conflicts. Please note that you will need to have all of your device 
drivers present when doing this, as Windows will re-enumerate your 
hardware and prompt you for the drivers.

The following lists steps to remove ACPI from your system.

1. Open Device Manager from Control Panel - System - Hardware - Device 
Manager
2. Go to Computer tab and select the "ACPI enabled PC" option that you 
have there
a. Select Properties
b. Go to Driver tab
c. Press Update Driver...
3. "Welcome to Upgrade Device Driver" wizard opens up, press next to the 
first question. From the next page select "Display a list of the known 
drivers for this device so that I can choose a specific driver"
4. Select "Show all hardware of this device class"
5. From "(Standard computers)" select "Standard PC"
6. After the new driver has been installed press reboot
7. After reboot Windows XP redetects all of your hardware and installs 
device drivers again for them.
8. After reinstalling device drivers open Device Manager once again and 
open Computer tab and look if you have two "Standard PC" devices there. 
If you do have a look at the properties of both "Standard PC" devices 
and remove the one which has "driver not installed" in the Device Status 
screen
9. You are done and ACPI is no longer in use with Windows XP
