It works ok on fleeing mobs since you only have to stun them long enough for
your pet to catch up. Your pet is bashing away too, so it isn't that bad.
You are right in a head on fight, stuns seem nearly pointless.

Never really tried that. Kind of worried about drawing aggression with a
cloth clad chanter and getting hit more then once. When things start going
bad, I just bail out to the zone line while the pet dies. Haven't had to do
that a lot.

I would have to check the characters int/mana pool but it isn't going to be
extrodinary. Just a DE with max points dumped into int. I did make a silver
int ring for another 2 int beyond the equipment I listed.

The technique balances out. Yes the stuns suck in every way imaginable, but
fear is only a level 4 spell and lasts for half the fight. I don't even know
what the higher level fear spells are called since I am still using the
level 4 spell.

When I first started the enc I had heard all the scare stories about how
they were difficult to run outside of a group and how their pets sucked.
Really, I am killing the same exact mobs I was killing with my magician and
necro at the same levels. Fights are mana intensive, but with Breeze
downtime is about the same.
