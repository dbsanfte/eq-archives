OBJECTION!!!!!!!!!

Nuclear Physics also includes the operation of a nuclear plant, which does
*very much* require skill on many levels.

You need mental acuity to learn how to operate a plant under steady-state,
transient, and casualty conditions.  Even during non-casualty operations,
where you are required to use the manuals, you have to understand how
various systems interelate, and how your doing one proceedure will affect
the entire plant, what limitations are imposed on the plant as a result of
various operations or equipment that is out-of-commission, and how the
precautions and limitations of one proceedure may limit or preclude various
other operations.  That's not even including casualties, where you have to
know the immediate actions without use of the manuals.  And that's just the
operation, we won't even get into maintainence and planning.

You need physical strength (particularly if you're a mechanic).  Valves that
are stuck on their seats due to thermal effects are bad enough when they're
small valves.  Taking care of them when they're large steam valves can take
several people putting everything they've got into it.  On top of that,
we've got several valves that pretty much require two or more people to
operate in normal circumstances.  Let's just say that a steam plant startup
can be an exhausting evolution.

And, you need mad-skillz in management and coordination.  Lighting off a
steam plant with a watchteam of nub watchstanders can be an exercise in
frustration.  Sure, you may know how to do everything that needs to be done,
but you can't do it all at once, so you've got to know which watchstanders
need you there to walk them through, and which ones can be given an order
and left to their own to carry it out.

/sigh ok, enough bitching.  None the less, don't tell me that nuclear
physics doesn't require skill, because the operations side of the house is
all about learning those skills as you progress from being a nub (non-useful
body), to a supervisor.
