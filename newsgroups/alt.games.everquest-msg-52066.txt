*Patch Day*

We, err, like fixed some stuff, but man that Fan Fair was so much fun
that I guess that we, err, like kinda forgot what we put in the patch.
<aside> What ? Oh yes we did some stuff to Chardok and probably fixed
some quests or sumting. Oh and there is that new grafics bug we put in,
oh I mean "Ware the GREEN MIST!!", that should do.
