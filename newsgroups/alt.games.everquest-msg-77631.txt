    You have to recognize where this policy came from. Pre-Kunark, the only
places one could go post-45 to get great lewt and XP were Sol B and Lower
Guk. Top guilds would own camps 24/7 and not allow anyone else into them,
then charge outrageous sums for the gear from them (if the best caster robe
in game is the SMR, and they control Archmagi all the time, then all casters
have to go to them). The same thing happened when the planes opened up - top
guilds would set up shop there and kill every static repop, and KS/train
anyone who tried to also come up. Ask someone who is old enough from The
Rathe why BotS (Blood of the Spider) used to be called Brotherhood of the
Spider to hear some of the absolutely assinine things that happened.

    Players asked for a policy that made "whoever does most damage gets the
kill" obsolete, as it allowed these high-end players to hog spots forever.
The solution Verant gave us is the PNP - Play Nice Policy. It first
described what a killsteal was, made a killsteal against the rules, and set
forth the doctrine of sharing spawns. Most older players would never think
of using the PNP to force a spawn sharing arrangement with the GMs - it goes
against the "first-come, first-serve" ethos of camping. But the tool has to
remain in place if you don't want a repeat of what happened before, with
certain contested spawns/spots being owned by one group for as long as they
wanted to keep players there.
