Aye, bcarshaman, there is tons yet to do. As you enter your 30's you're just 
getting started on one of my favorite zones in the game: Nektropos Castle 
and the saga of Lord Everling. Savor that one, it's one the great adventures 
of the game and will keep you occupied for the rest of your career. Indeed, 
there is now an access quest at level 50 opening way to a new adventure 
within Nektropos Castle, and I've yet to finish exploring that. Even the 
dogs of death in the courtyard are level 50 ...
