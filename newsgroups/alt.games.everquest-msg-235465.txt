Well the bait 'sploiters are going to end up with pretty much nothing
for their troubles... not that it was that much trouble :)

I feel for a lot of the legitmate users though the tribute values have
gone right down the tubes. I doubt my mid level characters will be
able to consistently afford much them now, and my higher level
characters... hard to say yet whether they'll be able to afford more
than one decent one.

I mean sure FS probably shouldn't have been 600 tribute... but 60 or
70 would have been nice... even 30 or 40... now it looks like I won't
be able to keep more than a couple buffs up without spending
considerable time farming.

I'd like to see tribute added to much of the no drop stuff to give it
some utility... not the 'for a quest items', just the equipment
(armour / weapons / quest rewards). A few dozen would be all it would
take to give some worthwhile utility to much of the items that
currently rot or get destroyed currently.

I'd also like to see the ability to turn them on in the field. Not
rapidly during the fight/sit cycle... but maybe if you could toggle
them on a 10 or 15 minute timer so that you don't burn off 1000
tribute x5 group members while you wait for that twit who will 'brt'
but takes an hour to show up for an ldon... etc.
