>I'm just wondering if an agnostic human monk fromQeynos would be able to train
in the Freeport monk guild.

You should be able to train with out a problem as long as you haven't screwed
your faction so you can't get close enough with out them wacking you.

 The faction hits for killing orcs include ashen order so just go wack them if
you need to repair it.
