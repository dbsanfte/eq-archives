I gave a friend of mine a EQ disc I don't use since it is just the Classic
Mini box.  Since the orignal EQ comes with the Kunark Expansion I have no
use for it. I know that you can't play two CD-Keys a the same time so my
question is do I have to do anything for him to create a account and play
the same time.
