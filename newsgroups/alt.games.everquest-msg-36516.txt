The stupid assinine argument:  Numbers would remove the "emmersive
effect" of the game.

Of course, you had numbers on hitpoints, damage, mana cost, casting
time, level, AC, stats, damage, delay, etc...

Pretty much the ONLY two things that didn't have numbers was your
current mana pool (had to guess that one) and your skills.

BTW, that line of stupidity was from head poopy head himself, Abashi.
