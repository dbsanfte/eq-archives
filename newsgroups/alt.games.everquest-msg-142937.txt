 Hey, I may actually buy a sound card for my new PC. I've had
sound/music off for the longest time in EQ so when I got a new PC I
didn't bother with a soundcard. Mostly because of all the problems

die in 60.

 The /deletepetition is nice. I've had a few things that I've petitioned
before that got resolved before someone got to them.
