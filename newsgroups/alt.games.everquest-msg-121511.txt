I did the 756 pp spell-only version of the quest last night. I kind of
had second thoughts about not doing the earring (don't need the wis,
but the mana and resists would be nice even without FT1 from the
solstice ring), especially once I saw how expensive the spell-only
version was. But, my bank account can't really afford the full quest
yet and I wanted the spell *NOW* (Mmm, breeze and 2057hp/820AC self
buffed :) ) so I'll reconsider the earring at a later point.
