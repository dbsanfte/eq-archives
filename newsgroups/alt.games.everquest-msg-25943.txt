Well, the PB AOE spells aren't point blank either, come to
think of it, they are "centered on self" AOE.

I've just always refered to them as PB as a shorthand for that.

The PB AOE damage spells do damage to everything in range
other than group members, the PB AOE heal spells do healing
to everything in range that -is- a group member, differing range
factors aside they seem like two sides of a coin.

Still self centered isn't it?  I mean, if it was targettable (but I think
my experiments showed it wasn't) it would be a fine adujunct to
a quad kiting party, if such things existed (oddly that seems to
be almost exclusively a solo endeavor)

I didn't look at range, hmm, if it works out past melee distance
I could try rooting a bunch of skyblue mobs in a cluster (enstilling
em I should say) and standing outside melee but inside earthquake
(Tremor?  forget what the highest level one I have is) and nuking em
all dead at once.  Bet I won't have the mana to do it though, I
generally have to go near OOM to Retribution blues to death.

There's a thought, AE nukeing massively green mobs might be a time
saver.  Hmm, I actually did use it once when being PL'd at a young
age; went to befallen, got SLN and a high level DS, then would
Word to do damage to all the stuff that was killing itself on me.  If
things die only via DS you don't get the kill, but the DS damage
doesn't count, so -any- damage done means you get all the exp.
Trouble is targetting all the mobs before they kill themselves, which
I eliminated by using Word to hurt em all.
