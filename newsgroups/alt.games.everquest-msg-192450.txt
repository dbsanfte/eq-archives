Yes, but SOE has given their permission (or so all those artists keep
saying...I haven't asked SOE meself).  Norrath's Studio hasn't had a law
suit slapped on them yet, so I think SOE is fine with it.

I myself have a website devoted to fan art (not Everquest though), but I
also have the specific permission of the owner and appropriate copyright
credit on every page.
