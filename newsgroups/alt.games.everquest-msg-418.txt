Depends on the skill.  Some are, some aren't.

When Kunark was released, they upped the level cap from 50 to 60.

When they did this, they also upped the skill cap on a lot of skills, but to
make it so that the people who didn't have Kunark had the same skill caps as
those that did, the old caps apply until level 50.

After 50, the new caps apply.

Example: my channelling skill went from 200 to 202 within 10 minutes of
hitting 51.
