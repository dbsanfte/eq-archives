Components (Dhea and Comfrey) are bought from alchemy vendors, best price is
64pp for one potion.  Success rate at 180 alchemy would be less than 95%
probably on the order of 85 to 90%.  With the +15% alchemy item, you can
probably get this up to 95% success rate.  So, for one 10 charge Adrenaline
Tap potion, figure 672pp average to make it with best success rate.

I don't know about it's stacking, cap, etc.  I believe that it counts as
spell haste, unless Flurry haste is treated differently from things like
Alacrity.  It's stacking is likely to be the same as the spell line of
haste.

All information on the pricing and components snagged form
