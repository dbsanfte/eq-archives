Getting groups is certainly a lot easier as a cleric or chanter, pre luclin
anyway !!  I must admit I chuckle when I see 5 level 60 clerics looking for
group in Velk and Sebilis (damn those alt levels)

I wouldn't class a guild as good though if they accepted any 50+
cleric/chanter, just cuz they are a highly desired class.  I can actually
think of a lot of high end raids where Chanters arent raid critical.. and
their only use is buffing/tash suicide - in which case 1 chanter is plenty.
(other group buffing, Kodiaks, shissar haste etc)

Even at higher levels, depending on the character.  I've seen an enchanter
solo in Skyfire (mid 50's), a 50 chanter solo in oot (seafurbies), a 60
chanter on our server has solo'd a WW dragon heh
