I disagree that wizards are good for soloing, but that's probably
because I'm a newbie (level 18 wizard) and playing him wrong.

My experience is that Root is too unreliable against even con mobs.
It's more reliable on blue and cyan con mobs, but even then, you
have to be very careful to get the attention of just one mob.

For example, more than one blue con mob, and my casting is generally
interrupted too much to emerge victorious.  And even if I manage to
get spells off, I don't have enough mana to defeat two blue con mobs.

By contrast, my mage (level 14) has a pet that I find serves as a
better root than Root.  Two blue con mobs?  No problem.  One yellow
con mob?  No problem.  Got the attention of a small army?  Let your
pet take the heat while you make a hasty escape.  And the mage nukes
seem on par with the wizard nukes.

My druid (level 17) has SoW for easy kiting (almost never get hit).
Also Grasping Roots (for full damage DoTs) and Snare (makes it that
much easier to kite).

I've also learned to avoid AoE spells like the plague.  Even with
a party with tanks, I just can't get the aggro off me (if I use an
AoE spell).  (I've read about "AoE groups" but have no idea how
the wizard manages to avoid aggro.)

But...again: I'm probably just playing the wizard wrong.  I've been
familiarizing myself with several classes (as you can tell) and have
not gotten far in any of them.  But I'd say my mage and druid solo
far better than my wizard.

For now, wizard seems like one of the most weak classes to me.
They just don't seem to have anything going for them that other
classes don't already do better.  But I'm sure some experienced
wizards will set me straight on some better tactics.  At least,
I hope so!
