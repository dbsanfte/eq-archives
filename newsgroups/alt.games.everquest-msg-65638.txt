If I were Verant, I'd seriously consider three options:

1. Go back to DX8.0a universally.

2. If #1 would require giving up some DX8.1 functionality that they
really really want to keep, fork the EQ client, so that those on Win95
can give up some of the new functionality to keep playing, and give
six months notice that the Win95 client will go away.  That gives the
players decent notice that they have to get off Win95 or give up EQ.
The problem with the way they dropped Win95 is not the fact that they
dropped it, but that they dropped it with about two weeks notice.

3. Sell OEM Win98 from their online store: $60 and includes six months
of free EQ.  That would make Win98 essentially free for their current
Win95 customers, at pretty much no cost to Verant (I think they can
get the OEM Win98 at a low enough price to make a profit at $60, and
that profit would be enough to cover the six months of free EQ
(remember, it doesn't cost them $10 to provide a month of EQ)).
