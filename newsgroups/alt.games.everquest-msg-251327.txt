Was any of the damage shields a 57 druid could cast improved? Maybe DS isn't
much good against xp mobs (if I'm stuck as primary healer in a serious
combat, I see it as a waste of medding time, unless you are fighting
multiple mobs at the same time, which at the upper levels is very very bad)
but it's great for powerlevelling and exterminating dungeons full of green
faction yielding beasties.

If it's mage only, then oh well, my experiences with mages is they survive
being hit with the grace of a soap bubble so the last two options are iffy.
Do mages use DS post 60 in groups?
