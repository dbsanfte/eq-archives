If you can remember your station name or get it from Sony, you'll probably
be able to continue with your existing characters.
Sony say they guarantee that they keep your characters for 3 months, but
most people believe they've never deleted any yet.  Some people say they've
rejoined after 3 years of non-playing.
You just need to re-provide them with CC details and away you go where you
left off.

Hello All EQ fans (past, present, and future)

I played EQ the first 2 years when it came out, I only averaged 5 hours a
week and only got to level 18 High Elf Enchanter, I had lots of fun and met
many great people and characters too (most were GOOD and helpful).

I bought the 1st two expansions RoK and Scars, never got to play Scars
fully, I did hitch a ride with some groups to travel this cold icy land.

I want to get back into EQ, is it WORTH to buy EQ again or wait for EQ2?

Will EQ be supported when EQ2 comes out, or will they fade EQ out right away
or months down the road or will SONY/Verant support both FOREVER?

any help on this matter would be APPRECIATED, thank you.

have fun and hope to meet some of you SOON

bye

John
