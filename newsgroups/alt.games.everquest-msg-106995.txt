Okay heres the deal, We have a fan website.
On this website We have an auctions section.

It isn't functional yet, but will be soon.
We are planning to add sections to this auction where you can buy or
sell "in game items" that you are no longer using,( i.e. Staff of Uber
Item or that amazing Newbie weapon "Dagger of No Drop")
for cold hard cash in whatever currency you preffer, dollars, pounds,
francs etc.

This would allow you to make money, from your game play.

We are aware that Verant has a policy against this, however in looking
at case law involving intellectual property rights, we feel the claim
they make wouldn't acutally stand up in court.

What triggered this question is a search on Ebay, for a particular
item that is kind of hard to find.  When we got the result we got an
ad that read something like...
I am selling a pencil, if you buy my pencil I will GIVE you this "in
game item goes here"

We figured this sounds pretty ridiculous, you PAY Verant to play this
game, and you dedicate ALOT of time to playing it.  Eventually you
will accumulate a large store of items you no longer have use for.

Why not be able to put an ad up somewhere that says loud and proud "I
have this Item for sale, it was hard to get, but I got it, I no longer
need it, would you like to buy it!"

Since Ebay and others have decided to not try and fight for their
members, we are going to give this a shot and when and if Verant, Sony
or anyone else comes bringing lawsuits, we will fight it to the bitter
end.  We honestly hope that this will set a good precedent, for anyone
who chooses to earn money through non-traditional sources.

Think about it this way.
If Verants claim that any items earned in game are property of Verant,
then there would be no legal way for a buy/sell/trade/auction function
in game.

We have seen the arguments both for and against this type of thing in
the past.  However since the game itself has changed alot, we wonder
if the players have as well.

So we here at accessgame wish to pose the question to everyone who
reads this news group.

Would you wish to have a service that allows you to buy and sell items
from the game in real life for money?   Especially if we protected all
of your personal account information?  So that it would be that much
harder to get suspended?

We will be reading the replies to this thread over the next few days
with earnest.  So please post all replies to this NG.

We look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely
Rage Mage
