Aye.  Just last night while leading a group killing dark blue
mobs for xp I saw our Monk lose a bubble of HP and stabilize,
obviously feigned:
me:   "[Monk] how many on you?"
Monk: "four"
me:   "[Bard] can you mez three?"
Bard: "yes"
Monk: "four inc"
A busy Bard is usually a very good thing to see in an xp group.
