Asking around in POK about this, someone reccomended the EZboard for FV. 
  A web search revealed said board, and particularly:

http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59

which seems to be where FV open raids and the like are announced.  Looks 
like there was a naggy run scheduled for the 15th which has been 
cancelled, and now one is there for the 22nd.  Can we hold out for three 
more days at the abyssimal level of 52?

I see nothing scheduled for Lady Vox at all, which might mean we could 
do it if we wanted.. only I don't have 18 friends under 52, nor do I 
have several level 65's to come buff us for a single group try.

We could try opening up a post of our own to get it together as an "open 
raid", it would help that since we don't have any need for any of their 
drops, we won't have to "reserved one of the books" or something like that.

Splendid One, 52 gnomage with run 3 and regen 1, rapidly running out of 
the need to do sub 56 aa at all
