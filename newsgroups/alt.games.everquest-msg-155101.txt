I've used shadow step with my necro not only to get a head start on
running away, but also used it as an opportunity to get a spell off
without having the mob beating on me.  With the fear line it's fairly
useful.

It also seems to be a way to get the mob onto your pet more reliably
than just trying to back out of aggro range, but aggro is rarely a
problem for my necro.
