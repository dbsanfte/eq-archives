Their damage ratio is also slightly better than regular velium (which is
same ratio as Fine Steel)

You can also get them via a quest, 4 giant warrior helmets to (I think) the
chaimberlane in Icewell Keep.  Never seen one drop off the coldain,
but then my 30 druid is the giant friend and has only killed a few, their
wolves are more his speed.
