If you really want to do mad dps on a warrior, get one of these:

Earthshaker
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM
Weight: 16.0 Size: GIANT
Slot: PRIMARY
Delay: 70 Damage: 37
Str: +6 Dex: -5 Sta: +6
Weapon Skill: Two Hand Slash

Races: All Races
Effect: Earthquake

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=462

its expensive though.   Read the alla's link to see how to use it and
why it costs so much (doesnt drop anymore and is really overpowered)
