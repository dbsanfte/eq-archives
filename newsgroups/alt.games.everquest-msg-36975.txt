Bizbee plays a druid. So do I. Trust me, Druids have it much worse.
Kinda tells you something that he still feels that way, huh?

I never ask for a fee for any "spell" service - SOW, ports, etc. I
take money when it's offered. If someone says "how much", my response
is "whatever you think is fair". Sure, some run off without paying,
but the "thanks" is enough. When I don't demand money - in fact, I
don't even talk about money until they bring it up-, I've found people
tend to be more generous with donations. I've gotten enough 30+pp
donations for single ports to more than make up for all the people who
run of without paying.

Anyway, back on rezzes... 100pp for a rez is simply absurd. I could
understand if there were some high-price reagent involved, but "pay me
100p or no rez for you!" is just being a greedy asshole.
