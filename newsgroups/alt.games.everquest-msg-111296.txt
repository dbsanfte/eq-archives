Probably not going to happen.

I'd be happy if Verant pulled their heads out of their asses about luclin
spell drops.

Like have Everlasting Breath, Levitation, and Remove Greater Curse drop off
of things that ever actually die.  Especially since they're used by so many
classes (shm/dru on all 3, plus cleric on RGC and wiz on levitation)

Here's a typical few lines on the global auction channel:
WTS boots of flowing slime 100k
WTB everlasting breath | levitation | remove greater curse | spirit of eagle
WTS reaver | heavy rubicite girdle | WTB cowl of mortality
WTB Mark of retribution | Remove greater curse | stun command
WTS fungi 40k firm
WTB fungi 35k firm
WTB Torpor | Malo | Everlasting Breath | Levitation | Remove greater curse -
trading fungi or 25k for torpor or malo

Whee.... I'll probably never see a copy of any of those 3 spells.

Best solution for EB/lev is to make them vendor bought since they're in such
high demand.  In general anyone who thinks about it will realize that having
remove greater curse is really not that big of a deal since so few things
actually cast curses.
