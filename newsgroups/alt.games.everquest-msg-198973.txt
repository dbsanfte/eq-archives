Upon launching the game, right click unsticks it in the EULA screen 
for me. However, after I log out and back in without relaunching the 
game, it will stick in the EULA screen again -- but right click doesn't 
work now. In this case the fix is to Alt-Enter to windowed mode, reselect 
the EQ window, then go back to fullscreen.
