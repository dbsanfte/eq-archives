I suspect that this has already been debated by some of the greatest minds
in the Everquest community, but I had an interesting discussion with a
character yesterday.  He asked to be "porked" and I didn't understand what
he was asking for.  Upon explanation, he indicated that the spell Spirit of
Wolf (SoW) is pronounced as that of an adult female swine.  My contention is
that the pronunciation should be as that of casting seed or mending clothes.

I open the discussion to the newsgroup (too bad there is not a polling
process) so that I can adopt the opinion of the masses.

Thanks
