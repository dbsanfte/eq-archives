/agree Sensei...my husband likes the game, but seems to be running low on
stuff to do already and he's only level 15.  I played until level 10 and got
bored.  I prefer EQ.  I just got the first time billing and its $12.95 US
just so everyone knows, I wasn't sure how much it was going to be.  We
figured the same as EQ but it is a little more expensive.  The look of DAoC
is nice, but I'm not giving up EQ.

My 2cp worth.
