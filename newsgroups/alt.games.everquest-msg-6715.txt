For you PvP'ers, what effect (affect? :-) do you think this will have?

Thanks. :-)

Are quivers player-made?

Hmmm, perhaps it will actually reduce gate costs for us none-gaters?
One can only hope. :-)

Yes, thankyouverrymuch.  I can still remember Karnors Castle at level
30. :-)

Useful.

Very useful. I have missed something like this.

I hope it disappears if I put the current item somewhere as well.
That extra click is getting tedious, at least when I juggle

Awwww, I really liked that feature.  I'm gonna miss it.   

I thought it was idiot-proof, because they said whatever was in the
bag, and the current price, but:

1. Make something idiot-proof
2. Nature makes a bigger idiot

So far, Nature seems to be winning.

Yes, celebrations.  8 full bags in the bank plus full inventory was
tricky.
