I'm pretty sure they've removed no more than 1 spell...they do have extra
spells listed that don't exist on vendors though, that's true.  Then again,
right below the description are people saying that the spell doesn't exist,
so there's no huge surprise.

As for casting times and mana requirements being wrong...I can honestly say
that in the 4 years I've been playing virtually every day (yes, I'm that
pathetic with no life :p ) almost exclusively playing casters...I've never
paid much heed to that stuff anyway.  It's not like I memorize the casting
times or mana cost...I just right-click on the spell if I want to know.
