Exactly. Eq IS number one. Verant's other game, Star Wars Galaxies, is
assured of being number one or at least number two. There is no
question of whether or not that will happen. The only way Star Wars
Galaxies won't have 500,000 subscribers within 6 months after release,
would be if it was a huge smoldering pile of excrement.

Even UO is a PHENOMENAL commercial success and its still around.

The only reason why people are even still playing halflife is due to
the additions fans made, such as counterstrike.

They have amazing longevity.

I think verant figured out that there is no reason to make an
Everquest 2. Essentially they can turn the current Everquest slowly
into an Everquest 2 while mostly retaining 400,000 or more monthly
subscribers. There one large mistake is the 3 dollar price hike. I
think just with the competition from their own Star Wars Galaxies it
will cause many people to leave EQ. 

"I am really enjoying Star Wars Galaxies for $15.95- $19.95 per month
and I hardly play EQ anymore at all. I would have kept paying for eq
anyway at $9.95 but don't see the point at $12.95." I think you'll see
a lot of that as well as many people saying,

"CAN I HAVE YOUR STUFFS!!??"

I agree. Though one thing that I hope EQ teaches many companies is the
importance of built in modularity. Essentially every single part of
their graphics, game, design, hardcoded statistics, etc should be
totally upgradeable or changed very easily without somehow making a
character delete needed. Verant has currently been playing catch up
when they bump into areas which they can't change easily such as the
heck levels in the  xp table (which they never did actually change in
the code  but finally used external math to correct) They had a
similar thing happen with the hybrid xp. 

Really at some point it would be best if Verant rebuilt the background
that is EQ, such as all the character classes and races and such, then
turned off EQ for about a week deleting all characters and releasing
this "new" game. The could be being built concurrently with normal EQ
running so the change would be mostly seamless. The current characters
and XP earned are one of the largest hurdles to EQ's design totally
changing and of course verant would not want to delete them and cause
a customer mass exodus even if the game was GREATLY improved.

Another factor is that after you have played a game like this for
three years, you get bored with the world even if they keep adding on.
No matter how much I try I can't live in Luclin or Velious all the
time. Eventually I find myself back in East Commons looking at the
horrible three year old design limitations of a big newbie zone with
only two orc camps.

You only have to go and read the Star Wars Galaxies faq to see just
how much Verant itself has learned from Everquest. Mostly its very
obvious that they've learned what players want and how what players
want IS the most important thing. The Star Wars galaxies faq is the
total opposite of the old EQ dogma "you are in our world now and WE
know what is the best for you and the most fun! You'd not be having
fun unless a boat trip took 45 minutes!"

http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/features/faq.jsp

You can read that and see some things which players have long thought
should be in EQ, basic item decay and a viable player skill item
repair and item building trade system. It even says that you won't
even SEE npc merchants in the game much. The game will be built from
the ground up to have players as the traders and furnishers of items.
It will even have the bazarr like vendorization of players, though at
the rate EQ is going you might see this in Star Wars Galaxies before
you do in EQ.
