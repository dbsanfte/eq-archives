From the shadows, the mysterious "Adam Russell"
<REMOVE_THIS_adamrussell@sbcglobal.net> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>I've been having problems dealing with trackers lately and so I want to
>state a point that it seems like alot of people dont get.  I play a bard and
>so I pull alot in ldon.  When we start I tell the tracker (if we have a
>druid or ranger) to please check track and give me compass direction if a
>name shows up and then I can head that way.  For some reason they keep
>telling me "he is left" or "he is that way".
