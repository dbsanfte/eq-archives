Now if a phone number was posted on usenet like 619-398-1400 would
that be harvested by the bots too for phone solictation?

I mean (619)398-1400 it was posted as (619)398-1400 on the BL site,
and it is alleged to belong to a specific scumbag, I can't call
(619)398-1400 but if someone can dial (619)398-1400 and see who that
is it would be interesting.

I am pleased and going to subscribe to Allakhazam (after being
foolishly resistant) after reading this post on the BL forum:
