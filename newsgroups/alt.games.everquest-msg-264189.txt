Well, yeah, every MMOG I've played continued development after release and 
had bugs that continued to need fixing, etc. I don't think there's anything 
unusual about that, or even unacceptable in principle. The key questions for 
release readiness imo are: how playable is it and how fun is it? As it is 
today, I think it meets the fun test, but it doesn't meet my standard of 
overall readiness because there are just too many times when it's still 
unplayable, laggy and crash-prone. Those things absolutely have to be fixed.

They are probably working on packaging/distribution independently  of 
development and will have all components of the Bill of Materials 
manufactured and ready for assembly, they just need a gold disc to drop in 
the box -- a disc that will install the core client assets that can be 
patched to completion on the day of actual release. So they can continue 
working on the release code up until the day of release without worrying 
about the usual gold disc and channel distribution issues.

So, if they continue focusing on stability over the next couple of weeks and 
keep burning the candle on all three ends it's conceivable that they could 
hit a Nov 8 date, but it seems like a pretty iffy proposition to me. The 
reason I'm here posting now is because of a CTD while tradeskilling and it's 
not the only one I've had today.
