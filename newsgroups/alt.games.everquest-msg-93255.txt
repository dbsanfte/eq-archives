I have long since given up on keeping my melee skills up with my shaman.  He
only using piercing, his other weapon skills, are below 50.  Fortunately,
there are plenty of piercing weapons with stats, that are also equipable in
the range slot, so I can have two different +WIS piercers.  I think my
piercing skill is around 130 now.
