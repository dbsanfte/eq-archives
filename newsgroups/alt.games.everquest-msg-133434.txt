}I've heard the phrase "rez effects" used regarding a player who's just
}been rezzed by a cleric.  What exactly does that mean?  I keep
}picturing it as being something like a person who's just had surgery,
}is in the recovery room and waking up from the anesthesia and is still
}real groggy and out of it.  Would that be a fair description of "rez
}effects"? 

Yes.  Specifically, most of your physical stats (like Str, mainly) are 
much lower, and it takes a few minutes for them to recover.  So if you 
loot your corpse right after a rez, you'll suddenly be so encumbered 
you're immobile, unless you looted more str gear than weight, or are a 
monk or something.

}Also, would one have "rez effects" if they just got a Revive (no
}experience rez) from a cleric or do rez effects only occur with
}experience giving rezzes?

Yes, revives have rez effects.
