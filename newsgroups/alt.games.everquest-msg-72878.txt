Well, many of us are aware of the eccentricity of the spellchecker, but, so
far as I'm concerned, that is still no excuse for mis-using words that are
basic to the English language. I learned to read some 45 years ago, and to
spell very well shortly thereafter. Words have always been my passion (and
yes, I do know that I occasionally mis-use them), and I have never seen fit
to overlook another intelligent human's mis-use/mis-spelling of them. I
never use a spellchecker. I've never needed one, partially due to the fact
that, as I said in my opening, words are my passion. I deem it to be a great
pity that others (primarily the younger of us, it seems) seem to feel no
need to be better than they can be. (a shameless plug... sorry, but it
really does fit)

I suppose I should subscribe to the NG alt.everquest.greatspellers/writers
... and I would, if such a thing existed. Unfortunately, it does not, and
most of you will KF me for being a pain in the ass about literacy. That's
okay, I really don't mind, so long as -one- someone, somewhere gets the
point.

Bradmeister, I was using your post as a launching point, I was not vilifying
you or your post. Mea culpa if you thought so.
