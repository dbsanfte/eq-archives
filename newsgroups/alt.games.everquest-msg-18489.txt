     My ranger and warrior have a set of macros just for
pulling.

I'm being chased by %t (green), and %s is very upset with me.
I'm running from %t (blue), and %s is being unreasonable.

And so on, one for each con color, and one generic one that
doesn't give the con.  I get asked constantly what command I
use to get the con into my pulling message.  Then, about half
the time, the other person says "Oh, that seems a little over
board" when I tell them about the multiple macros.  
   I'm surprised at that.  Sure it takes a little more typing,
but it does make a difference to the group if I'm bringing 
back a red as opposed to, say, a blue.   And they all fit
nicely into one side of a macro bank.
