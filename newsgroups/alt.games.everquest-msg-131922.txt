That's the 'myth' anyway. In reality, because all items don't benefit
the guild linearly on different classes, different skill levels, adn
different raid usefulness.

Raid Points earned is 100% an attendance system, and has very little do
to with aiding the guild's progression, rewarding effort, skill, or
contribution. 

There is ONE reason to ignore all these glaring faults though. It's a
faceless, blameless, predetermined, immune-to-ass-kissing system. It
totally removes 99% of the at-raid loot bitching by having a clearly
defined, simple to implement/understand, method for awarding loot. The
only human variables are what values are placed on the attendance and
awards. Once fixed, those change very rarely.

Unless you're part of a VERY close knit or small guild with everyone
pulling in the same direction, award systems are unworkable due to bias,
whether real or simply perceived. Unless you're been part of the loot
award system of a large or high level guild, you have no idea what it's
like, and how you're willing to ignore the failings of a points system
for the sake of killing the complaints.

As for /random, forget it. You're talking about far to small a sample
set of items and raids for the randomised inaccuracies to be levelled
out. Any system where someone on their first raid can loot the best item
in the game, over someone who has attended every single raid in the last
6 months, simply won't work. One guild I believe has a 'tier' system
where it's random between people of similar attendance rates, but vastly
differing attendees can't bid against each other, which is the only
possible way I can see random being implemented whatsoever.

An attendance based points system is especially bad for me. I'm a
working euro, in an EST based guild. 40% of points I have no access to.
Those I do attend I am usually first or second MT, and those early raids
generally have fewer numbers than the primetime 70 person rampages when
all the ESTers merge with the PSTers around my bedtime. I'm also an
officer, so have all the admin and raid orginisation stuff that goes
with that job, both on and off raids. As the most equipment-reliable
class, I'm made or broken by what equipment I have. No +hate weapon =
I'm useless. no other class has such a stringent restriction, and that
was exactly the reason cited for manastones being removed from the game
(clerics without stones weren't welcome on raids). I get the same points
for being at a raid in a pivotal position, that a frequently LD, not
skilled/equipped/reliable enough to do anything important, person gets
by simply showing up. 

Having seen both systems in action, and definitely being better off in
an award system, I still have to say points is 'better' for the long
term health of a guild.
