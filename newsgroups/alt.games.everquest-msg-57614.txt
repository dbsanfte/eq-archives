>>>examples snipped<<<

>> Which words were *you* thinking of which lends credence to the idea that
"Luclin's 'c' should be pronounced as an 's'"?<<

In all the examples, the "cl" were part of the same syllable. This would
seem to suggest the separation be:

Lu-clin

I always looked at it as this:

Luc-lin

which is where loose-lin would come from. I can also see luck-lynn from this
separation.

But hey, this is from a company that spelled Qeynos without an "U".
