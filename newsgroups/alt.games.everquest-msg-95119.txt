Does it seem to usually freeze up after playing a fairly consistent
length of time?

Might want to check your cooling - I've noticed a good session of EQ

CPU fan and 2 case fans (one in front pulling, one in back pashing)
plus the power supply fan.

I'm happy with 23.11.  I understand that some people have much better
