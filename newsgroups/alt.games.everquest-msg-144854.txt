I wonder why they added this?  Are there some classes that have so many
spells available that they need the room?  Otherwise, it seems to me
sufficient to just move unneeded spells to the back of the book.  It seems
pointless (and risky...just imagine a Mage accidently deleting the wrong
spell and losing their epic!).

What the spellbook really needs is the ability to make aliases for existing
spells.  That way, you could organize the book in several sections.  One
section might contain the spells, organized by type and level.  Then you
could have a page with aliases to the spells you use in normal groups, and a
page with aliases to your setup for traveling, and a page with aliases to
your setup for raiding, and so on.

I'm told Anarchy Online has something like this, and it is very useful.

I hope this means that the current search, which allows searching for items
that have an effect without specifying the effect, will stop matching items
with focus effects (unless they also have another effect, of course).
