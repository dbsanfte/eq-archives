Well I dont remember specifics, it was a long thought out plan tho on my
guilds boards (most rangers still dont have AM3 though so it can't be
tested)

Maybe primal/AoW bows will make up the extra damage you think 1 group of
rangers would be lacking?  Maybe they'd need to get some "lucky" shots? I
dunno.. my point though was its not impossible.

I don't know how ATK works with archery, but my guildie rangers are at
1800ish atk
