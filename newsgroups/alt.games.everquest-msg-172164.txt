>
>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Astrologer-to-the-stars Sydney Omarr, whose horoscope column in newspapers across the country was one of the first things many readers turned to in the morning, has died at 76.
>
>Omarr, blind and paralyzed from the neck down by multiple sclerosis, died Thursday at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica from complications from a heart attack.
>
>His own horoscope for that day was upbeat.
>
>``You will beat the odds, much to the astonishment of experts,'' predicted the six-line forecast that Omarr had dictated three months prior.
>
>Omarr, known to friends as a true Leo personality -- the Zodiac sign symbolized by the lion -- for his sharp mind, chivalrous manner and love of fine dining and cigars, was popular with politicians, sheiks, celebrities and the public because his predictions were generally considered to ring true, associates said.
>
>``The column itself was general, but he had a system for doing it,'' said Valerie Barbeaux, his companion and editorial adviser. ``We often kept letters, they said they (the horoscopes) were right on.''
>
>Although his vision vanished a decade ago and his crumbling health required him to rely on attendants around the clock, his mind remained sound and his spirits high. Omarr worked until suffering a massive heart attack on Dec. 23.
>
>An article last month in the Los Angeles Times chronicled Omarr and Barbeaux at work; he lying in bed with his head propped up on pillows, she poised before an old IBM Selectric II typewriter prepped with a blank sheet and carbon paper:
>
>``Syd, this is for Friday, Dec. 6 ... moon in Capricorn. Aries,'' said Barbeaux.
>
>``Expect some changes in connection with business, career,'' replied Omarr in a monotone. ``Written word plays major role; get ideas on paper.''
>
>``We need another line, Syd,'' prodded Barbeaux.
>
>``Flirtation begins innocently but could become hot and heavy,'' he divined after a brief pause.
>
>Born Sidney Kimmelman in Philadelphia, Omarr decided to change his name at age 15 after watching the movie ``Shanghai Gesture,'' starring Victor Mature as a character named Omar. He changed the spelling of his first name and adopted Omar as his last name, but added a second ``r,'' in accordance with certain numerological formulas.
>
>Omarr became fascinated with numerology and astrology as a teen. He wrote a book called ``Sydney Omarr's Private Course on Numerology,'' and sold copies for $2. He also started analyzing the horoscopes of movie stars for magazines.
>
>His career began to take off after he enlisted in the Army at 17. Omarr was sent to Okinawa during World War II, where his weekly Armed Forces Radio program, ``Sydney Omarr's Almanac,'' made him the first and only GI assigned astrology duty.
>
>After the war he took journalism courses at Mexico City College. His first job after college was for United Press as a news reporter. One of his first assignments was to interview Goodwin Knight, California's Republican governor, who had been reading Omarr's columns for years. The two men became good friends.
>
>Omarr later spent a decade as a CBS radio newsman before becoming a full-time columnist and astrological consultant to Hollywood stars.
>
>He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1971 but continued his work and appeared on television shows hosted by Mike Douglas, Johnny Carson and Merv Griffin.
>
>Omarr wrote 13 books -- one for each of the 12 signs of the zodiac and one for the entire year. The books were updated annually. He has sold 50 million copies nationwide.
>
>Defending astrology as both a science and an art was a lifelong passion for Omarr, associates said. Over the years, he managed to make a believer out of Tammy Smalls, wife of Omarr's friend and assistant Paul Smalls.
>
>``He was just right on,'' said Smalls. ``I don't even believe in astrology. When I met my husband, I said, 'Who do you work for?' We even got married on the day that he said.''
>
>His column, which is owned by the Tribune Co., appears in more than 200 daily newspapers. Arrangements were being made for his assistants to continue producing the column under Omarr's name, the Times reported.
>
>His column is probably created by a computer.
>
>Omarr is survived by his sister, Leah Lederhandler of Philadelphia.
