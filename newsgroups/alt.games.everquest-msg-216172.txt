We have a similar recruitment policy in my guild.  Recruits are expected to group and raid with us so that members get
to know them well enough to vote on making them a member.  A recruit requires a 2/3rd unambiguous vote to become a
member.  Included in the poll options is a "wait" selection and if the results are ambiguous, we post the poll again 2
weeks later.

We maintain a discussion thread for each current recruit and several members tend to search out information on them from
various souces.  In some cases, the officers have kicked out recruits in less then a week just based on reputation and
information from trusted sources.
