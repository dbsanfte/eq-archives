Unless you are snaring repeatedly, the Paladin should be able to get 
aggro off you.  I am assuming you are not using major hate proccing 
weapons as well.  Paladin stun is a great aggro generator.  Personally, 
it has been my experience that a mediocre SK is better than a mediocre 
Paladin.  A good player of either class works great however.
