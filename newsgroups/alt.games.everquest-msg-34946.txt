Think of them like a non-profit organization if you want to play for free.
Everybody plays for free all of the time, with the minimum required donation
of $9.89 per month automatically charged to a valid credit card.

Or we could think of them as a non-profit religious organization (or most of
them anyway) and they'll give you playing services for free, which cost them
no more than about $4 per month, and you can play for free with your minimum
required donation of $9.89 per month. (I always laugh at these preachers
advertising on the radio about their non-profit organizations, giving away
$10 worth of products absolutely FREE, 0% cost to you, no charge what so
ever, gift for anybody,....with your minimum required donation of at least
double (or sometimes tripple) the value of what they're giving.)
