Its about time someone tried forcing the prices down...

some of the stuff thats going there is no way its going to sell for the
prices people are asking,
its a joke what people post the items for they should have a site with
recomended prices, i was on one server and a good bard drum was 3000, on the
server i am on now there are more bards and the drum is worth 6000
