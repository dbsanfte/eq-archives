Less well known, the cleric item "Donal's Vambraces
of Mourning" cast a similar but more powerful buff,
Valor, for 220 hp every 10 seconds or so.  If the cleric
has Yaulp V as well, this doesnt even cut deep into
his mana regen (Yaulp, click, click, Yaulp, click, click)

Here too, the cleric certainly has the edge, with a better
rez at the same level.

A sufficiently high level cleric can also cast MoR and MoK
on the target mobs, MoR providing "unattributed" damage,
speeding kills without risk of outdamaging the PL victim, while
MoK is one of the cheapest healing plans in the game, barring
such goodies as the DW helm, Donals arms, Greaves of
Forbidden Rites, etc...

On the other hand, I'd rather PL you with my 34 druid than my
60 cleric, with a cleric its too much like work.  Druid casts
buffs, regen, and keeps DS on, Lazy Lazy Lazy.
