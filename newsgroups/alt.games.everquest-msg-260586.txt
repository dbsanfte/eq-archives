  Many developments these last two weeks.

  Got in a TZ/VZ raid a couple weeks ago. Came late to the party, TZ was
done, oh well.
At least I got my VZ flag. Disappointing fight: final VZ was just a normal
mob in toughness.
Though "just a normal mob" is pretty tough in Tactics.
  What I need most is Villiagers and RD in HoH. May be able to organize a
Villiagers
myself. Have to wait on RD, alas.

  Between gear upgrades and quest purchases, my plat is running very low.
Adas has more
mana to work with than ever, 4434 at latest, but she has to spend a lot of
time shooting
down HG's and IG's, or hunting up Flawless Rockhopper Hides. I also need to
work
on her Tailoring, so I have a need for lower-quality hides, at least.

  OoW is days away from screwing up the live servers again. Much is now
known about
the new AA's. Apparently, Wizards get one widely conisdered potentially
game-breaking:
the ability to port a party to THE WIZARD'S bind point. No more long runs
through
Siren's Grotto to ToV. Much easier entrances to Ssra and VT. And such like.
People are
complaining, whereas you previously heard them complain about the long runs
to these places. Presumably not the same set of people for both. Or at
least, they might grumble to themselves about a long run, but they grumble
to the devs about NOT having to do long runs.
Some people are never satisfied.

  Then there's the focus effects fiasco. My friend Kam, who plays  among
others Zkar (or Zk4r on message boards), is so incensed that the focus
effects were not carried at full strength through level 70 that he is
quitting the game. To him, even tapering is not warranted at this time. He
has argued his position in an extensive thread on the Monkly Business boards
("They're in their own little world now.") It's sad to see him go, but he
has to do what's best for him. For all of us, there's a point where the
aggravation and disappointment becomes just too much.  Many people have
issues with the direction the devs are going, and if the devs get too far
off the hoped-for path, they try some other game. Such is capitalism.

  Been working on my melees lately. Tosev can now recieve KEI, not that it
does him any good. The important thing for him is the next level, 46,
allowing Virtue. Neuveniu has hit 44, and for her KEI is a big deal; it will
allow her to solo tougher mobs by lifedraining them while kiting for
signifigant parts of the battle. Currently, she can do that, but it drains
her mana fast; with KEI she will suffer much less downtime.

  But I am about to have much less time to do this in, as well. Ihave
decided I have had enough of having a hard time finding groups on weekdays,
and no regular raids. I am getting Adas back into the guilded life. I have
posted an application to the Council of the Fellowship, where many of her
old KR friends are. They raid at night on weekends. Order of the Green
Knights would also fit my schedule, and I know I can work with Lords of
Corruption; but
the Council seems the best fit right now.
