Hi Kev, 

The Gems on an enchanter should change frequently. My favorites that
are on most of the time when not buffing or jewelry making. It all
depends on the mob I want dead.

Here is my choices when in a dungeon, were a loose pet is deadly! I go
petless, and if group members are looking for a Mob debuffer. If they
are looking for a group buffer, I change this radically!

Dungeon Fighting
1 DD (with no better DD caster)
1 AE MEZ (grouped with wizzy)
1 Alacrity (if party prefers)
2 Tashania (Always)
3 Choke 
4 Breeze (Normally) 
5 Tepid 
6 Whirl or Color (Stun)
7 Enthrall
8 Cancel Magic (against casters)
8 Strength Debuff De Jour

Often I will group with a druid or ranger to assist with bigger game
when fear kiting, to get the benefits of snare. They can't fear
non-animals and I can. I buff and breeze. My pet gets in the act as
well.

Open Air Fighting (Fear Kiting)
1 DD (with no better DD caster)
1 Alacrity (If preferred)
2 Tashania (Always)
3 Choke / Tepid
4 Breeze (Normally)
5 Fear type (chase moon)
6 Whirl (with my pet)
6 Color (Stun with charm)
7 Enthrall
8 Charm or Pet

Finally, when running across the Karanas, or around Lesser Faydark, I
have a set up to help maybe get me out of trouble. If it's red red I
might as well tash it, and go down fighting. Usually I chain mez/stun
and keep running. If it's pesky I fear it and try to zone.

Travelling 
1 Fear type (chase moon)
2 Tashania (Always)
3 Color (Stun with charm)
4 Breeze (Normally)
4 Invis, invis undead, or See Invis (if needed)
5 AE MEZ 
6 Whirl (with my pet)
7 Enthrall
8 Gate
