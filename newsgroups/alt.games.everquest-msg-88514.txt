When I first began playing EQ, I came to this board to ask advice on playing
strategies for my brand new Human Cleric.  I have followed some of the
advice and reached a lvl of 34.

I have found that playing a cleric is difficult.  I cannot solo.  I always
need a group.  I am lucky in that I joined a guild early on and generally
have no problem finding a tanking partner.

I currently have my toon in Eastern Wastes.  Is this a good place for her to
be?

Thanks for any advice.

Shuacat
