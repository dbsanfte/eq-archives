How 'bout picking a good "boxie"?  I won't buy a game if I can't get it in a
pristine box (same way I buy books).  Crumpled corners and other damage are
a big "no, no."  I'll sift through the whole inventory of a game to find
"the best one."  Of course, when I open it at home (never in the
car....something might get lost or damaged), it's the one missing
documentation or with the scratched and thumbprinted CD.  Needless to say, I
only mail order when I can't get the game any other way.

OTOH, my son does what you guys do.  He's already ripping open the box
before we reach the car and has the documentation all over the seat and the
CD out of the case before we can roll.  I hate that! :)
