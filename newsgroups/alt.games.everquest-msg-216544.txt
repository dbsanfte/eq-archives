I click accept on the adventure.  If Sony says that adventure is Crushbone,
that's what it is.  :)

And of course, the actual reality is that that rate, and mana regen both,
vary constantly.  You want me to "accept as a given" something that simply
will never happen?  *Unless* you med to full after each and every single
kill, the amount of mana the cleric has on incoming will vary from fight to
fight.  If I start fighting with the cleric at 30, it may dip to 20 (I'll
still pull), then work it's way up to 50 (I'll still pull), then dip down to
30 again (I'll still pull), and then we hit a deadend and backtrack a couple
halls so the next fight starts with the cleric at 80 (I'll...  you know),
etc., etc., etc.

So I'm sorry, but I can't accept as a given such a completely ludicrous
statement.  :)

If I'm doing a hard mission I will obviously be more cautious due to the
fact that the mobs are hitting for 900s.  I can no longer offtank one
(acceptably).  I can't let the shaman tank that add he slowed.  The cleric
can't channel through getting aggro.  And so on.  The difference between
normal and hard is considerable, so of course my play style will adjust
considerably to deal with the harder challenge.

And I'd still pull faster than you'd enjoy I'm sure.  :)

Let me help you out with math.

I'm ahead the moment you take a "med break" or pause the pulling.  If that
only happens to you once per dungeon, why was it that you were advocating
saving 80% mana anyway?  So the next time you take a "med break" or pause
the pulling to hit 80%, I still pulled another mob.  Now I've doubled how
much I'm ahead.  Next "med break" and I'm ahead by that much more again.

If you can manage your mana to be at 80% under constant pulls and will never
need med breaks, it doesn't sound like you ever needed anywhere close to
that amount of mana in reserve.

Which, of course, you didn't.  :P

I'm a great puller and I don't even *attempt* to "keep" a cleric's mana at
exactly the same percentage for any length of time.  It's a silly goal, and
an unachievable goal, so why bother trying?

There is a very distinct difference between my assertion that I will pull
with the cleric at 30% mana and your assertion that I will keep my cleric's
mana at 30% for an entire adventure.

You're the one aiming for a fixed mana percentage.  I'm the one aware of the
fact that if I pull when the cleric is at 30% (and of course if he finishes
a fight higher) that at some point there will be natural downtime (we hit a
dead end and have to backtrack for instance, or I pull a bit farther ahead
and then make a longer run, etc.).

If you can't see that I will gain a few minutes on you at the start, and then
*continue* to gain time on you as you repeatedly wait to be prepared for
armageddon, then you're just not paying attention, either to the discussion
or to the realities of the game.

You are so utterly stuck on this concept that the game will be so consistent
that I will pull with my healer at the same percentage every time.

That may happen when you stop and *wait* to get to 80%...  but pay attention
to those words describing how you're staying at 80% mana.

I'm known to ask for mana on raids and when enchanters, druids, shamans,
whatever, tell their mana I respond with "That meant clerics".

And you wait to get to 80% after every one of them.

And can't understand why I'll finish faster.

This discussion is hopeless isn't it?  :)  Until you can grasp those things,
you can never comprehend why my method is faster (aka better).

Can you possibly miss what is implied by what you are saying?  I have a
blowout pull where I use my reserves and the cleric ends up at 10%.  You
have a blowout pull where you use your reserves and end up at 60% (being
generous actually, as clerics will always be more careful with their mana
the lower they are, so that 80% cleric will be a lot more willing to just
throw mana at a problem rather than playing smart).  At absolute *worst* we
med up for the same amount of time and I keep my lead.

So the cleric tendency to be freer with mana at 80% doesn't apply?

You're wrong.  Unequivocally wrong.  And that's just the one of the
most glaringly wrong aspects of your position.

My cleric got up to 45% when we hit a dead end.  I pulled even faster for
a bit.  The shaman was on the ball, or the monk kept aggro for the first
half of the fight then dumped to the tank and let his 50/tick regen go to
work, or we were playing with no enchanter or bard but had two wizards to
rain on a 3-pull, or any of countless other reasons that the cleric's mana
will naturally increase even under constant fighting.  And then I pulled
even faster.  You still waited for the cleric to get back to 80%.

The game doesn't work in such a perfectly consistent manner.  Surely you
must admit to this otherwise your waiting for 80% mana is beyond too
cautious, it's simply stupid.  If you assert that you wait for 80% mana
before every fight, you cannot possibly assert that you won't fall behind.

After the 3rd pull, you pause, I pull.

After the 8th pull, you pause, I pull.

After the 19th pull, you pause, I pull.

After the 23rd pull, you pause, I pull.

And you can't figure out how I might gain time on you the entire way through
the dungeon?

Are you of the new breed of "PoP-tarts" that never did the "mow through as
many blues as possible" style of grinding?  So used to fighting mobs that
hit for 500s, proc for 500s, and mitigate slow that you are unable to
realize that you aren't fighting PoP mobs in LDoN dungeons?

When the mobs are trivial (and before PoP, that was the optimal and common
way to grind, with AE groups taking it to the extreme), the "tactic" is
speed.  You are right, the classic connotation of "tactics" doesn't apply. 
And the fact that you still use such tactics, like making sure you're healer
is ready for the next PoP mob you'll be pulling in a LDoN dungeon, is silly.
