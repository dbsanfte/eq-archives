Actually no. A good example is the citizenship quests. I typically try 
to max out my character on the Island of Refuge to get all the gear I 
can there before heading for the big city. Then, knowing I need to 
complete the citizenship quest before I can ding 7 and 8, I just pick 
the grey mobs to make killing them quick just to get the quest coins.
