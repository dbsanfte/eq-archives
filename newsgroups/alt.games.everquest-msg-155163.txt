Some suggestions:

DL (getting upper end of things though)
SolB (excellent xp)
Echo Caverns
Scarlet Desert
Dawnshroud Peaks (if you can get a group at the hopper caves)
Great Divide (if you're ready to pick a faction - Kromrif/Kromzek or
Coldain/CoV)
CoM
Tenebrous Mountains
specific camps in RM

Which one you will find good groups in will vary by server.
