I know this is a waaaaay long shot, but I figured I'd see if anyone
knows.  I've got VNC installed on my computer so I can access it when
I'm not at home.  Well, yesterday, I decided to use it to check on my
sales when my wife was out for a while and unfortunately, that crashed
EQ to the desktop.  And I tried several times to get back in and just
get it to where I was selling again, but I couldn't do it.  I kept
ending up at the desktop.  So I was wondering, is there any program out
there that will allow me to remotely access EQ?  I know there would be
way too much lag to actually fight or anything, but I would think I
could access the bazaar or chat and stuff.  So anyone know of any
program that works?
