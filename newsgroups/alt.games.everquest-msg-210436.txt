Ranger is the more versatile. Can pretty much solo easily from 30 onwards.
Tracking skills make quests/farming easier. Ability to snare and sow make
them desirable for pickup groups.

Warrior, erm...They're good at tanking. Lack of any spells or spell like
abilities means solo'ing isn't much of an option after 30, it can be done
and with your natural regen you'll at least have less down time compared to
other Warriors but it's still a lot of sitting on your ass.

TBH I can't think of a reason to play a Warrior, there is no shortage of
them and an excess of Warriors doesn't really help a raid. For groups they
are easily replaced by knight classes and if any of the comments from a
previous thread are anything to go by, are less wanted than Paladins or
Shadowknights. Rangers on the other hand, although there is no shortage of
them (and another LoTR movie will create yet more) their role in a raid is
damage dealer rather than taker they are not going to be hit with the same
problem of "do we really need another warrior?" and on top of that they are
great at absorbing DT's :ï¿½)
