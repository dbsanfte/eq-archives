Somehow, after weeks and weeks of not being able to sell a damned thing, 
my bazaar mule has unloaded most of the crap I've been collected over 
the last few months (I'm sure than many of those words and runes sold 
for a tenth of their worth... oh well).

So I've found myself burdened with the princely sum of almost 9kpp (
jokes about broke-ass Storm Wardens are tolerated, but I won't 
necessarily laugh along). I know about most of the old Druid items, but 
I'm woefully out of touch when it comes to newer (PoP and later) 
tradable Druid items, so all advice on good upgrades or cool toys (toys, 
in fact, preferred to upgrades, unless they are massive) is very much 
appreciated.

Here's Han's gear, for your amusement:
