I would like to compile a list of opposing factions (as in, KOS to each 
other) that share the same zone... I only have the following examples so 
far:

-Coldain vs. Giants in Great Divide, Eastern Wastes (inc. wolves of 
either faction)

-Scorpiki vs. Sarnak in Overthere (also Dragoons and other VS faction 
mobs)

-Goblins vs. Sarnak in Lake of Ill Omen

-Prisoners vs. Guards in Highhold Keep

These are obvious. There are a few more I suspect work, but haven't 
confirmed:

-Dark Elves vs. Halflings in Nektulos Forest?

-Recuso vs. Hands of Seru in Marus Seru?

-Goblins vs. Orcs in Misty Thicket?

-Drolvarg vs. Pilgrims in Firiona Vie?

-Giants vs. Wuoshi in Wakening Lands?

-Othmir vs. Bulthar in Cobalt Scar?

-Loda Kai vs. Vah Shir in Shadeweavers Thicket?

Anybody want to add more?
