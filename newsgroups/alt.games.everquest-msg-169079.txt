It seems like for less than $5000 you could host your own board.
I guess that is why EQ traders started doing that. This is all a greed
thing, ezboard wants to grow as a business but they price themselves
out of their customer's price range. They don't seem to get that most
of these are "hobbyist" sites and not businesses.

Although it is less organized, there is a free alternative:

Usenet ;)

Its funny but lots of the newer net people can't even fathom that
there is a place that every ISP hosts locally with millions of posts
a day and its all free, no matter how much traffic a group gets.
