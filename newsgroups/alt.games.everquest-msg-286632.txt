D then D.

Takes about half a second.  Less laggy than turning attack off.  Works 
instantly.  Do it before enrage.

Now's a good time to learn before you make it into Time when all of the 
trash will enrage.  Or before you ever go to Uqua where dying matters 
because you die it wipes your raid.

Grats on beating RC, it's a marathon event at any level.

Our monk solo'd the drops in Water for the oil.

The container is not no drop, most guilds make one or two and then just 
pass them around (it's not consumed in the combine).
