I dinged level 8 last night with my DE necro and went to buy my spells,
to discover that they were over 4 plat apiece.  Granted, this is the
first INT caster I've gotten above level 6 or so, but to me that seems
totally outrageous.  What non-twinked character has that money to spend
on spells?  Maybe I'm doing something wrong money-wise and should be
able to afford them, but otherwise it makes no sense to me.
