EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark -

I received it for Christmas, and honestly, even though I love computer
games, this one scares me.  My brother-in-law spends WAY too much time
on this game.

Anyway, it's still in an unopened box, never installed, never opened,
etc...  I prefer to trade for some recent title with good reviews, but
all offers are considered!

If you need references, or are afraid of being ripped off - I can
provide references through ebay or "used game trading zone".
