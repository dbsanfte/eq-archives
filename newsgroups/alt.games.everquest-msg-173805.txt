You want equal reward, when you don't put in equal effort and work.

You don't see a problem with that?

Being an officer of a high end raiding guild (using a merit system), I can
tell you that for us anyway,  sure "part-time" players may get items over
"hardcore" peeps.. everybody has to get paid..  but a part-time player will
NEVER get that item of complete uberness before a hardcore player.

Is that wrong?  I don't think so..  you want the best, you work for it.  You
want some upgrades, turn up whenever you log on..

You get out what you put in..

The primary focus of loot is to build and strengthen a guild, its NOT to
make you uber, or solo better, or show off to your friends... if you want to
grow and defeat bigger and badder mobs, you need a guild MA who plays
hardcore (whether you raid once a month or day, somebody who always make
them).. and you make sure he is well equipped first, to take you onto the
next level and stage.

You don't kill new mobs and get better loots by giving the new, best in the
guild BP to a warrior who will log on again in a months time
