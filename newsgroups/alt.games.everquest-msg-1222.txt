Aha, now I see.  Though why anyone would hunt bards I'll never know.
Well, I guess for the exp and the loot, but it still rubs me the wrong
way.  I do lecture people who I see camping bards (except for Ogres in
Feerrott, the bard attacks them in their home area, I guess it's
acceptable).  I wish you could help NPCs of your main class and
faction, but I can see how that would get out of hand, unless you only
hunted non-PC races.  As for stats, I guess it would be high AC (thick
skin) +cha and very +Resistant to Criticism.

Well, I've done about 24 hours (95% of 45) in Velious with only one
non-LD death.  I think this must be some sort of record for me.  I've
soloed, paired, grouped small and full, killed all sorts of stuff, and
still alive.  I kind of like hunting in places where I can have a
chance of running for my life and making it.
