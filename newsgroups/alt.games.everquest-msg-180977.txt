"Deliberate" implies some level of cognition concerning the looting. Some
people just don't *think* about it. Or, in a group of 6 with no formal
rotation it's easy to get the frequency of looting a little bit wrong and
not realise that somebody is missing out.

Heck, they're tanks, we didn't grab 'em for their brains. :-)

Basically it's possible to do things unthinkingly. While some NLers are
unrepentant, a fair proportion at least appear to show genuine regret.
