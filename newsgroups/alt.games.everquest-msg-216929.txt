When you see someone like that, do this.

1. Note their class.

2. Find someone you know of that class.  Have that person give you a link
to a great NODROP item that is for that class, and not usable by your class.
Best is if it is only usably by the lamer's class.

3. Act surprised to see the lamer, and tell them you are sorry that they
didn't contact you after whatever they left for obviously fell through,
because you could have used them.  This fantastic thing dropped (show them
the link), and there was no one there who could use it, so you had to
take it to clear the corpse, and are now going to have to destroy it,
since it is NODROP.
