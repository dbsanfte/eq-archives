Honestly, sometimes boring is a nice change of pace.

Pah! Are you trying to tell me that most plate tanks do xp groups
*without* slow?   It's like saying "yah, you can fight because you use
weapons! Try it without them!".  You'll have to try harder to burst my
bubble Frank. :)

*rub chin* I think I fought right inside the upstairs part of this room
once, in a corner.  I've been trying to remember where that was, because
as you say, HoH *is* boring, so different camps would help that a
little.  Also explains why the shrines are so often available but
basements are full...folks want the drops.

Tactics would be nice, but I haven't been on a successful Behemoth raid
yet, and I understand that if you do any of the quest methods to get the
flag, you cut yourself from progressing any further. If I understood that
correctly.
