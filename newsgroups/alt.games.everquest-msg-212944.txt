One combo that hasn't been mentioned was bard/wizard - but if you go to
Graffe's, you'd find widespread support for this one.  Bards are some of the
best pullers in the game; bard chant-kiting with wizard nukes will get you
to 29 easily.  After wizard hits 29, having the bard round up four mobs to
quad, let the wizard snare, then wizard and bard run together (bardspeed
quadding!).  The bard can finish off that last runner without wasting wizard
mana; if things get out of hand, bardspeed and snare means rounding the quad
back up to retry is a snap.  Bardic manasong will go a long way to alleviate
the wizard's medding.  Transportation is effortless, between ports and the
fastest running in the game.  When the bard starts swarmkiting, there's
nothing better than a wizard's burst damage for finishing off that last bit
of the former pet's health.

If you want to get away from the old tank/cleric combo, this one is as far
from it as you can get - fast, cool, unconventional, great XP, and should
you go so high - two of the most desired classes at raid levels.  I've
played this combo from both sides, and it's a blast!
