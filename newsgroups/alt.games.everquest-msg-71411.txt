Released = open?

Wonder how said friend was reading a box for something that hadn't been
released yet.  Neat trick, that.  I guess we'll have to assume he's psychic
or some such.

Even better, Luclin *still* hasn't been released yet I guess, since I have
other guildmates that are still unable to go out and buy it in their
countries, and according to your criteria that means we must all be playing
a figment of our collective imaginations.  :)
