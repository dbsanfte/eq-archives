Since I have named myself one of the two prophets mentioned in Rev. 11, here
is what I would like to see occur.

The only thing I ask is that I am able to finish my prophecy and testimony
using this channel which has opened for me. Here is what I plan to be the
main content of my 3.5 year message which God has chosen me to give so that
you would have every chance to follow him if you wish.

1) Full review of the 1611 King James version of the Bible as I am led by
God to reveal, which admittedly I have never bothered to read myself, lol.

2) Review of the daily news in the San Jose Mercury News

3) My own ideas

4) Breathing directed written fire on whomever I wish except for one person,
who is known, for any reason from my soon to be untouchable position.

5) I also plan on creating a musical document to go along with my written
document which will feature the best music ever made (basically metal, hard
rock and rap) in my judgement so that when I am gone by death or rapture in
the summer of 2006, then you will have something to give you some minor
solace if you are still here.
