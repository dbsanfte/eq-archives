Okay, I will avoid using any DoT spells then; I thought maybe there
were some DoTs that necros had, or that shamans get later, that didn't
do any damage that could be used, but I guess not.  I do have my
Disempower debuffing spell that I just got which doesn't do any damage
(just says "mob looks frail" when I cast it), and I'm sure I'll get
plenty more debuffing/slowing spells along the way.  

Another question:  That Disempower spell seems to get resisted a lot
when I cast it (probably because I just started using it).  If I cast
a debuffing type spell and the mob resists it, will the resisting
cause them to break out of the mez?
