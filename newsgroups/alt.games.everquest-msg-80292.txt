I did the same thing.  The basic game sat in my computer desk for
about six months - me afraid to open it because of its possible
ramifications.  I ended up opening it over the xmas holidays and yes,
life is over as I knew it.  

But, I disagree completely with the number 1 point below.  What
happened was we now own two copies (of every add-on!), two
subscriptions and two lives lost instead of one.  But we do have
plenty to talk about. <g>

I've also learned to ensure Campbell's Chunky Soups and Pizza Pockets
are well stocked so the teenager doesn't starve.  (mom, mo-om,
mo-omm!)
