James != LC Officer
James != All opinins and actions of LC as a guild

This discussion is not about James. It's about Lotus Cult.

This discussion is not about whether or not the "zerg guilds" should be
in the elemental planes. They already are.

This discussion is not about whether or not LC tried to stop them from
getting there for selfish reasons. If they did, they failed and the
point is now moot.

This is about LC going public and whining about somebody else doing
something in a way other than LC wanted to *order* them to do it, then
badmouthing them about it.  For a guild supposedly making so much of a
fuss about how much they worry about their reputation, and they want to
be seen as "the nice Uberguild", that's pretty damned contradictory.
