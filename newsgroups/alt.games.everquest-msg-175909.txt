Just a few...

1) Say I have 2 mobs close together. Can Dire charming one cause the other
to agro on me like other offensive spells.

2) If I DC say a Sarnak in loio, does it then keep the same faction as a
normal sarnak... ie will it agro any goblins it gets near, *or* does it get
my faction table and is therefor agro to both goblin and sarnaks.

3) Does anyone have any tricks or suggestions for getting a DC pet from the
ZI area in POV to past the castle bridge. Last time I tried my pet agrod
some undead which ended up summoning me. Summon companion doesnt seem to
work on DC pets.

4) Are there any good DC pts that regen or heal themselves. My pets always
regen so slowly, so soloing with DC isnt so practical. Been considering
training up bind wounds... sigh. Pity they dont regen like they do
uncharmed, or like the lvl 62 animation.
