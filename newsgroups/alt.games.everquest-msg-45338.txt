Probably a lot of good advise, but how does scamming work in practice?
Which idiot clicks the OK button if there is more then the to-be-traded
items in the trade window?
Doesn't the trade get cancelled automatically if one person goes linkdeath
during a trade?

I personally thought the trade system was pretty good. Haven't found any
problems with it yet.
