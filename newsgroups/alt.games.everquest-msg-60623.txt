It kinda sounds like you're not only primary healer but also primary crowd
controller.

Though any class with root can make a decent crowd controller, it's
generally a bad idea to give critters even MORE reason to hate you.  Have
someone else root...most casting classes get the spell in one form or
another.

Don't have another rooter?  Find another group.  Sounds like your puller is
a moron.
