But having a BardBot playing Selo's, the clarity type song and a MR
buff and what have you would still be better than not having it
regardless of the fact that occasionally each of the songs will drop
for a short time every now and then.

People bot other classes and don't do it as well as a person doing it
with their full attention.  BardBots probably will happen. 
(personally I don't think that bots are worth the extra monthly fee -
and doing a proper two-boxing seems like way too much hard work)
