I'm specialized in conjuration; from a RP standpoint, this makes a lot 
of sense to me, mages are, in my little gnome's opinion, defined by 
summoning and conjuration.

Back in the day, this made a lot of sense in terms of utility, too, as 
frequently conjuration were the best nukes, but more importantly, our 
best mana regeneration was via pet cannibalization, which meant that 
getting a discount on summoning the pets was a very big deal.

Now that pet canni has been killed (long since, I know, but its still 
sort of recent news to me), though, and now that bolts are useful for 
more than the occaisional "I want to impress people, and am willing to 
line up a clear LOS shot and risk someone blocking it in order to do 
that" bit of flash, or long distance pulling... well I wonder.

Whats the current thinking, evocation or conjuration?

I'm sure using Evocation a lot recently... that and whatever the healing 
one is called, almost tempting to take that, but in groups or raids that 
will be silly.
