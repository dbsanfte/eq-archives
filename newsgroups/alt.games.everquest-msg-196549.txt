I think people are missing my original point.

If SOE thinks this is happening, whether or not it is actually
happening, they will nerf KEI.  The poster I was responding to said
they would only nerf it in the unlikely event that someone could prove
its use an exploit.  I posted another possibility that would result in
KEI being nerfed.  Its widespread use is not an exploit, but SOE might
conclude that it is changing the way the game is played in a
detrimental fashion for many of its customers playing legitimately,
and they will not allow that to stand.

It's just an example.  I will acknowledge posting my own observations
that would lend credence to such a conclusion on SOE's part.
