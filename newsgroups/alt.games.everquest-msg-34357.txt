All true.

In fairness to Foamy, though, it seems to me, he is pointing out the
difference between a "threat", (as in your above examples), and a "hollow
threat", such as; "...if you don't behave, the bogeyman will come and take
you away".

Maybe it's all in the eye of the beholder. If you feel you are being
threatened, then you are. If you know for a fact that someone is incapable
of carrying through their threat, then you are not.

Or maybe not.
