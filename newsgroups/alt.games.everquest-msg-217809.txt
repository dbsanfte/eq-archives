According to the folks at eqtraders.com the worst case 'success' rate
for items you are already trivial at is about 66%, so I'm thinking you
have *not* kept close track or have not tracked enough samples to be
statistically meaningful.  Here's the page with the formulas.  These
guys know what they are talking about.

You can see that the lowest success rate possible for items just gone
trivial is when your skill is less than 68 (noob).
