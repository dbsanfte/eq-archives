Oh, man.... this just gets more and more unbelievable. The *only* people
who are getting their characters wiped are the ones who insist on
getting the prorated monthly fee back (here's your five bucks) and a
refund on their Luclin purchase. (Meaning they're quitting anyway.) For
anyone who "can't afford to upgrade their OS for a couple months) the
answer is what it's always been. Cancel your account now without asking
for a refund, eat the five dollar and sixteen cent loss on your December
payment, and when you can afford to upgrade to Win 98, re-start account
and your characters, equipment, etc. will be there loyally waiting for
you. And again, for the probably 1,000th time, if you really truly can't
afford to eat the five buck loss for part of December's playing fee, you
probably should be more concerned about making sure your kids have new
school clothes than playing at an expensive hobby like online computer
gaming.

(Krist onna Krutch, now I've opened the door for all of the "I *can*
afford the five dollars, but it's the *principle* of the thing"
whiners.)
