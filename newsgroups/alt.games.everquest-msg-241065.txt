Don't be silly! Why would Blizzard wait until completion before
unleashing their next steaming pile of shit on us!

It still baffles me, even knowing Blizzard and every previous
patch/expansion/problem that has occured, just why they unleashed a
bug-ridden uncompleted upgrade.

I doubt they will ever learn, sadly.

Honestly, I'd rather have new content with a bit of down time/bugs,
than a static unchanging world, with no down time/bugs. Thinking that
WoW will be completely bug free, seems to be wishfull thinking to me.
