Your video card is probably still your best bet.  More ram onboard, faster
video processor.  Even though memory for your computer is cheap, the return
for adding more memory rapidly diminishes above a certain level (dependant
on OS to a large degree).  For Win9x, I've heard that generally going over
128MB doesn't do much for you, just minor incremental improvements in
performance, for WinNT, I think it's more like 256MB.  For a game like EQ,
probably the most important factor, is the video card, both the amount of
memory, and speed of the components on the card.  Another important factor
would be how fast you can transfer data to the video card, so an AT bus card
would not be a good choice, AGP 4x, or some of the new PCI stuff coming out
would be good choices.
