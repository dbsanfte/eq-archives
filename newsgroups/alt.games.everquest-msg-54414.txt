While you pose an interesting question that others are argueing, I want
to point out a possible flaw in your thinking.

You can't switch in the bracer for a snare or fear.

Your current mana pool tops out at your max mana, based on wis and +mana
items.

If your current mana is less than your max mana, then it gradually
refills up to that point, one tick at a time, rate at which it does so
is based on whether you are sitting, medding, standing, and have
clarity type effects on or not.

Lets say you have a wisdom giving you 200 mana max.

If your current mana is 100, and you put on a +1000 mana item, guess
what your current mana becomes?  100.  Not one iota more.  You just
have 100 mana of 1200, which looks like less but isn't.

Lets get even trickier.  You've got your +1000 mana item on, but want
to swap in one that is +2000 mana.  Your current mana is 600.  Whats
your final mana?  If you guessed 600, you are wrong.  200.  You took
off the +1000 mana item, your current mana dropped to max at 200,
then you put on the one that took your pool to 2200, so now you have
200 of 220, which looks worse, and is (but not as much worse as it looks)

Swapping mana and wisdom items on and off your body will never give
you more mana when you need it, at best you will break even, at worst
you will lose mana.

Now if you do this situationally, as someone else suggested (wear one
bracer when grouped, another when soloing) it works fine, since you
will always be medding back up to full before pulling, presumably.
