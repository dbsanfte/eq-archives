Like I said above, in my fangs+GMU parses I did have avater up all the time
(<3 pocket shamans)

It doesnt change the fact that my class (on a HIGHER combat table than
rangers), using the 2 best weapons in Luclin, multiple armour slots with
Aurora of Battle or Vengance, over 160 points of aa improvements, and a
pocket shaman (casting avater) can be bettered (or at leach matched) with 40
or so AA skills and an "ok" bow from a whole expansion prior.

Oh but archery is situational!!  Well im sorry, but taking a little care to
not corner mobs does not make up for the ungodly and over-powering damage
that EQ/AM3 provides.

That doesnt even go into the other benefits archery offers, such as zero
chance of self-damage versus melee mobs, ability to hit a mob from outside
its AE range (ungodly versus cursed, seru, A'D, HoH dragon, the dudes in the
agnarr chain, etc etc...

Nerf rangers!
