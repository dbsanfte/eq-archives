CAN they? Probably by scanning your computer (I'm not a coder geek) but
they've semi-promised not to do that.  I imagine there's ways of doing it
without scanning, but they're too busy working on SoL to program anything
else.

You're driving through a school zone with the lights flashing, and the law
states in no uncertain terms that the speed limit is 15 when the lights are
flashing.  You're going 85 miles an hour.  If no cop is around, is it still
wrong?
