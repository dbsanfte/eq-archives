Subject: Re: Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the life: no one can come to the Father(God)(in Heaven), but by me." (John 14:6) This means that if you die without trusting in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour you will die in your sins and be forever separated from the love of God in a place called Hell. The Holy Bible descibes Hell as a place of eternal torment, suffering, pain and agony for all those who have rejected Jesus Christ. The good news is that you can be sure you are going to Heaven when this life is over if you allow Jesus Christ to save you today. Do not wait until later to be saved because you do not know exactly when you will die. [ Posted by: RonaldGrossi3852@yahoo.com on May 14, 2005 ] [ 3:16:50 pm ]
