Is it just me, or now after the patch does zoning take 4 - 5 X longer?
Before when  zoned, it would take about 15 - 20 seconds to load the new
zone, now it seriously takes ~ 90, it is so painfully slow to move about now
I don't get it.  To top it off, when I to zone sometimes, all the npcs,
players and monsters look like they're levitating about 20 feet off the
ground until I move closer to them, they gradually lower.

My system is a celeron 500
320mb of ram
Direct X 8.1
GEForce 2mx/400 (12.41 display, used to use detonator drivers but eq stopped
working)
