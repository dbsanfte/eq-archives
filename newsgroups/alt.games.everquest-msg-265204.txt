I'm level 61, and I finally got the last of my resists to 100 or more.
It's possible to do it at level 45, but if you had that kind of gear,
you wouldn't need the mask.

However the answer to your question, is it eventually becomes
important to focus on the resists offered by the equipment you get as
much as it is the other stats. Particularly if you intend to raid,
having high resists is important. However with the number of one
groupable targets these days that have nasty DoTs and AoEs that you'd
like to avoid and also many mobs cast fear, so that's nice to resist.
(It's really embarrassing when a green fears you.)

The best way to get a specific resist up is with augments. (Though the
magic ones tend to be hard to come by) Otherwise you should start to
focus on equipment with resists on it. (Honestly it won't be come
important to you for a number of levels.) To combat this particular
menace though, find a Enchanter willing to cast Magic Resist buff on
you to resist the Fear, and find a Shaman to cast a Poison/Disease
resist on you to resist the DoTs.
