Shroud is now kinda replaced by the-not-really-anywhere-as-good Lungi of
the Forbidden (woot SMR).  Smolder is junk now.  Salindrite and SoD no
equivalents but better (sometimes much) found elsewhere.  Dainty Gloves,
ROFL.  Dwarf Mask > Gnome Mask.  

Prismatic much more common than Primal ever was, some *gasp* stuff for Int
and Wis casters and an assortment of other nice enough bits which often
drop 3 and 4 at a time.

On balance since the last revamp Sleeper being awake is no great disaster
unless you really, really wanted a Shroud in which case you should have got
your wannabe-uber arse in gear a whole lot sooner.
