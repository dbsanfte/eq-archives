Another thing to keep in mind about harvesting: there are a finite number of
nodes allowed in a given zone, and sometimes different node spawn points are
linked, so that if there is an unharvested node at X, the node spawn point
at Y will not respawn.

So, if you just care about, say, mining, it is still a good idea to harvest
other nodes.  On one of the forums, a developer responded to someone asking
why they could not find many nodes of a particular type in a particular
zone, and the developer checked--no one was fishing there, and so most of the
allowed nodes were schools of fish.
