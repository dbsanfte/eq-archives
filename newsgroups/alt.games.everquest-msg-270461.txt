I had the same problem, they are in the Ruins and the Sunken City by the
docks only, most are down deep and you will be safest using a spell or
summoned item and swimming down to them. I was told East Freeport by someone
but spent ages looking and must assume that fish have been removed from
there now.

At least with the changes you only need 20 skill to move out into the
commonlands where fish are much more plentiful. Hope this helps you out.
