Guests in the isreali house? that's some horrible treatment for guests then.
How about NOT violating their human rights (set forth by the U.N.).
The Palestinians are simply reacting to the injustice commited by Isreal...
sure, its not the best way to react, but it is a reaction to the murder of
1000+ palestinians and the oppression of many more.  Reread my reply to one
of your previous posts.

"drinking their blood"?  enough with the blind preaching..  you're lacking
when it comes to evidence/reasoning..
here's mine -  www.amnesty.org
