Which were also better when Tae was grouping.  Shhh, let's not let out 
the secret that EMarr has suddenly become a haven for those sick of 
stupid people.

Oh wait, there was that cleric who came to HHK last night, ran down to 
WR, saw us, ran down to RR, found - surprise! - a full room of raiders 
happy to great him, screeched "TRAIN!" (well, it's better than most do), 
and made it ALL the way back to the top of the stairs near the WR before 
dropping dead.

A fairly frequent occurence (only usually without the warning), and yet 
I still ask - WHY do so many people do that?
