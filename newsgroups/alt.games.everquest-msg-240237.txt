Unless the higher levels bring a twink and let the twink loot the
fabled gear... As the post you replied to suggested they do. Also some
people kill them for fun and give the gear to random passersby - more
so with the easier ones than those that take a group or more of high
level players.

I don't think there is much of a drop in population, if any, but ever
more of the population is at the maximum level, I suspect, so unless
you are also there, the game seems ever emptier. That's how it seems
to me, anyway, on The Tribunal which is at least a fairly old server
even if it wasn't around from the start.
