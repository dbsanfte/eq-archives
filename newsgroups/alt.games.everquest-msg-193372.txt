I believe what they fixed was that the aggro from the DS was messed up.  It
was counting as damage done by the person wearing the DS but the aggro was
being assigned to the caster.  I found this out the hard way with my druid
in a PoN group.  Now that it is fixed, the aggro control of tanks is insane.
Not to mention the powerleveling that you can do.  Only bad thing about that
is that it was a pain to get a camp in Paludal for a few days after the
change.  Now it's died off to the powerlevelrs sticking to the back areas
like usual.
