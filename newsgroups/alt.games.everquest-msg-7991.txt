Personally I like the Ogre for the Shaman class.  I have played all of
the shamanistic races to lvl 20 and the Ogre is the one I have the
most fun with.  Sure you are KOS to alot of places but that is easily
fixed.  The extra STR and STA give you great loot carrying capacity
and hit points.  Wis is not great but can easily be raised with the
right Items.  I am 38th lvl now with 1087 hp unbuffed, a 138 Wisdom
and have been to every continent in Norrath :)  I am having a blast.
On the plus side with Alchemy you can make shrink potions which can be
used indoors and out so Size no longer really is an Issue.
