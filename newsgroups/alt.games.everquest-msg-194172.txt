Thats about 90% of my bardic play time.  You can bet I don't solo by head to
head melee, thats for sure!


I mem:

Healsong
Snare
DOT
DOT
DOT
DOT
Invis
Charm

and use TBoots to stay faster than the mobs plus SS Boots to stay airborn to
avoid certain terrain features, if necessary.

I generally approach mobs, charm one in a way that pulls a couple more along
with.  I try to get all the mobs on my pet, and put SS Bracer DS on him for a
little extra fun.  If successful, I then twist 4 DOTs on his target till charm
breaks or he's almost dead, in which case I twist in invis to break charm.  I
may put charm on a new mob or I may not depending on damage rates; at any rate
I end up getting chased around some and chant kiting at least one of the mobs
till it runs, often my pet is fighting one mob while I'm chanting another in
circles around them.  Sometimes I can slap snare on a mob so that my pet can
get its attention, sometimes not.

I get hit a few times in most any pull, if its less than a quarter of my HP
down I pretty much ignore it.  If its more than that, I twist in heal for a
few cycles, which admittedly reduces my DOT output by a quarter or so for the
few cycles it takes to get back up to comfortable levels.  Of it seems
important I can also swap in a lute fairly easily on the beat and keep drums
up most of the time for the DOTs, sometimes I don't bother if I'm serious
about the charm part since I'm already juggling a wind instrument.

Look at the math again, though.  Compare regen 1 (10 hp per minute) to
Healsong (36 hp per 18 seconds no lute, 66 hp per 18 seconds with newbie
lute)  Or better, compare to 120 hp per minute without or 220 hp per minute
with, if that math is easier to handle.

How much can it really matter?

Mobs I'm fighting hit for a couple hundred HP a shot.  Look again at 10 hp per
minute.  Am I really going to be fighting long enough between "oops" moments
to heal even one blow up from regen?  Now at 220 hp per minute, yes, I can
reasonably expect a couple minutes before the next time I get swatted.

How about after the fight?  Well at 250 hp per minute (song with lute plus
natural regen) I can pretty much crack my knuckles, have a few sips of coke,
say something in guild chat, and then get back to my next pull.  Regen will
stack on top of that of course, making it.... 260 hp per minute.  Hardly a
noticable difference.

On the other hand, look elsewhere in this thread for a long detailed list of
why I feel Run (and especially Run 1) is the greatest AA in the first tier
list, with especial attention to a bard's needs.

If you rely on Selos' for your speed, you have to ditch one of the 8 songs
from my lineup.  Which is it?  Without Charm you can't charm or swarm kite at
all.  Without Invis you end up losing some pets which die before charm breaks,
so you get no exp.  Without Snare you end up having a hard time forcing mobs
to fight your pet, unless you have a lot of running room (Selos does give you
an edge there over TBoots, IF there's room) and will have a lot of trouble
with your last mob running off and getting adds.  Ditch one of the DOTS and
you take a quarter of your potential damage output when chanting, and
eventually you -are- going to be down to one last mob, frequently not all that
injured if you kill more than two at a time.  Ditch the healsong and you are
throwing away 220 hp per minute healing potential.

TBoots (or JBoots) for speed aren't nearly as bad, but you do still have to
keep clicking them, and there's some annoyance over inventory needed to do
this, basically it adds in some juggling or costs potential loot space and
hotkey space. Run 3 does the same job as the boots, only you never ever have
to click em or worry where they are, they never run out, and they work indoors
and out and can't be dispelled.

How you can compare Run to Regen with any hope of saying its a tossup is, as
I've demonstrated, very difficult for me to understand.

Llyric

ps: this is where you either stop posting to this thread as a defacto
surrender, or make a detailed case countering my arguements.  Please don't
just say "the extra regen is definately worth it."  You are defending the
proposition singingcat made that "There are only 2 choices here to start off
with.  Run 1 or Regen 1  Everything else as a bard is pointless to start."
(which implies that Run and Regen are of equal utility)

Or else you are agreeing with me that Run is vastly better than Regen, but
that Regen is perhaps the best of the remaining first tier AA's.  If its
"debatable when to take it" then this means that you might take some other AA
first, or perhaps that you'd take other first second, even third or POP level
AAs first and then go back and get regen much later.  Maybe thats it, you mean
that after buying every useful AA you can think of at 65 would be the point
where you'd deign to put points into regen.  Not a very strong argument in
favor though, if that's what you had in mind.

To my way of thinking, you only put 6 points total into first tier AA, because
thats the most you have to put in in order to get the second and third tier
ones.  Since they are (exception Run) so generally lame, you wouldn't waste
your time on -any- of the first tier ones you don't have to.  So the question
is not "in what order would you take regen" but "would you take regen or one
of the others," or perhaps "only one or two points in regen leaving two or one
point for one of the others"

Or there's some other point you are making here which I'm missing entirely,
because those are the only potential ones I can think of.
