Hate is nerfed. It used to drop lots of cashstuff (and planar armor for the
turnins) but since the revamp cash and pp have been minimal. Not even 10% of
the pp of old Hate :(.

PoG is also restored with the damn zone-wide aggro protectors so farming
there for pp is not a good idea.

Seb is king in a constant flow of cash. Jail and NG (Necrosis Scarab +
Guardian something) yield 1k+ per hour easy. Disco and chef are harder but
still worthwhile for plain pp farming.

If you don't mind spending some real time to farm you should try finding
some hotspots of items which sell good. I won't mention locations but a
druid friend of mine can literally farm a spot for on average 15k per 2
hours (low is ~5k, max about 25k). Just ganking nameds that drop stuff that
sells good.
He's also bound near the seb entrance and farms the fungi king if he's
studying or somesuch. A fungi or two per week is not bad for semi-afk
farming :).
