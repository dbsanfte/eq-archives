One other thing, I have NO problem buying items.  Generally speaking,
I'd rather do that than sit on my ass for hours at a time at a single
spawn point waiting for an item to drop.  Best money I ever spent in
EQ was for my GEBS.

Getting plat for me is a damned site easier than camping.  Granted,
all those level appropriate people are going to be getting less exp
from Hill Giants as I kill the hell out of them.
