Ah, I take it you never had the displeasure of experiencing Sierra's "Red
Barron II" several years ago.  It easily beats out Daggerfall for unplayable
bugginess.
You can fly most individual missions, but even after the patches, you could
never fly the campaigns (and building a career through the campaign mode was
the main way the game was supposed to be played!)
At least in Daggerfall, you could develop a character and keep him/her, if
you saved game often enough.  In RBII, nothing you could do short of
re-writing the program would help.
