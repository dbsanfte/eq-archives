Honestly, this problem has been around for ages and I don't think I've ever
seen an EQ support person give an honest answer to what causes it.  I had
this problem constantly over dialup, thru internet connect sharing.  I
thought it was an internet connect sharing problem.  Then, I did an upgrade,
and the problem went away.  I used to have win98 on my machine, and a
standalone machine with win98se doing inet sharing.  Now I have windows XP
on both boxes, and I upgraded video to a Geforce2 MX400.  The problem has
disappeared, so it has to be either the OS, or the v3 driver.  My sister
plays EQ (win98) with a V3-2000 and she gets server screen bumps on most
zones too, going through inet sharing.
