OK.  Just for you.  Sony will have a server that never gets the upgrades or
bug fixes.  That should mean total up time.  Of course, it would not ever
get Kunark, Velious or Luclin or even Stonebrunt or Paineel, for that
matter.

I pay just like you.  I understand a little downtime.  As it stands, up time
is over 95% in the last month (they lose 3% for the last day).  That's a
pretty good record for an organization tha is constantly upgrading content
as well as fixing bugs.  I have been involved in the creation of software
that was installed at a large military site and the maintenance of it.  I
know how difficult it is to maintain that percentage of up time during the
work day (let alone 24/7).

Personally, I was able to do something else yesterday (besides work, you do
know what that is, right?).  And no, I don't look at it as handing over $.50
each month because there was (what 30 hours) downtime, I look at it as
paying $9.95 for the other 710 hours (or so)
