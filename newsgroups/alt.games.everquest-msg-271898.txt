As an enchanter I normally start off with the tank as my target.  When
we've got incoming I hit my /assist key to pick up the puller's
target, and then use the next NPC key to pick up a mez target.

When the group is coordinated, I can do this fast enough that I
sometimes get the mez off before the add is at our camp.
Unfortunately it really requires some group coordination and
particularly at the low levels you get get people who are freaked out
by multiple mobs and start swinging at everything in sight, or you get
the tank changing targets and breaking mez.

I never appreciated how critical it was for tank to STAY ON ONE TARGET
until I played an enchanter to tanks who switched.  About the only
time it's appropriate to switch is when the chanter calls out that a
target can't be mezzed.
