I am having 2 problems involving the buying of spells.

1) I have a level 9 Iksar Beastlord & I can't find the warder spells. Do
they sell these spells someone else than in the guild "house"?

2) My druid can't find the imbue emerald spell & ensnaring root spell. I was
told the cleric & enchanter guilds in Felwithe, but can't seem to find it.

Would appreciate the help
