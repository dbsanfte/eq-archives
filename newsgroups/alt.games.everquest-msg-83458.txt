Uh, no, that's not proof. That's minor evidence. For it to be proof of
'most', you'd have to name all the people involved in EQ at the start,
name all the ones who have left, and specify their actual reasons for
leaving.

You see now why I say you're speculating?

And frankly, he's right. If they did what the general population of
gamers asked for, EQ would very probably be an unplayable, un-fun
mess.
