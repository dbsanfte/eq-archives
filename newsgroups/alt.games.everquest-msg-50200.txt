    Her Runed Circlet is also an exception (or whatever that 4 INT/WIS chain

have an Ice Burrower Silk Swatch in the bank if I'm feeling lucky.....

    Those would be neat, too, but that's not quite what I'm getting at.
Examples: her Blackened Crystalline Robe gives INT, and CR, and MR (and
CHA - it's a nice robe). Her Kunzar Cloak gives INT, and a relatively high
AC, and FR. Her Bracelets of Woven Grass and Braided Cinch Cord give INT,
and HPs. That's what I'm looking for - items that combine CHA with some
other attribute that you want as well, rather than pure CHA items.

    If you want another item with CHA and INT, look on your face -
Incandescent Mask is one of the best Sol Ro quest items going.

    Most ENCH-specific armour does, like PoH gear and Velious quest armour.
The stats on the Hate headpiece are just nuts - IIRC 20 CHA and 8 INT.

    Might be 39 - I have all the 34 spells in my pack except the two she has
yet to research, and I don't remember Insight or Brilliance being there.
There is a CHA upgrade, though - looking forward to that.

>faction...let someone else kill these guys).

    For those slots I'm running Electrum Black Sapphire Earrings, Drakescale
Leggings (they also get her HIE DEX up to 75 on the nose for weapon
training), Crystalline Webshield. Actually, let me list my gear and you can
critique - it's heavy on defense, and I'm actually putting that to good use
right now (pulling to the kitty fort in Stonebrunt Mountains where AoE stuns
can NOT be used - more on that later).

2 x Electrum Black Sapphire Earring, Incandescent Mask, Runed Circlet, Loam
Collar.
Gold Fire Wedding Ring, Plat Fire Wedding Ring, 2 x Bracelet of Woven Grass,
Gatorscale Sleeves, Incandescent Gloves.
Embroidered Black Mantle, Kunzar Cloak, Blackened Crystalline Robe, Braided
Cinch Cord, Drakescale Leggings, Golden Efreeti Boots.
Rod of Insidious Glamour, Crystalline Webshield, Sarnak Ceremonial Dagger.

    Self-buffed, running 800 HPs, 500 AC, 160-ish INT and 150-ish CHA, level
31. Mana can get low when giving full haste to a tank-heavy group, but
otherwise seems to hold fine. Resists are mostly crap, STR is a minor issue.
Items that I've earmarked for change in the near future are the Circlet (to
Frog Crown? Crystal Chitin Circlet?), Collar (NO idea where to go here),
Gold Fire ring (to one of those Velk's spider rings), Bracelets (GCBs if
cash allows), and Dagger (Seal of Thoridain - time to get cooking!) I'm also
unhappy with the gloves, but INT caster gloves are Impskin or bust, so
they'll do. She should soon have the cash to buy any and all of these
upgrades, because she hunts in Stonebrunt.

    Yep, Stonebrunt is a cash mine. And she's not even doing Kobolds for
fine steel. Nope, she groups with a SHM and DRU and pulls high blue - yellow
trash to the kitty fort to rot. So where is the cash coming from? Well,
those trash animals have the pre-planar gems table as their loot table.
That's right, a mob the same level as those Tumps and Braes in Frontier
Mountains is dropping Sapphires, Fire Emeralds, and the other pre-planar
loot. And the merchants in the kitty fort aren't too greedy - I can get 81
pp for an Opal Bracelet from one. So far, the pandas seem to drop the most
cash items - as I get more experience I'll see who drops what.

>Right there that's ...errr...
>30 CHA I think.  And, as someone else posted, but I suspect is right, CHA
>doesn't have THAT much affect on mezzing anyway.

    From what I saw in Sebilis, CHA over 200 has a marked effect on mezzing,
and high CHA reduces fail rates against mobs that would normally be
difficult for that enchanter to mez. For normal, everyday "here's another
dar knight" situations I imagine no difference would be seen in the 150 to
190 CHA range as to failure rates.
