I've never really played a pet class character, so I don't fully
understand what is required to gain experience when fighting
a creature with your pet.  Do I have to out-damage my pet ?
Or simply get the killing blow?

I ask because I've been wanting to play around with some of
my druid's charm animals spells.  I know they aren't traditional
pets, but do charmed pets work the same way as regular pets
with regards to commands and experience sharing?

If someone could offer a URL that might have some info on
fighting with charmed pets, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks in advance,

Moriarty
