It is weak in comparison to a 7.5k heal, which is the context of
my statement.

Because you'd take a Shaman already before the incomplete heals came
out, slowing the mobs reduces their damage output and is worth more
than the more powerful Cleric heals or the Druid DS.

Druids are better at killing than healing, but a Cleric with UHOF and
Yaulp V can outdamage a Paladin and still keep a group healed, which
is quite frankly the height of absurdity.

Personally, when I'm choosing groupmates I tend to choose people I
like and don't give a damn how "efficient" their class supposedly
is.  And regardless of a class's nominal capabilities, a strong
player with a weak character is worth a whole lot more than a
mediocre player with a strong character.  If you're building groups
solely "by the book" then heaven help you if you have an encounter
that's actually challenging.  And if you don't have any challenging
encounters then why don't you just scrawl "I WIN" on your monitor
with a grease pencil and go do something useful or interesting?

Best way I know of to get invited into groups is to start one with a
friend or two and go on from there, there're only six slots in a group
but there are 14(?) character classes, who the hell are you to say
that one particular class should be preferred of any/all others in a
group?

There is <no> class advantage sufficient to outweigh player strength,
even in the "bad old days" of the hybrid exp penalty and "broken"
hybrids and Rogues a well played Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, or
Rogue was worth more than a mediocre anything, and lots more fun to
be around.

Yep :)
