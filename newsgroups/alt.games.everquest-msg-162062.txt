Rough but not debilitating. Like druids, root is just a convenience
for kiting rangers not a necessity.

I was more worried they were going to nerf EQ (the ranger EQ, not the
game) out of existance or something.

Not that I play my ranger anymore. But I would hate to have her
nerfed, playing or not!
