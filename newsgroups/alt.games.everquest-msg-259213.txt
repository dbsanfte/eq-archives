Hi all;
   I just wanted to introduce myself and tell everyone how helpful this
group has been since I discovered it a few days ago.
   I just began playing EQ and have a Lev 6 Kitty BL on Cazic-Thule who goes
by the name of Shierra. I prefer to level slowly and enjoy the game rather
than power level so I've been doing all the starter quests...although the
buggies are starting to irk me...I need 3 more carapaces for
frostweaver....*sighs* The bugs are all green to me now...so I don't even
get EXP for them...I butchered them for an hour tonight in Shadeweavers and
got nothing but 1 mandible which I didn't even need...I am definitely
looking forward to having a pet to help me out...

  But anyway..I'm headed to bed now...looking forward to getting to know
everyone and any tips, etc would be appreciated....

 Anyone playing on CZ feel free to shoot me a tell...I'd love to meet ya
:)

                                       Shierra
