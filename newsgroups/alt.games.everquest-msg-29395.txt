I believe they were setting bait at one point for ShowEQ users - 
spawning an invisible, non-agro mob in the zone and seeing who was 
running up to it.
Assuming you were smarter than to indiscriminately (and uncanningly) 
locate every new spawn, and you didn't run directly up to these 
invisible mobs and you didn't incriminate yourself by mentioning ShowEQ 
in some way then they can't prove you are cheating.

The most they can do is to switch the encryption mechanisms regularly 
enough that ShowEQ users are frequently hobbled. The ultimate sanction 
would be to prevent EQ working through IP masquerading boxes but that 
would be an extremely unpopular and suicidal action.

Personally I think such software to be more trouble and risk than it's 
worth though I imagine it can be a real timesaver if you're trying to 
powerlevel a character.
