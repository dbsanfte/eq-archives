Aye - mis-read the first statement. Someone left a 't' off the word AT

If you're exploring, get that ol Sense Heading bit maxed out, turn on your
log file, invis yourself, and start running hitting /loc at each turn
followed by a sense heading. You can rather quickly record a fairly
detailed layout that you can then parse / print / map out at your
leisure. Not as easy, more time consuming, but if you're serious about
exploring a new zone, that's the way to do it.
