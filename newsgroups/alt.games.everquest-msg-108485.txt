ROFL.  I got jumped by a siren somewhere when I was out pulling tac strikes
on barracudas for livers for the rough silver chain quest, Stun, dot,
charm... wait... break charm, stun, dot, stun, nuke, charm(resist), then I
finally got gate through the stuns and nukes.

All I could see is a rock surrounded by water with 2 or 3 sirens on it and a
big rock pillar behind that that I remember having a bunch of blue runes on,
but I think it was just the SS tower.
