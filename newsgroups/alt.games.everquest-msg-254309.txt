Well, since a long ago patch, most DOTs cast by a player stack with the 
same DOTs cast by other players (exceptions being DOTs that also debuff, 
which makes bard DOT stacking impossible).  Since the best damage output 
from a necro comes from casting a series of DOTs rather than from 
nuking, I imagine the problem would be that with a raid sized number of 
people including several necromancers, druids, and shaman, that the 
limit of 30 debuffs could be easily reached, preventing additional 
necromancers from contributing to the fight in their most effective way.

On the other hand, it could be something less obvious, like when a mob 
gets more than 30 debuffs it drops the infamous pink bunny fur slippers, 
clicky breeze item wearable only by necromancers.
