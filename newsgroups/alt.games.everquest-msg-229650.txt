Definitely not suffering from lack of horsepower.

That's about normal.  And that mouse thing is the reason I suggest you

There's still a longer startup time than just starting up one EQ, but it
shouldn't be nearly as bad with eqwindows, especially if you don't bother
using the patch program (built in option in eqwindows to skip it easily).

I find the responsiveness of EQW, plus lack of side issues (like losing the
mouse), to make it a much better option.  I actually use eqwindows when I'm
running a single instance usually to let me get at my web browser and such.

Not with eqwindows.  With regular EQ you can switch windows and then switch
back to fullscreen, but not sure how well that will work in practice.
