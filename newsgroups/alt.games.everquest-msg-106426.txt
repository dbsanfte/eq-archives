	With nominal precautions, it is possible for any caster to fight without
getting hit.  This means not taking chances and retreating as soon as a fight
starts to go south but it can be done.  The only class that would really have
a problem trying it is probably the Enchanter.

	And a Mage.  (My ENC and WIZ are still in single digits.)

|faster with lots of mana, you just go longer between meds.

	Mana is the life blood of a caster.  Casters can't do anything without it
(except for a few rclick items like Lumi Staff).  No mana = no power.  More
mana = more power.

|What would really make casters twinkable is reasonable mana regen

	They don't need it.  And if they want it, "/ooc PAYING for Clarity, will
come to you!"

|Maybe we just have different ideas of what a real twink is. My
|favorite twink is totally decked, fungal tunic, CoF, velious armor
|etc.

	You're talking about items that 95% of the toons old enough to obtain
legitmately don't have, never mind the twinks.

|My enchanter is also in darn good gear - good enough for 215 int
|and numerous hp items. 

	Depending on level, you will probably do better to lose INT items for pure
mana items.

|However, my enchanter could not solo
|appreciably faster than an untwinked one could - somewhat safer, but
|not faster. My ranger, on the other hand....

	Your ENC can already solo as fast or faster than the fighter, so what is
the point?  The argument is disingenuous.

|It increases what they are capable of handling but it *doesn't*
|appreciably improve the speed in which they level. Not to the extent
|twinking the hell out of a melee does.

	They are ALREADY faster than the fighters, and remain so even if you drop
the most broken items possible on the fighters.

	I saw what happened when a guild Druid got his hands on a Lumi -- shall we
include that in the discussion?  Or how about the level 11 one who got to 20
just as his KEI wore off?
