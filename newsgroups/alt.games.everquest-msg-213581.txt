I don't know much about PoS but I believe the frogs are the mob of
choice for soloers since they don't summon.  Still, at 60, they are a
little high level I *think*.

As for PoV, get a level or two, then you can grab the NE camp and pull
golems.  I don't think you will want to do any fearing, don't even
know if you can fear them.  What you can do is probably turn off pet
taunt and aggro kite them.  There is room and if you are careful you
won't get adds.  You can also try this at one of the CY camps (don't
know why they are called CY since that isn't a courtyard, but the two
camps to the right and left of the stairs after you cross the bridge).
 You have less kiting room but it can be done.  Another thing I have
done with my Ranger is to grab a golem and kite him back up on to the
sky bridge.  Once again, I don't know about fearing...if they path
back along the bridge this may work very well.  But I have found it
very easy to arrow kite on the bridge so it is worth experimenting.

Your main problem in the golem camps will be those damn unsnareable
spiders.  If you are lucky, no one will be at the OC camp (outer
cave).  This is prime kiting territory if that is your game.  Once
again, fear kiting is probably a bad idea.  Put up DMF and start
grabbing fiends and pulling them back across the water.  There is
plenty of room to work there.

However you are 60.   Hmmmm, at 60, in PoV, you may be able to find a
larvae camp along the hillside.  But if you venture out far from the
hillside near the GY, you will run in to these nasty unsnareable
skeletons.  Stay away from frogs, at least some of them are
unsnareable and they would be a tough single pull.
