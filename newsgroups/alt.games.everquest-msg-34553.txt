Our guild have a god rep, and would hate to loose it. If someone did that in our
guild the person would at the very least get a warning and we would keep an eye
on her.

We had a guy begging for stuff in both guild and in WC, and 20 min later i meet
him, wearning nice stuff. He got a big warning, only because noone gave him
anything. If anyone had given him anything, and it turned out he had better
stuff, he would be kicked immediately.
