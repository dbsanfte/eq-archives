My ranger was born in Surefall and raised in Qeynos.  This must be a *personal*
thing.  I've spent so much time in the Qeynos hills that I'm really just SO
bored with them.  As a druid, I buy all the ports eventually.  It's just a
matter of time and money.  
It's one of the group ports I'd buy first.
