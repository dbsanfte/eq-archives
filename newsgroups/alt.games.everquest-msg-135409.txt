Why? Never attacked you personally, don't plan on attacking anyone else.

Did some clarifying of my views. See, that's the thing, Wizz (may I call you
Wizz?) and I are two different people from 2 different backgrounds so we
will naturally look at things from a slightly different angle. By raising
questions and concerns, and then having the other person clarify them we can
both gain a better understanding of what the other is saying. In the process
we can also learn more about view, issues, and possibly even ourselves.  We
may even change our views slightly.  An open exchange where views are
shared, and clarified when needed, does that.
