But the city has an obligation to provide a safe environment for its 
citizens. Perhaps, just perhaps, EQ has an obligation to ensure its 
members are not harmed while using its services too, even if not 
directly by the services.

A movie theatre can be liable if you break a leg there, [even if your an 
idiot fucktard who can't figure out the bright orange crush puddle on 
the floor is wet without a sign],... why not a virtual environment if 
you lose your mind there? [even if your an idiot fucktard who can't 
figure out that you should turn it off when its time to go to 
school/work/have a life]
