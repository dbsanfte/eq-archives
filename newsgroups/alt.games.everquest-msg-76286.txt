Hm... Could you explain to the us exactly what makes you so unhappy
about the Stein of Moggok? It's one of the most awesome caster items you
can get anywhere, both relative to its (non)rarity, and in absolute
terms.

The only reason I can think of is looks, but then again, offhand items
don't tend to look cool at all, with the notable exception of the
Harvester.
