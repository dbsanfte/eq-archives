If you are planning to raid the city of mist and kill Lord Ghiosk I would
like to be able to loot the three books he drops for my shaman quest. I can
provide all shaman buffs to the entire raid.

Feel free to email me the date or send me a tell in EQ ANYTIME you see me -
I will port over immediately!

Some have mentioned that five mage pets from lvl 55+ mages take him out
fairly quickly.
