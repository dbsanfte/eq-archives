While what you say is true, it doesn't do the job David is looking for,
that of eliminating money and goods from the economy.  Since that
cash is going to players, who are looting the bone chips off an unending
supply of skellies, you aren't getting rid of it at all.  Rather, the price
of bone chips goes up as more and more people are willing to pay
more than the other guy in order to get them.

What he is looking for is a way to dump some of the accumulated
cash and items out of the system, in order to keep the value more
stable on the wealth that remains.

The one direct cash for exp quest I can think of is Lashun Novashine
in Qeynos, and I don't think that one is exp anymore.  At least you
can spend cash on heals, though... the idea of NPCs who will perform
services for cash or items (Priestess Clauria in Qeynos will Cure Disease
for a rabid wolf pelt) is already implemented, but only on a very small
scale, and could be expanded upon to really help get rid of some of
the rapidly inflating cash out there.  Item exchange could be taken care
of by using the cash value of the items, which must already be in the
database so vendors can offer to pay for them.
