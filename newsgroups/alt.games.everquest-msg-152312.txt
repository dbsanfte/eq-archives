	I agree that calling Swiftwind an "intermediate reward" is a semantic
trick.

	For how long?  Getting the ES means you've cleared the bottlenecks in the
quest.  Frankly, the stats on this thing aren't that good.  I could have
walked around wielding the Ancient Longsword, too, but it would have been
silly.

	I could maybe see Druids using the ES back when your chances of getting
Faydedar were lower than your chances of being struck by lightning twice, but
now?
