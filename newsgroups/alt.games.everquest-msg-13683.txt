	I think it would be useful at this juncture to point out that I
consider Lokari to be a reasonably sane and rational individual.  While we
have disagreed in the past and will doubtless disagree in the future,
Lokari has exhibited the ability to disagree with civility (provided he/she
is treated with the same civility), and has exhibited the ability to
concede a point and to admit when he/she is wrong.  I find these qualities
admirable in any individual, especially given how rare they are on Usenet.

	Conversely, I consider you to be very shrill and childish.  You
continue to accuse Lokari of saying things that he/she never said, and when
this is pointed out to you, you either continue to insist that he/she said
things he/she provably did *not* say, or you make some sort of lame attempt
to appear disaffected by the whole argument.  You seem wholly incapable of
admitting that you are in any way wrong, or that you have in any way made a
mistake.  When people point out your obvious errors, your response is to
ignore them, insult them, or simply claim that they're wrong.  

	You have all the earmarks of a fanatic, irrational loon, and if
Lokari is guilty of anything, he/she is guilty of not letting you have the
last word and being done with you.  Had I been in Lokari's place, I would
have stopped responding to you the moment I realized you were a complete
flake (i.e. sometime around your 2nd or 3rd post in this "debate").

	AB
