A lot of pickup raids are done on a board, and I guess the bigger
guilds might more or less know when the others are going places, but
as far as I know, the only really fixed thing on EMarr is the Venril
Sathir rotation. Several guilds and a pickup group take turns, anyone
who wants to get into the rotation has to jump him and show they can
handle him, and if he's still alive 24 hours after spawn, he's FFA. Or
something like that.
