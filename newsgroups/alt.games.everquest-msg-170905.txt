You have to NOT eat them to get the effect.

This seems odd, but its how it works.  You eat the food item most "up and
left" in your inventory next time you get hungry.  It is this "next on the
menu" item that gets counted for stat foods.  If you have a stack of misty
there, and you eat one, thats fine, you still get the effect, right down till
you eat the last one, then you lose effect from that (now vanished) stack, and
count the next food item instead.

Since picnics are somewhat expensive, or tedious to prepare, a popular trick
is to "hide" your picnics under other food.  This way you can haul them out
only when needed.  This works, of course, unless you eat all your other
food... but you dont' get the effect of the picnics often, and every time you
are using them for effect, you are risking eating one.

So another trick, slightly more irritating, is to instead "force feed"
yourself something else.  Put a food item in an open inventory slot (not
inside a container) and click on it and you will eat it immediately.  This
staves off hunger for only half the time that eating the item naturally would
have done... but it means you eat the food item you want.  And you can eat
several items this way and really stuff yourself full, which means you won't
get hungry and eat your stat food for quite some time... never if you remember
to do this often enough and to keep yourself stocked up.

Same applies to stat drinks, by the way.
