I hate to admit it, but I still have my Vic20, and I am a computer geek,
I've grown up in front of them.  I still have my Commodore PET as well,
(currently holding my kitchen door open)  I just wanted to say thanks, after
reading your post I brought the Vic20 out of storage and hooked her up(she
still works!  Try that with an intel system) Now I play Serpentine while I'm
Medding or memming spells.
