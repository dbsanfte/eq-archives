let's see, umm, Paludal is where I lived at those levels, much easier 
with a group in there, some places in there can be solo'd tho.  NK, EK 
(crag spiders, keep the silks sell to tailors), the Warrens if you don't 
mind indoor zones, Stonebrunt might be ok at the camps closest to the 
door to the warrens, SK aviaks might be doable too.
