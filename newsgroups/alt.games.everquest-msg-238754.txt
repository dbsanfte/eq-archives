I have been in several groups where the ranger thinks their job is to stand
over with the robes and shoot arrows.  If the mission is a *Sure Win* fine.  If
not I expect them to be using weapons.
A couple of them told me that they do *just as much damage with their arrows as
their weapons*.  These aren't 65 rangers - these are 50s.  If they are that
poor with their weapons I don't want them in my group anway. These would be the
same rangers who never cast a spell and always have full mana.
God I hate sucky rangers.  They give us all a bad name.
