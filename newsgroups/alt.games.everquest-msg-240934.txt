There are really two types of guild.

1.  Raiding guilds are high end guilds who recruit high lvl players to
do the Elemental Planes or other high lvl tasks.  These guilds call on
their members for raids at a moments notice.  I have had people bail
out of a LDoN adventure because the guild has called.

2.  The second are the so called "family guilds:.  These guilds do
lower lvl raids as a group but do not frown on people who cannot make
it.

There are many reasons to join a guild such as ready made groups,
companionship, help with epics and the like.  All are very valid and
the reasons guilds thrive in this game.

Not many disadvantges to guild life .. after all in the end if things
don't work out you simply type /guildremove and you are a free agent
again.

I would suggest that you ask your friend which type of guild they are
setting up .. I suspect it may be type 2 that I have outlined ... if it
is join up ... you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain.
