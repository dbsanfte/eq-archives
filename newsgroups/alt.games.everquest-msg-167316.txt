I've got a Geforce 3 ti-500.  I recently went out and got an ATI 9700 Pro to
replace it, because I'd read some good reviews on the ATI card and had seen
a lot of people saying how good they were.

After two days I took the 9700 back out and put my ti-500 back in.  The ATI
9700 now resides in my "junk" computer (built out of miscellaneous pieces
that are hand-me-downs).

At *best* the 9700 was "as good" as the ti-500.  At worst, it seemed to
actually be *slower* in EQ than my Geforce 3.  (and yes, I know how to tune
and turn off FSAA and such, I *love* speed)

Since that time, Nvidia has come out with a new set of drivers that
noticeably improved the performance of my ti-500.  *Noticeably*.  That's
pretty impressive.

The one thing that the ATI card handled better was particle effects.  If you
play with all particle effects maxed, the ATI card will probably work better
for you.  As I never cared for EQ's particle effects anyway, that wasn't
enough for me to keep the 9700 installed.

I can only imagine the ti4600s perform better than my ti-500.  I've now
decided to skip the ti-4600/9700 generation altogether and go straight for
the next generation Nvidia card which should be coming out soon.
