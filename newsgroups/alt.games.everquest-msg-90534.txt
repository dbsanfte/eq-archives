Hi all,

recently I attended my first raid and I was clueless for most part of it.

We went to a place where several blue to deep-red mobs lived and mostly one
was pulled at a time by the assigned puller. There were three groups sitting
at the spot he pulled to.

The deep-red type mobs were announced to be for the high lvl group.

Now I wonder how this should work. Say a blue mob is pulled. If all groups
jump it, it dies very quickly (this is what I saw). If one group fights it,
it's just like grouping, and not raiding (?).
Hmm.. have to admit I'm not sure when something is called a raid, what the
definition is. I thought it was when multiple groups work together in a
dangerous place, mostly aiming to kill one very big mob.

I played my enchanter and tash was most of time only thing I could get off
before the beast died. I mezzed the one add that we got, but wasn't really
necessary since the lifespam of mob01 was about equal to my casting time for
mez.

Things I wonder about: is it usual to divide certain spells? Say
chanter_in_group2 tashes, shaman_in_group1 slows? When and how do you
discuss these things?
Is the idea to fight one mob with multiple groups?
Which things should be in guildchat, which not? ("%T is mezzed" should be I
guess)

Are there any guides or tips online for such situation?
I found tactics for the various dragons, but obviously I'm not yet ready for
those. Looking for advice how to raid an average dungeon when most of the
time you're fighting 'normal' mobs.

Natasja
