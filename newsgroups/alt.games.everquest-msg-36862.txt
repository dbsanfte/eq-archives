Here again I will tout the virtues of niche marketing.  Hopefully the
day will come when a gaming company can create a game and if folks don't
agree with its rules or basic concepts, they won't play it, rather than
insisting that the developer change the game to meet their individual
ideals.  Imagine the games that could be created if developers didn't
have to reduce everything to lowest common denominators.  You could have
bright flashing number games for powergamers and evil no number
permanent death games for roleplayers and never run into a roleplayer in
your number crunching game or a number cruncher in your roleplaying
game..... ah well, a man can dream.
