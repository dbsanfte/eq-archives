I said I read as far as I said I read.  If I had read none of your post
you would have a point, but since that wasn't the case you are instead
thrashing about pretending I said something other than what I did. 
Again, I read as far as I said I read. Your inability to understand what
that means is in no way a reflection on my right to comment on your vile
sense of self worth over others.  

I have and will die rather than kill others for MY mistakes.  I also am
a firm believer in my duty to warn others, if I am able, should I find
that my mistake is about to be dropped onto them.  I pulled it, I am
responsible for either killing it, or for doing what ever I can to
reduce the chances of my mistake killing someone else.  Can I force you
to act in a civilized manner in the game? No.  Can I publicly state here
in this forum my complete contempt for your stated feelings on the
topic.  You better believe it.  If you do as you say, play a solo druid
who trains folks w/o a care, then you sir are a dr00d and those of us
who play respectable druids suffer from the reputation your acts lay at
all of our feet.

Now you can blather back to me about your right to play like a child,
trampling others without concern because the world revolves around you,
or you can put me back in your KF where I belong since you are not able
to deal with my words... or just maybe, you could stop and think about
what I've said, consider that just maybe you need to rethink your place
in a world shared by all the other players... nah, go for the KF.
