Ranger is a funny class.   You won't need what you think you will.

STR has relatively little effect on small fast weapons, your bread and butter.
Sta effects your hit points... which are always, always going to suck no
matter what you do.
Agility affects your AC... which is always, always going to suck no matter what

you do.
Wisdom effects your mana pool... but the spells you will be using, by and
large,
are incredibly inexpensive, your mana pool is hardly a major concern.

What stat is important to you, then?

Dexterity

Dex affects the frequency at which your weapons proc.  Rangers get
access to a wide variety of fast weapons with decent procs on them,
and further get spells which add additional proc triggered effects on
top of that, at higher levels.  Getting a high fire rate on those special
effects
is the most useful thing that stats can do for you.  Try, for example, dual
weilding gnoll hide lariats... with dual weild, dual attack, haste, and a
200 dex, mobs will be simply unable to do anything at all if they don't
resist the constant flow of stuns.

Of course if you aren't twinked, at low levels this won't mean much
to you, other than that a high dex will make quick work of getting skill
increases while fighting.

If, though, you can get ahold of a proccing weapon that works at low
levels (one of the easiest to twink with would be Coldain Velium, which
can be purchased in Thurgadin from vendors if you don't want to do
the helmet quest for it) you'll see what I mean right away.  At any rate,
in the long run, its massive melee damage that is your main contribution
to a fight, and getting the proc rate up by maxing out your dex is going
to make a significant difference to your ability to do this.
