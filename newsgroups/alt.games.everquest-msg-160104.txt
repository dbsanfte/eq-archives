Incorrect.  For a long time, the server transmitted your exact XP (rather
than just the percentage of the XP bar that it does now), so we knew exactly
what the penalties were.

Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians, and Necromancers all had a 10% class
penalty.  (In fact, they still do, but they get a corresponding bonus to
cancel out the penalty, making it look like it was removed.  We know this
because the server still sends your XP total when you zone, and so people
have measured by zoning, killing something, and zoning again).

Someone else has posted a link to the site that had the old information.
That site was correct as to the penalties/bonuses for the various races and
classes.
