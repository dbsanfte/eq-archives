With umpteen kazillion twinks in the game, it is impossible to define what
someone 'should' have.  Based on what a 41 Rogue could accomplish, you have
adequate equipment.  I've met rogues who would *only* use that which they'd
looted themselves, never buying anything.  They were perfectly happy with
their stuff ... and more importantly, having fun with the game.
I didn't bank my BR until about 45th when I got a locustlure (procs @46th).
If you are a buyer of items, look for a Slime Coated Harpoon or TT or
anything with decent damage/good delay.  Mainhand you have to look for a
balance in the two.  Offhand, it is 100% about ratio.  10/20=9/18=12/24.
