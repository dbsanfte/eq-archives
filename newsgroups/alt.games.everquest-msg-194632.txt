Yes, unless you have invis to undead they will see you. The Kith Forest
run has a rep well over and above its actual danger level though. Stay at
the top  of the zone wall and look around properly and you should be able
to scoot through going around the zone wall with no problems at all....add
a SoW to the mix and you'll be fine.....if the corpse is in Kith, then
wait till daylight when the undead go away.
