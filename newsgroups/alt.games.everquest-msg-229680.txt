I bow to you component buffing is a pain as the owner of a 53 cleric I
understand all of this.

Well interested in this ... on my server (Bristlebane) my 65 shaman char has
actually spent more than an Enchanter in getting his premium spell Focus of
the Seventh (averages about 3K more in cost).

I was bored yesterday and announced in PoK that I was doing one round of 65
Shaman buffs at the bank. Interestingly, I mentioned nothing about payment
and of the group that formed only one player payed (11pp as a matter of
fact).  After mana denuding myself of a full round of buffs I was thinking
about the enchanter phenomena ... why do players pay these guys sometimes
exhorbitant amounts for their services?

Agreed, I can make my own mana and do not depend on them for mana regen on
the other hand I have to shell out more to buy my spells (glyphed runes are
hard to come by for me) and overall my buffs do more good for players than a
pure mana regen.

Perhaps we Shammies are not being appreciated o)
Rant off.
