13 hours for me.  During which time I took a break to help a guildmate 
do his Shawl run, and he happened to spot the Dire Wolf Stalker on 
track, so we went and took care of that after.

I did NOT hear any flapping, despite being told of this solution.  I 
paid attention to my screen sporadically during the day, conversing with 
guildmates and the like, in between browsing the web alt tabbed away 
from the game with the sound up, and also watching TV and reading and 
playing board games and the like.

At any rate, I happened to have the game up on screen but wasn't really 
watching it when the griffon actually spawned and caught my attention 
out of the corner of my eye.  I watched it fly around for a little 
while, bemused by the fact that I could still hear the waves on the 
shore, but none of the flapping I was relying on much of the day to tell 
me when he'd popped!

Well after about a minute of listening, I stood up and engaged, took him 
down neatly, and went off in search of Bloodmaw.

Turns out Bloodmaw is KOS, and I'm supposed to bring someone to charm 
him; didn't happen to have someone handy, so I tried something I'd heard 
of: I invised, approached, and spammed him with one of the Yakman Parts 
till invis broke, he opened a trade window, and then attacked me.  I 
cast FD, and after he turned away, indifferent, I hit accept.

I'm told this should not have worked, all I can say is, it did this time.

Off to the bank where I picked up the Lodizal piece of the map, checking 
faction to see that despite the shawl run, I was still Ally with the 
three giant factions.  That map piece has been sitting there since week 
one of Velious opening on the server, this was the first day I decided 
to try camping Stormfeather instead of just hoping I'd find him up while 
running thru.

Found the Lost Pirate, got a container from him, filled it with pieces 
and combined for the map, handed that to him to get another map, killed 
the rabid cougar that spawned, went up and handed in the map to captain 
Nalot and presto, Eyepatch of Plunder.

While a 20% haste isn't much, its an improvement over none at all, when 
I don't happen to be grouped with an enchanter or shaman or bard (and 
half the time when I -am- grouped with a bard, they're too busy juggling 
mezzes to keep haste up) and helps me compete with my pet (who likes to 
taunt me because I can haste him but not myself)

Oh, and to round out my good day in Iceclad, Lodizal popped while I was 
headed back out after getting my eyepatch.  I got a guild group to 
scramble in, we took him down, and I won the roll for the shell piece. 
Completed the shell quest, which makes a shield I'm using as my new 
back, boosting my AC and giving me perma EB without having to swap in my 
EB ring.

Oh, and I also spotted Midnight, and had taken down Garou a few days 
before while checking on Lodizal.  Finishing this quest yeilded a fairly 
unintersting weapon at my level and gear state, but I'd killed midnight 
repeatedly back when Velious was originally released and never managed 
to find Garou, so this felt like completing a quest that I'd been on for 
what, 5 years?
