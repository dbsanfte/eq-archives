I still think you're mistaken.  I've levelled a lot of characters in a lot
of places, I understand well the trade between kill rate and individual mob
XP.  Lake of Ill Omen used to be full of people all the time, in the way
Paludal is now, and I believe the ZEM was lowered to encourage them to move
elsewhere, but it's certainly not 60 now.

I was solo'ing there with my beastlord, so I was aware of the kill rate and
there were no other variables.  I'll eat my hat if the ZEM in LoIo is 60.

(I'd have to borrow a hat, but you get my point).

However, since neither of us have hard technical data I suggest we both
have some cake :)
