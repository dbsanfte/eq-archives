Thank you.  I can see this as a case where there's a reason to
target a mob without immediately attacking it -- namely, there's
time (since the mob is mezzed) for everyone to get into optimal
position, and /assist is used to figure out which mob is "going
to be attacked next but don't whack it yet".

As I mentioned earlier in this thread, I haven't been in many
such groups yet; more often, crowd control consists of letting
the adds whack on us, and the point of the MA is just to ensure
that we concentrate our firepower in order to reduce the mobs'
combined DPS as fast as possible.  But I can see where the
additional finesse could be useful, so I'll see about retraining
myself not to use attack-on-assist but instead to manually turn
on autoattack in all cases.

A side question: why does your announcement say "my target is"
twice?
