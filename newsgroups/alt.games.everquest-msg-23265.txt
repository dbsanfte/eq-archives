But he *wasn't* untouchable.  He could be killed in EXACTLY
the same way he was killing others.  All the whining evils had
to do was to train HIM in return.  Hit him head-on with a massive
train from the Orc Highway, for example.  Being level five,
he's a LOT more susceptible to sudden death from trains than
the 15-20's who were complaining about the SG's were.
