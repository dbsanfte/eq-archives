Well if we're going to wave character lists (and since EMarr is locked
again) :)

Taellaar 36 de rogue
Novasina 24 de necro
And - a low level druid, ranger, and paladin - druid abandoned, ranger
used as a farmer, and paladin a mule.

Tarrew Marr (abandoned):
Lelilali 19 barb shaman
Ryouseika 14 he mage - I never did manage to make my pet tank for me
Sakuna 10 ikky monk - so fun I'm tempted to start her over on EMarr
Bakanish 9 human sk - no fun whatsoever, only started her to kill one
of those fish for a friend who didn't want a faction hit
Shaolan 11 we ranger - I discovered I don't like rangers,even though I
lust for tracking on all my chars
Callily 7 gnome enchie
Jarlaore 4 barb shaman - an attempt to restart Lelilali and do her
properly, never worked out
Tsami 7 wood elf bard - loved selo's, didn't like bards.

Firiona Vie:
Oliinya, 6 eru enchie - to fiddle with when EMarr is down, because I
want to know a bit more about the what/when/why of enchie tactics.

Plus, I think I still have a few spread out over other servers from
wayyyyy back when I started and had no idea how to play :)

Oh, and I have 2 or 3 chars on test, but I'm not patching just to look
at them *g*

Ryou
