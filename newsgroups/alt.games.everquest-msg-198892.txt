On AB KEI is often MGBed at the nexus bank. Aside from that there are
several chanters who don't have a set price and most of them give it free to
anyone under 30 or so.
As for the rest it's common to suggest a donation of level x1pp. So at level
40 pay 40pp, at level 65, pay 65pp etc.

But I don't care. I have 4 KEI+ chanters in the guild so I can always get my
crack if I really want it :).
