We killed Rage with 8 people, with a monk tank... so Im pretty sure 1 solid
group could easily kill Rage (hard to test, with it being so damn contested)

Its hard to make calls on what qualifies as "a raid force" because realistic
numbers vary soooo much across guilds... e.g for several guilds I know, a
realistic raid force for VS would be 18-25 people

But I know a guild thats killed him with 3 people (talking about pre-aa
abilities and manaburn)

So for the first guilds... 12 people would not be anywhere near enough to
kill VS... yet the last guild is gtg with 3 people

If you were a GM who would you say had the required raid force there?
