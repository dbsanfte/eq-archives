If you find that you need to med a lot, it has nothing to do with your mana 
pool size, it has to do with your mana usage vs your mana regeneration.  
The only times your mana pool matters are when things go wrong, during 
normal xp playing, you should not be losing much mana over time overall.  
If you are, then regardless of mana pool size, you will eventually have to 
sit down and med for a while.  With a smaller pool, you will have to do so 
more frequently, but, for less time each time you need a break.  With a 
larger pool, you can go longer, but, will also have to meditate longer to 
regain the mana.
