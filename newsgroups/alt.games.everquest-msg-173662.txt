ACK! Don't use Spiderling Silks to make bandages!  You will need two of them
to make a thread and two threads to make a bandage or FOUR silks just for
one little bandage.  Spiderling Silks sell for for 3-5pp each in the bazaar.
Ridiculous I know, but some people must be paying it because the price isnt'
going down.  So sell them in the bazaar and buy regular bandages.  At one
silver each for bandages, one platinum piece will buy you 100 bandages!
Even if you sell them cheap for 1pp each you will come out MUCH better this
way.
