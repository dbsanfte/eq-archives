Wow, I'm surprised nobody mentioned Gothic and Gothic II yet, both of 
which have often been compared to Morrowind and very favorably at that. 
If she enjoyed Morrowind I think Gothic would be an excellent game to 
check into. You may have a little trouble finding the first Gothic game 
for sale now at retail/online. I'm not sure. But Gothic II is fairly 
recent and easy to come by. You might want to check Amazon.com for both 
games and peruse the reader reviews of them there while you are it. If 
no luck on the original Gothic at retail, odds are very good you could 
find it cheap on eBay. Another possible choice would be Arx Fatalis 
which many compared to the old Ultima dungeon game (was it Ultima 
Underground? I can't believe I forget now - I played both of them but 
that was many years ago). For reviews of the above, info and patches if 
there are any, I'd highly recommend Gamespot.com for further info.

And you can tell her in case you weren't both already aware, The Elder 
Scrolls IV is now in the works with early preview and development 
stories starting to come out about it. But I imagine it is probably a 
good year off, although I don't know that.
