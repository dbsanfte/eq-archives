Cutting down on camping and getting folks out of PC and DSP, I'm all for
that. And with the advent of the new zones in LDoN they are doing that. You
go into a zone and no one is there except for your group. No griefing! Nice.
But why restrict it to a group of 5 -6 adventurers?  That seems a bit mad to
me.  But then most things do. ;-)
