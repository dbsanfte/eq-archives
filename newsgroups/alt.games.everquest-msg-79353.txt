 Well, let's see. Just ran an Atari 2600 emu on my DC and discovered
something I had forgotten. Atari's fishing game is more fun than Max Payne.
I don't care how many multi-textured bad guys you can randomly generate, it's
all the same damn guy, and after you've shot him 200 times, it's pretty
repetitive. So is Atari fishing, but a game's limited to 100 fish before you
win, whereas MP requires you to kill about 800 goons, which means it lasts
too long. Tack on a terrible "plot," loads of annoying dialogue and "graphic
novel" scenes (that make Spawn look look well-written) and the stupid
hopping-jumping sequences, and you've got a lot of time spent on dull and
irritating parts with no gameplay value.
 As I said, Atari Fishing is also repetitive, in that you just catch fish
over and over, but there's no time wasted sitting there waiting for the next
damn cutscene to finish loading.. It therefore keeps you playing straight
through, with no time to be bored or annoyed. Add the kick-ass multiplayer
support (lacking in MP) and it's no contest!
 Last thing is replay value - I can still enjoy Atari Fishing, whereas I
couldn't be forced to sit through all that Payne again.
 Graphics be damned. MP would need to drop all the pretention, get rid of the
3d platformer elements, and just have you run down a street and shoot 100
guys to be as fun as Atari Fishing.
 Sad thing is, there are better Atari 2600 games. Heh.
