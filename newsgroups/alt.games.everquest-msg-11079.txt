    Yes and no. DA has a detaunt component, but if it hates you (and it will
because you sat down to camp, if nothing else) it will stay on you. You
don't stand when DA'ed and hit, but DA won't last long enough to camp.

    If you need to camp, there's usually too many mobs for anyone to notice
ones on you except bright tanks and people in your group.

    One of the "tricks" you can do is DA and try to /q when the DA icon is
showing. You CAN get it so that DA lasts until you disconnect that way. On
one bad Overking pull I apparently tanked the King, the Herbalist add and
their guards for two minutes while others were able to camp. ;-)

    Someone should make a list of tricks you can do, like sitting when using
right-click items or the DA /q thing. Oh, wait. Verant would correct them as
"bugs". NM. :-/
