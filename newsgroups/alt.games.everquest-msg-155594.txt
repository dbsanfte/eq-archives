Last night, a few of us went hunting. The group consisted of 33 monk
(me), 33 wizard, 30 enchanter, 30 ranger and a 35 cleric, I had just
made 33 btw so no blue at all in my bar. Anyhow, we where in OT and
after about 4 pulls, 3 of which were yellow cons and the last was red,
I had only made about 1/2 of a blue. Someone said that OT was not the
best place for exp so we went to DSP. Again, killed about 5 yellows
and received 1/2 blue. Should I be going somewheres else to hunt? Is
this normal now for exp at this level? I don't remeber it being like
that.  I am also wondering if the packett losses with the servers
being unstable last night would have anything to do with what seemed
to be a stuck experience bar?

TIA
