"Green" numbers mean a moderately good connection
"Yellow" numbers mean there is some degradation of connection
"Red" Numbers mean its time to think about logging out before you get
killed

More specifically the first number in your example, "226" means your
most recent test ping was 226 ms.
The second two numbers mean you 0% packet loss both to and from the
server and the final number means that you must have been in a quiet
area as it reflects data load or volume.  The higher that last number
the more data coming your way from the server and so the more your
machine has to process.  You may experience something along the lines of
video lag if that number gets really high as your machine may not be
able to process all data in real time.  This usually happens when you
are in an area with lots of folks, especially if lots of them are
casting.
