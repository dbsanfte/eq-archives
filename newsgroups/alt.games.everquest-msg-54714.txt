A) I can pull through other groups with it and not lose my mob.
B) It has a dot's range, great for distance pulls.
C) It's cheap.
D) It's quick.
E) There is a definite and noticeable (and parseable) difference in my
   damage output after a flamelick.  At level 45, last level I parsed and
   tested it, my damage-per-second went up by about 1.5% when I used
   flamelick compared to when I didn't.
F) I ran out of hotkey room for a taunt button.  This works better.


I've always wondered why so few rangers still use it when I get such obvious
benefit from it.  :)  I have found that it's more useful against some mobs
than others (on Sol B kobolds, for instance, it doesn't seem to do anything). 
It's almost always a great pulling spell though, assuming you're the one
that's gonna be tanking the mob.
