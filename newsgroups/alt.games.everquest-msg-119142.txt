And here I just got thru telling DT no other post in the thread
was as childish as him calling you a "jackass".

DT's nothing at all like the true maroons who post here, so I can't
go along with your generalized attack on him.  In fact, I wouldn't
be surprised if my own posting history showed a noticeably higher
ratio of foolishness to sense than his, hell Lokari's dinged me more
than once and she usually only takes shots at idiots and jackasses.
That said, I see him as being way off base here, he oughta just
give it up and quit thrashing about.
