Well, I don't exactly know why you had both the bard *and* the cleric doing 
the lulling/pacifying. Let the cleric med. The bard should be able to pull 
without any help at all. At worst, I have had one lull fail on my bard in 
an entire dungeon - maybe two once or twice. More often than not, I go the 
entire adventure without a single fail, and my CHA is nothing to brag 
about. I do try to always have see invis so I don't get caught by surprise 
though.

The bard also should have been doing crowd control on multiple pulls, even 
if it meant not fighting at all that battle so they could keep the extras 
locked down.

I can't speak as well to the tanking abilities of the ranger, but I've 
heard they shouldn't have too much trouble maintaining aggro. Maybe that's 
at the higher levels. /shrug
