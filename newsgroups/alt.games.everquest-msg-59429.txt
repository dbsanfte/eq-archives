  And I say again... SO WHAT?

  As long as the penalties for dying in an "unfair fight" are not too
overwhelmingly steep (no massive experience loss or loss of good items), and
there are other things about the game you enjoy (PvE elements, fairer
fights, ect.) what does it matter?

  A game can still be fun even WITH unfair fights.
