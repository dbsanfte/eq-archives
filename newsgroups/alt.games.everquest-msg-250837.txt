Do you have Phantom Army? I don't recall what level you are but if you're
not yet 18, just *wait* till you get this power, it will dramatically affect
your soloability and will be the perfect answer to your Boss and Lieutenant
challenges. There isn't a mission my level that I can't solo, and that's
entirely due to Phantom Army.

Aye, that is painful. I will often help friends who need help clearing a few
missions and stuff, and as long as I enter with my eyes wide open to this
fact I'm happy to help. What I can't understsand is when I get invited to a
group by someone who is many levels below me and then takes on missions that
give me zero experience without so much as a comment. What exactly are they
thinking when they invite me?
