So, I set the bitpsperpixel in eqclient.ini to 16 from 32, odd that
the ingame options windows still shows 32 bits though.

I also switched between windowed and not.  That does seem to make it
normal, I can even go back to full screen after the "redraw" fixes
things.

The dxdiag output, what are you looking for specifically?  It says I'm
running 9.0b and all tests pass, including the manual tests.

A seeming byproduct of this is that EQ runs at least as slow as my old
IBM T21.  This HP is 1.6GHz, 1gb ram, and the mobile ATI card with
32mb.  The old one was SIS builtin video, 1GHz, and 512mb ram.  What
gives with that?  Does HP just suck rocks?

I also looked at omegadrivers but I'm very hesitant to load any.  ATI
states to use the vendor's drivers and I've loaded the altest HP
drivers specifically for this model.

I'm seriously bummed here.  I'm going to be out of town for a few days
and was hoping I could use this machine to play during my offtime
(which will be quite a bit) but so far it's proving at least unstable,
if not downright unusable.

Thanks for all the help so far.
