I took more than a few "convenience" ports, but not until long after
"port whoring" became commonplace.  When I needed a port in a hurry
and not from a common destination I depended on friends just as you
did.  I had poor luck buying ports anywhere except in the common
jumping off points, not too many Druids out hunting respond to offers
of 50 or 100pp and I never carried much more than that.  For the
usual stuff it was pretty easy to find somebody happy to give me a
ride for 20 or 30.  The one time I tried the "taxi" channel the only
response I got was from a guildmate (who refused payment, so I buffed
her up as best I could).
