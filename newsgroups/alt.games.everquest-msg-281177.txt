Well, I wasn't addressing the OP's problem. I have no idea what his
problem is but he seemed pretty sure it was a video card problem and
if he presented it to a tech support person as a video card problem,
then the 'We don't support that card' seems like a reasonable response.

I don't see where he said the TS guy said it was a video card problem.
