Yes. Idiotic, I know. But I did it in three play sessions without dying
and made a bunch of plat. Would I have done better in a good, constant
pull group out in OT or someplace? No doubt. But I'm a stubborn bastard
at times, and I found a place I could solo at 35, and said "Srew it.
I'll just solo through hell level."
  Where was I, and what was I doing? I was on the top floor of the new
and improved Najena. The quest skellies they put in there are *still*
conning blue have the time at 36, and in 35 hell almost all of them were
blue. I probably went through easily 30 stacks of bandages in three
days, and got my bind wounds skill up to almost 150. I was able to take
down at least two in a row, and sometimes all three spawn points before
I would go bind up to half and sit a bit to heal while they respawned.
  Don't know about on your server, but on Xev Najena is mostly empty.
Even on the weekend, middle of the day, there were numerous periods when
I was the only person in the zone.
  The skellies drop the Hilt of the Nobleman (name?) for the GB quest,
and I gave away loot rights for it to more players than I can remember.
But they also drop nice plat (The highest I saw was, I believe, 4 PP, 8
GP, and change) and ringmail armor or bronze daggers. I saved up that
stuff until I was encumbered, than ran up the lavastorm wall to the
temple of S.R. and sold everything to the gnome vendor on the veranda. I
cashed in all my change there too by trash buying/selling.
  To kill time between spawns if I had extra health, I was wiping out
all the Tentacle Terrors. They also will occasionall drop plat or some
gems, along with a bunch of trash I destroyed. Yesterday I FINALLY had
one drop the whip, after probably a hundred TT's had been slaughtered.
So it *does* still drop, but it's pretty rare.
   A friend had asked me to kill the mist elementals to get some drop of
theirs for blacksmithing.  I probably killed several dozen, and not one
of the elementals ever dropped a darn thing. :-/
  So, anyway, you apparently *can* solo a warrior if you find the right
time/place/mob combination. In 35 Hell, it's Najena. I won't do it
again, but it was ......... interesting to say the least.
