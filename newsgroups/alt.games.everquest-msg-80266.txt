    	I play EQ over the others because it was pretty much my first love 
MMORPG wise. I'd tried other games before it (Meridian 59, Legends of 
Kesmai, The Realms, etc.) but EQ was the one that sucked me in. I've played 
DAoC (in beta) and AO (trial account) but both failed to really grab me. 
Asheron's Call was the only other game that I played for any real period of 
time, but it always pailed in comparison to EQ. EQ just has the right feel 
of both PCs, NPCs MOBs and locations that make it feel 'real'. The only two 
games before it that captured my life so completely were The Elder Scrolls 
Arena and Daggerfall. I finished Arena and am still playing Daggerfall, and 
am waiting very patiently for Morrowind. Did I manage to answer the 
question? -Raydeen
