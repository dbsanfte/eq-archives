I wish SOE would update their web site to include the latest patch
notes, so that someone could post them here.  Because there's an
item I'm itching to ask a question about and I wanted to get the
quote right.  But to heck with it, I'm going to ask anyway.

One of the patch notes said something about adjusting the tribute
values of some attuneable and no-trade items.

I have always found my no-trade items to be unacceptable as tribute,
and I assumed that that was for the same reason that they were no-trade
(to make them less attractive for farming, among other reasons).  So
I was sort of surprised to see the implication that there any no-trade
items that have tribute values.  Can anyone mention some examples?
