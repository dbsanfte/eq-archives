Hail,


Anyone else notice a flood of Ghoulbanes on the market?  I just saw two
Ghoulbanes auctioned in GFay in the last hour, and I have only ever seen one
auctioned in there before (I am not on every day, so I may have missed
them).  Result of the new Ghoulbane quest?  I bought one of the Ghoulbane's
auctioned.  Lost my Mith BP in the deal :-(, but hey, I'd much rather the
GB.  (When I get a few more lvl's just do the quest myself and buy another
BP :-)).  Anyone else seen more GB's auctioned lately?
