In this case, a simple "Yes."  He's not begging for something, he's
providing something to me.  And I'd probably give him a Modulating Rod when
I arrived to cover the mana cost if I was powerful enough to cast that
spell.  I find dOoD sPeAk annoying, but I don't usually bother to point it
out to people in game.  People use it in groups, I just shrug and ignore
it.  I'm usually too busy trying to keep my pet in line to worry about it
anyway.  My complaint is buff beggars who *demand* that I give them stuff
(and yes, my Magician is occaisionally asked for food, bandages, throwing
knives, pet weapons, and dimensional pockets) and then can't even be polite
about it.  I'm not an RP Nazi.  I don't care if people use "thee and thou"
all the time.  (As a matter of fact, I find that annoying as well.  In my
opinion, Olde English isn't much more appropriate to Norrath than dOOd
SpEaK.)

As far as SoW, it's an acronym, just like NASA, laser, and radar.  I'm not
sure that acronyms are entirely "in character," but I don't have any realy
problem with them.  As far as "rez" and "mez", they are abbreviations, but
I can live with them because they make some kind of sense.  (Ressurection
and Mesmerize are both a bit much to try to type in the middle of a big
fight, for example.)  If I'm *asking* someone for something, I'll usually
type out the whole word because that's the way I prefer to do it.  If I'm
in a fight and a loose sabretooth tiger starts pounding on me, I'll
probably type "mez %t !" because I wouldn't live long enough to type
anything else.  Magicians aren't famous for their skill as punching bags.
