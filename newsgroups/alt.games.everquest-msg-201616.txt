I've been to HoT, and seen how much my poison line gets resisted, with the 
mobs tashed, malosinied, and Roed.  (Malo and Malosini do not stack, does 
bard debuff stack with those?).  As a shaman I only have Poison based 
rains, and I have seen how much the poison line of spells I have has been 
resisted by various mobs there when I was at level 60.  Shaman rain spells 
are nowhere near as nice as yours, the last one I got was at level 39 I 
think.

I have never seen a pattern to resists of spells that relates to mob 
health, and, in fact, your post here is the first time I have ever even 
heard it mentioned.
