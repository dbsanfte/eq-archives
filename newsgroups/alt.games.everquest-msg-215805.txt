Hi Keith, if you are on Venril Sathir Server (quite likely by your email
address (hide that in newsgroups), and that New Dawn is the UK/EU release (I
think)) then feel free to send me a tell if you see me online:
To find out if I am type /who all Raaz ;
If I am online, then /tell Raaz insert own text .
While I have only been playing six months I can certainly answer a lot of
your questions.

A couple of places for information are
http://everquest.allakhazam.com
http://venrilsathir.co.uk
http://eq.crgaming.com

all with their own forums.

As far as player guilds go (as opposed to class guilds), get to level 20
before worrying about that, get to lvl 7 or so then start joining groups,
don't be afraid to ask people around you, if they laugh at you they are
probably pretty inexperienced players themselves and have only just
discovered the things you are asking about.
