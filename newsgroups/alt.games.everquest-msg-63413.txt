If you haven't already done so, download Joe D.'s (a.k.a. Pasketti) log
parser. (I don't have the URL handy, but a quick search here should turn
it up. Joe just posted a new release of it.) Take your character log
(assuming you don't delete it all the time) and run it through the
parser. (File name should be something like "EQBillybob" if your char.
name is Billybob) The resulting data from the log parser will show you
all the skills you've increased, and a numerical value for where they
are currently.

If you've deleted your log files, then yes, you're screwed until you
either get them over 100 or get more skill increases at which time you
can run them to find out.
