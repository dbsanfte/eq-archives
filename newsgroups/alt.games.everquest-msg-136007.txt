It sounds like the reason no one does anything for you is because you
don't do anything for others.  I have found that being polite and
appreciative has netted me huge rewards.  people have given me armor,
weapons, found my corpse, teleported me, given me money and most
importantly become friends, just because I try to give as much as I
get.  The negatives that I *DO* get I do my best to ignore, and my
experience becomes much more fun.  What goes around comes around.

I've also noticed that the nice people (seem to) outnumber the
mean/greedy.  when a fellow player was finally getting tired of people
begging for sow every time they saw her, someone gave her 25pp (a lot
for a 15 druid).  she tried to refuse to take it three times, but
finally accepted it.  now she doesn't mind as much sow'ing the random
wandering beggar.

I've also noticed that joining a guild helps teach you these things. 
you develop a community of people who help eachother, so you can compete
with mobs and skill levels rather than each other.

my personal best night ever stories usually involve someone I helped, or
someone I developed a friendship with after they helped me.

sorry, just my two copper pieces worth.  I imagine the game may be quite
different on other servers, I've only used one server.
