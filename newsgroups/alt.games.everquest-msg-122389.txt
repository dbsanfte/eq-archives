Where is a good spot for a 54 warrior? Seb is decent, but friends have said
lower/upper in velks got them through 54 in a day (8 hours of play). I can
never get a group in velks. Being 54, upper/lower/frenzy refuse me. Those
are the only 2 places i know of where you don't have to bring your own group
to grind. My guild is small and we aren't all on at the same time. When we
are, we are limited by what we can do due to lvls. I need to reach 60 soon.
Where is a good spot?
