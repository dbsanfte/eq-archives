FWIW, I use the latest free build of Mozilla (except I haven't installed it
on this machine yet...) and I avoid all the stupid scripts and virus
attacks.

I also stopped using Windows Explorer as the windows interface and I run
Aston or LiteStep as a shell over the 98 kernel. The stability and
performance increase is amazing. LiteStep is free, but it  requires a bit of
text file configuration, Aston is $28 but the eval is only limited in some
of it's configuration options and you can run it indefinitely.

Anyways, since changing shells, my 98 machines have had an uptime of over
two weeks without a reboot. Prior to that, two days without a lockup was a
miracle.

Programs actually run faster, have more RAM available and if an app
misbehaves, it doesn't shitcan the OS along with it (can you say "Explorer
has caused an illegal operation...). Also, I haven't had a single BSOD since
swapping shells....

I have mine configured to look and work like XP (which, BTW, will *NEVER*
grace any computer I own or build.. sorry master Bates.... ummm... Gates)
and that's what everyone *thinks* I'm running!

So, if your adventurous, you might consider testing an alternate shell
instead of exploder!
