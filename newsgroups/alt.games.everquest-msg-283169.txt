It's not just the second reward.  When your account qualifies for two
years worth of rewards, you get to pick a second character who will get
BOTH the first and second rewards.  Whichever character you picked to
get the first reward will also automatically get the second reward as
well.

When your account hits three years, you can pick a third character who
will get all of the first three rewards, and the first two characters
chosen will also get the third reward added, etc.
