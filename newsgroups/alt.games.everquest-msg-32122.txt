Actually, that article concerns the right of people to criticize
companies ON THIRD-PARTY MESSAGE BOARDS, without having their
anonymous identities forced to be revealed to the companies being
criticized.

Now please explain what this has to do with your alleged "right"
to mouth off at Verant on Verant's *own* message boards, when
you were stupid enough to do it despite the fact that:

   1.  They made it clear they wouldn't accept any abuse
       of the boards and banning was a possible consequences, and
   2.  Since you logged onto the boards using your EQ login,
       the knew *exactly* who you were from the start.

In short, the news article you linked for us concerned whether
ANONYMOUS criticisms OFF SITE could remain anonymous.  But you
were doing it NON ANONYMOUSLY, ON VERANT'S BOARDS.

Don't give up your day job, you'll never make it as a lawyer.

Next, you'll tell us you have the "right" to mouth off
at someone in their own home without getting your butt booted
out the door.

You have every right to criticize Verant.  Just don't expect
them to let you keep doing it on *their* soapbox.


>Several months ago Verant banned my account because of being critical of
>Verant on their message board.

Oh, admit it -- you weren't just "being critical", you were being
an ass.  If Verant had banned people for merely "being critical of
Verant" on their boards, I'd have been banned too, along with
95% of the other posters.  So tell us, *exactly* what did you
*actually* say?

If you're that proud of your "free speech", surely you won't
mind repeating it here.


>  It doesn't matter what their little EULA
>says, FACT is, and LAW is, that its illegal.

You have yet to make an actual case for your mistaken belief.


>Please move back to China, Verant.  You will be right at home there.

No wonder they booted you.
