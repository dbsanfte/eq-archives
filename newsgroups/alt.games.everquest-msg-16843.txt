I would have to disagree there.  The ATi card is very cost effective, but
seems to have more issues.  This has to do with the custom APIs that have to
be used in programming with it.  When I was at the San Diego Fan Fare, one
of the developers stated that they have more issues with ATi cards than any
other type of card, and with the Radion cards more than any other ATi card.

The reason I asked him about the ATi cards is because I have a Radion 32MB
DDR AGP.

They have the least issues with the nVidia based cards.
