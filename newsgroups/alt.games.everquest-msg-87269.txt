I totally agree.  Once a moron takes a nasty jab at me I have not had much luck
trying to talk peaceful and friendly to him / her. 
I am NOT gonna be some worthless parent's babysitter either.
However,  I'll *NOT* let them ruin my game.  I add them to my /ignore forever
list - and I note that person for my wizard, druid and cleric, too.  End of
problem.
