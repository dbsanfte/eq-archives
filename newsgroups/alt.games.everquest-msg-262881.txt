Somehow I've been goaded into arguing a theoretical argument that
all items could be purchasable for RL money and still have a fun game.  I
believe this could work, but not for EQ, and not if all items are
ridiculously cheap.  For EQ, I'll only go so far as to say that buying
droppable items for RL money does no harm to the game or the players who
don't participate.

Fair enough.  I concede that buying equipment with RL money or allowing
multiple people to play a character violates the service agreement.  

I don't agree that it's bad for the game, and I certainly don't agree that a
game which does allow it cannot be fun and rewarding.

Right.  If grinding and camping aren't fun, and don't allow you to do fun
things (hey, maybe raiding is your thing, and you can't do it without grinding
first), you won't have fun.  And you're truly in a bad state if you play the
game this way and never have any fun.

I've done just this.  I had to grind a lot to catch up with my group of
friends, but have taken it easy for the last year or so.  I see interesting
zones, talk to amusing NPCs, and kill them.

>What exactly is the 'fun'?

For me, it's chatting, teaming up to kill stuff, surviving a near-wipe by the
skin of our teeth, and getting gear that lets us to to the next level of the
same fun things.

Sure.  That could work too.

>someone a drop or upgrade or a bunch of quick AAs?

All of the above.  In-game advancement is the device that gives me some way to
decide what to do, and to choose among the fun things that are available to
me.

>endgame zones had challenging mobs, no loot, no pp, and no xp... you and 
>all your friends would still be there taking them out?

Probably not, unless it had some other maguffin for motivating us and our
characters to do it.  When you go see a movie, what advancement or gain do you
expect to get from it?

>Loot and advancement *are* self-assigned challeges.

Oh, good, we agree.  Why would they become meaningless, then, if someone
else got a similar item by selling a kidney rather than camping a spawn?

>You don't need better gear to have fun killing mobs. Better gear just
>lets you have fun killing different mobs. 

Yes.  And to a great degree it increases the sense of overcoming a challenge,
which I really enjoy.  To some extent this is a false perception, as the
better gear reduces the risk, but it's still a thrill for me.

>But there is nothing inherently special about the 'new mobs' that makes

They take different game mechanics, different levels of teamwork, and you
get to see bigger meaninless numbers fly across the screen (ooh!  nice
crit!).  And they drop better items, which is a nice bonus and a leadin to
yet the next level of targets.  This is handy for those of us who prefer not
to spend a lot of money on a game.

>But if you are buying the items then you've just defeated any 
>possible reason you would have for wanting to kill the new mobs.

No, you've defeated one reason.  Others remain.  Whether those others are
enough to sustain your interest in a game is unknown, and will vary by game
and player.  

I'm not even saying that I personally would enjoy paying my way through (part
of) a game.  I like the fun and challenge of getting my own items.  I just
don't resent people who don't like that, and get their fun out of the
game some other way.

And I certainly don't demean anyone who wants to skip PART of the grind.  The
truly high-end stuff in EQ is all no-drop, so equipping yourself with
store-bought items is at best a shortcut, letting you skip a portion of the
game you find boring, while the next part is still available to be played.
