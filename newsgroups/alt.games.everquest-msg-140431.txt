Well, that's the chief bonus I see for us wizzies anyway. I like being
able to rebind myself near a favorite hunting spot or other out of the
way area. Maybe a quest mob I want to check on to see if it's up, etc.
etc.  Or on a raid, for druids to be able to bind on the spot to ferry
out multiple groups when it's over if not enough Wizzies are around to
TL.

Before, waiting on a spire to go back up and rebind in Shadowhaven was
just too much of a pain in the ass so I avoided it as much as possible.
Now I'll be able to just port to the nexus and zone into SH when I want
to bank, tradeskill, hit the bazaar, etc.
