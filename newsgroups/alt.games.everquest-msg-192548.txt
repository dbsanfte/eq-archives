Yep, if you draw batman and it looks like batman it is always
copyright DC comics. The same is true of Spiderman. If you draw a
generic superhero, while inspired by existing comics, it is copyright
you even if they gave you inspiration.

That works both ways, though. The writer of "everquest" stories ALSO
could not bundle them up in a book, nor could THEY collect their own
everquest art and sell it in a book as "Everquest Potpourri." 
Nor could they even sell any of it online via paypal.
They could if SOE allowed it, but I doubt if they would unless the
person's work was excellent and SOE approached them first.

I've not seen the work everyone is talking about, but if it is just
that crappy "screenshot" "art" that everyone does in sigs than the
point is moot. All screenshots from the game are copyright SOE, since
they are screenshots of SOE'S "art" of their polygonal models and
textures. It doesn't matter if you then take the shot and put some
nifty photoshop crap on them, they are still SOE's copyrighted work.
SOE allows you to use the screenshots for non profit, non commercial
sigs and junk. However, you retain no rights so if you make some kick
ass SOE screenshot character sig, with your Druid's name and I edit it
to put my name in then you can't do JACK CRAP. Well, you could but it
won't be enforceable since you never had any rights to the image in
the first place. You can't copyright what is not yours to copyright.

So screenshot "art" is pretty cut and dried, its the other stuff that
I'm not sure about. I think in the case of the other stuff it depends
on which forms SOE has copyrighted. For instance, I'm positive that
Firiona Vie's name and likeness on the boxes IS copyright SOE. Is my
druid's likeness in a mix of chain and leather armor copyright SOE if
I drew it all myself? I don't think so but I still could not profit
off of it while saying its an "everquest druid." Its similar to how I
could not come up with a new design of a batman costume and say its
batman and then sell the image. "Batman" is copyrighted.

I know that sig screenshot "artists" might balk at this, but think
about it. The Cookie Monster name and image is copyright Henson
Enterprises or whatever, I can't take a picture of cookie monster and
make some cool photoshop effects on it and rename it "Your Druid's
Name Here" and then sell it, even for a paltry "donation" with paypal.

I have seen some sig shots that do "screenshot art" sigs, which DO
charge paypal sums for them. They ARE breaking copyright law. If SOE
noticed they could say "hey stop that.." SOE might not bother though
and its SOE's business to do it.
