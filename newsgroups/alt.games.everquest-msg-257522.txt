I have a LCD screen with 1280*1024 resolution,playing in 
windowed mode I use /viewport 128 0 1024 768,field of
view is the same like 1280 1024,my somewhat old PC
(Athlon 1333Mhz,512 MB ram,Geforce Ti 4200),can not
handle the higher viewport setiings very well.
Graphic quality is the same in windowed mode or full screen,
I remember vaguely windowed mode was not playable some
time ago,cause text was blurred,but this was many months ago.
