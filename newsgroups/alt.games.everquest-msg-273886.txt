I wish you could learn to read, I said the word pussy was used there to mean
coward, I said the use of "pussy" for coward does not come from the use of
pussy for vagina.

The correlation between "pussy" for coward and "pussy" for vagina is the
same as "beaver" for working hard and "beaver" for vagina - zero.

It has not been shown to have derived from pussy meaning vagina at all, not
one citation has been given.  It's been asserted by dirty minded little
twits like yourself to be a two step derivation.

Now don't be too offended, there's a difference between twit and twat, not
that a twit would know.

I guess being such a dirty mothed piece of filth this makes you feel big - a
tiger rather than a pussy.
