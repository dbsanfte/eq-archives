Some quests that require a number of items come witha container. For examle
the Bug Quest (cant remember what ya have to get but its something like)
where you have to collect four bug items like fire beatle legs, egg sack,
wasp wing and wasp sting. They are then put into the container givern for
the quest. The containg has a combine button. Once you have all items in the
container you hit the combine button and hand the container to the NPC.
