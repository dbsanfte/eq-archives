I stand corrected thanks - (and I think that sucks too btw - I wonder how many
people who can do Time care about a type *8* augment.... :)!   Now that I've
found the "malevolent" amor series I've picked up several items and augments
that are pretty great for my cleric.  
I've also noticed that you lose 30% of the item's value if you *sell* it back
to the merchant.... I've only *sold* an augment back once, I'm hoping someone
can tell me more valuable items don't have such a hefty *loss factor*.
Since I'm not on FV I'm not sure how much that helps the OP though...
