Hi All,

Visited the PoG with a raiding party the other day. I just went to watch
(and hoping a Nature Walkers Behest would drop). I ran around the zone,
talked to NPCs, visited Tunare, was Amiable to everyone.

In between fights I would cast buffs and heals (including Chloro) on the
raiding groups. Never saw a faction hit. Then, all of a sudden EVERYTHING
was scowling (except the PoGs).

What could have made my faction so bad, so fast? How can I get it back?

I am a 52 Tunare worshipping Druid who was not grouped at any time.

Drywit
