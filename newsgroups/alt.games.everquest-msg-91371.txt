Why thank you!  :)
This group is a lvl 14+ guild.. they let me in because they liked me and I'm
only about half a bar from being 14 anyhow, so it looks like I'm the baby of
the family.  lol
They're all extremely helpful and I've already learned a wealth of things
from them... Plus, when they DO have a raid (they had one last night) I love
sitting and reading about what's going on while I'm doing other things on
the other side of the world :)
It's fun.  And, gives me something to look forward to.  The comraderie
between these people is awesome.  Feels like I just stepped into a
closely-knit group of folk, which really makes me happy since I was sort of
afraid of getting in a guild and having it fall apart a week after I joined
like so many others have expressed... which very well COULD happen but it
doesn't seem like it will.

anyhoo.  thanks again :)
