Translation:
This now gives us license to ignore your petition altogether if we think
it's not worth our time.
Previously, we had to wait for you to log out completly for your petition to
be removed from our queueing system, and that looked bad on our reports...
now we can wait for you to DELETE it in frustration and then we can claim it
as 'resolved' in our reporting system, thus improving our 'customer support'
figures.
Thank you for not calling Everquest Customer Services... please don't call
again!
