I was tnt 16 meg agp, p2 400 mhz, 384 meg ram with Luclin, all models
on, textures low, no old world textures upgraded. With a 256 meg dimm
i bought for 35 bucks when bought luclin.

At 800 x 600 had pretty okay frame rate except when several luclin
model players around me.

Added 256 meg dimm got for xmas (convenient ; )   ) Careful to 
point them to same location I bought the other one. So now using 576
meg ram or something.

Added Geforce 2 MX 400 64 meg card, 45 bucks including tax, new.
Frame rate improved a lot at the 800 x 600 res which I like to play in
(Buttons are just too tiny for me in larger resses)

Don't have much lag on my cable modem. Its partially your isp, your
route to verant, verant, more than it would be cable modem or DSL.

Yep, from my experience now its this order for an mmorpg like this
which is texture/memory intensive (especially with luclin) 

1) Ram, if like me your tnt 16 meg card still gets brand new drivers
from nvidia every other day so was still serviceable

2) Graphics card.

3) last of all processor, its just not going to make the biggest 
difference with new graphics cards and this kind of texture memory
intensive game with many other players on the screen at once in 
a variety of gear.

Since mine is lagging behind though and my current agp slot is only
2x, my next upgrade is an asus board that is new, 4x agp, can use my
current ram and a Celeron 370 slot 1.2 ghz cpu = 247 bucks or so. Then
I'll go the geforce 4 4200 128 meg in a few months when its about 150
bucks. Sometime in there I'll buy another dimm like I have now for a
total of 768 meg ram and use this old asus board/cpu 128 meg ram,
geforce 2 64 meg  for something else.
