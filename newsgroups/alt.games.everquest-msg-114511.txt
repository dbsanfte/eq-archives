My wife and I sit next to each other playing. She gets sounds from Neth Lair
and others I don't, and I get a few she doesn't. Her sounds include wind
howling in NL and crowd noise in Shadow Haven. I get better surf sounds on
coast lines and shore lines (same thing?)

I have an EAX Gamer sound card, she has standard sound card on a Sony Vaio.
I have a PIII, She has a P IV. Is it a setting issue, or processor issue?
Both have sound realism maxed.

Thanks for help with this burning issue. )
