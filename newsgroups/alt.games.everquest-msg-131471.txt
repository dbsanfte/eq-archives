I would be very surprised if the shrink spell works in Butcherblock.
Shrink, the spell, only works in indoor zones, and only on group members.
Shrink the potion is self only, but works in all zones.  I don't know for
certain, but I assume that Grow has identical restrictions.  For example, I
can use a shrink potion to make myself smaller so that I can go in and out
of buildings in Kelethin or Firiona Vie, I cannot use a shrink spell to do
the same, as they are outdoor zones.  The Grow spell is sometimes asked for
by small tanks who want to be able to see, and is also used to counteract
the Shrink spell.
