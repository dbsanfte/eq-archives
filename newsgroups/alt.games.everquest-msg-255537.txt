Heh, I actually look for these.  As a Ranger/Necro I search out the
tough but soloable mobs with nice loot or other rewards, if for
nothing else but to say that I soloed them.  Who else here has killed
a Nexus Scion?  (Only a Ranger can do it as far as I can tell--Maybe a
rogue with a lot more patience).  I also went on a spree, soloing
Priests of Discord just for the hell of it.  I'm still waiting to find
Gorinaire up one day when I'm alone so I can see how far I can get it
down.  And I think it is possible for a Ranger or Necro to solo
Lodizol.  Anyway, this is how you find this stuff out.  See what
others have tried and how they claim to have succeeded...

Now I'm off to collect the heads of those a-holes that decided to make
GoD named summon...
