So your citations show that it is a term used for corwardly actions -
EXACTLY what was happening in the explained situation. I asked you to
provide a citation to prove that when used in such a manner (cowardly) it
has sexual connotations, you have not come anywhere near showing that.

Take heed of your own advice, read slowly, move your lips if it helps, but
try and keep your tongue behind your lips.  Now go back off researching some
more to come up with a citation which shows that describing a coward as a
pussy has sexual connotations.  Do you understand the difference????

If "pussy" used as slang for coward does have such connotations for you,
well go drop in on the good folk at your local gay community and maybe they
can put you straight one way or the other.


Now if you wish to totally demonstrate your inability to comprehend things,
go ahead and espouse that the etymology of one definition is the same for
all.  I suppose the etymology for pussy = kitten is the same as far as
you're concerned too.  Better lock up the cats because they're not safe from
you.
