Until I hit 52, I could charm any even or lower con mobs, while higher levels
gave me a "this NPC cannot be charmed" message. This includes tsetsian flies
in PoD, who are always a few levels lower than 52, and since I levelled up
so that none of them con yellow to me I can charm them fine.

I have now experienced that the 39 charm is capped at 51 first hand as well.
