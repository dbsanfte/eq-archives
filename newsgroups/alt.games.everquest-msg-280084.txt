If you think WoW is more like EQ2 than it is like EQ than you have either
never played WoW, never played EQ2, or never played EQ.  Or perhaps you just
don't look at game mechanics and concepts in design and can't get past the
superficial race/class/mob names/zone names.

How was it marketed as different?  How can a game called "Everquest 2"
possibly be marketed as the Next Big Thing when the world is all too
familiar with sequels?  It's a metaphysical impossibility.

Again, "compared to" refers to game mechanics and concepts in design.  Many
games are compared in very general ways with EQ, purely because of EQ's
success, much like EQ was compared to UO.  That is a different connotation,
a comparison of markets/demographics, as nobody claimed that UO followed the
same design concepts as EQ.

Interesting.  So far the flaws I've heard (and seen) in EQ2 are the same as
those that have been discussed for years with regard to EQ.  Flagging,
separation of hardcore and casual players, gear/level dependance,
client/server stability, etc.  The mindset of Sony, illustrated in pacing,
lockouts, flagging, etc., transcends the actual mechanics of the games.

I can't tell whether you're one of those that will be purposefully obtuse in
a lame attempt to try to appear right in the face of the realization that
you aren't, or whether you're simply stupid.

If you really feel that an after-the-fact (re)action was the full extent of
Sony's planning, then you either have no concept of how corporations (and
the whole rest of the world) work or you really think Sony is the worst
run company ever.

WoW is *so* much like EQ, with the world balanced and the pacing tuned for
the "casual" player, that I, and a lot of others that I regularly talk to,
got bored with it quickly.  It's along the same lines of when I found god
mode in Doom, and never played single-player Doom again because the
challenge level just couldn't keep my interest in spite of the game itself
still being brilliant.
