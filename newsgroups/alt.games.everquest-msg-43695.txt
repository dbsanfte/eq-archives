PB overreacted, sure, but I'm still worried about their registration process.
It's not unusual for me to upgrade my PC at home, will MS decide not to honor
my registration after doing so, say, 5 times?  I went through the registration
process with a release candidate, and it seemed harmless enough (I believe it
asked me if I wanted to send detailed info to MS, to whcih I said "No"), but
still made me wonder about the future.  I admit I haven't read up on the
details of this system, so maybe I'm being too paranoid also.
