I don't think it was the difficulty of CRs as much as the sheer
impossibility. In a lot of zones, (trials and Ferubi) either you have
someone along that can summon corpses or you might as well not bother
to go.

Also add to that the gap between the raiders and the rest of the 65s.
They couldn't tune GoD to both types of players so the ones that
didn't have the gear got left out. 

Starting with PoP, EQ became all about the numbers and GoD just
continued that trend. The mobs hit so hard that you're forced to pull
singles in order to survive,  so except for pulling there's not much
skill involved. Either your tank has enough hitpoints to survive and
your group has enough DPS to take the mob down before your healers run
out of mana or you won't survive. 

It used to take 'skill' to handle a pull of 5 or 10 mobs and suvive
but now they've gone the boring route of making you fight one mob at a
time. You either have the numbers (hitpoints, ac, flowing thought) to
survive or you don't. Skill doesn't come into it any more. 

From my perspective, the biggest problem with GoD is that they pretty
much made it clear that EQ is a raid-only game at 65. Either I join a
raid guild or I might as well not bother since there really isn't
anything else left that I want to do. At this point, I'm paid off
through september, probably won't bother to re-suscribe at that point.
I'm just bidding my time till something that interests me comes along
(CoH just doesn't appeal to me). 

Rgds, Frank
