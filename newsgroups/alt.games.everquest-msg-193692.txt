    Stuff usable by yourself? Not terribly likely. Most things farmable by a
mid-level druid are farmed by mid-level druids, to the point that they are
cheap. But I can think of a few things that will make you cash fast.

    Spider silks. No, really. Check the prices on them some time in The
Bazaar. You can go to East Karana and farm yourself some nice cash.

    Bag of Sewn Evil Eye, in Lower Guk. Mob is up every 30 minutes, always
has a Bag, the Bag is a nice weight reducer even at higher levels, and
there's still a lot of people that either don't know the above or can't be
bothered getting one. You should be able to sell them as fast as you get
them for a couple hundred pp each time.

    Fishbone Earring. People still need water breathing items, and a lot
can't be bothered with the Katta/SSeru quests (or don't know they exist).
The NPC is easy to kill, but doesn't drop the earring often.

    Pegasus Feather Cloak. Sell the multiquest of it off to a mage doing his
epic. That can net you quite a bit of cash, although farming it for that
purpose is frowned upon.
