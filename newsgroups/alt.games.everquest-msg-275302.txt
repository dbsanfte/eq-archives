Capped AT is supposed help melees regain their senses quicker when they slam back a few to
boost HP and STA.  The higher your skill, the fewer detrimental effects.  If your skill is
at 20 and you've drunk mead until you've reached the point where you "cannot become more
intoxicated", your ATK and AC are going to be piss-poor until you recover.

Oh, yeah: one of the top guilds in the game - Brotherhood of the Spider
http://www.botsguild.org - requires that all applicants cap their AT skill.  I figure
that's reason enough to raise the skill.  :->

Yes, you're speaking of Terror Australis http://www.bad-sports.com/~terrora, who have just
entered the Elemental Planes on The Rathe.  They're a good sort of folk.

Best regards,
