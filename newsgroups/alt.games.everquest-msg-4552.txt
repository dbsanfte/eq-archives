Does this not belong to avenger yet.  I remember hi earlier saying that he
has trademarked this name and thought he said that this site would be his or
some such nonsense.  If you go by what he said earlier, it seems that he
would be trying to remove his own site.  Is he not LokariT, or was that
someone else?  I seem to have lost track of what his name is for this week/
