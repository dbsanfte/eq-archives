I had to do that when I loaded new OS's on my 4 machines....I had forgot 
what people had mentioned about the latest drivers sucking wind and had 
to go re-install using the older versions.

That was all prior to LDoN though, have tried using the newer Nvid 
drivers to see if that was the resolve to all my machines crashing but 
it wasn't so did go back to version 43.45

btw if it helps any all the machines are different speeds ( 850 to 2.1 
), memory (512mb to 1gig ), etc but all have Nvidia based cards from 
128ddr to 64mb sdram
