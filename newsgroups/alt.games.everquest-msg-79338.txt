Its not like one person is sitting there playing the farmers.  Its
usually a group of people taking turns playing a certain char. Or
logging in specifically to farm something.  

Or better yet, two computers and powerlevel yourself WHILE farming
something (ancient croc in upper guk comes to mind)

If someone is selling the same item on multiple servers, odds are its
a scam and you wouldn't have got the item anyways.
