I don't accept that generalization; seems to me that in even the gamey
games, and even outside of mmorpgs, the single strongest bind of
players is their guild.

Time played is always a factor simply because someone who's played
longer knows how to play better.

What I was getting at was time played as an actual almost literal
factor in game logistics, as it is in EQ. Right now we both know some
of the dumbest people on the planet have gotten time flagged and uber
equipped simply because they have been around so long and played so
much it was bound to happen eventually.

The culprit in this is the leveling system as it is in EQ. It's great
for gamey systems and can be made to work in worldly systems, but its
not ideal for it.

Better in this example for a worldly game would be along similar lines
to Diablo 2 exp system where you actually have to have some skill at
the game to get deeper (referring to parts of nightmare and all of
hell here, not the chump easy early levels). No matter how long you
play, you'll never advance in Diablo past certain points unless you
have the ability...

...or someone drags you through it. So again, holistic considerations
have to apply to keep this balanced. The system would have to be
designed for  this to work from the ground up; you couldn't just mold
EQ's system and hope.

The holy grail would be a system that rewards you more the better you
play, but doesn't reward you more the MORE you play.

This was answered earlier; the ability to grief should not be easier
than it is to defend against it. All that requires is more intelligent
play balancing than PvP games have done so far, especially when it
comes to crowd control type spells and ranged attacks. It seems that
games think they need to have mez and root type spells simply because
EQ has them (for example).

By making defending easier than attacking (historically accurate)
immediately strategy enters the play.

And finally remember, there has to be repercussions for griefing and
no *personal* benefit.

Yes!

However its easier to see if you take a look at tabletop roleplaying
games, like D&D of course. You get actually three distinct types of
players.

1. Those who love the combat the most.
2. Those who love the puzzle solving the most.
3. Those who love the roleplaying the most.

A person strongly aligned with one group tends to be totally bored
with the other two and doesn't understand the attraction.

Now the first two groups are obviously going to be the gamey players
with the worldly players mostly from group 3. I am not arguing here
that worldly games would be *more* popular than the gameys like EQ; I
think that is highly unlikely and contrary to everything I've seen.

But there is *some* demand. The problem is, as the original author
pointed out, this demand is no longer even being considered because of
the popularity of EQ (the best of the gamey mmorpgs) and *all* the
games are moving "gamey".

There isn't anything wrong with this, and you are jumping to
conclusions on the "beat up as much" by assuming too much is like UO.

A game can be designed where the small are viable, and even more
profitable. Diminishing returns, remember?

Warcraft was a runaway hit, and its design decisions are EVERYWHERE in
rts. Few try to break the mold - not because other ways don't work,
games like Myth and Kohan prove that they do - but because games using
other ways are more of an investment risk - or SEEM like more, the
truth being the clones often do nowhere near as well as their
publishers thought they would. The same is true of Doom. The latest
Quake could very well BE Doom in better graphics. It's not the first
that matters, just the first super success. After that everyone just
jumps on the bandwagon and variety suffers.

Horizons is the War Wind or SiN of mmorpgs. I suspect it will do as
well as those two games.

According to that logic nothing new can ever work. I also do not agree
with your assessment of PvP in games - it *has* worked but has been
hamstrung by not being taken far enough or by other problems, often
because the company can't decide to go worldly or gamey (like DAoC) or
simply isn't capable of doing either (SB).

One is happy the guy is not someone in a position where imagination is
needed. :-)
