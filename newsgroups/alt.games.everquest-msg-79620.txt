Still an option in NK, which is above WC level.  Also in Netherbain's Lair,
and I think Marus Seru...  When I'm playing a newbie alt, my plans for
escape include zone walls and guards (and now gate, since I'm finally
playing a gatable class).  Every option present in the zone is a valid one.

It's hard to carry the habit over to where there are no guards.  Figure out
a plan of escape before you start hunting, and you're fine.  If guards are a
viable option in that zone, then use them, if not, then there's nothing you
can do about it, habit or no.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
