    Sounds interesting.  I wonder if that will ever make
it to the regular servers.  And I wonder if that would 
be a good thing if it did.  It sounds like a clever way
to introduce an element of PvP on the green servers.  I
can see the annoyance factor being high.  How long would
it take before we had an orc pawn or several camping the 
newbie bind points outside of town?  A level 9 decaying
skellie where the path runs into the sand in Ecommons?
More than one of them?  I shudder to think what the CR
would be like when they annoyances have nothing better 
to do than camp lowbie corpses and gank them over and 
over again. 
   I wonder how it works.  Does the controlled MoB need
food and drink?  Can it be saved for later play?

           _all_ changes are good.
