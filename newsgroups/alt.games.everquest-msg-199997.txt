Out of interest, what race are you both, and what class is the hubby?

I've just restarted my 27 human monk as an iksar, and on the wife's account
made a halfling druid to act as a portable stack of bandages, gofer and
general squire. Both of them went into Kurns at 10 and paired up for the
first time. Every time the halfling dings, the iksar is at 80% - no big
deal, I just disband and solo the monk until he dings too (which isn't
long - gotta love Kurns :-) then regroup.

Here's a useful chart for xp comparison -
http://www.geocities.com/sstair/EverQuest/ - it's a bit old, as it still has
the "hell levels" but still gives an indication. You can see that the
fastest levelling combo is Halfling Rogue, and the Slowest is Iksar
Shadowknight.
