Much easier than Gorenaire.  Or maybe just that we have such high FR now 
that we don't worry about the AE.  I pulled him from the extreme NE corner 
of the zone to the SE corner, and I took more damage from falling than I 
did from Ragefire, or the two adds I picked up.  (I'm a very good outdoor 
puller, but dragons are still tricky.)

Well, it's actually plate class.  He has his normal loot table, drops a 
piece of Blazing <foo> of Fennin Ro, other nifty item, and guts.  Oh, I 
forgot to mention that he did drop 2 red scales.  He is going to have a 
shorter life expectancy than Sev.  /mourn Ragefire
