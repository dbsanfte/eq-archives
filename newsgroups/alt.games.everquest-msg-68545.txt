That has to be wrong, as the fixed the level cap, the have to
have fixed the top-end cap.  I don't remember who said it
or where I read it, but I'm sure it was an official source
who said the Beastlords are supposed to do the 2nd highest
HtH damage in the game (behind monks).  Given that, and the
skill used in the quest weapon, I have to believe it tops 
out at a similar level as piercing.  

I think I'm going to wait until I get DW to bring 1hb up, I'm
just not up to bring another weapon skill up from scratch right
now ;)
