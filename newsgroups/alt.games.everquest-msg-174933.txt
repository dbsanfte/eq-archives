There is nothing cheap about designing missles.  I'd like to know why you
think that it can be done cheaper than designing the defence.  There's also
the question of what can really be done to counter ABM.  I'm sure they could
come up with something, given enough time and money, but would it really be
worth it?  Wouldn't it be far better to invest the money in their own ABM
system?  The idea is to render nuclear weapons obsolete.  I think that's a
damn worthwhile goal.

The sad thing is, it's in Russia's best interests to get with the program
and start working on defense as well.  The sooner we can put the specter of
nuclear war behind us, the better off we'll all be.

It's not dynamite, mate.
