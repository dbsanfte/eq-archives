You know what? I would go with not thinking much of the player while
not letting the experience shadow your opinion of the guild (unless
you spoke to an officer about it and they blew you off.) I'm NOT in
a high-end raiding guild and we have only one required attendance
event a month and even that is 'required if you're online' and not
'required no matter what's happening in your off-line life' so we
(guildmembers) should *never* blow off our immediate obligations
(LDoN adventures, only-cleric-in-the-group, etc.) And if someone
does and it is brought to the attention of the officers, then it's
an issue with the member who has done it.

IMO, the guild here has done nothing wrong. (Again, unless you talked
to an officer and got a 'Haha. Too bad.' sort of reply.) The player,
OTOH, should have made it clear what their primary responsibility
was.
