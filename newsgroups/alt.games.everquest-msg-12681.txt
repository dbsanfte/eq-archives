I remember seeing rain for the first time and thinking how realistic and
cool that was.  What was I thinking =).  I also tried looking at the cloth
map I got and tried to figure out how to get from Freeport to Rivervale.  It
seemed that going through Nektulous was the way to get there.  Plus when I
found the Halflings in Nektulous I thought I was getting real close.  Funny
thing is that I wasn't killed by a dark elf guard when I was there,  I was
killed by a pirahna in the water which had to be level 50 hehe =).
