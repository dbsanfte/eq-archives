I can't say I remember it all fondly but it was an adventure when Prexus
went live waiting for boats as a primary means of transportation. I remember
being binded in Freeport and talking to someone in Qeynos and forgot to hit
the return first to get the chat line to appear. That's the day I switched
the auto attack key to `.  Long scary run for a naked level 12 Paladin to
run. The days of getting ripped off by consenting a group member to loot
your corpse and never seeing them again.
