Lance gets it. You must have been told to say that by Rush Limbaugh
too. That stupid crack (from newshound007) always amazes me, when you
say capitialist, some-dumb-liberal person tell you Rush Limbaugh told
you to say that.

Actually an arguement in economics is zero sum or non zero sum "game".
This means do you have an infinite market or is the market limited.

I would argue that commodity captialism in a pure form is a non zero
sum "game". I can't think of any good zero-sum commodity markets,
unless you count unique markets, for example, antiques from 1700-1750,
but that isn't really a commodity.

I think there is an infinate supply of things to sell. Granted there
is a finite amount of a SINGLE thing to sell, but there is always a
replacement for that single thing, and a raplacement for that. The
price fluctuates, supply and demand.

People will always have something to sell their fellow man, if we are
reduced to eating gruel, and living in tin culverts, I am sure someone
will find a way to trade "Crunchy Cockroach Toppings" for a better
culvert. Unless a government gets in the way.

Capitalism lives. Rush told me to say that. Now let me get my next set
of marching orders, I ran out of thoughts to think.
