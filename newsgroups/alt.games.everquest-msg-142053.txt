yes but "most people" are clueless idiots who make knee-jerk
pronouncements like that.  As someone who has played druid shaman and
cleric into the 50s I'd have to say that despite the fact that you don't
like the sound of it, the lines have been blurred if this heal goes
live.  That is a fact, not a whine.  You want to hear whining, wait till
clerics get snare, dots for live mobs, aoe spells useful for quadding
and  teleports, then you'll hear some whining.... well  at least till
druids get a rez.
