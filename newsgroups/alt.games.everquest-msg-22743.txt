I'm not sure that's a great bard item.  Our mana pool is determined by
our INT, and if you didn't boost your INT at creation, a wood-elf bard
would not have enough mana to sing DDD even once while wearing this.
Also, the upgraded charm song (level 39) requires 20 mana each time it
is sung, and -30 INT decreases mana 258 at level 43 (which is where
bards get DDD).  
I would think this would be a good item for a bard up until level 39
if they aren't trying to get skill increases.  Actually, this may be a
very nice item for a mid-level soloing bard.  The huge boost in CHA
will help greatly with charm-fighting, and the AGI boost should offset
the DEX loss.  Find a mid-level bard and see if they are interested.
