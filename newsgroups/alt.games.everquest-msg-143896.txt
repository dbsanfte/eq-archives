LoL...didn't mean I wanted more...just that the spells they offered clerics
to appease them because they are intent on turning druids and shamans into
clerics are ludicrous.  I would prefer they leave clerics clerics, druids
druids, and shamans shamans.  I don't believe for a minute clerics were
meant to melee into the 50's...heck, past about 30 for that matter (if they
were, they would have a LOT more natural HP and AC along the way)...and
personally I think if druids and shamans want to be clerics, they should
play clerics (hehe, which is why I have a 53 cleric, 52 druid, and 35
shaman).  I think I would find it VERY boring to play all three the same
way, which is apparently where we seem to be headed.  Besides, as a minimum,
if druids and shamans get to become clerics, shouldn't clerics get invis,
levitate, and enduring breath...whoops, almost forgot...SoW too!
BTW, if the argument is the "Priest" classes should get to heal
better...where are the Paladin's improved healing spells...arguably the next
closest "Priest" class to a cleric...since a Paladin is all about
divinity!!!!!!!!!!

Laughs manically as the pot is stirred further =)...
