This may be old news ... was on vacation last week.  Sorry if this has been
beaten to death already. :-)

From CastersRealm:

Hi all,

Thought you'd be interested to know that we're adding in Luclin ports and
putting them on Test server this weekend. These spells will be available to
both druids and wizards as convenient vendor sold scrolls.

We've added a Nexus port for druids, and ports to Dawnshroud, Twilight Sea,
and Grimling Forest for wizards and druids. This should help cut the travel
time to the remote areas of Luclin, and it's something that a lot of players
have been asking for.

Take care,

- Rich
