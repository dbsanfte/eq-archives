Thanks for the links.. I use casters & allkhazam for info, as it is.. wasn't
sure how they faired in providing the latest news though.

Know what ya mean about the prices.. you get this nice new spiffy item and
look it up.. wow, it's worth 6 million plat.. then you ask around & check EC
and before you know it your lucky to get 200pp for the thing :)
