I was led by the voice to go to the shittiest liquor store in town that =
I knew of, "Ernie's Liquors"(it also happened to be the one that was on =
the way home) to buy some liquor and cigarettes. I was told to play a =
game, one that we had played before and one we would play again I am =
sure. I was told to buy bottles of liquor which would pay homage to the =
greatness of those who would drink them and to buy one for myself, one =
for her and one that we would both enjoy. I was instructed to look at =
every bottle carefully and noticeably show my enjoyment of them as I was =
being filmed and important people were watching. Anyway, I thought most =
of the bottles were pretty ridiculous and many made me laugh aloud in =
the store while the proprietor carefully and delicately dusted the =
bottles like they were wonderful treasures to be valued and loved. My =
favorite was "7 Years Old Blended, Old Monk, Very Old Vatted XXX Rum", =
or Old Monk for short I hope. It says on the back "Old Monk Rum is a =
form of the legendary 'Soma-ras' of India's centuries old scriptures =
homored the world over. Old Monk Rum has been awarded gold medals at the =
Monde World Selection since 1982." It makes a delicious gurgling sound =
when it comes out and dribbles out a little too fast which is good and =
has a greasy texture to it almost as though it is a highly virulent =
poison cooked up in some dank alchemist's lab in the 15th century. I =
took a little nip before work yesterday in the factory parking lot and I =
think it almost made my heart explode(I just added a bit to my tea) but =
I am alright now, so I guess it's no big deal. I think I'm going to send =
a bottle of this to Ittenger as he seems like the kind of guy who would =
be able to spot and appreciate a fine liquor when he sees it, much like =
a fine woman.

3 left. I'm trying to invoke my intuitive powers to figure out which =
liquor should go to which person and trying to come up with an idea of =
who these people really are. Diesel is not who I thought but I think I =
know who he is now, Wheeler is not who I thought, Ashton is who I =
thought

Diesel is kind of an enigmatic character who wants us all to think he is =
some tough punk with muscles and tatoos, when actually he is an =
extremely sensitive, creative and caring guy with a good visual sense. =
Ah I know who he is now, although I don't understand how that could be =
possible and is actually quite frightening, but perhaps after spending =
time with me he was empowered and enlightened by the experience a good =
worthwhile beating can bring at the hands of Agyon. Anyway, some one =
like that would except only the finest of brandy or liquors crafted by =
the most respected families and blessed by archbishops wielding crooks =
shood in iron on both ends and composed of the darkest cedar and oak =
with which they shall rule Rome, which is as a twinkle in Satan's eyes. =
I think he would appreciate a fine libation such as "Romana Black, =
Liquore Di Sambuca" Romana Black is an exceptionally smooth liqueur by =
the makers of Romana Sambuca. Romana Black is made in Rome by the =
Pallini family, master blenders of fine liqueurs since 1875. Romana =
Black has an intriguing dark color and delicious, rich taste which =
captures the spirit and allure of the Roman night. Enjoy Romana Black =
straight up, or as a complement to your espresso or cappuccino.=20

The third is a bottle of Hot Damn!, 100 which I think is Ashton's =
favorite or one of his favorite's so I think he will like that, =
hopefully we can start writing the script while being embraced by it's =
influence.

The fourth for Wheeler or Johnson or whoever is a bottle of Jack =
Daniels, Old Time, Old No. 7 Brand, Quality Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey, =
which is the best and generally liked by everyone, much like he is.

So let's do it, I'll pretend that I am an executive producer,and if I =
have to I will do what ever else needs to be done even though I am not =
the best at any aspect of film production maybe the worst actually. =
Hopefully there really is an Ittenger out there somewhere and it is not =
me because my brain is so fucked up from years of emotional abuse and =
neglect, heavy drinking and neuroleptic damage that I could never direct =
a film. I guess Diesel/Gonzales should be the cinematographer? Maybe I =
should take a quick directing class at De Anza? I might be able to still =
get in.

I gotta get my daily walk in not for weight loss but just to get out of =
the house and relax where I have to smoke a cigarette even though I =
don't smoke.

Shooting starts April 14th, Initial script will be written by me and =
Ashton which will be sent to Wheeler who will send it to Gonzales where =
they can modify it to their purposes. Hopefully we can all meet at some =
time, I think we all live in California except Wheeler who lives in =
Washington I believe, the whole fate of this project lies in whether I =
can find his address I think, that is the only thing that could possibly =
go wrong in my opinion everything else cannot fail.

An equal collaboration of 4 people is a good way to create art, the band =
Queen is a decent model. Seemed like Mercury and May were the leaders, =
Mercury was the chaotic artistic genius, May was the quiet sensible =
logical perfectionist who was not really that talented but seemed to be =
important, kind of a stabilizing factor who probably added technical =
innovations and perhaps was kind of a guide for them to follow. I think =
the bass player's name was Deacon wasn't it, he wasn't very visible but =
I remember that the songs credited to him were often my favorite =
although basic, which shows that he was probably largely responsible for =
their song writing. Then there is the last guy whose name I actually =
can't remember(oh alright I'll look it up and give it the respect it =
deserves) Roger Taylor, the "pretty" boy of the band I guess, who I can =
assume maybe had a lot of money to contribute and knew a lot about =
music? I don't know I'm don't really know anything about Queen was all =
about, I'm just speculating.

So if there is an Otto(shit i guess ill look that up too)I cant find =
anything about him so the guy doesn't exist somebody must have been =
trying to emulate my style and goad me into action by portraying me as a =
whiny little alcoholic toady who can't see, who never stops complaining =
and seems to just spout out a stream of nonsensical mystical shit, then =
I guess that would be me. So I guess we will make our first film =
together even though two of  us don't really know anything about =
filmmaking, Ashton seems to think you don't need to "know" anything =
about filmmaking to make a good film and I would tend to agree but it is =
nice to "know" about film to make a successful film.

So then we got wheeler, gonzales, gumaer and ashton making a movie every =
year and spending the rest of our time hanging out on the beach and =
playing the various iterations of Everquest or whatever. How long does =
it take to make a movie these days? I'm not from this version of =
reality, it used to take about 3 months to make a film and you had to =
actually shoot the films outdoors with cameras with actors, is that =
still done today? I've heard that films can be made entirely in =
computers today? That was not possible in the world that I came from =
which was dated the same.

Well, I gotta go for a quick walk then go see my new shrink, then I =
guess try to call Ashton and see if he is the Ashton I know or the one =
of this dimension, if he is the one I know then I'll rent one of his =
movies and watch it with him and see what he thinks about it, then tell =
him my idea, then hopefully start work on our concept which will =
hopefully be done in a month or so, or maybe will be done tonight I =
don't know, ideas seem to flow out of him freely like gifts that he =
doesn't realize how precious each one is.=20

bye     =20
