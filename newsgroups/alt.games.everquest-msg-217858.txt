Haabbes the 56 beastlord would very much like a proc effect on his snazzy
new weapon, which will accept a Type 4 augment. Looking at what I could
acquire with my LDON points, I see these:

Rejuvenating Bone Fragment. Lore, Effect:Vampire Talon(combat). It's a
50-point lifetap proc. Costs 340 Mistmoore points.

Warm Emerald Shard. Lore, Effect:Heated Blade (combat),
Restrictions:WeaponsOnly. It's a 50-point fire-based proc. Costs 40 Tak
points.

Why such a drastic cost difference -- 340 points for the lifetap, only 40
for the fire, doing the same damage? Are there really that many mobs with
high fire resistance, or is there some other advantage to the lifetap one?
