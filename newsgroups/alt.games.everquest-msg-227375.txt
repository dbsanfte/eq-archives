DKP is bad and evil and bad.

Having said that, it's not so bad.  =)  It just has potential to be
exploited.  Many guilds enforce a "forced rot" policy - that is, if no one
bids on a piece of loot, it rots and no one gets it.  That's to keep people
from not spending DKP and then being awarded a drop.  Some guilds, rather
than see loot rot, force people to spend DKP and loot, which makes for
unhappy people who may have been saving their DKP for something else.

Also, DKP doesn't take into account the best usage for a guild.  For
example, a Blade of War has an anger proc that makes it the dream weapon for
warriors whose whole job it is to keep aggro as much as possible.  Yet, with
DKP, a ranger could outbid a warrior, even the guild's Main Tank, and have
their very own Blade of War.  That's just not right.

Of course, some people use a combination of DKP and officer judgment.  In
the above example, officers may say that only warriors can spend DKP on a
Blade of War.  But you're just one step removed from a merit system anyway,
why not go the whole way?

My Time-flagged guild uses an officer council to award loot.  Certainly they
have tools to help them - one database keeps track of who's been awarded
what and how long ago, another database keeps attendance figures so that
officer can determine how active everyone has been in raiding.  But they
temper those numbers with other factors, like what would benefit the guild
as a whole - Blades of War to warriors first, nuke damage focii to wizards
over clerics, etc.  They also use other intangibles, like who's been trying
to help people outside of raids, have they been drama queens, etc.

Obviously this takes a lot more effort on the part of officers.  Sometimes
loot awards can take a long time - in one famous instance, AHR's essence was
looted with less than a minute on the corpse.  But overall the guild's needs
are balanced pretty well.  There are some minor gripes here and there, but
overall people in the guild are very happy with the loot system.

If you don't mind the burden of keeping track of loot and getting into some
interesting loot council decisions, I myself would recommend just doing
merit-based officer awards.

Others will disagree; I'm certain there will a rebuttal or two to the above
opinions.  =)
