FD is one of those tricky spells (abilities for monks) to master, but the
ones who are good at it, can pull like none other.

FD works different once the mob reaches 35.  If you succeed, the mob will
walk back to his spawn spot.  If you get up before he gets there, there is
an 80% (?) chance he will come back.  If he reaches his spawn and you get
up, there is a 90% (?) chance he will NOT come after you (note: These %'s
may not be exactly right, I can't remember)

This is why he said to keep trying it over and over.  You are simply playing
the percentages and hoping the mob hits that 20% range eventually where he
forgets about you.  He probably called you lame because he wasn't sure
himself why it worked that way  ;-)

As far as /q... that's just an easy way to get him off your back.  Wipes his
hate list pretty fast, but now you have to relogin and hope you are safe.

There is a technique called tag FD.  Works best with 2 PC's that can both
FD.  The trick is to have the first aggro the mob(s), then FD.  When the
mobs walk back home, the 2nd PC hits one of them to draw just the one back.
The key is to hope the mobs spread out some so they both don't come after
you, or that the 2nd is still mad at the first puller.  If they both come,
the 2nd FD's and the 1st one gets up and tries the procedure again.

One problem with this is the original puller sometimes has to stay FD the
whole round of battle.  Since he is on the 2nd mobs hate list, he doesn't
want to get up and pull that mob while the first one is engaged.  This is
another spot to do the /q and come back.  An advantage though... the first
puller can simply get up and if the group has finished the first mob off,
voila... instant pull.

I personally don't like /q as it feels like cheating and you are no longer
in your group so there goes your experience and you have the trouble of
regrouping again.  ;-)
