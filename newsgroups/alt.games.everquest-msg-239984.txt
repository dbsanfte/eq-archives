Interesting.  I'd like to try this Outlook Express thingy.  You're sure 
it's preinstalled?  I can't seem to find it on my IRIX box, here.

Other people may similarly not be using Winblows.

Not that I like gateways or anything.  Don't get me wrong.  But Ogmuk does 
have the grain of a point in there somewhere, that's not quite that easily 
dispelled.

Technically, you might say I use a gateway.  But my gateway is based on 
telnet or ssh, depending. :)
