The price of items you buy as well as the price of things you sell to
venders is very dependent on your CHA.  I would recommend that anyone buy a
pair of Ruby Encrusted Steins and put them in your hands whenever buying or
selling anything.  They will pay for themselves probably the first day.
Good luck!
