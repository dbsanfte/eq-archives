I don't think Rogues are as bad off as Warriors. However I do feel both 
are a lot worse off than classes such as Monks, who can solo very well 
and are also very sought after in groups and high level raids. Why 
should Monks get mend and Rogues and Warriors not? Non-twinked Rogues 
and Warriors are useless without groups.

I think one very simple solution to improving the Rogue and Warrior 
classes is to let them bind wound to at least 75% HP.
