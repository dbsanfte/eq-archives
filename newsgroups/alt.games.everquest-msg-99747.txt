Don't name it \temp.  My programs have been known to check which drive has
the most free space, and put temp files there, so if I were to do something
so unfriendly as to name my temp directory "temp", my programs would not be
defeated by your simple ruse. :-)

(I obey the rules and ask the system for a name that is not currently used.
If I need to use a hard coded name, I generate a UUID and use that.  If you
name your family photos directory C:\7f818edc-310e-4148-965b-120dfee770ad, I
have no qualms at all about stomping all over it. :-)).

As far as your specific case goes, all hope is not lost, if the kid is not
much older than 4.  Just give him a bonus birthday party, take new photos,
and put those in your album.  Sure, you'll know that those aren't the *real*
4th birthday party photos, but later, when you are old enough to spend a lot
of time looking back at old photos, you'll be old enough to not be able to
remember that they aren't real. :-)
