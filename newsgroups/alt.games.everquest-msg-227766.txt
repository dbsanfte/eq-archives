The quests will give you flags that apply to the charm, you dont need to
kill all the bosses. I have every plane flag but Sol Ro and have only killed
Grummus (still done the quest twice for others). If you have a guild and
people to play with its not a bad idea to do the quests, the end result
charm is a very very very nice item.

Also minis for BoT quest are not difficult. Nowhere near the level of
AerinDar, MB, Grummus, Terris Thule, ect ect. Very achieveable for a growing
non-uber guild.
