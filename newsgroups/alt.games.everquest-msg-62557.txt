I never said they did. I was merely using the example of another high
ratio / high delay weapon, which is viewed only as a toy by the people
who's job as a warrior is counted upon by several groups of people at
once

Damage bonus is a modifier added to every single attack by your primary
hand, both 1h and 2h. I believe it's 11 extra on 1hs for a L60 warrior
and scales from there. That's 11 every swing. Lower delay, more times it
is added. Not all warriors have primals, but all warriors should
understand the basic rules governing what makes weapons effective, if
they are going to try to argue with someone about that subject
