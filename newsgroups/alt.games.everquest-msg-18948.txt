Oh, I forgot to mention, I can think of a couple of questable magic
weapons obtainable round about your level.

Bloodforge Hammer:
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=641

You have to kill Trumpy Irontoe (level 5 rogue) in Qeynos (get him to
run outside the bar he is in by asking him 'Who is Sragg?' or somesuch,
and kill him when he gets as far as a nice quiet back alley). That is
easy enough, but to get the quest reward you must take his head to
Kaladim, which is on the other side of the world. If you /ooc
occasionally on the way, asking if anyone is porting to Butcherblock and
would they mind taking a poor newbie along for the ride, you might blag
a free teleport there, but please don't beg and spam for one or you
definately won't get one...

You may also need to raise faction with the quest giver to get the
hammer - handing in a few Crushbone belts from orcs in GFay should do
the trick.

The hammer is 2HB, dmg13, delay 50, save vs magic +10



Fang of the Wolf:
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1026

Collect lots of 'a patch of gnoll fur'. Combine four in a sewing kit to
make 'a gnoll fur patch', combine 4 of them to make a gnoll fur quarter,
combine four of them to make a patched gnoll fur bundle, which can be
used as a crappy cape or traded in for a fang of the wolf.

So you need 64 patches of gnoll fur in all and good enough tailoring to
make the combines (they trivial quite low, about skill 30 or so I
believe). That would be real tedious to collect, but if you're hunting
in Blackburrow anyway you may as well hang on any fur you find -
especially since most people leave the patches to rot on the corpses.

The weapon is Piercing, dmg 5, delay 26, barbarian only. Not very good
really, but it is magic so you can hit wisps etc.
