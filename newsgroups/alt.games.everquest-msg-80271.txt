I really wonder about this "active character" bollocks. I remember that 
in the old times, you could be disconnected or dropped to the desktop, 
re-start the game, choose a server and fling back to whatever you were 
doing, without even going back to the character selection screen, as long 
as you did it while your character was still active.
