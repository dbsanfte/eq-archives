It depends, in my opinion.  If you mean a dark elf roleplaying evil,
killing halflings and so forth, then yes, you're right.

But if you mean good races killing other good races, simply because
they're blue and may provide good loot, or people who try to cheat
other players in the game, then I don't agree.

Their defense is usually "It's just a game" too.  Or "I'm
roleplaying."

I'm am suspicious of those who behave well in real life but like
dickheads in a game.  It suggests that the anonymity provided by the
game allows them to behave as they actually wish they could in real
life if there weren't the possibility of getting caught.

One should behave well because one believes it's the right thing to
do, not because one fears the consequences of getting caught behaving
badly.
