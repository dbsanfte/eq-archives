There might be a level issue; at 45 my cleric was killing wyverns solo 
at ally (I hunted there in group from 42, but wasn't yet ally at that 
level) and definately could get adds if pulling one from next to his 
buddy.  That was back in the bad old days when the lull line was just 
another way to pull without doing damage.

I stopped hunting wyverns long before hitting 56, as I'm no fan of 
killing light blues, but other characters I've played, including my 
recent foray into Berserkerdom, have proven what I've read about level; 
at 55 I couldn't pull a single from one of the rooms in POJ, at 56 using 
precisely the same techniques, I could get a single every time.

None of this, though, addresses Tim's point, which is that since he was 
having trouble doing things one way, he experimented till he found a way 
that -did- work.  I have to agree, this is one of the strengths of EQ; 
there is no "one way" to do things, and while there are many wrong ways, 
there are often just as many right ways, and its fun to play around and 
try different things and finally get a plan going that works for you.

If your way was "level up" or "get ally", well, those are valid 
approaches too.  If EQ2 doesn't give us a couple dozen ways to do 
things, and four or five that work, then its going to be a pale 
experience compared to EQ.
