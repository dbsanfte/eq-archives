Only someone who has never done any real dungeon-crawling or grouping
could say something so obviously asinine.  I don't wanna bring levels
into this, but the game is absolutely different above 35, especially when
it comes to risk v. reward.  There is no risk to 90% of the soloing I
see.  Sitting and camping a single-spawn that barely cons blue to you is
about as exciting as watching paint dry.  If you're going to solo and
bitch about experience, at least fight stuff that cons even to you, or
pull 5 or 6 blue mobs at a time, but since I NEVER see anyone doing that
(always bitching about the mobs greening out, so they're fighting stuff
at least 10 levels below them), it's all bullshit and bluffs.

I am so tired of hearing soloers bitch about how they don't get a bonus
for soloing.  Believe me, as a bard in my 40s, I know how to solo and get
pretty decent exp, but soloing is only something I do when I'm waiting
for a group.  Even if I'm taking all 3 IGs at the ent to Permafrost, I'm
still not getting the exp I get in a good dungeon with a group, but I'm
also not as likely to get killed.  (Other than learning to break the spec
spawn and a single death due to the bard drum bug, I haven't died solo in
many levels, compared to 5 or 6 deaths in 1 hour on some dungeon crawls.)
 
If the only part of the game you know is the solo game, you're never
going to experience the true fun of trying to take down dragons and gods
and other creaures that require a bit more than a mechanical root, dot,
dot, dot, med, repeat or whatever you do.  I am not quite ready to do the
planes, but I often find myself the lowest level character on dragon
raids because I know how to effectively group, and know enough to ask the
right questions when I don't know something.  These are skills that you
will not learn unless you have quite a lot of experience grouping, and
the skill change based on the type and number of mobs and the group
composition.  

I normally agree with jaZZ, and have tipped many a glass of ale with him,
but in this case I think he's suffering from a rather limited exposure to
the game.  The other people complaining do seem to have played enough to
know better, so I'm going to just have to hope they find some nice single
player game to keep them happy.  (Talk to some necros in the upper 50s,
find out how many of them had to learn the hard way how to group.)
