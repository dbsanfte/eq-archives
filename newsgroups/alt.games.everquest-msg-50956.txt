Its not really the job of tech support to figure out the myriad of
assorted things which may be wrong with your computer. If you can't
even get EQ to get to the patch server (I and most people have no
problem at all) how can you expect to even install something new like
world of warcraft? I mean.. patching is easy.

It could be anything from having a virus to you or your isp running a
firewall that blocks ports EQ uses to patch to something wrong with
your windows installation. Its not a problem with eq on a system
running correctly.
