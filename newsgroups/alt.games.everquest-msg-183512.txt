Neither of those comparisons were "pretty darned close" or even
vaguely close. See, the "component" in both isn't easily available to
anyone with the money in unregulated, unrestricted quantities.

Any melee I play keeps a few of the level-appropriate gem. I don't
presently have a cleric, though.

The pet is one of the primary functionalities of the mage (And, yes,
the price of the component DOES matter, by the way). In most cases, a
fight can go perfectly well without anyone having symbols cast on them
if the cleric is even halfway capable otherwise... The mage's pet
enhances the MAGE'S performance. Symbols enhance the TANK'S
performance.
