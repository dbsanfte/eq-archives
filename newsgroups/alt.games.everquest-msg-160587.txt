That's mostly because "camping" JBoots isn't a group-friendly
activity.  The spawn is too rare and the XP too low for a
group to justify going to OOT and holding down the camp.  At
best, a group gets a kill every six minutes and there's no
other nearby spawn points to pull that are around that level.
That means people only go for the loot and, other than the
ring, the loot is horrible as well.  If you figure six hours
for an AC spawn, a group simply isn't going to be able to
justify going.

Still, that doesn't mean it *can't* be done.  It can; it's just
not done very often.
