You sound more and more like you're just tiring of the wizard and
wanting an excuse to give up and play the druid. Stop trying to analyze
it like a math problem. It's a game. Relax and have fun. If you hate the
wizard that much, go play something else. If you want easy leveling and
are now finding the wizard too slow, then sure, a druid's a pretty good
choice.

But just make sure you're not running into the syndrome that many fall
into of decreased level rate burnout. No matter *what* class you play,
after you get into your thirties, the levels slow down. (And that
includes druids. It will *still* slow down, just like the wizzy has.) In
the forties, it's worse. Post fifty, level progress is done at glacial
speeds. The days of knocking out a couple levels in a night or five or
six a week are over when you leave your thirties. If you want to go to
the end game, it's going to slow down for any class you pick.  I have
known quite a few people in the few years I've played who have *never*
gotten a character past the mid thirties for that reason. They just give
up and start a new one, which then becomes "more fun" by definition,
because they can once again go on a level dinging rampage.

Of course, if you really have no interest in getting to high levels and
just want to try out all the classes to the mid levels, then by all
means go for it. Again, as long as you're having enough fun to justify
the time and money you're investing in it, it's all good.
