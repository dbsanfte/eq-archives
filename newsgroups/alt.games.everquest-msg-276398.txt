He means the "Ward of ... " spells, not the "Mark of ..." spells.
The Ward spells are new to DoN and add a defensive proc
that damages the mob.   For the level 61 one figure about
1500-2000 extra damage a fight;  no idea on the level 69 one.
Basically think "riposte" on a cleric...

The Mark spells are older and are shields cast on the mob.
One is a minor damage shield (takes damage every time it
hits) and the other is a minor heal shield (heals everyone
who hits it.)   They both replace any damage shield the mob
has itself IIRC, making them even more useful.   The heal
one generally means you can avoid healing the DPS classes
as long as aggro stays on the tank (except for rampage,
AOE spells, etc, of course.)
