If you have the words, just get a high lvl necro to combine the words for
you. Bung them a few plat for their time, but chances are they will give it
back to you.

Im lvl24 and cant find the Word of Possession anywhere (makes lvl24 pet
spell, have the other 2 words). I have been auctioning for at least 2 weeks.

Btw, I hear the Lvl 29 pet spell can be bought in SK guilds in Oggok and
Grobb. Like the Lvl 20 one could.
