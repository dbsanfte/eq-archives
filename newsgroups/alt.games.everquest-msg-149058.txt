I  know you have things you believe and I hate to be the one to crush 
your dreams, so you just go right ahead and post till you are content. 
When you have found happiness in your posting, post about that 
happiness.  Just don't let yourself be deceived into actually believing 
what you believe and you'll be ok.  One's own mind is a terrible foe and 
I can see that your battles have just begun.  Good luck little soldier!

And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
