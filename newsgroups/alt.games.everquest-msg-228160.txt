So pretty much any PvP then, right?

Btw, I'm well aware of the easy stuff that the other poster mentioned in his
response to me.  That's not the question I'm asking.  What I'm asking is
where do you draw the line between "PKing with a purpose" and "PKing without
a purpose"?  It's not identifying the easy things where someone's hunting
down naked level 1s as they spawn for the first time, it's identifying the
borderline cases.  Like people complaining about being jumped after just
finishing a PvE fight, or any number of scenarios.

And who's making this determination, by the way?  In your ideal world, are
PKers supposed to explain themselves every time they PK someone?  And when
would you decide an explanation is bullshit?

And I find this rather amusing because I thought your point was that there
wasn't any satisfactory PvP going on, which would eliminate DAoC and SB from
your "PvP with a purpose" line.  If that's not the case, what's wrong with
those two systems then that requires the rant behind this thread?  I thought
the whole purpose of the rant was to complain about how none of these
MMORPGs are at all satisfactory.

And besides, if that's PvP with a purpose, are we thus demanding that all
MMORPGs from now on separate PCs into teams so when they kill one another,
it's got a purpose?

This was my first question about PvP on this thread, so I'm not sure what
"so much trouble [I'm] having" refers to, unless it's just a pathetic
attempt to try to dismiss my relevant questions because you don't have any
effective response.

You seem to think "random ganking" is objective, something that everyone
would be able to determine in any situation.  I'm saying it's subjective.
You've done nothing to convince me that you're right.  If you disagree, come
up with a situation a little more complex and ambiguous than some level 20
hanging around outside safe areas killing every single level 1 that comes
out and show me how that can be objectively considered.

Although that example can be easily modified to make it ambiguous.  What
happens if it's a level 3 killer?  Or someone of an enemy race?  Or someone
who plays an evil class?  Is it the level disparity that's the issue?  The
location?  The choice of victims?  The number of times he does it?  What?
Make minor changes to that hypothetical and it suddenly becomes okay?  Tell
me what the relevant difference is!
