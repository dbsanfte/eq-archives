I made my own Misty Thicket Picnic on my first try at 142 baking, lol. The
next 39 tries failed though.

The baking combines are easy enough to get components for that around 180
should yield decent success rates.

The rest you should have at 250 (200 for fishing) for decent success rates,
unless you want to use robes to skill up your tailoring.
