I was with you up till the last statement... no way in hell would I (or
could I) pay $30-$40 a month for acess to a group of sites. Hell thats more
than my DSL account with 6 static IP's.

Most subscription services I've seen pop up recently are between $3 and $6
a month for 20 to 40 sites. That's much more realistic, and I'd gladly pay
that if I didn't have to deal with popups, banner adds, and one bit of info
on a page full of advertisements.
