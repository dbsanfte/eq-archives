Having played on both Veeshan and Stormhammer I have seen a lot of *high*
level guilds. Fires of Heaven are certainly the most *Uber* on Veeshan, but
Township Rebellion on Stormhammer have to be (in my opinion) the strongest
and most powerful guild to be formed on any server to date. However, guilds
with this amount of power all too often give them a very bad name,
particularly in the case of Township Rebellion, who seem to be despised
server-wide at the moment.. To me, guilds of this stature really do take
away the relaxation of the game, and people are all too often *way* too
serious and far, far too greedy. Having rules that mean you *have* to raid
five out of seven nights will quickly jeopardize any relationship. Guilds
shouldn't (in my opinion) be so demanding on players. You don't have to be
all powerful to be a great guild.

Other guilds on Veeshan would have to be Celestial Tomb, The Corps, Obsidian
Guard - On Stormhammer Leviathan, Vexare and the now defunct Enrapture are
very amongst the highest level guilds.

Kind regards and safe hunting to you all ...

Stevie.
