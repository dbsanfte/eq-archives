I've upgraded my computer.  After much gnashing of teeth
and rending of clothing, I'm running a geforce FX 5200 video
card.  When I log in, the characters are missing features.  For my 
character in shadow haven, big squares of the display were all white.
Which made it difficult to move without falling in the pool.  
very odd.  any clues?  I'm currently running the drivers from
everquest.com and re-installed directx 9.0c after upgrading the
drivers.  I did a complete file load for EQ, too.  

thanks,

Robert
