 No, I think you're confused. Even without the timesinks I hate Luclin.
Really. I do! I have absolutely zero reason to go there. Well, now that
the bazaar is in (many months after it should have been) I'm sure I can
think of something. But I don't buy/sell stuff so it's not much of an
incentive.

 I hope I never see another Grieg fight as long as I live! Although I
think his ae was changed to be more resistable so maybe it doesn't suck
as much as it used to.

 Shei and Burrower are fun, sure. Yes, it's nice that different
techniques are needed for different mobs. But overall Luclin was
released before it was done and the content it has doesn't particualrly
interest me. Could they fuck the faction system up any more? I mean
cripes, 9 faction adjustments on one mob is ridiculous. I'm sure it
makes sense in their grand scheme storyline, but I'm not even sure
anyone knows what that is. 

 In my eyes, Luclin is a failure. I'm sure people visit there that enjoy
it, but I don't speak for them. Just myself.
