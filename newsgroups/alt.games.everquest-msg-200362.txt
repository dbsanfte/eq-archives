No miscalculation.  I don't trust the Magelo system; it has had my
stats wrong before based on my gear.  When a complete heal costs you
10% of your mana pool, you have about 4k mana.  You could conceiveably
have a little less; keep in mind, though, that during a cast the regen
level is minimal when you have no FT, no KEI/mana buff, and are
unhorsed, as I was in those days; therefore, one can't argue that I
was regenning to 90% mana at the end of the cast when coming down from
a full mana bar.

I've done mana calculations on friend's characters as well, based on
their items, and I have never known the Magelo system to be accurate
on mana pool.
