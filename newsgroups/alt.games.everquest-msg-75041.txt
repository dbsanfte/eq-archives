: If you have a GeForce(1) 256 as you seem to be saying, yes, you need to
: upgrade.

: Take a look at the differences between the GF3ti200 and 500
: (http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=geforce3).  I'm not sure the difference
: is worth the price difference.

: At www.pricewatch.com the 200s start at $151 (be VERY careful about
: shipping!) and 500 $278.

Actually there is no difference between Ti200 and Ti500. They use exactly the
same chips, although Ti500s might have faster memory. Out-of-the-box difference
is that Ti200's GPU is clocked lower than Ti500's, but if you feel adventurous,
you can attempt to overclock it to Ti500 speed, since the chip is exactly the
same.
