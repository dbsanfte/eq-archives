You are more likely to overdraw the power supply with the fans than with the
light effects. I have a buddy that got Le Case De Monstrous, with speed
controlled fans. 500 Watt power supply. You can bring up the voltage reading
for the case and watch it drop when the fans are at about 2/3 speed. There
are 9 fans not counting the ones on the processor and video cards. Turn it
all the way up after it is booted and the computer runs ok, but it won't
boot with the fans at full tilt. Which is ok, because at full tilt it sounds
like it's done taxiing and ready to take off.
Sounds like you got a P4. My current motherboard (AMD) doesn't need it, but
my most recent power supply purchase supports it... 550 W with a silly name
(Butterfly flower or something). It has the advantage of using a 140mm fan
instead of the standard 80mm, and is thermally controlled. With it and the
new heatsink/fan (120mm) for the processor, and 2 slow case fans, the
loudest noise from my computer is the hard drives now. And it runs cooler.
And of course, glows in the dark ;)
