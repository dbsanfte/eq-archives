TORONTO (CP) - North American sales of Halo 2 reached $125 million US in the 
first 24 hours of the video game's release, according to Xbox parent company 
Microsoft.

Xbox is calling the launch the biggest in video game history. Halo 2 hit the 
stores Tuesday in the U.S. and Canada, with some retailers opening at 
midnight to meet the rush. "The first 24 hours of Halo 2 sales have taken 
our breath away," Xbox corporate vice-president Peter Moore said in a 
statement.

"Across North America, 2.4 million copies of the game were sold through, 
representing $125 million in total cash register receipts for retailers. 
It's no longer just a huge game for us but has become a seminal milestone 
for the entire industry."
