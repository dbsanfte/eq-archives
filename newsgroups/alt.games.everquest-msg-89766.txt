I cast a STA buff on a tank, his hitpoints go up.
I cast an AGI buff on a tank, his AC goes up.
I don't need any parser to show that.

You can argue that they don't go up enough to be worth the mana.
I will argue that if those few extra HPs or AC mean the difference
between life and death just once -- and they can -- then it is worth it.
