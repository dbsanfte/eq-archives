I think Empathy may be the only power set that actually has the specific
power "Resurrect", but there are other power sets that include the ability
to restore characters that have died. For example, my gravity controller
friend has some kind of Mutation power that is a battle rez, it's brings you
back to life with enhanced powers for a few moments and then leaves you
disoriented for a few minutes. It's pretty interesting, and he's always
bugging everyone to "try it out". I think he understands why they are not as
eager as he ... ;-)
