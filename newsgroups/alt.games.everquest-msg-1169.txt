Pyzjn, like the AC, Quillmane, Grizzlenot, etc, are randomish spawns
with a variety of PHs.  They CAN be camped, BUT generally first hit
owns.  More about reputation, and less about Play nice. esp as they
wander, although, if you are hunting/camping one of these, what are you
doing without a tracker??  I'm guessing he was screwing with your head,
and you let him.  Camping a static spawn with known, defined
Placeholders will generally be more respected than camping a roaming
random spawn.  BTW, best way to spawn Pyzjn is to have 50 newbies
killing everything that moves in QH.
