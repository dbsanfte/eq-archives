 Money and gems/words/pages/runes/non-magical quest items.
Also, only humanoid non-undead mobs can be pickpocketed, and at
higher levels (50+) only mobs a few levels under you can be picked
(no pickpocketing the Froglok King at 49, for instance, although a level
60  wouldn't have trouble).

It is one strike only, it is no-rent (won't last if you camp or go LD for
more
than half an hour), and it will NOT zone with you.  It also actually poisons
the primary weapon "slot," not the weapon itself.  So if you've got a
Mrylokar's Dagger in your main hand, and poison it, and then find out
that you're pulling Silverwing early and don't want to build up _that_
much aggro, you can switch to your walrus tooth or something and
it's still poisoned.

Really.
