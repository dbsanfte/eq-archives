I started doing them at 32, whenever I saw one up in NK in between fear
kiting griffenes etc. It probably helps that I have 198 WIS and my
Warden of Tunare symbol (manaless root effect). I basically root/dot the
HG, medding until root breaks - this is usually quite quickly at level
32/33, and the HG will resist a lot of attempts to root, but so what if
I have to run away and recast root several times before it sticks?
Doesn't cost me anything...

The one thing to remember is to resnare the mob after a while - kiting
them at this level takes so long that ensnare is liable to wear off...
