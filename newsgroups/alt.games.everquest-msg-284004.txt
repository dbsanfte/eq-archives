	All we need now are Necromancer potions:  drink one, you get 
the message "You should manage your mana better" and the rest of 
your potions disband to go solo in Fire..

	Just kidding :-) :-) :-)

	I know the game's a lot different now...  When my clerics were
like level 40 not only did /gsay low on mana here get an immediate "holding
pulls" but people would constantly ask "How's mana?"  Now we just chain
pull red-to-70's and I don't even sit down... If I *do* say "Low on
mana"  I still get a reponse, only now it's likely to be "The ranger can
heal a few, just med..." :-)  The only people who ask me how my mana is
are bored rangers hoping to be asked to heal a few...
