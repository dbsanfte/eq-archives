Actually you should read it again...it mentioned a lot about non-casters as
well.

It's actually pretty simple, don't let all the talk let you get confused.
With Manaburn a wizard can use all his mana all at once for one big
nuke...that's all there is to it.

The trouble with Manaburn is that 6 wizards can get together and kill
anything in Kunark...anything at all (except in Veeshan's Peak).  That's
really bad if your guild wants to kill Gorenaire, Talendor or Sev (dragon in
EJ) for a chance at epic pieces...you can't because 6 people came by 30
minutes ago and killed something that you're trying to get 30-40 people to
kill (well, 18 people at least, unless you're in a raid guild).

So now a critter cannot be manaburned except once a minute.  So if 6 wizards
want to get together to kill Gorenaire it's going to take them 6 minutes
instead of 30 seconds...and chances are some (or all) are going to die in
the meantime.  Yay!
