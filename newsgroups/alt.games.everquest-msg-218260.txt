Nope, you've run into the crowd control problem.

As a shaman, you should not be slowing the mob until the main tank has
started attacking it, and you should let the main tank get it down to 80%
or so before slowing it, otherwise you'll get aggro from the slow spell,
and be dead quickly, especially at higher levels.  Never steal aggro from
the main tank :)

Let a bard, enchanter, or necro mez all of the mobs, let the tank and other
DPS's pick them off one at a time... you use /assist on the tank to get his
target, then do the slow on that mob when it is at 80%.

If you're an enchanter, bard, or necro trying to target for mezzing, I'd
suggest clicking on the feet of the mob, or the heads of the mobs.  Also,
using an overhead view (via F9) can make it easier to target a particular
mob.
