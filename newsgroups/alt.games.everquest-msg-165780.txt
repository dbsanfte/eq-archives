Well, to be honest with you, these days I don't see a lot of clerics
carrying thier epic.  Most have the summoned hammer out instead.

I know what you mean though...  51 levels of not understanding what friends
and guildmembers were saying when they asked if a "noodle" was available ; P

Hehe....  Looks like Reconstructed, E'ci's uberguild, is actively trying to
get more members, for the PoP content that requires a few more people than
before... they've lowered their entrance requirement way down...

--quote--
* You must be at LEAST level 60 to apply. This a minimum.

2. You need to meet the following "requirements" before calling your vote:

* Must have Sebilis, and Skyshrine key
* Must follow the faction choice of the guild. Right now we basically kill
everything but for armor we only get kael quest pieces during our ntov runs.
* You must have at least the Baron title to call for your vote.
* You need a right insta-click item that can be useable indoors. Coldain
ring, Shrunken Goblin earring are a few to name. You Must have one of those.
* You need resist gear. You need to be able to get all your resists above
100 unbuffed. If you need jewelry we can help provide that for you so talk
to your sponsor.
* You need a stable internet connection and a decent computer. We very often
cram 40+ people inside a small area, if your computer cant handle that then
your no good to us. If you know that you will have computer issues then dont
bother applying until you get them fixed. A cleric going LD every 10 minutes
on a raid and during every major fight doesnt help us out at all, make sure
you have no computer issues when you apply.

In addition, it's highly suggested that the recruit be able to meet some or
all of the following recommendations:

* If you have an arch class title you have a better chance at getting in.
* Having a Veeshan's Peak key or significant progress on the key quest is a
help.
* We prefer people who are active EQ players. You are expected to make most
of the raids, if you cant be on for certain raids let your sponsor know. We
usually raid from around 6pm EST to 11pm-12am EST on weeknights and 3pm
EST - 12am EST on weekends.
* Having your epic completed already, or if you are very far into it is a
plus. We do not set days aside for epic help.

And yes, that is way down. ; )   Pre PoP, a friend who was thinking about
applying to them told me that thier requirements were level 60 with 30AA
points for "essential" classes, and level 60 with 50 AA points for
"Non-essential" classes. ; )



> Tell me... what do post fifty clerics go for on e-bay these days? ;-)

Pfft... no epic, only a 90 percent rez?   Save money and buy the level 60
paladin ; )
