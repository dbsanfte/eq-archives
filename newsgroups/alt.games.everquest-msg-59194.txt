How to have two pets:

Summon a pet in Butcherblock
Wander down by the docks
find the "a greedy beggar" lieing on the ground
hail him
He becomes an uncontrollable pet, like a chanter pet.
He attempts to intercept all your pet commands so your original pet
becomes like a chanter pet too, completely uncontrollable.  If you FD,
however, the little halfling pet goes on his way, he's not programmed
to deal with a dead master like Gobn is (though Gobn will only hang
out a minute or two before deciding you've really bit the dust and
taking off).

It's an amusing thing to do, with absolutely no benefit, the greedy
beggar is level 1, so he's going to die pretty quickly for almost
anyone.
