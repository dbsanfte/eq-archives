Ok this spell was cast on me in the Tower of Frozen Shadows in the library.
I can't remember which MOB did it.  It was my first time here and I was a
little overwhelmed.  Noone in my group knew what this spell was, or what it
did, and a 50+ wizard that I was chatting with did not know either, and in
fact, had never heard of it.  It isn't really important at this point, but I
am damn nosy and I want to know what this spell is and what it does.  I
tried to find it on the list at casters realm, but no luck.  Anyone???
