I think Firiona Vie was taking part in the expedition to explore Kunark, the
mythical lost (combine?) continent with its dragons and strange hostile
lizardmen.

She was one of those establishing the elven outpost in the valley that later
got named after her.

I also think she has royal blood, daughter of some king somewhere...

(Or I am completely wrong)
