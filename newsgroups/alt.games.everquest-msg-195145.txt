GMT is Greenwich Mean Time and British Summer Time (Daylight Savings)
are different.  GMT is always the same and does not use Daylight
Savings Time.

So what this means is here in England it is 7pm which is BST but GMT
it is 6pm.  So if you have DST you have to subtract another hour from
you time.

Try doing a little research next time before you start saying things
you don't know anything about.  Directed to the original poster not
the follow ups.
