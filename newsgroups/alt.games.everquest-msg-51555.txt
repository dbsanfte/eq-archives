Youre short changing yourself. snare/rot/dot is one of the best methods for
killing mobs, especially at high levels. dot is way better than dd for
damage/mana ratio.

For anyone reading who isnt aware of this... a mob chasing you will have its
dot damage reduced (2/3 damage iirc), so the root is necessary to make your
dots work at full power.
