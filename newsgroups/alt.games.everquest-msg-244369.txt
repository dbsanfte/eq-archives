Question for anyone who has done him... where do you position your
healers and casters if your MA pulls him to a corner? We have tried
this mob three times now and wiped on all three tries. Our initial
idea was to keep our healers/casters at the opposite corner and at max
spell range but they are still being hit by the AoEs. Our second run
had the MB hit Silence AoE that took out nearly our entire heal crew.
Can the casters, healers be positioned in the hallway adjacent to the
corner the MB is pulled to? Are his AoEs Line of Sight?

Any advice is appreciated.

Spiders were not a problem for us, FYI
