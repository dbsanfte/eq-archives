Look I understand that everyone is having problems, well almost everyone,
and I would appreciate any time and support on my issue.  here goes, I
recently got back from a trip to florida, and when I got on to play eq I was
like wow these new graphics are great, then Crash to desktop, same thing my
next ten tries, then all of a sudden right after the server select I get the
error Eq game has encountered a problem and has to close, and it has
somethin to do with the eqgfx_dx8.dll file, but I can't figure it out, I
have repatched it several times to no availe,

thanks in advance for your time
