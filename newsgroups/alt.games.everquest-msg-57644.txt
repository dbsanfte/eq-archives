Yeah, there's a big tendency to inflate the numbers when talking about
the evil white people have done to non-white people.  My favorite is
the 12 million black people that supposedly died on slave ships.
Total world shipping capacity over the years of the slave trade was
not enough to try to move 12 million people, even if there had been
enough slave hunters to catch 12 million (there wasn't).

Oh, and the American Indians that were wiped out by the Europeans
weren't the first people to live here.  There were at least three
waves of migration from Asia to America.  The Indians the Europeans
wiped out came from the last of those, and their ancestors had wiped
out the ones who came before them.
