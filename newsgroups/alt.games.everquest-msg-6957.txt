Magicians have the best pets hands down.  Mag pets dual wield at 24, necros at
28.  The pets in the 30s seem to be weaker for the lvl then the pets early on
and the ones later on.  At 44 the age pets really start to shine, they start to
disarm, they reliably double attack (they will quad hit for 44 points each
attack) block dodge, repose and kick.   At 51 the age pets become really
powerful I can pull 5 hill giants in a row to my pet, it tanks then and still
20% health left, and the   52 lvl fire casts Wiz spells, and the 54 water pet
will fight like a rouge.  The mage epic pet will defeat a 55 lvl warr with
there epic weapon in a dual.  Some people seem to like the air pet, I think
there crap, you have no control over the stun attack so you cant us it to
reliably interrupt spells, they have a high AC do dammage shields are
ineffective on them they are always invisible so noone else can target them to
buff them and they have low hit points, so they get killed by spells easily, so
I cant tell you how they fight, apparently they are like warriors.

enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the
mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
