Forget all the morons moaning about quad kiting, as long as you do it in a
safe area and away from other players. The reason being away from other
players is not for the mob agroing on them as after 2 blasts the mod will
max out on you anyhow. But to avoid the bad players who see you quading wait
for you to take the health down a bit the steal one of the mob.
This happens all the time, you just have to accept it.

But Ive finaly started quading, DONT do it till lvl 35 when you can med
without the book. SO you kite 4 blast... run med a few seconds blast run med
etc... As you dont need the book ya can see when they are getting close.

First time you try it just do it with a load of greens, as its a skill to do
it right.

Snare 4, run round them till they all group up... run away, blast. Thats it.
It works.. but like I say make sure ya have the +wis items etc as the last
thing you want it to be right out of mana with 4 angry cougars on ya butt.
