Can anyone post what he was saying? (I know you know the name of the
song im talking about....if you wanna call it a "song") He's either
speaking Welsh (which means he wasnt a scotsman) or he was speaking
some Gaelic tounge which must have existed before the Anglos and the
Saxons had their way with the area. Ok heres a hint...who were the
Picts? Ive heard Pictish warriors painted themselves up in battle.
Sort of like in braveheart.....and how pre-luclin barbarian models
have painted faces. And red hair. I guess barbarians are scotsmen
after all.
