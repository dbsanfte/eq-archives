When I had a Zaharn's Coronet I found that same message and so I
did some testing.  For me it looked as if I gained the 20% when the
Coronet 'feed me with power' and that I lost nothing when I
'feel my power drain into the Coronet'.
Although, when the my power would drain into the Coronet it
never reported the actual # I had been healed for so it had to
be read visually using the inventory screen.
I did notice that I recieved about 2 bonus' for every drain.
Quick Note (that I just found while searching my logs)-
My Book of Obulus only drained when I was casting Minor
Healing or Healing.  Never for Greater Healing.
