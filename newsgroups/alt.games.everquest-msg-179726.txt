What I did was just take the raft from oasis then on to the "Bloated
(whatever the name is)" boat.(You may want to cammo and avoid the Ogres but
you may be high enough lev to kick there asses I cant remember.) and jumped
ship before it docks.Basically as soon as you zone in jump off and swim to
shore.Fairly safe this way.
