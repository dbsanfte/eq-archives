No, I'm saying I do play without any virtual risk. There's places we
just don't go w/o having a plan for CR set up ahead of time. There's
places we don't go if we only have 2 or 3 hours because you never know
if you could be hit with an hour long corpse run.

Actually, I asked you a question about how often you go to places
where CRs actually matter. I'm just curious how exactly you came by
that holier-than-thou attitude on the subject. Something tells me that
I've spent a helluva lot more time in zones where CR actually matters
than you.
