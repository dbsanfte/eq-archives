Do you know which dropdown list is the font one in game ?
I had same thing happen.
I logged in non-windowed mode. Brought up the options window and tabbed to
display settings.
I used the drop down list and selected something. Then I had text again.
If you don't know which tab and drop down list it is then ... no idea
