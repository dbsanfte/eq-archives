Round-about "fix" for "class xp penalties". Better group xp. Better xp
bonuses for "underused" dungeons.

Only minus: More xp lost on death by classes with xp "penalties". However,
this is offset by more xp gained by those classes to make up for their
penalty.

I can see where a lot of folks are going to see problems -- the explaination
is a little confusing for some. However, what I see is all good.
