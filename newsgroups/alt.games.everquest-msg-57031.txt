Sigh.

I don't suppose Verant posted anything about this anywhere, and
instead left the bulk of the players (those that didn't see your post
about it) to rebuild their keys from scratch.

That this sort of thing occurs is just one more indication that they
don't have a clue about good data design.

Thanks for the heads-up on this.
