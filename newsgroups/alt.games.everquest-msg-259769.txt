Shit happens. :) I've made a few mistakes myself.  One example, I was
in Hollowshade Moor and I wanted to quit for the night so I camped
what I thought was a safe camp site.  When I logged back in the next
day, instead of seeing a pair of guards at the camp, I was looking
right into the eyes of an Owlbear.  I was instantly killed before I
could even take one step.  I had to have someone drag my corspe away
later.
