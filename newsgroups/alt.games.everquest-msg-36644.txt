The attendees consisted of my guild and 2 friendly guilds (as close to
"allied" as you can be without the title).  We're really picky about who we
associate with and I think that if someone cheated they were hurting
themselves more than anyone else.  So, in answer to your question, it was
the honor system.  No one was out of touch though, we guilded everyone for
convenience's sake.

In answer to Ben's question, no restriction on class though going with a
necro would be suicidal.  Everyone went for either warrior for AC (I assume)
or rogue for Sneak.  Had I thought about it I might have tried a cleric, and
at the beginning of the race spent some time in the newbie area killing
enough critters to take the loot to Felwithe to trade in for Divine Aura to
get me through either HHP or EK. :)  Eh, probably would have taken too long.
