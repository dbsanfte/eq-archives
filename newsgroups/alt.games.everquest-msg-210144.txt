Grin,  no honestly,  that wasn't what I was going for.  It's just common sense.
 A cleric is *supposed* to be great at healing.  And she shouldn't have to be
level 65 to be good at it.  Nor should a ranger when it comes to archery.
(I started a thread on the ranger / archery thing a few months ago.  A google
search will show it... I was really bummed when I was told how long it would be
until my 50+ ranger would be *good* at archery......)
