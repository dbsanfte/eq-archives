Hardly.  Thefts of sold accounts by the previous owner happen all the time.
All the prior owner has to do is call up and give proof of their original
purchase... the original billing address, the account key, etc.   And then
either claim they lost the password or that it was changed without their
consent.

Basically, they have to trust you not to steal from them, because you could do
it at any time.   Considering you're already selling your account, in
violation of the rules of the game, I would not be one of those inclined to
trust you not to break your word *this time.*
