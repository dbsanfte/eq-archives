Howdy All,

Was on another guilds website and found some information posted.

Pretty much said that Sony was thinking about allowing players to pay
PP in game to get them into all zones except time.  The link lead back
to a sony website link that was 404'd.

Sounds semi bunkish.

Just wonderined if anyone had heard similar rummors or had already
heard this was not true.
