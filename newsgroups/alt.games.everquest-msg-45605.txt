Be careful.  There have been several people suspended or banned
recently for alleged hacking, who claim that they did not do anything
against the rules.  One of the things they all have in common is that
they had to repeatedly download certain files when they logged in.

Speculation is that perhaps they got a virus that modified some EQ
files, causing the repeated downloads, and that this is also what set
off Verant's hacking alarms.

There's a story about the bannings at eq.castersrealm.com.
