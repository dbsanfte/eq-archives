Moot issue,

* Manaburn. In addition to the problem described above, this ability
was never intended to be a way for small bands of high level players
to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more
appropriately leveled people. While this was not the universal case,
it has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it
became a large concern in recent months.  The concept of someone
looking to complete their epic quest via teamwork and overcoming the
odds, only to have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small
teams of players looking to profit financially from their power, quite
frankly, is not a behavior that we wish the game to reinforce.

In the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that
their ability points have been refunded. Please make sure that you
have fewer than 25 pooled Ability points.


Read all the nerf fun if you haven't,
