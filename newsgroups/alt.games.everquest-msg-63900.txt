It sounds like you dont have all the protocols listed in the Gateway
Computer. On your IBM, goto Control Panel, and click on network. Take note
of all the Clients and protocols listed. Now do the same with the Gateway.
If you are missing and protocols, you shouldn't be missing and clients, then
click on the "add" button and add the listed protocols. NetBUI, and IPX/SPX
aren't usually loaded with Windows, so you might have to add them. Make sure
you have file and printer sharing loaded, and make sure you list something
to share. Whether it be an entire drive, or a specific folder on a drive. I
prefer the latter.

You might also check to make sure that both computers are listing the same
workgroup name.

Once you have all that done, reboot both computers. Upon rebooting check you
network neighborhood. It should work them, barring your hardware is working
correctly.
