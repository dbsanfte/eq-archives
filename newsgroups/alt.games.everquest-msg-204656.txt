Drakkel Dire Wolves (? think that's the name of the giant faction
wolves in EW) are default KOS to all possible Druid/Ranger start
race/religions (last I heard you couldn't be an Ogre Druid
follower of Rallos Zek).  Also, as with many mobs in Kunark and
(seemingly) damned near everything in expansions since, the
Coldain Tracking Wolves will KOS you in wolfform.  So much for EW.

above.

Were the "victims" in wolfform?  After a couple of unfortunate
incidents I don't use wolfform anywhere in Luclin unless I'm already
KOS to everything, so I don't know whether the wolves in DSP will
KOS you in wolfform.  Otherwise, there's the usual suspect for any
unexpected attack or faction hit:  might they have healed or buffed
somebody who was on a mobs hate list.  This would includes mobs that
have given up because they are out of chase range, I had an exciting
experience involving "lazy agro" and a large number of sabertooths
some time ago in LOIO.  This last, btw, is a reason to show caution
about healing or buffing a stranger in a zone where you can take bad
faction hits, what you don't know can hurt your faction (this can be
avoided if you heal/buff random strangers only just prior to zoning).
