No, both cycle and attack on their own delay timers, and both hands will
train, proc and crit too.  Off hands suffer from no damage bonus, so you'll
lose some xtra punch with your weps.

As a tank, i usually use my fastest weapon in my primary to try and keep
aggro.

There are plenty of nice 1HS weapons out there, I suggest, if you haven't
done so already, train up your other weapon skills too, it sucks to get a
great 2HS, 2HB, or pierce and not be able to use it at higher levels.

Good Luck.
