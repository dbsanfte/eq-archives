My necro held "A Mind worm fang" fro many levels (20's to 40's) 10 damage,
22 delay and has 5 INT to boot.Should be around 200 to 300p, at least on the
Xegony server. I then upgrade to a Polished stone staff. Less damage, but
better stats and you won't be doing much melee'ing when you can get one of
these. I now use a Blood bladed dagger, which has amazing melee stats (wish
my ranger could use it). For the secondary slot, I used a Book of Oblulus
(gift from a friend) pretty much from level 5 to lvl 45, I tried a few
forgettable other items, but now at lvl 60, hold a Tactician's Bulwark.

Here are some items worth checking out that I think are probably under 1k:

Cerimonial Hate candle (100p on Xegony, great bargain)
A Mind Worm Fang
Polished Stone Staff
Stein of Maggok
Tome of Unseen Darkness
Eye of Kvaknak
Soul Reaper (maybe under 1k, not sure)
The ubiquitous- Crystal Grinder
Shissar Dagger

Good luck!

60 Warlock of Primus Nocte
