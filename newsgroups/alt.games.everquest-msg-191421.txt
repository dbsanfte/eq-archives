Words are for Mage and Necro research spells.  You personally don't have to
worry about them, but you can either sell them (some of the lower ones, i.e.
the ones you get off of lower level mobs, for like 1pp each, and some of the
higher leveled ones for 15-20pp each or more) or just be nice and give them
to any mage or necro you may befriend at various times.
