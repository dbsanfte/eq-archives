I am certain that the intent of the original design was that mana
would be used sparingly and casters would meditate to shorten the
interval between "adventures".  Think of PnP games that require 8
hours rest, or whatever, to recharge spellcasting abilities.  The
original Meditate (I've read that at first you couldn't even chat
while meditating) looks to me to be modelled on a similar ability
available to casters in GURPS.  The error was not in the design,
rather it was in the assumption that Everquest would be played as
a roleplaying game, when we can all see with 20-20 hindsight that
the overwhelming majority of the players treat it as a video game
much more often than not.
