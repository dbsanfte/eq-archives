In POK.  Hmm.  That might be the problem, I was foolishly LFG in various zones
where the wayfarer camps are.  If everyone goes to one zone to look for groups,
then /ooc LFG goes back to working well; since there are 6 wayfarer zones that
splits the people forming groups into 6 fragments.  If some of those are LFG in
POK and some in POT Nexus, too, well it just gets worse.

Personally, I'd think the best thing to do would be to make EC tunnel the LDoN
LFG spot, since there are no aggro roamers there and you'd get only people
interested in LDoN; nobody else but a few ornery level 10s goes to EC anymore
otherwise.  But if its POK, that works too.
