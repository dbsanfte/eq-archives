Thats something I've tried to convince some of my real life friends and
family of, that the bonds through the game are real.  My sister for example
was always going out, Sports Bars, Concerts, etc...  I chose to go kill a
dragon with 20 of my closest friends =)  The main difference I see is that I
wasn't driving home drunk afterward.

RL_Friend_01 - "Hey Tony, we're going to do *blah* saturday"
Me "Sorry, got plans"
RL_Friend_01 - "Whatcha doing"
Me "Dragon raid, been planned for a while"
RL_Friend_01 - "Its a game!"

What they don't see is that this game involves 20+ human beings scattered
around the globe being in the same (virtual) place at the same time.  Its a
commitment, to your friends.  If I had said "Me and Joe are going to *blah*
already", then there is no alarm, just "oh, ok.  next time".  I finally got
through to them, but in some cases it took them actualy talking to my "game
friends" before it sunk in that these people are just as much my friends and
part of my social life as the kid next door.
