Humans don't hit harder than iksar at any level.  The only damage output
difference between them is that, starting at level 25, the delay of human
fists is 1 lower than the delay of iksar fists.  This "delay bonus" does not
apply to weapons, and generally you will want to be using weapons by 25, so
it isn't very significant.

And probably most importantly, no regen bonus.  From 1-50 iksar regen at
twice the rate of humans, and it becomes even more of a difference after 50.
At 60, human regen sitting/feign/standing is 4/5/7, for iksar, 12/14/18.

I think some people give faction more importance than it really has.  The
only time faction really makes a difference past level 10 or so, when you're
only taking into consideration kos status, is when you're banking and when
you're traveling somewhere by running that takes you through cities.  Even
those situations are usually not much of a problem since you can just get
invis or sow and just run your ass off through kos areas, and as a monk
they're even less of a problem because of FD.  During your normal hunting
time, faction rarely matters, and even if you do run into a wandering guard
that's kos to you, just feign death.
