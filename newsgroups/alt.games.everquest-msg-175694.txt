Not intersections with each other, intersections between swords, shields 
and the rest of the body for every one of the animations. Obviously, to 
make sure they don't happen, you always have to animate with all of 
those turned on (and ideally, use the damn biggest shield and sword 
models that Frogloks can wield).
