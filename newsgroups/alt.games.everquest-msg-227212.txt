Can losing charmed pets result in failed collections?

I think it must be a possibility, as the charmed mobs leave no corpses 
if they die while charmed, possibly taking the collection item with them.

I had my baby enchanter running through an ldon today, and we lost my 
charmed pet a couple times ... there was a little consternation in the 
group as it was unclear if this could fail us.

If this is the slightest possibility... I would suggest SOE simply add 
the 'collection item' to the group if a charmed pet that had one dies. 
It strikes me that pets really should leave corpses, and even if they 
don't want to go that far.. clearly if the charmed pet died we were 
responsible for killing it, and should get adventure credit for it at 
least, if not loot and experience.
