Or, you could do what we had to do, and learn how to play the 
characters...

Back when I was playing low level characters, there was not temp, it did 
not exist in the game, there was no accelerated sitting regen, and you 
had to stand to bandage yourself up to a maximum of 50%, and I will 
admit, soloing a warrior under those conditions was tedious.  With all 
the changes they have made now, I find soloing even my level 32 warrior 
to be a breeze.  Given that at the moment, he is down deep in the bowels 
of crystal caverns, where, up til the latest hotspot changes, not much of 
anyone ventures, except velium farmers, I did not get much of a chance to 
get buffs on him.

If you want to feel like you are accomplishing something, take your 12th 
level warrior to paludal caverns and ding him a couple times in your hour 
that you have to play.
