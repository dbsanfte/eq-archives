I've been given a quest by Ziglark Whisperwing (a drake in skyshrine) to
deliver a note and 200p to their spy in Kael.  But when I tried to give him
the note he attacked (and killed) me.  Obviously I'm kos to giants since
I've killed so many to fix my dragon faction, but I figured that since he
was working for the dragons he must be on their faction list.  How can I
complete this quest and get the key to CS?
