When i quadded in BB (went from 39 to 46 in a 5 days of quadding), i 
only had positive experiences. The druids there learned to know each 
other, and you could usually see if the camps were free, just by doing a 
/who, we helped each other, and never had any problems with KSing of any 
kind (apart from a ogre who ran too close to Den camp and pulled it by 
accident on the way to the ring ;-).
