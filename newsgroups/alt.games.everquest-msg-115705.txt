Obviously you don't play a Ranger.  Anyone (besides genuine new
subscribers) who seriously wanted to play a Ranger would have at least
a twink by now to test the water so to speak so what do Verant do?
Yep, they add the powerlevellers favourite race.  Gee, cheers for
that.

Asslings have absolutely no racial downsides [*] and the b0rked xp
levelling *bonus*.  For the first time ever the d00ds might want to
play a Ranger or, more likely, PL a Ranger.

[*] Unless you count having problems with stairs, being regarded as a
probable crappy twink by any Ranger over 50 and looking ridiculous in
most situations from standing [on a box] to get to the Bankers in
Freeport to fighting *anything* at shin level as downsides.

The only plus is that they chose HFL and not GNM. /shudder.
