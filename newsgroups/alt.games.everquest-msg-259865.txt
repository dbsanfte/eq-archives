For you?  nothing

for me?  New lvls, New powers, not having to camp the same zone/mob for
hours/days/weeks/months and sometimes even years for that uber drop, new
zones to see, Getting all my powers to max effectiveness through
enhancements, and waiting for new features like Headquarters, PvP, capes,
and possibly new villains and powersets.
