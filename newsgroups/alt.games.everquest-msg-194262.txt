This will be fun.  We have 1 50+ monk.  No high necros.  No high SKs.  
Well, 2 monks, but he never plays his monk, and is rarely on.  Might be 
able to get him out of retirement for this.

I guess we'll CoH the FD Monk, the 59 Pally ( with DA? ), me ( 56 Chanter 
), 60 Cleric ( DA/DB, assuming it can be canceled ), then the 63 ( not 62, 
my mistake ) Ranger to start with.

Any of the 3 ways into the "Castle" from (A) funnel to the same place, so I 
don't think that would be the difference.  Do any of those 3 paths skirt 
the ( debuff? ) trap?  Where the hell =is= that trap?  Do you remember, 
TwoHead?  I never saw it when we did your Chardok raid, I just remember 
"seeing" it go off and Heebs not being real happy about it.

It surely would be a scary thing to do with 20 people - 10 of whom aren't 
used to doing things NOW and following explicit directions.  If for some 
reason we can't CoH in ( mage can't make it, etc ), we'll try pacify to get 
from 3 to 4, kill the guys in the room, then 4 to (A).

Thanks for the info.
