Oh, I beg your pardon.  I had mistakenly assumed that you were neither
lying nor sufferring from a severe memory impairment when you stated
"I sure don't remember martin, and I have been in this group for a few

Oh, btw, which is it?  I'd hate to think of you as a liar if there's a
disability involved.
