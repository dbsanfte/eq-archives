When I was soloing Watchman Halv in Steamfront I noticed he dropped some
ringmail stuff.. So I did a /who and saw a lvl 4 gnome SK. Only tank there
atm so I guess why not be a nice guys and give the armour drop away..

I spend 3 days in there and outfitted that little guy with a full set of
ringmail. He was very pleased I must say..hehe
