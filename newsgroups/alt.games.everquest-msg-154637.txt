I have been in a really great guild for over a year now <snip>

This is a really hard situation I am in a similar situation (not been voted
leader cos leader is still in guild) trying to keep interest in a guild is
difficult and at times your best efforts will fall flat e.g. I arranged a
killfest in SRO as a mass powerlvl/recruiting drive/hunt for ancient cyclops
with my idea being that -20's would be able to roll for the ring and then be
taken to rathe mountains to pick up a pair of jboots, but it was so bad that
we had more high lvls for the buffing/healing station than we had newbs and
the one lvl18 who turned up was constantly complaining that he wasnt getting
good exp. I tried to explain that it was not just about exp but he went his
own way anyway (dying on his way through oasis then complaining that his rez
was not coming quick enough). Anyway the only thing I can suggest is to try
and organise some events maybe appoint a raid organiser, just keep interest
in the guild going as much as possible.
