you are a sad person and if you think a 9 year old person is qualified to
make comment on a game like EQ. wonder what that 9 year old's comment would
be if you gave them, say a Ferarri? *seriously* do you think a 9 year old is
qualified to make such comments? Oh and the fact the comments where taken
from a IGN message board - oh please give us a freaking break.

why dont you grow up and put that dummy back in your mouth?
