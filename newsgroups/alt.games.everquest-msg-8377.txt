And it's not the only place. I was on one of the small boats going to Aviak
island. As I neared the island I released control of the boat think I'd run
up on the island. Instead I ran right under the island. I could seen trees
and aviaks high above me. Being bound on the mainland I didn't want to gate
out and have to make yet another trip to get back to Aviak Island. After
wandering around a long while I found one tiny bit of land that I could
climb up onto. It turned out to be a small bit of the shore line just
underneath the water, it was enough to get me from the underworld back to
the surface world.
