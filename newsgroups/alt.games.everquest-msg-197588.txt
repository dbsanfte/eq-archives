	Sorry, but that's not in evidence.  It takes some people a lot of time to
get flagged because they DON'T have a lot of people with a lot of time to
spend on their behalf.

	In my case, I spent one night (2? 3? attempts) with some guildmates early
on, when no one really knew what they were doing, and then waited until I
finished my Archery AAs.  Then when the leader of the E'ci public raids heard
me say I wasn't flagged he called a group together for the purpose; after
losing a clueless Druid it was a slam-dunk.

|To gain BoT you need 2 - 3 groups to kill named in PoS, to get HoH you need
|60 people to take down a dragon.

	Pickup groups in Storms will eventually join up to take out the nameds.
They're not that tough.  To get into Honor you can do a quest easily
manageable by one group.

|To get Plane of Tactics, you need a 2 - 3 group raid to kill robot dragon in
|PoI and then kill Behemoth in PoI factory.

	If you can get to Storms, you can get to Tactics; that's where the back
door quest is.  Again, one group deal, just a matter of camping rare spawns.

|Lets move on to Crypt of Decay. To get there you need to take a raid to POD
|and kill Grummus. Again a lot of time and effort, hard mob to defeat.

	Back door quest to CoD can be soloed by many classes.  I could probably
make a decent stab at it myself if I were truly psychotic.

|Same with plane of Torment, 18 man trial in PoN to get into PoNb to then
|kill to get flagged.

	Again, one group quest for back door access in teir one zones.  Hardest
part is probably getting the necessary faction in Justice.

	The back door quests won't let you progress into the elemental planes, of
course, but they will get you anywhere on the list of zones being deflagged
for experience hunting.

|Months of work to get away from all the fkin morons that flooded PoP 1st
|tier and then 2nd tier.

	It's not work.  It's never work.  You played a game.

|Now after all that effort, I will now have to put up with /ooc LVL46 Ranger
|LFG in Halls of Honor. Sheesh how fkin shitty is that. All that effort for
|the reward of gaining more zones to play in free from all the fkin morons
|who aren't in those zones simply because they are morons and now they open
|them all up to all and sundry.

	Sorry, but the lumpenproletariat are already in those zones, at least on
my server.
