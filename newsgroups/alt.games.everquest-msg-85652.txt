I apologize for the harshness of my post in response to "mugugaipan". 
Namecalling and profanity are pointless and counter-productive.  fwiw, I 
was not my usual self yesterday morning as some genius had backed his 
pickup into my car when I stopped for a cup of coffee on the way to 
work, costing me a couple hours and opening the prospect that I may end 
up out my 500$ insurance deductable (have not yet verified that he had 
insurance).
