I do think that it is easier to get to SB as a level 16-20 than it is to get
to LoIO, now, with Luclin (no boat, no spiders [OK, I am arachnophobic] and
no terror run through DL)  Also, the SK that wanders the newbie area in
Paineel is no longer KOS to everyone as he used to be.  I just don't
understand why I never see more than 5 or 6 people in the area.
