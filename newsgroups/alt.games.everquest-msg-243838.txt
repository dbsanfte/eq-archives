This is what I was curious about.  I have completed 45 LDoN, with 3 not
complete.  My adventurer's stone, combined with a charm and in my charm
slot, shows no bonus.  When I equip and unequip it, no stats change
whatsoever.

I am 51st level.  See that it say recommended level 65. Still, with 45 wins,
really thought I should be seeing some benefits.
