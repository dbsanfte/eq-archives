Just to add my comments, because that's the kind of gnome I am...

George R. R. Martin:
        Excelent.  Rather than the paper-thin archetypes (ultimate
good guy vs. ultimate evil guy) that most fantasy stories use, this
guy makes real characters with varying degrees of good guy/bad guy. 
Magic exists in the world but is sparse enough that the general
populace doesn't believe in it, and is actually surprised when they
see it in use.  And, he's not afraid to surprise you by killing off a
main character.  Write FASTER George!

Terry Prachett:
        Go to your local book store, buy one of each in stock.  You
can't go wrong.

Robert Jordan / Wheel of Time:
        First 2 or 3 were excelent, then started going downhill.  On
book 7 I got about 100 pages into it and cried uncle.  He had a good
trilogy that his publisher talked him into stretching out into an
anorexic cash cow who's teats are long dry and crusty.


Surprised that no one has mentioned David Eddings yet.  Start with the
Elenium and move on to the Belgariad if you like that.  He's a bit
guilty of the overpowered good guy who only has to find the bad guy
then blast him into tiny bits, but he still manages to make it
interesting.  T'was a sad day when I realized I had read everything
the guy had written.  Very interesting rulesets for magic and
immortality in his world.
