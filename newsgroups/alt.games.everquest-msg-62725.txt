Thanks for all the good advice.

: Are you a professional GAMING software developer?  They're a different

: get lock ups in either 98 or XP?

No, I'm not a games developer.  (It sounds interesting, but I hear the
pressure is pretty bad.)  I'm a systems developer.

I don't have 98 or XP installed, just W2K, so I'm not sure how they'd
work on my computer.  (I use W2K due to the demands and stresses I put
on my computer during work hours.)

I play plenty of other games on this PC without any problems.  I'm not
sure what EQ is doing different.  All my drivers are the latest and all
claim to be W2K compatible.  I'm up-to-date with all the latest Windows
updates.

Not sure what else to check.  Probably don't care after all this effort.
There are, after all, alternatives to EQ, even though I like EQ and will
hate to leave it.  But all this Alt+Tab nonsense and these lock-ups...
Bleh.  I'll live with an inferior MMORPG if I have to.  :(
