Yes tell us everything ;)

OK its grouping dungeons, what Id like to know is where are they, how do
you get tot hem and organise a group for the dungeon....thats the sort of
practicality useful to know for the guild Im in. Are there limited numbers
of dungeons? OK you hear no one can go into the Big Deep Hole Dungeon
while you are in there, but is that because they can run N instances of
BDH dungeon, or because they have a random dungeon generator or there are
simply 100 odd dungeons and they aint going to fill all of them.
