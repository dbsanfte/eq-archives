Well, for some reason this version of the FAQ isn't showing up in my
newsreader.  In fact, none of the messages from AGE are.  Hmmm. 

Thank you all who helped me put this thing together, both by writing
sections I've added, adding other content, or pointing out errors I've
made. 

Anyways, this thing is perfect and complete and I *dare* any of you
to find anything wrong with any of it!
