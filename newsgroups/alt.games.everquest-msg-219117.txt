Yep, missed that one.  Tops out at 25% at level 60.  Yeah, looked at the 
spells quickly, missed that the Vigor line was pet only, and was surprised 
at the time to see those.  Now I see why, and, yes, your healing sucks just 
as bad as the other hybrids with heal spells.

Hard to beat having the slow capability with decent healing as well as the 
ability to soak up damage reasonably well when the shaman gets aggro, which 
should not be often with an SK.
