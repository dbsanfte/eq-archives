Be careful with that.  For instance, my guild is quite active, having a set
raid schedule of three weeknights a week and often finding targets to hit
the other two as well as some weekend targets.  But if you were to just
browse past our webpage (http://www.reignofswords.com) we don't look to do
more than one raid every week or two.  What can I say, I'm the guy that does
the news posts and I'm lazy.  I post when it's new, funny, or I think it
would be interesting.  Which means you miss my sparkling 700th description
of a Vindi raid.  :P
