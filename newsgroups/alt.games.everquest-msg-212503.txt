I said nothing about assumptions about time.  You are making assumptions
about the Creator.

Once more, time does not apply to the Creator, it is part of the
creation.  This is annoyingly hard to talk about, since our
language is so totally immersed in time (for the obvious reason).

If to create is to know and to know is to create then your argument
goes poof.

You are writing about consequences, which require events to follow
one another in time.  If you take time out of the equation, then
acts and consequences are indistinguishable.  Knowledge and power
are indistinguishable.  God is not bound by the rules by which the
universe was created.

God does not know how we "will" decide, because that future tense
is a reference to time by which we are bound and God is not.
God knows how we decide.

To a timeless being there is no such thing as an ongoing process.

That is true, but I don't think you are quite grasping it's meaning.
If you were then I would not expect your arguments to revolve so
completely about time-based concepts.

For God there is no time of creation.  There is simply creation.

God is timeless.

Ah, there we go, a glimmer of understanding.  Please note, I am
not expecting you to accept my beliefs.  Rather I am attempting
to show how seeing God as truly timeless renders the whole
predestination vs. free will debate completely moot.

If God exists only within the context of time, then omnipotence +
omniscience precludes free will, for the reasons you've been
giving.  OTOH, if God is bound by time then God is not omnipotent
(oops, how inconvenient).

Ok, so back to our omnipotent God, now freed of the bounds of
time (remember that we are working with the idea of God as the
creator of the space-time continuum within which we exist).  If
God transcends time then all of our ideas involving time are
irrelevant to God's nature and it becomes impossible for us to
deduce an answer to the predestination vs. free will argument
(demonstrated for purposes of argument by considering the
possibility that there might be no distinction between creation
and knowledge of creation, not the assertion that this is true,
merely that the possibility of its truth defeats the argument
in favor of predestination).

So there you have it, put God into a particular box (time), and
you exchange the unimaginability of his omnipotence for the cold
comfort of predestination.  Many religious leaders, institutions,
and congregations seem to subscribe to one form or another of
"God-in-a-box" (actually, it looks to me like most do), and I
have little doubt that that is the root of much of the antipathy
towards religion expressed in this thread.  OTOH, many of us see
that the world is far more large and complex than we can truly
imagine, and we're working from the belief that God transcends
this unimaginably vast world created for us, which makes all
those boxes look pretty pointless.  So we take some comfort in
our rituals and our traditions, find strength in our common
purpose, and walk faithfully through the valley of the shadow of
death.
