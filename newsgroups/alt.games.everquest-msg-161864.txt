Posted on CastersRealm on November 7th:

Will players experience any side-effects in game as a result of using EQIM?
In particular will they have their rez timer on corpses consumerd by using
the EQIM program?

Being logged into EQ Instant Messenger does not count towards any
resurrection timers, corpse timers, and the like.  It connects you to the
chat server, but isn't connecting you to the game world in any way that
would affect your character at all.  Hope that helps clear things up,

- Rich
