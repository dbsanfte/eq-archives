Emulators have always been shit because you are placing another
program between your current program and the current op sys. It tends
to slow things down. I guess if you have to do it.. like most Mac
enthusiasts agreed they couldn't live with out.. an emulator is grand.
But from what i saw.. it never truly got popular until it was lashed
to a PC on an add-in daughterboard.

Oh... my bad.

And FWIW... Windows XP is on one CDROM, cept it has to be installed
:>. You have the name for that linux distro offhand?

Yup. But it sure was fun! :> Man... nothing was cooler than making
port and interrupt calls in Assembly Language. It made ya feel a
little like god O:>.

Yup.. remember those.

DOS never was.. UNIX has taken the command-line about as far as it can
go. You can feel like an artist tying UNIX command-lines. Not to
mention the finished command-lines start to look like art too :>.
