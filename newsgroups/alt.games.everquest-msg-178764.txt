Maybe with modern stuff, but long bows have more range and power than
crossbows could ever hope to have.  The English Longbowsmen werent feared
for nothing.  And accuracy? Hmm when you have 10,000 men shooting 100,000
arrows a minute, who can say who is more accurate :P

I would say an expert bowsman and an expert crossbowman will have similar
accuracy, a person who has just picked up a bow for the first time will
probably be more accurate with a Cross-bow.
