I was feeling fairly sympathetic towards this guy until I read the
section where he says since his password is hard to remember, he keeps
it pasted to the front of his computer.

At this point, my sysadmin instincts kick in and the rest of the story
is just so much fluff.

Now this is a peeve of mine and has nothing to do with EQ, but WHY...
I mean really WHY do people think that the front of their computer is
a safe place to keep their password?

No one but them EVER looks at their computer?

Oh well...
