Raptors are totally awesome, you just need to practice it more.
Once you have the 7 or 8 spawn broken, its easy.
You just need to know where they spawn exactly, and try and pick up the 2
wanderers in the first quad.
I never have to bail from raptors nowadays, and dont even bother with levi
after the spawn is broken. (cant use soe+form of the howler)

Ive done a bit of quadding in skyfire, but the problem I have there is that
the monsters are a bit large. My dd is often not hitting all 4. The sperm
work real well tho. I havnt tried 4 wyverns in sskyfire yet, but i imagine
they would work well too, since they are so popular in CS (never quadded
them myself).

You can pick up a quad in bw too, but its a lot of messing around trying to
find 4 dark blues.
