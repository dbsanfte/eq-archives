Hmm, I was in Salt Lake City a few months back... Didn't see any of that.

}I'm thinking more about derivation of power.  No subordinate can have more

}derive their power from the school boards, who derive their power from the

}rights similar to the U.S. Constitution.  Even if it were not so, the
}"seperation of church and state" is based on the First Ammendment of the
}U.S. Constitution, so that's where I'm going to show that it doesn't apply
}to this case.

I agree that that's how it should be.  I could see the Supreme Court going 
either way on it, though.
