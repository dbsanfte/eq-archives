Your truck example is good in the examples where it applies, and it
DOES apply to many cases. 

But the reality of the tribute system contained numerous examples
where people were selling bags of earthworms for millions of dollars.
Obviously that isn't right. 

I solidly agree with sony's actions, just not to the degree. I think
they should have left considerable more value on Velium and
Finsteell.. a couple dozen points instead of half a dozen. Nowhere
near the hundreds they used to be, but still worthwhile...
