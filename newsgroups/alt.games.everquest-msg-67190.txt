Oh, I forgot, you can also get an imbued idol for your range slot made by a 
potter using some expensive ingredients made by enchanters and rogues...

The Karana one is WIS 3, sv magic 2

You can also get imbued field plate made by a human smith, but since you 
were asking about tailored armour I'm guessing you are a druid and can only 
wear leather.
