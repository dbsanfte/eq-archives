The only place I think there is any kind of animal faction is in Qeynos
Hills, and I am not even sure it is connected to anything relevant. I'd
not worry about it much.

Unfortunatly, I think this is a bad thing, I think there should be an
animal faction which is connected to NPC druid and ranger factions, bugs
me to see druids and rangers killing amiable bears and wolves.

My personal rule of thumb is, if I con it and it is amiable, I don't
attack it. If I con an animal and it is threatening, it should be
culled. So far I have not met a cat in Norrath that did not need to be
culled.
