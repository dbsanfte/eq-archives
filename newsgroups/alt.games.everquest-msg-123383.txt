I would agree. I too would have appreciated more of a stance one

So, you are justified in any action according to your powers of
persuasion and debate? If you can convince me, then you are in the
right? Therefore, those lacking a knack for proselytization will
always be more wrong? What a load of crap.

As a race we normally determing right and wrong according to our
religious beliefs. Show me a religion that views all matters as a gray
area and I'll show you a toy religion.
