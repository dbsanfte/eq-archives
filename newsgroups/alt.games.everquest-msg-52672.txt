    That's not what my friend the bard told me. He said that if you get a
res before /release, you lose no XP. The only problem is getting that res,
since you can't beg folks for one while hovering around. However, given that
res comes at level 10 and players are already using "res runner" techniques
to ensure the party gets ressed, and add in the low downtime for the resser
to res everyone, and I think you'll see more resses in DAoC than in EQ. But
that's a guess.

    This is where DAoC puts the sting in - the unressed death is a pain. But
compare with EQ. In EQ, you MUST go back to where you died if you want your
stuff back. In DAoC, returning to the gravestone is an option. In EQ, an
unressed death is (your figure) 12% XP loss, versus 10% (and no losing
level) and a cash payment in DAoC. And finding a resser to group with is
much easier in DAoC, as the level at which res becomes available is lower.

    This is good. DAoC is tougher than EQ, but much more fair. As long as
bind points are placed intelligently, DAoC has the upper hand here.
