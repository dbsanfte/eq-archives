If I had been there they might not have seen me but I bet they would have
smelled me.  I'd have had to make a run to the bank for a change of armor.

First time I saw a gnoll reaver on a run thru ek, I freaked. I was invis and
I heard the "half-elves like you".  See the reaver, ahhhhhhhhhh! What do I
do?  Ahhhhhh! Accidentaly right clicked, he was blue to me and had no SoW.
If he had been red, time for a new pair of patchwork leggings.
