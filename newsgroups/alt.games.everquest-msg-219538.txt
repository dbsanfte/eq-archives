Well there is inertia. :)

Seriously - both games need a fair amount of time input to enjoy to their
fullest so the inertia in this case is not wanting to dilute both games by
playing both. Depends on how much time you have on your hands - I keep
myself limited to two pay for games EQ and World War II Online. WWIIOnline
I can hop into at any time due to its semi persistence and more FPS action
type. I think Id not be able to sustain 2 MMORPGs at once myself. THat is
an issue irrespective of the games.

I did try UO a while ago. I found 3 problems, well 3 aspects of the game
that meant it didnt suit me. It took quite a long time online to start to
achieve things - once you got there it started rolling but there was a
significant lead time that doesnt really exist in EQ if you are prepared
to solo a bit while you wait to do something or to tradeskill. Second, the
PKers were a PAIN in the ass. It was generally griefer types as well. They
really weren't achieiving anything beyond pissing people off. The
isometric view really didnt fit well with me for a game of this type
(strange considering I liked it in the single player version I know).

All these put me off it. Now it wouldnt surprise me if any of these have
changed - and some of them won't be an issue for other people (they may
have other issues). I did like the customisable characters, I did like the
ideas behind the economy though I thought it was a little to vulnerable to
abuse, I did like the scope of the game. EQ just suited me better.
