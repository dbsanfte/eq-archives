Oh, really now.


Tried this today, matter of fact.  Went out to Dreads, searched around
for a couple Ragers.. what few were still around and not being pulled
from Nwall groups.

The findings?  After two casts of 1110 Ice comet and a 600 or so
Conflagration, the Rager was still standing, needing a quicky shot of
Shock of Frost (180 or so)  to finally put down.

End result, after root and Bonds of Force... Three bubbles of mana
spent.  This is with a maxed out intel of 200.  Actually, a bit over,
matter of fact.  Same as every other blue kill I've encountered so
far.

Certianly not enough to make me stray from Colbalt Scar hunting.  And
they are certianly not able to be killed in two nukes.  And if my
group was hunting these things at my level, I'd port the group over to
Track's in order to do some actual worthwhile and challenging hunting.
