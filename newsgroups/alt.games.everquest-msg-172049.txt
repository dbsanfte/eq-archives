It's silly to expect NBG. But there is nothing silly about NBG. If you keep
expecting it you'll keep being disappointed. It makes the game alot more
enjoyable but at the same time NBG is more often used by certain people to
get an item they want all the while they know if they were somewhere else
when someone elses item dropped they wouldn't say a thing about NBG.
For example I had a group before in kanors and we were a NBG group, we had
two camps to choose from. One camp had a monk drop while the other camp had
nothing for a monk. The group decided to take the camp where nothing dropped
for the monk. This monk who five minutes ago was NBG all the way suddenly
didn't want to be in our group anymore.
NBG is great but unfortunately too many people try to use it to their
advantage.
The only thing you can expect is GREED.
