I'm not rushing to defend them, but there is a "point of diminishing
returns" when it comes to programming.  For example, say it takes 1
programmer 40 man hours to do project X, it'll likely take 2 about 20 hours.
But you put 10 on it and most likely it will take much longer then 4 total.
Likely they are at the point where adding extra hands would just have people
in the way.  If they can only break the project into X distinct parts, then
having more then X programmers results in wasted resources.  Better to use
them to full potential on a different project.

Yeah, it does seem that they are tying up loose ends.  I could see them once
EQ2 is a reality start combining servers and then just "letting it go"  No
GM's, No rules, just a player world.
