Bards are usually number one on my list of suspects when trying to
figure out how an NPC gets accidentally aggro'd. They just have so many
damned songs they are playing all the time, and so many of them are AoE.

If there were no songs playing, then my next best guess is that the mage
was KOS and the gypsy interpreted his binding you as a "buff" (helping
you) thereby putting you on the hate list.
