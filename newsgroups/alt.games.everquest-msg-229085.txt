HHK is great if you can get in. The POK book via Rivervale isn't that far
to run. Also, it's almost all pickup groups since the place is nearly
permacamped.

The Overthere is right off POK, and almost always has something going on
for a pickup group.


SK aviaks are good thru 30, gnolls are good thru 35 if you push it. Can
often find a duoing partner here. Splitpaw is nearby as well, will take
you thru 35 easily, but is pretty much BYOG.

SolA is great xp and loot, but is BYOG.

Lizard Island in Feerrott is great. Doable with group or solo, if you were
of a class that could actually solo. BYOG of course.

Crystal Caverns is pretty good, but BYOG. Snare/CC is a requirement.


That's about it for where I usually hang out at those levels...
