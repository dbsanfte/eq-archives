	Hello people,
Can anybody tell me what steps i have to take for my EQ characters
when i get my new comp next week. My question is :Are there files or
something that i need to put on the new computer after i install
everquest again? I'm not changing servers or anything.  But i would
hate to see them all naked and broke if you know what i mean. ;)
Any help would be appriciated.

thanks
Tim
