We will have to agree to disagree.  If he knows everything, then he knows 
what choices we will make, he has always known, and he will always know. 
A creator cannot both create us with free will, and at the same time know 
every single choice we will make based on how he chose to create us.  The 
best he can do is create us with the illusion of free will.  Of course, 
the same argument can be made for the universe without a creator.

I am not saying that omniscience and omnipotence are mutually exclusive 
by any means, I am saying that if we have a creator who does indeed have 
both of those qualities, then, we do not have free will.
