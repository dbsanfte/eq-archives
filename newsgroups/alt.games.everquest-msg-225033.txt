You misunderstand what I'm saying.  Its certainly more efficient than 
any other heal in your arsenal.  However, its Less efficient than a heal 
at 25%, until such a point as your target has 12000 hp (where the Cheal 
will heal for 8000 hp at 25% or lower.

If your target has 3000 hp and your CHeal lands at 50%, its getting 1500 
hp worth of healing done.  But if it lands at 25%, its getting 2250 hp 
of healing done for the same mana.  Thats clearly more efficient.  This 
logic continues right down to 1% hp remaining... if you ignore the fact 
that when the HP totals get low, chunky damage can mean dead tank, much 
more expensive in terms of mana cost than healing a little sooner.

Your analysis is correct, just doesn't address the issue I was talking 
about.
