The offer can't hurt.  My wizard friend *always* has his evac spell up in LDONs
in case of a horrible overpull.  And he's used it a few times.  And no one has
complained :)))
Druids at lower levels are usually in charge of *some* buffs, snare, damage
shield for the main tank and nukes as mana is available - along with backup
healing should it be necessary -   
We always discuss *who's going to do what?* before we enter the dungeon and if
no one brings it up then *you* should.  That way someone else isn't overriding
your spell or wasting mana needlessly.  I'd just ask: "anyone want druid buffs?
 I'll snare unless someone else has a better one?  Mr. Tank do you want me to
keep my DS on you?"  (And mention that you have your evac spell up).
Once you have real port spells someone will probably *ask* you to cast it when
the mission is over.  If not you can remind them you have it.  
I love LDON myself....
