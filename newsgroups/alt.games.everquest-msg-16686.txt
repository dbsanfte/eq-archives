For anyone just joining our program, this is an *EXCELLENT* example of
why you should never give out your account information to anybody. Even
Verant reps will NEVER ask for it, as they have it already. I feel bad
for the poster, but I'm sorry, pal. That was really naive and you are
paying the price. Best advice.... go buy a new set of software, start
over, and don't do that again.
