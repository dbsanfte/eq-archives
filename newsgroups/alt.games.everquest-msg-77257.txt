I did 27 - 29 all over.

Spitpaw entrance is good, if you can find a spire. It is always so
camped.
Avaiaks are "OK" if you cant get a spire.

Stonebrunt is ok xp, but risky and poor loot. you can also do most of
the names in the warrens for kicks. Leave Mugglewump alone! he will kick
your arse.

Loio - I camped both the goblin back and front entrances (Back is much
easier) and the back entrance to the Sarnark (SP) fort. Great xp but
again loot is poor.

WW - The giant fort is becoming trivial, but the loot is good. (You do
know the safe spot out the back don't you ?)

FM - I am strictly solo with my druid so I stayed out of here till I hit
29. Even then it is a bit of a pain. I pull back to the loio zone, but
resists are high. I have been hunting brutes there for my halfling
armour. In a group go to the fort and make PP off of the giants. 

BB - Goblins as in other post.

I think that that covers it.

Oops one more Rathe mnt. killing the Giant skellies. Easy, but not great
xp or pp. If you dont insist on soloing you can always pick up a giant
group. Just watch out for the Ogres.

I'm bound at the Loio/FM zone line. With ports I can hunt anywhere I
like. The joy of druids !
