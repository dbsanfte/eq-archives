Um... I never said it was a hobby rather than necessity. In fact, it is
necessity for me. But thanks for assuming.

And yes, it does sidestep the point that it is "neither in character nor
particularly
entertaining to have a main character in an action/adventure story spend a
significant amount of time crafting mundane items." But you're the one that
asked when the last time was someone had done one of those things. Besides, I
don't recall anyone saying you are required to take up trade skills in a game,
just that they were an option.
