We changed over to Chivalry and Sorcery when it came out (Dear God!  That
was almost 30 years ago!) and also Runequest to avoid the limit on spell
memorizations.  Also, we really disliked level based P&P games (so Runequest
was almost Heaven for us).  There was actually bookkeeping for casters with
these systems in action, more in downtime.  In general, though, they both
made more sense as systems.

Of course, C&S was a real pain to play as a caster as you had to spend so
much game time learning.  No one wanted to be a 60 year old Mage just
starting to adventure with all the kids with swords.  And if the caster was
to learn more once they started adventuring, they had to have a lot of
downtime between adventures compared to the melee types.
