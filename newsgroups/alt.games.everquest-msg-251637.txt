i like to classify this as a raid-ish spell...it's the inverse of CotH, if
you like to be imaginative =p

if you get the spell, and you should eventually (no rush), you should
probably nab a few of the reagents...dont be ashamed to ask to be
reimbursed, they go for ~300p, when you hand them out ... smart people carry
their own, but if you want to be superboyscoutmage, carry a few for the kind
souls that need a favor =)

at 65 you get an elemental charm -- CotAM usually goes for quite a hefty
chunk of change, but when you get that, you need this

you will also use this as a support mez for an enchanter/another mage if
he's charming elementals

i strongly recommend getting this,even though it's not every day you play
support-mez...this sounds like the only spell you're missing that you should
really have

useful, but you're right - you wont notice too much of a difference
