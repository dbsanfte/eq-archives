Trouble is, if the tanks were bright enough, the critter would rarely get
against the wall to begin with.

What's the deal with tanks not getting into their heads the idea that you
don't have to be IN FRONT of a critter to hit it?  And in fact, it DOES
require a few IQ points to be a tank...you gotta be smart enough to, dunno,
change locations?  To surround a critter?  To NOT knock it off a bridge, a
cliff, up a tree, get it stuck in a wall, etc?

Ah, case in point, Black Reavers.  Totally magic resistant, so the only
thing my enchanter can do is melee during the actual fight (usually has
plenty of mana...does a whopping 75hp of damage per fight with my epic <g> )
just so I don't get bored...that's when we have SMART tanks.

When we have stupid tanks, I have to chain-tash the reaver to get it mad
enough at me to run to me away from the wall or water.  I've yet to die but
I've had good healers WASTING mana on an enchanter doing a freakin' tank's
job.

Anyway, just grumpy today.
