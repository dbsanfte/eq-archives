make a new macro. on the right hand bottom menu click on Socials then use
the right arrow until u find a clear button. Right click on it and it'll
open up as about 8 blank lines. Enter your message on these lines. Also
theres a short line at the top to name the macro such as 'auction' etc . U
can select the text color to by clicking on the 'A' by text color. When ur
all done click ok. Now, left click and hold on the macro button and it will
stick to the cursor. Carry it over to the left hand side of the screen and
drop it in an emty menu square so its easy to use on the future.

Tip: Theres a lot of lag with EQ. I've found its useful to do this on a
macro button:

/auction WTS Goulbane || Black Pearl || Sarnak Emblazoned Tabard
/pause 4
/auction Dwaven Work boots || Sarnak great Cleaver

The effect of pause 4 is to delay posting of the next line by 4, this helps
with lag as it u run it all out in one go lag often loses all after the
first line. I've found this helps people on slow connectiosn who told me
they thought they were missing parts of my auctions (i.e. a sentence didnt
make sense as it stopped half way when I had gone onto a new line).

One last thing, if u come to alter ur macro, right click again but be aware,
clicking on any of the lines of text will make them delete, so make sure u
know what was there so u can rewrite it
