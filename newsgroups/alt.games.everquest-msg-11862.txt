There are very few people who can out-taunt my shaman, should I want the
aggro. And they generally have to work at it.

Compare an SK in a group with no shaman vs a shaman tanking, and the shaman
will do better. The shaman (if smart) will have comparable ac to the SK,
but the SK is taking 60+% more damage.

I started soloing frogs in sebilis at 53. A L60 SK with epic and full kael
armor *might* be able to duplicate it for one frog...I keep up with
multiple spawns.

All that being said, he never advocated taking a shaman as your primary
tank over a warrior/sk/pally/ranger/monk. Just that shamans have the tools
and ability to tank, far better than any rogue, bard, cleric, druid,
wizard, enchanter, necromancer, or magician will.

However, in this case he is right. Celt is a blithering idiot.

One of my more favorite things to do with my shaman is to duo up with a
monk and take a room in karnors. Couldn't do that with a warrior.

Against epic mobs (Cazic-Thule v2.0, Yelinak, Dain, Sontalak, Kael
Vindicators, etc) yes, a defensive capable warrior is clear and above your
best option. But that is a lot of game where a monk does as well, or
better.

I've never heard of an SK or Pally having better ac than a monk unless they
VASTLY outclassed him equipment wise (Like, full Kael armor for the SK/Pal,
vs shivercrap on the monk).

Warriors can beat monks with greater ease...but since a lot of monk stuff
is easier to get, monks generally beat them until the very endgame.
