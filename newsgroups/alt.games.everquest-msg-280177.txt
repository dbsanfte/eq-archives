Well, I got back in tonite.  First thing I heard when I got in to PoK
was people yelling for KEI.  Guess some things never change.  I had
assumed that there would be so many high level chanters that everyone
would just pretty much have it permanently.  Or else sony would have
put in KEI stones.

One other thing I noticed... my Dark Elf chanter's faction with just
about everyone seems to have dropped significantly.  I don't recall my
faction with each group but for example, in Shadow Haven, I had
vendors telling me that they didn't deal with DEs.  As I recall it
used to be that everyone started with neutral faction there, and I'm
sure I didn't do anything to screw up my faction.  If anything I ran a
few quests to jack it up.  Did they change the SH faction?  Or am I
completely mis-remembering?
