Real Life Story follows:

In the RAAF each base had a WOD (Warrant Officer Disciplinarian) whose job
it was to go around and be a general ass: ie, your shoes aren't shiney
enough, stand straighter and any issues regarding drill and general
discipline.

Their badge of Office was a Pace Stick (which was basically a 4 foot long
wooden caliper which when unfolded was the official measure of "a pace").

My best friend  in the Air Force was the only person in our flight who was a
bigger drinker, bluer and  smart ass than myself. We were still under trade
training and walking to the mess for lunch when we got stopped by the WOD
for walking accross the grass. Tsk Tsk...

The WOD decided to start his dressing down on Ben unfortunately for us (and
him)...

*WOD pokes his Pace Stick at Ben's Chest*
WOD: "There's a piece of shit on the end of this stick LAC"
*without a heartbeats delay*
Ben: "Not at this end, SIR!"
*long pause*
...
...
It was easily worth the six weeks guard duty we both got watching the
realisation slowly dawn on his face at what had just happened. It was the
only time I had ever seen a WOD lost for words.
