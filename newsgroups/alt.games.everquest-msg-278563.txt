You are firstly confusing laid back with low skill.  I run a split
90/10 or 10/90 because
1.  I like to see both bars move... it's selfish and I know it may be
less efficient
2.  I'm in no hurry to see 70.. it will come.. IF on the other hand I
really want that next aa or spell I'll switch off.  Occasionally I'll
run 50/50 if xp is flowing really good.  but that is rare.
3.  low risk... I think not... I eat 3-5 unressed deaths per week due
to laziness, impatience, cheapness or stubbornness... I've solo'd in
Tactics, Storms, Nightmare, Draniks and various non-instanced DoN
zones... I have solo'd xp granting summoners as recently as level 60. I
may soon try soloing in NC or some of the other Omens or GoD zones.
OTOH I have spent 3-5 days without getting xp or killing anything
because I'm mashing buttons on a tradeskill or roaming the earth to see
what I can see.

I am laid back, I am also skilled and effective.  Laid back means I'm
not driven to do things the High speed uber way... it does not mean I'm
weak, lazy or stupid.
