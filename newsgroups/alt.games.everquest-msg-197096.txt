as a 49 mage i struggle between the water pet and fire pet.... but how much
do the nukes they cast really help?  with the assistance of a friend we
determined that the fire pet has around 2k - 2.5k hp @ level 49.  It being
the weakest the others scale up.  Fire pet has a nasty regen, same for
water, air is not so bad and earth sucks... earth also has best Hp and roots
every 8 seconds.  Air stuns every 8 seconds... SO what about the nukes? what
are they and how much damage do they really do? anyone know???
