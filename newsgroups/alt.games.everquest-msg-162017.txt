I have never heard this particular idea stated, but its vaguely possible.

I can say, however, that one reason you need the other classes is that you will
require different parts for your quest, each of which can ONLY be made by a Vah
Shir of one class who has reached this same stage of the quest.

Similarly, anyone of those other classes who wants to complete this stage of
their quest will need your help for one of the components they require.

I have yet to meet anyone who has actually managed to do this quest.

Llyric, 41 Vah Shir Bard... got to this stage and gave up, Morell Thule
