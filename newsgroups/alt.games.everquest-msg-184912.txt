I think what y'all are missing is just a difference in basic philosophy.
The root question is "Why play the game?"  For some, it is purely the
challenge of winning, and the actual mechanics of doing so are irrelevant.
For a few, that even includes true rule violations, but for others, it's
just taking advantage of the holes in "fantasy".  For others, the reason for
playing is the game experience.  It is, after all, a fantasy.  One can be
perfectly satisfied playing the game and never go higher than say level 30,
as long as you play within the scope of the fantasy.  For others, it doesn't
matter how you get there, getting to ever higher levels equates to winning.
But twinking out your newbie character to the max and then using a level 50
druid to make the newbie nearly invincible for power levelleling is not
"natural" in the scope of the fantasy.  No, it doesn't break any rules (that
I know of), but it is certainly not my cup of tea.  Fortunately, the EQ
world is large enough that I can play my way and others can power level to
their hearts content.

Cheers,
Eric
