I just got disconnected from EQ and am now patching a file called tln.eqg.
Anyone else just have that weirdness happen to them?  I had three computers
get kicked off at once, and all are now patching.. so either my network
connection dropped and this is just a file they put up since this morning,
or they booted lots of people so they could download these files.  Just
wondering if anyone else had a weird experience.
