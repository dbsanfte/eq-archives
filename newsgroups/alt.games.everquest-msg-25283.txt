There is no Mithril Cloak that drops in SolB that I know of.
It was probably this item:

Polished Mithril Torque  +7 AC +13 Wis +13 Int   Nagafens Lair  50

Which is a neck item not a back item. Decent AC 7 for a tank
in that slot. However, you are correct in the sense that it definitely
should have gone to a Hybrid class, ranger being the best choice since
they are a chain class, all the other hybrids can get plate items.
WTF does a warrior need int and wisdom for beside learning trade
skills? If I was a warrior I'd wear a fine plate collar(AC 8) over this
any day. For a warrior AC is king. Hell I'd even wear an Ulthork Hide
Collar  +7 AC +30 Hit Points -30 Mana over that Torque for a warrior,
and it drops in a hell of a lot easier place.
