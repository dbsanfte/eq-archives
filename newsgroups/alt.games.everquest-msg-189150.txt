While I agree with the sentiment, it may be just a bit harsh.  Has no one
ever gotten your goat to the point that you just had to say something?  I
know I've done really well lately, but sometimes I just can't let let stuff
go by.

Mandatory EQ Content:  Dinged 14 last night.  Can't sell a spider silk at
5pp to save my life, but at least the Bazaar crash monster seems to be
sleeping.  I actually woke up to my 118 spider silks still for sale.
Hopefully, they will sell today, while I'm at work.

Cheers,
Eric
