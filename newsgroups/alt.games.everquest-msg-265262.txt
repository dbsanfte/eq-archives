Based on Clinton's Intel?  The guy was out of office for what, two 
years, when we went to war in Iraq.  Based on Bush's intel.  Based on UN 
Intel.  Based on Tony Blair's Intel.  Basing your decisions on intel 
thats several years out of date doesn't really show anything positive 
about your jumping to conclusions problem.

If you want to say "based on Clinton's Intel" you might as well say 
"based on George Bush the first's Intel", which was similarly out of 
date... but which at the time created a decision NOT to go... one that 
in retrospect looks like sheer genius, everything they feared would 
happen if we -did- go, has happened.  Maybe Boy George should have asked 
Daddy what he thought of the idea; the man was head of the CIA and 
continues to get briefed with all the secrets that most americans won't 
have access to for the next 50 years.

Further, Bush's people were coming up with intel contradicting the 
WMD's, its just that those reports were being ignored or better, 
deliberately buried.  Because Bush wanted to hit Iraq long before 9/11, 
and was merely looking for excuses; thats why every time one "reason" is 
found to be false, he just throws up a different reason and claims that 
this is the real one, even though we have videotape of the guy and his 
advisors all saying the opposite.

Hmm.  No.  BUT thats not at all what's being proposed.

Perhaps you aren't aware of where those embryoes come from.

Many people are unable to concieve naturally, and the widely accepted 
practice of in vitro conception has been developed to give them a chance 
of creating a child with their own egg and sperm.  But in vitro has an 
enormous failure rate.  First, its difficult to mate the eggs with sperm 
successfully, second, its difficult to get an embryo to implant in the 
womb... particularly when you consider that we're talking couples who 
were having extreme difficulty in the first place.

SO what we do is we attempt fertilization on a dozen at once.  Then we 
try and implant half a dozen at a time.  Several fail to concieve, 
several fail to implant, but hopefully with this shotgun approach we get 
one that does.

We keep the rest on ice, literally, because the pregnancy may fail 
somewhere along the way, again, we're talking women with balky wombs, 
besides which even "normal" women spontaneously abort a LOT, I've seen 
estimates that the average woman does so about 5 times in her life, 
noting nothing more than an unusually heavy period if she hasn't 
happened to take a pregnancy test during the few days when she was gravid.

Eventually, though, with a success, the remaining embryo's now become 
surplus.  You might not like this fact, but it is currently the case; 
those embryos would require a willing womb, and thousands of dollars in 
operations in order to try for a pregnancy with them.  Volunteers for 
this are scarce; if you can get pregnant normally, its free to do so, 
and its your own eggs you are bearing.  If you can't, and can't make 
your own embryos, then it seems cheaper and simpler to adopt.

Like it or not, those surplus embryos get discarded.  Destroyed.  If you 
assume they are fully human, murdered.  The only way to stop it is to 
stop in vitro ensemination.

As I pointed out above, this is irrelevant to the question; you're point 
would be interesting in a discussion of abortion or of in vitro 
fertilization... but its a footnote in one about whether its OK to do 
something with the embryos which are going to be discarded anyway.

> starts life at conception.
> 
Thats your call.  And its an interesting one.  But you aren't fighting 
the right fight here, embryonic stem sell research is a tiny sideline 
compared to abortion (which has never been related to the stem cell 
research) and to in vitro fertilization, which I've seen precisely 
nobody arguing against in the past 20 years despite the fact that it 
means tens of thousands of embryos are being created and then destroyed.

AND since Bush approved of around 60 lines, he lost any claim to moral 
absolutes regarding this issue; he's OK with the idea as long as you use 
only lines that were already created in just this way... his stance is 
just that its sort of wrong so we shouldn't do it any more.

Its possible that you disagree with him... but hey, if so, then he's 
just as wrong.  Would it be OK to use lampshades made with human flesh 
as long as you insure that no future humans will be killed for making 
more lampshades?  If its wrong, its wrong.

It turns out that the 60 lines were mostly not useable, only about 19 
lines work, and that those 19 lines overlap sufficiently that they 
aren't really enough to do the research with.  It might have been OK to 
go with the Bush compromise, when it looked like we had 60 lines we 
could use.  But that would be leaping to a conclusion and being, in the 
end, wrong, which is, after all, what I'm complaining about.  I just 
said it in 27 words instead of the 600+ it just took to explain more fully.

It had already vanished before 9/11, the economy tanked ever since 
around november 2000, shortly after the republicans started saying we 
were entering a recession.  Any realistic assesment of the budget would 
have shown that no massive surplus was going to be forthcoming.  It 
doesn't matter if you blame that on republican doomsaying or if you say 
that it was the inevitable result of Clinton policies... the fact is it 
didn't take a whole lot of vision to see it happening, but the first 
round of tax cuts was predicated on it not happening.

And it doesn't matter why, for this particular arguement, since all I'm 
saying is, the big givaway was predicated on a surplus which hadn't 
happened yet, the fact that it never did happen for Whatever reason only 
helps prove this.  Even if it had happened, it would have still been 
just as much a Jumping to Conclusion.

I don't think you will be able to find a single democrat who acts in any 
way as though 9/11 never happened.  Bush, on the other hand, acted that 
way for seven long lingering minutes... and hardly any better for 
another 17+ hours, till finally kicking in following the lead of the 
amazing Rudy Giuliani (who I'd -never- have suspected of having such 
heroic good sense).  And since most of the Bush initiatives which are 
proposed as 9/11 related were in fact already on the "we want to do 
this" shelf before 2001, it wouldn't be farfetched to say that he's not 
responding to 9/11 either, other than as an opportunity to push thru 
stuff he'd never have been able to sell otherwise.  That would be going 
too far, I'm sure he has stuff on the shelf he put aside after 9/11, and 
I'm sure he's trying to pick stuff from the shelf that -is- relevant. 
But I'm just saying, if you want to trade cheap shots, he's handed out 
plenty of ammunition.

Yep, Reagan, you nailed it.  8 years of misery.  Clinton, 8 years of 
prosperity.  But in your eyes, the 8 years of misery were legacy from 
Carter, and the 8 years of prosperity were legacy from Reagan... despite 
an intervening 4 years of Bush, who as it happens wasn't practicing the 
Voodoo Economics that Reagan tried and proved useless... but Bush II 
went ahead and tried again.

Personally, I think the reason for this is that Reagan, a decent man, 
was by the time of his presidency addled by alzheimers and by and large 
the puppet of a power movers and shakers... the same guys that put 
Cheyney in charge with Bush as a puppet.   Seems to make sense, because 
the policies of both heavily benefit those groups, and make little 
logical sense considered any other way.

How do you know it "kept America afloat"?  Isn't it just as likely, on 
the face of it, that it "caused the troubles we are having"?

But again, it doesn't matter, for this argument, which you believe.  My 
point is that EITHER it makes sense when you have a surplus, OR it makes 
sense when you have a deficit... to use the same exact approach to both 
situations tells me that your approach isn't tailored to the situation 
at all, rather, its simply what you want to do, and you are looking for 
any excuse to do so.  I'm being disengenous when I say that in this case 
the candidate was jumping to a conclusion, honestly I'd have to say I 
believe he's merely Claiming to be jumping to a conclusion, in reality 
he's lying about the reasoning entirely.

But I hate to accuse a sitting president of lying, so I'm pretending to 
believe him about his reasoning, in which case its a perfect example for 
my point.

Hmm, and why would I believe those Iraqis?  I imagine if you talked to 
the Vietnamese people they too would have said they were all in favor of 
the americans and loved everything we were doing... while in many cases 
saying the exact opposite to the Viet Cong.  Some were lying to us, some 
to them, some to both... but in all cases, they were lying for the same 
reason, because you don't tell the guy pointing a gun at your head that 
you disagree with him.  (I don't know that you had a gun with you, but 
America itself is a big gun, and I wouldn't necessarily put too much 
credence in what anyone tells you as a member of the coalition... OR as 
a member of any antiamerican group.)

In the end, though, I don't think you can say that we didn't need the 
troops that we were told we'd need and Bush decided not to bring.  I 
don't care if it is just ten guys in a room, or if its 100,000 foreign 
infiltrators, or anything in between, the simple fact is it -isn't- 
going cleanly, and we've never been in control of the situation, and it 
all came as a big suprise to the President (unless you believe he was 
lying and knew full well it would be an outlandish mess... but even I 
can't come up with a decent reason to believe that)

So why weren't the funds for the war in the budget?  As far as I know 
they -still- aren't there, although by now we're fully aware that we 
aren't going to get anyone else to pay for the bloody thing.

Good point, its almost unfair to call him on this one, I only do so 
because A) he tried to deny it for a long time after the fact, until 
someone produced the actual document in question and pictures of him 
with it in his hands.  And B) I'm only making the point that he leapt to 
a conclusion... whether its one everyone else would have leapt to as 
well has no bearing.

If it helps, Tom Clancy, an author with a very large leadership, had 
also written a novel where an aircraft laden with fuel is used as an 
instrument of terror, striking the Capital Building.  While I was 
horrified by the events as they unfolded, I wasn't entirely suprised, 
the idea was already out there at -least- as far back as 1996.

Bush is the candidate of Osama Bin Laden.  OBL thinks he can manipulate 
the american people by simple reverse psychology, and he may be proved 
correct.

But the whole point is moot, because it doesn't matter to me -who- OBL 
would like to have in office.  Question is, who's the best man for the 
job, Not who does some crazed terror master think is in his best interest.

You might be right.  I hope not, but the Kerry candidacy has always been 
a long shot at best.  Someone earlier in the thread objected to my 
characterizing the Spanish election as having something to do with a 
response to a terrorist attack; they said that in Europe they've been 
living with terrorism long enough to know better than to do anything on 
a political level in reaction to what they think the terrorists want... 
the election, instead, hinged on the then government's reaction to the 
event, which was to deliberately try and mischaracterize it as a Basque 
attack.

Are Americans sophisticated enough, experienced enough at this dirty 
game, to see past the facile spinning of Bush... or of Kerry for that 
matter, and not worry about what they think Osama wants or doesn't want? 
  We're new at this game, and the desperate spinning from every side 
isn't really helping us figure out how best to react.  If, in retrospect 
looking back from 10 years in the future, we decide this whole election 
boiled down to that one video... well, what does that say about how 
powerful we've let one crazy man living in a cave become?

I don't know who Osama wants to win, personally I'd think he'd be better 
off with Bush in office, but I'm sure you think the same thing about 
Kerry.  I just don't think that I want his opinion to make up my mind 
for me.  IMO, Kerry has a good shot at making an acceptable (though 
admittedly not likely great) president, while Bush II has already 
demonstrated an astonishingly poor ability to be president, doing a 
crappy job of almost everything I'd like a president to be.

You have to take under advisement, though, that I think Clinton was a 
great president, that Bush I was a decent president, that Reagan sucked 
as a president, and that (this will really make your skin crawl) Carter 
was also an acceptable president... and that he'd still be my pick if I 
could choose any politician alive to be president now (I think he'd make 
a much better one now than he did in the 70s)
