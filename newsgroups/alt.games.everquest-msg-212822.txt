Yes it is (in most cases, I believe there are some cases where Warrior
disciplines and AA's make them more efficient, usually when holding taunt
isn't the key problem).

Killing Enforcers / Punishers in PoJ for something to do, me 62nd Wizard,
friend playing his 62nd Paladin, friend playing her 65th Druid, and last
friend playing his 62nd Shaman.

Paladin pacifies (or whichever spell he has), pulls, and starts tanking.
Then what?

Instantly, shaman slows, druid dots, and I start nuking.

Mob is now slow, Druid doesn't need to dump any early heals, can wait for
the right moment for her most efficient CHeal.  I'm still nuking.

Shaman drops a few dots, Druid nukes a bit.

All the while Paladin is happily dropping stuns and whacking the mob a bit.

0 aggro for any caster.  One person to heal, no one else, ever.  As
importantly, mob is slowed from the outset, so we don't have 8-15 seconds
of full on attacks while waiting for a safe slow.

Because my wizard is virtually chain nuking, the mob dies very quickly.
Suddenly, the limiting factor on how quick we can kill these things is the
wizard's mana, not the Druid or Shaman.

Same story fighting Golems in PoV.  We sat at one of the camps for about 10
hours that day, without our Paladin, picking up one DPS slot, one tank and
one puller during the day, as required.  I think we had about 6 tanks in
the end.  A few warriors and a few paladins.  Without a shadow of a doubt,
the Paladins were more efficient.  Those golems hit hard, so having them
slowed from the outset is a huge advantage.  I don't have the concussion
spell (so no aggro reducer on my wizard), and my 500point rune doesn't last
long against those golems, so I'm nuking cautiously, and ramping it up
until I find I can't take aggro unless I start chain casting the huge nuke.
With our warriors, it was just harder.  Sometimes the shaman gets whacked
for long enough that it becomes a battle to save him, sometimes I get
whacked once in passing, enough to drop the rune and use up a dot (yay
forceshield), sometimes the first slow is resisted, and now you've already
waited for a while, so the tank needs another CHeal and suddenly the druid
is under attack and the shaman is trying to decide if he heals or slows.

Don't get me wrong, we had some good warriors, one guy rocked, had a stun
procing weapon, took aggro, had lots of defensive AA's and didn't need that
much healing before the slow stuck.  But it was definitely more efficient
with the Paladin up front.

Don't forget either - every time the stun lands, that's another few seconds
without any damage output from the bad guy - so not only do they hold hate
like it was going out of fashion, they also lower a mob's DPS both slowed
and unslowed, if the stuns land.  It's that which places them slightly
higher on my preferred tank list than SK's.
