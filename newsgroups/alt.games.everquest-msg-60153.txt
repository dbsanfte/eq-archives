And I can describe the temperature in exact numbers, but doing so
doesn't adequately express the concept of "cold".

From what I've seen, they often don't. 

But for the purposes of this thread, you cannot be compared to a jury
- you're a petitioner. It is the task of a jury to weigh the evidence
and the credibility of the source. You're stating your case, which is
in opposition to the case others are stating. The *reader* of your
posts is the jury - and that reader now understands the credibility of
your statements; they're based on hearsay, while the statements of
others are based upon personal experience.
