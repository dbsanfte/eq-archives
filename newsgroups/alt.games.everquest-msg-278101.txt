Foulgill hasn't been too bad for us, I don't think I've ever waited more 
than an hour, but yeah, camping in general sucks. I do like his drops 
however (I'm still wearing his Stinkhoop) so there's that. Every time I pass 
the docks I check for him and if he's up and I jump in and wrestle him down. 
Lately he's being camped more and more (by an equal number of SS questers 
and botters, but that's another story ...)

Ah yes, I forgot to mention that. First time we fought Mago he depopped on 
us and we had to wait another two hours before he respawned. Since then 
we've learned that it is indeed 15 minutes from the time you gain aggro and 
you're right, that's not generally a problem if you have two full groups 
with decent DPS. Been a while since I've seen that issue come up.

LOL!

Wow, wish we'd known that! You can imagine how we felt the first time we 
fought and saw the room start filling up with lava around us! I will give 
your strat a try one of the next times that we're there (which will probably 
be tonight, given everyone's reaction to my new boots ...)

> You'll get him.

Aye, got him last night in a much easier battle. Not sure why it was that 
much easier, sometimes just knowing what to expect changes everything.

Thanks,
