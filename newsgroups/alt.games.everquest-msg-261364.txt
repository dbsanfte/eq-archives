Sadly, yes.   In PoP and GoD, they locked single group content behind raid
only flags.   Planes of Tactics, Earth, Fire and Tower of Solusek Ro are all
very nice zones to do Exp groups in, but you cannot reach them without
having multiple raid flags completed.  (You can exp in Water too, but it's
more annoying.)  Planes of Air and Time are the only "raid only" zones in
that expansion.

About half of the GoD zones (I won't even bother trying to spell the names
correctly) are similar, in that a single group can do very well there for
experience, but they need either raid or trial flags to zone in.  (A trial
being an extremely hard single group event that takes several hours to
complete... not exaclty pickup group material.)

And yes, I consider it to be one of Sony's stupider moves.   Happily they
did not repeat the mistake with OOW.
