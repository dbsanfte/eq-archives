    Most Elder Granitebacks were still blue to my then-42 rogue. The
Highland Tigers were mostly-green.

    Yes. I've seen details on EQTraders or The Safehouse (can't remember
which). The new weapons have some CHA and a bunch of lower-level resists.
The weapons that fit in the ranged slot actually make nice resist items
afterwards.

    I don't know about leaving other factions intact, but this explains
something I observed in The Warrens: there's a named Erudite in the jail
cells in the Prince wing, in a cell with some named Kejekans. Killing him,
you see something like this:

Your faction standing with Gatecallers has decreased.
Your faction standing with Heretics has improved.
Your faction standing with Heretics has improved.

    Yes, it lists Heretics twice. I'm guessing the second listing is, in
fact, the necro guild in town.
