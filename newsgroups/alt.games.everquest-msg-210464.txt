I had my 2HS and 1HS maxed for each level.  I did not start working on 2HB
until I was level 53.  It is nice when you are in a guild that understands
it when you need to raise a weapon skill.  I was not MT during a group in
Veksar and in three hours, I raised my 2HB from 5-113.  In another day and a
half I had a 200+ in 2hb.  Now it is on par with my 2hs.  At 56 now, I
solely use a Grearstaff of Thunder 2HB.  It is a 31/30 2HB weapon with a
sweet Planar Stun proc.  The proc does no damage but does good agro against
mobs.  If I am in a group where another warrior is MTing then I use my
Windblade 50/44 2HS.  The dps from the windblade is totally out of this
world.  So far my highest crit using it at level 55 was 437.
