Don't know that I would go with it for a group of 5, maybe 6, but I've 
always thought the idea of 3 rogues was interesting. They surround the mob 
and ping pong it chaining backstabs. You could throw in a cleric and a 
chanter for heals, cc, haste and slow.

Not the most efficient group, but may be interesting.
