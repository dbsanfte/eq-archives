At no time did I insult the Necro class in general. I came to discuss a bad 
incident and learn through discusion from people who would know. If this 
offends thee, dear palindrome, I suggest you skip on over my posts and find 
threads that seek not to educate, but to slap each other on your backs of 
how wonderful you are, and how the game could not exist without you.

Anyone claiming they do not need another class in the game and say they are 
self-sufficient isn't playing the game the way it was intended. Each class 
brings its own unique tools to the table, to enhance the game and make it 
most effective. With a chip on your shoulder and going it alone... you are 
really missing out. Helping each other out and being a productive member of 
the GROUP is the way it should be. Insulting one another and insinuating you 
can do better on your own only hurts yourself. I feel sorry for you that you 
have not gotten the true spirit of Norath. Perhaps a good old game of 
solitaire would be more your cup of tea?

Oh... and how do you know the sun does not shine out of my "arse?" I keep 
players alive to see a new day... not sure where that daylight shines forth 
from. But I do know I get followed around alot asking me to be THEIR cleric 
in their group. Perhaps I should take a look around? I bet the world is 
brighter back there?
