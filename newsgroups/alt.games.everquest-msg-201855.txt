On most armor yes.  I forget the exact piece my friend couldn't dye, but it
was a pair of boots.  I don't think Golden Efreeti Boots for example can be
dyed.  Otherwise yeah.  you can dye most armor any color.  ie, you can make
a bloodstained tunic (normally a red tint) look like regular silver mail.
There is no tint left from original armor color.  I've done it.  and the
closest you can get to "clear/silver" is 254, 254, 254

I use 252, 252, 252 though.

0,0,0 is black.
