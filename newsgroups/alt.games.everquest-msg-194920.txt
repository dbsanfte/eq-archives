Logged in tonight and recieved an update of eqmain.dll  Splash
screen showed the april 23rd message regarding the tip of the day
etc., which I've already read long since.  Tried logging in and
got "could not connect" serveral times, then I got a connection,
big splash of the same message, and on to server select.

Selected Terris Thule and something new, got message saying they
"could not connect to that world server, please select another
one" but sadly dumped not back to server select but to the
login.  Several tries worth of "could not connect" later I
ditched and came here to... comment in a positive and information
sharing manner.

Sounds like itch starts with a b

Ergh
