   No, I didn't.  At least not at first.  I think I might have made one about
halfway through.  I don't remember.  But we only were in the second room.  I
wasn't spending much time running back from pulling.  It didn't seem to me that
the tanks were taking too long to jump on whatever I brought back.

   Possibly.  I was pulling with cancel magic.  Then I would run to where the
tanks were, and stand still waiting for it or them (was bringing back 1 and 2's)
to turn away from me.  If my health got towards the 50% mark, as it seemed to do
alot, I would try Celestial healing myself, rooting them, and backing off.  And
it wasn't taking very long for me to get down to the 50% mark, so I was casting
on myself fairly quickly.  I suppose that might have caused extra agro, though
my experience is that Celestial is a pretty low agro spell in itself.

   I guess in hindsight, I should have been rooting them first, and backing
away, not just stating there for ten or more seconds waiting for the tanks to
get agro.  I'm pretty sure that most of what I brought back was undead, and
don't they have more of a tendency to stick to proximity agro?  I was just
thinking that standing still would be easier for them than having to chase me
and the mob around, but I might not be right in that.

   Oh, and I don't know if the shaman was slowing or not.  When I got back to
the party, I was focused pretty closely on watching the health bars of myself
and the party, not watching spell messages.
