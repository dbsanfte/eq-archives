In answer to the second part, no, you cannot log into the same account on
two characters.  You used to be able to (in the first year).  At the time,
all they had was a 'cheaters log', and when you logged into two characters
it would be 'updated'.  But not it won't even let you on.  Sadly, most
people now-a-days have two (or more) accounts.  I know I do =0P.
