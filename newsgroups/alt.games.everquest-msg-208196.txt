Even being an admitted hitpoint junky, I'd probably take a 60 mana
item over a 10hp item. Heh, I'd have to think about it though.

One thing I've never regretted is maxing out wisdom on character
creation. My wisdom would have been around 100 all the way up to 50th
lvl and without troll regen or an ikkyBP/Fungi that would've been
tight. These days with much better and cheaper gear available, it
probably isn't an issue. Even now my wisdom would be under 190 if I
hadn't put 25 points into it while my stamina is maxed (255) with
brute and PE.

Since getting cann5, the only time I'll run out of mana is when I have
to spam Tnarg's mending to try and keep a tank alive. At 450 a pop,
that one is a mana hog. But the times I run out of mana is certainly
less than 1/10th of the times that I've run out of Hitpoints <g>. It's
probably less of a problem now, I dinged 65 and scribbed quiessence
last night.
