You shouldnt write people off just because of their outward apperence.

For example a few months back the battery on my car was playing up causing
it to be somewhat reluctant to start, it didnt help matters that it was 9pm
on a very frosty night.

Well needless to say my car once again refused to start and I was faced with
a long walk home to get help (I had left my jumpleads in the garage and my
mobile phone is never one my person, I hate those things).

Just as I got out the car and gave it one last kick (that will make it work
for sure) this HUGE guy walks over to me I look him up and down as he gets
closer and I notice he has a mohican (sp?) is covered in tattos, wearing
biking leathers and could no doubt tear be in two by just sneezing on me.

So I'm thinking, great my cars knackered and now I'm going to be mugged by
this monster of a bloke, as he gets closer he thrusts out his hand and I
kinda wait for the impact on my rather feeble head ... and wait ... and wait
... then I shake his hand =)

He introduces himself as John (I wont include his last name) and hes a
machanic for a nearby garage doing some late night shopping ... anyway 15
minutes later my cars underway and I have a new friend ...

Oh and one other thing, never go drinking with a ex-punk machanic you will
regret it the next day ...
