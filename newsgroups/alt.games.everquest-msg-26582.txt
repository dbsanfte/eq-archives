There IS no single zone for it.

As you will find, there are 2 places to get Blocks of MQ ore Highpass Keep 
and the Rathe Mountains.  Somewhere in Gnome land you can get bricks of MQ 
ore which you can combine into blocks of MQ ore, which is not a process you 
want to deal with if you can avoid it.

Since MQ Folded Sheets are now stackable, it makes the most sense to base 
yourself in Freeport, since the molds do NOT stack.  You'll get your small 
molds from Neriak and your medium molds from Freeport.  You would have to 
run all the way to Halas to get a large mold, but I have found very little 
demand for Large FSP - even the Barbs can wear medium (and should since 
it's lighter), so the only demand for large comes from Trolls and Ogres 
(and only Warriors and Shadowknights at that).

And I'm not even addressing the making of Leather Padding.

Forget about Ornate Chain.  It's at least as much work to get the 
ingredients as FSP, and is virtually unsellable.
