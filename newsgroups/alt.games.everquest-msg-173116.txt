I had KEI (the extended version) cast on my level 19 Ranjah as of
yesterday on Test. So if it's going live, it wasn't tested. Therefore, I
doubt it.

(Before any of you blow up, no... I wasn't looking for KEI for my
Ranger. I was getting ready to practice fletching and auctioned to
donate for a Wis/Int buff to improve my chances for skillups. The
chanter who answered just happened to give me the whole package.)
