I've been playing since Jan of 2000, and was frothing at the mouth and
having seiziures by the time I finally got on last night.  Of course it
was all my fault anyways, as Yesterday was my day off.  first thing I
said to my guild was:
"I'm finally on, give me something to kill before I get disconnected and
the convulsions start again."
