The time he has is from when he casts bolt until it hits.  No amount
of running on his part is going to change that time.

Your suggestion that he wait until bolt hits completely misses the point,
which is to invis himself before the mob is hit.

He got the idea, if you read further, from a rogue using an insta
click invis item to invis himself after throwing but before the weapon
hits.  I think (but its not clear to me, having missed the original rogue
post) that the targetted mob sees the person who sent the damage
towards him, but doesn't pass the message to his friends for some reason,
although he would if the damager was visible.  This would result in
single pulling the mob out of its group.  If it works for that rogue, it
should work for the wizard... maybe.

To test it out, I'd go pick up some Cloudy Potions (one charge
insta click invis, available at any potions vendor for around 11pp.) and
try the bolt pull with insta invis.  If this works, then go back to trying
to figure out how to make the bolt take a little longer and/or the invis
cast a little faster.

Another idea, have someone there to cast invis on you, he can start
his cast timed so it will finish casting after you start (or finish) casting
the bolt and before it connects.  This is the technique used to port
invisible into those nasty death trap rings (Iceclad, SF) and I don't
see what would stop it working here.
