To be honest(since I've been planning an upgrade myself), anything much over
450 will require a new motherboard, since at least the Pentium IV and AMD
Athlon/Thunderbird etc use either Slot A or Socket A rather than Socket 7.
And then of course, with the Pentium IV you have to use Rambus memory rather
than standard 168-pin DIMM's, which is a whole other can o' worms.
