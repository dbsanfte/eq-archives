Frankly, my dear, I don't take stuff "personally" on Usenet. However,
some folks are <normally> more fun to debate than others, particularly
when it comes to subjects that I find of intense interest in the game.
High end dungeons and their impact on game play, interaction of the
guild structure, these are all favorite topics of mine to read about,
discuss, and hear opinions. ANd until this unexpected flurry, James is
generally one of the most well spoken (written) and interesting people
to debate.

Where James came up with the "because you pissed me off" and the ensuing
declarations about Sleepers is a mystery to me. My take on guilds waking
the sleeper is nothing more than that... "MY" take (i.e. opinion) on the
subject. However, I'll grant you, my discussion tone may change quite a
bit when I run into a "holier-than-thou" type who want's to make a
negative pronouncement on a broad swath of the entire post 55 player
base, rooted solely in *their* "opinion".

However, if it's going to sink even further, then fine. I concede, if
for no other reason than lack of stamina to keep up this endless cycle
of opinions. Fine and Dandy. James wins. I lose. Every member of every
guild who's ever woken the sleeper is a soulless greedy bastard who
sodomizes their mother in her prison cell, and if they could all only
follow James' guild's sterling example of angelic benevolence, all of
Norrath would be sunshine, daisies, and warm fuzzy bunnies on Sunday
afternoons.

> Normally you're one of the amiable and polite types around here.

You're the second person to say that lately. I *must* install a security
camera and see who's using my machine to post when I'm not home.

> Sui, doubtless in for sarcasm and vitriol of her own now.

Well, one hates to disappoint.
Piss off.
