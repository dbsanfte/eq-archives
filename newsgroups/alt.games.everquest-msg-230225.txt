One of us is, at least.

I've made note of the suggestion, but could use a little help on how to
file the interpretation.  The best I've come up with so far is, "Don't
poke small fools with little better to do than defend their imaginary
grounds with third-grade curses."

: Who gives a shit? So what's your point? Political correctness for all?

I prefer the term, "Civil correctness."  But as you may be one of those
"'90s kind of guy[s]" who bought into the idea that compassion for other
people is the mark of the beast himself, as opposed to a prerequisite for
looking oneself in the mirror when they wake up in the morning, I'll have
to leave it to you to establish the proper, and modern, mode of respect 
here.  After all -- who am I?  How many tons of "shit" have I freighted in 
this newsgroup, or asked other to spread on my behaft, here or in game?

How could I ever stand up to your overwhelming, fecal tonnage?  Your 
crappy might?  The answer is..  "Shit!"  I can't!

: Whatever. Of course, if this made some kind of logical sense in
: anyone's mind but yours, you may have a point. As it stands, you're
: just adding to the self-righteous prick side of things.
: Oh yeah... and what is your point?

I surrender to your excretory intellect!  Please, stop carpet-bombing me 
with your smart-bombs of.. uh..  "shit!"  Yeah, that's it!

And your children too!  Please, will someone think of..

: Oh, fuck you. Keep your fucking sprog out of the game and it won't
: have to deal with me.

Wait, I forgot.  Haven't any children, myself.  You?

Haven't any reason to hate children, either.  You?  Why is it, if I -- or
anyone else -- might decide to have children, we would have reason to fear
how you would deal with them?

: You apparently are quite out of touch with the
: language used, drugs used, drive-by shootings done, schools blown up
: and general horseshit done by these <children> you seem so quick to
: defend.

Hmm..  Watch a little TV, do we?  Goose Creek, maybe?  But no drugs there.  
Columbine?  Didn't really blow the school up, though.  Maybe you were
thinking of _Heathers_?  Another fiction hidden (I say thankfully) in your 
own, private mind?

This hatred you imagine and project -- well, it's a free world, isn't it?  
You're free to brew whatever ugly conceits you wish to store in your
thick, impacted cranium.  But that's the weird thing..

: Instead of shooting off your overly self-righteous and
: terminally politically correct mouth with some brain dead opinion
: again, maybe you ought to try reading what's going on in the real
: world.

Freedom, in case you haven't realized or heard it spelled out in painful,
mono-syllabic words to youself, is a two-way street.  One man's "brain
dea[th]" is another man's feast.  The difference, which I'll return to
again, is that while both of us obviously delight in piling "crap" on the
other, you're the only one on record that advocates the general expansion
of hate speech as a societal panacea.

: By the way, did I mention you really come off like a self-righteous
: prick?

Two of us, at least.

Though I must object to the self-righteous part..
