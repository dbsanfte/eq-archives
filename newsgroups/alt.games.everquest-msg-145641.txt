lol....i remember being in a group one time, i cant remember which
class i was...they blur together sometimes, and i saw a rogue oocing
for a group. since im usually sympathetic towards rogues and wizards
getting a group i said "hey...lets get that rogue". moron group leader
said no...because rogue might pickpocket the mobs and take money from
group.

NATURAL SELECTION AT WORK!

these kind of folks kill themselves off before long. i guess my main
problem has more to do with the fact that idiots like this exist more
than rogues having a hard time. but verant doesnt make it easier
though. like you said....it shouldnt be easy for the uber classes
pre-50. its sort of like how on every server druids come a dime a
dozen then whine when they get to end game raids because they truly
arent needed. in this case the whining comes for the first 50
something levels while the druids happily quad all the pumas they
want.
