1) So you're in a guild with problems, problems you won't disclose to 
anyone outside the guild.

2) You want people in other guilds, on your specfic server, however to 
to disclose their problems. (Seems a touch hypocritical right out of the 
gate)

3) You want to do this discourse *in game*


Did it ever occur to you that a simple ooc in the pok (ie *in game*) or 
other gathering site *on your server* would have a much higher chance of 
reaching people on your server, who are logged on at the same time you 
are, and are available to talk at the same time you are???
