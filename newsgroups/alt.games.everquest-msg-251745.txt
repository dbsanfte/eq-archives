Not really 100 pp in bazaar. I've finally got my tradeskills high enough to
complete the quest myself, by the time the item would be a serious downgrade
for me. By the time I get them high enough to finish the Aid Grimel quest I
expect not to want the end result of that either:

Signet of Might
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP
Slot: EAR
AC: 25

or

Signet of the Arcane

Those are also pretty sweet items you can't find in the bazaar. That
quest does require a few if not raid drops then at least raid flags though.
The 10th coldain ring is still a bit better than any melee ring I've seen
in the bazaar:

Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP
Slot: FINGER
AC: 10
STR: +10 STA: +10 HP: +100
SV MAGIC: +10
Effect: Frostreaver's Blessing (Must Equip, Casting Time: Instant)
WT: 0.1 Size: SMALL
Class: ALL
Race: ALL
Slot 1, Type 7

and the instant click effect is nice against dispelling mobs. Obviously these
are the last steps of these progressive quests, and most intermediate steps
are worse than bazaar gear these days.

Some epics are still nice as you say, although generally for the effect, not
the stats. In fact bards have kind of a love/hate relationship with their
epic, with a modifier to all instruments that means you are stuck with a 
Kunark era weapon in your off hand until you collect either several EP/Time
loots or expensive LDoN augments (with the LDoN gear with the correct slots
to put it in).
