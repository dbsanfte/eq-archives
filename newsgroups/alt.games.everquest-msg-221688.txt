I agree with most of the replies i've seen. Fighting either.  GD to EW, DL to BW With EW as an addon, CC works ok to around 49-50 with ok cash.

LDoN if you have it. or shoot for 46 and hit a plane.

Also. remember you have 8 slots. I used all 8 of my slots and have a nice army of PCs to run with. when i get bored with 1 class i switch over.
