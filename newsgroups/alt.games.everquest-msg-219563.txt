Heres a little more about that lesson:

A few weeks ago you were hearing a lot of wailing and gnashing of
teeth from Democrats and some Republicans in Washington about the size
of the projected budget deficit.� Democrats almost exclusively blamed
this deficit on the Bush tax cuts and stood in line to say that these
tax cuts should be turned around.
Funny ... you haven't heard a lot about this budget deficit lately,
have you?� Do you know why? It's because the projected budget deficit
is actually shrinking, not growing.� When the budget deficit grows
that's bad news for the President and, therefore, good enough news to
put on the TV newscasts and the front pages of the major newspapers.�
But, when that projected deficit shrinks it's actually good news for
the President, and good news is news that's not fit to print or
broadcast for many "journalists" out there.
Now ... just why have the projected deficits been shrinking?� No, it's
not because government is scaling back its spending.� It's because the
Imperial Federal Government is experiencing a sharp increase in tax
revenues.� That's right, an increase!�� It's no small increase in
federal tax revenues either.� Try this figure ---- $85 Billion.�
That's with a "B."� The current estimate of tax revenues to the
federal government is $85,000,000,000 higher right now than it was one
month ago.� The left and the Democrats have been warning that the Bush
tax cuts would lead to lower tax revenues, the fiscal conservatives
have been saying just the opposite.� Well ... guess who wins this one.
 Hint:� It's not the left.
Once again .. just as with both the Kennedy and Reagan tax cuts, we're
seeing an increase in government revenues.� Don't you Democrats just
hate it?
