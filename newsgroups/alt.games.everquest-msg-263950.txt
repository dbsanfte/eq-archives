Sadly, not that I've found. I always want this and rarely see it 
implemented. Probably would involve some significant hoops to go through to 
have to track and manage infinitely growing accumulations of text for every 
character. But I'd love to see it. I *want* to be able to annotate why 
so-and-so is on my ignore list, and why such-and-such is on my friend's 
list. Who *hasn't* wanted this?
