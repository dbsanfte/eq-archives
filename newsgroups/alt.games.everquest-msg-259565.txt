Other PC steals the kill. :(

EQ gives the kill to whoever entity (independant individual/group/raid)
does the most attribited damage.

Ie when the mob dies:

It looks at each independant entity on the hate list and says how much 
damage did you do, and awards xp to the highest number.

Plus beware: 

Damage from DSes aren't attributed and so don't count towards the total 
either... so in the example you gave if the PC had done 5 damage, and 
the DS had done 280, and you finish it off with a 20 point bash you'll 
still yank the xp.

/agree

Been there :)

Sometimes its tgb, and you are just included. Sometimes they don't look 
what class you are, and sometimes they just wouldn't know better if they 
did look =)
