What's funny is when it involves characters who were *not*
created and named for the purpose.

Recently, while news of the bombing trial was current in
the news, two high-level guys on my server named "Terrist"
and "Panam" realized they just *had* to duel at least once
in EC:

    "Terrist has defeated Panam in a duel to the death!"

Black humor, but humor nonetheless.
