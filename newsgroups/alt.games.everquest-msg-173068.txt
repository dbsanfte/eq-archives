Hey, don't get me wrong. I still play in spite of the low level
issues. However, he has a point. If any of us had picked up the box in
the beginning and read an honest accounting on the side of the box of
what the first 20 to 40 hours were going to be like, we would have
probably dropped it like a hot rock.

Keep it in perspective. A player new to the game has no idea what the
eventual payoff might be. What reason do they have to tolerate the
tedium in the beginning? I can't blame them. All we can do is tell
them it gets much better and let them make up their own minds.
