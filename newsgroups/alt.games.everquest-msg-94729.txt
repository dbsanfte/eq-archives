I have information/proof that GM's routinely favor specific guilds and/or
players.
My question is, is this old news? Does anyone care?

See to me this means that the game is crap, unless your the pet of a GM
some jerk who IS the pet of a GM can run all over you.

So why pay whatever to get screwed by some GMs pet.

Hey I am only asking questions. If anyone cares I will post the URL
or copy the post here. Its pretty damming.

Of course maybe I am totally wrong and no one cares.
