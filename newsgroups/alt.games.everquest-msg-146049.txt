OK, then clerics were on that bottom rung alone.  Now there
is no class down there in the sub-basement of norrath damage
output.  Did you really think clerics liked sitting on their butts?
A single spell, a worthless one really when concieved, has
been the bane of any cleric who actually wanted to enjoy
himself in the post Kunark world; since we can CHeal and
there are tanks out there with enough HP to warrant this,
we're supposed to sit and look small, try not to draw attention.

Well Bergh is my second cleric, and I happily avoided this
cliche from 1 to 44 as a backup melee who could still put
out more healing than any other class, because I designed
him as melee from the start.  Post 44 his ability to do more
than sit on his buttocks and think about beer became more
and more limited, harder and harder to pull off without
actually reducing the effectiveness of his groups... now
after a month at 60 he suddenly gets to be exactly what
I always dreamed of, a melee effective healer, ala AD&D
and a host of other fantasy RPGs.

I'm saddened by what this does to the paladin, who I see
as 75% warrior 25% healer, where cleric should be 25%
warrior 75% healer... but I'm not clear where the
fix lies.

Note that a lot of the new cleric damage output has always
been available, and is just as screwed up in many ways
as it always has been.  Long a favorite toy of mine, the
UHOF, laughingstock of the pet world, has gained a great
deal of respect not by being changed, but by having its
casting COST (and to a lesser extent its cast time) reduced.

The darn thing still has 100 hp, is still deaf as a post,
and still kills itself when its target dies unless you have
another carefully lined up for it.  But look at that damage
output list and you'll observe that the darn thing did a good
deal more damage than the cleric himself did.

I've been casting the UHOF in situations where other
clerics would have dropped in a couple nukes, where
mana flow wasn't a critical issue, in other words.  Its
quite effective... but was never really worth the mana.
Now that mana cost is cut more than in half, its worth
throwing into all but the tightest situations.   Do you
complain about the mage pet, the beastlord pet, the
necro pet?  They are all still superior to the cleric pet,
more damage out put, more HP, and you summon them
once and they stay around for ages.

Another part of that "amazing" damage output was
Mark of Retribution.  This spell is nice enough, but
isn't a patch on a comperable DS.  DS is far more
damage, doesn't aggro the mobs, is never resisted, and
works with a single cast on several mobs in a row.
As I pointed out before, it also doesn't scale one little
tiny bit, so once you have one cleric casting it, you can
subtract that segment of the damage out of the formula
for all the other clerics pounding away.

Yet another part of the damage output was the proc
off the summoned hammer.  While the proc is great
and the proc rate is amazing (with the roughly 100 dex
boost between weapon and Yaulp V) we simultaneously
see a route for about 70 high end clerics per server to
get their epic, which is a vastly inferior weapon that
gives a LOT more mana and HP... so in most situations,
lame as it is, most clerics are going to be hanging on
to the old ball and chain.
