I like sitting down and working on tradeskills etc.
You get to meet lots of people, catch up with friends old and new alike and
although my main is only 36, l enjoy helping out newbies to the game.
Everyone has different reasons for playing the game, that's part of what
makes
it interesting.
Imagine how scary EQ would be if all players were like you....
