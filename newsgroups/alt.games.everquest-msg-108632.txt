The story behind the triggered Faydedar says that he's injured and
hiding out in the oasis after being left for dead by a raiding party
that found him while he was chasing a froglok. You can lure him out
with the smell of froglok, but "The dern thing's broken, bleedin, and
cornered. That's a mighty deadly position to put a critter in if ye
ask me." So, if he is cranky be default, that's only to be expected.
