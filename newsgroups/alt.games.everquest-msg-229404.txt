Have you considered the "yard trash" in Plane of Nightmare?  I'm not
sure if the xp would be good enough for you there but I would imagine
with a tanking Shadowknight, his pet, your pet, and your awesome DoT's
you could do well.  Plus, do necro's have the ability to heal players
by taking hit points from a mob and transferring it to someone other
than themselves?
