I'm curious... <why> do people cast lev and dmf on other people
unsolicited? (I virtually always cancel it after the person leaves)
I've been in groups where people do this and I find it annoying as
hell unless it's a situation where it's needed.... excuse me, but for
some reason I just don't seem to require a dmf to hunt in South
Karana.... funniest thing is, I'm a friggin' <druid>... if I wanted to
fly, I'd cast it on myself!


-----------
The same thing happened to me hunting in EK.  I turned around and looked
at the player who cast on me, cancelled the Levitate right then and
continued
my fight.  I'm a Shaman so I can cast Levitate on myself anyway.

I always appreciate Clarity of course, and will reciprocate with SoW without
thinking twice about it.  If I am medding near a zone and see someone low on
life
I will often heal them and give a few free buffs unasked, esp. for lower
level
characters.
