I finally got my dark elf necro to level 24 and was looking forward to the new 
pet.  However . . .

I cannot find the Words of Detachment to save my life.  Well, okay, I did find 
them twice, but messed up combining with the Words of Possession and Allure to 
get the Haunting Corpse spell.  My questions are:

Why are the Words of Detachment so hard to find for purchase, and how many 
times will I have to try COMBINE before it works?  My research is maxed at 
this level, BTW.

One more question . . . is there something else involved with getting this 
spell I don't know about?  Thanks!
