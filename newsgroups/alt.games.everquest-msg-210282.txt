Others have suggested alternatives.  However, I'd say stick with "TRAIN".
The purpose is to warn others that something is coming that they may need to
deal with.  That is most effective when the warning is consistent.  "TRAIN"
will leap out at them...they've learned over many levels to watch out for
that word.  The cute alternatives will be like regular zone chatter, until
they read it.  If they are busy, it will be much easier to miss than the
normal "TRAIN".
