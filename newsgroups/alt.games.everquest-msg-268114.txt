I think the number of news admins that bother to monitor alt.admin can
be counted without removing your shoes at this point. The big news
distribution servers dont have filter lists or even newsgroup lists
anymore. They are more news routers than servers at this point, they
pass on anything they get. Outside universities, news admins aren't paid
enough to care anymore, and have way too much to do to bother checking
if a newsgroup recieved a proper discussion.
