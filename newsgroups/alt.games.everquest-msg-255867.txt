I like hippy shit.  I am old.  Well not *that* old but pretty old.
I guess I just question the motives of someone who offers you something
*outrageous* for *nothing*.  
And, maybe, in all honesty, something "that" valuable *in my mind* requires
more than just *gratitude*, and *I* would feel indebted to the other person. 
So it wouldn't be free *to me*.
And maybe I *am* old, because I was raised to think you should work for your
stuff.  And the better *stuff* I want the harder I'm going to have to work for
it.  
That said, I *don't* think that raiding is necessarily harder than other eq
adventuring.
