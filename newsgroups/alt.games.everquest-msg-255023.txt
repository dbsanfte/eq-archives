Worse, dwarves are race restricted from using Fierce Heraldic even if they
do worship Rallos Zek.

For cultural armors, Barbarian warriors of the Tribunal have the best
warrior armor.  Second best is any non-dwarf warrior of Rallos Zek.   The
Rallos Zek armor (Fierce Heraldic) is generally much cheaper than the
Tribunal armor (Helenic Tundra), since so many more smiths are creating it
to sell.

Lack of a cultural armor certainly isn't a game breaker (especially if
you're untwinked and can't afford it anyways)... but it would make the game
easier to have a cheap purchasable armor that is better than some of my
(Velious/Early Luclin) raid gear.
