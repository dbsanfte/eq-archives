Hang out here a bit more - usually unfolds like this:

a_unsuspectingposter_00: what's this XYZ all about?
bizbee: RTFM moron, how the fuck could a loser like you even manage to
subscribe to a game like EQ without having the reading comprehension to
RTFM?
a_unsuspectingposter_00: what the? Don't be such an asshole I was only
asking a question...
Lokari: only losers resort to name calling.
Dark Tyger: what she said you loser.

Did I leave anything out?  I ask that of those who have been around here
longer than the couple of months I've been back lurking and *daring* a post
on occasion because it was no different a year ago when I was dabbling with
EQ and came here seeking advice.

I'm still puzzled as to why bizbee hasnt' joined the fray - unless it's
because he remembers your contributions to rgcuo and has decided to
stand-down and let his hounds handle you instead.  Quite a gentleman that
bizbee, (for a fucking lunatic).
