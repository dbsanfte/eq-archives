At 29th, you get Bonds of Force and this makes soloing much easier.

Why not?  I didn't know about Solusek Ro when I made my Wizard (he was
one of my original EQ characters) so I am agnostic.  If I had to do
again, I'd make him a Solusek Ro worshipper.

Mine is a Gnome.  Gnome Powa!

PS I'm curious why you want to play a Wizard?  Mages are more powerful
(pets and nukes).  Enchanters are more interesting (mind games and
charm).  Wizards do one thing really well (teleports) but that is
pretty much it.
