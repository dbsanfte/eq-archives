Lots of people think that you being a druid is only for their sow needs.
Had a sow beggar (in the other end of the zone, hate when people do a 
/who to see who they can beg buffs from) told me that if i didnt want to 
sow him, i shouldnt play a class that could sow.
For some wierd reason he never talked to me again after i informed him 
that if he wanted sow, he should go play a class that could sow.

If people are near me i sow, but since around 80% of the sow beggars 
just do a /who to see who they can beg a sow from and then expect me to 
either run to them, or wait for them to run somewhere to meet me. Those 
people i never sow.
Same with those stupid "Need sow at XXX" shouters. Noone need sow, its 
merely a nice thing to have.
