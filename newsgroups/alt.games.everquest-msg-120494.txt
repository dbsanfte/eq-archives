Heya all,

So last night I begged the question in /gu "What is the easiest or cheapest 
regen item I can get for my monk or flowing thought item I can get for my 
druid?"

I'm interested in your input.

I know I can search Allakhazam, but their prices are always off and that 
doesn't tell me which one is easiest to acquire. Not to mention the fact 
that regen effects include "Regen" and "Fungal Regrowth" and...
