I loaded the 40.41s last night (WinXP)

EQ runs great! I played for about 3 hours without any problems.

There is a new control panel tab, that allows you to force Anisotropic
filtering (without using a tweak program like RivaTuner). It really
cleans up the texture crawl and shimmering. I'm running with mine set
to 4X Aniso, FSAA Off, Best Image Quality.

The one "problem" (if you can call it that) is that the default gamma
settings for D3D are a bit dark. I recommend raising them in the
advanced display options (1.2-1.3) before adjusting gamma in-game.
