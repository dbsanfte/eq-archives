Greetings all, just some confusion in the mind of a young barbarian
shaman,

The Barbarians in EQ are the `proto humans' from which all other
human races spring. Created by the gods Erollisi Marr (she of the
truly EQ proportions) and Mithaniel Marr and their empire, known
as the combine empire, was huge and powerful....until it collapsed
leaving only ruins.

So given that who the hell are the tribunal? The Shaman are a
priest class who have no choices other than the tribunal. It's
also the only uniquely barbarian faith (I can't worship the gods
who created me?). They seem a hell of a lot less interesting
than `real' gods, and doesn't seem like they have any existence
in game at all.

Has the reason for the collapse of the combine empire ever been
hinted at in-game?

Given that shaman are `bringers of justice' why do I have to buy
lots of my spells from outcasts? And given that lots of them are
spells of poison and disease (Pox of Bertoxxulus? Bane of Nife?)
or necromantic I'm beginning to wonder exactly what the tribunal
stand for.
