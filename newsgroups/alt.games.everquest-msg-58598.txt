Yeah, all the giants and drakkel wolves raise cov in addition to
coldain. They don't raise it much though. If you are only kindly with
Coldain, when everyone starts out at apprehensive, you are probably
still scowl with Cov since everyone starts out at deep scowl. At best
you'd be threaten. The velious factions are pretty huge distances from
say the start of threaten to glower, cov especially seems that way.

I think I did a TON of stuff and had great dwarf faction and was
barely just into threaten with cov. It takes tons of time on outdoor
mobs to raise it. I then went on one kael raid and was apprehensive to
cov when done. Another raid or so I was amiable. Kael is really big
faction pluses.

Whoah he is cov faction?

Yeah con the sentries, don't make the mistake I did of going in a bit
and clicking on someone I did not know was a vendor THEN dropping
invis and conning and thinking "Oh im glower to cov!" Surprise
surprise when I was still scowl (vendors start out as glower dubious
at worst)
