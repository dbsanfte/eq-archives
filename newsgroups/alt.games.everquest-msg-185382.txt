    On our raids, Bot9 and Kazad's are MGB'ed, and people that want Virtue
(paladins) ask for single. Warriors usually ask for WoG, too, when they
remember. Now that bards are out of the buff box there's a lot more room to
do multiple buffs like this, and it's a maximal HP/mana regen pairing for
most classes. My buffs, on the average raid:

Lunar Whispers (self)
Blessing of Reverence
Ward of Gallantry
Kazad's Mark
Blessing of the Nine
Focus of the Seventh
Talisman of the Boar
Brell's Stalward Shield
Voice of Quellious
Spiritual Dominion (if a BST shows up)
Protection of Seasons, Guard of Druzzil, Talisman of the Tribunal, Circle of
Summer (depends on resists needed, usually just GoD and PoS up by default)
possibly Blessing of Replenishment if someone casts it on me, but I don't
ask for it.

    So even if for some bizarre reason I have the optional regen and all
four resists on me, I still have one slot open for heals over time or a
debuff. Lots of buff space to play with these days. And with these buffs I'm
a little ways over 6200 HPs from just over 3700 unbuffed, all resists 220 or
above, AC over 1300.
