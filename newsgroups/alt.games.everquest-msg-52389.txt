    It makes sense from a financial viewpoint. SWG is targetted at a much
broader audience than EQ, people who have full time jobs and can't commit
the type of time a game like EQ demands. So give them a less time-intensive
game. I'm one of the first ones to rail against how EQ handles death, mostly
because of the inequities of melee vs. caster binding and the travel
downtime it creates, but what Freeman said is true: death has to have a
sting.

>They also talk of less downtime in doing everything than EQ, and random
>spawns, loot,

    Random spawns and loot stop the thing VI knows would cause the game to
be time-intensive: camping. If everyone wants the Lightsabre of Doom which
drops in ONE place off ONE critter, who only drops ONE when he dies,
there'll be a lineup there. And they want a no-lineups kind of environment.
I don't know what sort of game that'll lead to in the endgame, but it makes
the journey to the endgame more enjoyable.

>new creatures coming when you kill the "nest." etc.

    It'll be interesting to see how this goes over. I imagine it'll be done
on "nothing" mob camps - kill the camp of random Jawas, and next time
Sandpeople will be there. Nobody cares, because they're all random XP/loot
anyways. If this was done in areas with named stuff - do the quest for
Greedo, and Greedo goes poof - well, it'll be interesting to watch. If EQ
has taught us anything it's that players want the world to change AFTER
they've experienced it. And the players that haven't gotten that far yet
almost always howl that they'll never get what the first people got.

    EQ is aimed at people with a lot of time to sink into it. And it works
very, very well in that regard. If I added up the playtimes of all my
characters I'd wince, but that's time I enjoyed myself (by and large). And I
plan to be playing EQ for a good deal more time yet, as there's a great deal
of content that I haven't explored but want to explore.
