Hi,

I just upgraded to a new computer system, and I am in the process of
setting up EQ on it.

A few weeks ago I remember seeing a patch message that referred to a
EQClient.ini setting that was supposed to enable "Hardware Transform
and Lighting" for graphics cards that can support it.

It was one of those lines which can be set to either TRUE or FALSE if I
recall, but I cannot remember the exact line.

Can anyone here tell me what the format for the line is?

I can't seem to find any reference to it in the EQ manual.doc, so perhaps
Verant has changed or removed the setting.

Also, I seem to remember visiting an EQ website that had a "Patch History"
archive of recent patches.  Does anyone know which site this was?

I have been unable to patch for the last couple of weeks, and I would like
to be able to read about any changes that have been patched in while I was
not able to play.

Can anyone help me with either (or both) of these questions?

Many Thanks.

 - Mike Dorr
