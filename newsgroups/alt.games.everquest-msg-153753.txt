    A "decently-equipped" monk pre-Kunark could make 940 AC. See good ol'
Eduin's post on The Steel Warrior for how. And now that you have Iksar monks
that get spotted roughly one point of AC per level, that's even easier. The
real question is this: how did your HPs compare to his? If my warrior is any
guide, real tanks have at least 50% more HPs than monks at lower levels.
Even with Mend, that makes monks worse "tanks".
