I have a few questions about Fishing:

Are there any special catches that become available once you reach
master level, as it happens with Foraging? I haven't found any so far,
but maybe it's my luck.

Does the recycle time of the button decrease as your skill goes up? I
know that the proportion of casts that return a fish increases,
obviously enough, but I haven't really noticed if you can cast more
times per minute.

I'm sick and tired of carrying three poles everywhere... Is there a
purchaseable, questable or craftable indestructible fishing pole?

Thanks,
