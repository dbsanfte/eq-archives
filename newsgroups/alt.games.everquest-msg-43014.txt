Halfling or Wood Elf, there's not a huge difference. I am not going to make a
new halfling druid for 5 points of WIS, even if it would be fun to run around
with my L31 gear on a newbie character :P I might change from a half elf to a
wood elf or halfling though, given that I am very close to hitting 200 WIS
(anything more is a big waste of pp except in the ability to swap in a
special-purpose piece of gear for its right-click ability or to pump your magic
resistence for fighting necros or other mobs that take over your character). The
difference is worth the few weeks it would take to powerlevel a new, highly
twinked character to L30.
