Based on the information people have contributed (thanks!), various
trends that folks have noticed, and my own research, here's what seems
to be the case.

Spells of the same level have the same trivial point, regardless of
class. (Nullify Magic for enchanters seems to be the only anomaly
mentioned.)

I'll leave the trivial points of restoring faded pages to an
enchanter.

Some of these are estimates, but they should be pretty darned close.
If anyone has any data that contradicts this, please share:

Spell Research Trivials:
Level 16 Spells - Trivial at 26.
Level 20 Spells - Trivial at 46.
Level 24 Spells - Trivial at 71.
Level 29 Spells - Trivial at 96.
Level 34 Spells - Trivial at 120.
Level 39 Spells - Trivial at 140.
Level 44 Spells - Trivial at 166.
Level 49 Spells - Trivial at 184.
