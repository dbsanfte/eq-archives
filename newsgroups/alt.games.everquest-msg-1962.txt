I had friends who could positively rock Defender and Robotron.
As much as I loved those games, I never could get *good* at them.
Defender was always camped with a waiting list (heh) at my local
arcade, too.

The only arcade game I got "uber" at was one called Hyper Sports.
One of the events was Archery, where you shot eight arrows at a
moving target. Once, I sunk all eight into the bullseye. Man, was
I pissed when the arcade finally rebooted the machine and erased
my high score on that event.
