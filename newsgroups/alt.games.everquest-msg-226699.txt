I have a Radeon card also.  There is a known problem with some of these
cards and the 3d target ring.

This thread may help you.  If not, it is a place for you to submit your card
info so SOE can work towards a solution.

The first post links the original thread, be sure to try all the suggestions
there before posting to this thread.

Hope this helps, I also cannot see the ring on one of my computers.
