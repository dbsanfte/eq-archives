}I just recently found out about Luclins airless zones the very hard
}way. =(
}Is it possible to get a res in this zone?

Yes, just like any other zone.

}I mean, I don't have any EB items, but I do have EB spell.  Res
}effects wipes out all your buffs, if I remember correctly.  So... what
}happens?

If you have EB cast on you before the rez, yes, it will go foop.

}If you get a res, you start with 1HP and wouldn't you just die
}instantly again?

No, you start with about 20% HP and NO mana.  You have some options.  

Get an EB item.  A charged one would be fine.  The moss mask or 
vial of egg whites off the froglok idealst in upper guk may be obtainable 
naked, depending.  Or you could loot your corpse (but not all the way!) 
first.  That takes time though.  There is a shaman made Aquatic haunting 
potion, or a potion called Fish Gill Extract supposedly sold by vendors.

Get the rez, and target yourself and use the item the instant you land.  
Alternately, any cleric going to the grey may have someone along who can 
cast EB or Dead Man Floating on you as soon as you're rezzed.  Especially 
if you donate more.  One more possibility:  EB yourself and drag your 
corpse to the zoneline (make sure you -haven't- looted it!)  Then get 
rezzed and zone.  When you have mana again, zone back and loot. The reason 
not to loot is that you are also rezzed with no strength, so if you're 
carrying more than a pound or so, you may be too encumbered to make it to 
the zone, even if it's 3 feet away.

By the way, airlessness is just like drowning.  A timer pops up and you 
have a certain amount of time to get back to where there's air, or get EB, 
generally oh, 30-40 seconds.  How long is supposedly a function mostly of 
stamina.
