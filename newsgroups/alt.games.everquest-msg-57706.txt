I'm suffering from way-too-many full Win2k crashes when I play EQ. 
Basically, I get a blue screen with some debugging garbage and the messages:

DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

and then more garbage and the ominous:

Beginning dump of physical memory

I'm no Windows guru, but I can just about tell it's probably a 
driver-related issue, and I tend to blame it on the SBLive! drivers. The 
problem is that, after rolling back to the original drivers off the CD, 
this is still happening (although a little bit less often than after I 
installed the latest Creative drivers).

I don't imagine there actually *is* a solution (short of going back to 
Win98), but I wanted to share it nevertheless... :(
