You could delete the world files (everfrost????.s3d) and then run a thorough
check to reinstall them.  There are 3.  Also delete the Gequip???? files.
Any of them could have been corrupted.  That *should* work.  Depending on
modem speed, the download could take about 20mins.  With DSL, it's over in 2
mins.
