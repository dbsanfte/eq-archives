The Raiders are going to win on Sunday, I can't guarantee they will go =
over the 4 point line or whatever it is, but they will win, that sounds =
like a better place to "invest" than the stock market if you ask me. I =
don't usually "gamble" but I could use some money so I'm going to ask =
God to make it rain on Sunday in the Silicon Valley so hard that a =
rainbow appears and you will have no doubts anymore.=20

Here I'm asking God to make it pour down rain on Sunday so the Oakland =
Raiders could win, I heard a calm voice say "ok".
