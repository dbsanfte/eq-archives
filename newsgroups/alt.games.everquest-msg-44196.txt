 That's assuming you are a porter/gate class or have one with you. That
does nothing to help someone zoning in looking for a group. If you know
that if you zone in you're stuck (and in the case of Chardok potentially
dead) you're more apt not to bother going there unless you already have
a group.

 A tank looking for a group that zones into Chardok may possibly be able
to make it to the zoneout. Sebilis is a little trickier unless it's
heavily camped at the time. At least Kaesora and Droga someone zoning in
can shout for a group then leave again through the same spot.
