Been ages since I played my (human) monk who I abandoned before he hit
30.  But I seem to recall reading a thread on Monkly business about the
BotB tournies, (back when I cared about those farsical wastes of time)
and they said that the majority of them were always won by leezards. Or
am I remembering incorrectly?

Granted, that's not the only measure of a "good monk", as in terms of
how good of a player are they, how good a puller, what gear, etc.  But
the one on one battle scenario is certainly some sort of measure for it.

I thought the leezards had some inate advantages over an equally
equipped monk beyond just being able to swim better?
