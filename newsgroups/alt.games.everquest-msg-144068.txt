Yes, your int/wis will be checked... Str works as a backup and wil be
checked second.

Wisdom will count, agility is never checked by any tradeskill

For tradeskills, generally, the only stats that matter are Int and Wis
(whichever is higher)

For smithing... because Tanks want armour, but are as dumb as rocks...
strength was added as a second check, but only for smithing.

For Fletching, dexterity was added as the second check... because archers
usually have high dex (because high dex improves archery hits).

Tailoring might use Dexterity as well, but untill EQTraders.com comes back
online, I can't check to be certain. :o)
