Hey all!

Really enjoying my lvl 23 Iksar SK. Got 6 pieces of Dreadscale Armor and
ready to visit the world! My lvl 24 human Monk pal and I hopped the boat in
OT and sailed to Oasis. We bought binds in EFP and headed to The Warrens
(just to check it out). Got a TP to Toxx, saw the Warrens (think Blackburrow
with Kobolds) and decided to go elsewhere. Invised through Erudin, hopped
the boat and Invised through Qeynos. Ran to EK, throught the Gorge and
Runnyeye into Misty where I got a tad close to Zorro Jr. and had my tail
handed to me.

As you can see I know to be careful, but what I'd like to see is a list of
non-kunark people and places where I'm not KoS.

For instance:

Shady merchant in EC tunnel is indiff.
Barb merchant in WK is indiff (supposedly - didn't try it)

How about the underground SK guild in Qeynos?

Tried the websites, but even after a year Iksar strategy guides are
elusive..

Thanks!

Skayle (aka Drywit)
