I helped a buddy to get his cloak one day and he popped about every hour or
so on a random timer took like 6 hours to get it because he only drops cloak
about every 5th time.  Another time we camped the zone for like 4 hours with
no popped had most of our guild in there with track up constantly with no
pop.
