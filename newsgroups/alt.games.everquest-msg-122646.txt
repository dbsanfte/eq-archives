Warriors can take dammage well, wizards can not.  Why should they be expected to
have the same dammage our put over time, but the wizard is not helping the party in
taking dammage.  It would seem reasonable to allow the wizard to do extra amount of
dammage, to offset the fact that they lack the ability to receive dammage.  The way
the game works, not only can wizards no keep up with constant fights in dammage
output.

Example

Hunting bloodgills in LOIO, a lvl 49 monk and a lvl 48 wizard, the Monk armed with
a Wu stick and hand with a 880 AC hardly what you would call twinked.  The monk
would pull and split the pairs, take and heal 100% of the dammage, with binding
wounds or mend.
The Wizard would cast one conflagration spell, and if not resisted doing 620 or so,
Bloodgills have about 1300-1400 hits, so not quite 1/2 dammage to the target, with
particle or full resists the wizard would have to cast 1.2 spells per mob to do the
average 600 points per mob.  We would do the top 8 around the dome and after that
the wizard would have to med up.

This is why I feel wizards are broken, my example, while only one and I will be
willing to give more, demonstrates that wizards as currently configured cannot hold
there own in a group, and they actually slow the group down.   The monk is taking
and healing 100% of the dammage, while the wizard is taking none, the wizard is not
dealing 1/2 the dammage.

Don't get me wrong, I am not a wizard hater, I play one that is why I believe
wizards, like all casters are broken, wizards however has it the worst because they
only do dammage and rely solely on spells for there dammage.


Second I have nothing wrong with any of the classes with the ability to solo.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the
gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise
and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that
nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your
gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
