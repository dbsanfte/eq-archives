Never assume anything.  We were in a level 52 - 62 group yesterday.  When we
were done the wizard ported us to Knowledge.  Great.  Everyone knows Knowledge.
 Right?  Wrong.  The ML was a troll,  he gated to trollville to sell, (ok,
maybe that was necessary... whatever.  Anyone know why he would do that?  I
don't play a troll).  Then when he came back he couldn't figure out where the
Nexus book was.
