Yes, but the benefits are much less for, say, Wizards.  In the pure melee
case, the downtime is caused by the mob's damage output, which goes down
because of the faster grouped kill.  The Warriors get a 1/6 factor from
sharing the damage taken, and a 1/6 factor from the mob only lasting 1/6th
as long.

In the case of, say, 6 Wizards, the downtime is from mana consumption.  The
Wizards get a 1/6 from sharing the nuking, but don't get anything for the
mob only living 1/6th as long.
