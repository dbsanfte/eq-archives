It used to be the group that had the *individual* who did the most damage
got the xp.  This was what enabled one person to KS a whole group.  They
changed this to be the group aggregate damage (why it wasn't like that in
the first place is anyone's guess).

But the killshot *never* determined the XP (unless it was in beta, but I
doubt that, since that's even dumber than the way it used to be).
