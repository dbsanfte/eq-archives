I always thought that druids have a huge public relations problem.
There's such a large percentage of them that solo'd to high levels
that inviting an unknown druid into a pickup group is a pretty big
unknown. The odds of you getting one that just doesn't know his stuff
in a grou is, in my experience, a lot bigger with a druid than a
shaman or cleric. If I'm forming a group, I'll gladly take a druid
that I know as primary healer to go with my shaman. I'd be very, very
hesitant to do the same with an unknown druid LFG and would probably
hold out for a cleric. Even if he's an idiot, at least he can rez us
afterwards <g>.
