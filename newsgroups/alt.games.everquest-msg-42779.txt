    My gear, as a level 60 cleric, is much worse. If I cannibalized my seven
other characters I'd have exquisite gear, but I derive enough joy from
playing them that I'd never do it. I'm wearing five items I bought at level
26 - SSB, CGS, Ad Eps, two Bracers of the Reverent. So you're doing just
fine for a main character, without having camped cash.

    Unlikely. ;-) But I will let you in on a secret - at your level, you
could fight in any of the spider camps in Velk's and not embarass yourself
as long as you weren't main tank/puller. And arms like this drop as a random
rare drop there off Crystalline Hunters: Crystal Chitin Armplates - AC 18
STR 5 STA 5 HP 10. You should read up on Velk's, as a ton of quality tank
gear can drop in Spiders, as well as the gems you'll need for Velious quest
armour. Other than going to Hate for your Indicolite (which you should start
thinking about now), that's the best you'll get as a drop. I'll not mention
Indi from here on in, but read up on it - awesome stats.

>Buy -

    Price out what Cobalt Arms sell for on your server. They're common
enough, especially with the older warriors upgrading to Velious quest
armour. Price might still be high from all the non-essential classes making
WAR alts, though.

    If I had both, I'd wear the Ice Bear over the Lizardscale. Armour is for
protection, and Ice Bear is better overall protection.

>Chest
>Have - Crafted Breastplate: +22 AC, +5 Sta, +25
>Hunt - Tree Weave +25 AC, +10 Str, Forest Giant Ancient, Burning Wood
>Buy -

    I'm not certain that gaining 3 AC is worth losing all the HPs from
Crafted, but that's me. An easier upgrade from Lower Guk which you could
hunt/buy is the Enamelled Black Chestplate, AC 25. Should be less than 1 K,
can be camped at your level, and doesn't make you look like a moron like the
Tree Weave does.

>Ear
>Have - Cougar Claw Earrings (2) +4 AC, +3 Str, +2 Dex
>Hunt - None
>Buy - None

    If you need cash, consider downgrading these to Orc Fangs. Orc Fangs
could be picked up fast in EW, and losing 1 AC 2 DEX for 15 HPs is pretty
much a wash in my mind.

>Face
>Have - Woven Frost Giant Beard +5 AC, +4 vsCold, (Save for resists)
>Hunt - +6 AC, +2 Agi, +2 Dex, +10 HP
>Buy - Fine Plate Visor: +7 AC

    For reference, I belive the mask quest requires mammoth meat from the
mammoths in EW.

>Feet
>Have - Banded Boots: +6 AC
>Hunt - Crafted Plate Boots: +12 AC, +5 Agi (Permafrost quest item)
>Buy - None

    Yeah, this is bad. Crafted Boots ASAP, and at least try and get some
bronze boots in the meantime. Ogre Captain in Najena always drops a piece of
Large Bronze when killed, and the Greater Icebone Skeletons in Lower Guk
also drop Large Bronze. Might also consider buying Fine Steel Plate boots -
they'll cost about 100 pp (most smiths of FS charge in the 10 pp per AC
range).

>Finger
>Have - Jagged Band (x2) +5 AC, +3 Str
>Hunt - None
>Buy - ????  Platinum Fire Wedding Ring: +5 AC, +55 HP (Don't really know
>that this is an improvement.)

    It is. Remember, you just exist to be hit. Anything that lets you get
hit more before Tiru CHeals you is good. And don't settle for Plat Fire, go
for Velium Fire Wedding Rings - AC 6 HP 65 each.

>Shoulder
>Have - Blood Stained Mantle +6 AC, +3 Str, +10 Sv Mgc (save for resist
>gear)
>Hunt - Crafted Pauldrons  +12 AC, +2 Str, +2 Sv Mgc
>Buy - Nothing particular

    Consider buying a Tattered Mantle - AC 12 HP 20 Sv. Disease 10. Again, a
ton of protection. You can also go hunt this, as the mob that drops it
always has one (Gullerback in BW), but you'd need a good group - he can be
50 plus.

    Good luck, and can you tell I enjoy shopping in EQ? ;-)
