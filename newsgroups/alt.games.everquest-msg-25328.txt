That's why everyone should use =) instead of :) in EQ.

I wish they would fix that. EQ chat also tends to drop the "-" sign.
Which makes giving your location a pain in the ass because -1834, -1723
comes across as 1834, 1723 to the other person. Which is very bad since
that is the opposite side of the zone from where the intended location
actually is. This is why everyone gives loc requests like neg1834, neg1723
