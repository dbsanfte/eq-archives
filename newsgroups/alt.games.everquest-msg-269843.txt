Something I learned today:

== Your exp debt will go away with time when you are logged off. The longer
you stay logged off, the more debt will dissipate. Preliminary reports are
that debt disappears at approximately 1/2 percent per hour. ==

So you could stay logged off for 280 hours (11.7 days) and all your debt
will be gone.  Quite a bit of time but hey, if you are playing more than one
MMORPG, you can play the other one while you get rid of the debt.

Here's the link I found the information on.  There's a lot more tips.
