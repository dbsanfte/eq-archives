"Go out"?  Go where?  I'm not a partying teen and never was when I was that
age (somehow many people think that once you hit puberty your maturity level
stops increasing and doesn't start again until LV30).  Do what?  I don't do
drugs, don't drink, never have and don't want to.  And assuming you could
find people in their low 20s age range, who understand (and follow the
practice) that there is more to life than drunk, druggy, party your life
away, get deaf from your stereo, shove bolts and other objects through
unnatural holes in your face, color your hair to colors that don't exist in
nature, then how do I get there?  I can't drive, and people tend to not like
always being the one to have to come get you (and the offering gas money
doesn't work...its more of a taking the time factor as well...some people
still will, but many soon stop).  Try dating?  Problem is all of the above
mentioned issues (immature girls LV18-22, 23, just out of high
school/college age), along with the somewhat mature ones who only care about
the car or motorcycle you've got (can't drive), so not that one.  Then the
problems of boyfriend/girlfriend stuff.  I saw it when I was younger,
decided it was too much trouble, watched as I got older, the trouble only
increased (sure when you get older, about LV12 or so, and puberty strikes,
there are now added rewards...but the troubles still outweigh them).  I've
got/had many friends who are female, and we've not had problems, and all of
them tell/warn me not to get a girlfriend because that type of relationship
is not worth the trouble it causes.  Then marriage? First see all above
issues, then add to that the fact that you've just signed over everything
you own.  Walk in with little or nothing, walk out with half of everything
(even a few months later).  In a world where divorce is nearly as common as
marriage, staying single just gives you the end result anyway, minus allot
of costs and problems.
    (OK, now to get back on-topic).  My point is that EQ has given me more
of a social life, allowed me to interact with people where I'd be far less
likely to be able to in real life, and I enjoy it more.  My main
communication with others has been online, at one point in my life, due to
certain living/life situations, I had to rely 100% on the Internet as my
communication source and only way to keep contact with others, even family.
I know someone who for certain other reasons (not involving him, but
involving others around him) I can not spend time with in person (other than
during work when we worked at the same place for the 4 months he was there),
but we group in EQ about once a week.
    My point is that the Internet and EQ ARE my life.  Sure there are other
parts, but I can't have that all the time or on a at will basis like I can
with EQ.  EQ is at times my survival, preventing me from becoming one of
those people who doesn't go outside much.  I get outside to walk 3/4 mile to
work, and to ride my bicycle about 1/4-3/8 miles to the store about once
every 2-3 weeks, and then depositing my paychecks in the bank about every
4-6 weeks (kind of funny to see their look when you are depositing the past
1.5-2 months income at once) but that's mainly due to my bank being about
1.5-2 miles away.
    By the way, if you can't already tell, I'm definitely for the
advancement in technology, and rely on broadband (mainly due to it's always
on connection, though the bandwidth does help).  I even built a $2,000
computer system for my sister (printer and scanner included...and DEFINITELY
a surge protection/backup power supply also...already spent allot on the
computer and accessories, why not spend a little more on some good
protection as well?), well, she did go ahead and give me $100 for it, plus
she needed it for college anyway.
