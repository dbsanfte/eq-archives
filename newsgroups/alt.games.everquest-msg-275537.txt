Hi all,

I am having enormous trouble downloading the latest patch for eq2. The 
updating program runs and then starts downloading a big file (can't remember 
the name). It makes a little bit of progress and then freezes and eventually 
I get the message that says "download cancelled". Anyone else having this 
problem? Are there any sites where I can directly download the patch from 
and then install it manually?

Thanks
