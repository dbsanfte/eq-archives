Ditto, in fact with @home I just have an ISA ethernet card since I was
running low on PCI slots. The cable guy who installed it said the
difference in speed at the ethernet card point would be minimal and
moot and both would work about the same. He seems to have been right.
I'm fast as hell and still get up to 450 k a sec sometimes.

I use the 3com ISA 3905 or whatever the heck it is general workhorse
card.  Ah found it, 
3com isa etherlink III 3C509B TPO in PNP mode. 

it was detected right away was you said.
It works great under suse linux 7.2 also in multiboot on the cable
connection also (though no matter what I do I can't seem to get DHCP
to work so I still have a net connection in linux (though it says it
works) so in linux I have it set up for static IP with DNS and such)

I'd go with USB being the problem also.

Old post cut about USB connection to puter instead of ethernet card
for @home cable modem service and how it did not work well.
