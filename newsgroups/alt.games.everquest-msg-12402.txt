Yes it's playable but... not quite the way you are used to playing the game
is all...

It takes a different mind set than the vast majority of those who play
today -- you check and double check everything, search, ask, etc... all in
the game and the pass the info around.  That's where most of the stuff comes
from you read about on the net -- someone researched it through trial and
error to discover what works and what doesn't.

Players find the stuff out and then others use their information.  Some
folks get a kick out of being the one who can figure it out first.  Some
from figuring out new ways to apply the base info and still others out of
sifting through it to pick out just what they are interested in within the
game.

It all depends on what  you're into.  Explorers find paths in a wilderness.
Travelers build these paths into roads.  Later still others follow the roads
at higher speeds than those who went before them.  Which group do you want
to fit into?  Your option -- none are better nor worse than the others.
Just different.

Then again, that's just my opinion <grin>
