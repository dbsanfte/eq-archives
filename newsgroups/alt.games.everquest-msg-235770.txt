Personally, I'm in the camp where I can never figure out what Verant is
thinking.  I don't know the market values on every item, hell I hardly know
what my weighty polearm should be worth.  If I had sold stuff, in an
obviously bugged system, as you say, I really wouldn't have known that it
was bugged (at least, I'm assuming, I haven't tried tribute yet).  To me,
SoE picking this way of dealing with things is like me selling you my truck
for 10K, and then stealing another 4K from you while you sleep... because I
really should have charged that much in the first place.

Those were the tribute prices SoE offered, those are the prices people made
decisions based on.  SoE screwed the pooch here, and they want to shift the
burden onto the players.

That's just how I see it, though.  Take it as you will.
