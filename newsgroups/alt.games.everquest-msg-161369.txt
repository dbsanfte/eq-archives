Just keep emailing them back with the responses they give you saying you
have done it.  Don't give up on them eventually you "MAY" get some useful
ideas.  I only offer this suggestion because I have almost an identical
setup to you and have similar problems.  Usually it is because I am sharing
out my Internet connection to another computer though.> Any ideas or help
would be greatly appreciated because even as much of a

How is your cable modem connected, USB or straight ethernet?  I go through
the USB so i don't have to use 2 NIC's to share it out...

you might try going into your commnad prompt and ipconfig /release before
you connect to the game just to make sure everthing is fresh but i don't
think that will help, but a suggestion is a suggestion...
