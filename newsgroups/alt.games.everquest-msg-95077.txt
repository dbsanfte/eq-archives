You are not the only one with that perspective.  Lately, when I play my
unguilded 50 druid or 34 cleric, I seem to always get an invite every other
day or so...not from someone I'm grouped with, but in tell form.  Sometimes
even someone I'm grouped with for the first time, but in the first 5 minutes
of grouping.  Hard to not figure out they are "likely" just looking for a
druid for free transportation, or a cleric for future free rezzes.  Of
course, I could just be extremely paranoid, but I have been in one group too
many, where we are doing great and all of a sudden one of the group members
will say, with no initial warning "sorry, have to go, guild
business"...followed by _______ has left the group.  At least unguilded, I
don't have to let down a party that invited me and I accepted in the
interest of "guild business".  I also don't think much of guilds that do
that to their members.  Lucky for me I have a couple lvl 60 friends I made
at the beginning of EQ that help me out now and then with some of the higher
end equipment, but it does kind of suck I've never been to the planes =) ...
then again, my planes ready character is a druid and we ALL know the rest of
THAT story....hehe....see you all in game =).

Alexa 50 druid

Boomith 14 Warrior
All proud residents of that society known a Drinalian!
