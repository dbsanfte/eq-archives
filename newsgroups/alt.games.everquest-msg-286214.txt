Your home city almost certainly WAS Cabilis.  However, when Serpent's
Spine was release, it became possible for ALL races to start in the
new city of Crescent Reach.  And then there was a bug that caused many
existing characters to have their home cities CHANGED to Crescent Reach.
(This was particularly distressing when it happened to a character on an
account that had not yet purchased the expansion!)

You can check if this is what happened to you by logging off your
character for at least six hours, and then using the "Return Home"
button on the character selection screen, to see where it sends you.
If your home city was indeed changed, you can then decide whether
you want to leave it that way, or petition to have it changed back.

One of my characters had this problem and when I petitioned I had a
GM contact me within minutes to straighten it out.  Basically he did
something to tell the game that I had not yet selected a starting city,
and then I was able to select either Crescent Reach or Rivervale (as a
halfling, obviously).
