It's an OPTIONAL method of decreasing downtime, not available for FREE
to everyone. Meditate, however, is a skill that every caster gets for
free and MASSIVELY reduces downtime. If you want to reduce downtime
required to recover HP, then (perish the thought!) group with a
cleric.

Here's another thought....Beastlords have healing spells, as wimpy as
they may be...however, I would wager that healing one's self then
medding back the mana used would keep pace, if not surpass, the Fungi
Tunic. You *DO* know to use Inner Fire for healing until you get your
second healing spell, right?
