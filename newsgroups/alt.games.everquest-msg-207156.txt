No, his facts are not meaningless.
True, when EQ came out no one on the team had ever worked on a
mmorpg because it was the first of its kind, so there was no way any
one could have been hired that had worked on one. But now, a few years
and many mmorpgs later (good or bad) you can hire people that have
worked on games like that. Now, whether or not Blizzard has hired any
people that have worked on mmorpgs  is a different story, and I would
hope they have.
