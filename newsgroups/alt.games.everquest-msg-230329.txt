Well, funny thing about guides - they tend to not be as knowledgable
as a long time player since they spend time guiding when other people
are playing.

Also the guide lifestyle tends not to pander to those who play the
most.

Add it up and your typical long term player generally knows
considerably more about the game than your typical guide.
