I was Bad and did a quick check on magelo...without gear and AAs it
appears that bard and ranger HP are roughly even at 65.  Now...what I
don't know is if bards get 6hp/stamina like melees do, or if they are on a
lower table.

bard hp at 65: 1738
foxeye's hp at 65: 1756

Could be worse.

FYi, rangers are up to 240 defense now (yay!), but clearly bards are not
suffering in this skill at least
