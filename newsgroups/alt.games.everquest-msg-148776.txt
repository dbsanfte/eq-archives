Grr I don't seem to write very well.  I'm not saying it exists in-game 
I'm just saying that I don't see a way for anybody to *completely make 
the item up* and pretend it's an EQ item.  I know it's probably just 
something they fiddled around with and won't ever put in.  I'd be 
shocked if it actually did show up.

Well, and switching to a PvP server.
