Velious caters for the 30+ crowd, and was marketed as such. Luclin has 
starting locations for a new player race (Vah Shir) and so has newbie zones 
and so on - there are places to level from 1 right up to 60 there. Yes, 
horses are expensive, but they were added partly as a way to get some of 
that old money out of the economy. The cheapest horses are only about 8k 
with good charisma and faction, certainly the same sort of ballpark as tink 
bags and tboots.

You've just headed the wrong way out of the bazaar. For example, you could 
head from Shadowhaven to Paludal Caverns (a teens-level zone, which your 
ranger could camo his way through if its too tough for him) to 
Shadeweaver's Thicket, the Vah Shir newbie zone (level 3 or 4 to mid 30s or 
so), through Shar Vahl to Hollowshade Moor (low teens to 30s or so).

Another way out of the Nexus is through Netherbian Lair (20s or so) to 
Dawnshroud Peaks (30 to 50), which is a great zone for a ranger to solo, 
full of animals to fear kite.

It sounds like you've just wandered into Fungus Grove or somewhere and run 
away screaming...

Oh, and noone is coming to sell in the bazaar, because they haven't 
implemented it yet - you're supposed to be able to go afk and become an NPC 
vendor or somesuch - these features are coded, but not integrated into the 
UI until they release the promised huge UI upgrade (which won't be until 
they've ironed out most of the bugs in Luclin).
