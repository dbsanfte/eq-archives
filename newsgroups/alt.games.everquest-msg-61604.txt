I would try their email, or online support first.  I have never had to use
their tech support, so I have no direct experience with it.  As to the long
distance, sounds like you need a new carrier, I'm paying 4.9 cents per
minute, no fee, no limitations on time, so two hours works out to $5.88,
that's usually my monthly long distance bill.  I was actually serious about
using their tech support, I have heard mostly good things about it from
friends that have used it.

I saw in a different thread you were asking about upgrading your computers.
I use a GeForce2 MX400 AGP with 64MB of ram, works very well, sells for $100
or so, works very well with DX8 using the latest NVidia drivers.  If you
have an AGP slot, then go with that, if not, I'm not sure if there is a PCI
version of the card or not.  I am using Win2k, not 98se, so I can't say it
will do the same for you.  You will have no choice about upgrading to DX8
with SoL, it is required, I would recommend getting ready for it now, so you
have the bugs worked out.  You should also upgrade your ram on your wife's
system to at least 256MB.  As for your system, if you really are stuck with
IBM memory at their prices, then you would be far better off replacing the
box in the long run.  If you have a friend that is comfortable with moving
parts from your old system to your new system, then you can get a decent
setup for the same or less than the IBM memory.
