I have this same problem but it's not related to switching to another
server.  If I /camp and re-enter with another character, I get that black
screen every time.  Eventually, I'm able to control-alt-del to get a task
manager up.  When that happens I see that the everquest.exe (or whatever
it's called) is using 100% CPU and memory usage is no-where near my limit (I
have lots of the new SOL stuff disabled because I only have 256MB of
memory).

I believe this bug has already been mentioned on the everquestlive
developers forum so they are aware of it.
