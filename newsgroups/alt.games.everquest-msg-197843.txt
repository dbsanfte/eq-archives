Nope. Didn't ignore it at all. It makes sense how a seperation can occur 
there. I just don't believe that it's so terrible that it should split up 
a guild. Read on...

So why would they be in such a rush to pass the trials?

Seems to me the player in their 50's has those very same choices, knowing 
that one day, they will be better capable of tackling the trials.

It sounds to me that what you would like to see is a more trivial trip 
from 55 to 65. I say it should be a bigger deal than that.
