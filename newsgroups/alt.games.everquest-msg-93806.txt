You can't kick and ID at the same time though.

ID is a very slow skill to raise, and you get it after FD by training it

Fighting baton or EoD are both very cheap weapons

I was lazy with my character, I had 2 fighting batons to start with, and by
the time I was in my 40's had almost zero in h2h and 2hb, what I did during
these levels (exping in groups in DL) would drop 1 baton, and use baton/fist
combo.  Within a day or 2 my hands were maxed.

To raise 2hb I waited till I was factioning in Velious, then topped it off
by using 2hb on raids

We get a disc - silentfist I think its called... tho to be honest its a
total pos (its level 59 too) it also uses one of the lower level special
attacks (just like ashen - another total pos)
