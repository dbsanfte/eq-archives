Very, VERY much easier to go that way.  From Riverfale, follow path 
straight until you come to the wall.  Then go up and a bit to the left - 
the entrance to Runnyeye is in between the gob camps there.  At level 19, 
none of those will aggro on you (except MAYBE that caster one? never seen 
him yet, but if he does, he's a wuss anyway).  Once you zone into 
Runnyeye, follow the right wall until you zone out.  Once you zone into 
the Gorge, follow the *left* wall until you zone out.  Then you're in the 
Karanas.  Turn right, and if you're worried about running into nasties, 
this is what I've been doing since level 9: follow right wall until you 
see the druid rings, then turn left and cross the wood bridge right in 
front of you (watch out for the mean guy at the water's edge - forget his 
name, but he's apparently an undercon).  Once you zone in, follow the 
water to your left.  For a very, VERY long time.  Go past the stone 
bridge.  You'll zone into West Karanas and you just keep running till you 
hit the Barbarian village - there's a wall just after that, turn right, 
follow the wall, you'll hit Qeynos Hills.  Follow the path, turn left 
when you hit a cross-path and - you're in Qeynos.  Welcome to the very 
edge of society.  Visit the docks!  See a real live bat outside the 
castle!
