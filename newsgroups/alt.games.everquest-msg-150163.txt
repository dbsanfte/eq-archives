	It's common knowledge, though it can be surprising how many new players
don't grok it.

	If you're going to test it for yourself, make sure you use two different
types of weapons, and that you actually read your logs.  Don't look at the
graphics.  After about level 20, the graphics have nothing to do with what
your character is actually doing.
