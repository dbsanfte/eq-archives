No, I don't play a puller. As I said, my ranger is 32 and until LDoN 
solod and did main assist/add tanking.

As a cleric, however I can calibrate what i cast and when I cast by 
knowing how much you have in HP...and by seeing how your health bar 
reacts on the first few pulls [unless i group with you relatively 
frequently and know from past experience how to handle you.] If one or 2 
mobs drops you at a particular rate, i can adjust enough to know that 
the 3d mob will make me expend mana at a particular different rate, and 
that with what ever % of mana i happen to have i can say with assurance 
that if you pull that roon of however many mobs i will NOT be able to 
handle that type of damage given my resources [ranging from mana regen, 
mana buffs, mod rods, necro twitch] Oh, I am also doing this for 
everybody in the roup...all the tanks, robes, only things i dont heal 
are pets...and i will occasionally drop a remedy on a pet if it looks 
close to the end and it is getting low and my mana is ok. Saves 
summoning  and buffing/equipping a new one. Occasionally that pet can 
make a difference if it was a marginal pull.

Keeping in mind I actually dont really tend to watch the actual 
fighting, i am reading battle spam, looking at health bars, mana bars, 
my timer [mod rods...] and actually doing the spells [and it also 
includes things like the occasional yaulp 5, sitting standing and moving 
to get out of the way...] And unlike many other clerics, i will load 
stun...I have enough ac to take a thwack that will seriously dent a 
chanter...and it can attract their attention away from the robe long 
enough for someone to get agro off us noncombattants=)
