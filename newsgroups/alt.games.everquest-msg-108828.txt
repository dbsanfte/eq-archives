No  - UO had an Anarchic enviroment for a long time - EQ is a regular Garden
of Eden in comparison. Life is pretty damn close to what you see in EQ.
Organisms live, breed and multiply by preying on other organisms. If you
think your innocent then you better have a mighty severe case of chlorophyl
to back your argument up.

Every day, around the world, there are people committing acts against fellow
humans that make what we do against pixels look saintly. Where are all these
concerned consciences then? It's like listening to Femminist whine about how
bad it is that 50% of top executives are not women in Country XX whilst
ignoring the fact that in country YY females are circumised (mutilated),
sold in to slavery or murdered.

And how many Hitlers do you think were in WW2? You think that every German
Infantryman was a bloodthirsty SS officer? Every Dresden resident an
abomination? Every person consumed in the civilian nuclear attacks on Japan
evil and deserving of such a fate? For criminies sake stop worrying about a
meaningless computer games and take your rightousness out on a *real* issue.

I think you have a serious problem with your view of mentally disabled
people if you see a correlation between them and some computer pixels
programmed to act in XX way given YY conditions. Mentally disabled, or fully
"healthy" - they are all complicated, thinking beings with feelings, a
perception of the world around them and capable of the most profound love.

Hello? Ever taken a cursory glance what happens during warefare? And that is
between real people - not some database entries.

No - if you want *real* money you should go to some backward country and
bribe the corrupt politicians into selling out their countries natural
resources for a song and turning a blind eye whilst they committing
appalling atrocities against their citizens to hold power and cashflow. EQ
isn't even distasteful compared to what we find in our own "1st world
democracies".

Just like real life eh? Ever wonder how much tax a crack dealer pays? Or the

Pop quizz, whats worth more, a kilo of wheat or a kilo of crack cocaine? Who
are the richest people in real life, scientists, engineers and farmers or
pop singers, sports players and executives? Fair? Let's face it - we humans
value crap and trivialise the profound. Fact 'O Life.

Yeah - I had never heard of Ethnic cleansing before picking up a computer
game either... EQ is just a big database with pixelated representations of
imaginary beings. If you cannot disassociate that from reality, yet at the
same time not associate the images you see on TV of real bullet riddled
bodies lying on 3rd world street *with* reality, then I too see a major
problem also.
