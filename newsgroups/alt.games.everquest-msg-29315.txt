Okay, wow.  I thought I'd been around a bit until I hit 19 and picked up my
ring spells at the WC ring.  Jeesh - okay so I head off to NK ring for the
rest of my spells - theres some HUGEASS tree there - moving around - con's
red to me but judges amiably hehe - sweet!   Scary place - couple of
questions:

1.)  While I'm sitting there scribing my new spells, I keep getting messages
like "You feel dizzy", "You develop a sudden headache", stuff like that -
all the time this eerie creeking of that dang treant going on and I can hear
him moving about - is that related to it?  or what was that all about?  I
wasn't taking any damage that I could tell....weird

2.)  The standard what to hunt now thing? - level 19 halfling druid with
*all* spells so far - the zoneline at Oasis has been good but I want to
explore - travel to distant places and decimate new things as a good druid
should...

3.)  I get conflicting info from the top websites on the spells upgrades -
at this point as a newbie 19 and new to say dizzying wind and careless
lightning - which take a TON more mana than my cascade of hail and ignite
I've been using up til now - what should I be using?  Some sites say that
until maybe 20 you'll suck too bad at those spells or the mana cost is too
much at 19 - others suggest upgrading and hunting immediately with them.

4.)  I do want a surname at 20, and never thought of it alot until this last
weekend.  I named my guy Haffas - only slightly modified from a
machine-picked name.  Honestly, my intention was indeed a play on 'half-ass'
but I don't want to follow it up with the commonly suggested 'Backwards'.
He's just a little halfling guy but I don't want something like
'Binkythorpe'.

Once again, any help much appreciated.
