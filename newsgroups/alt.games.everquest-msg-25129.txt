    On my server, the top three guilds are quite stratified - the best one
is the only one that does Sleeper's (they take every first brood spawn to
ensure it), the second best one is the only one in PoM, and the third one
cleans up the "lesser" boss mobs on patch day. All of them are on a frantic
raid schedule, to the point where members complain a lot in open forums
about not being able to get to 60. The results?

    They used to have a problem with people leaving a guild to "hop" to the
next highest guild. No more. They only meet other guilds when they fight
over a spawn. No time to recruit. The ones that can't stand being level X
and not advancing burn out and quit EQ rather than defect - which is better
in the high-competition environment. When someone DOES quit, a replacement
is snapped up from the lesser guilds quite quickly. It's almost to the point
of random tells - as an unguilded 58 cleric, I've got more than a few
"hello, friend!" tells from people in all three of them that I haven't
grouped with since Sol B or High Keep. And because they ARE the only way to
see high-end content, people defect to them.

    Would *I* want to run a guild like a taskmaster? Hell, no. EQ is about
relaxing and having fun. I've often said the day someone tells me what I
WILL be doing that day after I get home from work is the day I /guildremove.
But I also recognize what strong guilds do. They raid like demons to get the
No Drop gear they need to kill the next challenge up on the rung. They just
don't allow folks to deviate from the goal. Look at the AL guild
requirements - "If you can't be on for this many hours, don't bother
applying." If Jakugg wants to keep his guild together through to level 60,
he has to keep people who want to see the top-level content from leaving.

    What one of the guilds on our server does is "XP raids" - things like
two-group raids to the basement of Karnor's. Mostly these are for XP,
although they also get some named loot and the odd quest (VP key piece off
Verix) piece. But again, they stay together always, and always have a "big
picture" goal that can be met on the raid.
