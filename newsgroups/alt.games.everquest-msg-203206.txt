The classic stalker ploy .. accused the stalked of being the stalker.

All you have to do is one thing (gee, doesn't this sound familiar?).  You
didn't do it yesterday.  You never crossed the line.  Now I'll make it easy,
seeing as how you've allegedly cancelled your account.  I'll tell you what I
was looking for.

Let someone else have the last word.

It's easy.  Just don't respond to this post.

My bet is that you can't do it.

But try ... try really, really hard.
