This is so hard to define.  When I was level 9, I considered the level 20 
bard who helped get my corpse out from Kithicor Forest at night to be 
"uber".  I once had a level 50 shaman challenge me to a duel for 
"kill-stealing" a decaying skeleton from him.  That was "uber" too.

Perhaps my recent guildless experience, though, showed the real difference 
between "uber" and "non-uber", at least from my perspective.  For a month I 
was without a guild, so I depended on pick-up groups for XP.  A couple of 
times I got questions along the lines of "How much mana do you have 
unbuffed?"  My answer (8500 at the time) was good enough to meet someone's 
criteria of "uber".  I was allowed to do some MPG single-group trials and to 
XP in RSS because I had the equipment to give me a significant mana pool.

I once joined an RSS group and was asked, "Do you have Bali?  The last 
cleric didn't have Bali."  I didn't have Symbol of Balikor either; I needed 
two Glowing Runes or six Minor Runes to get that spell.  This clearly 
disappointed the group.  I wasn't "uber" to them.

A mage started regularly inviting me into his MPG / RSS groups.  When I 
joined my current guild, I started participating in raids and after-raid 
activities, and now I had to reply to his tells that I was busy doing other 
things.  I regret that terribly, because he was a good source of finding 
groups when I was guildless, but now I had so much to do with my current 
guild I just couldn't find time to group with him.

When I was interviewed by my current guild, I was quizzed about my AA's - I 
"only" had 300.  I was told a condition of my trial is that I get a lot more 
AA's.  In the past month I've added nearly 100 AA's, and even then I'm on 
the lower end of guild AA's.  Another cleric in the guild recently dinged 
his 900th AA.

So, what is uber?

Equipment, with good focus effects and stats.  Time gear seems to be the 
current minimum, with all slots have 100hp/mana at worst.  With that 
equipment, you can cast more spells, attack more proficiently, withstand 
more damage.

Lots of AA's, which also adds to your mana/hp/mitigation/DPS.  A tank with 
Time gear and 500 AA will be a lot better than a tank with Anguish gear and 
50 AA.  Plus there are certain AA spell-like abilities that can do awesome 
things - I can't imagine what it's like being a cleric without DivArb 
anymore.  Or RC6.   Or... well, lots of things.

Spells and/or disciplines.  There's a huge difference between the level 65 
buffs and the level 66-70 buffs.  If you can't get runes to get the latest 
spells/discs, you're not offering what a "uber" character could.

And, finally, the ability to effortlessly find good groups.  With my current 
guild, there's never a time I can't find a group if I want it.  And because 
everyone in the group is "uber", we kill stuff quickly and efficiently, 
garnering us XP and loot at an alarming rate.  This also has an unfortunate 
insulating effect; why take a chance on grouping with "non-ubers" when your 
own "uber" guildmates are close at hand?  Why choose to XP at a slower rate 
with greater risk?

Equipment.  AA's.  Spells/Discs.  Good groups.  I think those define "uber" 
in EQ.  I also think that anyone who is sufficiently motivated can become 
"uber" if they choose to devote the time to it.  Whether you want to be 
"uber" or "casual" is entirely up to you, and part of what makes EQ a great 
game, IMO - it caters to either option.
