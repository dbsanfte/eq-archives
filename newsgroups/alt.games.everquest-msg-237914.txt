Not being a smartass - If you are lonely, then why not try a dating service?
At least if you pick a reputable one the field is canvassed more than EQ.
People can be/do almost whatever they want in EQ, although eventually their
true nature does show.  Having been a witness to an online relationship (or
two) it can be easy to fall into the trap (all the characters look good/trim
etc *a couple excluded*).

As for your other comments which imply people are taking her side, I would
think that it takes two to play the game, and although you may have been
naive about it you still bear some of the responsibility for it.

Life is what you make of it, not what others make for you....
