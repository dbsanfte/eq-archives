The questions are either pertinent or not. Their
source is immaterial, as is the spelling.

If I want to get my car fixed, I ask someone who
has grease on their hands, if I want to find a
criticism of the Wiccan rede, then an anti-Wiccan
site would be the place to look, wouldn't it?

Yes, there is hyperbole there, but I thought you
might have seen through that to the underlying
principles.

The question "who defines harm" is pertinent don't
you think?

It is mostly an evangelical religion. Its what
Christians do.

The paradox of the rede is that it is impossible
to go about your life WITHOUT doing others harm,
or by your inaction, letting harm come to others.

How should a Wiccan defend themself or others
without harming anyone?

Should they have guns or any weapons for
self-defence?

How should a Wiccan react to the charge;
"There are millions of people suffering, being
harmed, in the world, and your inaction is adding
to the problem"

The problem as I see it, is that it assigns no
responsibility to any actions, only a vague caveat
that it "should harm none" 

What happens if there is no possible course of
action that harms none?

I'm sure you can think of examples.

No. Not at all.

It comes from The Book of The Law. Hardly a title
inspiring lawlessness, is it?

> Knock yourself out. Good luck.

Its a common mistake for people that know nothing
of Thelema, to believe that Crowley's words meant
a free for all. 

"One view which one often finds in his writings,
and is accepted by most of his followers, is that
one must respect not only one's own will but the
wills of others. All the wills are magically
arranged so that there is no conflict between
them, just as (so it was believed in Crowley's
day) the stars are arranged so that they never
collide. The personal will and the will of all are
mystically joined as a whole which is also the
basis of individuality in a paradoxical way.
Collision between wills would indicate that one or
the other person was not doing their True Will."

You might want to read The Book of The Law one
day, it would definitely help with the Book of
Thoth.
