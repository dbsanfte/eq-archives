If you know how haste works, you know it has a VERY fast decay rate. You
miss even ONCE with a wurmslayer and that's 80 delay between reminding
the mob you're alive. That's a LONG time if a heal lands and taunt
hasn't recycled. I eagerly quested my wurmslayer when kunark first came
out. It looked unique, hit hard AND had AC - I *really* wanted it to
work, but try as I might, I simply couldn't hold agro as well as with
other weapons. It's for exactly this reason 2 handers aren't used by
warriors when they need to hold agro

****************************************************************
Taunt and holding agro is *THE* most important job for a warrior
****************************************************************

If you want to be a damaging class without caring about agro, you may be
more suited to a rogue, monk, etc. The damage you do is merely
supplemental to your primary task of holding the mob off everyone else.
This is true at L20, and only gets more important the higher you get


>Not ever warrior in the game is going to be taunting off a group with max
>haste primals. Its absurd to suggest they are.

The mention of high end weapons was only in comparison to other high end
weapons that aren't used for taunting because of their delay,
irrespective of ratio. I wasn't born with a silver primal in my mouth
you know. I was using Ykeshas at L49. I've gone through a wide range of
weapons to get where to what I have today, and have had access to a
whole load more. I banked my epic primary hander soon as I got it,
because unfortunately the Crescent Blades of Luclin taunted better, even
with the proc. The epic looked better on paper, but try as I might, I
couldn't reliably hold agro without a run of procs. I came to that
conclusion through extensive personal testing, and really would've
preferred to be wielding the glowing light sabre over the knuckleduster
clone


As for the damage, the numbers themselves, taken out of context
certainly look impressive. 
25 damage on this 1 hander!!!! 
Look, I just hit for over 100 again!!!. 
If you're hitting mobs with 80hp, you can look at single hits. Any more
than that and you have to look at an average damage over time, taking
into account damage bonuses and magic number theory

Using Copelands:
>50 warrior 160 str  FBSS haste
Wurmslayer 669 dpm
Lamentation 681 dpm
Jade Mace 717 dpm
Bloodpoint 692 dpm

>55 warrior 200 str  RBG haste
Wurmslayer 826 dpm
Lamentation 871 dpm
Jade Mace 914 dpm
Bloodpoint 877 dpm

This is ignoring all the SoV weapons now available in that level/price
range too.

Where did I say that?

If you are referring to:

>>Wurmslayer is, and always has been (since it became primary only), part
>>of the 'black pearl jewelery' school of warriorship. The one where they
>>teach you not to dribble so much in public, and the highest honour is a
>>doctorate in walking and chewing gum at he same time.

then you are deliberately misquoting me. This is referring to the people
who don't have a clue how the game works, and all they see is *big
numbers = good!* without understanding what is good and why.

>Geez, what is it with the superiority complexes in

You're lobotomised and have a superiority complex?

See, I can misquote out of context too );oP

Fact is, the 'school of warriorship' comments were meant to be humorous.
Clearly you took it to be a personal insult, which wasn't as I meant it.

Now stop using that Wurmslayer and use a real weapon, damnit! ):oP
