For lots of reasons, but just to illustrate one, theres just as much
endless camping in DAoC and in EQ at least you have the choice of
dozens of zones proper for your level while in DAoC you're fighting
the same stupid frogs and wolves you fought at level one, just a few
minutes down the road from your home castle.

Plus, due to the way their combat mechanics work the outcome of every
combat is known within two or three seconds of starting and no amount
of good playing or strategy will change it.

DAoC PvE is the worst of all MMORPGs.

This is the typical copout. The realms are imbalanced because the
players are better in one than the others.

It's horseshit. The realms are unbalanced because their CLASSES are
unbalanced. Of course Mythic's strategy of nerfing everything into
oblivion assures that every realm will spend time on top at some point
in DAoC's run. They have already wrecked more people's characters
through willy nilly skill and class changes than Verant did in two and
a half years.

DAoC's numbers playing continue to fail to rise. For every person who
stays past 30 nine others quit. DAoC is by far the most boring of all
the MMORPGs. For anyone who is considering it, the first twenty levels
(designed to get you through your free month) are by far the best part
of the game, after that it turns to complete shit.

Only if the only measurement is stability. Take content and balance
into consideration and it was a pukey launch that STILL isn't
corrected.

ROFL

This is 100% bullshit. There are hundreds of posts on their nazi
controlled boards complaining about its content, its depth. Quite
frankly, there IS none. At all. Whatsoever.


> area and content equal to eq when it was first released,

Very important to their fanboys to point that out. Hate to break it to
you but the times have changed. EQ, AC, and even AO have all upped
their content far beyond what DAoC *thought* was acceptable. Putting
out shit and depending on people to wait for things to get better
doesn't cut it anymore.


>a tighter and more coherent world story,

There is no story in DAoC whatsoever. None.

It's also pointless, buggy, and unbalanced. Or, put better, RvR is
broken, no ETA on it ever getting better either.

>

Which is part of the reason DAoC feels so much the same no matter
where you go, and why all its monsters look the same.


>, which is part of why it seems to take
>forever to get anywhere in eq.

In EQ it takes forever to get places because the world is huge. In
DAoC its because you walk at about turlte speed to artificially make
its puny world seem bigger.

And thats all without even mentioning other problems in DAoC, like its
absurd so-called 'dungeons' which might be the worst designed since
the random ones in AO, of which there is all of five you can go into
which support no more than 20 people tops due to their unbelievably
small size.


Nope. Daoc just ain't that great. The best thing about it was its PR
campaign which still hoodwinks people from time to time.
