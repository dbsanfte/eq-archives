They used to be, they're not anymore, although their run down shacks
remain. It was part of the changing story arc with Bertox followers
planning to raze Qeynos and build a temple to their god on its smoking
ruins, rabies plague being introduced into the local wildlife (hence the
rabid grizzlies) etc. They didn't succeed, their leader was executed and
hanged from a tree in Qeynos and the rudies and loathesomes were all
driven out. Thats the story so far - currently the plague has spread to
the Karanas and there are rumours that a gateway to the plane of decay
will be opened there. If you go to North Karana, you'll see a sickly
green glow in the sky, rabid animals, swarms of beetles and the farmers
complaining about their crops being blighted.

You can probably check out the story arc by reading stuff at the Harpy's
Head Tavern at www.station.sony.com
