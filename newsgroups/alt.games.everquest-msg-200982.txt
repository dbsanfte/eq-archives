No, it's not "splitting of hairs".  YOU equated the fact that 
inexperienced players could do something because YOU could.  But youalso 
go on to equate getting to to farm stuff to support the KEI habit.  Just 
a fucking guess, but couldn't they ALSO be farming shit so they can 
afford to purchase that uber-fucking-shit you twink your alts with?
(With "you" being collective, not personal)

Keep Kei as it is, great.  Nerf it out of existance, fine by me.  Change 
it so it only works for a certain level or above, go ahead.  I played the 
game before I knew about KEI.  I get it for my wizard when I know I'm in 
a group that can do constant pulls...IN A ZONE WHERE THERE IS VIRTUALLY 
NO ONE ELSE AROUND!  

I'm just sick of the pro-KEI for the little guy btiching that there's 
rumor it's gonna be changed and the anti-KEI for the little guy 
complaining that it's being used by someone that is only level 15.

It's obvious to me that noone is gonna change their minds on this, 
because NO ONE FUCKING WANTS TO CONSIDER THE OTHER VIEWPOINT!  From 
everything I have read in this group, the "sides" of the debate can be 
summed up as A)"It isn't fair that I had to sit and med for 10K hours and 
the newer guys don't have to"  and B) "It isn't fair that the 'elitists' 
won't let me have KEI because I'm at the wrong level"

Grow the fuck up.  Neither side in this has, so far as I know, given one 
damn bit of support for the cause the represent.  A lot of irrelevant 
side notes, a few rants, and some pure bullshit, but no support.  (Well, 
someone DID bring up the thing about high-level buffs only supposed to 
affect 45+...but that was quickly brushed aside BY EVERYONE.)

There...I'm done

And flame the fuck out of me for all I care...I'm tired of this bullshit 
thread
