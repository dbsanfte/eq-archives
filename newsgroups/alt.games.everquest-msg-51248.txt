  Hi,
         Is therre such a thing on this server as a Guild that actually
likes to hunt togather ?  I have a 50+ Necro and it seems that the only
time my guild has a use for me is on a planes raid to act as a mana battery
to help someone get there epic. And yes, I am getting a bit tired of it. Go
on raid, get no exp, get no loot, ect ,ect ct.   How about a guild wherre
the members actually hunt togather as a day to day activity? is there such a
critter? If not is anyone else interrested in starting one ?
