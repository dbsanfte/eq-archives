    I was completely unaware of that.  Thank you for letting me know.  I
trust this better?

   And replying to some of the other posts in this thread, well, yeah, I
know that my .sigs tend to get out of control.  Sooo... I have snipped out
my characters played information.  Just as well, really, I haven't logged
into EQ for 3 or 4 weeks, and if anyone really wants to look me up in CoH
they can reference me in the AGE - CoH Playerlist I have listed in the sig.

   But still, yes, my sig is still longer than the recommended 4 line
length.  13 lines with text, as I read it.  I don't buy into the whole
"Annie can do no wrong and if she does it's ok" thing.  I have bad days
like anyone else, and I know that I can wiff it with the best of them.  I
do like to think that whole "my sig is a public service thing and it can be
auto-snipped (when I don't screw that part up)" things might be considered
to be valid mitigating factors.

   If not, well, shoot... I don't _really_ want to cut anything else out. 
Is it that big of a deal?
