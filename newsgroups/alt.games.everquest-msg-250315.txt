Have recently been venturing into a few planes, POI, PON, POD.

While in POI was in a group when one char mentioned "shame nobody is flagged
for factory".

Have also heard things about having keys for certain zones, and "mini raids"

Now Im aware that at 56 (though Im still growing and learning) I would need
to be somehwat bigger and more experienced to venture further, but can
someone kindly explain some things and suggest something along the lines of
the following.

1. What is/are flags/keys?

2 To where should I aim to get flagged first?

3 How do I get flag for any particualr zone?

4 A brief explanation of "mini raids"

5 Any other basic, "next step forward" kind of tips.

Thanks in anticipation.
