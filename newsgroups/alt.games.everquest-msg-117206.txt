That's what I'm doing with the SK, and am really enjoying it.  Worked the
named scarabs in Rathe Mountains rather than NRo/Oasis through 11, and I'm
probably going to move over to the lizardman camp now that he's 12.  Then
it's on to the Overthere (another zone that I didn't with the druid until he
was 30+) and points beyond.
