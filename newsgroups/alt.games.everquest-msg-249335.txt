On Fri, 28 May 2004 01:44:58 GMT, I needed a babel fish to understand
"hughes" <hughesiv@earthlink.net> :

>1)remove the no drop flag from all loot.
could go either way on this

>2)add graveyards and bindable spots to god zones.
yeah this would be good

>3)set monk defensive ability lower than a warriors and higher than a rogues.
sure I can see this

>4)remove the essence emerald from necro res.
wouldn't mind, my necro is getting close to the level

>5)add crappy resses to shamans.
would add more to them ... dono though

>6)nerf beastlord clarity buffs (sd, paragon etc) from clarity atk to regen
>atk.
are you fucking nuts.... don't touch my beast crack

>7)change groups from max 6 people to max 8 people rebalancing instances.
er no, why, its fine with 6.  id be fine with 8, but there is NOT a
need

>8)remove the necessity to farm to enter any zone, raid encounters are fine
>but not if they must be triggered by countless hours of work(veeshans peak,
>vex thal, smith rondo ) kill mob is plenty no bullshit needed
sure, im against time sinks... 

>9)flag accounts not characters, the first time is fun the rest is just make
>work.
naw, id rather them just make flags a level requirement, not an actual
flag

>10)add the expedition functionality to ldons.
No idea what your on about with this.

LoY had some of the best designed zones I've ever been in...

LDON is all wrong with the gather points in some specific camp and can
sue only there.  waste of my time.  let me hunt where my group wants
to hunt, and let me spend my points where I want to spend em.
