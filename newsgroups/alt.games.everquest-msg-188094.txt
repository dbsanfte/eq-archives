I just started into EQ myself...actually...last Friday the 14th...so let me
say I sympathize.

Definitely check the site JoeBlow mentioned out.  They are pretty good.

As a new user there is a pretty steep learning curve, but the game is very
very fun and addictive.  It encourages playing with other people, and I have
met some pretty nice and giving folks online.  I haven't asked for anything,
but they have offered to help with "buffs" etc.  It is pretty cool actually.

I bought the Gold edition because it is such a great value.  The only thing
it doesn't come with the Legend of Kyesha9(sp?).  I wish it did because the
mapping feature would have been nice to have those first few hours where all
I did was get my bearings.

I bought 1 month of service to see if I would like it.  I think I do.  It
also doesn't require the massive daily time committment that say Ultima
Online requires.  I have only played for like maybe 5 hours and I'm already
level 5.  So...you can pretty much play at your own rate...which is key
because I do have a life outside the computer world.

If you have any questions you can email me directly.  Just take the junk out
of my email address.
