True.  However, I wonder how much games like Planetside (and SWG, for that
matter) are propped up by EQ's numbers.  If EQ's numbers decline without the
expected growth in EQ2 (unlikely, but just for the sake of discussion), I
suspect that the Planetsides of the world will be eliminated before EQ is.

Server contraction is another matter, though.  There is a post currently on
the EQLive tech supports forums from a player on Kane Bale that says the
server is a "ghost town" (the poster's words).  I know that this probably
wasn't the correct place for him to voice his concern over his server, but
at the same time I wasn't aware that any server had such a population drop.
I've never been on Kane Bayle, so I can't speak to the accuracy of the
player's claim.
