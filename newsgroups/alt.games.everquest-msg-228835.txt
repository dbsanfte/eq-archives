I have a little question for you all here.

I've been playing in TD killing the raptors for exp. I will
occasionally charm one (usually Dinus) for fun and take out a few with
him and then kill him off. I have read that mag pets take exp when
they fight, and it is a fair share if the pet does over 50% damage to
the mob or 1% if less then 50% damage.

My question is: 

Do charmed pets do the same? If so, if you kill the pet do you get
more exp from it then if you did not charm it and dot him to oblivion?

Thanks for any info you have fer me. Exp been getting kinda slow
around level 54.
