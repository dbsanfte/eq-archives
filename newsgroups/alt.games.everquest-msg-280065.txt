There was this article some weeks ago,which talked about the
tecnical aspects of MMORPGs,maybe you remember it,there
the number of average 10k per server was mentioned.
Another hint would be from the time,when Verant showed us
the number of players currently online,in the average on SolRo
this was about 2.5k.
So I think 10k active accounts per server is pretty close.
