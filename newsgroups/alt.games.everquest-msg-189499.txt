Go for more RAM, but be careful if you are running Windows 98SE or below.
They don't like more than 340 something MB of RAM. When I upgraded to 512MB
I had to upgrade my OS too.

Also, if you go for a graphics card avoid getting a GeForce 4, lots of
people (myself included) seem to be having problems with Direct X 8.1 on
that card and Luclin requires you have it installed to run.
