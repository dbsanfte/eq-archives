    KTXAD. After a while, you learn the abbreviations for some of the big
ones. I still couldn't tell the difference between DXXV, DXV, and some of
the other "D" mobs that live above the rotating shield/sword/book. But AHR,
VXAHR, KTXAHR - those mobs you begin to know off by heart.

    Congrats on the Darkclaw Amulet! When we first started going there, one
of our top clerics misread the Lucy description of what it did and asked for
it thinking it was 20% off all beneficial spells. That helped me when it was
time to get my neckpiece, because she was locked into the old one. She also
asked for a cleric-only hammer in PoP because the item description listed
PRI/SEC, even though it could NOT be equipped in SEC as it was a weapon, and
she wanted a replacement for her shield. Stay up late doing XP, pay the
price the next day!

    I'll guess it was High Priest, and was he holding a Bloodbath!

    I've never had a buggy 20 K. Must be frustrating as hell. Do you set
yourself up underneath the mural thing in the back of the alcove so you
don't fly up as high?

    This is foreshadowing. We all know what's going to happen next, so why
you didn't is surprising. ;-)

    Good shoulders from VT are Twilight Shroud and Rune of Judgement. Good,
simple mana preservation item is the Obsidian Necklace.

    Remember the room with the sword? All around the paths you run on are
drop-offs to lava. We used to always have someone bounce off someone else
and drop down. Same deal in the other rooms with items in the middle.

> Jeebus.  We're about to wipe to a Vex Thal boss mob that's at zero

    That's when you start asking questions like, "Did everyone have a damage
shield" and "Can someone SoW in Nexus, please?"

    That's even better. Imagine how bad it would have been had no people
with res lived. "Um, us eight get loot, and then?"

    Usually you stay awake until the Aten blobs, assuming you kill them.
Those are long, long, long, boring fights, even for Vex Thal. =/
