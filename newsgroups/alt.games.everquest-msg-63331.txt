You must give a pet 2 weapons for it to dual wield.
It has been my experience that pets with weapons are
superior to those without. I think their attack skill improves
with a weapon even though I have no direct proof of that.
(I did notice that while playing a Monster PC on the test server
my attack value would go up when I equipped a weapon. Wether
that has any correlation to a real monster NPC is speculation.)
Velium weapons would work great, since they have a proc.

It was changed a while back where giving a pet a
fast weapon would increase its attack speed while
not affecting its normal damage hit. For instance if a pet's
normal h2h attack was 10/30 and you gave it a FS dagger (3/19)
then the pet's attack would become 10/19. But now the weapons
do not change the delay.

The pets will still increase their damage if the weapon you give them
has a higher base damage than what they normally have with no weapon.
So if you gave the 10/30 pet a 12/52 weapon its attack would now
become 12/30.
