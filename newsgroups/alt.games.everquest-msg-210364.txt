I've seen the Hope Diamond go for as low as 500pp on Xev, but it's more
often going for 750-1500pp on the rare occasions it's being sold at all.
Good luck on getting it cheap! Or you could just wait for 10-20 more
levels and hunt it yourself with some friends...

The Fine Antique Ring from PoK has Mana Conservation II and will cost you
about 1p5g worth of Sarnak Blood. You will need some help with invisibility.
I'd recommend a Bard for this, if you can find one.

The easiest way to B2 is to hug the wall. *High* up on the wall. *Higher*.
You can get almost all the way up to the ceiling, which is out of aggro
range of the bandits there.
