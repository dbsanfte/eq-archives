I think you messed up rather badly here. You will be very lucky if you
don't have to pay damages or something.

Saying someone is stalking you, or bothering you in EQ is one thing.
Posting in public newsgroups about someone being into kiddie porn and
stalking youths is another.  The later one is pretty serious and could
get you into hot legal water.
