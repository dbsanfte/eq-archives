    Hey hopefully without seeming to pick whatever side DT isn't on, I'd
have to go with rumble on this one. If you have a problem with a tank's
attitude, point out where you think he's wrong, but dont lie. Dishonesty
isn't good for a group.

    A number of times I've thought "yeah no way will i need a Symbol here
we're totally trashing these mobs" and then we triple pull and wipe cos I
was 300hp short haha. On the other hand in 90% of cases the risk of that
happening is so slight that Symbol isn't worth casting all the time.... too
fkn expensive. Still, discuss it with the tank, don't lie to him... Lying
sucks and if groups talked about tactics more they'd wipe less and the game
would be just a bit more interesting!

Cheers,
James
