Did to me, Lenny, thank you.

Anyone who doesn't think pets should be spayed or neutered needs to 
volunteer regularly for a humane society or animal care shelter. First 
of all, there's never enough volunteers. And there's always too many 
animals with never enough room.

I can tell you stories of my year+ as a volunteer. My shelter worked on 
the no-kill until full system- so dogs usually managed to stay all 
winter if we didn't find homes for them. Cats unfortunately were full 
all year, so once a month or more often, we had to make room the only 
way we could.

One particular story was Cocoa. She's a hound mix, brought in because 
someone dumped her - not at our door - on the side of the street near 
the woods, so she could "fend for herself". She was easy to catch 
because she was pregnant. We couldn't find a home for her because of her 
pregnancy, and she was too far along to just spay anyway. Yes, that 
would kill the puppies. This was done in our shelter sometimes, because 
puppies or kittens need to be cared for until they are old enough to 
leave their mom, preventing anyone else to use that cage for 6 weeks or 
so, and preventing more than one animal to be in that very large cage. 
It's also routine to spay any dog or cat that goes into heat 
immediately. One shelter I applied to work at has a policy of putting 
down all animals that go into heat. Shelters make their own policies.

Cocoa eventually had 22 puppies. That's a LOT of puppies. Two were 
pushed out of the nest in first 24 hours, and another 2 the second day. 
I managed to find one of these rejected pups still alive and bottlefed 
it myself for 3 days before it died. But 18 puppies is still a lot of 
puppies to find homes for. We barely managed. It was also a LOT of work 
trying to herd puppies from a dirty cage to a clean one, so they could 
have a clean place.

And in the end, no one wanted Cocoa.

I always donate often to animal shelters when I can afford it. I stopped 
volunteering when I couldn't take the strain any more- it's very hard to 
kill the one thing you are working so hard to save. The emotional toll 
is unbelievable.
