Vendui everyone !

I was Memdaynar Laar'Adrym on Erolisi Marr a few years ago and after playing
AO, DAoC and SWG I am coming back to EQ, the best game imho.

I was just wondering if the people I knew back were still around:
Shadowlyth, Jailient, Innsipid, Aurra.

I should receive the game sometime next week and after days of downloading
(we still cannot get anything better than standard dial-up around here) I
will be back.
