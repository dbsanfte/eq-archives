Temporary I would imagine.  It's not the first time they have been around.
Periodically the boats "break" for lack of a better term ("bugged"...there was a
better term...).  While the boats are out of service they park those
translocators at the docks so that people can still get to their destinations.
I remember the first time I saw one in East Freeport.  I sat for a half hour
waiting for the boat before I figured out what the little guy was for.
