Late yesterday evening I went into Lake Rathetear with my level
20 enchanter.  He is not very twinked so he really can't relyably
take a 2 spawn, I notice there are only 5 people in the zone, me,
two level 18s, a level 26 and level 54.  I ask the 18s where they
are camping, they say they are halping eachother solo the arena.
I think great and head off to the single...

Here I find the single spawn up and a druid sitting there.

<Me>  Are you hunitng the single?
<Druid>  Yes.

It's late so I think about heading off to bed...

<Druid> have been all night and people keep bugging me for this
spot.

Not going to bed anymore, do /who druid ==> level 26.

<Me>  why are you camping the single?
<Druid>  He is GREAT exp.
<Me>  I know, but don't you think you could get better EXP at the
2 or 3 spawn?
<Druid> I can't take 2 or 3 at once.
<Me>  Why don't you use your lull spell so you only pull one.
<Druid>  What lull spell?
<Me>  I'm not sure of the name... Tranquility or something like
that?
<Druid>  I probably didn't both buying it.

I was too tired at this point to try to solo the two spawn, so I
gave up the battle and went off to bed.  I was temped to give him
breeze, but I didn't want to get into a discussion about why he
would want it...
