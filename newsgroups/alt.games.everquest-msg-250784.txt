(The following is a (cough) fairy tale based on occurrances that might
have happened and any similarity between the people involved and the
actual incidents is purely coincidental.)
_____________________________

Once upon a time in a small Oklahoma city far far away, there was a
Vice President at First American Bank and Trust Co. named (cough and
then looks up and around) The Old Druid who plead guilty to making a
false statement on a signed loan application.  He couldn't mediate a
resolution in regard to a problem with a house he bought and sued here
and sued there, sued everywhere until he sued so much that he finally
got caught for his own illegal action.  This didn't settle well with
his employer.  He then either lost his job over it or was forced to
resign to spare the bank any further embarrassment. 

"Oh....what am I going to do now?" he cried, "I only have a four year
degree in farming.  In fact, how in the world did I get hired as a
vice president of a bank?" 

He thought and he thought and with a twinkle in his eye, he said..."I
don't need any further education to practice psychology.  I think I
will take some money I "saved" (or whatever) from the bank I used to
work at and start a business."  Fortunately, his wife was kind enough
to use her intellect in helping him get started just like she did
graduating him through college.

Once he got his career situated the State of Oklahoma threw a wrench
into things by announcing a 2.6 million dollar budget cut in Mental
Health Services AND requiring all practicing psychologists to have a
Master's Degree.  This didn't settle well for The Old Druid and he
argued and complained.  He snorted, "This is stupid..duh huh huh...The
cuts are being made indiscriminately,'' he said. ''We're talking about
some people who will wind up living under bridges.''  He said that
others will be forced to stop taking needed medication and wind up
back in prison (as if he really cares more about them than the money
he can make off them).  ''We're not taking care of our mentally ill
residents of Oklahoma,'' he said.  He still isn't really, but that's
another story. 

So, The Old Druid trods back to his wife and tells her about his
delimma.  "Don't worry about a Master's Degree hun.  I can help you
with that and you will hardly have to lift a finger," she said.
"Thanks hun," he replied and they jumped in the sack for their
bi-monthly 9:30PM romp.  "I was getting all backed up and cranky," he
said, "but everything is ok now.  Thanks dear."  

A few years pass and The Old Druid's wife graduates him with a
Master's in psychology.   "Now I can help others....if I figure out
how I'm actually supposed to do that," he said smiling while framing
his sheepskin.  "Nevermind.  I'll just hire people to do it for me and
then see 1 or 2 patients a week so that everyone thinks I do
something. Hmmm...what will I do in my spare time though?"

At that moment, The Old Druid's son walks in and says, "Hi Dad.  I
wanted to show you this new game called Everquest.  It's a lot of fun.
Oh, by the way, do you have $100,000 so my friend and I can start a
computer business?  I promise you that we know what we're doing and it
will be profitable for you."  All of a sudden there was a clatter
outside like Pinocchio somehow pole vaulting into a mass of tree
limbs.  They just shrugged the noise off and continued.

"Everquest?  Hmmm.  I can barely use a computer.  I'm used to paper
trails, not digital trails, but I'll give it a try," he said.   So,
the years passed and clients came in and out of the office and
employees were bustling around tending to business. 

"What's all that racket?!  It's too goddamn noisy in here.  I can't
stand all this noise," The Old Druid shouted as he got up to close his
office door.   "How can I concentrate on my quest with all that racket
going on out there?  Just keep it quiet and collect the money.  That's
all I care about."

"Now....let me get back to my online friends and practice being kind."

The next day...
