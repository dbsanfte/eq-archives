Wow! All I can say is.... WOW! That is one seriously skewed way to view
the results of the polls, James. (Only my opinion, of course.) Nearly
half apparently said "no" to TCC in any way shape or form. And the way I
read the statements from VI, the other nearly half would "accept" *some*
way to cut down on bottom feeding, etc. but felt that the way it was
being implemented totally missed the mark.  Implementing the same damn
thing here, though with fewer no-drop items, solves nothing as I see it.
More likely is the theory put forward by another poster in this thread.
They probably built the whole system before the poll was done, and it's
too late to go back and pull it out now. Or so they think.
