Aye, I agree, heh.  Makes it tricky for a lowly, but (hopefully up and
coming) Necro to make an informed choice.  At my levels (37) even the
Cleric I fed mana to thought I'd be better off Dotting, and so on...

That sounds reasonable to me, also.

That sounds VERY reasonable to me as well, and I think your post was
the clincher for me. "Idiots LOM do NOT get fed with mana" seems a
sound rule to go by.

Well, AA's are far on my horizon as yet, but it's nice to know we can
solo for them  :)  As you say, it's fun to group, and even the
screwups can be fun, in my opinion.
