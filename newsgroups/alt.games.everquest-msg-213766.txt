You're right, it wouldn't.  There's only one server where the average
equipment level wouldn't be high enough for four groups of mid-50s to look
like gods compared to four groups of mid-50s a couple years back.

Every single one of the NToV dragons can be done without a single caster
ever getting hit by an AE.  As long as you have a reasonable mix of classes,
there should be plenty of healing for the melees.  And if not, do what I
remind my guild melees to do all the time, survive.  Better to lose your DPS
for a little while so you can go hide with the casters and get a heal when
someone gets to you, than to lose your DPS for the rest of the fight and pull
the aggro off the MT because your dumb ass had to stand out there and die.

For someone just getting to NToV, even the reduced stats is better by far
than the crap of yesteryear.  The biggest improvement comes in the form of
weapons.  My 51 ranger is wielding droppable 14/20 and 13/20 weapons, with
1+ ratio 2h weapons in a bag.  When I first stepped foot in NToV, we were
*looking* for stuff like that.  :P

Most of the droppable stuff is recommended 51, 53 and 55, with a few coming
in at 58 and a bunch of player-made jewelry recommended at level 60. 
Chances are that equipment would be pretty close to max for a raid force of
"mid-50s".

PoP droppable gear.  PoP droppable gear.  *PoP* droppable gear.  Say goodbye
to 2002, it's never coming back.  :)

If you one-group a dragon, you're generally not winning by DPS.  You're
winning by attrition.  More DPS will always help in any fight, of course,
but it's the healing power of a VoQ'ed, FT15'ed, AA'ed cleric that's gonna
carry the day in a one-group NToV takedown.

Most of it is still a step above anything droppable (weapons get outdated
the fastest except for toys like blackstar).  The biggest improvement is
obviously the +hp that permeates NToV items, and with every one of those
they loot the fights just get easier.

Use strategy.  Send a rogue in to aggro that one "wurm dragon" guy on the
right past Aary, and poof don't have to deal with Aary unless you absolutely
want to.  Who cares if you're "gimping" it, you're being told you can't
possibly do it anyway.

Moral of the story, fight smarter, not harder.
