If you pay for allakhazam's Premium Service, you get to use the search
facility, which is good. You also get to browse EQAtlas with no ads,
which is nice.

EQPrices is not worth paying for IMO - you wanna find out what something
goes for on your server, ask in the market zone.

EQMaps is also not worth it IMO, since Map List By Zone is free, and you
only need access to one item database really.
