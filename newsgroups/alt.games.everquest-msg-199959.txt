I don't know what you're complaining about.  I just got sucked in by a
newspaper headline and read a column about rude behavior... Now I've
gotta go check out rudebusters.com and see just how much of an ass I
really am (self tests, what fun!).  Other on-line resources listed in
the column are HumanityQuest.com and Taxtherude.com.  (I love how the
newspapers feel they need to list 2 or 3 websites as "additional
resources" regarding damned near anything these days.)
