Looting your corpse takes the same amount of time for everyone: there is
no class (well, maybe some monks) that doesn't come close to filling every

available slot on their body... perhaps you'll see an open ammo slot on
a well equipped caster.  (human casters will likely be sporting a
coldstone/
heatstone there)
