No, it's not a "D'Vinn spawned! Come help!" thing- it's more of everyone
inquiring "Where are folks hunting today, and what level?" for pick up
groups with guildies. Sure, some of the higher level folks may be asked
for ports to get there- but they have full rights to say "No, I'm busy".
They also have full rights to camp the higher level character and bring
a lower along.

This is what happend in my guildchat. My guild is proud of being a
family guild with characters from 1 to 55. We'd go to 60, but no one
that high has asked to join, and we haven't grown any that high. (The 55
JOINED at 55, and has a couple alts in)

Again, it depends on what you want out of a guild.

I believe that there is no difference between you being online anon with
/gu off, and not being in a guild.
