Aye, "pos" is a very questionable judgement of a weapon that will do
90% or more of the DPS of another that sells for 100x as much.  But
then "pos" is the usual comment of EQ players on items that aren't
best in class (in this case, "class" is bazaar loot 1HB for Paladins),
especially if they are relatively easy to acquire. (Thus showing us
that, contrary to popular opinion, Ben is actually quite "normal",
muahahaha!)
