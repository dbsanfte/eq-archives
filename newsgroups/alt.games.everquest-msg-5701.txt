DarkBargainers: Neriak merchants (and some DE merchants elsewhere,
    like in South Ro).

DreadGuardsOuter:  Neriak guards in Nektulos Forest, and maybe the
     ones in Foreign Quarter (if not, then the FQ guards are in
     the following faction group).

DreadGuardsInner:  Guards inside Neriak.

IndigoBrotherhood:  Warrior's guild in Neriak.


The first three can be increased (with no decreases of any sort)
via the Red Wine quest in Neriak.  The last one is, as far as I
know, impossible to raise without hosing a "good" faction
(like wood elves) at the same time.
