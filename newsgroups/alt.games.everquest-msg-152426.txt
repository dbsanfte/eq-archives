Newsreaders are for wusses:

    $ telnet your_news_server 119
    [server says stuff]
    post
    [server says go ahead]
    Newsgroups: alt.games.everquest
    Subject: put subject here
    From: whatever@wherever

    Type your posting here.  End it with
    a line with a single "." on it.
    .
    [server says stuff]
    quit

If the server bitches about some missing header required, try again, this
time including that header (I don't recall which headers are required).
