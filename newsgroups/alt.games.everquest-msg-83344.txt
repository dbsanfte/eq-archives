yeah, the only thing i liked about DAoC was the absence of corpse runs, If a
server was setup for EQ (test server would be fine) I wou try it. Imagin a
special Zek server with no corpse runs. Looting would be automagic - and
then the corps repops at the bind or just like an auto rez (minus loot/ep)
other wise Daoc is boaring.
