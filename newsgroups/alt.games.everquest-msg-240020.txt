You obviously have no clue what a troll is. A troll isn't someone who
makes a lot of posts. A troll isn't someone who flames people for
being idiots. A troll is someone who acts like an idiot intending to
start fights.

If you've never seen me being helpful, you haven't been paying
attention. That, or you're real good at your selective filtering of
what you read.
