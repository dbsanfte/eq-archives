Still got your panties in a bunch over a thread that did not involve you in
the least until you decided to enter it slinging insults. I have read
several threads where you have "interjected" your little comments on your

you are just a little child who feels it is his right or duty to piss off as
many people as possible in a day, also known as a sociopath.
