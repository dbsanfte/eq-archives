Don't make it hard on yourself and try to do the onestep faction quests 
in shadowhaven...not worth it.
only one worth the trouble is the register for trading quest.  Bind next 
to the Trade Commissioner and say 'i will deliver the letters', take the 
letter he gives you to Sateal in the Bazaar, gate back and give Sales 
report to Trade Commissioner then get ready to run... go to where the 
soulbinder is and go thru the secret entrance to Echo caverns.  The key 
to getting past the plants is not to stop, use autorun <numlock> on my 
keyboard.  Used to be getting tagged by one of them was instant death no 
matter the level, took down a level 54 friend of mine, last time I went 
thru it let my baby druid go with only 20 hp left<whew>.  Seems like 
they changed the root aspect to actually give you a chance to get away. 
  Take you letter to Thar Anton in FG.  Not to worry nothing in town to 
hurt you.  Gate back to Trade commissioner for final turn in.(no sense 
going thru the caves unless you really like looking at the plants) 
You'll get a nifty necklace that will now change your faction in the 
whole town of shadowhaven.  Pretty useful now.
