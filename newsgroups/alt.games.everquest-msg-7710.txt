ebay rants go along the lines of a newbie buying a high level PC and getting
everyone killed because they don't know the ropes or the nuiances of their
characters at high levels

Druids are everywhere and played by mostly younger less mature people (same
can be said for necros), wondering why no one wants to group with them at
high levels.

Although, I have not had any problems with druids (or necros), so I can't
rant about that, and their wonderful abundance has helped my running speed
to no end, and yes I group with them alot.
