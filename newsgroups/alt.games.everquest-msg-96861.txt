..."outside your chat window"...  /boggle
If this means what I think it does, *very* nice...

I've been /bugging this after every patch for the past several
months.  It had *never* worked.

"You sense your corpse in this direction".  Um no, actually, I don't.
Or fire Sense Undead and get, "You sense undead in this direction".
Gee, that's funny, it was exactly the same direction I had already
been facing.  How... handy.

I'm speechless.  This is... huge.

Well, actually it's a minor thing, but liberating in its effect.
For two years now, I, like so many other people, have been 
doing a "/gu Zoning..." warning whenever there's any sort of
guild chat going on, which was shorthand for, "Notice, I'm about
to zone now, so if you send any message with the expectation that
I'll see it, I won't, so please hold off for about 30 seconds, because
the game is too stupid to queue up any messages that come in during
the zoning process, dammit".

And I've lost count of the number of times I've stood by a zone
line I wanted to cross to get somewhere, just because I was
chatting with someone and didn't want to risk losing a /tell.

And all along, I was annoyed because I'm a programmer and knew
that it wasn't a major glitch to overcome if they had just
bothered to care about it and spend a little time tweaking
how the program handles messages.

Bravo.

About FUCKING time...

1.  Whose bright idea was it to give this automatically
to newbies in the first place?

2.  Why did it take them THREE YEARS to get around to
noticing that it was a bad idea and stop doing it?

I can't wait for the first time a raid leader misses a
winning roll on a piece of dragon loot he's awarding because
the winner annoyed him with auction spam fifteen levels ago...  :-)

"And the uber-item goes to Bob, congrats"
"Hey, wait, Barney had a higher roll!"
"What?  No he didn't.  He didn't even roll.  What scam
are you trying to pull here?"
<riot ensues>

This is another "small, but wow" feature.  It has always been
really annoying to be almost done typing a long message to
someone, only to smack into the zone line a few seconds before
you expected to and lose the message.


>- AA targeting issues should be fixed now

Huh?

Cool.  Now will the resurrection timer actually be accurate
as well?  For dueled corpses, at least, the rez timer lies.
It claims three hours, but the corpse will be unrezzable after
ten minutes.

Monks of Norrath, rejoice!

This was another "what took them so long?" fix.  It should have
been trivial to make the failure condition *not* reset the Mend
timer all over again.

Heh.

My eyes thank you.  It would flash from normal to black and
back again at about ten cycles per second.

Amazingly enough, there actually seems to *be* one now.
And they like us, they really like us...
