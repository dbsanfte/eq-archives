  No, you should feel good about it.  If you hadn't bought it, somebody
else would have, and besides, you couldn't have made the deal without
his consent.  If he exercised a bit more patience, he would've gotten a
better price, but he didn't.  It's your gain, whether or not it was his
"loss" is for him to decide.  Nobody was putting a gun to his head.

  As for people thinking you're a twink, big deal.  Most people don't
look down on twinking anyway, and for those few people who are going to
jump to the conclusion that you're twinked and judge you negatively for
it... well, screw 'em.  They won't hurt your gameplay in any major way,
so there's only really the "guilt factor," and you don't have a damn
thing to feel guilty about.

  So don't worry about it.
