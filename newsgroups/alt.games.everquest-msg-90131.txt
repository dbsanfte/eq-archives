You can do the Bonethunder Staff quest that starts in the Temple of Karana
in South Qeynos.  That should keep you busy for a while....especially if you
opt for the route of feeding the giant bear Mammoth regurgatonic instead of
trying to kill him.

You'll have to get allied with Knights of Thunder to complete the quest.
Save up your bone chips to hand in to Wolten Grafe.

The quest will take you to the Qeynos Catacombs (to get the Order of Thunder
medallion so you can get the start of the quest, the Thunderstaff), Surefall
Glade, Ak'anon, back to Surefall, and back to South Qeynos again.

The item you'll eventually end up with is a Paladin useable 2hb that is
9/38ish, +3 Wisdom, and procs Ward Undead.  Not great stuff, but it is no
drop, and you will feel a sense of having accomplished something when you're
finished.

Oh, and for some odd reason, it can also be worn on your back slot, for
those times when you need just a little bit of extra wisdom, but your hands
are full.
