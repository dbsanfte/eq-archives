Bah, we Shamen ar enot tanks at all. You see us described as hybrids
everywhere etc, but we aren't really. We're not something like Pallys
or SK and our tanking ability is by far exaggerated. Maybe not in the
very low levels, where everyone can can tank, but at level 50 now
(and honestly it's like that since about level 16/20), we're not
at all tanks. We're armoured casters, our AGI sucks, we have nearly
no combat abilities (there's the low capped dodge) and that's it.
While a real caster dies like a fly when aggored, we die like .. er ..
two flies. not more :) (if you can't get your root etc off). We're
pretty good at saving our ass in a group when aggroed (AC, root, sow
etc), but we can not play War/SK/Pal/Monk/Rng etc .. they are the
melees.

Shamen are fun .. you're setup for root & dot/dd then, as you both
get root and damage spells. Dot with shaman .. wait with DD to not
break root, finish off mob.

It will all get differend at level 34, where the shaman gets a pet.
You'll be pretty strong then. My pet can currently solo a low (not
high or caster) blue, when buffed and the enemy slowed. You'll
learn that slow is about one of the best spells in game. Especially
sinc eyou two are casters and want to get your root etc off if
aggroed. But up to 34, you might want to invite the occasional tank
friend to be really effective. As a shaman, you can heal reasonably
well heal up till level 34 .. after that, clerics become a need for
tanks.

Bah. We men are always easy to manipulate. Only takes a bit
of fitness training and high heels :P

That's nice. I always liked those 'Eww, meez gotta bumbash

bit of an overlaod sometimes .. but if he's a cool guy, things
are a blast.
