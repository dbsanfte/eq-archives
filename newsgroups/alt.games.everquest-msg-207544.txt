I two-box a Paladin and a Bard.  Probably not the most
powerful duo, but incredibly versatile.

Some advantages off the top of my head:

1.  FAST travel times (or escape runs).

2.  The Bard never has to be the tank, which is
good because they're not built for it.

3.  Adds are easily mezzed/charmed.

4.  Constant mana regen for the Paladin, so heals
are abundant.

5.  The Bard adds a surprising amount of melee
damage when parked behind the mob.  Can be
stacked with the Bard's damage songs if I really
want to burn things down fast.

6.  Haste/Slow available whenever appropriate.

7.  Mega-resists when needed.

8.  A Lull line that affects mobs up to level 60
(at my Bard's level), whereas even a 65 Paladin's
Pacify line caps out at level 55 mobs, making single-pulling
a breeze.

9.  Can be group-invised on a moment's notice.

10.  Mobs can be snared, thank Brell.  BIG help in
most situations, and absolutely vital in others.

11. If the Bard croaks, he can just be rezzed right
back, although the Paladin's heals usually keep
the Bard alive whenever he gets aggro.

12.  The whole bag of tricks a Bard brings for special
circumstances, including levitation, runeshield, identify,
corpse location, faction modification, AoE damage,
enduring breath, bind sight, eye of Zomm, Fear,
stat boosts, mana sieve, etc.
