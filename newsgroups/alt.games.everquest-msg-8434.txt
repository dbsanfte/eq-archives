    Hi, I just made 24 last night, and was told that the Earth and Air pets
are buyable and Water and Fire need to be researched. I got Earth in FP, and
have been unable to find Air. I checked Ak Anon, Felwithe and Freeport. Any
ideas??
    And I just now trained my Research skill and researched Everfount and
Cornucopia. Are those 2 spells good for Practice?? I was only able to dump
so many points into research, and dont have much money to spend in failed
pet research. What skill level would make pet research a good chance to
succeed?
Thanks
