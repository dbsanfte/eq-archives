Good posts.
I'll add that you should almost always have a root spell memmed for
ghetto mezzing when a chanter is not available.  Don't be afraid to
get hit.  If you get agro, stand there, root the sucker, and back off.

Also, learn to conserve your mana.  It's tempting to get up and melee,
or nuke, and sometimes this is, in fact, a viable option.  However,
remember that on occasion, things can go to hell very quickly, and
that extra bit of mana you got from medding instead of nuking or
meleeing can mean the difference between a close call and a total
wipeout.  Mana conservation is important for all casters, but people
start to panic when the cleric goes oom in the middle of a tough
fight.  If you want to melee, do so when you are at or near fm.  Nuke
only when at or near fm, and you know that you can handle it.  Our
nukes are not great anyway (cept for the undead ones), so be
conservative when deciding to do so.

Don't be afraid to insist on getting reimbursed for spell reagents
when the loot is available to pay for it.- This will not necessarily
make you a better cleric, but it does allow you to occasionally afford
an equipment upgrade, which in the long run, is good for your future
groups.  If you are not in a zone where the loot will pay for your
expenses, then you have to use your own judgment as to whether symbols
are actually necessary.
