Best way I've found is to put the spells you use at your level at the
front of the book. As you get new spells that upgrade the old ones,
move them to the back of the book starting from the last page and
working forward. Further, I put the scribe slots in the order I
usually keep the spells memmed on the first two pages, then work back
on other spells I switch out for frequently, keeping them grouped by
type from there. The ports are at the end of my front section in order
of rings, circles, then evacs.
