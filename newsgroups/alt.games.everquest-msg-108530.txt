It is, and I'll tell you why.

1. Most people who top post don't bother to snip irrelevant text. It
all adds up.

2. Usenet isn't jeopardy. You don't start with the answer and move on
to the questions in real life, do you?

3. Many of those who take top posting close to their heart also see
other people having cool sigs, and they decide they want a cool sig
too. Only problem is, with them, their sigs have a marker that lets
people who use GOOD newsreaders automatically trim them when
responding. That trim, however, will include everything below the sig
indicator. Including most previously quoted text, which usually has
the context you need. People who top post generally don't know about
this.

>"wrong."

Incorrect, the standards of the newsgroup in question most definately
is. There are newsgroups where top posting and not quoting anything at
all are the norm; it would be out of place to mention it there. This
isn't one of those places, though. The mere fact people *do* mention
it is the big tipoff.

You're welcome to try and change it; I wouldn't count on success.

If they are annoyed they are welcome to stop top posting. Problem
solved.

I will say Top Post corrected from time to time, but I don't lead off
with it. It comes at the end. I will continue to do so in threads that
are improved by having the response below the context.

Do tell.... I don't care to repeat this litany every time someone top
posts. That is no less anal than someone who does nothing but point
out spelling mistakes. If they want to know why they are wrong, they
can ask.
