I have been soloing last week a nice cycle camp of static spawns where i
dont have to fear to get jumped by adds, so here:

1 Chaos flux
2 Suffocate
3 Enthrall
4 Tashani
5 Languid pace (Still havent found the other page for research of tepid)
6 Listless power
7 Root
8 <Buff slot> Here i stick the buff i assume will go next down while
medding.

My current tactic is to summon a pet, buff it with obfuscate and
augmentation.
Then i pick the mob i am going to kill. enthrall it and then in peace debuf
it with tashani, languid pace and listless power and root it down. Finally i
go stand right next to the mob and start casting suffocate. Immeadiately
when the cast bar vanishes i back up. The mob gets to try and hit me once
when enthrall breaks. I finalize the preparations with one chaos flux and it
to meditate.
At this point i target my pet and wait for it's health to go below my mana.
If it goes, i stand up, nuke once and start waiting again.
Many times this goes very smoothly but ofcourse at times get resists. Just
rely on root. Because all of the soloing by defence and dodge is so good i
rarely get hit if i'm not encumbered.
Oh yeah, and i always keep up major shielding, obfuscate and clarity on
myself.

Dunno if this is a good tactic, have been on a break and this is just what i
have found to be effective soloing with a chanter.

Oh wait, you asked just for the slots i use. Ohwell, i have a tendency to
ramble. :)
