Heh. I've used the same email address since around 1995, and it's 
probably in every single mailing list in the world by now. 20-40 pieces 
of spam a day is about average for me.

One of these days I'll get around to configure procmail with a white 
list, and trash everything that doesn't come from an approved address. At 
this point, it would be the only way to handle it.
