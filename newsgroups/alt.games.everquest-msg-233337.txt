When we killed him for my snake we just took a couple of groups,
mostly melee, & rushed the room he was in.  Nothing stuck by way of
spells despite our best efforts but it dodnt take the tanks long to
see him off.

That was some time ago now, pre PoP when we were capped at 60 & in ToV
equipment.  I know there have been some changes since but no idea what
they are.  For lots of help with the Snake & other chanter issues in
general head to:
