I'm happy, I'm feeling glad. . . no, I don't have sunshine in my bag (thanks
juzami from afdl for the idea for that quote), but I DO have the Jaundiced
Bone Helm and Vambraces that I just found on a MERCHANT in Felwithe. . . for
700pp.  No, not 700pp each,  that was for the pair.  I just can't put enough
smileys in this post to show how freeking happy I am right now. (but I can
try)   :-)  :-)   :-)  :-)   That almost covers it. . .  :-)  BTW I am a lvl
35 barb warrior, and I am about to have the most money I have ever had in
EQ.  :-)
