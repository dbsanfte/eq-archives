Probably the best way to deal with it.  I had a similar situation with my 
final fight on epic 1.0, by the time a GM got back with me, I had already 
gone back to fear, gotten a replacement tear, and failed legitimately on 
the final fight, as the mage pet trick had been seriously nerfed.  Good 
news was, he replaced my original tear, so I got to go again, successfully 
that time.
