Hi all,

Seeing as there don't seem to be any newbie opinions on this one yet...

I've been playing EQ for three weeks now.  I have a level 4 wood elf ranger
in Kelethin, playing New Dawn so I have all expansions bar LoY and PoP.  I
discovered the portal to The Nexus after about a week, went there once and
realised that a) everyone else there was miles above level 4 and b) I don't
have anything to sell yet so it wasn't much use to me.  So I went back to
Kelethin.  I then got PoP yesterday, and immediately legged it to the book
to get myself to Freeport... and when I got there I realised that actually,
I'd rather have put the work in necessary to get there on foot... it just
wasn't fun getting there directly, so I went back to Kelethin and hunted
some more bats.

The point is, newbies have a choice about how they play the game.  If I was
only interested in completing my quests as quick as possible, or go
everywhere possible in the first week, then the Plane of Knowledge would be
great.  But I find it much more immersive to run places - I was really proud
of myself when I found my way to Lesser Faydark, and I wouldn't want to miss
the experience of legging it through the woods worried any minute there'd be
an orc centurion on my back.  I know PoP will be really useful when I've
done the journeys by foot a few times, and I don't think I'll be missing out
on anything to use it then, but for now I'm certainly not going to be using
it to get to places I could go to on foot.  But of course there'll be some
newbies who'd rather go places using the books.  Again, they have the choice
to do that.  A game like this will be played in different ways by different
people, and I think that's actually catered for pretty well in EQ.

On another note - this is probably the most useful newsgroup I've ever come
across :)  I wouldn't want to be a newbie without it!
