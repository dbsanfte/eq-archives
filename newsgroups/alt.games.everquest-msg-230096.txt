Actually, the mace is just a side effect sort of drop. I was attracted 
to the quest for the cloak of truth, which is better than my current 
back slot item for the cleric. I'm trying to recall what I've currently 
got in primary... (I sort of threw together this alt's gear in one day 
quite a while back.) I think it's a centi war hammer. So even though 
it's crap, it may still be a minor upgrade until I can focus on getting 
him something better.

Well, we can only try I suppose, as long as there's nothing else 
precluding the twink from getting this loot. Worst that will happen is 
we'll die and have an epic cleric camped outside the zone. I've never 
even seen this Rygan Anisher character, so not sure if he's doable or 
not. But if the Shadow Reavers drop the item I need, that might be an 
option unless I hit a bunch of those traps you're talking about. Perhaps 
I should try to conscript a rogue friend for that trip.
