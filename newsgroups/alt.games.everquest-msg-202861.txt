<<<<<<<<<Didn't hurt anyone? Try being a Cleric and not being allowed in a
group because you didn't have KEI. And when you do get a group,
constantly worrying that the group may be making better XP with a KEId
Cleric.

All because I chose not to pay the "KEI tax". On my server, that's
about 50pp every three hours.

Tell me again how KEI for everyone didn't hurt anyone.

b.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I would think that you would find this to be a help rather than a hindrance.  
I'm sure it made it harder for you to find a group initially but eventually you
found like minded group members and settled in with friends with a similar play
style.  I guess KEI wasn't that bad for you either.  Why would you want to
group with the people who didn't want you without a KEI anyway?
