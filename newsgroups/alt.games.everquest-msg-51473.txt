I am looking for an item with a dd spell that a wizzie can use.

I know Velketor the Sorcerer can drop two items with a dd spell
(both no drop and both great), but it does not seem likely  that
I will get my hand on any of those in near future.

I also know about the Soloist Icy Wand. I have killed enough mobs
in Kurns Tower to get 10 stacks of bonechips without seing the
wand. I am not sure if that wand is worth the effort.

I would be most pleased if anybody could suggest some other
items. Would be great if you could supply with info about who
drops it in which zone etc, but just the name of the item would
be a nice help too !

Best regards
