From the depths of Neriak, which has 3 zones of it's own with a very 
confusing layout.  If you are new to Neriak, it is a maze to try to get 
around in.  So, from Neriak 3rd Gate you have to zone three times just to 
get out to Nektulos forest, then run across half of that zone to get to 
the book.
