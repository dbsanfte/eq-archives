I worded that badly. I won't hit the offensive disc on a single pull
but as soon as we get more than one mob in camp I figure I might as
well burn it. 

You're right in that it isn't a big DPS increase for the group. Moreso
for my warrior than your zerker but what can I say, I like the crit
spam <g>.

My warrior is 55 atm so I don't have any of the invulnerability discs
yet but I do have defensive/evasive which lasts for 3 minutes. In a
tough situation, that's the one I'll be hitting because it will give
the cleric time to heal others and get a rough pull under control w/o
having to worry about me dying. It just seems a lot more useful for a
tank than 12 seconds of crits. 

I think it's more a matter of class than anything else though. It's
the difference between a DPS class and a tank class. 

I'm open to suggestions though. I certainly haven't played my warrior
enough to as comfortable with his as my shaman. Still lots of things
to learn about that class. 

Rgds, Frank
