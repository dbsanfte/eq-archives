Hail all , has anyone noticed a change in MOK?. We were hanginging out last
night in Katta goofin around & our cleric who hasn't used MOK in some time
Mok'd  few Legioneers & saw no hp movememnt whatsoever, he experimented for
quite a while & came to the conclusion MOK had been stealth nerfed at some
point.

Anyway just wondering anybody haveing similar findings with MOK as he
couldn't find any data from VI on any patch changes etc.

Regards, John Waters
