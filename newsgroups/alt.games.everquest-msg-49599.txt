Hi,

My main is now in Thurgadin and i have my mind set on trying to fight
the tizmak warriors, some are even to me now and most seems to be
yellow, any thoughts on how to fight them? like resistance and any
good place to fight? the mobs i'm thinking about is the ones moving
around between thurgadin and the portal, the caves is to dangerous at
this time since many of them are still red, i guess low red but still.

Any tips greatly appreciated.

/Regards Berth (Thotamon lvl 25 DE necro luclin)
