AHAHA this is WAY TOO EASY to put them down for,

"How do I become a beta tester?

Information regarding the EverQuest II beta test will be made
available on the official website. However, it is important to note
that many of our Legends subscribers will be the first to experience
EverQuest II in its beta. We will be giving preference to longtime
Legends Subscribers, so our suggestion is that if you're interested in
EverQuest Legends, sign up now. After Legends players, longtime EQ
subscribers will be eligible for a phase of the beta as well. We
realize this information is somewhat vague, and the only reason for
that is we don't have an exact date yet"

Pay us $39.95 for a "longtime" and you get in beta of EQ2!

Oh, and nice screenshots at that site and info.
