Canadians aren't American? What continent are you on again?

(Canadians always seemed like good sorts to me. Maybe we could /petition to
have Canada declared to be Northern Australia?)

My guild always schedules raids for around midday-2pm EST, which at the
moment is 4-6am Sydney time. Gah. Oh, or for 7pm weekdays = 11am next day.
There are two such raids this weekend, and a Monday evening (EST) raid
that I've politely declined.
