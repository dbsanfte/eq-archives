How does multiboxing reduce the amount of time they have to play?
All it means is that they've got 5 'friends' to help power level them... 
all a single boxer needs is 5 friends not five computers.

Organization is a collective effort. By that logic if an uberguild 
disbands the members are no longer uber. And further, a group of highly 
organized level ones would be uber. Both are not true.

I'll grant that working as a team is a important, and having real skill 
is *very* important. But the single greatest factor in EQ is equipment, 
and that comes from playing the game... a lot.

Multiboxxing is precisely the same advantage as having 1 or more regular 
play-mate (less so because multiboxers simply cannot perform as well as 
actual people). If you are going to assert multi-boxxing is cheating 
then having friends who always play together is cheating, because having 
friends is a "huge advantage".

But it defeats the point of playing the game. I'd be far better off 
putting in another hour at work, and buying the item than playing the 
game... hell... why play eq at all? I'd be far better off picking up 
another client and then simply buying stuff for the character.

Not really. Log out and send him back to work, and for another few 
hundred he'll be buying the top end drops. The problem with buying your 
way up is that you don't even need to play the game to advance. Hell he 
can even hire someone to PL him.
