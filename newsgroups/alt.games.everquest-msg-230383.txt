My bard only sings manasong between active combats, or in very large 
drawn out fights.

I figure most individual combats take a minute or two... I'm generating 
what? Less than a couple hundred mana, not even enough for a heal or a 
nuke. Better to land a mez or a slow or resists, or other cc etc; 
interrupting an incomming nuke, or mitigating damage until the 'real 
slow' lands, etc is worth far more 'mana' in healing than I'll generate 
by singing manasong for a minute or two.

In situations where we're chain pulling, mana song does go into the mix, 
but its not all I do.
