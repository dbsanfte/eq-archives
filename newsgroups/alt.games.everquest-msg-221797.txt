My personal opinion is that my own comission's face is one of the best
I've seen him do, which was an immense relief for me.  I think Foxeye's
face is pretty in her almost-anime way, which isn't true for all of his
portraits. I've always conceded that armor detail and lighting, and a
general sense for what the artist wants, are his strong points. Since I'm
personally big on clothing/armor looking right, I would choose his style
over folks that do faces better but are blah on the details.  Like I said,
you should see the chain armor on Rak's vah shir...I'll share it in a few
days for fun.  It must have driven Evan as crazy to draw as it woudl to
make it.
