Wow, you just gave me a thought.  I could see where when the rhetorical
dragon was initially charmed it would operate as itself (doing 100% of its
damage, using spells, ect.), but as the charm wore on and it began to slowly
recover its senses the damage output would scale down, becoming less and
less efficient.  Just before the charm wore off it would perhaps actually be
doing less than 50% of its damage and definitely not casting anymore.

That would be a bit more realistic, at least to me.  I could suspend
disbelief for that scenario.
