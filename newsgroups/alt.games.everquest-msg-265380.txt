Because spam sent via trojaned computers isn't all of it, or probably
even the majority of it.

Do a search and read about Alan Ralsky. "The house that spam built" will
get you lots of links.
This is one American who has made millions from spamming, one guy with a
setup of systems capable of sending over a billion spams a day -
legally.

The only thing that will stop the Alan Ralskys of the world is to make
it illegal to make money from spamming.

Make it illegal to spam in the US and they'll just send the spam from
offshore (as indeed Ralsky does).

Make it illegal to make money from it and the Alan Ralskys either have
to quit spamming, leave the US entirely or try to hide the income.

More importantly, the companies that pay "bulk email" companies to send
their ads will have to hide those ad payments, since any business gained
from the illegal spamming would also be illegal profit.
