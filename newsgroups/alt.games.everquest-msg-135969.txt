I know, I know, the same sort of thing has been said many times
in this group before this.  But it still amazes me.  I simply
cannot understand why you believe that SOE/Verant, a commercial
entity in busines to make money, would do anything else?  It
would be incredibly stupid of them not to work at making their
expansions attractive enough to induce people to buy them.  The
use of sarcasm and pejorative terms does nothing except emphasize
how naive your attitude is.
/sigh
