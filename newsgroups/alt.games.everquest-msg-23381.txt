Pfeh.  You don't need to work tech support.  Just work any job where you
deal with people off the street.  I used to work in a pizza place and
someone once asked me (I shit you not), "Which is bigger, the ten inch or
the twelve inch?"  Now how can you HELP someone like that?  The only
response I can think of is, "The answer is written real small on the asphalt
in the middle of that busy intersection over there.  Go read it."
