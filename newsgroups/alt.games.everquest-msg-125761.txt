Hmmn - a lot of people don't care where you do it - they find the fact that
you do do it offensive. Religious convictions - you know.... Just like a in
the newsgroups - we all have filters - yet some persist in being
insulted...odd.

Definately not - there would be no toilet paper.

I am not for anarchy - I just think religion has no place in civil
administration and or the justice system and or <common> moral values. It is
odd you follow up a post taking a religious stance with one mentioning world
peace.... since religion would be the biggest obstacle to that peace.

> Like I said, it's not so difficult a concept to grasp.

Yet you still seemed to have missed it. I am automatically an anarchist for
thinking religion has no place in certain areas? Well, that's an improvement
I guess, centuries ago I would have been branded a heretic and burned alive.
