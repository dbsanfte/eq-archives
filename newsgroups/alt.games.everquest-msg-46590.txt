  There is nothing we can really do to stop someone whose willing to give up
his/her life to reach an objective unless we have forewarning or catch them
in the act. Running around in a blind panic solves nothing. Trying to drive
people to hysterics is just plain wrong. We are not sheep standing there
waiting to be slaughtered. Our Government is taking the necessary steps to
protect the population. It just takes time. It's easy to say in hindsight we
should have been prepared. No one suspected they would do what they did.
They may come up with other things to try that we haven't thought up yet
either and all we can do is react to that.

That's not quite true. At no point in history has anyone tried to take the
fight to the terrorists. This will be a first not only because of that fact
but because of the fact we are not alone in this fight. The vast majority of
the world is also behind this. You cut their funding and you cut their
training camps and countries willing to support them and see how long they
can last. It's going to take years to be sure but the outcome is clear. This
is afterall a war. We can expect casualties. It might get worse before it
gets better.

There is no vaccine against Anthrax. At least not one that works reliably.
Again, it's easy to say we had a lack of foresight when we never imagined
this could happen. Did you ever think this could happen? I certainly didn't.

Smallpox has indeed been eradicated but some Governments still keep the
strain around so it's conceivable this could fall into the wrong hands. And
it only has a 30% mortality rate, hardly the doomsday plague you make it out
to be. I'm not saying to ignore this threat but I think you're blowing this
a bit out of proportion.

Unfortunately, by the time you realize you're under chemical attack it's
already too late. Especially with nerve gas. You litterally have seconds to
react so unless you carry your gas mask and atropine injector on your person
at all times don't sweat it. Gas masks only protect against chemical attack,
not biological so again, unless you carry it around with you it's pointless.
Also, unless you sit at home and have sentries posted at every window
looking for gas clouds (which only a few chemical attacks produce. Most are
colorless anyway) you'll never know it's coming until you start twitching
and then it's too late.

Wrong. 100 meters is about 60 feet. You simply cannot get a chemical agent
to for a cloud that big. It dissipates too quickly. 60 feet is attainable
but not 60 miles. Unless of course you're talking about a nuclear threat and
even then that's not realistic.

That's simply not true. All terrorist organizations combined have fewer than
10,000 members. You say not to panic yet you grossly overemphasize the
threat and use inflamatory comments aimed directly at panicing people.

I disagree and the only reason I'm posting is to keep things in perspective.
I served 20 years in the military. I'm well aware of what chemical and
biological weapons can do. They're frightening but not the doomsday machine
you're painting them to be. I'm not saying do nothing but there's no need to
take things to the extreme either. Be prepared but not fanatic.
