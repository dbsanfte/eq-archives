Only more so, since the power players wouldn't bother waiting on his
boney 3 to 5 day spawn ass, so instead of 70 people waiting on his
pop you'd only have a dozen or two.

I got on the list at 54.  At that level, Ragefire might have been a
difficult fight... not impossible, but at least interesting.  I took
time off to level a bard to 40, and leveled up to 60 (thru 2 hells,
thanks so much for waiting till I was thru to eliminate them)
and have been 60 for what, a month now?  I've killed Ragefire
three times for other people, and strongly suspect that I could
assemble a single group to do it with... and I'm a looooong
way from uber.  Yet I won't see that epic till next January unless
a bolt of lightning strikes the current guy on the list and he misses
his 3 hour window.

At this point I could go back and do the rest of the epic in
three days, half solo, half with one or two groups, for a level
60 this isn't "epic" at all.  What it is is bottlenecked beyond
belief.  I'd far rather have to kill a level 65 dragon with no
wait list than wait incessantly for my shot at a puny Naggy clone
which won't come for months.
