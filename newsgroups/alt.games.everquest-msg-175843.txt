Speaking as an experienced druid, I do, when on luclin. The mobs seem immune
to snare and root, and they can root *you*. Wolfform is kos basically
everywhere, don't ask me why, and a tank becomes really important. I think a
lot of luclin is a reaction against the druid paradise that is the old
world.

I'd like to know if it's possible to solo in PoP. Even in small groups, i
found the mobs unmanageable, even the rats in PoD at 52, especially with the
adds warping in.
