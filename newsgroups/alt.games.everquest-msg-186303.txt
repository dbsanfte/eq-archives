I did. When I first got the game, I blew off the tutorial and went straight
into EQ. Had a *horrible* time. Showed up in Halas, at night. Couldn't see
anything. Hailed some guards, but by the time I'd type in something to say
to them, they'd wandered off in the inky night. Fell into the well, got
out. Wandered around in the pitch darkness. Went into an inn. Begged at a
merchant and was killed. Boy, was it an unpleasant experience.

Then did the tutorial. That helped a lot. Even though I only got as far
as the bit about scribing and memming spells before it crashed. Taught the
basics of combat, spells, banks, hailing people, swimming, navigating,
equipping, and buying stuff from merchants. All in a safe environment.

I've been quite disappointed that they quit supporting the tutorial a while
back. Especially since the way they fixed bringing newbies up to speed
(faster levelling 1-10) seems to cause more problems than it solves, IMO.
I've heard that the froggie city has something much like tutorial quests
built in, but I haven't checked them out yet.
