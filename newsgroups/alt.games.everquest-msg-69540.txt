The wait on the teleport up can be as long as the wait on a boat unless
you're timing is either lucky or good, then when you get there you usually
have to wait another 20 minutes or so to get back down to Norrath. The
announcements say the tp's activate every 15 minutes; but my timing of it
says it's closer to every 22 minutes. So to go from g'fay to toxx, you
could easily be looking at 45 minutes of travel time. Less time than
running and boats would take, certainly; but I suspect plenty of people
will still prefer to bug wizzies and druids for a direct port, rather than
go that route. .  .
