Ditto, ditto, ditto.

That's why I support fully funding the VA, so the injured vets can
get the medical care they need after they've made huge sacrifices.
That's why I also support military action only when it's absolutely
necessary (I hate seeing our troops put in danger) and I also support
limited tours of duty (so they come home sooner).

I wish George W. Bush supported the troops.  He seems to have
forgotten about them by pulling such nonsense as underfunding the VA,
fighting unjustified and unnecessary wars, and screwing over our
troops by making them stay in danger much longer than they should.

Please don't read me as a weak kneed pacifist who thinks war should
always be avoided: I fully supported our military actions in places like
Afghanistan.  But this whole Iraq thing....such nonsense.  Bush is
only willing to act tough when it's not him or his family in danger.
