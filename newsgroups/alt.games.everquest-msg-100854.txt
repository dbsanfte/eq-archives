Do you really believe this?

If Verant's only interest was making more money they would have raised
the price to $12.95 and never bothered with the legends server.

Legends a marketing test/tool not a money grab. It will give SOE/VI a
better understanding about what players want and how much they are
willing to pay for it.

Legends has nothing to do with the increase to the monthly
subscription fee.
