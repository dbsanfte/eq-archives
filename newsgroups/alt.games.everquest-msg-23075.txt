www.thesafehouse.org has a good article on the use of sneak/hide.

Brief answer to your question is that ANY mob has a chance to see thru sneak
hide.  Better chance with a higher mob.  I snuck deep into mistmoore at
level 20 with deep reds all around me without any problems but I have been
seen by a yellow goblins in HHK before too.   Some mobs will always see
through sneak/hide if you're in front of them.  Vampire bats, Lynada in sol
a, Froglok Assassin, Evileyes and Dragons are some.  I've just started
exploring velious and have notices some of the mobs (some shardwurms) con
scowling when i sneak through.

Note, sneak hide will aways work if you can stay behind a mob.( heck, sneak
alone will work in that situation).  Also, Ive found that the shorter the
time you spend in the area and the faster you pass by, the more likely a mob
wont see you.

Hope this helps.

PS  if you loot a corpse, have spells cast on you, or deal with a merchant,
you will loose sneak/hide without realizing it.  Many a "DOH!" from me on
that one.
