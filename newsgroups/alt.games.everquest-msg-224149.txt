Why is the weapon so cheap?  I don't monitor prices much and try to get most of
my equipment on my own but I was able to purchase one of these in the bazaar
for 10 plat on my server. It wasn't an anomaly either because there must've
been about 15 of them for sale and while this one was the cheapest there were
plenty of others for not much more.  They giving these things away in POJ or
what?
