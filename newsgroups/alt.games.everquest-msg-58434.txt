Everything you need to know right now can be found on www.eqtraders.com - 
follow the 'learn a skill' and then 'jewelcraft' links, and then check out 
in particular the step by step guide to jewelcraft (useful info, 
particularly on what you can sell and for how much). There is also a good 
trivial list on the Tal Kor Jewelry Academy section of the site.

eq.castersrealm.com is perhaps more comprehensive, particularly for getting 
price info on higher end stuff, but it's harder to navigate, since you end 
up doing a database query for each and every item you want to check out.
