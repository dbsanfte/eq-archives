Ok will you take a little advice from someone who who made the same
mistake you are making, two years ago?

Never, ever, ever buy equipment off NPC merchants.  Let me put this in
perspective.  Pretend that you can buy a piece of armor for say, 500
plat.  A comparable piece of armor in the bazaar would sell for 1 to 5
plat, if anyone even bothered selling it.  For your 500 plat, you
would get several times the AC and other stats buying bazaar gear for
the same slot as you would buying off of NPC merchants.  If you can't
scrounge up that much, which you havent done yet (don't worry, you
will later on) you can still find much better gear off other players
or in the bazaar for around 5 or 10 plat.

Here's the thing.  Those NPC merchant prices were set long ago, most
of them probably are the same prices charged by NPC merchants in 1999.
 In 1999, banded armor was "uber".  And even in 1999, Verant wanted to
make sure that merchants were over priced, to encourage the p2p
economy.  So you are basically paying a 1999 premium price for your
armor when you buy off the NPCs.  The introduction of 7 expansions
since then has made that armor worth almost nothing to most players,
as there is other armor that is much, much, much better, which drops
so often that people can't give it away.  I would guestimate that
these days, you are probably over-paying for your gear by about 1,000%
to 10,000% when you buy from the NPCs.
