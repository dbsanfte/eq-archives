Nodrop should just mean you cant give to other players.  If you really
couldnt give it to him then its a bug.  You should bug it.  Not sure if its
worth a petition though since you can make another one easily enough.  But
actually I suspect you mishandled the giving.  Maybe the game thought you
were trying to drop it on the ground.
