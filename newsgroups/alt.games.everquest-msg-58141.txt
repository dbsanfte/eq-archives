My apologies for top posting. No other new comments added below.
Thanks for saving me the trouble of answering the latest unfathomable
statements, Orlun. But to keep this post on a useful keel, the original
question posed was whether or not a successful taunt will put you "one
point above anyone else on the hate list" or not. Certainly a valid and
useful question to address here, particularly for all the tank types
with taunt skill. Martin himself pointed out that one possibility was:

And that's in fact that case. Taunt doesnt' work every time. When it
does, it raises you up the hate list. But not automatically to the top,
by one point or otherwise. I've seen you backstab a bit too effectively
and when evade fails a few times, I'd have to taunt more than once to
get back on top. 
  The second point being that certain mobs *will* let you know when you
successfully taunt them. And they use the phrase quoted. If you fail,
they say nothing. Even works for pets. When old Jabober is taunting a
derv in W. Commons, they periodically shout out the old, "I'll teach you
to interfere with me, Jabober00!"  Pretty amusing. Of course, they don't
stop beating on me even when he's taunting successfully all the way, but
it's still entertaining.
  Anyway, that's what I can offer about taunt for the person with the
orginal question, and I hope it's correct. And that is the essence of
this particular leg of this thread.
