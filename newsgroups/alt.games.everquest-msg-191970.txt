You could always contact BellSouth and buy 2 extra IP addresses from
them... It won't cost too much a month and is the absolute easiest way
to network. But there are more elegant solutions out there. 

For example... A decent Cable/DSL router is a good solution. UNLESS
your DSL is the kind that you have to click an icon to connect with.
That calls for you getting with Bell South and getting everything set
up correctly.

Otherwise, you can use the WinXP PC and internet sharing...

Finally, there are 3rd party apps that allow you to share internet
connections. 

This isn't a howto, just a summary of options!

Good Luck!
