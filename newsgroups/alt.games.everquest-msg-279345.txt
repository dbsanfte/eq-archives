That was the point. Many busy golf courses won't let you solo either! 
They'll pair you up with other 'soloers' pairs or fill out a threesome. 

Of course that wouldn't do you much good if every group you were 
assigned to refused to golf with you. Which is when the system breaks 
down.

I think the "If" in that last phrase is misplaced. I've yet to meet 
anyone ever who ever wanted something else.

And the issue is that that gear level is being described as beyond what 
tanks can get in 1-groupable content. (Or at least more than that is 
demanded of them, even though it can be done with less)

Which is another sore point. The enchanter can't solo there, and nobody 
wants to group with them there.

DoN isn't enough. It might be numerically enough to beat the mechanics 
of RSS but it isn't enough to jump the hurdle of getting accepted into a 
group in the first place. At least that seems to be a reasonable 
estimate of the consensus.

Except that we all know if you've got the gear that will overcome your 
social deficiencies.

I hear what your saying and agree. The issue isn't gear-gap per se, its 
a social problem. But I'm not seeing solutions or even partial solutions 
to that problem other than the (bad idea) of totally eliminating the 
gear gap. 

(Although I'm still all for raid gear that scales up but just on raids)
