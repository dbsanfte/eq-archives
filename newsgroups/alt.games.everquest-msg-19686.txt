I had a small battles against the goods at perma/everfrost. About 7 of
us held perma until goods attacked a second time and trained half the
zone on us (after we beat off their superior numbers first time).

Given that with superior numbers they can train more, I just went and
pk'd all their newbies for a few hours as punishment.
