    That's not the point. If it's farmed by one high level character, it's
eating 100 man-hours to satisfy the demand. If it takes a crew of six
non-stop camping, it takes 600 man-hours. There's only so many man-hours on
a server that can be used on item camps, so camps will sit unutilized and
number of items will decrease.

    Note that others don't. Like farmers. They like it for some reason I
can't fathom - perhaps they value the items they purchase with the cash more
than I ever could? But the fact is, they MUST like it in some way as they
have more alternatives than someone lower-level, yet still choose this
activity.

    See above. I'm not sure that a farmer thinks camping sucks. Which is why
I let him farm, and I buy what I need.

    See the man-hours argument above. It would be easy for me to log onto my
server at 2200 people online (a good peak population number), and get my
druid friend to go from zone to zone, seeing what item camps were being
farmed. I'm willing to bet we'd find many old world camps, and most
new-world camps, open. If nobody is there now, despite item quality (and
I'll drone on about all the awesome items that stay uncamped if given half a
chance), then when only level-appropriate characters can camp them it'll get
worse. Players will madly try and figure out a "best gear path", and stick
to those camps and those camps alone.

    I don't see that as a bad thing. The level of difficulty in such a game
can be slowly ramped upwards without destroying new players in such an
economy, because the new players have ready access to gear above what they
could camp themselves. If forced to keep game difficulty constant, twinks
would steamroll over new content with as much ease as they blow away
old-world encounters.

    And as I noted above, there's only a finite number of people available
to camp items. The assumption that *someone* will be camping a given item of
value isn't going to be true.

    I'd rather try and improve something I obviously enjoy on the whole
rather than start fresh somewhere else. Must be that damned "nurturing"
mechanic in games like EQ. ;-)

    It's relevant to the global point, having a fun game. Think about the
"doomsday" scenario I've presented: players packed into the few "good camps"
like rats, fighting over every overvalued drop. Players exploring new
content when it comes out only to be crushed by zone bugs, and forced to
waste ANOTHER night waiting for the GM to pull them out. Players
accumulating plat only to find items are trade only, and plat is good only
for merchant items. It's not pleasant. Will it ever be like this? Not on
servers now - too many items are already in circulation. But it sure would
mess with, say, a roleplaying server with TCC.

    Why was it corrected, Lokari? A low-level player (which, when Kunark
came out, would have been a pre-Dragons player) would never have known that
those goos HAD Vox's breath weapon, having never seen it before. All they'd
know is they went somewhere new in this expansion that goes up to level 60,
and got wiped before they could even /con. High-levels went in (and the
person that got me into the game was one of them, witnessed perhaps the
first drop of a Necklace of Superiority) and lived long enough to /con the
mobs and realize that something was out of whack. And THEN they went to
Whineplay and brought it up.

    High-level players are some of the best unintentional beta testers
around - make use of them!

    That's even worse. Entire game areas that one should never experience?
Do those areas tell no stories that I want to hear, have no plotlines that I
want to take part in? Using an ooc device like level limits destroys willing
suspension of disbelief.

    There are mobs he CAN kill there. There's what looks like three zone
connection points there - in the near future, this could be a stepping stone
to other, higher level zones. He could simply be a faction nut - some
players like maxing faction as many places as possible, as a challenge. He
could just be an EQ tourist, someone that loves going to different zones and
seeing how much of a challenge they would be to their alts (and how much
reward they can expect if they go there). Saying "this zone is green,
therefore nothing here should ever interest you" makes it seem as though the
ONLY point to EQ is levelling up, doesn't it?

    I was killing stuff there at 42 that was blue. At 40 there'd be a pretty
good flow of blues from what I saw, especially in areas like up near the
waterfall. A level 40 player in Stonebrunt would be shut out of almost all
the Kejekan quests.

    You offered the idea that a quest giver should only offer quests to
people of "the appropriate level". I pointed out the difficulty of
determining what "the appropriate level" might be if such an idea were
implemented. This was one of my examples of a quest that can't be classified
so easily.
