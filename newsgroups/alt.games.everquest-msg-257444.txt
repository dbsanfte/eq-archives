It was our 3d Ldon with the same group in a row,and I was
becoming a little sleepy,not paying as much attention as
I should,and being corrupted by never loosing an (easy)
adventure.
Group was Enc,Bst,Dru,SK,Rng,Cle(me), the usual collect.
Camp was North Ro.
Adventure 1 and 2 this evening were very easy,both finished
in 45 minutes,Rng was level 58 and I noticed him critting a 
lot so he must have spent  a bunch of AAs for his level,he
had epic too and this 625 damge proc sword,he did a very
nice job,never stealing aggro from the SK,put him on 
friends list ,a very valuable group member.So he was our
prime dps source...
Too bad he went linkdead and never came back,just when
 I got our 3d adv from the recruiter.
Ok,we finished a lot of adventures with only 5 or even 4
members,so this shouldnt be a problem.
From zone in we saw a big room with 3 of these spirtstorm
thingies,nice LoS,easy to pacify for me,I targetted one of them,
pressed my Pacify hotbutton(Group message in line 1,cast 6
in line 2),WtF they were coming all ? Oops,had nuke in 
spell slot 6 instead of pacify :).Decided to call zone,cause we
were at the entrance,all zoned out...except Chanter,who has
used area mez without announcing it and of course mezzing
himself too.... dead Enchanter.
No big deal,will cost us maybe 2 or 3 minutes to res him,but
where is his corpse ? No corpse to see,and we didnt move 
a step from zone in,after some clicking around I remember
/tar command and found corpse,ressed him,buffed him up,told
him to med up,we can do without him for a while.So 10 minutes
gone without  a single kill.
After 45 minutes we had 13 of 26 items collected,so we were 
clearly make up from the incident at the beginning.
But from now on it became ugly,room after room the SK puller
opened the door to,we nearly got the full room,no chance to
pacify,but Chanter was very good in mezzing all the adds,though
it cost me a lot of not very mana-effective fast heals,slowly draining
my mana,I was relying on C2,should be good enough,only 3 mana
less than Kei and I am at FT6.
Druid keeps draining my mana for heals too by snaring mobs on inc,
nice.I needed several med breaks,my usual partners gave me the nick
name Mr.FM,though its not my merit,they are all pretty capable
players,saves me a lot of heals.
So its getting later and later,its 0.45 am,I am getting more and more
sleepy,paying less attention to what happens.
Druid dies,while I am happily healing the mob without noticing it.
Sk dies while I am happily healing his pet without noticing it.
Bst dies while I am happily fast healing the full health SK without
noticing it.
15 minutes left,only 6 of 26 to go,now we get hit by EQ's RNG.
9 minutes left,still 6 of 26.
6 minutes left,still 6 of 26...so its clear we wont make it.
2 minutes left, 5 of 26 left,WtF is up with the drop rate ???

...You have failed your adventure....   =(

It was obviously the Cleric's fault,I hope not too much of
the group put him on the "never group again with" list.  :)

It was not all bad,loot was unbeleivable good,lot of
gem drops,split was 263p each,2 Int,1 Str,1 Dex and
1 Agi augment dropped,not counting the resist augs.

Hm,xp,not sure what to think of this,got 4 blues from
3 adventures,fine for me,I already have a 65 Char and
doing Ldons with cleric is just for fun,I have no desire
to level the fastest possible way.But my SK friend is 
not very happy with this kind of xp,being a true "Newbie"
he wants level 65 yesterday :),understandable.

Last thing to mention are treasure Barrels,this guy in a 
thread some weeks ago talking about leaving the group
when someone touches them made me curious,so I bought
the appropriate spells,saw around 10 treasure chests since
I have the spells and only on one my spells did work.
So my SK friend says why not simply break them,oooohh 
no ,bad idea,I read a lot of how bad the traps are on the chests,
and how they kill the whole party in an instant,but finally give
it a try.
I found traps are really bad,the initial explosion does several
100 points of damage and the poison dot does several 100
points of damage per tick,but its possible for me to keep
the party alive with pure blood and group heals memmed.
Key is the right sequence whom to heal,start with cleric :),
then care for the robe wearers and wis casters,tank types
last.
Loot I saw from chests ranges from gems,illusion potions to
a +10 mana item.The enchanter in my group swears he saw
a FT1 item coming from a chest in a normal mid50s adventure,
though I have my doubts.

Yeah,its patch day and I have a lot of time,hope I didnt bore
you too much,I apologize for the length of the post.  :)
