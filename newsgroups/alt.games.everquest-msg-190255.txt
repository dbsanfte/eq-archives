Just what Ive been saying, all this penis err class envy has just
about killed the fun in EQ. Der Furer did cause the monk nerf, without
his whining it would never have happened. Every time it happens the
game dies a bit. Heck you want balence then every Caster in the game
needs serious nerfing...better yet just do away with melees.
