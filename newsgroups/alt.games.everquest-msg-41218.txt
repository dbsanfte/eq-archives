TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES
   This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.

America: The Good Neighbor.

Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a
remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a
Canadian television commentator.  What follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:
"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the
most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the
earth.
Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted
out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of
dollars and forgave other billions in debts.  None of these countries
is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United
States.
When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the
Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and
swindled on the streets of Paris.  I was there.  I saw it.
When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that
hurries in to help.  This spring, 59 American communities were
flattened by tornadoes.
Nobody helped.

The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars
into discouraged countries.  Now newspapers in those countries are
writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.
I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the
erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane.  Does any
other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet,
the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas 10?  If so, why don't they fly
them?
Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes?

Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman
on the moon?  You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.
You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon, not
once, but several times and safely home again.

You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the
store window for everybody to look at.  Even their draft-dodgers are
not pursued and hounded.  They are here on our streets, and most of
them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American
dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.

When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down
through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them.  When the
Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody
loaned them an old caboose.
Both are still broke.

I can name you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help of
other people in trouble.  Can you name me even one time when someone
else raced to the Americans in trouble?  I don't think there was
outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.  Our neighbors
have faced it alone, and  I'm one Canadian who is damned tired of
hearing them get kicked around.

They will come out of this thing with their flag high.  And when they
do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are
gloating over their present troubles.  I hope Canada is not one of
those."

Stand proud, Americans!
