Erm why exactly I merely asked for help and for some the act of helping out
a fellow player is enough. I know it is for me I have helped many with the
parts I know about. killing corrupted mobs when mana is low for others,
helping them plan and kill the dark elf corrupter. or are you maybe
suggesting I should put some PP down? which is a thought for a guild are
there any in existence that act as mercenaries? If so I would have thought
they ask for a lot of PP

That can be a little difficult he spawns 1 day after venril sathir is killed
so unless I was privvy to info about guilds taking him down then I would not
know for certain until i zoned in and checked track ( which i do often)
