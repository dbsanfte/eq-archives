Your right.  I just posted this right after it happened because I was
seriously pissed.  Hehe, I am even kind of excited when I think about the
fact that my 43 Iksar Monk actually survived an encounter that according to
the posts on Alakhazam, has wiped groups with levels 60+.  The only actual
hit that the Fabled Kobold Noble landed on me was a crushing blow for 555
points.
