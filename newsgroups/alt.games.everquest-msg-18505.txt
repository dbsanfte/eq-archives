Hello,

Yes you can change your screen resolution. Here's how:

On the left hand side of your screen click "options"
Then click "general"
then click "display"

You should see the current resolution ( probably 640 x 480 ) here. Click on
it and it will go up by one ( i.e to 800 x 600 ) repeat the process to get
the desired resolution.

This is from memory so may not be exact but I hope it helps!
