They definately should be healed when FD.  In fact the ideal
arrangement would be to never ever heal a monk who isn't
FD, unless he's MA (or off tanking SA)  Every time you heal
anyone, you get higher up the aggro list of every mob that
hates the person you heal.  A FD monk is on noone's hate
list, even if he does go back on the (they remember?) lists
when he stands up, for some mobs.  Healing a puller monk
who isn't FD can wipe a raid.  From a practical standpoint,
in a small group environment, usually waiting until the adds are
all mezed and the MA has the taunt is fine, and simpler than
insisting on FD for every monk heal... the game can be forgiving
of a little sloppiness in easily controlled situations.

This is so important that I've often convinced RLs to pair me with
a monk, and order everyone else to not ever heal him.  I heal
ONLY on demand, and the monk ONLY asks for a heal while
FD.  It was hard at first to watch monks die with me having the
responsibility of healing them... but having seen whole raids wiped
by a poorly timed heal, I've become innured to the occaisional
loss of puller, proud of it even, given what that death probably
represents.
