Looked at this thread, and there were no details as to precisely what 
the nerf will be.

One poster speculated that it might only apply to Rathe's Son.

But looking specifically at the only official word I see in the entire 
thread:

  I have received confirmation that this change is indeed going live. 
The spell was not meant to return more mana than was spent casting the pet.

It seems clear that it will work on all pet canni; the entire point of 
pet canni is that you -do- get more mana back killing a pet than you 
spend casting him.

Wait, here's the entire post:

Hello all,

I have received confirmation that this change is indeed going live. The 
spell was not meant to return more mana than was spent casting the pet.

Sorry for the short notice on this. I will try to give more advance 
warning on these sorts of changes in the future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Thats got to be one of the worst posts I've seen made, this new guy 
seems a complete ass.

We are shooting your grandmother in the head today.

Sorry about the short notice.

Details man, details... and I'd suggest some discussion before bringing 
out a change of this magnitude.

But thats just me.
