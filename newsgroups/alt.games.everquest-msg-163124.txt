well,I finally got to lv 52 thanks to jagged pine (even got to dubious with
iksar monk; so can he go shopping in SFG? The mind boggles) and I've been
hoping the darkpaws won't turn light blue for a long time, but i don't have
any AA points. I'd really rather keep levelling as early AA is a bit dull
(later AA looks fantastic tho!) but i'm worried that I'd end up getting AA
slower than at the moment due to the xp penalties from lt blues as you rise
in level.


From a min-max viewpoint, should i get AA now or later, when i have to go to
some nasty dungeon and forget about two-boxing for the rest of my characters
life, or are there high level  zones my characters can farm AA efficiently
at 60? Jaggedpine seems so easy compared to the dungeon zones (acrylia mines
was nasty, think you need a full group, even if the mobs are lt blue to you)
or Ten. Mountains, where everything aggros, sees thru invis (or is invis)
and may drop A Crappy Weapon (TM) after rooting you as you run from a huge
train.. and may even be completely green.

Actually that reminds me of befallen, where the entire zone seemed to aggro
on my druid, who was clicky snare/dotting as fast as he could but still had
to run for it, all because he sat down to med....
