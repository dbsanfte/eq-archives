From what I recall of what they said of their player base it was average
player played a main of level 30 to 50.
Had ***No*** characters level 65 or over 50 for that matter and their alts
were under level 20.

Much different "data" than your own playing 3 mains 65 or higher with alts
30 to 50....

With out actually seeing the numbers it doesn't really matter but apparently
having a 65 toon is not the norm.

I assume the drive to add high level content is due to the fact that is the
long time core paying player base.
Someone with a dozen 65 toons and a bazillion AA's has far more invested and
interest and probability of continuing to pay than a casual get to level 30
and quit player.
