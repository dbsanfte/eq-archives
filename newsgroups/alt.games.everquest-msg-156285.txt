If you have an enchanter, its common practice to pull numerous mobs in and
keep them all mezzed, so the tanks never need to stop other than for low
mana on their healer or something.  "Pull, kill, wait for puller to get next
mob" is one plan, of course, but its far from the only one you can use.

I group a great deal with a druid friend who we refer to as the best mezzer
on our server.  She pulls in mobs in stacks of six or so, lines them up in
order of priority, and keeps them rooted while we go from one to the next.
When the stack of mobs starts to run low she's off pulling the next stack.
Why is this better than the mez plan?  Because by the time we get to each
mob, its already half dead from her no mana cost DOTs!

Another combat plan is known as AE group; your puller brings in mobs not a
piddly four or six at a time, but a dozen or more at a throw... and goes out
to get more each time things are under control.  Get 30 to 50 mobs packed in
real tight and then kill them all at once.  This requires enchanters for
chain AE stunning, and casters with "point blank" AE spells that will hit
50+ mobs at a time if they are all right next to them.

Point is, mobs that are under the control of someone who is capable of
killing them are no longer free game.  They may have a plan you never heard
of.  Or they may be in trouble.  But unless you see an ooc/shout/tell to
that effect, or a /y, assume they have those mobs there on purpose for
whatever reason.  Course once they all die from overestimating their
capabilities, you can walk in, kill their already wounded mobs, loot up, and
then give them a rez on the house... but thats just me.
