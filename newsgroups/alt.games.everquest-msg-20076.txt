Nope.
Doesn't work, wouldn't recommend it infact.
Stun Breath (the name of the spell she uses) is an AoE version of the
same thing that Zlandicar procs when he slaps you.  900hps DD and 12
seconds of standing around looking really stupid not able to do
anything.

Generally with an MR of over 220 at level 60, you can resist most of
her AoEs--about 1 in 4 will get through.
