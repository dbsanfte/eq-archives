Another thing to consider is that you aren't your character.  In a game 
like EQ or WoW, you character is someone who has grown up in that world, 
and presumably has trained from an early age for his life as an 
adventurer.  *You* may have trouble keeping track of directions when 
running across a zone, but your character would not, and so having an 
aid like a direction arrow on the map is simply something that enables 
you to properly role-play your character.
