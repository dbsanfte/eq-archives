Nope. 

You may as well as if there should be a mystical portal to Horizons,
Shadowbane or World of warcraft. They are two totally different games
with two totally different game systems.

The thing they thought they might do, which is the same basically, is
letting you reserve the name that your EQ character has for EQ2.

Totally different game/item system.

You are not "starting over", its a totally new game. It just happens
to take place in the world of EQ. What you are saying is as silly as
someone saying the same thing about EQ online adventures. The fact it
takes place on the PS2 is not why there is no crossover, it is a
totally different game.
