Its not bad as a primary to do 1 hand slash on a large race Sk (troll
or ogre) with an ass load of stamina but its not very good even on an
ogre dual wielding.

Dual wielding takes sta, which is why warriors using it want smaller
faster lighter weapons with very low ratios. The wurmy weighs FREAKING
15! that is like the weight of a large 2 hand weapon.

My troll sk likes hers when she is not using her moss or velium war
lance, drakkel icegrinder, argent defender, etc. I don't feel like
shelling out the cash for a noct blade so wurmy is still fun at 35 to
keep up one hand slash.

Dual wielding I'd tell you to buy almost any similar cheap weapons. A
smoldering brand, for example,  which is 22 spd 9 dam and procs a 14
damage dd costs about what a wurmy does on my server ( 2k or less) and
would be far better for you in either hand (no idea what shimmering
partisan is)
