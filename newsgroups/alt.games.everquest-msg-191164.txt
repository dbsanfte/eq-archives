To quote you: "Oh, right, nobody reads manuals anymore."  You sounds
like a bitch to me.  The guy just tried to give some helpful advice
that many are not aware of and you try to turn it into a flame on the

surprise me if the effect of your message would be to make the good
samaritan wonder why he even bothered.  That's my problem.
