Hm. I'd venture that a good 99% of soloers aren't roleplayers. They solo 
because they don't have a lot of play time and can't be bothered to look 
for groups, or because solo xp is faster, or simply because they don't 
feel much like socializing.

As you said, Sony aren't nerfing soloing, they are nerfing "soloing + 
mad xp". The true roleplayers who are bent on roleplaying a lone wolf 
can still do so as until now (except perhaps in PoP), *and* they will 
save money on the new expansion.

And don't get me wrong, I've soloed perhaps 99% of my time online, so I 
totally sympathize with soloers everywhere. It's just that I've seen the 
writing on the wall, and rather than moaning, I'm trying to learn to be 
a good group player. Not easy, but I managed to keep alive a group of 
low-level melees apparently made of wet paper in PoN yesterday, so 
perhaps there is still hope for me.
