True. If they didn't, I'd say most of us would be gone.

I'm actually all for bashing Verant when they deserve it (which, even
with their quality product is too often). All that I ask of the basher
is that he state his case clearly and back it up with facts, or at
least reasoned arguments.

It's the whiners (verant sucks!!11) that make my teeth itch.
