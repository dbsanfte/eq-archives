The trick is to have the FPS set down low enough so that the background task 
gets enough cpu time.
Then yu can set them both to autorun, or /follow and you wont get "lagged" 
on your background char.

If im getting say 50 fps max with 1 char, then id use 25 fps max when 2 
boxing, so then they both run at 25 fps.

Why the inbuilt system is broken, and we need wineq to make the timeslicing 
work correctly is a mystery to me.
