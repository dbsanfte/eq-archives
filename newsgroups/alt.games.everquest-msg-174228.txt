Wrong. I have seen ZERO evidence that Iraq was involved in September
11th. The government of the most powerful nation on earth would kill
for that kind of evidence, but have still failed to produce the goods.
Hmmm.

Wrong...it was an amusing (to me anyway) riposte to your comment about
my ignorance, made possible by YOUR willful ignorance of world
affairs.

Whatever.

Just for fun I dredged up your post that I snipped, just to give it
the once over again.

International economics is not all about buying and selling.

Because recently Saddam has started cutting off Oill supplies,
therefore driving world oil prices up. So basically, your premise is
shite. SNIPPABLE.

Eh...you did. 
Check your recent history of dealing with Saddam...particularly around
the time he was gassing his own people.
This was snipped for your own benefit...I was trying to hide your
TOTAL ignorance so you could keep some dignity.

No...they arent "intertwined". Explain how, without jumping from Sept

The act of rebuttal requires a preceding item to rebutt.

Hahaha. 
Studies have shown that the public health systems in Cuba, Canada and
China are far superior to that of the US.
Of course, the US healthcare system may be better than Mexico's.

Oh man...you really missed a lot of stuff in the last few decades

Sorry, but I dont have time to fill you in on agressive american
interference in other nations politics under the headings of "Fighting

Why do you persist in relying on strutting and sneering then?

Allowing Saddam to do what he wants would be de-stabilising for the
world Oil economy. He has already cut of supply in protest at the
treatment of the Palestinians. This would put the US in a very
uncomfortable situation, either stop supporting Israel, or allow
oil-prices to rise, and allow them to be set by Saddam, someone who
has shown that he does not like the US.

You need to start putting 2 and 2 together Dan.

Where were your principles and ideals when you were dealing with the

these priniciples and ideals only been brought in with the Dubya
administration?
Laughable.

You are one of the few countries with the ability to do something
about it, agreed, but this is not a reason for going in "Because we
can!"

So its some good reason, but not oil...ok we are boiling it down now.

I agree, I think our governments have wussed out on the issue of
confronting the US on this issue.

I have rebutted your comments, the few that actually made any kind of
sense. It still leaves the question open, why is the US going after
Iraq when there are states WHO ARE KNOWN TO SPONSOR TERRORISM in other
areas of the globe?
This is not a straw-man, this is a very important question YOU should
ask yourself about what your country is doing.
