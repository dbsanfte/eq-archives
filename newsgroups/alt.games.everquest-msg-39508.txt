Oh, man, I'm right there with you, brother.  I dunno if I'll quit if 
forced to be seen as a DeVito, but I'll probably end up retiring my main, 
which would be sad. :( Unless they'll let me change my last name to Fudd.

There's one other issue with the TCC.  It's biased against enchanters.  
Sure, all you druids and necros can go out there and solo a yellow/low 
red.  I can barely solo something low blue/high green.  (Yes, there's 
exceptions in situations where I can use charm... There just aren't that 
many of those situations, though.  And on top of that, I suck at it.)  So 
by the time I can solo it without getting my ass handed to me, it's 
already on the verge of being 'trivial'.

I've just now, at 44, reached the point where I feel I might have a shot 
at taking down the various Sand Giants in South Ro along with the ever 
elusive Ancient Cyclops.  I did manage to off a couple SGs yesterday, 
barely, with one bubb of health remaining.  And I did, once, spot the AC 
in the distance, but someone was already on it.  But it conned green...  
So I guess I should leave it for someone more 'level appropriate'?  What?
When was I _ever_ 'level appropriate' then?  

Or am I supposed to just go start a Wood Elf Druid like everyone else...

Anyway, The 50+ looking Rogue who was beating on it didn't seem too 
concerned by the issue.  As it should be.

My biggest objection to the TCC is that it's given us a whole new ball of 
wax for people to get on two sides of and whine about incessantly.  Bleah.
