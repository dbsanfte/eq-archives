Aego sucks.  Virtue sucks.  Symbol is da bomb.  Because Symbol stacks with POTC,
and neither Aego nor Virtue do.  For most mana using classes, the loss of HP
from Virtue to Kazad plus POTC is more than offset by the added mana regen
(necros and shaman may feel otherwise) unless serving as main tank (occaisional
paladins and shadowknights).

Group symbol of Marzin is one of those spells I've always wanted, sadly it seems
to be unobtanium.  The chimera of group Kazad hovers in front of my eyes;
something that with a bit of work (level up perhaps, get flag certainly) I can
hope to achieve without blowing massive quantities of raid points on some rare
drop off a boss mob I've never seen dead, far more likely than the group marzin
I now have practically no interest in.

I don't use the AOE stuns I have now, I doubt I'll be using this one either.  IF
they were PBAE stuns, yes, interesting.  But targetable, that means you hit max
of four mobs, and likely as not one of them is yourself!

I've only been in a few AE groups, but they were tons of fun and OUTRAGEOUSLY
effective.  I'd heal heal heal till the hammer dropped, and then pound out the
rest of my mana as fast as I could on Upheavals and Word of whatever it is.
Doing 35000 hp damage per cast is quite a feeling of power... although the
wizards and mages in your group are doubtless doing twice that, and refreshing
faster.  An upgrade that puts me back in the running might be interesting
indeed.

With BOR and a mage focus item, cast time on SL would be around 3 seconds, for
around 3K spot heal with a fairly nice ratio.

Elixer I do have, its very handy in PoP zones especially, as a really functional
HOT, solid enough to keep tanks alive long enough for the crowd control guy to
get the adds under control and the tank to aquire a good firm taunt and the
slower to get the target mob slowed; without it, you have to use a real heal and
bang, you get all the love.

exp mobs seem to be vanishing even at 63, what are you exping on at 65?
