I expect it to be.  If Jedi were universally the most fun and rewarding
class to play, then yes, everyone would want to be Jedi like you've been
saying.  But the point I'm trying to make is you're going to have to
*really* want to be Jedi to be willing to endure the difficulties of playing
the class.  I think what it'll come down to is that only the true RPers, and
the ones who want to RP a Jedi specifically, will end up being Jedi.  There
will be more than that who could become a Jedi if they wanted to but they
won't want to because Jedi have a hard life -- which, of course, is in
keeping with the Star Wars universe.

lol... well, hopefully I'm right and I'll see you there..
