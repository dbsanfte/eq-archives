Same here.  I took a peek on the test server and I don't like the new
version.  it's not as dark and gloomy as the old zone.  Looks more
like a tyical backyard swamp rather than a swamp next to the home of
troll's.

A lot of the zones had been revamped, broke many quest writeups, often
broke existing quests as well, and added a lot of lags.  All for the
sake of making the old world up to standards.

The way the revamped zones are spreading, upper/lower guk or feerott
could be next.

>Oh, and "pullulates"... is that a word?

Yep...  a new word for me but it's spelled correctly and is listed on
dictionary.com:

pul�lu�late       (pu(l'y?-la-t') 
intr.v.   pul�lu�lat�ed, pul�lu�lat�ing, pul�lu�lates

   1. To put forth sprouts or buds; germinate.
   2. To breed rapidly or abundantly.
   3. To teem; swarm: a lagoon that pullulated with tropical fish.
