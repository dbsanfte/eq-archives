When comparing clerics, druids, and shamans one sees that their defense 
skill cap is the same for all:  200.  The offense skill is another 
matter:  both druids and shamans have a cap of 200 while clerics get a 
cap of 175.  They are inferior in hand-to-hand combat than druids.

I suggest that to make things a little more honest about the game 
(everybody knows this stat cap is screwy -- ask anybody) that clerics 
get an offense skill cap of 200.  People can argue that clerics in a 
group setting should never melee but stare perpetually at their 
spellbook but a cleric has to break away from groups now and then 
otherwise they would go out of their mind.  Giving them a 200 cap would 
not make them feel like they were cheated in this area.

The whole game is about skill caps.

Verant needs to admit they made a big mistake in this area and fix it.

Take a vote:  "Should clerics be below druids in their melee skill?"
