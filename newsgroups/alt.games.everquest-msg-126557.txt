My sympathy to you and your friend.  You are obviously upset that your
guilds time was wasted on a quest
where they had no chance of winning against a larger guild that intruded on
your space.

One of the people responding mentioned that this is just a game (as if,
being a game, courtesy and honesty don't apply).

Games (any GOOD games) have rules of behaviour.  In games and real life, it
is annoying when those rules are violated,
especially when the culprit gets away with the prize as a result.  Your
server is not a PVP server, so having the bigger, tougher
guild should not be the issue.

I am surprised at the sound of the responses you got.  We have all been
KS'd, so why do we disbelieve that it happens to othes, or
why do we not sympathize?

Shrug!! its all you can do...  Hope your friend gets his epic.
