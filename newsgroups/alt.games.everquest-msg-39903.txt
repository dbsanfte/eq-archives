Ok, I admit it...it�s time I get new equipment.
Sadly, I�m clueless as to what to get, and what to pay for it.
(I haven�t been paying attention to auctions)

So...I would greatly appreciate some advice on what to get, and what to pay
for it.
Don�t care what it is, although mainly I need a new robe.
Int raising prefered.

Thanks in advance for whatever help you can offer. Even if it�s just the
address to a website with hints.
