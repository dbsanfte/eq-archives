I have the Luclin expansion but when I play, I only have the models for my
current character turned on (PC limitations).  Therefore, I do not get to
see all the new outfits that go with the Luclin models.

My high elf enchantress was given a Shardwurm Tunic by a friend and when she
puts it on...she looks FABULOUS!  It looks like a sheer black and gold,
off-the-shoulder gown.  Are there any other race/clothing combo's that look
really nice on the new models?
