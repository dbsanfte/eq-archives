You are diffusing the definition of survival of the fittest so much
that you are almost coming around full circle to agreement with me :)

If survival of the fittest means a nation who is willing to live
peacefully with its neighbors, carrying on trade and making treaties,
out of knowledge that peaceful coexistence is the best way to survive,
you are now quite a long way from DT's original statement:
