Good news for all W2k/SBLive sufferers. Over the weekend I upgraded to XP
Pro and viola! New SB Live drivers which work with EQ! For the first time in
over a year, I am playing with music on, and plenty of reverb and such in EC
tunnels et al.
Make sure you do a "Windows Update" after install, as there are even newer
drivers dated 10/11/01.
