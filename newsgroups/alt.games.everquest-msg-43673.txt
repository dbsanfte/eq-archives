Many people have found that practice research is a pain in the ass....even
moreso than simply trying to do real research.

Get a list of your spells that can be researched.  Practice creating spells
using the components that make spells  you can BUY, so that if you fail you
haven't really lost anything.  When your skill gets maxed, THEN attempt the
ones you MUST research.  Better yet, give the components and your Research
book to someone of the same class but much higher level and politely ask if
they'll combine it for you.  Obviously you'll ask if their research skill is
high first. :)

What *I* did was simply dump all my practice points into it each level.
That's the route you go if you're impatient like me. <g>
