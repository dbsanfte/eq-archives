Ok, I have noticed recently that alot of peeps have never grouped with
a Necro or a Bard before.  This may be due to the fact that they solo
so well, or in the past for necros they were not necessarily wanted in
a group (why I have no idea... love to have a necro in my group).

So, I started a list of What a class brings to the table for a group.

I included all classes, but I have not played all classes, and I only
have a few High level classes (highest to date is a 55 Monk, and 53
Cleric) so I am sure I am missing some abilities/skills.

Please help me make this list as complete as possible.
