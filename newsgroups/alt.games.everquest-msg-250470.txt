That is not even slightly what I am saying. Just because I think
that SOE condoning the practice would be bad, doesn't mean I
think that Yantis doing it is alright.

What SOE SHOULD do is work on ways to stop such sales
from taking place in the first place. Offering their own solution
IS throwing their hands up, by saying "we can't beat this, so
we might as well join them".
