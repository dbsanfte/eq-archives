I know this is a touchy subject so try to understand.  People often share
their passwords with 'friends' and guildies.  In addition, Ebayers will (and
often do), report their account stolen after the sale.

Yes, this happens.  It's unfortunate but it does.  I have witnessed it first
hand.

At first the person claims they were 'hacked'.  Upon further investigation
it is revealed they had shared their account with friends/roomates/guildies,
then the whole "but I only told one person my password" argument ensues.

I for one am glad they are *finally* cracking down on this.

Be smart...change your password frequently, don't share it with anyone.  Do
this and you will likely enjoy EQ <G>.
