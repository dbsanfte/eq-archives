This was your question;
>>>I don't see how, I can't imagine how a suicidal person can have an 
>>>enormous strength of character and will.. Please explain me how.. 

You asked for an example of when a suicide (or a
suicidal person) could show great strength of
character.

I gave you one. There are thousands more.

>and it's a completely different story than the poor EQ addict, 

As to what it had to with the EQ suicide story; it
is a rebuttal to the assertion that suicide =
irrational.

>and is also really extreme.

Of course its extreme... suicide is extreme.

Not at all. 

The rights or wrongs of a decision have no bearing
whatsoever, on its rationality. You can make an
irrational decision, that turns out to be right,
as you can make a rational decision that turns out
to be wrong.
