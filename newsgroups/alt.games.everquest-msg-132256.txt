Yeah, but I have to admit that even in xp groups I like to have at least
either a cleric or an enchanter or a bard along.  I find that healing,
slowing, and hasting can be just a tad too draining on my mana at times.  If
both a cleric and enchanter are in the group, I find on the other hand that
I don't have enough to do just slowing and buffing, so I also toss out a
nuke or two at times.
