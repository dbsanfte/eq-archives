So you're mad because you can't sell your services like a chanter, cleric 
or shaman? If your idea of playing a druid is running around whoring out 
your ports, then yeah, I suppose your class has been broken for you. I 
can't really say I feel too sorry for you though.

When considering whether a class is balanced or not, the thought of how 
much money they can make in PoK should never enter into the equation.
