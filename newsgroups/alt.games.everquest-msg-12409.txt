Unfortunately, you won't be able to do this in Velious.  Too many mobs
have too high a resistence to magic.  For example, if you can get slow
to stick on an Icewell Sentry, I would be amazed--it would be one of
those few very lowest level sentries which can be lifetapped and you
got REAL lucky on the resistence roll.

Nevertheless, your challenge was a warrior to solo something outside
of the old world.  Icewell Sentries qualify.  More importantly, it's a
mob shamans won't be able to solo.  Slow won't stick and the damage
output of pets and your dots won't be enough (especially since dorfs
are highly resistent to ice/poison/disease).

He can take a sentinel but he will be at near death and usually has to
resort to defensive at about 50% health.  If it's a dual weilding
Sentinel, forget it, he just zones them.
