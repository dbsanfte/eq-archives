I was in a group about a month ago that was quite a bit like the one you
describe above, also in KC.  It was me (wizard), a bard, 3 paladins, and
some other class I cannot recall ATM.  All were 50 plus.  Like your group,
ours killed at will.

One of the Paladins "went away" after a while because he was as stupid as
shit, wanted to boot the bard for an enchanter at one point (even though the
bard was leader), and kept bitching about loot.  Finally, he unceremoniously
left the group to get buffs somewhere, and when he came back, the leader had
(thankfully) found a replacement for him.

I have to say, the bard was what I think really made it work.  I cannot
remember ever being disappointed in a group that included a bard.  I'd hate
to ever play one, but I love playing *with* them.
