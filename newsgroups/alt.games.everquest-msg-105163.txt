I agree though, you didn't hold all variables constant.  Doing so with Beetmi
would be simple; you already have his naked combat results with a
defense of 20 at level 4, now suit him up and give us his armored
combat results, still at 20 defense and still at level 4.

Hmm, also his results at that same 160 AC value, since you have a data
point for that AC for him at level one.

Trouble with the way you did it is that defense and level both moved.  You
still provide interesting data, but it doesn't pinpoint where the confusion
lies, you went from a mob twice your level to one half your level, you changed
your defense 20 points and you changed your armor by -100 all at the same
time.  It -is- clear that AC made a difference in damage per hit, and it is
clear
that either level or raw defense skill made a substantial difference in
frequency
of hit... but its possible that AC -also- contributes to frequency of hit
(since
a drop in frequency there may have been masked by a sharp rise in frequency
from level or defense)

Data I've seen in the past also indicates a "plateau" type of curve in the
effectiveness of armor; up to a certain level it will provide no protection
to speak of, no difference say from zero to 100, then it will provide an
increasing amount of protection as it goes up for a while (say from 100 to
200) then it will level back off and there will be no increase in protection
(or very little) for any higher levels of armor.  The low end and high end
of those plateau's move based on the level of the mob versus the level
of the character.  I've always assumed this was due to the offense of the
mob, but your data hints that it may -really- be level based.

What the original data suggested, for me as a cleric, was that there was
probably no benefit to casting an AC buff on a caster, nor (oddly) on
main tanks if fighting blues, but a substantial benefit to casting it on semi
tanks such as rangers, where the AC boost was moving them in the
effective range.  Against light blues, effect would only be seen on the
casters, while against yellows or better, effect would only be seen
on plate class characters.  As the AC buff is actually quite mana intensive,
I'd love to have more information though.
