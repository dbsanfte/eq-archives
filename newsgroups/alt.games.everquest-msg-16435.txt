This is amazing and, in some ways, a little frightening.

             Where Does Fantasy End?
             Why all of South Korea is obsessed with an online game
where
             ordinary folks can be arms dealers, murderers ... and elves

             By MICHELLE LEVANDER Seoul

             Five rough-looking men
             stepped out of a black
             sedan and burst into the
             Seoul PC caf� where Paek
             Jung Yul hangs out with
             Strong People Blood
             Pledge, his clan of online
             gamers. "Is the wizard
             here?" demanded one of the
             toughs, asking for the player
             who killed his character in
             an online game called
             Lineage. The "wizard" was
             there, alright, and he was
             feeling bold. He boasted
             that he had offed the gangman's virtual character just for
the fun of it. Bad idea.
             The roughnecks dragged the 21-year-old into the urinal and
pummeled him until
             he was covered with real-world bruises.

             Paek describes the incident�now part of his clan's
lore�with jaded
             nonchalance. Actual violence has become so commonplace
among
             computer-game players that concerned authorities even have
a term for it that
             borrows from the game: "off-line PK" (player killings).
Paek, who relishes online
             killings as a refreshing change from his decorous real-life
manner, allows that
             physical retribution is merited if players engage in
particularly craven online
             behavior, such as theft or scams involving the game's
coveted virtual weapons.
             Online revenge is O.K. too: "Usually, I kill the ones I
hate," he says. Those are
             fighting words, coming from a shy, skinny 16-year-old who
regularly tops his
             high-school class. But this is the other Paek speaking, the
ruthless (and
             female�go figure) elf who is master of Lineage, a medieval
fantasy game that
             has swept Korean society into a gaming frenzy. "In reality,
I have few ways to
             express myself or show off," Paek says. "But in the game,
if I put in a little effort,
             many people will know who I am."

             In South Korea, a deeply conformist
             society where children must speak to
             elders with a special deferential grammar,
             this bloodthirsty game has caught on with
             a vengeance. In Lineage, gamers playing
             princes, wizards and elves fight one
             another to the death in mini-armies or
             clans, headed by guild masters, to gain
             control of the castles that dot the virtual
             world. The victors can then levy feudal
             taxes upon virtual villages under their
             control and dun gamers a percentage of
             each online weapons sale. All this can be
             fairly lucrative, especially since there's a
             thriving black market that exchanges the
             virtual items for cold, hard cash. But what
             makes the game so addictive is its complex feudal
environment, which hooks
             players after they invest days or weeks building up the
strength of their online
             characters. Based on its success in garnering online
subscribers in Korea alone,
             Lineage is the most popular single interactive online game
in the world right now,
             ahead of Sony's Everquest, Electronic Arts' Ultima Online
or even Microsoft's
             Asheron's Call, according to Samsung Securities.

             Why does Lineage have such a hold in Korea? "This is a
small country,"
             explains Joonmo Kwon, an educational psychologist. "If
everyone you know
             plays Lineage, you have to play it." Besides, says Kwon,
the game's emphasis
             on winning and working in groups speaks to the Korean
spirit. And then there's
             the universal explanation for escapism: "In the real world,
in Korea, you have to
             repress your drives and hidden desires. In the game they
come out."

             In this wired nation, there are PC caf�s on virtually every
street, outfitted with
             the high-speed Internet connections that make interactive
games crackle. Open
             24 hours, and charging just $1 an hour to play, these game
rooms are well
             stocked with cheese-whiz sausages, potato wafers and
instant noodles. Many
             games are played here, but Lineage is the most addictive,
authorities say. Two
             million people, out of a population of 46 million, have
active Lineage accounts.
             And when day turns to evening, close to 100,000 Koreans can
be found glued
             to computer terminals around the country, playing the game
simultaneously.
             School kids in Seoul routinely doze through classes after
playing all night.
             Parents either don't know or can't stop them. Shy young
boys take on alter egos
             as aggressive killers online. A doctor plays ruthlessly
while a neighborhood bully
             has a chance to show compassion. Girl characters,
meanwhile, have sometimes
             been known to offer sexual favors to experienced male
gamers in exchange for
             virtual weapons. But, as one Lineage clan's guild master
notes, who's to say the
             girl characters are really girls?

             The game has also caught on with the loan-sharking
gangsters active in the
             Korean entertainment industry. Some have seized control of
Lineage castles,
             gamers say. They do a brisk side business trading in
virtual weapons and levying
             taxes in the game. In between off-line heists, they boast
among themselves about
             their online exploits. "They guard people for money in the
game," says the
             sweet-faced girlfriend of one gangster, as she leans back
into a red plush couch
             at a Seoul bar. "It's just like reality."

             At times, it seems like the whole nation is caught up in
the confusion.
             Sandwiched between news of the latest political scandals,
Korea's broadsheets
             revel in details of Lineage controversies. One March
article in the Dong-A Ilbo
             reports on an online protest�when "more than 1,000 players
gathered within
             the Lineage world"�after unscrupulous gamers took advantage
of a computer
             glitch to make bootleg copies of the game's prized virtual
weapons. Korea's
             intellectuals and literary hopefuls have also gotten caught
up in the craze. Gamer
             Lee Seung Woo, a draftsman by day whose real-life hope is
to find a girlfriend,
             has written a still unpublished novel about male friendship
set in the game. Then
             there's literary critic Park Sang Woo, whose book on
Korea's game players
             draws on the ideas of French philosopher Michel Foucault.
"For the gamer, the
             game world is much more attractive than reality," he
writes, based partly on his
             own experience. "Reality is only a space in which he makes
a small amount of
             necessary money for continuing the game."

             Even Lineage developer NCsoft has gotten caught up in the
virtual world of its
             own making. Systems administrators, often gamers
themselves, have been fired
             for throwing online events in favor of one gaming clan or
another. The company
             recently issued an online apology to its customers for one
such incident and
             promised it would investigate any allegations of employee
corruption. Kim Taek
             Jin, NCsoft's president, says gamers have attempted to buy
off his staffers with
             gifts of up to $1,000 to manipulate the game. Korean
newspapers report that
             some gangsters recently turned up at the company demanding
personal
             information on online rivals to extract off-line
retribution.

             Not surprisingly, NCsoft's Seoul headquarters is fortified
with double steel
             doors and fingerprint scanners for the server room. "In
Korea," Kim says dryly
             about Lineage's diehard fans, "hate is a kind of love." To
protect the game
             software, Kim has set up security procedures that might be
more familiar to a
             bank. Meanwhile, vigilantes with names like the Honorable
Resolution Clan take
             it upon themselves to monitor their own members as well as
the behavior of
             unsavory rivals. Online killings are often accompanied by
abusive curses and
             threats sent in instant messages. Sometimes, entire
clans�numbering in the
             dozens�storm down to NCsoft headquarters to demand redress
when another
             has wronged them. Others take a more legalistic approach,
meticulously
             documenting grievances by taking "screen saves" of
incriminating moments in
             online battles.

             Others prefer to settle their own scores, such as Paek's
Strong People Blood
             Pledge clan. A number of the 16-year-old's gang sport the
close-cropped
             haircuts and tight suits that gangsters here wear as a kind
of uniform, he says.
             When members meet, they usually like to carry out online
player killings
             together. Paek doesn't seem worried about the clan's
reputed gangster ties. "It's
             O.K. when we get to know each other," he says. "If they are
enemies, it's really
             scary."

             Authorities say three types of crime are common in the
game: hacking into
             others' accounts to steal weapons, stealing users' online
identification and fraud
             connected to the sale of virtual arms. Kim Gi Bum, an
inspector in one of the
             police's new cybercrime units�founded after authorities
were deluged with
             complaints from Lineage gamers�tells of a 14-year-old
runaway who recently
             defrauded gamers out of about $10,000 by promising to sell
them virtual
             weapons but not delivering the goods after he was paid. The
boy, who often
             slept in the PC caf� where he played Lineage, pulled off
128 fraudulent deals
             over a year before he was captured.

             For the non-player, the mixing of reality and fantasy
boggles the mind. But
             serious game players live their lives toggling between the
two worlds. "The game
             doesn't affect reality," says a red-eyed addict after
spending two nights playing
             virtually nonstop. "Reality affects the game."
