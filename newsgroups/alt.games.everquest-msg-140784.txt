Sure they are rare, but there is still an equal chance for
unguilded_nonuber_noAA_60monk to get an earring from 4C, as there is a
chance of me getting one.

I think it was safehouse where a 2 group win was posted.. id have to check
to be sure though

1-2 people i meant.  99% of it is solo stuff, but triggering (i forget his
name... the SK in droga) is more than likely a 2 person kill (healer and
melee.  dunno if a druid or wiz could solo it)

Define non-uber.     To me, non-uber is a guild who is at or below Derakor
the Vindicator level.

Killing the RoS is basically
a) keep adds under control  (every guild has chanters)
b) keep him slowed (every guild has shamans, not all 60 shms are in uber
guilds either)
c) get a rotation going on your MA (get your clerics to count to xxx and
cast cheal)

Sure it may not be easy, but its doable thats for sure.

And yes, he drops the FT IV gloves.

Why is it difficult?  You do NOT need more than a few people for the item
pharming (sirens etc)

If your talking in terms of trade skill difficulty.. well you don't need to
be in an uber guild to do trade skills.

And as for difficulty in raising trade skills..  I went away last weekend
(left saturday, came back home sunday) and in that time my girlf had gone
from 0 brewing to 248 (248 being what i needed for my coldain ring quest)

Some people enjoy trade skills... so please do tell, what makes the 8th
shawl so difficult, or reserved for uber guild members only?

They were dropping twice a day, for a LONG time.  40k on prexus to buy

im talking about mob difficulty, and the need (or lackof) to be in an uber
guild to achieve it.  sure some of these things are a major time sink, but
they are open to anybody, notjust top guilds.

Sure, but theres competition in all guilds, at every level.  Just because 10
other people want the same item you do, doesnt mean you didn't/don't have
the option to get one

> Would be?  You are delusional man.  COULD be.

Yes, could be.  Mainly because several of those items are a major time
sink.. they still COULD get them though, and then they WOULD be within sight
of the mana cap.

I doubt we have anybody over the cap either, but its not because they
couldn't.  Your guild members could hit the cap if they chose so..  its not
a gear combination that any/many people would go for.. but they still COULD
