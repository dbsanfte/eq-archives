I'm not a high-level tradesman (I took an enchanter to just above 100 in 
all skills, bar tinkering), but from everything I've heard, the curve of 
time and money invested per point increased pretty much becomes 
exponential at higher levels. Really annoying, but at least it makes 
high-level craftsmen sufficiently rare.
