Its not available to everyone, thats what.  This makes it useless
to me 95% of the time.  I bought PoP, /raid is one of the PoP
features, and a long awaited one... but I can't use it.  Why?
Because most people in my guild don't have PoP, and its useless
to form a raid of the five or six people we have who do.

OK, you are thinking "thats the point, force people to buy PoP!"
but they can't.  Due to what looks to me like outlandishly bad
shipping policies, most people in my guild can't get PoP for love
nor money, although they will gradually come up to speed... since
they are mainly european players.  Copies of PoP bought here and
shipped as "gifts" are starting to arrive, others, though, are
tied to the european release schedule.  Sure, most of them will
eventually get PoP, but even after this there will be those who
can't afford the $50+ it takes to get the expansion over there,
kids playing the game on their allowance, that sort of thing.

If there's one person on the raid who isn't on the raid channel
it loses a lot of its attractiveness.  I know this from having
had a raid member who couldn't use the chat channels.  Guess
what, we ended up doing raids in /ooc or /guild or having to
parrot everything that was said to him in tells... it was a
nuisance, particularly as the private channels were -such- an
improvement.

Well I just went on a prolonged raid in NTOV yesterday, and
already I was thinking how much it sucked that we couldnt' use
the raid channel.  But its going to be a month or more before we
can really use it with even 95% of our people on it.

As more guildmates gear up, I do want to get all the PoP people
on a raid channel anyway, so we can play around with it.  One
question that comes to mind immediately; if my 12 people do more
damage than any regular group of 6, do we get the Exp?  Or is it
that one GROUP within my "raid" needs to outdamage all the other
groups of the raid?
