I've seen some guildies have bad experiences with problem(s) similar to
this...for example, one was sitting in EC with a crafted helm equipped, and a
level 5 troll comes up and offers to trade an SSB for it. Of course, he
accepts. It seems that an hour or so later, the trollbie decided he didn't want
the crafted helm, and wanted his SSB back. So when he can't find the guy, he
gets pissed...Really pissed. And starts shouting and OOCing like mad about how
this guy cheated him, etc...really hurt his rep, in fact. The trollbie went as
far as to post the guy's name for consideration on the server shit list. While
it didn't stay, even having a name there for a day or so really hurts. I know
that this doesn't have much to do with the situation, but I can see the axe guy
getting mad and doing something similar. So it seemed to me that it would be
better to be nice (perhaps get on the hall of honor? I've seen people get put
on there for doing nice stuff like that before...not sure if my server is the
only one that has this or not) to help your rep rather than possibly injure it.
