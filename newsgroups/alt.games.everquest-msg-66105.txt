Well, that kinda worked.  I can get into EQ now, but my monitor
reverts to its default settings whenever I change resolutions.  It
didn't do that before.  What I mean is, I have the screen stretched
edge to edge, but when I start the game there's a black border around
the viewing area.  I have to readjust the monitor settings (horizontal
and vertical size) each time to get it back to fullscreen.  However,
when I get back to the desktop, whether I adjusted the monitor or not,
it's back the way I set it.  Anyone have any idea how to fix that?

As long as I'm begging for free tech support, at some point in all
this upgrading and whatnot, the rear speakers in my surround sound
setup seem to have stopped working.  I still hear the hiss of a
powered circuit, but no sound comes out whatsoever.  I checked all the
external wires, and they are all connected.  Next chance I get, I'm
going to open up the box to see if I knocked anything loose recently.
These are Altec Lansing speakers and an SBLive! card, and I updated
the drivers from the Sound Blaster web site yesterday.  Any ideas?
