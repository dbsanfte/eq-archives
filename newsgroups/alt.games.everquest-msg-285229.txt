You could pick up some terms if you hang around on
http://everquest.allakhazam.com and in their EQ forum as well as
EQLive forum on Sony at
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq?no_redir=true

I would be a mentor but I let the subscription lapse a few weeks ago.
I participated in beta testing of TSS and got mostly blah plus almost
a third of my guild also left game in the past 6 months and my guild
aren't active much.  So not much of a reason for me to play on EQ at
this time. :(

Taking a few months or so away from EQ lets me avoid those
first-to-level 75 glory hogs, rampant camp stealing and KSing, etc.
It was awful when I started on the progressive server early on and
Maelin is full of high end guilds (Triality comes to mind)
