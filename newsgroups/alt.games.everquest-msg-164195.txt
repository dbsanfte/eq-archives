I've often given thanks that there's no such thing
as collision damage in the game.

Not in the horizontal plane, anyway -- you can take
a bit of damage if you swim straight downward fast

Might be pretty funny if they added it, though.

Hmm, time to fire up the theme song from "George
of the Jungle" on the new in-game MP3 player:
"Watch out for that tree!"
