I have had daily crashes since 2 patches ago and since the patch yesterday I
can go only a few minutes no matter what zone I am in.  I've tried
everything.  New graphics, sound, mouse, motherboard drivers, eqplaynice.
Ran thorough diagnostic programs on memory and hard disk, and semi-thorough
on graphics and sound.  Removed sound card, changed graphics card (from
radeon 9700 to an old 7000).  Acceleration low, models off, msconfig disable
all in startup tab, delete eqclient.ini, delete /maps.  I eventually
repartitioned and reinstalled everything.  Nothing fixes this.  Perhaps the
Gods are telling me NO to eq.
