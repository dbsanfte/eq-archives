Wouldn't be used, as it would be along the same lines as Mightystrike.
Sure, it's fun to do... but afterwards, two hours in which you're unable to

If you used it on one boss mob, it might be a whole complete raid before you
could do any discipline again.


If it was treated as an AA ability, with an independent recharge time, then
sure.
