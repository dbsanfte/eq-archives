Pottery to the skill level that you need for the Thurgadin Gate potion
costs, umm, well under 50pp.  If you have the [trivial to collect]
dropped items the rest can be purchased and combined *inside Thurgadin
Bank* and finished 30 seconds run away.  You can get pottery to 125 or
so in about 3 hours from a skill level of 0.

Unless you are genuinely Giantkin (and not a faction jumper) then you
should either (a) have a Thurgadin Gate Potion with you or (b) be on
the way to make your new Thurgadin Gate Potion having just used your
last one.  If you are Giantkin then you need to bite the bullet and -
gasp - pay a Shaman for an alchemy port potion.

No excuses.
