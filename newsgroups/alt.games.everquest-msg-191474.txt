Inspect the weapons.  You will see that you have about a 4 point
"damage bonus".  This is based solely on your level, not your weapon
skill.  Now consider the math.  Assume two equal ratios:

10 / 20
20 / 40

Both have a damage/delay of 0.5.

But if your damage bonus is 5, the ratios become:

15 / 20 = 0.750
25 / 40 = 0.625

*With* the damage bonus, the faster weapon will do higher DPS.  Since
you only get a damage bonus in the primary, you want the fastest in
primary.

For pure DPS, put the Lammy in primary with the weapons you have now. 
The Lammy doesnt miss a greater percentage of the time, it may just
seem so.  There are other things to consider of course.  For example,
if you want to work on dual wield, you want as many swings from the
offhand as possible, which means Lammy in offhand.  (ONLY to get sual
wield maxed though).  Also because your dual wield skill is limited at
level 40, your offhand will only swing part of the time...making it a
bit of a mistake to spend a lot of money on the offhand if you have
crap in primary.  And finally, the Wurmy, though slow, is a superior
DPS weapon in primary at your level.

Now as for the wurmy...

Get it.  It is primary-only so you dont have a choice as to where it
will go.  But because it has such a great ratio, you will want it
anyway.

Wurmy is 25/40
Lammy is 9/19

Do the math with, say, a 5 point damage bonus:

30/40 = 0.75
14/19 = 0.74

As you can see, your Lammy won't out-damage Wurmy until you get a
6-point damage bonus.  Therefor, Lammy really isnt a great weapon
until the higher levels...which is why it isn't priced very high
anymore, since there are far better weapons that level 50+ people can
get.  Wurmy however, still sells well for alt twinks.

My advice:
-Sell the Venemous and the Yak.  (Unless the yak has some nice
ratio--Im not familiar with it).  Buy a wurmy.  Put Lammy in offhand. 
Then save up or sell the Lammy and buy a better offhand.  You can find
a weapon with a higher-than-50 percent damage ratio to put in offhand
for cheaper than the lammy most of the time.  Jagged Blade of Mourning
is perfect for you.  It is 13/25 (0.52 ratio) weapon.  Since your
offhand has no damage bonus, JBOM is a better secondary than Lammy. 
Also think about blunt weapons.  Look in to a Club of the Ice Ocean
(14/27 with 149 dd proc--but not sure if it procs are 40), Captain
Guard's Mallet (11/20), and a few others you may find.  For secondary,
get the highest possible ratio, regardless of delay.
