Ha! Generous folk...

Thank God for Find. I have poked around in Kelethin a little, always 
following that wonderful trail that shows me where to go. I looked at a 
map of Kelethin and thought thank God I don't need to learn my way 
around there.

Funny how guys would flirt with a Wood Elf. I guess they are cute in an 
elvish sort of way. Actually, I could love anyone other than a Troll. I 
was married to a Troll for almost 20 years and it was hell, sort of a 
Troll/Ogre mix actually. Very frightening and very mean.
