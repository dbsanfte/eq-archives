I think are forgetting that time and time again, Sony has stated that
their games are made to where you have to have other people help you.
Neither EQ1 or EQ2 are really solo games. The way that I see it. Any
game that is online and multiplayer is ment to be played with other
people (even if you are given the chance to play solo).

I do agree with you though about the part about lock mobs and the quest
credit if you dont complete the encounter. I was in beta for 3 months,
and that is one thing that bugged the hell out of me. I also hated how
(me being a healer) could not help keep people alive who were not in my
group. Seems pretty unrealistic to me. But then again, perhaps they
werent shooting for realism.
