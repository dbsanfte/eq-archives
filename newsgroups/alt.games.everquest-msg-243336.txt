Most serious money farmers are 65, and I was speaking *as* a 65.

If I was farming items to sell for rl cash, I would likely have more than
one lvl 65 (a guy in my guild has 5 accounts, each has at least one lvl 65
char on it), I dont know if he is farming for cash or farming to arm more
alts. but he camps BoT and waits for named to spawn. depending on where
exactly in bot he is, and luck, all it takes is one ornate greaves mold and
he just made enough plat that you could spend over 36 hours straight farming
your 4k/hour crap in unrest and notmake as much as he just did.
