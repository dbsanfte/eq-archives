Hail, friends. I am Winterfury Thunderwolf, Shaman of the 27th season, and
my wife Summerbreeze is Warrior of the 28th season. We both hail from Halas
and follow the Six Hammers of The Tribunal. I am soon to embark upon my
profession as an Alchemist, the art of my people.

We are relatively new to this world and although we are able to explore all
regions of Norrath and its moon, we are still learning our way around this
huge universe. We seek new places to hunt and adventure and would appreciate
any suggestions appropriate for this duo.

We spent much of our youth in the Paludal Caverns and Warslik Woods. The
Forest Giants of WW are rumored to drop great treasures, but they are rare
indeed and we did not fare well on that particular goal. The great
Reishicyben of Paludal was exceptional fun, we discovered it while exploring
and spent many hours there fighting off the protectors of this grand
mushroom. The treasures we uncovered! We are a couple of modest means, but
these treasures yielded hundreds of platinums in the Bazaar and I believe my
Alchemy has indeed been funded for some short time. More importantly, the
discovery of this source of adventure and funds was one of the great
experiences we have enjoyed.

We are wondering if it would be wise for us to start pursuing our armor
quests. I have heard mixed reports on both Totemic and Crafted, but we are
inclined to pursue both because it is in our traditional Barbarian blood,
but we are open to advice and suggestions. Would it be wise for us to pursue
these adventures at our age? Are there better? And what about our Epic
Quests? Is it too early (or too late) to begin these?

We have most recently been helping the residents of Highhold Keep rid their
basement of unseemly pickclaw goblins, and that quest has been rewarding in
its training, but we have done battle there for many seasons and tire of it.
We seek other, more exotic adventure in newly discovered portions of the
world with which we are not at all familiar. Any suggestions for adventure
that will yield training, treasures and the glory of honorable battle?

Many thanks, I hope to see you on the battlefield!
