You may be right about that.  It's also possible that things went more
like:
1) Spend a couple months watching to see how it games out (they
can't really know what the players are gonna do with something
until they go ahead and let them play with it),
2) Some of the devs recognize the problem, discussions about whether
it's a real issue ensue, followed by brainstorming and discussions
of possible changes to eliminate/mitigate the problem(s) with the
existing system,
3) After months of fruitless attempts to come up with a way to "fix"
the flagging system, they decide to partially abandon it, granting
open access to some content and keeping restrictions on the rest.

Or, it could have been more-or-less planned this way from the start:
"First we squeeze 'em hard, see, that'll let the ubers and wannabe
ubers feel good about their semi-exclusive access.  Then, once it's
clear that the strong guilds have moved past the Tier 2 content, but
before very many other players have quit out of frustration, we'll
the middle stuff up to everybody."
(Please feel free to elaborate on that skeletal conspiracy theory
as you see fit.)

See?  It doesn't require laziness.  Ordinary failures to predict how
a complex system will behave "in the real world" combined with fairly
ordinary bureaucratic loginess, or a "conspriacy to reward the ubers",
or some other silliness, or some combination (possibly including your
preferred "laziness" scenario) could easily account for what we've
seen.  We just don't have enough information.  We need agents on the
inside, we're looking at a severe "humint" failure here!  It's time
we started pointing fingers and passing bucks!  It's all a plot I'm
telling you!  We got Bob!  And they ain't!  So we can hate 'em!  Hate
'em!  HATE 'EM!!!!

erm, that's all,
