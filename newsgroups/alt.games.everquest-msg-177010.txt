Firiona Vie is a decent server (not that it's 100% perfect anyway),
but one possible turn-off could be the TLC rule it has implemented. If
you're not familiar with it, it's a rule where if the mob you target
and kill is green conned (or a member of your group has it green
conned), the mob will not drop any magical or lore item. It will
however drop regular items and coins. This could become frustrating
with many quests but it eliminates farming to some degree. The way
Verant balances this is that many items that were No Drop are no
longer No Drop. However, since it's a dedicated RP server, you'll find
a larger percentage of Roleplayers in this server than others. It has
its share of d00dz and 133t gamers (all servers will have them no
matter what), but it's a generally friendly server.

I'm planning to start a new character on a new server as well with
several other close friends (guild politics driving us nuts). You'll
have to log on during the prime hours and then just check which server
has the lowest population. What was the most recent server addition?
