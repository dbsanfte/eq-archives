True. I guess I don't consider that 'doing' the epic. Otherwise I
could 'do' the shaman epic at 20th lvl solo except for the last fight.
Run the first step of the quest to get up to max ally and have someone
else turn in the tear to spawn Rak.  

Doesn't seem worth the trouble though, It takes maybe 30 minutes to
get to and kill Kirn even if you don't do the DA dive down the hole.

Heh, too many memories of sitting at that damn portal to Fear after a
wipe to even consider going into that zone solo.
