I don't have a problem using a switch, in fact I prefer it to multiple
monitors.  I'd rather have one 21" monitor than two 17" monitors set
at annoying, neck breaking angles.  As for having more than one
keyboard and mouse on my desk, that would be an absolute nightmare!  I
occasionally want to see both monitors at once, but it's not often
enough to be a problem and there are other ways around that if I'm
desperate (terminal services in the case of the server, or a remote
desktop tool for any of the other PCs).  So for me, it works.  YMMV.
