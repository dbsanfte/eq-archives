You better believe it. Tuesday's episode had one of its characters being
labelled as a "lunatic" with "something wrong with them". I changed channels
rapidly at this point, but in retrospect perhaps I should have carried on
watching and taped the program.
 
A few days ago I bought a video recorder (about time too) for evidence
gathering purposes. But strangely the TV news (both BBC and ITN) haven't
uttered a sound over the last few days. Almost as if they know they're being
taped...

And?

There are many characters in TV programmes who _are_ lunatics with
'something wrong with them'. Why do you think this alludes to you?

In the eponymous book, Cervantes' Don Quixote is described as 'crazy' 
'mad' and 'lunatic'. Do you think this is a reference to yourself, 
albeit written by a time-travelling 17th century Spaniard?

If you accept that the character of Don Quixote can be described thus
without it being a reference to you, what problem do you have with
Peak Practice? Or do you enjoy tilting at your own little windmills?

A friend's lodger has turned out to be paranoid schizophrenic. Her
obsessions are strikingly similar to yours, she is convinced that she
is being bugged, and that students at her college are making fun of
her for being foreign. She has been looking for the services of a
private detective. Maybe Oxford has this unfortunate effect on foreigners?

I must say that I'm surviving rather well, or that's what the man
under the stairs told me yesterday.

So Mike, you are a woman, married to a doctor,have two children, speak
spanish, and living in the Peak District. Is that a fair description of
you?
