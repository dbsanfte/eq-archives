Hiyas

Does anyone know wether or not account sharing is "legal"? Two friends and I
are all thinking of sharing accounts as we all have dual PCs at home and
sometimes having access to each others account (for ports and stuff) would
be very handy. However we do not want to do this if it is a breach of the
ToS / EULA. So does anyone know 100% for sure if account sharing is allowed?
What about "dual PCing" to PL a char or port yourself etc?

Thanks in adavance for any answers.
