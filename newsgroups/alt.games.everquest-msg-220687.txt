How do you know it is rapidly declining in popularity?

I seem to recall you declaring DAoC to be dying about two months after
release, and I just went back there while on my EQ break, and found plenty
of crowded servers, so I'm not exactly impressed with your ability to
discern the popularity of things. :-)

That's great for appropriate areas.  I doubt anyone would suggest that a
place like West Karana be instanced, or even a dungeon like Blackburrow.  A
dungeon full of people can be fun, especially if it has a high spawn rate.
It can feel like a major battle is going on, and your party is part of it.

However, there are things where there shouldn't be other people.  The
original planes, for instance (!), would have been a lot better instanced.
On servers that had a calendar that the planes-capable guild respected, so
that they were effectively instanced, a guild could reserve a day, get
everyone together, and go find a fully popped plane, and spend all day
clearing it and taking down the named mobs.
