I've been having a good time in split paw at 31, I'd suggest trying
there.

Haven't touched overthere recently.  But there's several things you
could do there to make yourself usefull to a group.  I used to solo or
group there occasionally with my enchanter at about that level, but that
was before the advent of kei.  Bring up an animation, root the mob you
are fighting and get hit once.  Get a nice kitty, and perma charm it. 
Your nukes are not second rate, they are SLOW.  Their mana/damage ratio
is on par with other pure casters such as wizards, at least up till 49 -
use them.  You have a slow use it if there isn't a shaman in the group,
will make a big difference in damage tanks are taking, allowing your
healers to be full all the time and spend some of thier mana on damage
instead of healing (if they are smart, not too many smart though).  

If you can't get a group charm solo.  I always got more xp charm soloing
with my enchanter than grouping.  Make good friends with a cleric if you
can though, frequent deaths will bring that xp total at the end of the
day down quick.

Split paw is good. You might try Guk, I don't like it though. Sol B if
you get a Kei might be doable, but more like lv 35-40, awsome xp there. 
Iceclad.  Crystal Caverns. Dawnshroud.  I've heard Hollowshade is good
too, but haven't tried it.

Justi Saurane lv 54 Enchanter, Brell.  Still soloing yellows, and still
dying every day.
