One side is SolB on steroids.

The other side is SolA on steroids *and* PCP.

Drops are nice, though some are still buggy.  We got a 30/30 2hb off a 
named, was also none/none.  Fortunately the monk won the role as the next 
day it had been patched to mnk and bst only.  It has a 70ish dd fire proc 
on it, but gives a "this item is out of charges" message every time it 
tries to proc.  At least we know it procs like a mofo ;)  That's the only 
piece I've seen that hasn't hit Alla's yet.  Loot for the most part seems 
comparable to ChardokB, and the zone seems a lot easier to get to.

I still need to hit up ChardokB for some of those nice earrings though :P

I spent way too many hours in SolC on that first day, I really have no 
desire to go back now.  Unless it's to get twink gear, but most the pieces 
are still upgrades for all the casters in the group.
