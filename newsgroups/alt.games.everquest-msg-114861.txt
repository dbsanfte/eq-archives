I tend not to ignore dumbasses, just spammers, if I ignore a dumbass (such
as this guy), then I miss their inevitable train warnings and dying
irritates me.  Also, I didn't really argue with him, he mostly just ranted
non-sensically at me, with my occasional retort to keep him going to confirm
his dumbass factor.

Examples:

At shady in EC, 2 people are spamming /random , /ignore for both of them.

In KC, dipshit cleric shouts train every 2 minutes (trying to solo? who
knows, he had at least 50 corpses in the KC/DL area), yeah, he's a spammy
moron, but it's really useful to know when to look up and watch for a train.
