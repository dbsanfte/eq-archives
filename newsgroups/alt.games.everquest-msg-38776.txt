Well, if the two you made were 59 and 60, I'd say the mystery is solved. ;-)

And I'm quite confident that I have exactly three levels of happy, carefree
leveling left, and then I have it on good authority that it's going to
seriously start sucking and I may as well forget xp grinding, go try to have
a good time, and hope that I hear a surprising "ding" every month or two.
What am I saying, "happy and carefree"??!!?? Level 45 seriously BLEW GOATS!

(Does *anybody* go anywhere and try to xp grind after they hit 51? Or do you
just say fuck it, and go help out your guildmates?)
