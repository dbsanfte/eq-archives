}Well some spells are double checked against multiple resistances, any
}failure negates entire spell. Good example is Breath of Ro, (hope my
}memory serves) which is checked on both magic and fire. There are
}others to be sure. Most spells only check one resist, root for example
}uses magic. Dont know exact formulas sorry. Gets complex dont it :)

Hmm.  lucy.fnord.net under Breath of Ro, Resist, just says 'Fire'.  How 
can I find out concretely about these other secondary checks?
