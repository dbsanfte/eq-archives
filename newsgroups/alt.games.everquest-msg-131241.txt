Ah, I think I heard that too possibly about the wheel? For scrolling
chat windows maybe? I don't have a wheel, I find them irritating on
the middle mouse button and just have ye old logitech 3 button mouse.
I'm hoping if they have the wheel like that they recognize the middle
button and make it so when you hit a key and the middle button it
strolls one way maybe and otherwise the other by default.
