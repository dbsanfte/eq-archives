Well, I was hunting in hte Rathe Mountains, killing Hill Giants for
exp and cash. I was starting to get encumbered by platinum (There's a
problem you don't have often), when Hasten ran by.

I hailed him to make him stop and asked if anyone needed Hasten. No
reply, so I was going to let him run off. On a whim I handed him 325pp
to reduce my encumberance, and got Jboots!

Some poor soul must have handed in the ring and went linkdead, or
something. I almost, but not quite, feel bad about it. How many
untwinked 35 Gnecros have Jboots? ;-)
