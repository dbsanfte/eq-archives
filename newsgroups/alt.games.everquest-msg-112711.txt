I can't help you with the spell-buying issue, but I can suggest a tactic
for skill training.

When I go up levels, I grab a fishing pole, a couple buckets of bait, run
down to the docks, and train up. Mem your lowest-mana spell for each skill
(for you that would be True North, Minor Shielding, and Weaken). Target
yourself (or pet), then Sense Heading, Fish, True North, Sense, Minor
Shielding, Sense, Weaken, Fish, Sense, True North, Sense, Minor Shielding,
Sense, Fish, . . .

It's especially helpful (but not necessary) if you can fish while
facing north. :)

When you run out of mana, *sit* and Sense, Sense, Sense, Fish, Sense,
Sense, Fish, Sense, .... Med will increase on its own while you're sitting.

When all your mana comes back, *stand* and continue where you left off.

When you max out on Abjuration (for example), just drop it off the spell
casting rotation. When you max out on Sense Heading, drop that too.

Always keep up the fishing though. If you run out of bait, or fill up
inventory, sell all your junk off and buy more bait. Be sure to retarget
yourself (or pet) when you get back to docks. Bait merchants don't like
having Weaken cast on them. (Learned *that* lesson the hard way :/)

When you're done, you'll have bunches of skills maxed out, stacks of edible
fish, and bags off sellable junk (slippers, daggers, scales). You will
find that you will actually *make* money while training up your skills.
It even gets you rusty daggers to sharpen if you're into that sort of
thing. You can wear the slippers as free foot armor. And fish scales are
components for Enduring Breath spells later on.

I don't recommend practicing Conjuration in this way until you can afford
several *stacks* of Tiny Daggers to waste maxing up your skill for that
first time. Evocation is best practiced by casting on your pet, but it
takes *forever* to increase because the mana cost is so high for you.

This technique works reasonably well for other caster and hybrid classes,
and you can twist in Hide, Forage, Track, and Beg attempts too. Bind Wounds
even, if you work it right. It's not as useful for warriors (who have few
non-combat skills) or bards (who must be holding instruments rather than
fishing poles to train up most music skills).

Hope that helps!
