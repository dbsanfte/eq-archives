Not positive here, but I don't think that's the case.  When I was on the phone
with Verant about my "key in use" they even asked me, "Your name doesn't happen
to be .... Jim Smith (or whatever)."  They then informed me that it was an
active account paid in full, so they would have to give me a different one.
First, I thought it was sort of a breach to tell me the guy's name, and second
it certainly didnt' sound like they were going after him.  More like all they
cared was that the account was in use, they were getting their 10 bucks a month,
and were now going to get yet another person to sigh up and pay.
  ::: shrug::: Doesn't matter much to me either way. They quickly corrected the
situation, and now, to the best of my knowledge, both "Jim" and I are both
happily playing.
