My guild has done something like that, sorta kinda  :)

A bunch of us made alts, got the guild tags, and then went PvP.  We
have a RP battle story going on in-guild with plenty of slaughter on
both sides.  However, it's all within the one guild, and it's only one
day of the week.  It is, however, a lot of fun  :)
