Look, it could be Morley's fucking Grandma giving consent at his PC.

StanMann is a fucking moron who hijacked a pretty cool thread just to have a
dick flopping contest.  He even had the balls to crosspost it over to
alt.2600 when he wasn't achieving the desired result.

We can talk about 'consent' and all that bullshit and in a court of law none
of it adds up to a cup of jack squat.  Ol' StanMann OTOH, starts sniffing
and probing people's ports regardless of what the fuck is posted here or
anywhere, will eventually get him in deep shit with his ISP.

StanMann and the rest of you idiots practicing Internet Law should just go
the fuck back to talking about something you at least know a tiny bit
about - like EQ or masturbation.
