I think the absolute one thing that pisses me off is the definition of a warrior
being a damage taker and not a damage dealer.

Yes ok the MA has to take lots of dmg, and the SA has to be ready to as well. But
out of the 30 other people on a raid say there are 4-5 other warriors, they should
be massive damage dealers !!! I mean its a WARRIOR, and expert in battle, a bad
ass, oh, wait, no, every other melee out damages a warrior. I think it is
ridiculous, we should have our tank/aggro abilities and be able to dish out some
serious damage when not the main damage taker.


I am not asking for anything else, I can deal with all the rest just please let me
do as much damage with some weapons as the damn bare handed monk next to me,
pleeease!.
