There you go making assumptions.  I wasn't level 55 at the time, so, brown
bear.  The monk was not a lizard, he was a human.  Other than that though,
it was a blast.  We also had a level 3 or so SK that was mooching off the
junk that we did not loot.  She said that by the end of a couple of evenings
of that she had made around 1kpp.  Oh, yes, she was a local resident.
