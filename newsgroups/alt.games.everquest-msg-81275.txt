IMO, EQ does not need a lot of advertising.  I believe word-of-mouth has
been it's best tool.  All of my friends, family and co-workers know about
the game now because of my addiction <g>.  Many of them have never been a
"gamer" before and have become interested now.  Also, if you are a "gamer",
how could you *not* know about EQ?

I'm actually thinking about get "SOW PLZ" as my vanity plate <g>.
