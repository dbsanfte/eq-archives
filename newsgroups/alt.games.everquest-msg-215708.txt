   I happen to be a big fan of the mana preservation thing also.  One
way to look at doing this cheaply is to check the bazaar for the items
needed to make a Fine Antique ring in the PoK.  HQ cougarskin, Tine
Rockhopper Eye, Undead Froglok tongue, and Cockatrice beak.  I would
imagine that they vary from server to server, but on FV I bought them
all for cheap... less than 50 plat, and probably less than 25.
