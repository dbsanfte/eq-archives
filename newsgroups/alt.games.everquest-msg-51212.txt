    No, the high end stuff does sell. But nobody is willing to sink a ton of
*time* and cash into skilling to the point where one sees returns because
that time could be spent making better cash and XP by adventuring. And since
the game is based around grouping and adventuring, you'll never see trade
skills become an "alternate path of advancement".

    The items don't sell because the people who need them either don't know
they exist, *make their own*, cannot find a tradeskiller who is willing to
spend his time hoping new characters are created wherever he's pitched his
tent, or have access to better. Only one of those, the last point, is
related to your "never decays" idea. And the others seem to be far more
prevalent than the last point.

    I guarantee Goodyear would never sell me any tires if I could learn to

    ...because the newbie population is low because, well, it's a mature
server. When I pass through newbie zones, I rarely see more than a handful
of new players there. A tradeskiller would be daft to go there and sell
patchwork, because there's not enough demand there for him to make the same
cash as he could killing mobs elsewhere.

>have enough money to get started with trade skills.

    That isn't true. If anything, EQ tradeskills are set up such that at the
level one would USE the product made, one has the cash to skill up and
create the item. Maybe not to the trivial, I-can-churn-out-hundreds level,
but to the level where items can be produced with reasonable frequency.

    Be clever in your hunting. When I recently moved some 150-odd items that
a packrat player had accumulated in his bank account, the easiest items to
sell were the 50 to 100 plat items like INT earrings and rings, WIS rings,
low-end weapons - the stuff teen-level characters would be after, and would
want to buy. People making twinks come from all ends of the cash spectrum,
and most won't have a ready-made stash of items to drop on the latest
experimental character.

    The U.S. has such a gap, yet I can't imagine anyone saying it has a poor
economy.

    It can be frustrating to watch others with awesome gear cruise by while
you suffer in your ringmail and bronze. But the coin will come in from mob
drops if nothing else - and frankly you can buy a LOT more for that coin
from other players now than you could a year ago.

    No Drop items appear at the top end of the player spectrum, where
players don't need to purchase much equipment anyways. Most high level
players spend cash on twink gear, consumables, and services. Again, that's
how it should be - if high level players have to purchase personal gear from
someone lower level, then they must be as capable as the lower level of
obtaining the item and you get "bottom feeding". Because people WILL spend
time camping stuff if it's for personal use.

    Correct, to other players who currently pay (on my server) from a few
hundred pp to a few K pp for the rare ones. And everyone on the server would
want the quest items in question, until they had them.

    Why would you assume that? Scarcity comes from how many are on the
server, which is a function of drop rate, camp rate, and server age. And you
still haven't shown the widget to be useful.

    But that's not a discrepancy. Look at DAoC trade skill items - there's a
supply of them limited only by cash on the server, and people making them.
New players will NOT be able to make money off tradeskills, as by the time
they come along tradeskill item prices on low-end gear will be priced within
a fraction of cost. Look at Jewelcrafting on a mature server - the senior
jewelcrafters will take commissions on low-end pieces at or near cost,
because they almost never fail and the "hassle factor" is low. Even with
decay and higher demand on these low-end items, tradeskillers will STILL try
and price new tradesmen out of the market to preserve margins on high-end
items.

    A note at this point: the ONLY items I see going for "trade only" on my
server (Quellious) are one-of-a-kind,
the-owner-EBayed-and-it-got-on-the-market type of gear like the monk bracer
off Tormax. Everything else the "big three" sell has a cash price attached.
(The big three being Tsuken and Tigerstyle - professional merchants - and
Ciff, the sales mule for Vis Maior, the top guild of Quellious.) So talking
about the "trade only" items as if there's a lot of them out there is a
little off. In my experiences, one only sees "trade only" when the supply of
items is strongly limited.

    Heh, hardly. I see items in EC going for as much as 100 K to 200 K pp,
and multiple items sell in the tens of K pp range. Most players have never
seen that much cash, or have had it at ONE point then spent it all. So
pricing matters. Even if all you're doing is equipping a new twink, there's
20 slots to fill, not counting situational/utility gear and packs. If you
don't budget and don't have a clear idea of what you want it's quite easy to
spend more than you really should, and end up back in the poorhouse.

    No. No, no, no. Players level past the point at which those items have
value. Patchwork could rot as fast as you like and a level 20 player
wouldn't want it. On a mature server, low-level characters are the minority.
So low-end gear has no value because there's no demand. If the argument is
then "well, then player-made items should ALWAYS be competitive with mob
drops", then players would gravitate to wherever the cash/risk ratio was
highest and all make their own items rather than pay an inflated price to a
tradeskiller. Which doesn't sound like a fun game. I'd rather have a
climactic battle with the Orc King to seize his crown than kill his minions
over and over to craft the Crown of James.

>They do not continue to sell

    Of course not. People need level-appropriate gear, and outlevel the
early tradeskill products.

    Everyone can go camp what they want, if they're so inclined. Everyone
knows what the items that have preserved value, or still have relatively
high value, are - the Frog Crowns, Fungi Tunics and GEBs of the EQ world.
You can't tradeskill your way to the top, but you sure can camp your way
there, or (for the stock traders in the crowd) you can EC your way there.
Last time I counted, Tigerstyle or Tsuken (the one that's the original
character) had about 500 K worth of gear at level 30-odd. All from sitting
in the EC tunnel and buying low, selling high. It isn't for me, but it can
be done - and I'm sure he started with a newbie note and some biscuits and
milk like the rest of us.

>You want money and items to change hands among all the population.

    It does. At lower levels, sell pelts, silks, and bone chips to higher
level characters. As you level, you can sell the odd drop, and services -
SoW, ports, buffs. It works, really.

    Heh. You know, most tradeskills aren't like Tailoring. Fletching,
Brewing, and Pottery can all be raised to near-Grandmaster status with very
little cash outlay. Jewelcrafting has been expensive to raise since Beta.
Baking is inexpensive to get to the practical maximum, but cannot be raised
near Grandmaster because of the scarcity of the only method of getting
skill-ups past around 156 or so (dragon meat). And the biggest cost to
Smithing wasn't the cash, but rather the time spent getting leather padding
for the push to Grandmaster skill. Tailoring is the ONLY tradeskill that
received a retroactive "cost increase". This is because before Velious, it
was a tremendously incomplete tradeskill - the maximum score before
everything was trivial was in the 118 (Tailored Quiver) range, and I don't
think the trades designer realized there WAS no bridge from that point to
the top-end gear. It would be like Jewelcrafting without any Gold, just
Silver, Electrum, Platinum.
