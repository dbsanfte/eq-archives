Right now, the tentative schedule for our guild to hit that area is the 
next day, Sunday the 6th.  I can't attend that day, so I don't know if they 
will change it or not.  I have my Kindle piece already thanks to a kind 
guild that happened to be pulling to that room while I was exploring with 
my Rogue.  I logged in Zym, they CoTH'd him, and toasted Kindle.  Pie.
