Oh, so it's okay to outright lie when you're a presidental candidate
these days?  I'm glad you told me.  Personally, I expect more from our
presidential candidates.

Speaking of lies, it looks like George W. Bush and his republican
administration was caught in a real whopper this time:

http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/international/middleeast/03tube.html?ex=1254456000&en=2e1cdcc5b66e0332&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland

What's sad is he and his staff knowingly and willingly lied on
multiple occassions over the course of months to get their way.

He promised no such thing.  The only thing presidential candidates can
do is promise to try, and Clinton *did* try to implement at least a
minimum guaranteed health care system in the United States, a
respectable safety net for people down on their luck.

We'll have to agree to disagree on the quality of the work, then.

Have you run out of real points and need to split hairs?

No, it's not a "democrat" phrase, it's MY phrase.  Trying to paint all
democrats with such a broad brush is intellectually dishonest.  Also,
it's clearly bullshit you don't care for republicans.  Your posts
consistently approve of every republican policy and dissaprove of
every democrat policy.  If you truly were closer to the middle, you
wouldn't be so one-sided.

Of course, nobody's fooled by this kind of republican astroturfing on
Usenet anymore, so you may as well stop.  There's an endless supply of
posts that say, "I'm neither a republican or democrat, but..." and go
on to praise everything republican and condemn everything democrat.

Sorry, but we're onto you.  Nobody's fooled by the astroturfing
anymore.

And if you'd like to prove you're not a typical republican
astroturfer, name 3 issues you disagree with Bush administration on,
and 3 issues you agree with the Kerry campaign on.  I await your
response.

Funny, I found the graphs to support my assertion that the
republicans have transformed themselves into the fiscally
irresponsible party, starting with Ronald Reagan.

I have no idea what point you're trying to make, though I'm glad you
seem to agree that the republican party has become the fiscally
irresponsible party.

It takes a lot of conviction for the son of an ex-president to condemn
his father's domestic policies, and it shouldn't be overlooked.

Every dollar counts, because it's you and me who get to pay the
interest on the national debt, and due to recent tax law changes, even
more of the burden of that debt has been shifted to us.  Remember, the
republican party is "by the wealthy, of the wealthy, for the wealthy".

Uh-huh.

What a ridiculous hypothetical situation to contemplate.  Asking
Wal-Mart to behave ethically in terms of its employment policies,
compensation policies, and environmental policies is hardly asking
Wal-Mart to "cease to exist".

Ah, yes.  The old "if you're not pro-business at the expense of
everything and everyone else, you're a communist!" approach.  Sorry,
but we're all aware of that game, too.

Arrogance isn't an attractive quality.

I wasn't talking strictly militarily.

Economically, and more than just a flash in the pan, at that.

It's too bad you don't see it.  You'll praise George W. Bush all the
while he picks your pocket and gives the money to his billionaire
friends.

It's fundamentally unfair because workers produce value and wealth,
and a disproportionate piece of the pie flows to the wealthy.  George
W. Bush merely made it even *less* fair by shifting more of the burden
of debt on the middle and lower class, while reducing the burden on
the upper class.

That you can't see the truth is utterly amazing.  Feel free to
continue to worship your power elite.  I'm more interested in making
sure us regular Joes get our fair share.  After all, we're the suckers
producing the value and wealth.
