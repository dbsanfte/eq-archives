I was doing my normal thing last night, hanging out at Orc Hill,
trying to make some money slashing at Orcs with my steel scimitar,
when out of nowhere comes a guy and offers me a crystallized shadow
scimitar. I told him I would love to have the weapon, but had nothing
of any value to trade.  He told me it was free, gave me the weapon,
bowed and ran off !   WOW!   Even though my only objective at the
moment is cash, I felt it just wouldn't be right if I didn't pass on
the gesture...so I ran over to the old ruines where newbies start out
swinging clubs at bats, and gave my steel scimitar to a lvl 2 druid.
A few times later in the game, I got an occasional tell, letting me
know how much he was enjoying his new scimitar !    I don't know if
others share my sentiment or not, but it was one of my more enjoyable
nights playing......this is cool stuff.
