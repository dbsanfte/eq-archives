In the last week, Bristlebane's Hamster has had a cardiac twice dropping the
server until they get the defibrillator out.
Each time they have rolled back only by 30mins but they have done it. Is
this common procedure. I don't suppose BB goes down anymore than any other
server but on previous occasions when it has I have not noticed a change.

The first time I noticed it I lost some loot and respawned with half the
buffs and half the hit points I expected (that was a bit scary as I spotted
it a little late but no harm was done, the loot was nothing I was going to
scream about) then last night the same thing, I spawned in the same spot I
had logged in as, none of the plat, velium, gems (lost a ruby) or exp that I
had made in the previous 50 minutes (BB crashed a little before the planned
emergency patch) again, no real harm, annoying I had to buff up and med up
again but that is all.
I am sure in a raid situation I'd be over the moon...especially if I had
died in the last 30mins or so but I don't remember hearing about this
happening as people just complain about deaths due to Server crashes.
