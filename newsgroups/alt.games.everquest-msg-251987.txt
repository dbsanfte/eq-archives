I always thought giving a pet weapons will make them put out more damage.  I'm 
using the highest shaman pet which is True Spirit.  I buff the pet up with 
Focus and Haste and during battle he hits for 60 damage max.  Then I give him 
2 weapons and he still only hits for 60 max.  I do notice he may be hitting 
more often after I give him weapons.  Is this how it's supposed to work?  I 
was expecting his max hit to go up.
