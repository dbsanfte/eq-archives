Even bigger, there's an AA skill for necromancers that allows them to
turn various creature "parts" (meats. I don't know if pelts, skins,
etc qualify...) into bone chips, too. Myself, I just wish this had
been a lower-level spell instead. It's silly to force necromancers to
either scum newbie zones or give in to greedy newbies for their pet
reagents instead of being able to buy them at a merchant like every
other pet class that needs 'em can do.
