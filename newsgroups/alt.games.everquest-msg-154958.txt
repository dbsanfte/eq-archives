Rain?  Ick.  (not that you don't also have a rain)  Try a real
AE spell, rains are almost entirely useless... even if you
can get several mobs to promise to stand still and stay
in range, you end up getting a resist on first or second
wave and lose the last wave too.

Besides their AE DD line, look at their PB AE line, same
as cleric line.

Druids get several stackable dots by this point, and in one
more level get a clicky dot... never overlook the effectiveness
of clicky stuff.

Its a rare druid that uses this spell for anything, and interesting
zones with charmable animals in them are not all that easy to
find anyway.

If you are going to use TOTU as your DOT below, you
should at least include the cleric undead only DD as
an alternative here.  Much better spell, more efficient
and low turnaround time on recast.  Not that retribution
is a total slouch.

>

This isnt' AE, its PB AE... special case.  Suicide or
useless in most situations, this is also the most powerful
line out there for a purpose built group, since it hits
an unlimited number of mobs in its radius.  Cleric AE
is limited to a couple AE stuns.

>
> DoT: Turning Of The Unnatural Undead Only (Max: 400) - [Mana 180]

Stacks with Sermon of the Righteous... and both are less
damage per mana than undead DD line.  Only useful
if you are partnered with a DOT caster and want to
damage mobs without breaking root.  Now that DOTs
don't care if mob is moving, this is even less useful than
before, just let the DOT caster load the mob up, then
nuke, run, nuke, run.

They also get a PB AE line...

Again, PB is not the same stuff as regular AE...

I think mages get a real DD AE line, but I know for
sure they get PB AE line, better than cleric/druid/chanter.

OK, forget the rain.  Look at your real AE spell.  And while there,
look at your PB AE line.

Not till 58... and then it will be ever so uber!

Forget rain.  Ick.  Look at the cycle time on your nukes.  Look at resists,
you have more flavors and all your stuff gets resisted less.  Look at your
specialization... know many enchanters who specialized in Evocation?

Look too at your PB AE.  If you can get a PB group together at your
level ( not sure you can, chanters may not be able to handle it) you are
in wizard heaven, damaging 30, 40, 50 mobs at a time with a single
cast.  Yes, other classes can do it too, but I suspect at your level
that you will already be the best at it.. I know you are at higher levels.

Snare.  Mages don't get it, you do.  Snare mobs, move away, nuke,
move away, nuke... mob dies without ever touching you.  Now
snare 4 mobs at once, and get them in close together so you can
hit them all with an AE nuke... now 4 mobs die with you spending the
mana you should have to kill 2.  THIS and no other reason is why
wizards are known as kings of solo.

I agree as a general rule, wizards are less useful than they should be.
However,
if I didn't have a porter already, I would invite one in a hurry.  Ports and
evac
open up the world to a group, and let you get out alive in a hurry if you need
to, or just get out to somewhere convenient when ready.

Wizards also have Snare, which is a critical, critical ability.  There are quite

a few classes who have it, but if you don't have one, you invite a wizard
even if its just for that.
