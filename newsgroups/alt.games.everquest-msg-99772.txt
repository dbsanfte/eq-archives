You beat me to it, I was about to suggest the same thing.

The wording of his statement supports that interpretation:

# We are not yet able to discuss what level increases will occur
# in The Planes of Power,

Hmm..  "Level increases.... IN the Planes of Power..."  Even though
the Kunark expansion allowed players to progress beyond 50,
it would have been odd to word a description of that as, "there
will be level increases 'in' the Ruins of Kunark", because actually
you could increase your level beyond 50 in the old world without
ever stepping foot "in" Kunark.

Furthermore, the name of the expansion itself, "Planes of Power",
seems to imply that there are special powers within the new Planes.

Interesting.
