This is severely wrong, by the way. Assuming we're talking about pure
casters here they are *bound* to get hit at some point, getting hit
drops their hp way down, and they have no way to heal themselves up
faster (besides necros) since the common regen items aren't wearable
by casters.

Dennis is speaking from his experience, but his experience is with a
necro, which already has accelerated mana regen and several other
advantages the other pure casters don't.

Mana is useless when it comes to twink speed. You don't kill much
faster with lots of mana, you just go longer between meds.

What would really make casters twinkable is reasonable mana regen
enhancing items (flowing thought). Yes, *those* are real easy to come
by, aren't they....

Maybe we just have different ideas of what a real twink is. My
favorite twink is totally decked, fungal tunic, CoF, velious armor
etc. My enchanter is also in darn good gear - good enough for 215 int
and numerous hp items. However, my enchanter could not solo
appreciably faster than an untwinked one could - somewhat safer, but
not faster. My ranger, on the other hand....

Being a twinked caster was sure a godsend for the groups I got in,
though. I could neutralize pulls twice or three times larger than an
untwinked enchanter could simply because it took me so long to run out
of mana. I'd feel bad about that but there are virtually no low level
enchanters for exactly the reason we're talking about anyways -
they're virtually the same twinked or untwinked and that is annoying
for twinkers. :-)

It increases what they are capable of handling but it *doesn't*
appreciably improve the speed in which they level. Not to the extent
twinking the hell out of a melee does.

You can solo something a little bit higher in level, getting more exp
per kill... at the cost of higher downtime per kill. It probably tips
on the side of being faster, but not to the extent equipment on a
melee does.
