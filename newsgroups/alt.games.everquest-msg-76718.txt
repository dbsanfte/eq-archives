If you're looking for the fastest way to level up, it's rarely going
to be the best way to have fun.

In terms of having fun, the most fun I have is when grouped up with
people whose company I enjoy. Always be on the lookout for people
whose company you enjoy, who are of the same level range as you, and
who play about as often. Make judicious use of your friends list. Look
for a guild whose greenspam you will enjoy.

How to level quickly depends entirely on where you start. I can get an
untwinked Iksar to level 12 in one session by making judicious use of
the XP-giving quests, but would be at a loss for how to do it with a
dorf.
