*shrug* Warriors are damage dealers, but they're they only ones designed to
take punishment.  So I guess both of us are wrong and AGI is their primary
stat (increases AC).

For doing damage STR is the most important.  There's no debate from me that
STA is also important...but that's what "zing" is for (the invigorate line
of spells).  Clerics, druids, enchanters, bards, paladins, rangers, and
shaman get them.  Only druids, shaman, bards and enchanters (10pts) get a
STR spell, and STR is ALWAYS needed, and zing for only drawn-out fights.
