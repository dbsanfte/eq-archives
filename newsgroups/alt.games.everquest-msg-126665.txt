This is the second time I have seen this asserted here.  I've got a 52
Paladin, a 38 Paladin, and a 32 Warrior and I've noticed _no_ jump at
levels 30 (been there three times), 40, and definitely not at 50
(I was soloing the same mobs thru the last half of 49 and the first
half of 50, no skill changes, no gear changes, no change in the
difficulty of the battles).

Level-based changes in damage output I've observed are:
1) when using weapons with base damage over 10 there's a jump at L10
2) when using weapons with base damage over 14 there's a jump at L20
3) at L51 melees get onto the post-50 damage table
4) there are incremental damage bonus changes starting at L28 (easily
recognized with a log parser even before they added them to the UI)
5) the very gradual (level+skill+strength)-based change to max
damage that applies starting at L20 (and possibly before).  I've never
seen a verifiable formula for this one, but it is quite clear from my
experience and the reports of others that higher level, higher skill,
and higher strength all will boost your max damage, seemingly
proportional to their increase.  It'd be mighty tedious to really nail
this one down accurately tho, three variables to control and you'd need
a lot of hits in each configuration to be sure you were seeing the
actual max damage result.
