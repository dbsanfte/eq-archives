With the idiot prices the vendors give, its no surprise that items are
staying in circulation and flooding the market diving prices down. Verant
needs to take a course in economics and have a think about its "player run"
economy.
Also, why the hell can I buy bat wings in limitless supply from a vendor but
not bone chips?
Why is a leather tunic sell for more than a split paw tunic with better
stats?
Most of the vendors should have gone out of business long long ago, as all
they do is buy crap from you which they will never sell.
The "economy" is total bullshit. Thanks Verant.
