I meant for "play for a while to get familiar" to mean play once through to
25 or 30 (for DAoC).  I didn't write it well, so it sounds more like I meant
play a week then go out and buy a 50.

The thing is, this is different for different people, and often different
for a given person depending on how many characters they have played before.
In most MMORPGs, the lower level you are, the less different your powers and
abilities are from other characters.  First time I played an EQ character,
it was great fun starting at 1.  The 10th time, it didn't get fun until the
high teens or low 20's.
