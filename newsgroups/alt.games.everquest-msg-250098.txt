This is why I will leave EQ for EQ2; assuming EQ2 lives up to it's
"casual player friendly" tag, if not, hello WoW.

 As a very casual player, I have grown frustrated and at times angry
over game design based on the high end content. As I watched each
expansion raise the bar higher and higher in an attempt to "challenge"
the uber shut-in types, I watched the bar measuring what my guild
could accomplish keep moving ahead of us no matter how high a level we
reached. It took me 4 years to complete the epic because as a member
of a casual player guild (sorry I can't commit to a game over RL)
meant it took a long time to gather enough bodies to push my way
through big MoBs and I felt bad for our druids who needed dragons
pulled down. It took us that long because we needed make up with a
lack of man power with high levels and I can't tell you how we
suffered when many of our high level players were bribed away to uber
guilds offering them the "bling bling" if they join. Granted that says
more about the player then the uber guild, but the ubers knew what
content drove the game.

I am not shocked they ask the ubers for their opinions, they are
likely going to be the only ones left in EQ after EQ2. I have
accomplished all I can, the high end content is beyond my commitment
time. I really have no interest in EQ's future, I look forward to
either EQ2 or WoW.

EQ was great, but the direction of the game and what I enjoy seem to
be going in opposite directions.I can only hope the high end content
is just another component of EQ2 offer nothing better then any casual
player can achieve and beating the "boss" MoB is considered the
accomplishment over some insane piece of uber loot most paying players
will never get.

Just my 2cp
