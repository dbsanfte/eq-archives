Actually my mother went to school with twins named Ima and Ura... last name
Hogg. Not joking. And I myself have met a man named Harry Butts as well as a
woman named Yvonda Dance. What about MoonUnit Zappa? So strange names do
exist in the real world as well as the fantasy one. What do we do about
them? We groan in disbelief that a parent could be that mean and then we
move on... Just think, some people have to work with those people every day.
What are you going to do? Petition your boss to make them change their
names?
No I'm not a proponent for "breaking the rules", just pointing out that
names in the real world interfere with your serenity too. And it is a GAME
and I think we all should lighten up unless it is BLATANTLY offensive. If
you are that easily disturbed you need to play a game where you only
interact with the computer and not with other human beings. They will always
find something to do to piss you off.
I probably said something in this very post that pissed you off and that
will keep this thread going even longer. ]
C'est la vie...
