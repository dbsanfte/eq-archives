Ahhh, mental rants like yours make this newsgroup worthwhile reading )

WTF has Norrath, a fantasy world, got to do with New York ? Wot do you want
next?

Message of the Day: Don't do drugs kids, just say no!
Message of the Day: Today we remember the dead of World War II (millions I
might add, not a few thousand)
Message of the Day: Islam is your friend not your enemy.
Message of the Day: Vote Bush
Message of the Day: Lets bomb Iraq

Etc...

I do not wish to come across as cynical. I share in the sadness and anger
over the atrocity in New York and Pennsylvania. Every civilised country in
the world bowed their heads in remembrance yesterday as they thought of
those that died and the loss they left in so many peoples lives.

But there is no place for this in an online fantasy game.
