No, what you do is you vendor delve a slot so its empty.. THEN VIEWING
the empty slot still you sell it a spider silk.. if you see the spider
silk appear in the slot then buy it back because that vendor has none.
If you DON'T see the spider silk appear in the empty slot the vendor
has more. THEN you refresh the vendor and see what filled the slot and
continue on. You know right away with only emptying one slot if it has
more then.

I destroy everything I delve for the most part, just trying to buy out
the cheapest stacked stuff first. This is FAR MORE LABORIOUS now that
you can't destroy things in a large sewing kit. It used to be SO FAST
to delve when you could.

You have the idea right, sometimes its going to cost you a lot to
delve the slots and sometimes less. I try to pick vendors I KNOW have
a lot for that reason like the gfay newb lift vendor lady is GREAT for

spiderling silks
Low medium and high qual various skins (skin to low for leather pad)
bone chips (for various quests)
