 Plus you can pull some of the mobs down below with spells, eye of zoom,
etc. Basically anything that will aggro them where they are and they'll
come up. It's usually a good idea to have an enchanter when doing that
though is it's easy to get 3-4 mobs if you don't pay attention. Also,
you can get at least 1-2 mobs (usually golems) from the tower if you sit
by the locked door. Maybe more depending on the level of who sits down.

 So without dropping you can actually fight quite a few mobs.
