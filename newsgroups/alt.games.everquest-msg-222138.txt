You need to buy a copy of the spell Cavorting Bones, available on
one of your spell vendors, depending on which race you are.

Then "scribe" the spell; to do this, open your spell book by
clicking on the icon under your memorized spells or by typing
/book , and then take the scroll you just bought from your
inventory and place it on one of the empty squares.  Some time
will pass with a bar at the bottom of your book marking progress,
then the icon will appear in your book.  Now memorize the spell
by taking a copy of that icon and placing it in your memorized
spells list.

Cavorting Bones requires one bone chip, which you might be able
to buy off a vendor if someone has sold them to him, but which
drop off of skeletons and some other undead of all levels; you
should be able to find "decaying skeleton" or something like that
in the newbie zone for your race fairly easily.  Kill one or two
and get a bone chip.

Then just cast the spell normally.  If you fizzle it doesn't use
up the bone chip, when you succede, though, it will, so one of
the first things you kill should be more skeletons, make sure you
always have a supply of chips handy.  When he dies or you log out
or move to another zone, the pet will be destroyed, so you'll
have to make another when ready to fight again, using another
bone chip.  At higher levels, it takes two chips per pet instead
of just one.

Here's a tip; your pet will do damage based either on his own
abilities or on the weapon he is holding, whichever is more.  If
you can get him a weapon, the higher the damage rating on it the
better, you'll significantly improve his damage output for the
next few levels.  You will, however, lose whatever weapon you
give him permanently, when he dies or you log out, its lost
forever... don't give him anything you can't afford to throw
away.  Ideal would be a summoned weapon from a 34+ mage or a Fist
of Bone, available fairly cheaply most of the time from the
vendors in Shadeweaver's Thicket; both have a 10 damage, which
means your pet will be doing up to 20 every time it hits.  By
12th level, this isn't important as your pet will already be
doing that much on his own.
