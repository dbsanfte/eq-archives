If you are smart about it and stay alert, you should have zero trouble
whatsoever. Pick a route, stay out of Kith at night, and just go. If you
have the time and are really paranoid, you can go in hide/sneak mode all
the way. Otherwise, just run with clipping plane way out, avoid all the
mobs you can, and con everything.  The trip can actually be made by any
level one character. The hide/sneak just gives you a leg up on the dicey
spots.

I ran a level one character to Kael Drakkel on Vellious before. And it
was an Ogre with no sneaking around.  As for my trip to the Hole, the
only tough part there was slipping through the gap in the stones at the
entry and swimming in without drowning with my swim skill of five.

Good luck.
