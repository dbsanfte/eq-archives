There's this book about this guy... he had some weird notions about
how people could live together. Normal people figured he was a lunatic
liar and nailed him to a stick.

Whether the story is true or not doesn't matter. I'd prefer not to be
part of that mob or any mob like it, until I've got a real good reason
to think he's a dangerous criminal. Simply having some unusual ideas
about how to live don't cut it.

Most of the criticisms I've seen here are projected. He wants to have
a voice in his childrens partners... and we project Nazi eugenics and
inbreeding. He wants to have multiple wives (possibly simply to spread
the burden of 17th births around or maximize genetic variance in his
offspring) and we project perversion onto him, he wants his kids to
live on the family farm and we project control freak cultist.

Sure it could all be true. But its baseless paranoid fear mongering at
this stage.
