If you are near Qeynos, you can get them at the Enchanter guild with the
help of a human friend (They don't like Barbarians).

If you are in the Freeport area, you can hit the enchanter guild there
(SHOULD sell to you) OR go to the Gypsy camp in Oasis.

IF you have the extra cash, I would recommend buying all the spells off the
vendors for at least the next 3 spell circles.

That will save a LOT of travel time, and you know you'll eventually spend
the cash anyway.  PLUS, banks are closer and more plentiful than spell
vendors.
