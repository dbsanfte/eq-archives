You check with people here and you'll find joined interests with most of
them if you like any of (in no particular order):

The Princess Bride
Monty Python
Star Wars
Terry Pratchett
Mel Brooks

I'd be willing to bet that 95+ % of the people here can quote from one or
more of the above.  And a large percentage (such as myself) can quote from
all of the above.

You can probably also get some good percentages on:

Rocky Horror Picture Show
Tom Lehrer
George Carlin


It is inconcievable that your mother was a hamster and I am your father.
