Well, ok, but it's available to every single video board manufacturer,
which Glide wasn't.  That's what I meant.  That many games targeted
Glide shows how much 3dfx dominated the early years of 3D video cards.

Well, not having kept up on it, didn't OpenGL remain rather stagnant
while DirectX raced past it?  At least as far as implementing features
that the hardware supported.  I also didn't think Glide was really a
subset of OpenGL (but Id Software wrote an OpenGL mini-driver that
wrapped Glide in OpenGL); it just let developers get to EVERY feature
of the Voodoo and Voodoo2, letting them get features in that the
standard drivers didn't support.

I was a big proponent of OpenGL over Direct3D years ago, and I still
am in principal.  But DirectX does what developers want and has
Microsoft behind it.  Also, wasn't there a time when OpenGL drivers
sucked on all cards?  Crashes, difficulty installing, etc.  I don't
remember which card I had when I experienced that.

That's right... that might be the "one major flaw" that I remembered -
gamma adjustment didn't work on anything except 3dfx.  I think there
was also a filtering option which helped image quality tremendously
that wasn't available in the early DX days.  Having a brain fart, I
can't remember what the option was called (it was in the same hard
coded 640x480 option screen that all the other video options were in
back then).

Yeah, and EQ also helped reduce my desire for new hardware... until
Luclin, it didn't really push my video card.  Before EQ, I always had
the latest FPS which "needed" the latest card.  Then my wife bought me
an Xbox. :)  (So yeah, she's cool.)
