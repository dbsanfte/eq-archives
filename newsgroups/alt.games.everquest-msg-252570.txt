Weigh your entertainment value versus the very real possibility you're 
annoying non-stupid people as well.

}If we're talking about deliberate flaunting of civilized and agreed upon

Because, to my knowledge, there exists no rule, real or otherwise, 
governing choice of quote markers.  Please cite one, and then I'll decide 
how real I think it is.  Who knows?  I may even decide to change it, even 
though this is only the second time there's been a complaint about it in 
mmm... 8ish years.
