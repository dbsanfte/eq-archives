Yikes! I never said that line. So I wouldn't have gotten my flag after 
the kill anyway. *sigh*. Well, I have to try again anyway, so it's good 
I asked here.

That part I'd gathered, thanks.

No, we had two chanters in each corner with a tank backing them up. I 
couldn't see it myself, but was told that not a single spider made it 
into the room after Behe became targetable. Good to know, though. Nobody 
mentioned during the raid that they blow up for an AOE, but Ben pointed 
that out in his response so I'll know next time.

Hrmmm... that's pretty much how we did it, except it was all of us split 
into two big groups in two tunnels. But once Behe became targetable, the 
MA rushed in with the clerics for the CHR following him while the 
chanters and off tanks took position in the corners for the spiders. We 
got mowed down by Behe's AOE's, sadly. As Ben pointed out, I'm thinking 
maybe we shouldn't have even bothered with a CHR and just sent everyone 
in on a zerg with every healer who is mass or group heal capable just 
chain casting heals and hoping to outlast the bastard.
