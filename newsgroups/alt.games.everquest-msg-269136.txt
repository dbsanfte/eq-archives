What's kind of stupid is debating two distinctly different issues in a 
single argument. One of you is arguing the merits and justification of 
the mere desire to wear a guild tag while the other is countering by 
arguing the propriety of SoE's methods of implementing it.

Maybe this can be simplified (and settled) by simply stating that:

a) It is quite normal and understandable for people to desire to wear a 
guild tag, and doing so indicates no particular character flaw.

b) SoE's present system for achieving the ability to wear a guild tag is 
certainly controversial. While it makes perfect sense from a RP 
perspective, it certainly adds a high level of tedium to the game for 
those who don't practice RP to any great degree.

Can't we all just get along? ;)
