I came very close to doing that last night.

The friend that has been visiting and keeping me away from EQ (boo hoo) 
went to bed early last night, so I desperately grabb-- er, decided 
casually to sit down and play 5 hour-- er, 5 minutes of EQ while I could.  
So I get back on and am persistently getting my neglected spellcasting 
skills up (who knew conjuration would turn out to be important, right? 
... right?) when a beggar comes up.  I'd seen this guy last week and he 
was begging for stuff.  Here he was, still naked and level 1 and begging.  
I told him to go out and kill stuff and he'd make money fast.  He said 
"but I don't even have a weapon".  Ooookay.  How'd you lose the weapon? 
"I don't know!"  Oh fine.  I get up, wander out, loot a rusty broadsword 
off an abandoned orc corpse, bring it back, and give it to him.

Surprise, surprise.  "Newbie" boy didn't even bother equipping it.  Just 
keep begging.  Well, fine.  I sat there the rest of the night, and when 
he hailed someone, I just sent them a private tell letting them know what 
had happened.  Funny, he got quite a lot of rude /says in his direction 
:D
