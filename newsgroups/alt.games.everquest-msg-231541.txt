exactly. Though my husband [playing a beastlord one level below mine] 
and i generally are the ones forming the basis of a group, with me as 
GL. I dont invite anybody on our invite list, and when i did have the 
situation come up that a member of our group /tell me that the newest 
member was on their ignore list, i very politely sent a /tell to the 
person in question and apologized to them for having to uninvite them as 
a person in group had a problem with their being in the group. i also 
have a policy of not telling the person who they are on the ignore list 
of, that is not my business.

i have to admit, i enjoy being the GL...most people are thrilled to hear 
that there is a cleric in group [and yes, i know other classes can heal 
just as good, bu there is the old habit of wanting a cleric as MH] and i 
have no problem putting together odd groups, like the cleric 3 BL, 
ranger and bard group of a couple weeks ago=) I think we went through 
the place in 45 minutes, and i was tanking because there wasnt any 
healing to do.
