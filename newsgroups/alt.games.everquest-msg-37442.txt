    Not based on the /tell volume I get. ;-) In high-level zones where
grouping is the preferred method of getting XP, agreed. But all those
soloists out there in big, empty outdoor zones.... and the farmers in empty
dungeons. Kaesora is hardly a "risk-free" environment at any level.

    If I'm asked to go to the other side of the world, and I will consider
it, I will state up front my demands: my price, and ports to the zone in
question and from it to the destination of my choice. Unless they agree, I
don't move from the forge/bank/First Torch/loom. Period. And if those
want-to-be-freshly ressed druids and wizards don't like that, they can
pursue the obvious solutions: stop soloing and group with a cleric, or PL
one to 49 on an alternate account and keep it around for resses.
