Neither of them is really that good or that different..
Not much content in either game (duh there new)

You will definitely get bored of both of them if you got bored of EQ1

You level slow in EQ2, and fast in WoW.

EQ2 has more classes to try out.

WoW is the easier game that holds your hand in most of the quests.

WoW has lots of farmers/power levelers.
