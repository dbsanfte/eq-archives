Nope.

The ME installation was less than 2 weeks old. It was part of a
hardware upgrade to my wife's system. I initially chose ME for the
quick boot/shutdown times which my wife considers important.

The driver and apps installations were identical. (All drivers were
saved to a different partition and installed in the same order).

It is about as controlled an experiment as you could accomplish.

Cheers
