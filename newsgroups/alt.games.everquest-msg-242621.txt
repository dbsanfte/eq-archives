Wait until you are a smidgeon higher...

My faithstone is my best friend=) You will get it from me when you pry 
it out of my cold dead fin\\\\wait, i can rez myself=) so I guess you 
will never get it away from me=)

I will normally bind as close as possible to wherever i am hunting, and 
faithstone out to get fresh Kei or whatever I need to do.

On a personal note, I finally killed enough mobs in warrens to get 
amiable paineel faction and a hole key of my very own. now, what odds I 
can get cabilis faction?
