One positive change they did make some time ago was the newbie armor
quests.  I loved doing those.  I started multiple alts of different
races/classes and the newbie armor quests actually made the low levels
enjoyable.  The xp grind didn't feel like such an xp grind since you
were on a mission to obtain something from the effort.  Most of the
quests were balanced pretty well: no extremely long camps and mostly
you could do things alone if you wanted but being grouped helped.
