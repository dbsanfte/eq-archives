How many people have played on FV? I love it, no screeen clogged with /ooc
and /auction. I talk almost exclusively in character and am not made to feel
foolish for it. NO TWINKS!!! Sure there are some drawbacks but since I had
taken time away and all my friends had far surpassed me it was a great
chance for a new beginning. Anyone in the Halas region in the 5th level
range look me up (Yowen, barbarian Beast Lord of the 5th season).
