Actually we get Drowsy at level 22, but it's only worth around 12% then 
IIRC. My main concerns at 2-boxing a beastlord in this duo would be the 
large amount of button clicking to control a mildly disobedient warder,
and our awful healing ability.

We get a 100 HP heal at 39, a 300 at 57 and a 428 at 62, so as a healer
we completely suck.  Although to be fair the Spiritual Light/Radiance/etc
line give a 3 point HP and mana regen bonus at level 44, and 5 at level 52,
and we get Chloroplast at level 55.  This will help with downtime but it
won't save your life in a fight very often, and it doesn't get better later
on.

Our pet heals are pretty good, but if the Ranger or Beastlord melee then 
the pet will always end up last on the hate list so that will be 
irrelevant.
The pet will do good damage in levels just after you get a new one, 39 and 
49 particularly, but in the levels immediately preceding this it will tail
off and the lack of the BL melee DPS will hurt a lot. I found 36 to 39
pretty difficult solo and spent nearly all my time grouped at that point.

A Beastlord does very nice DPS if you keep your warder buffed, concentrate
on positioning both of you and use DD spells, but that doesn't sound easy
to 2 box.  I've never tried it though.

You discussed the SK/Shammy duo in a recent thread and your thoughts there
made a good case - I would be tempted to try that.

Regards
