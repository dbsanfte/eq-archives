I never sit in a corner and practice spell casting, what's wrong with
casting spells on MOB's  to kill them and get exp?  Unless you want to melee
a magic user but I would have to ask you, why be a magic user?  If you are
worried about a particular skill being too low you must not use those skills
a whole lot.  You can always work on off skills while baby sitting some
lowbies (if you do that sort of thing) or just set up a hot key ( /pause
xx,/cast x )
to at least cover 5 at a time.
the mundane things that are monotonous are the trade skills, like archery,
baking and such.  It would be nice if you could do stacks at a time.  Of
course you can't do that in RL so why here.

Just my 2cp
