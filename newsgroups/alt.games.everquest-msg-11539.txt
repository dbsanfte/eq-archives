Level 39: Togor (need to tank out only 30% of the damage)
This makes an enormous difference. With this much of a slowdown, if I 
had a real tank taking damage, at level 45 all the healing was done with 
chloroplast. He did not require even a greater heal while fighting mid-
blues. So a shaman would do a bit worse, but still would be viable if 
there's no other alternative

They don't quite add up like that. I'm sure you understand that 1 point 
of defense is the same as 1 point of dodge...
But if you are counting it up like this, how do you intend to account 
for the fact that a shaman will be wearing 2 shields (so to speak), in a 
tanking conficuration, while a ranger will have none? Will you account 
for the 10 raw ac loss from wearing an FBSS?
