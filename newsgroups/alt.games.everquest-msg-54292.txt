It is none of our business that you should be able to try. It should also be
none of your business if we do not want to let you. It does, Like I have
said tell a lot about a person that does so without asking. If you want to
know the brand name of my watch WHY not ask me? Walking up to any sane
person and looking at his watch that close will make that person wary of
you. For all they know you are sizing them up for a robbery. If you had
simply said "Excuse but I could not help but admire the look of your watch.
Can I ask the brand name or have a closer look?" then it would have not
upset the person unless they were truly neurotic instead of cautious. Then
you would have a reason to call some one neurotic.
