I was away from EQ for about eighteen months, not my choice (I changed 
country of residence four times in that period, and I just didn't own an 
EQ-capable computer. I did keep paying for my account, though). I can take 
you I had the shakes like a heroin junkie... EQ is addictive, there is no 
mistake about that, and yes, you can spend enough time in it that it 
impacts other aspects of your life. I think you are really lucky your wife 
likes EQ too.

Now, there is a flipside to that coin. If you feel that EQ is eating into 
your watching TV, going to movies, etc, it may be only an indication that 
MMORPGs are the most advanced form of entertainment ever, as enabled by new 
technology, and old amusements simply pale in the comparison. There may be 
nothing intrinsically wrong with this, because people also become addicted 
to inferior forms of entertainment, like TV.

But I have to agree with your concern with the time EQ demands. Sometimes, 
I actually take steps to *minimize* the fun I have on EQ: When I know I 
have chores that need taking care of, I will solo rather than group, 
because I know that soloing I get bored eventually and log out, while in a 
group I can lose track of time and play for hours on end.

Anyway, the bottom line is that if you feel that you need a break, you 
*need* a break. On the other hand, if EQ is the most fun that you have in 
your free time, there is little point on feeling guilty about spending your 
free time playing EQ. That's what free time is for, to enjoy it as one 
pleases.
