Well, forgive me if I'm in an uncharitable mood today, but if someone 
tells me that their first motivation on picking up a bag inteded for 
recovery by someone else's alt is to "teach them a valuable lesson" --
rather than, say, greed, malice or just a curious lack of empathy-- they 
will be met with a certain amount of skepticism. I don't think that 
"Actually, I'm doing it for their own good" cuts any more mustard in EQ 
than it does in RL.

And why is he a moron? Only because there are thieves around. If there 
weren't any people ready to run off with their gear, there would be no 
grounds to call person a moron, would there?

On the other hand, the negligible amount of lag caused by the bag 
graphic sitting there hardly seems a worthy justification to cause 
someone that much trouble, it's not like they have been spouting bigoted 
crap over /shout or begging your ears off in Rivervale. Certainly, it 
doesn't seem enough of a transgression to deny them the basic courtesy 
of not touching their stuff for the few minutes it lies there.

/shrug. I don't know, I'm not in the guy's shoes, and it's not my 
problem. My character's name isn't Scourge-of-Impatient-Twinkers 
Thornhide.
