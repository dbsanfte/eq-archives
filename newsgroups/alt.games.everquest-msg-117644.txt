I'm working on yet another log parser for everquest, and I could use
some feedback from real people. YALP includes some nice features such
as;

- It displays your entire log in colour.
- It allows you to search the log for any string.
- It collects damage for every party found in the log file.
- It provides a detailed list of each fights you had.
- It shows all damage in text and graph formats.
- It is one of the fastest EQ log parsers around.

Please visit http://members.shaw.ca/yalp and see for yourself how YALP
stacks up against other EverQuest log parsers.
