    Seems like every warrior wants to go berserk so they can fire this bad
boy off. As a cleric and official naysayer, it's my job to tell them "no, I
keep you safe, and berserk isn't safe". I've become very good at healing
folks when they think they're out of range, stealth-healing by rebuffing,
healing people who strip off all their armour (yeah, that one warrior was
really desperate), and my favourite, landing a CHeal JUST as they pop the
discipline. Remember, as a cleric we have no fun, so you have no fun!

What, me smile?
