Heh, if you liked Nausicaa, you should really hunt down the manga for it.
The anime is really jut an abbreviation, and the manga is where
Miyazaki-sensei fully developed his ideas.  Of course, many things transpire
differently, but it really is worth the read.  Many people consider it to be
outright literature.

The manga of Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa falls in between the anime, and
Mononoke Hime when it comes to it's tone.  A bit more philosophical than the
anime.
