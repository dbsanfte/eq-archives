What I have:

I have a level 62 4 School mage on MorningThaw server that I want to trade
for a Char on any non-pvp server on Everquest. My mage has all spells
learned but lvl 7s, has war 7s learned. He's in a UBER monarchy that does
quests once or twice a week. Also on the account is a level 42 Swordsmen,
and a UBER 3-schooled Archer complete with GSA and a Comp bow. The mage can
solo Umbris Shadows 4 at a time, walks through Heromancer's Hall like he
owns the place. Spec in Mana Con, Arcane, and Run Trained in 4 schools, and
has heal.

What I'm looking for:

I'm mainly looking for a Necromancer, Enchanter, or a Cleric on any non-pvp
server. I will consider any other class, but the level must be around 50. I
will also accept striped accounts. Please e-mail me if interested!
