Thanks you one and all who replied

I think it's fair to say that the majority of opinion is AGAINST going to
the DL's

can i follow up on that and ask where then???

Level 40 pally (slightly twinked) majority of time playing during day so not
usually the biggest choice of group!!! and end up solo (hence DL's better
choice of group??)

I'm starting to think TOFS would be a viable solo site (with Lguk and SolA
as backups???) any input on this??

many,many thanks for all the input
