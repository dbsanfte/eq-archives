1.  How does returning work? I think you can reclaim your characters for
some
period of time, but about how long?  Do you just log in and pay again?

2. After the long debate about it a few days ago, do you guys prefer a reply
at
the bottom, or at the top. At least that is my guess as to what "top-poster"
vs.
"bottom-poster" was about.
Thanks
