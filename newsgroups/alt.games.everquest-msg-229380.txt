Ah, but I was fear-stunned at the time...so I definitely couldn't get
off a nuke.  I keep Sicken and Blast of Frost memmed to get me aggro
when I want it, along with always casting Drowsy when there's no
Shaman along.  And actually my pet did come and beat on it, as I
mentioned, and must have gotten several procs off because its health
went down pretty fast while I was just sitting there waiting for the
fear-stun to wear off.  The procs must have stopped before it tried to
gate though.

I actually have the exact same hotbutton as you do.  In addition, my
assist hotbutton goes

/assist name
/pet back off
/pet attack

just to be sure my pet joins in when I fight.  Although I don't
include /attack because it was giving me problems before with
switching to the closest mob rather than the one that I'm supposed to
be assisting.  Perhaps I should put /attack before /assist?  It was
after before I removed it.

Thanks to everyone for the suggestions!  I've done a mir and a mmc
since then, both wins, but no gating this time.  Joined a group going
to Lower Guk last night to get the nodrop mask for bards and rogues
that makes them look like dark elves.  It's an amusing story, although
I won't repeat all of it here since I am sure it would be familiar to
nearly everyone but me.  To sum it up, our cleric died 4 times (3 on
the way in, once on the way out), the rogue died twice, and the
paladin and bard died once (all on the way out).  Yes, again, I
escaped dying, although I would have twice if I hadn't picked up a
temperance in PoK.  (I wasn't alone this time, as the Shaman made good
her Gate and escaped.)  And my second near-death experience was me
trying to get people's corpses without backup, a very stupid move.  I
got rooted and slowed by a wizard while getting beaten on by its nukes
and a knight, and still managed to make it to the Upper Guk zone
before dying.  I think that character is blessed somehow...if it had
been my Ranger he would have died very quickly (as expected).  But
then afterwards we went to a nearly empty Dreadlands and did very
nicely there with an extra cleric, getting me to 36 and the bard to
40.  The original cleric made back his exp, the rogue had his mask,
and we were all happy.

Game on,
