Good quote. I don't recognize it though, and I'm pretty well read of 
Heinlein's work. Title?

In response though, the problem I'm seeking to gaurd against is 
highlighted...

"Social responsibility above the level of family,
  or at most of tribe, requires imagination - devotion, loyalty, all the
  higher virtues - which a man must develop himself"

Its like the old proverb about giving the man a meal versus teaching him 
to fish. Giving him a meal isn't going to get you anywhere long term, 
but if you teach him to fish he can feed himself for life.

Keeping him off drugs is a big step to teaching him to fish. You can't 
teach someone to fish, while they are chasing a heroin fix, or spaced 
out on a couch watching their fingernails grow -- and they won't develop 
any higher virtues like this either.
