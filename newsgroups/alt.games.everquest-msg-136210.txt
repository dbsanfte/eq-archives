Take 'em, please.  Don't worry about returning them anytime soon!  We
do have some very good MPs in there, but put them all together and
they behave like 2 year-olds.  While this has some advantages, it
would be nice if Question Period did not become "fling insults at each
other" period.  Anyone who is a fan of daytime soaps would probably
like tuning in to the federal parliament cable channel.
