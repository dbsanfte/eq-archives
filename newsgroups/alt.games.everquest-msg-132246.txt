Yep, that's what worked for Dark Ages.  I'm willing to bank that people also
want good.

Actually, I haven't played the game in two months, I doubt that qualifies me
for "die hard status."  Now, if you want something worth being diehard
about, check out http://www.megatokyo.com (heh, sorry, I'm bored, and in a
punchey mood, so I figured why not... btw, that has absolutely nothing to do
with this topic, but neither do many of hm's arguments, so what the heck).

Actually, the three local gaming stores have rather imposing "Walls of EQ"
(insert oppresive music here, or maybe something from The Wall)  that
waaaaay overshadow every other MMORPG combined, NWN included.

Hmm, you seem to be at odds with Verant when they say that EQ2 =/= EQ, as
well as being in conflict with later parts of your post.  Here you state
that it's the same game, but later you recite the changes that they've said
they're going to make (already published), which will likely have a very big
impact on gameplay.  Sorry, but those two things don't jive.

You're most likely right there.  It only took a little digging to find the
story, but Verant still has made no attempt to run a true storyline.

Ok, so it seems you don't read very carefully.  I stated right up front that
it was an arbitrary number.  Whether 1 mil is the break even point or not
(which is subject to speculation) really doesn't matter since my number was
imaginary (well, not really, since it didn't include the square root of -1,
but you get the point).  Adjust my number to two million if you wish, the
point still stands.

SWG is already accounted for.  Anyways, SWG isn't really competing against
EQ.  Different genres.

All of those things could easily be taken as improvements or nerfs.  I
especially don't like the idea of not having all my stuff available at any
bank.  I'm not alone in this.  Nor am I just chomping at the bit to have my
items decay.  Your "improvements" may end up killing EQ2 before it's
launched.

Ah, yes, the good ol' public... odd how it asks for things it didn't even
know it wanted.

It can if it has the user base to keep it profitable.

The ones that Verant decided not to impliment for game design reasons?

No, they see an extra source of revenue, and they decided to go for it.  If
Verant is in such a pinch that they _need_ that small amount of revenue to
keep afloat, then it won't be EQ2 that kills EQ, it will be Verant going
under (does anyone know if Arthur Anderson does their accounting?).

Which is completely irrelevent to your main idea.  That's happening without
competition.  Sounds more like a problem with Verant's craniums being
inserted in their kiesters, rather than EQ being an ageing game.
