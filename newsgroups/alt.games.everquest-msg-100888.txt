"Well  when twinking my ranger i decided i wanted him to have a  nice  1hs
weapon and i was goin to spend 3k max <on my server prices are whacked fngi
goin for 50k>
So i did a little research and  came to the conclusion  that a centi LS
was the better of the  3  with a ratio  of 1.9 8str 8sta
against lammys 2.1 ratio with 6str 6sta and 20hps and  wurmy's 1.6 5ac 5str
5svm"

Until level 51 or so, you want the Wurmslayer in your main hand. There is no
weapon that will outdamage the WS in your pain hand up until lvl 51, when
the main hand damage bonus kicks in. Also, you don't want agro as a ranger
so using a wurmslayer let's you deal tons of damage while flying under the
mob's agro radar.

After that I'd go with a lammy main hand and a centi ls off hand.
