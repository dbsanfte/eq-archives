Sit on the sidelines by myself not talking to anybody or observing the game
that is still happening?  Or one that would allow me to wander away for hours
at a time at my discretion while the game continues uninterruped?  No, I
wouldn't want to pursue such a sport.

Luckily, I can't think of one that fits that description.  (And don't tell  me
any game where I'm a reserve on the bench, because then I'm not actually
playing the game... not to mention that sports have pretty different
objectives than video games.)

Who said anything about practices?

Of course, the game is still very much going on during those silent pauses, so
I don't see it as relevant.  I can't very well get up and wander away from a
chess game for a few hours and expect the game to continue, can I?  Much less
expect to *win* the game or progess during that time.  Yet, that is the way
you and Lance seem to think EQ should work.

That's fine!  I wasn't arguing about taking a break from the game for a while.
But what you and Lance are proposing is actually *playing the game* when
you're not even in the room!  Or even awake!  There's nothing stopping you
from finding a safe little corner and going afk for a while, but at that point
you should not expect (or be able) to advance your character any further.  If
you find the game so horribly boring that you don't want to be in the same
room with it as you play it, IT'S TIME TO FIND A NEW GAME.

That was my point.

Those things you mention are inherent parts of the overall games.  No, they
may not be the "best" parts, but again, if you can't be bothered to take part
in those parts of the game, then it's not a game for you.

No, but I only play games that I find entertaining ("amusing" as it was put
above).  However, I think *I* should be the one playing, not mindless AI that
I only told to /guard here.  And please, no accusations of dictating how you
should play the game, for at that point you're no longer playing the game.

That there are instances in the game where you can do this only points to a
broken part of the game, and it should be fixed if enough people are doing it
(and if it can be fixed in a way that won't break the game for the rest of
us).
