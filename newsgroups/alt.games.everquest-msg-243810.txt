I just want to verify, if I get 10 successes at each LDoN camp and talk to
the right people, it upgrades my Adventure Stone to a charm with resists?

And if I get 80 successes at each camp, it upgrades to a super charm with
the same resists?

And there are 5 camps with 2 different dungeons off of each camp with 5
different types of adventure and 2 degrees of difficulty for each dungeon?
5 x 2 x 5 x 2 = 100 different possible LDoN experiences?

Thanks.
