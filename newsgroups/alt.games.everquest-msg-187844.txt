There are LOTS of zones.  If your staying in PC at 27, you are staying
way too long.  It is a great zone to 24 then I move to Netherbian.

If you want to find groups, buy LoY and use the group tool.  I see
lots of individual players with LFG on, many low level, most not in
PC.

Depends on server I guess.  I quadded specters in Oasis quite a bit
and there were always groups there on the orc highway.  Same in Nro
hunting bandits.  Don't know about Crushbone or South Karana since I
don't go there.

PC exp is roughly equal to Highkeep.  Except, of course, Highkeep is a
tiny zone that still has waiting lists at times.
