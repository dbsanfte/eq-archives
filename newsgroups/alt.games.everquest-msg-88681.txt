No question a powerful combo for killing. There are some nice
places where you can fear kite and there would be non-stop killing.

One downside I see is that if you venture into dungeons you
will have to watch your pets like a hawk. One bad path by one
of your pets and its bye bye to all of you. All of you should have
gate memmed at all times while you are in a dungeon. When
you get to a new dungeon work your way in slowly, learning
the pathing as you go.

Might want to think about exchanging a mage for a shaman.
This will give you Sow and the shaman gets a pet at 35 also.
