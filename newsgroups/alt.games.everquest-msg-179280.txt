Yes, more HPs per bandage.  It will help later, especially if you solo a 
lot.  There's a knife that Cara Omica in ToFS drops that procs a "summon 
bandage" spell ( Embalmer's Skinning Knife? ).  I suggest you get hold of 
one and work on your piercing ( which you should be doing anyway ).  If 
you're on Karana, send me a tell, I probably have an extra one of these 
knives somewhere, unless I sold it on my trader.

Mages can summon bandages, too.  See if you can find a mage that isn't 
doing anything and ask them politely to summon you some and offer a small 
donation.  They are no-rent and will disappear after you are disconnected 
for a certain period of time, though, so you can't keep them from session 
to session.

What's rel nice is when you get higher level, you can run through a newbie 
zone and see someone sitting after a close fight.  With your high skill, 
you can bandage them up to 50% with 1 bandage.  I duoed with a mage friend 
and he bandaged me up when I got smacked up.  His skill is maxxed.  It 
definitely can opportunities to help later on the levels.
