Ya know one view is as silly as the next. I will bet the farm the BoD
of Sony know very well they have a game called everquest and the like.
You dont get to those levels by being stupid. OTOH these bad decisions
are being made by those guys that show up at fan fare , why everyone
treats them like gods I will never understand. The crap pulled in the
last year damn near deserved a hanging, maybe next time.
