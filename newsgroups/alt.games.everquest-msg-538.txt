You apparently dealt with the good GM's, of which there are many. .One of
whom comes to mind was Dynan of Fennin Ro.  He was always quick to deal with
problems, and was a nice all around guy.   Unfortunately he either left
Fennin or was removed of his position.

To the contrast, there are bad GM's out there, one of whom whose name I
won't mention, refused to assist in the retrieval of corpses after the
server crashed while we were killing FG's on a Naggy raid.  When the server
came back up, we were greeted to a full respawn of FG's.  Not pretty.
