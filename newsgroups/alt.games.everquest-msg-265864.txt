Here yes. Elsewhere I'm focusing on instancing to control encounter 
parameters. (Because I like the idea the some encounters are just me vs 
the volcano, and other encounters are just my little group. An encounter 
that I have to solo at 30th will be challenging long after it would be 
trivial to take with a group of 4 30ths, and less than trivial if I have 
my 2nd box 66th level Necro beside me.

'Sufficient content' is more expensive than an 2nd instance. Old world 
everquest plus kunark has enough different content to make getting from 
from 1-50 an interesting trek, and you'll still miss stuff.

The last thing it needs is to have 5x the number of zones. Especially as 
it won't even prevent any particular area from getting transiently 
overcrowded if for any reason it becomes a fad to go there.

Please clarify what you mean by spawnable quest.
