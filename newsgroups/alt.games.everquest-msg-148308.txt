The game has been out for 3+ years and there's no sense in changing
the class now...  But this may spur some interesting discussion, which
is what I am seeking.  The topic I want to pursue is not class envy or
even class balancing.  It is class definition.

When I think of a monk, I think of a master of toe-to-toe melee
disputes.  I think of Bruce Lee and martial arts.  Yet when I think of
an Everquest monk, I think of hitting the attack button once and then
positioning myself to attack the mob.  Every now and then I hit a
special attack button.

While the special attack animations are very cool, it's just not
enough to give me the sense of being a master of martial combat.  At
the high end of the game, I get a higher damage output table than a
warrior.  But that is no brainer work.  How does that make *me* a
better melee machine than a warrior?  All I did was hit the attack
button, which is exactly what the warrior did!

With other classes, I feel well defined.  As a wizard, I feel like I
can burn anything to a crisp, at the cost of being very fragile.  I
must concentrate on making sure I avoid melee contact, whether soloing
or grouping.  As a cleric, I have any number of tools available to
mitigate damage and keep the party alive.  It's my choice as to what I
feel is the best way to keep the party alive.  But as a monk, I'm
mostly just hitting the attack button.

Feign death does wonders for class definition.  It definitely gives a
sense of being a monk.  Having FD makes me feel like a monk. 
Unfortunately, that feeling ends as soon as the attack button is
pressed.

So if I working for Verant back in 1999, here's what I would have
pressed for:  Expand the monk special abilities.  I would have given
monks the ability to use sequences of special attacks, with some
sequences being more potent than others in certain situations.  This
would give some brainwork to the monks during combat to maximize their
melee output.  It would also make the monk *look* more like a master
of melee.  Perhaps give some special abilities that debuff the melee
stats of the mob in some way, much like when you attempt to disarm a
mob.

An old school analogy would be street fighter or mortal kombat.  There
was a lot of moves available in those games.  But if you learn
particular sequences of attacks, you achieve higher DPS.  Yet those
sequences would not work against all opponents.  In other words, the
combat required a good deal of brain activity to succeed.

I think something like this would be a good thing.  It would add more
fun to the class.  However, this could potentially give rise to outcry
from other classes due to the further increased DPS of monks.  The
solution to this would probably be to lower the damage tables of
monks, requiring a monk to use some brainwork to get back up to the
"balanced" DPS.

Again, I'm not asking for a change.  Just pondering how things would
be.  It would just be nice to have the feel of working hard to be a
true melee master, instead of having it handed to us through damage
tables.
