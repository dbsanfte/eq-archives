Having gotten my druid to 48, I'm finding the game at this level pretty dang
boring.  A snoozer.  Doing about the same thing no matter what zone I'm in.
I'd taken a couple of weeks off from the game, and when I came back it took
me about 5 kills to be bored again.

On the other hand, I pulled out my poor abandoned lvl 10 SK and am having a
blast with him.  Druid's gone on the back burner now ... may play him again,
may not.  Too early to tell.

Anyone else experience this kind of reaction to the game past about lvl 45?
