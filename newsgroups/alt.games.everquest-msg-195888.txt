Very interesting.  The two formulas work out to be very close.  I think that
your formula is the correct one, mainly because it rounds down, since this
is much easier to program.  My formula ends up being the more conservative,
which would explain why I never noticed a problem with it.  Whenever it says
someone can get XP in a group, it's true.  It just fails to predict the
lowest level that can group, and then it's only off by one.

I would be interested in hearing the results of others in-game testing.  I
have listed the levels of the higher character below where there is a
difference between the two formulas.

11, 12, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61 and
64

For example, using your formala, a level 37 character can group with as low
as a level 24 character, with my formula it's level 25.  So the test would
be to have a level 24 character group with a level 37 character, and see if
they get XP.
