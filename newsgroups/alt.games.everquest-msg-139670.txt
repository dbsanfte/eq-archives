Never.  No reason to.  No it isn't any good.

Here's how it works.  You mem it, it takes what seems like
forever to pop up.  Then you cast it, if you happen to have
a pearl on you.  Eats the pearl.  Small price to pay, you
figure.

Now, if your target dies, he has a chance of having a heal
cast on him instead, just in time to save him.

Its only a chance, and not all that good of one.  Usually
he just dies.

When it Does work, it has all the effect that casting
a GHeal on the guy would have.  Thats right, he's
still got his position on top of the hate list plus the
low HP aggro.  So since he died first time, whats
to stop him dying the second?

The spell wears off in an hour, and usually it does,
or else it failed.  I cast it a lot shortly after I got it,
and think it worked and actually saved someone
about three times.

Now I cast it sometimes when someone has died,
or seems very likely to die soon, as a purely symbolic
gesture.  Here, I'm spending pp, time, and mana
on giving you and extra shot at living thru this, even
though its not likely to work.

Best targets?  Rangers; they die a lot, and might get a
jolt off to lose aggro after, or might manage a getaway
if they have SOW up and are pulling.  Monks; they
die a lot too, and often its while failing FD, this may
give them a second shot at it.  Enchanters, as they might
get that mez off given a second chance.  Clerics, who
might get DA off, the MA, who might have a CHeal
hit him just too late... why, if this spell worked a lot
more often than it does, all the key elements of your
raid should have it!

I do  not yet have Divine Intervention.  This spell
works like Death Pact, but casts a full heal instead
of the little baby one.  This would drastically improve
its usefulness... but I don't see it cast much, which
leads me to suspect that like Death Pact, it rarely
goes off at all.
