My opinion is that I would rather have one 50 level character than than
three level 15's. You we see some people here list 3 or 4 characters
they play with none of them being over 30. Life beyond 30 is much better
than under.
There's a guy on my server I group with sometimes that has two accounts
and two puters running at the same time. He only has one character on
each his highest being 56. His higher level char drags his lowest level
guy around and guards him while he plays. In his case, having two
characters seems to be a lot of fun.
