Ouch!  Well, for that particular bit anyway.  :)

Still, it's off on a bit of a tangent from the original focus of
the "rant":  KEI effectively makes the interdependency of the
classes a one-way deal in most circumstances.  Melees depend on
casters to be effective, while casters not only can dispense with
melees they are in many cases burdened (i.e. receive less xp and
loot over time) should they group with melees.  The player who
takes a melee class as his/her main, unless they start play as a
member of a guild where everybody has chosen/accepted roles with
with the specific intent of maximizing the effectiveness of the
guild, has crippled him/herself in comparison to the player who
has a caster main.  With class balance as it is, and the ready
availability of spell focus items and KEI on "mature" servers,
comparing a melee main to a caster main is analogous to comparing
a dyslexic cripple to a college educated athlete in RL.  (If the
melee main is an SK, BL, or Ranger it would be fair to substitute
"trade-schooled" for "dyslexic" in that comparison).  And let's
be honest James, the fact that an "uber"-caster can then make
melee twink with a fungi tunic, good haste, and excellent weapons
contradicts nothing I'm saying here, rather it _supports_ my
argument.

P.S.  I'm surprised you didn't jump on my mis-characterization of size
of hp pool as being rarely important.  Tho it's not routinely important
until high level, the existence of CH and iCH does make it matter if
the melee has the luxury of grouping with a Cleric or a 58+ Druid or
Shaman.  And for Bandaging size of hp pool is crucial, given the
crippling 50% limit on that skill (excepting high level characters
with multiple AA levels devoted to that particular skill, of course).
