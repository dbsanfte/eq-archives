I need help on the Vah Shir Shaman quest where you make the sweet

I have placed the two flasks of sweet water into the cask and have
tried to give it to Spiritist Fehril. The problem is, he won't accept 
it. Any recommendations on how to get him to accept? Links to sites with
SPOILER guides are also accepted. :)
