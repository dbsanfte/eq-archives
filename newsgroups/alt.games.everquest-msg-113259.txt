Depends who you play with. Without knowing what you have its hard to say, but
my advice would probably be along the lines of:

Haste, Weapon ratio, regen, AC, hp, wisdom, dex

Probably dont need to worry TOO much about resists just yet... If you tank
a lot you may want to move AC up a lil.

Now, untwinked, its a while since I was 50 but.... hmm, a reasonable outfit
might be....

Wurmslayer, lupine dagger/LSOEE/Centi SS
Swarmcaller
Woodsmans staff (if these are cheap on your server, they are *insanely* 
good weapons... dont worry about your 2hb, just work it up)

Armour wise.....
barbed ringmail might be a lil hard for you yet, hmm.. treeweave, tolans
arms, gaunts and helm, kromrif military leggings, sebilite scale gear,
etc...

Regen you can probably only aim for a ceremonial iksar BP right now, but its
still useful if not as much so as a fungi. Haste the old favourite the FBSS
is cheap and good.

If you have good guild support the cloak of truth quest in luclin is a very
nice ranger item... might be a lil high for you yet, depending on if you're
on the low or high side of your guilds levels.

I know its kind of fuzzy but so was the request ;) Of course planar items
are still *reasonable*, the revultant whip and thorny vine dont suck although
they're no longer "top flight".

Also, if you havent been, now's probably time to start thinking about using
archery a lot - every time you pull, etc, so you have some basic skill for
when trueshot hits... Once you get trueshot you WILL want a velium bow from
Dragon Necropolis, although that will be overkill just now.
