So rather than even having the option of getting somewhere to play with
friends, go play something else?  Gotcha.

How is it practically the same?  You have two options of getting
somewhere, the long, 'more immersive' way, or the shorter way.  If
nothing is being forced on you then how is only having one way the same
as both ways?

It wasn't my way, I didn't even bother playing until a couple months
before EQ2 came out.  What I don't understand is how can people want
more timesinks in a game that already includes a ton of them?  I did
make a few runs that were recommended to me by some friends that have
played forever - just to see how it was.  Even without the boats, the
runs were long, and I have to agree they were cool the first time I did
them.  There is no way that I would want to have to do that every time
I wanted to go meet a group though.
