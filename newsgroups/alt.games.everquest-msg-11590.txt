You have to kill all the fire bettles you can find in Misty.  This
will get the klicknacks (sp) and then kill them. then finally  the
royal family will spawn.  Once you kill them the Queen will then show
her face.

She does not spawn much in Misty because people go to the guard wall
ASAP and never kill enough fire bettles to make her spawn.
