You are probably right, i have seen some young shardwurms passing the portal
and also in the smaler passage between the two open areas, even seen some feral
cave kodiaks there, they shure look nasty.

Will the coldain and/or coldain tracking wolf attack the tizmak i'm fighting?
like the guards in nektulos for instance, nice to know if i'm in trouble 
anytime, not shure if my feign death works :)
