Yep, the skill in question is Blacksmithing, and one of the easiest 
things to do in that skill is sharpen a rusty sword; costs a few coppers 
to do, and upgrades the weapon to a tarnished sword, which will do the 
same damage per swing, but swing a little bit faster, so you'll get more 
hits in a minute.  Technically, that means the delay is lowered, I think 
by 2 in every case.

As a side note, to the extent this is true, this means you get more bang 
for your buck by sharpening a fast light weapon than a slow big one, 
because the change in speed isn't proportional: a weapon going from 50 
delay to 48 delay gets a 4% improvement in speed, but one going from 25 
delay to 23 delay gets an 8% boost in speed

Its been long enough since I last did this that I don't remember the 
precise details, but you'll need a sharpening stone, which you can 
purchase in several places including North Freeport.  You put the rusty 
weapon in a forge (free standing container you see in lots of city 
zones, again there's one in NFreeport, in this case near the bank) along 
with the sharpening stone, and combine.  If that recipee doesn't work, 
then add a flask of water; store bought, not foraged or summoned.  Most 
forge combines include a flask of water... but sharpening might not.

I believe that a failure will destroy the stone (and water if some was 
needed) but not the weapon.  But again, its been forever since I did 
this.  Stones (and water if needed) cost a couple coppers each, so no ig 
deal.

Some rusty weapons can't be sharpened in this way... naturally not rusty 
maces, but I think some that you might think were sharpenable as well. 
Best way to find out is just to try, if there's no recipee you lose 
nothing (a big improvement on the original way this sort of thing worked)
