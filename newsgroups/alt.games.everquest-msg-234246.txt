Close, but there's no known ceiling, and there are effects that are 
described in lucy as raising or lowering you much more than 100 points, so 
it certainly isn't 100.  If there was a ceiling, how would the monster 
decide who to attack if more than one person reached it? :) (Ok, it's 
simple, he'd attack the one in a robe. :) )

Taunt is the only thing that will move you all the way to the top of the 
hate list (as opposed to raising you a set amount on the hate list).  Mem 
blur, FD, and Evade reset your hate to zero, on the rare occasion that 
they work. :)

}As you do more damage or healing (pissing them off) you're

There's no evidence that what you do to gain hate lowers the hate of 
others.  There are some spells (Boggle for encs, Jolt for Rangers, 
Concussion for Wizards) that lower your hate a set amount.  There are a 
variety of spells, item effects, AAs, and disciplines that affect the 
'hate modifier', ie, make you get 1.5x the normal hate for an action, or 
0.75x.
