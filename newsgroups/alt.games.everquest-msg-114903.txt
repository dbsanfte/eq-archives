All 3 do.

STR affects your maximum hit. ie if you have 100 STR and your max hit is
100, you will hit from 1-100.  If you have 150 STR, your range will now be
1-150  (not accurate numbers, just an example)

As your kick skill gets higher, you hit faster, and more accurately.

As you level, your skill cap raises, so you need to level, to keep raising
your kick skill.
