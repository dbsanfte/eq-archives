Nope, they're not.  They're melee dps, in the same zone as Rangers.
Paladins, Shadow Knights and Warriors are tanks.  Berzerkers are DPS.

That's not to say that with excellent gear, like Rangers in excellent gear,
they can't tank, because they can.  But it's not something they're built to
do.

You have to get hit for defence increases, try getting hit more.

Defence skillups based off AGI not WIS/INT.

Get hit more (and only DB+ mobs count)

Defence goes up slowly for all classes, it's harder for non-tanking classes
to raise because you traditionally get hit less often.
