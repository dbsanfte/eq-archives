Y'know, I've been thinking about this... best cash I ever made at my 
level was the derv camps in North Ro.  But they're green to me now, so I 
can't really hog a camp without being called on it.  OTOH I can't group 
because nobody I grouped with would get any experience.  I've thought 
about offering buffs in exchange for rights to the bronze weapons but I 
doubt people are stupid enough to fall for it :)

But where else can you make that kinda cash?  I'm bored of fighting and I 
want to do some more tailoring, but a) the spells from level 19 left me 
with exactly 1 gold and 1 silver piece, and b) thanks to the price nerfs, 
I can no longer break even on my tailoring.  And who the hell auctions 
"WTB studded leather armor" in EC? :P

As for soloing, I prefer it to spending hours looking for a group only to 
find a *bad* group, or find a good group only to have it break up about 
an hour later.  It just doesn't seem worth the trouble.
