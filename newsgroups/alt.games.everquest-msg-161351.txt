Actually, during 2000's presidential campaign, this is the
only point that really FUCKING PISSED ME OFF!!!!!

George H.W. Bush having a son named George W. Bush
DOES NOT FUCKING MAKE HIM A FUCKING "Jr." AFTER
HIS FUCKING NAME, FUCKFUCK!!!

At the same time, Al Gore, Sr. NAMED HIS FUCKING SON
AL FUCKING GORE, Jr. (well, maybe not "fucking").  Al, Jr's
son is named Al Gore, III.

Al Gore IS a "Jr.," while GW Bush, is NOT a "Jr."  Why so
many ignorant FUCKING IDIOTS insist on calling him
Jr. helps me automatically qualify the person as either
a never-argue-with-the-media-because-they're-impartial
naieve (sp?) lib, or just a complete and total fucking
moron in every sense of the word.

I hate to get so pissy about it, but that particular subject
was the topic of a debate in college about bias in the
media and how things are skewed to alter perceptions
of complete and total fucking morons...or some title
remarkably similar to that...
;-)
