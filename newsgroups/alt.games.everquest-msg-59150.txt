OK, for some reason I thought you were level 60.  You guys get a good
charm at 53, right?  I'm not sure of the level cap of your mobs, but I
just know that as a bard I turn green with envy watching you charm
stuff 51+.  I don't raid Kael, since I know the giants are the real
good guys in Velious, but generally swapping spells out with mobs
there is a good way to get smacked upside the head.  Of course if I
find myself in a position where I don't have the right song memmed I
can usually find a pot or corner to hide behind while I fix that.
Compared to have slowly bards mem songs i wouldn't think that it would
be an issue for classes with meditate capped a bit higher than 10.
I'm hoping that I can get my hand on a high-level enchanter for a
while, because I truly love crowd-control, and can't stand knowing
that enchanters can do it more effectively that I can.  (Even if they
do it with a lot less panche.)
