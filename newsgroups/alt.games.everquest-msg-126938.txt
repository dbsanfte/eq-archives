::cackle:: it's very amusing to see beggars show up and start shouting 
for donations only to get yelled at that nobody has anything more than 
the beggar does anyway.  Although tonight there *were* a couple high 
levels in GFay.  In response to the begging they started yelling out 
that if anybody had anything to donate to a level 40-something wizard or 
30-something ranger, they'd be very, very grateful.
