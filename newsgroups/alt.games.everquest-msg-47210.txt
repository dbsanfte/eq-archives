I have the means to capture video clips from my VCR, TV and DVD.  Once my
moving is completed I will rent this movie and capture it for those that
wish to see it (assuming the clip is on the one I rent).  That is unless
someone beats me to the draw, which is cool with me. :)

I will place it at:

Check with it time to time since I don't know when this never ending moving
process will be completed. <sighs>
