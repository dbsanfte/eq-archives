This is the biggest problem with this change I can see. There are a lot of
quests I've completed at higher level and recieved an item I've already
outgrown or have something better. I sell the item or give it to someone who
can use it. In fact, I have two pieces right now I was planning to give to a
guildie.

Since these quests can generally only be done once, it's not like there's
some HUGE market out there of people "farming" quests to make quick cash.

Another overkill move.
