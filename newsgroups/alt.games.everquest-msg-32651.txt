>> Which Server is good so far? <<

Each server should have thier own website, since you mention Prexus I assume
you know about www.prexus.com
If it does, it should have a list of guilds, and most guilds have thier own
site (like my guild, www.infinitusvindicat.com )
As for newbies, they are pretty much a necessary evil, don't think you'll
ever escape those.

>>And 1 more thing, I can't find any marchants selling Bread on Qeynos and
Halas. <<

Bread is pretty much non existent on the Continent of Antonica because of
the plaque in the Fields of Karanas. I've been visiting Kunark, and I know
the merchants of Firiona Vie sell bread. Since that's a ways away from you,
you might try hopping the boat to Odus, and seeing if the merchants of
Erudin have any bread.
