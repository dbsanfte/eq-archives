call me stupid.
the program runs, and I can view the maps, but I can't seem to get the
Tracking working.
I have a setup like this:
computer (winXP) running EQ logging to eqlog_XXXX_85.txt
client computer (win2000) running mapx. Tracking:
\\computername\Everquest\eqlog_XXXX_85.txt with player name XXXX

when I do /loc in EQ, no X's appear in MapX.

what am I doing wrong here?
