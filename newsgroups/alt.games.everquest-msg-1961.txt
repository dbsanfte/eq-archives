i do not see whats wrong with twinking.  Unless people buy pp/items from ebay,
then thats pretty screwed up.  But take me for instance, my level 54 warrior
worked hard earning all the stuff on it and the extra items i cant use, why
should i be able to sell those items and use like 5kpp to make a char or 10kpp?
I remember it being a little frustrating at low levels seeing people all decked
out, but the truth is you will be able to do the same when u have a high level
char so dont worry about it.
