By dumping it all on one place on the ground. =)

Good zone. Silk is better in Inny I think. Skellies are par. Your right 
about bears & wolves. Now that we have PoK transportation to and from is 
easy (previously it was a hellish place to get to and to be for newbie 
Evil types). Doesn't have a bank, but it it does have a couple 
good-aligned merchants.

The hell it ain't :) Kurns is a great adventure zone. Wimping out and 
staying at the door will cause you to miss out on a great zone. Get your 
collective butts down to the basement. =)

Warrens is even better as there are multiple 'boss' mobs to take. From 
the Prince, to the King (if you can find a time when some twit passing 
through to stonebrunt hasn't knocked him over) to the Mugglewump...

That's half the fun. And if you dont group with newbies when they are 
new you'll just have to teach them all that when you bump into them in 
their 40s fresh out of the 
PC/OT/LDoN-collects-only-please-and-even-then-only-if-the-holy-trinity-is-along 
mill. =)

Its fun zone with a fabulous xp mod & lots to do; I rather do warrens 
then crushbone or blackburrow. And the Paineel/Erudin faction (mostly 
the paineel faction) can come in handy later too.
