/Agree.

Being Irish, I favour (!) non-US spelling as that is what I learned in
school, but given that Noah Webster "standardised" US spelling over 200
years ago, US spellings are just as correct as the British ones.  They are
more logical in fact as color and center sound closer to the spoken words
than colour and centre.  That said, however, I will continue to use the
spellings I grew up with!!

Wasn't it Winston Churchill who once said of the USA and Britain as being
"two countries separated by a common language"?
