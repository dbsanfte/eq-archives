    Lenny Now Level 52 and have noted that all my weapon skill are
maxing out at 206 that is 1 and 2 handed slashing  1 and 2 hand Blunt
allso Piercing 206 the max skill level is (as per Caster Realm) 225 
so lenny only get 3 ups per level?

allso the only one higher is Double Attack stuck at 208 so maybe 4 per
level because the max is listed (allso caster Realm) 235

so after level 50 cap the skill go up slower???

allso after 200 the skill should be called Grand Master
