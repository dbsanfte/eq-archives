Many thanks to *all* that answered with their tips, particularly to jaZZ who
made me smile (LOL) I particularly like the idea of setting up HotKeys to
take me to certain pages within my book. I'm off to try this right now. This
will be particularly useful for all those port spells I have to find in a
hurry, ports, gates, evacs an TL can be a pain in the proverbial to find
when in a hurry.

Safe hunting to all of you ...

Stevie.
