Ph34r that Kid, James.  We had a little bard join our guild on a Gorge 
raid many eons ago.  This was a learning raid - we were there to get 
used to working with each other, and to farm some supplies for our 
jewelers and potters.  Having already gotten my hands on a rallic pack, 
ee bag, dusty burlap sack, and lionskin bag, I was designated ML.

Not a half hour into the raid this bard starts whining that he's not 
getting exp, and there's no good loot for everybody here, and what are 
we doing here, let's go somewhere where we can get exp.  ha ha - these 
'cyans' were wiping the walls with us - people were all over the place, 
running out of heal range, aggroing shit they shouldn't, hitting shit 
I'd just announced as having mezzed (I feel thy pain, chanters), etc etc 
etc.  I was having a hard time too - I learned the hard way that a) the 
eyes charm and b) pets are a VERY bad idea when your target charms ;p  
And I kept trying to mez my PET, too, with everybody hitting it and 
insisting on taking the trouble to kill the dumb thing instead of just 
leaving it and killing the mezzing eyeball.

*twitch*

Sorry, still bad memories ;p

Anyway, he nagged and nagged wanting a gate from the raid, and 
eventually the thing just broke up because it was so messy.  I would 
have liked to have booted him from the guild right then and there too.  
But I didn't say anything - I was still fairly new myself.  So this bard 
stayed in our guild.  A LONG time.  And he kept causing problems.  I 
started a group in OT once, and he and his 'wife' (don't get me started 
;p) decided they wanted to join.  This was pre-pop, and they didn't want 
to take a boat, so they decided to get a port to... well, I'll give you 
one guess as to which dragon-infested zone they decided was the best 
place to land.  Naturally, they both died upon arrival and spent the 
time they waited for the poor porter to get them a rez bitching and 
whining in guild chat.  When they finally got their rezzes, they 
insisted that a group member had to come get them, although I mentioned 
multiple times that if they turned right and stuck to the wall, they'd 
run right into us.  *groan*  By that time I was so afraid to actually 
*group* with them, I made a hasty excuse and camped before they got 
there :p

There are many other stories, but basically, this guy's attitude was 
never successfully curbed, and he grew up into an arrogant, preening, 
strutting, whinging exuse for an EQ player - someone that literally 
drove several members out of the guild before FINALLY, the day the guild 
tool came out with LoY, and thanks to a new GL, I got permission to 
remove him and all his alts from the guild.  Sadly, it's far, far too 
late - the people who left because of him are happily involved in new 
guilds, and thanks to a very lax invite policy, he's not the only 
problem member anymore.

Annnnnnnnnyway.

Long story short: bitchslap that attitude of his into non-existance 
before it's too late.
