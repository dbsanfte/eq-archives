according to the eqw site, this is coming soon, but not yet.

i started using eqw when i went on a business trip and just had my
laptop with me (usually i play eq on my desktop and have my laptop
next to me for checking email, chatting, etc).  now i use it on my
desktop machine as well.  it's not so much that i do other things with
that machine while playing eq (although i will stick my bazaar mule in
a window and minimize it so i can do other things with my laptop), but
i am one of those fat fingered people who hits the start button.  a
lot.  my first group in KC on my 41 enchanter (yes, a bit low for that
zone), i get into UB, start handing out clarity and haste, and hit the
start button.  instant poof to desktop.

besides, eq takes up so much memory and cpu you really can't do
anything else while it's running anyway (unless you turn off ALL
features and constantly stare at the ground, like i do with my laptop.
it's amazing how i can identify friends by their old-model footwear
now ;).
