In his defense, he did not say that.  he said that there are 20 clerics in
the guild, but not many happen to be on at the time.

So, Hughes, what you are saying is that you take complete idiots along on
your raids who go AFK without telling anyone, or, if not AFK, they just
don't pay attention to what is going on during a fight?  And, given that
situation, it would really be great to have a bunch more people who can CH,
in the off chance that maybe that way there will be enough people who are
attending the raid that are maybe paying attention to what is going on, so
that the MA and his backups are not killed?

I am in a very far from uber guild, with not enough clerics to do a CHeal
rotation, and I know that I would get my ass chewed up one side and down the
other if I attended a raid, and was not paying attention, and not informing
anyone when I was going AFK.
