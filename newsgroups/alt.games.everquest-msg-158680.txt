At L7 it's gonna be hard to get lotsa money just killin yar trash.  Head to
Gfay and harvest bats wings (some higher PC's like me will pay 5-10p a stack
for them), bones chips (about the same price), and High Quality Pelts (5-25p
ea.) to name a few.

Also places like Gfay you can kill orcs that sometimes drop belts that other
players will buy for 1-5p each, so that adds up fast too.  You can also turn
in the belts in Kaladim for item+xp+money, that adds up very quickly.  The
bone chips too can be turned in at Kaladim for item+xp+money.

I took my L9 beastlord to L15 in Gfay doing those things and had 150p to
spare after getting some inital leather armor.

In the long term, you need to kill lotsa mobs that drops 3-6p each or have
bronze/Fine steel weps that sell from 1-5p each.  Eventually you'll make
300p in a few hours work, but not till after L30 or so.

Mobs that have rare drops offer instant cash, but camping them can be
daunting, and not a guarantee item for you.

Good luck, you'll get there, but it seldom comes all at once.
