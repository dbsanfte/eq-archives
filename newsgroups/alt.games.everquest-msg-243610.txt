Hehe!

My Halfling Ranger died as a result of the Bogus Spell Hit.

I was fear kiting in Stonebrunt. The Panda I was kiting recovered from 
the fear.

I think he was a tad upset as he turned around and clobbered me straight 
through the side of the cliff wall!

Next thing I know I am laying in the entrance tunnel to the Warrens 
unconscious :(

Then the you have been hit by a bogus spell message comes up and I am 
reloading back to PoK :(

At least my body was easy to get to :)

Add that to getting stuck in both the ramp out of the water to the 
lighthouse and from the jetty to the boat in Gunthak  while trying to 
outrun a train after my camouflage dropped trying to get to Dulak.

I died on both occasions to sticky scenery :(

Here's to hoping they can fix the bugs.

(Do I hear a squadron of pigs revving on the end of the runway <grin>)
