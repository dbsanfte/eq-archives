Oddly enough, the last adventure my rogue did, it was the wizard that really
made out.  He outrolled me for a fire resist augment, then was awarded an
intelligence augment.   After that two named died, one dropping caster
gloves, and the other dropping caster boots.    Although he most likely
spews the same bs you are, in this case he had no problem at all with NBG
being used, and happily pocketed both items.

In my last adventure that my warrior did, a 54 ac breastplate with 8 wis, 60
hp, etc, dropped.  There were three plate wearers in the group.  Two
warriors and a cleric.    All of us looked at it, and said "Damn, thats
really nice.  My twink / friend would love it, but I already have better."
It was randomed to the group, and the necromancer won it.

Both were 100% genuine pickup groups.
