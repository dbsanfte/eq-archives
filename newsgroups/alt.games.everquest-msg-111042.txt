I upgraded to an MSI Geforce 3 TI 200 Last December right after Luclin came
out and have been very pleased with its performance.  Stay away from the
Geforce 4 MX.  Nvidia dropped the ball on that one.  It is all based on
marketing strategies but the Geforce 4 MX is not a watered down Geforce 4.
It is of Geforce 2 quality.

Also if you are into overclocking you can download a registry hack call
Coolbits.  Go to google and do a search for Coolbits.  When you do the hack
it opens up and additional tab under your Geforce setup screen that allows
you to play around with the core clocks of both the GPU and video memory.
You can tweak the Geforce's core clock speed and memory clock speeds.  I got
my Geforce 3 TI 200 to run within 4 % of the Geforce 3 TI 500's speed and
the TI 200 cost me about 90 dollars less than the TI 500.  But be warned.
Overclocking your graphic chip and video memory needs to be done in small
increments.  If you go too high you can cause your system to crash or
possible damage your graphics card.
