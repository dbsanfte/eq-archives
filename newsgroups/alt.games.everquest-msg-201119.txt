Opps, looks like I ruffled your feathers. Sorry I was only really trying 
to say a couple of things that I don't think are too contraversial :

1) On the grand scale of things these Jerks did not seem that jerky to me
2) That your "outrage" and off hand rudeness could be see as just as 
jerky as the "Jerk's" behaviour.
3) I don't think that anyone actually broke any of the game rules (i.e. 
the PnP), but the person who came closest (by SoE's logic) was you, by 
almost claiming that you "owned" a camp. (I know that you didn't so to 
an extent this is moot)

By the PnP I mean that you can't own camps and that you should try to 
share. This is what both you and they did. When you realised that you 
were better off going somewhere else you went. I don't really see the 
problem.

That's because it is down to differences in opinion. I think that we 
even agree (loosly) about Kei and downtime, while dissagreeing on 
flaging or at least the analysis of it.

Not discredit, just to try and open your mind to the posibility that 
these guys were not really beening that jerky, and that you came accros 
in this post, a self proclaimed rant, as almost as jerky. While getting 
an ego massage from the NG once in a while after a bad experience can be 
good for the soul, it can also be good, if more chalanging, to question 
your initial aprasal of a situation.

But that's just it they *didnt*. At least not by the rules of the game.

I agree with what you say here, but from what you said it is not clear 
to me that they did just take the area off of you. When you asked if 
they were going to take the area from you none of them replied "Yes we 
are what the f*ck are you going to do about it!" they asked you to join 
their group (which you did). Now that sound like consent to me. If you 
had said to them. "I don't want to group with you because I can kill all 
these on my own and so I insist that we share spawns" and they had told 
you to bog off then I could understand the rant, but other than being a 
bit crude they did not seem *that* bad. Stupid sure. In the wrong place 
sure, but hell they weren't even that rude.

I really did not mean to pick on you Rumb, but there are so many of 
these "I met a bunch of idiots" posts here, and this one just seemed 
particularly undeserving of sympathy. I generally agree that the folks 
you met were being somewhat slow and were at least marginally rude, but 
I don't see a huge moral high ground for you to jump on and preach from. 
Iguess as others have said in the thread, if you don't like the smell 
then get out of PC :-P

Out of interest why did you choose to go there rather than oh anywhere 
else in the world ? (I know the zem, but is it worth it ?)

Sorry if you took everything I said as a personal attack, it wasn't ment 
to be that exactly, more of a slight wake up call. If you think that 
what happened to you is a reason to rant like that then you are 
definatly better off out of PC and you may want to look at why it made 
you so angry. (Self analysis can be fun :-)

Oh and there was suposed to be some humor in both my posts, I don't 
normally totally miss the mark, but I guess I could have this time.

Sorry again,

Jim
