The difference being, of course, that when the
Israelis kill civilians, it's by accident, or
as unavoidable collateral damage from going after
Palestinian terrorists/mortars/etc. which are
placed purposely among civilians.  And the
Israelis regret the deaths.

In contrast, when the Palestinians kill civilian
women and children, which is the vast majority
of who they kill, it's ON PURPOSE BECAUSE THAT'S
WHO THEY TARGET.  And the Palestinians dance in
the streets and pay the bomber's family reward
money.

So when some left-wing moron tries to claim some 
sort of moral equivalence between the two warring 
sides, as they all too often try to do, it makes
me want to puke.
