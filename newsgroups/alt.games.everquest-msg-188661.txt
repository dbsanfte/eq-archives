Can someone explain whether or not all mobs that con blue (for example) are
equal is experience to all other mobs that con blue. Or is it that blue mobs
range in levels from say 1-3 levels lower than your level and the only equal
XP is from mobs that are, say, all 2 levels lower?

I have read somewhere that spell caster mobs are of no greater value than
non casters. Of course I know that blue mobs in dungeons generally have a
modifier that outdoor mobs do not.
