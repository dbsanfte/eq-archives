It's not much better 

Pale Velium Cestus is 5/11 with a bonus of 13 in a 65 BL's hands
WLK is 16/22 with a bonus of 14 in a 65 BL's hands

((2*5)+13)/11 = ~2.1
((2*16)+14)/22 = ~2.1

The WLK has HP on it, the Cestus doesn't.

I have to admit, I found the idea of paying 15k (the asking price
on Lanys) for it to be absurd when WLK's go for as low as 8k (what
I payed)
