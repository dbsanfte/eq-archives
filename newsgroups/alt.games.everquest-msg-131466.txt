Ogguk, the Grobb, and Cabalis.
Of course you'll either have to do a -lot- of faction work
or get wolf form to train in the first two, and a metric
bardload of faction work to train in the third

Halas, on the other hand, is quite accessible nowadays, with
the druid port in Surefall Glade, not like the old days when
your barbarian shaman would have to cross ten zones, barefoot,
in the snow, uphill both ways to get to a trainer from freeport...
" and we Liked it that way!
