New pet with every new spell level ie. 9th, 15th, 22nd, 30th, 39th, 49th,
and I am not positive after that

As far as I can guess they are approx 4 levels below the level of the spell
that summons them, and yes they always summon the same level pet

From my experience playing the pet classes(mage/necro and now beastlord) the
pets do very well for dishing damage to the mob, they do however get smacked
around pretty good if they are your sole tank ... my 32 bstlrd with the 30th
lvl pet spell was taking tizmaks on with me casting the 300pt heal usually
only once, sometimes twice in a battle


Thanamar Level 42 Halfling Druid  - Vazaelle
Siril Level 32 Vah Shir Beastlord - E'Ci
Draxxle Level 16 Gnome Necromancer - E'Ci
Rustroot Level 52 Dwaarf Warrior - Vazaelle
