A guildie left EQ and I won the roll on all her equipment.  She gave it to me 
outside the big bank in pok.  I didnt' have enough open slots and a lot of it 
fell to the ground.  I frantically searched for empty bags on me that I could 
destroy so I could pick up the new bags with all her items in them.  I think I 
got it all but I'll never really know if somebody snagged something.
