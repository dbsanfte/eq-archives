Yes, to be sure.  You are thinking of EQ as a role playing game, which
it is only to a limited extent, unless you inject roleplay in yourself.

I'm thinking of it as a tactical/strategic game.  Consider chess.  Is
it a role playing game?  I suppose if you try real hard you can
picture a powerful queen, a week but vital king, two bishops (two?)
two knights, two (what, you are role playing moving castles now?)
and eight peons... but thats all on you, and has little to do with the
game.  On the other hand, you have an intensely strategic game
that takes a strictly limited number of pieces and variables and
turns them into a complex and challenging contest.

Everquest may revolve principly around killing stuff... but who
you are, what you can do, what sort of mob they are, what
they can do, how they react, all varies a great deal.  Add
one to five friends with up to five other classes into the mix,
and you come up with -far- more strategic options than
chess.  Then consider that six is not the functional limit, heck,
I've been in battles involving sixty players in a raid... although
oddly at this level the strategy and your involvement in it is
probably much less complex than it was when you were in a
group of four.

This is certainly not true.  How about talking to people, convincing them
you are trustworthy, and getting funding from them?  As a gift (you
begger scum) or more interestingly as an investment.

Additionally, you can go into business as a broker: few and far between,
these people sell the loot of others in exchange for a commission, and
perhaps also -buy- items for them, again for a cut of some kind (say
for example whatever is left over from this 3000pp after you buy that
item I want.

There are numerous quests, particularly at lower levels, which will
give you experience without you ever killing a thing.  True, if you
exp up that way your combat skills will suck eggs... but if you never
intend to fight anything, who cares?

Yes, 99% of the games players will do nothing but kill stuff and
get loot.  I put it to you, though, that even if you follow the same
trend, there can be more to it than:

walk up to mob
hit auto attack
wait till it dies
sit till you feel better
repeat.

In fact, even this plan is hard to pull off, since there aren't many
mobs that will stand there fighting until dead... and there are
wanderers that will likely attack you in the middle of that
static fight if you try this.

If you lump all strategic and tactical play into the "kill stuff"
box, then yes, I think you are correct, its difficult (not impossible)
to play a the game without concentrating principly on
that one thing.
