Double-check the name that the quest-giving NPC says to hand the
item to.  And double-check the name at the top of the "trade" window
after you've shoved the item at the quest-receiving NPC, but before
you hit "Give".  Sometimes it's easy to initiate a trade with the
wrong NPC if there's another one standing nearby.

Also, Consider (target and press "c") the recipient NPC, and
make sure they consider you with some good degree of friendliness.
Each quest has a minimum "faction" rating that you need with them
before they'll do "business" with you.  You might have to work up
your faction rating with Bards before you can complete the mail
quests with them, but that's most likely not the problem here, they
should like you enough already.

You're not supposed to hit the "attack/melee" button, you're supposed to
hit the "autoattack" button, which by default is "a".  Once you do,
you'll attack repeatedly automatically until the creature dies or you
turn it back off (with "a" again).  Note:  Having the "a" key as autoattack
is a BAD idea, as you'll discover the first time you try to talk to
an NPC and forget to hit "return" first to bring up the chat prompt --
the first time you hit an "a" in your intended message, you'll
autoattack the NPC and get your head knocked off in return.

Go to Options/Keyboard and remap the Autoattack function to some
other, non-alphabetic key.

You'll know that you've successfully engaged autoattack when the
box around your "bar box" (the one that contains your name, your
HP bar, your mana bar, and your energy bar) begins to flicker red
(and if you have your speakers turned up, you'll hear the battle
music).

You'll get 5 more practice points every time you level, for the
life of your character.  Most things go up fast enough through general
use, although keep this in mind:

   1.  Some skills won't even be available to you until you put
       at least one practice point into them once you've reached
       (or exceeded) the minimum level for that skill.

   2.  Some skills will be usable but won't go up AT ALL unless
       you've put at least one practice point into them.

So it's often a good idea to scrupulously put one practice point
into each skill you have or have just gotten, unless you're certain
it's already going up on its own.

Other than that, the best use for practice points is to apply them
to a tradeskill you're starting.  You can put up to 20 practice
points into a given tradeskill before the trainer will tell you
that you can only advance further through actual practice.  The
reason this is a good idea is that doing 20 points of advancement
via practice points is a hell of a lot cheaper (and faster) than
buying enough components to actually exercise your tradeskill
up 20 points.
