i bought the g4mx440 as a stop gap until the geforcefx card comes out,
orignaly had a geforce2mx400 i got for christmas. compared to the
geforce2mx it is a way better card, so i cant complain. And it still
is a great card. Plays all my games 100%.. Remember not everybody can
go out and spend a couple hundred dollars for a video card.
