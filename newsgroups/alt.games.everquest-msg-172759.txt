Well, I did pick OS/2, but, due to a relative lack of hardware support for
most of my peripherals at the time, I had to revert to Windows.  I never got
to choose between Beta and VHS.  Never tried any keyboard other than QWERTY
on which I learned to touch type, and don't feel like learning all over
again.  Country vs Hip Hop, um, well, er, silence would be far perferable to
either one.
