The enchanter class is what a call a "passive-aggressive" class.  They cannot
hurt the monster (well, not very efficiently) but can enable another person to
do so.  In addition there are the crowd control skills that are essential in a
group that is pulling multiple monsters (this is very useful but lacks the
dramatic effect of just blowing the fucking thing apart).

Once I realized the passive nature of the enchanter I also became a bit
frustrated too.  I ended up playing a druid once in a while do I could
alternate between being passive-aggressive and just goddamn aggressive and
foudn that once again I was enjoying the enchanter.  If you are the type to
play just one character then the enchanter may not be for you.

I like jewellry making just because I can make useful gear for my guildmates,
I'm not in it to beat the Robbins Brothers at selling engagement rings.  It's
also useful for twinking.
