Yeah, but the odds of that happening are quite slim when you have an
uncommon account name and password.

If your son's info is like:

drizzit 

and password

drizzit99 (I'm sure some people are this stupid)

and the guys info is

drizit

and password

drizzit99 

You could certainly see how that could happen. Any 2 people can have
the same password and a very similar loggin name. That is why you
should choose a loggin name unlikely to resemble anything other people
have. Something resembling a fictional character's name or anything
out of a dictionary is a very bad risk. Similarly as with secure
passwords and loggins on any computer systems the password should
contain letters and numbers in a sequence only familar to you and the
letters should form a nonsensical word, rather than just a word
spelled backwards.

borguzmy

and

feiniz35670932

would be examples of a good loggin and password. 
I hope I did not get borguzmy's password right!!!

This is also why quite some time ago when your eq ACCOUNT name was
showing up on the EQ message board people were freaking out, that gave
anyone who wanted to try half of the equation to accessing your
account.

Unfortunately I don't think after the fact you can change your account
name to something more difficult... so its best to pad the password.
