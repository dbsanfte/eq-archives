I wasn't really arguing anything.  I was just contradicting the comment that
since the ban on handguns, the overall crime rate in the UK has risen:

I never said that  the decrease was *due* to banning guns.  I said that
since ban on hand guns in 1997 the crime rate has fallen but I'm the first
one to admit that there could be many more explanations for it.  I was
mainly talking about statistics and not the effectiveness of government
policy.
