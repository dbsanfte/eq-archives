Have not taken ALTs on any major raids yet, one is 51 (monk) other is
58 (sk), but 5% sounds more like it. Not sure about AE's. Tends to be
more on Snares, and DD's so far (Ldon adventures). Actually have worn
it on a weapon my druid uses (the one that processes that 320 dd - Orb
of Forgetful Magic?), but have never had Mirror I work in places like
Droga where he tends to use it from time to time (when not main
healer) and most casters there are AE's.
