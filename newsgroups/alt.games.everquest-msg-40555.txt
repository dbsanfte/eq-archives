Well, basically adds up the same either way. I've never played a
stun-capable class, but the paladins I've spoken to use it as a primary
method of emergency taunting, so I had assumed the taunt value was rather
severe.

Try  a monk with a tranq staff...friend of mine is a 60 monk, and just with
epic fists, she is effortlessly able to taunt Ragefire, Gorenaire, etc, etc
off multiple 60 warriors.

It is, but self-only...but had forgotten about that in the healing
category. Bandages are downtime healing exclusively, so don't really fall
into this category, hence the low rating. Mend would bring it up to 4 I
think, due to the fairly rapid re-use time (compared to say, harm touch and
lay hands). So noted :)

Bear in mind that this is a level 60 rating. LDCs remain blue through 60,
but not much else is blue that is doable by a monk without tremendous
downtime, or a fungi. And monks generally need a big hitting 2HB (the tranq
staff is ideal, barring something really outrageous, like the bo staff of
trorsmang) to avoid being riposted to death.

60 rogues sneak at full running speed, or at worst only slightly reduced.
Not a drawback.

But unless they are epic, the instrument requirement of the invis song
limits their selos ability, plus they'd have to twist, which can get
aggravating on long trips. Bards may not get an IVU song, I'm not certain.

But invis is seen through in too many zones for it to be reliable.

I also recall now a screenshot of some bard having a divine aura type
spell/discipline...maybe this needs a raise to 6.

Songs have puny range compared to most pulling spells/bows. Bard HP is
gimpy for taking the back-to-camp hits, and they are far better served
staying at camp, even before they get a mana song...heal song can do
wonders during a pulling lull.

In balanced groups too.
