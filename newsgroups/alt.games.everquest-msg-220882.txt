    Can I ask you a personal question?

    Why did you make a warrior?

    I'd vote running that one on test and seeing how it looks. Something's
gotta be done, if only so we can stop reading about THE most boring class in
the game.

    I think you may be slightly overestimating the power of Knight agro...
holding agro off of casters is still a full time job for me. It's not like I
magically click a button and agro is held permanently. I have a particular
amount of agro I build up for each fight and that amount varies greatly
depending on who's casting what. And I do vary it, because holding agro
costs mana like you wouldn't believe - and so do my 60's spells because most
of them are directly imported from a class that can regen 50 mana/tick. If I
have to feign pull a complicated pair of spawns (say two wanderers or even
two statics that PERSISTENTLY re-add) I need to save up to a third of my
mana bar for recasts of snare and feign. I think this situation's added a
whole new dimension to the game - and what has it really removed?

James
