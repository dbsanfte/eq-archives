}Got full version window 98 SE CD (neglected to get the start up disk
}though). Had to update to win 98 due to having to use Directx 8.1 and win 95
}not able to use it. The 98 Cd goes through its system check prepares to
}install accesses the A: then error which reads like " you already have a
}operating system installed this version of setup cant upgrade it you need
}the win 98 upgrade cd".Tried all the suggestions in the readme file in the
}win 98 dir on the cd all in vain tried reinstall win95 nothing any
}suggestions or anyone else had this problem. I would appreciate any help in
}this manner as iwould really like to get playing on Everquest. also any
}suggestions for a good server no pvp from Australia lag etc would also be
}good. Seeya on Everquest in the future when this is finally sorted you think
}microsoft might one day make something that works, na not bloody likely
}mate.

You can fool the computer into thinking the old operating system is gone 
by deleting one crucial file in your windows directory.  I think it's 
explorer.exe, but I usually just nuke the whole directory.  It's a serious 
kludge, but it does work once in a while.

You know you've been plqying this game too long, though, when you look at 
that subject and try to figure out if 'SOS' Means 'Spirit of Scale' or 
'Speed of the Shissar'...
