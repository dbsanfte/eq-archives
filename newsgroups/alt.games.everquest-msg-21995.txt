Not screwed entirely.  A friend of mine recently bought a high level
character and made the mistake of turning in the book.  All you have to do
is Petition and a GM will give you a quest which if you complete, he will
remove your redness.  His quest wasn't very hard, he just had to travel from
one corner of norrath to the other and collect a few uncommon items
including a fine plate BP, a rare fish from OOT, and some other crap.  We
did it in an afternoon.
