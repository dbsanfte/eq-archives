If I recall correctly, you have to train it at least one point before it
will go up on its own. After that, it raises pretty quickly if you hit
whenever it refreshes.

For some skills, yes, it does work somewhat similarly. You will not get
combat skill-ups against targets that are low green cons (con ==
consider, target something and hit 'c' and note the color of the text)
to you. For tradeskills, certain recipes have a skill level at which
they go "trivial" and stop raising your skill if you make them, so you
need to work on harder recipes. Spell-casting skills, however, can be
raised just by casting a spell of the appropriate skill class over and
over, and any spell will do, even your lowest level ones.
