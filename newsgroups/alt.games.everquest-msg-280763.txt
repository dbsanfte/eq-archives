There is really nothing they could do to make me come back to EQ2 at this 
point.  Even if they decided to shut down EQ1, I'd just go try WoW or CoH 
for a while rather than go back to EQ2.  It does sound like they are 
making the right type of changes to alleviate many of the issues I had 
with EQ2, but, given their track history, I just don't want to get 
seriously involved in another SoE game.
