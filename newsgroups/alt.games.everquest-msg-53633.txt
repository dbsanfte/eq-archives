If you are over 18, you have no business in this game!  I played EQ for over
a year and watched other aspects of my life slowly deteriorate.  If you
think you can handle real life and EQ, well my apologies, this post is not
for you.  But I have a feeling that most of you do not fall into that group.

I posit a question to the single men playing this game - when is the last
time you got laid?

Give it up now and save your life.  Remember what your character is worth -
a bunch of electronic bits on Verant's server.  There is no permanency
there.  What will you have to show for all your efforts when the game is
done?  No one in the real world is impressed with your level 60 druid.

Besides, the gameplay is boring.  All I did was sit on my ass meditating for
75% of the time.

And if you do continue to play, at least have the decency to play on Rallos
Zek.  At least there is a goal there besides leveling.
