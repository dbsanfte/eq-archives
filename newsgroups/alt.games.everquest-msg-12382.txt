Well, first I'd come up with the unifying theme, or structure, of your
guild. I mean, your guild has to have a reason to be together, right?
Go with it. I always find that guilds that are purely social clubs,
that have no real defining reason to be together other than BEING
together, are rather dull - I love a guild with history, and purpose.

I mean, if you are forming a guild just for a social purpose then you
may as well call it the Buena Vista Social Club.

So, quick review of the names from my PoV:

Nightmare Runes - what about them? While its definitely an 'evil'
sounding name, whats the purpose? Are you hunting the Nightmare Runes?
Protecting them? Seeking them? What are the Nightmare Runes? And why
are they so important? Possible alternatives: Hunters of the Nightmare
Runes, Desecrators of the Nightmare Runes, Nightmare Rune Followers...

Spirits of the Forest - as others have mentioned, this definitely
gives off a Druid/Ranger 'vibe'. I'd expect the guild to have some
story along those lines - a band dedicated to Karana, perhaps.
Possible alternatives: Forest Children, Spirit Children, Karana's
Chosen, Followers of the Green

Dragon Walkers - again, as others have mentioned Dragon is used way
too much, so Id stay away from it on those grounds - youre guild
wouldnt be very unique at all. That aside, it does give off a
Veeshan-worshipping feel, but as I recall - only bards can worship
Veeshan. So, maybe a band of Veeshan-worshipping bards? Possible
alternatives: Veeshans Chosen, Children of the Wyrm, Cult of Veeshan,
Order of Draco

And just a few possible other names that have popped into my head
while writing this:

Black Sun
Shadow Court
Band of the Red Hand
Order of the Crux Ascendant
Cult of the Serpent
Brotherhood of the Rose

And my personal favourite:
Playable Froglok Race Now! (okay, that ones a joke - but has anyone
used the guild tag as a form of advertisement yet?)

I'd like to see where you go from here - keep us informed!
Mike
