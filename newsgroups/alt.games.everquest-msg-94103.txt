You have to admit though, that most of the time that's a good starting
assumption.

More than once when I've been forced to deal with CS myself, I've
opened with "I did CS for nine years, so I know your routine. I'm a
computer expert, and I don't need to be led by the nose through such
complex tasks as clicking the Start button, so let's cut to the chase.
Here's the problem..."

I've been gratified to see that even though the level 1 support monkey
may not understand me when I say that, it often does derail them from
their flash cards enough to make the phone call productive.
