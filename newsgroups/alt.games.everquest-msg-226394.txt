How many people bought LDoN primarily to get the keychain, but who had 
no interest in even trying LDoN?? Anyone?

Its a pretty absurd scenario. And no  although the keychain promo, and 
even the EQ2 beta promo are 'tying' they aren't illegal. Hell they 
aren't even 'distasteful' unless customers are feeling ripped off... 
which in the case of being obligated to buy LoE to ensure you get into 
the EQ2 beta they do. I'm sure if someone bought LDoN for the keychain 
and just the keychain they probably feel ripped off too... but really... 
was their anybody??

Tying is illegal because it undermines competition. A good real-world 
example of tying is some of the telecommunications bundles that are 
starting to show up, "requiring"/"allowing" you to get broadband, 
telephone, and TV all from one provider.

If the local landline telco starts offering ipTV (which they are already 
doing in some markets) should they be allowed to demand you subscribe to 
their ipTV (television) service in order to receive telephone service?? 
Note that you don't NEED telephone service anymore, you could get a cell 
from any of a number of carriers, or use VoIP...
