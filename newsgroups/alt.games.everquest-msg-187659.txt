All my groups use it regularly.... infact if the group leader does not
have LoY, I request to be leader for that reason alone. (I mainly
group with friends lately so this request isnt a usurping of
leadership).
My biggest gripe is... I turn on LFP, and the get match button is
greyed out sometimes.... and if I do a / all LFG  there are beaucoup
matches for what I have selected.  then 10 min later the button is
ungreyed, and get several matches...    this problem so far with me
has been inconsistant.
