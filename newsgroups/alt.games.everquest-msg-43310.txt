TLC has not affected me one way or the other.  I didn't care when it was
implemented, and I don't care if it goes into SoL or not.  I don't have the
patience to camp something for any length of time anyway, so if some farmer
wants too, have at it.  I play to have fun, sitting at a hours or days long
spawn is not fun.  The only thing I have camped in the game so far, is the
guy in HHP for my Testament of Vanear.  That camp lasted for about 30
minutes, then I got bored, and went off and had fun.  I don't know what I'm
going to do about Jboots for my warrior, at least that's a 6 minute spawn,
so lots to kill while waiting on the AC.
