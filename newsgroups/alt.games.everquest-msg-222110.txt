Race matters very little in terms of job description.  Given two otherwise
identicle warriors you might want an ogre to MT since he can't be stunned by
mobs in front of him.  Other than that I can't think of any reason to prefer one
race over another for any job.

MT and MA are almost always the same person.

MT is Main Tank, the person who is supposed to be the punching bag the mob uses.

MA is Main Assist, the person who designates which mob the group is going to
kill next.  Since you often see more than one mob with the same name, using the
/assist command means you can all pick the same mob, while having someone just
name the target in group can get you messed up.

Normally, the MT picks the next target, may even taunt it awhile before starting
the kill, and sometimes (more often on raids) will be the only person engaged
with it for a while until he calls for the rest to join in.  So he's ideal for
MA in most circumstances.  So much so that we normally use the term MA to cover
both MA and MT

I have seen groups where MA was an enchanter, who knew the order in which mobs
had been mezzed, and which ones had had their mana removed or been crippled or
so forth, he'd get the correct next target selected shortly before the current
one died, and everyone would assist off of him.  Even then, there'd usually be a
MT who everone else could just as well assist as assisting the chanter directly.

===========================
Puller.
Monk: has FD to split mobs with, and tends to have the most experience pulling,
and has Mend for bad situations.  Down side: no snare, low HP and poor
mitigation, throw range only
SK: also has FD, has snare, has real AC and HP, has invis for scouting, archery
range pulling.  Down sides: FD is cast so interrupts are possible, tend to be
less experienced
Rogue: Sneak/hide can be used for scouting, and for stunt pulling past mobs that
would otherwise aggro, archery range.  Poor hp and AC, no FD
Ranger: Track, invis, archery range, harmony, snare; poor HP and AC and no FD in
case things go wrong
Druid: Track, invis, snare
