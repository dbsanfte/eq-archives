In a month, this "scare" will be forgotten.  The media has to find ways to
keep giving this story steam.  It's been three weeks since the tragedy, and
the stuff they've said so far has just been repetition after repetition
after repetition.  So they figure, with the information on the crop dusters,
they can run with this biochemical story for another few weeks.

In the end, the terrorists, I think, wanted to achieve three objectives:

1.  To put the US' and the World's financial markets into a tailspin.
2.  To create hysteria in the US and possibly worldwide.
3.  To get some PR.

The media has gratefully achieved two of these objectives for the
terrorists.

I mean, really, there's a limit to all this scaremongering.  Like war
itself, where it's not the war but the cleaning up afterwards that is the
real challenge, so here.  Dealing with the terrorist attack itself, though
certainly difficult to deal with psychologically, is not the toughest part.
It's our reaction to it.  Are we to just freak out and go too far in
protecting ourselves or can we do what is justly and wholeheartedly needed?
So far, it seems we've reacted too extremely as a society; and, at least so
far, too little militarily.
