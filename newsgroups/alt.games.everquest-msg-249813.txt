There are LDoN augs with this ability.
There is a reasonable Bard Singing Steel item with this ability if your 
a bard.

There is a quest for an EB item in the grey that is quite easy (one or 
two days tops) provided you've got a group of mid-high 40s, or are 
higher level.

There are lesser EB items with clickable EB instead of permanent, that 
tend to for less. (some of these have charges and go for even less). 
There are a number of EB item drops in Siren's Grotto iirc.

There are summoned mage stones that grant click-EB that can be had for 
next to nothing. (non lore)

You can use tribute to get permanent EB if your in a bind too.
