Wow, you went the long way. Next time, get a 34+ to port you to Twilight
Sea, then do a lessor succor. This will bring you right to the gates of
Katta Castellum. As soon as you zone in, if the wizard does another lessor
succor, it will bring you right to the second floor near the castle where
most spells are sold. He/She can then port you back to the Nexus.

Piece of cake for most guilds. I would do it anytime for my guild (or for
anyone else that asks me--if I'm not busy doing something else.)

Incidentally, the killing of the 45+ was by a necromancer--it's called a
sacrifice. In other words, that 45+ gave the experience he lost to you.
(That boggles my mind.)

Katta is fine for a half-elf bard, but don't practice any area-effect
spells. Casting even beneficial spells on an NPC causes them to aggro you
(i.e., kill you).
