Hi All,

Have no problem going through DL (invis potions for now and I have
SOW) to the Wizzy Spires and porting to Nexus, then going through
Bazaar to Shadow Haven, where I am viewed as apprehensive, but can't
train with the Beastlord trainer there, which I think at level 39
would be convenient since I'll be in DL after then. I am currently
level 37, so where should I go to get this up? I do not have a great
knowledge of the area, but have printed some maps that help. Also I
have been looking there and in East Cabilis for the level 39 spell
Summon Companion, is this spell any good? I know I would us it as I
usually park my pet when I zone and run through to where I need to go
(usually the other side --like FM). I like that it costs us nothing to
resummon a pet, but the buffs eat a lot of mana. Thanks.

Geckool 37th Season Iksar Beastlord (Quellious).
