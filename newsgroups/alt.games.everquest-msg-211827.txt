As a shaman, the answer is to have the pet guard a spot, arrange things so that he
meets mobs ahead of that spot, and bring any adds back to third spot thats on the
way to his guard spot.. and keep the pet sowed.  Without SOW, pets have a hard
time making it out of attack range from the original target no matter how you
monkey around with their guard spot and fight spots.

I have moderate amounts of luck with my mage running in past the pet and original
mob, "scraping off" the mob onto my pet.  Pet doesn't change targets with this
approach, but if I haven't done anything to get the target mad at me other than be
there or attack his buddy, the fact that my pet is attacking his buddy and is
closer to him than I am seems to do the trick.

Worst case for me is when I pull a mob, an add comes along for the ride, hits me
on the way in, and my pet gets on the add.  Now the mob I originally pulled is
madder at me than the "well he hit my buddy" level of anger, and scraping him off
is much harder.

Experience with a druid, shaman, and bard tells me that the secret to my woes
would probably be running faster than the mobs; with SOW or even JBoots, I could
happily kite adds till pet finishes off what he's working on, and often won't need
to because I'll be able to open up range  long enough that prox aggro will have a
much better chance of working.

At any rate, I too would like to see more on mage approaches to this problem

Splendid
