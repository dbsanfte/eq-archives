You forgot to multiply that by 420000 Everquest subscribers.

So assuming people can't play for 3 days:

[(12.95/31) * 3] * 420000 = $526354.83 VI has charged customers for a 
service they are not providing due to this patch.

Nice money if you can get it.

However, I doubt EQ will be unavailable for 3 days.
