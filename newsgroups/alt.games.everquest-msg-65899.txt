I went to the official web site, and about 3/4ths of the servers are
listed as up... but when I try to log in, I get "server congested" for
ten minutes straight.

Of course this is my old perineal favorite gripe; is that message
telling me the truth, or are the servers actually locked?

Back when we got numbers, instead of "UP, DOWN, or LOCKED" it was easy
to tell when a server wasn't really up, there were only a couple GMs in
there.  Now, though... well they -have- the capability to say "LOCKED"
why don't they use it?
