This point is often debated over at the enchanter boards.  About half
the people think the spell is crap, the other half think it's the best
spell we get.  

Me?  I only un-mem this spell in ToV and Kael.  At 70 mana a cast, I
can cast it all day long and not run out of mana.  In most XP groups I
don't need the long duration of dazzle becase the mobs die so quick.

 It's also my Hail Mary spell for when the tank comes back almost dead
with 5 mobs banging on him; either mez all mobs NOW or tank dies
situations.  


Anyhoo, try to always keep your MR around 150 or better.  Cast from a
distance when you can.  You can also target a corpse or another player
on the far side of your camp to get mobs in range but make sure you're
out of range.
