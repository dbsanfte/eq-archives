Good post. I live in Tornado Alley myself (have for 30ish years). I am used
to dealing with that threat every season, and to some extent it is simply
being prepared and having a plan of action and as you made good sense of,
going on with your life.

My post was to get people thinking as if something is imminent (as it is).
What would you do right now if you suddenly were faced with an event? Just
like what would you do right now if a Tornado is heading towards you?

A little planning goes a long way. Unlike tornados however, a large event
will tax the medical community, may gridlock, may cause quarantine, and
several other possible issues. Simply being a little smarter, and more
prepared while going about your daily routine is simply being one step ahead
as best you can.

Criminals robbed houses, people bought home alarms. Cars got robbed, we
bought car alarms. Now people blowing up large buildings, threatening more
serious events with legitimate ability to carry them out. Time to make some
plans and adjustments.

It certainly doesn't comfort me when a Russian official this last week talks
about how 80 of the Russian "suit case nukes" are missing, and he believes
that 1-2 are in the terror organizations hands already. Anything can happen
and the wildest things probably will sadly. Not time to freak out, just get
a grip and be prepared as best you can.
