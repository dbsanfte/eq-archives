}I just wanted to know if there's a resource that lists the keys and what
}they go to.  I guess i'll just write the keys down, and where i got them,
}and what they're for and hope i don't loose the paper.

Personally, I think a master known key list would be a wonderful idea.  At 
the moment, I'm keeping track of my complete set of ToFS keys by keeping 
them in the same order in the same backpack at all times...  But every 
once in a while I somehow pick up another key from somewhere and get it 
mixed in there, and it causes me 12 seconds' worry.  

We did a great job a while back putting together a list of all the game's 
containers, why can't we put together a list of keys and locked doors (and 
maybe, as a bonus, the level of lockpicking needed for the doors :) )
