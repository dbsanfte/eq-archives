If you look carefully at the map, you should see a lava tunnel that
leads to the castle that you can levitate and follow to get there. I did
this while getting my epic solo with my cleric and other than having to
beat up a couple of sonic bats that jumped me at the first bridge I
didn't have any trouble. It's a heck of a lot easier than fighting in.
Just don't miss the turn where the lava river heads south(-1050,-50),
it's a hairpin turn and easy to miss and go the wrong way on. If you go
the wrong way you drop down a falls and cant climb back up so you will
need to gate out and try again.

You can get off the lava at the area where it widens out to the south.
The ledge is not on the eqatlas map. Ragefire spawns where the bridge
crosses the lava north of room 17 right against the wall of the castle.
