Not to mention better augments.  For example, my enchanter is level 52.  In
dungeons where most members are lower than that, the augments give +4 to a
stat.  In dungeons where most are higher, they give +5.  Not a huge
difference, but along with more points and probably better (non-augment)
loot it can be a consideration.
