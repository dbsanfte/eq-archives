I think that's the scene where I fell in love with it. *grin*  That's one
thing Firefly is wonderful about...taking the annoying archetypal scenes
from other movies and ripping them apart.  Like the "two men in guns
facing off, one telling the other that he doesn't have the nerve to shoot"
scene from the pilot, and Malcom strolling in on them and
just...*pomph*...dead annoying man...without even breaking his stride.

"You think your better than other men."
"Only the ones I'm better than."
