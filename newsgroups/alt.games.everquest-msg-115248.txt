Well, since you're on Luclin...

You can get to Netherbian Lair pretty quick. That place is nice. If, for
some reason, you can't get a group there, go to Marus Seru, which is one
zone away. Nearly every Luclin zone I've tried so far (with the exception of
Shadeweaver, that place sucks) is great experience.
