Learning how to trust your group is a very important thing for a
wizard to learn.  You have to be willing to stand and take a severe
beating while your group tries to taunt the mob off of your pretty
little face.  Above all else, DO NOT RUN.  It makes it very hard to
taunt off of, and you'll most likely run out of the range of your
healers.  Trust your group, and your healer.  If you really think
you're in too much danger, root the creature and back up.  Root is
quick casting, and since it's so low level, you can channel it through
most hits.

My advice is to group as much as you can.  This will teach you
valuable skills in how to effectivly group... and a solo'ing a wizard,
while it can be done, is deathly boring.
