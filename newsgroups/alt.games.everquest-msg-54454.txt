That's good to note. I only just started a DE Cleric after deciding to 
avoid the almost ritualistic Dwarf or HE route. I've been worried how the 
race faction would hit me, but seeing your comments on faction raising

One thing tho...how do you ally with the guilds you mentioned? Is it some 
quest that needs to be done?
