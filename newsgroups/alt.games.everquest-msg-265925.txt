Definitely on the PC... the Mac doesn't have anywhere near enough 
horsepower, and I just blew a bunch of money (not to mention tearing my 
hands to ribbons) upgrading the CPU and mobo on the games machine. Man... 
if I ever mention upgrading my PC again, someone please shoot me. Once 
you have opened a Mac case, working on the insides of a PC is just *
wrong*.

By the way... I got a 3D Mark score of 1915 with my old CPU (Athlon XP 
2000) and of 2061 with my new one (Athlon 64 3200), with the same video 
card (Radeon 9800 Pro). The actual difference in gameplay seems to be 
much wider than the small difference in scores would suggest... I think 
that must be because 3DMark is not running at the native resolution of 
my LCD monitor, and I can't change that unless I buy the full version.

Hm... I'm not sure how a PowerBook G4 would handle WoW, even a 1.2 Ghz, 
particularly taking into account how stingy Apple are with their choice 
of video cards. It would be sweet on a dual 2.5 Ghz G5 PowerMac, though. :)

Do you know if Mac and Windows players will be able to access the same 
servers? That was the reason I never got Everquest for the Mac.
