Yeah, I'm sure you can. It'll be hard, but doable.

It's not.

The problem with going in the front door is the first pull past the gate,
right before you get to the ballroom...  even at level 45 you'll get about 6
or 8 on the pull.  The aggro is just funny that way.

All of the "ex-girlfriend" mobs that you see in there are undead.   You
might be able to get in, but it would take a good bit of luck.

I think we just went into the main ballroom ourselves, then sat in a corner
and worked on pulling the dance floor.   It's still a nasty break, but it
can be done. It was a long, long time ago that I did this though, so I dont
remember who all was with us at the time.
