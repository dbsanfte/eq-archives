I seem to remember being in a group a long time ago in Kael. We were camping
the Icehouse - which is fun in itself - and at some point, the GL
"triggered" some cycle, which caused giants to come in through the doors
behind the throne. When you killed one, another walked through the door,
etc.etc. And naturally, they kept getting stronger and stronger. I remember
this as being great fun!
So, since I'm desperately working to max out my CoV, and I figured this
cycle would be a nice way to help do that... can anyone tell me how to start
this cycle? What's it for? Or is it just fun?

Thanks,

Lalor
