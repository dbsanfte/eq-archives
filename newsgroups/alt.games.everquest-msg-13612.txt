Why? because I hate it when the under-educated spread mis-information to the
rest of the world, and then refuse to admit their mistakes when they are shown
how naive they really were? Yeah, I guess I do over-react to that, which is why

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abndance of laziness in the universe,
we we might all be dead."
