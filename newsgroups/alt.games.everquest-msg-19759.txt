Not only is that not possible, but I believe that you cannot use more than
one line in a social.  Really.  I've been told that even though you see all
the lines, no one else does.  I've never tested this.  Your message just
gave me an idea to try though.  I wonder if the file that stores the socials
could be edited to add newlines?
