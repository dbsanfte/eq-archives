Normal and AA exp are exactly the same stuff, if killing mob A gives you 
200 xp and you put it all into "real" you'll get 200 xp, if you put it 
all into AA you'll get 200 AA xp.

The thing is, the xp needed to move your real xp bar a certain 
percentage changes as you level up.

Say at level 51 it takes 200 xp to move your bar 2% at 100% real, it 
will also take 200 xp to move your AA bar 2% at 100% AA.

But at level 52 it may take 300 xp to move your real bar 2%.  That same 
150 xp will move your AA bar 3%, because the amount of xp needed to get 
an AA never changes.

If your only choice is between a camp of DB mobs at 52 and LB mobs at 
53, you'll get AA faster by staying 52; this is something that happens 
to a lot of people at the line between 62 and 63.  The reason for this 
is that the xp you get for killing a given mob drops each time you level 
up; that mob that was giving you 100xp now gives you 90... but when a 
mob turns LB there's a sharp drop, the DB mob that was giving you 100xp 
now gives you 50xp.  Can you kill them twice as fast just because you 
got one level?


However, I very much suspect that you'll find DB mobs you can slaughter 
at 53 if you just look around some more; the world is filled to the brim 
with mobs of all levels.
