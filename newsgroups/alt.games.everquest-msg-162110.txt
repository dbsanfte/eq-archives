sorry for the toppost.

When I think of a Ranger I think of a Bow-in-hand melee. To truly make the
Ranger what a Ranger needs to be, is to make the wielded melee more like
that of a Bard (bare with me) take away the double attacks on the wielded
melee and only allow it on bow shots. Make Bow an autoattack feature and
leave the bow dmg alone.
The problems that exists atm is...a warrior is just that (the heavy armor
gladiator type) the Bard is mostly a song player that should be handy with a
knife like a rogue.
Monk is a defensive warrior i.e. his dmg should come from the clumsy
miss-attack of his opponent (think of a karate expert you know the little
man who only inflicts dmg when the big clumsy guy tries to power punch him)
Paladin is a warrior with Holy Might he does not get any of the offensive
advantages but has some of the defensive ones
Shadow Knight is the Evil opposite of the Paladin but for all intensive
purposes same melee style
Rogue the Thief he usually is too scared to fight face to face and is
usually hiding in shadows till he gets the attack of opportunity backstab.

This is the way I see the major melee classes (if I left one out, I felt it
did not need addressing) and the ranger is just too close to the warrior on
the offensive melee, just where he should not be. A Ranger should be handy
with a blade but not nearly as they should be with a Bow. This would make
the class more fun to play the total dmg output would be more near where it
needs to be. A Ranger in a group should be able to stand back and protect
the casters while shooting the heck out of the mobs.

Currently, if I did not have the Tolan's bracer (I suspect it will be nerfed
to only conjuring up 5 arrows instead of a stack by the sounds of things) I
would have to spend some good money on arrows just to do a minimal amount of
dmg. If I fletch those arrows, I will be spending most of my loot in making
enough to shoot the bow during a long fight. This already exists in the game
but the time to reward just sucks. I know several rangers in their fifties
that still have their archery skills in the less than 100 areas.
