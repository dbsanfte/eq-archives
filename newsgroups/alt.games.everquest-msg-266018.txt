Okay, thanks to someone on EQ2 Vault boards, you can see the list of 
server names for launch! The link is 
http://eq2players.station.sony.com/en/servers_index.vm - just hit 
refresh a couple of times if it doesn't load at first. The names are as 
follows:

Antonia Bayle
Befallen
Blackburrow
Crushbone
Guk
Mistmoore
Najena
Permafrost
Runnyeye
Storms (French)
Unrest
Valor (German)

This doesn't specify which one is the "role playing preferred," but it's 
a start if you guys wanted to pick a different server. I think I'm going 
with the RP server this time just because generally the people tend to 
be more helpful and I do like to RP at times.
