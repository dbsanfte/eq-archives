Well if you are really serious and in my opinion tailoring is the hardest
skill there is because you can't buy the supplies you must hunt everything.
You also will need to be a master brewer and smith eventually too forget
buying off brewers and smiths it just costs way to much.  You are right on
the skinning knife don't use one ruined pelts are the easiest to find.

> now to my point:  Am I stuck begging lowbies for their ruined pelts?

For the most part yes, you could make an alt that way you'd still get the
experience. If you do make an alt consider a chanter you need lots of
thickened mana for wu's eventually. There are a couple places for experience
and supplies but it will take you forever.  Go to Dawnshroud Peaks and fear
kite Hoppers there pelts work just like bear, cat and wolf pelts you can
sell the flawless and supurb or save them till your skill is over 150 but
you'll also get damaged (read ruined) lq, mq, and hq (used for backpacks)
you shouldn't have any trouble at 45 doing this.  For silks Lower Guk or DL
are the only places I know of.  You have a long haul ahead of you I started
tailoring at level 5 and I'm now a 43 druid with skill of 135 in tailoring.
It does take forever and it does cost a lot however if you spend a lot of
time selling backpacks once your skill is 80 it can pay for itself and then
some.

Because at the high end of all skills nothing making the money tailoring
does.  Just a guess really but the best reason I can come up with.

If you don't want to sit around a lot auctioning this might not be the best
skill for you its just a part of it.  You can try the zones above for exp
too but they will turn green to you before you get enough of what you need.

> Tailoring is the one skill that I truly want to develop.

Best of Luck
