And me.

I see what you are saying now.
I read it as :
I haven't leveled, in a week, since I dinged to 51. 
(i.e. I made level 51 one week ago and have not leveled since)

Rather than :
I haven't "leveled in a week" since I reach 51.(implicit:now it takes
much longer)
(I.e. Level 51 took me a week now levels take much longer)

I just went blind to there being a second way to read it.

Ho hum
