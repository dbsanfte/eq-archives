Most people don't want to go thru the low levels again, so rush them with
P/L.
Yes your character is "crippled" with low skill levels but not at mid level.
By Mid level (40+) your skills will catch up, if you meant melee and you can
always use practice casting (as pretty much all casters, p/l, twinked or
not) need to for those skills.
I took a Shaman up to 30th in around the same amount of hours played because
I wanted a partner for my firends and my Rangers. Others probably want to
get a character up to a level to 2 box.
That journey up the levels can get real tedious when you've done it a couple
of times.

Monday  I saw a first level froglok Warrior with a Club Fu tag...I must
check what level he is now...I'd wager he passes my Mains (low 50's) by the
end of the week.
