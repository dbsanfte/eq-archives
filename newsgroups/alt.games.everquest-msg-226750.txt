On The Rathe, at least, that does you no good.  Very few of us seem to
realize that there is a "/lfg on" command, or that there's even a nice
little LFG tool that SoE gave us.  People would rather sit around and ooc
"Level way too high for my miniscule intellect Dipshit LFA" than even
consider putting up the flag.  It's sad... SoE gave us something that
trivializes finding groups, but people are too damn lazy to even use it.

OTOH, I've pulled people from the Overthere because the showed up on a "/who
all 25 37 lfg," so I guess a few people have a clue.

And here I thought LDoN was supposed to eliminate standing around for hours
screaming for a group.
