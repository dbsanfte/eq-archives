We're buying the self-same identical product as the raiders, complete 
with raid content, raid features, etc. They get more content, and more 
well thought out content then non-raiders do; that's not entirely 
unfair... after all... they consume it faster and need more of it... but 
lets not lose sight of whose paying for that 'extra' content... 
literally.

Hard to say. Few product improvements to EQs casual game have been 
'driven' by the the raid game, imo.

Twas an 'if'. It won't happen. But "if" it happened, then "that" would 
follow.

Again hard to say... EQ had a price increase as recently as this last 
year, right after the EQ2/WoW fallout, as i recall even.

Hmmm... maybe. In my experience at least either your on the strict raid 
schedule, or you raid-as-raid-can. If your not on a raid schedule you 
spend most of your time -not- raiding. I suppose its -possible- to be a 
one day a week player who happens to raid on that day every week... I 
don't know anyone like that though.
