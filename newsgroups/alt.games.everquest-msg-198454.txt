As I'm sure every one here has done , I started a character on the test
server and did the /testbuff command to get to 25th level(actually I did it
a few times to see the different gear you get for each class).

I quickly learned that being given all that gear and the skill boosts really
takes the luster out of the character.Earning your gear has a much more
satisfying feeling to it.
I now see how empty it would be to buy a 60th lev Wizard ,for instance, that
you have no history with.Not to mention the spells, I'm completely lost with
the spells I got with the /testbuff ,what do they do? there is no learning
curve.

Any way it was a fun experiment but I think I will stick with my 18th lev
Cleric and my 34th lev Druid ,...but then again maybe I just need to sit
down with my 25th level Shammy and see what makes Gelblek Crowfeather tick.
