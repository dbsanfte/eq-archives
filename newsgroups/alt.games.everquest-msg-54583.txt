Yeah, and realize that Rygorr comes off mobs that level 40ish people fight
for a reason.  If you're wearing Rygorr above 50, you're not keeping your
equipment updated to where it should be.  Every piece of armor on my ranger
is better than rygorr, and was better before rygorr existed, and my ranger
has _zero_ pieces of planes or velious quest armor (most pieces better than
TV armor even).

"Easier" != efficient
The only truly "easy" soloer is a necromancer.  Magician does qualify at a
few levels as an "easy" soloer.  Has nothing to do with efficiency though.


>My ranger only has about 70wis.. I concentrated more on str and dex

My ranger had 68 wis until level 50.  Never had a problem.  Still has well
under 100.

>So mana runs out very  quick

Ahh, I see your problem.  Rangers != wizards.  If you have decent weapons, a
single round of combat missed during the casting time of the spell is more
damage than the spell itself, particularly if you are doing fear kiting.

No clue.  I generally have my misses turned off otherwise I spam myself so
bad I miss fear or snare or root wearing off (or just conversation in
general).  I cast three spells in combat, snare, flamelick, and panic
animal.  That's it.  That's the most efficient way to solo I have found, and
it's better than any option a magician has.  In groups I might throw a DoT
into the mix, but I still do more damage swinging my swords than I ever will
casting.

Look, already answered this below.  :)

It sounds like maybe your disconnect from what I have found in comparing
magician and ranger is that your ranger isn't well-equipped and nukes.

A) Rangers (and all fighters) are equipment dependant.  Without good
equipment, they are "less" of a ranger.  Without good equipment, a magician
is still a magician.

B) Rangers aren't wizards.  Nuke to pull, nuke to...  nope, can't come up
with any other reason for a ranger, particularly a soloing ranger, to nuke. 
I generally don't have a nuke memmed, and half the time not even a DoT
(unless you count flamelick).
