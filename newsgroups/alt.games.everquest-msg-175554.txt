You completely contradicted your argument when you stated "Yes, I
personally intend to be a Jedi..." You and almost everybody else.

It won't matter how many other options are in the game, or how many
other activities they put it. If the majority of the players "intend"
to be Jedi's, then the game is either going to be full of Jedi's, or
full of pissed off players.
