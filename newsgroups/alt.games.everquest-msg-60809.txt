Verant says it is 3 hours on or offline.

However, players have said (and its been verified by witnesss) that
they died and did not get the corpse ressed until the next day and
still got an xp res. SO it seems like 3 hours on or offline is what
verant says so players don't assume there is a guaruntee.. but it will
be longer probably if you are offline.

I think if it was only 4 hours you'd certainly be ok. Id try to get
one before logging off though.
