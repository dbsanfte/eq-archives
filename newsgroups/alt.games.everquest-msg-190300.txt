 From the FAQ at 
http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheeverquestnewbiezonefrm5.showMessage?topicID=9.topic#q74:
***********
* HOTKEYS *
***********

Q: Where are my abilities?
A: They are there, just not prepared yet. On the right side you see some 
buttons saying "General", "Combat", "Social" and "Abilities". Click on 
Combat. Now you can see the 6 combat skill slots. Click on one and your 
abilities pop up (like KICK or TAUNT if you are a warrior). The same is 
with "Abilities", where things like "Sense Heading" or "Fishing" pop up. 
You can now select where you want which skill/ability to be placed. 
There is even an easier way to use these functions, by using hotkeys.(top)

Q: What is a hotkey?
A: On the bottom left corner or your screen, you can see 6 empty 
squares. These squares are your hotkeys. If you want to use a function 
more often, it might be a good idea to use a hotkey for it. Just click 
on a skill/ability ("Fishing", "Kick", "Sense Heading" and so on) and 
don't release the button. Instead of "using" the skill it will be 
connected to your mouse pointer. Drag it to an empty hotkey slot and 
release the button. Voila, your hotkey is created. You can have up to 6 
sets of hotkeys (changeable by SHIFT-1 to SHIFT-6 or the arrow buttons 
next to the number). You might want to order them in a specific way. To 
use a hotkey you can either click on it or press 1 to 6.(top)

Q: What else can I have in a hotkey?
A: A lot. For example: spells. Just drag/drop them from the spell/slots 
to an empty hotkey. However, this will NOT give you additional spell 
slots. It's just a reference to the spell slot. Another thing you can 
put in there is an inventory slot (again a reference) to quickly use an 
item. One of the most used functions however is the Social Hotkey. 
Example: You have learned about the command /yell to ask for help. To 
prevent having to hassle with your keyboard in a dangerous situation, 
you can put the command on a social key. To do this, click on "Socials", 
then right click on a social key you don't plan on using, to edit it. 
Give the key a new name (at the top) and put the command in the line 
(e.g. /yell). Then click "DONE", and the social key is changed. You can 
now drag and drop it over to your hotkeys. Every line is a single 
command. Tip: by entering /yell on the first line and /loc on the 
second, you will not only call for help, but also have a reference where 
you (eventually) died.(top)

Q: What else can I change?
A: You can remap your keys or several functions/commands. To do that, 
select the "Options" Button in the upper left corner of your screen. 
Then select Keyboard. There you can see the functions/commands and the 
dedicated key for it. One of the most important things to remap is the 
attack key (default is "A"), as mentioned earlier.(top)
