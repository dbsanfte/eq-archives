Reminds me of the one Velketor the Sorceror raid I've been on.  It was a
public raid, so an idiot had managed to slip in, and when we got down to the
final area, the idiot ran the wrong way.   Next thing you know Velk himself
was in camp.

I moved forward and tanked him while others tried to camp.

You died.

It was incredible ; )  saved from unconsious, not once, but three times in a
row.   I guess it wasn't 100% altruistic, since the druid was a member of the
raid too... but it was certainly a hell of a lot nicer than had he been
concerned with camping to save his own ass.   Between the two of us, we turned
what could have been a total wipeout and corpse summoning into a 10 minute
partial rebuffing.
