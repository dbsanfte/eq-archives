Ummm... Instill doubt goes up fast? Have you actually _played_ a monk? I
would wager that ID is the hardest skill to raise (especially now that you
have to be standing to use it). If you just keep hitting mend, it will take
care of itself, and it becomes useful before 100...just don't hit it during
melee in case it fails and you lose health.
