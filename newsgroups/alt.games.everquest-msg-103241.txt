Perhaps... However, every post responding has stated "When used to excess."
It is also a "Constant struggle" for an alcoholic.  Hard drugs like Cocaine,
Heroine and the like...   Doesn't require 'excess' to be hooked on it.
Smoking takes a few tries and it pretty much becomes addictive.  Short of
someone shoving a few dozen drinks right off the bat, you should become an
alcoholic.

This is why I debate this issue of it being a hard drug.  It does not
counter the need for consciencious self control and common sense, which
seems to be the major debate here.
