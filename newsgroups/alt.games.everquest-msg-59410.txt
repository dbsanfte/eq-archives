I said nothing about being instakilled by an archer. I said ambushed and
killed without being able to do anything about it. You may try to pretend
that the situation will never arise, but hopefully you really know better
than that. This is a PvP game...there will ALWAYS be one sided fights. I
don't care for them. They aren't fun, no matter which side you are on.
