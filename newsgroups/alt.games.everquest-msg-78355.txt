  When the engine went live, whether you had Luclin or not, they had
your system check to see how much RAM you have, and had it so the
program would figure out models you should have on or off for optimum
settings.  The first time you logged on after the Luclin patch, it
should have given you the option to change those defaults.  If you
don't have Luclin though, it shouldn't make any difference in the way
things look or perform (but then again, Umbra shouldn't have caused
problems either!)
