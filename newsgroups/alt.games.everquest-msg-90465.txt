Ewww.  Lokari, you are my hero big lover boy you ;p <grin>  I've tried,
hmmm, forget the name of it, Im thinking Codewarrior?  Something along those
lines.  Was nice when it didnt crash, though something that you can write in
a Pascal type language.  Should be very interesting as the last Pascal
program I've ever created was a BBS door when I wasnt working on the BBS
software itself.

Anyone have ideas for a Palm application?  Ive never been good at "thinking"
of applications to make, but, give me a general idea and I'll run all the
way with it.

Perhaps it because I just cant think of anything I persoally would like to
see used on a Palm <grin>  Hopefully people will reply to this as I too am
now ready to roll with it.  If this PocketStudio offers the power it states
it does, I will go forth with purchasing it as I did Codewarrior.  Peeps,
lemme know as my "palm" is itching to write a util/app as well.  Pun
certainly intended.

Jacobson


PS - Getting ideas before I start this 45 day trial period on the software.
