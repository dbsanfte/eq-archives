First come, first serve.

I just do not have the time necessary to play Everquest, so I wish to 
now give away my account.  *ALL* the expansions are registered for it 
and it still has an entire 3 months plus a few days left (I just 
resubscribed with a 3-month EQ card).

User Name:  stormic
Password:  mystorm

After you log on change the password IMMEDIATELY or somebody reading 
this shall take it from you.  Also, immediately post a response on this 
forum saying you took the account so that a bunch of others reading this 
message do not have to try accessing the account when it has already 
been taken.  Be polite, just as I have been polite by leaving this info 
here.

You do not need the CDs because the patcher will download 100% of the 
software.  Just enable all the options and do a complete file check and 
it will download everything.  In the past, the patcher did not download 
100% of the required files but in the last few months that has been 
improved (thank goodness).

Enjoy.
