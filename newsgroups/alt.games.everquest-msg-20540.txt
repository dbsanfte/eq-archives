Hi,

Had an unusual incident occur the other night.  Was running through East FP
towards the docks when my computer temporarily crashed (low memory).  When
it finally reorganised itself I continued running from the exact same spot
but I got the message 'You have become better at swimming'!  I assume this
is due to the system thinking my character was still running/swimming while
my computer really only had my character back where it slowed.  I would have
been about halfway between the gates and the docks when it happened. Any
ideas or is my assumption correct?

BTW, great way to raise your swimming without much effort!
