See, you're an adult.  Given the apparent age of the "OMFG! $10/mo!" 
crowd, it might be their entire allowance for a week.  Why, I remember 
when my allowance was a mere $5 a week, and that seemed like quite a bit.  
Certainly more than my friends were getting.  Granted, that was the late 
70's, and you could buy as many as 20 new comic books for that...
