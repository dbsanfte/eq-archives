Think about this for a moment...

If there are porting facilities...  in most Cities...  Probably with the
exception of the Moon cities due to the spires issue...  And you have a
character who is group porter and is hunting...  You will still here "Need
a port to WC"  Like, say...  South Karana.  As someone else mentioned
here...  People will want to go to Lavastorm.  Nearest city there is
Neriak.  Well, no High Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Wood Elf or Iksar (Since
Iksars are hated by everyone) would be able to go to Neriak without every
guard whacking your head, and mind you, guards are going to be sitting
ontop of those portals to prevent people from invading in force through
that obvious of an opening.

However, people also want to go to specific areas...  North Karana is a
good example, or Dreadlands, another good example, of convient, somewhat
safe areas to ride the spires up (GD, I don't consider a safe place if you
want roaming mobs slapping you around more times than not.  North Karan
isn't as bad with those)  These two places are not accessable by city
ports, where Gfay and Tox are.

Then there are some of the kunark and Velious zones.  Even if you get
portals to say... Skyshrine, Kael or Thurgadin...  You will have people
doing stupid things, like going to a KOS city, trying to find a way to get
out of there, even with camo/invis, some guards might have See invis or
will have it to protect those portals.

Also, one more thing that Wizards and Druids, more Druids than Wizards, can
do on Old World that can't be covered by city ports or spires - Banking.  A
druid can port out with heavy loads and return without any problem.  At the
same time, convience.  If a druid or Wizard can port you out of a dungeon
or a zone far from a city to a zone closer to a city and with less worries
about what is around you...  I think you would opt for the Druid/Wizard
port than hope to whatever diety you worship will get you out.  A good
example: Karnor.  People will pay for a port to WC, because they are
carrying some stuff, good, sellable stuff, and willing to pay to sell more
expensive stuff in EC but not risk getting killed trying to get from Karnor
to a spire because of the long trek.

While City ports will make newbie Barbarian from Halas be able to play in
Crushbone, it also means Druid hunting in Everfrost with IGs doesn't get
hassled by people to get ported to WC or Butcherblock.  At the same time,
druid hunting in EF doesn't get bothered by high levels who can't port to
other locations to go to a city to port to a convient other location.  My
alts would love this.  Being able to go to EC by hopping a spire to gfay,
go into kelethin, take that portal to Freeport and then run to EC.  My wood
elf warrior will still have to run to Feerrott or ask a Druid/Wizard for a
port there if I really need to get there, so it makes Druid and Wizard
ports just as valuable because I would need to ask for the convience of not
running through several zones to get to one, or hoping that I have not only
paid for a potion of invisibility, that it doesn't wear out while trying to
get the hell out of dodge in a KOS city.
