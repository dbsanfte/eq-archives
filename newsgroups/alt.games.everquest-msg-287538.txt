	Well, ok, enough is enough :-)  Why not just add a parameter to
eqgame.exe:  "eqgame.exe --character_levels=80"  so no one would need to
bother will all that messy leveling at all?  Heck, they could make it 
dynamic:  /level 80

	I used to love 1st person shooters like serious sam and unreal,
but was absolutely terrible at them.  So I'd get the cheat codes and grant
myself max weapons and so on just so I could run around and blast stuff.
It was fun but, well, mindless...
