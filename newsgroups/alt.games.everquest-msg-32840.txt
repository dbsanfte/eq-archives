Well, the point will basically become moot eventually. Politics has
become very much like building cars, there just seems to be one less-bad
way to do it, and everybody is coming around to it. If you were to look
at the party programs for the last few general elections throughout
Western Europe, you'd see that there is basically *no* difference
between left-of-center and right-of-center parties, with many instances
where the Socialists (or Labor) are to the right of the
Christian-democrats (o whatever the local flavor of Conservative is), or
the other way around. 

Even Communist and Fascist parties are much closer to the mainstream
these days, and bear in mind, differences are a lot more pronounced
during a campaign than afterwards in goverment.

Anyway, politics seems to have been reduced by trial an error to a
"lesser of all evils" state. I think that as soon as computers can
handle it, we should leave it to them.
