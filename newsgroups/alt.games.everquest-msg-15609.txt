I can answer that for myself....

I have been waiting patiently for my server to split. It is one of the
older ones and thus very crowded in prime time. The economy is glutted
with gear. There are more twinks/alts than newbies in the starting
cities. I would love to move my main characters (even naked), to a
green preferred server. I don't have a bad reputation. I just don't
want to start over on a newer server, when I have invested so many
hours in the characters I currently have.

Cheers
