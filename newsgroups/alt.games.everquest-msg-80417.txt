If I remember correctly, when Frodo allowed Tom to handle the ring, nothing happened. Tom Didn't
even feel the the Ring's corrupting influence. As to the Ents, I have seen footage of them tearing
down part of Orthanic and it was impressive. I don't think Jackson could leavce out such a major
part of the story as the Ents are. The cloaks and pins were given to the Fellowship in Lotlorein as
was the rope that Sam later uses on Gollum. 
Since it was the Blade of the Westeenee (i can't spell either) that damaged the Ringwraith leader
and allowed the chick from Rohan to kill it, I wonder how that is going to be explained in the movie
since it came from the barrowdowns...........
