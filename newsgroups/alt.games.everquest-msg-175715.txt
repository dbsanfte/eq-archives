Actually, that's why I picked that area.  I think it wouldn't be too out of
line with the story to have the Iksar tolerate the Frogloks as inferiors to
be used, at least enough for PC Frogloks who haven't done anything to harm
Iksar factions to be able to pass through Cabalis, if they don't wander
around too much.  This would also allow for some nice quests, such as quests
to help the Froglok slaves.  Maybe add some more access to the Cabalis
underground, so the Frogloks can sneak through.
