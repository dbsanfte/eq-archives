LOL.  Yes, my Druid is so bulky I had to get another account to keep him in.
Now he is almost fit to be pulled out as needed.  Only L27.  By next week I
expect to have L29 on him.  Then I can get my cash back on all the spells I
bought him.  I need the cash for my next set of spells!  L34 Chanter spells
aint cheap.

So now that I have a packable porter, I can whip him out in a pinch.
Eventually I'll tool him up to L51 for that Superior Heal punch.  Great for
keeping my pet alive if I solo.
