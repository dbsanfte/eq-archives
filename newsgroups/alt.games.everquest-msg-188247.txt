Paladins make good tanks in tier 1 planes, where the raw mitigation power 
of a Warrior isn't necesary.  With their stuns, they can generate aggro 
incredibly quickly, and with their heals they can save group members better 
than an SK or Warrior.

Also, with the introduction of frogloks and paladins being 1 of 5 classes 
they can be, it's not all that surprising ;)
