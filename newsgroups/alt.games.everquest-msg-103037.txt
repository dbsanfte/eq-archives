AHAHA.

Actually I love it here and would live no where else. We have every
convenience, type of store, complex of movie theater, best buy,
software etc, electronics store, borders, barnes and noble, etc but
because the city is not an old urban area but very well laid out it
takes less than half an hour to drive anywhere.

It sounds like the sticks on paper but is quite a good place to live.
We are growing so much now we even finally got that horror that larger
cities get:

Starbucks.
