And from the Not-Very-High-Level-Characters Department....

Took my 12 chanter to Blackburrow and sauced some gnoll guards, elites and a
commander or two (with a group of 3-4).

Did a couple of quests from Surefall to Qeynos.

Nice druid made me a gnoll fur cloak with my 80+ pelts I'd saved up...

Tried making jewelry (got skill from 48 to 49) making non-magic
electrum/malachite jewelry. Failed 8 of 10.  Grr. Too expensive to work on
the stuff that is near trivial to me.
