WW 1 was also when combat fighter pilots came into being. There were

single wing fighters smashed the airforces that had old biplanes.

Lots of mostly green units with a few combat veterans. Very few.

The major increase in military units in the U.S. after December,
1941, made it certain many units would be over 90 percent green
troops.

Nations also found out officers who were good in garrison filling
out reports may or may not work out in combat.

Same thing. The Henry repeating rifle was in use by some units. They
decimated those who attacked them.

True.

I've noticed a few people skipping the tutorial... then they run
into the zombie or skeleton outside Qeynos, and their first level
toon gets smashed. Then they squawk for help with the tough
monsters.
