That goes for all classes. I had the "pleasure" of being in a group with 
a level 65 cleric with epic and the best AA title. After 1 hour me 
(druid) and the necro managed to talk her into trying to Cheal instead 
of casting Sup Elexir to heal the pally with (a 4700 hp buffed pally, i 
got more HP buffed, but she was REAL good), and even after thas the 
managed to get killed 2 times due to sitting down around 1/3 sec after 
casting any heal spell, Cheal or Elexir.
