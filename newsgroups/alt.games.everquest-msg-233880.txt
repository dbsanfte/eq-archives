From the shadows, the mysterious "Woland"

conspiratorially whispered:

Interesting that there would be so much support for actually
*eliminating* the bazaar, or at least tradermode (I got the thread
from alla's, not safehouse, so I don't know if the same solutions are
bandied about there).

Have to admit that would probably put a big dent in the problem. No
more macrobuying. If it were to be done someone would have to actually
be running the characters.
