Most of us couldnt be bothered just trying to get as much cash as possible.
Camping for cash is not fun.

However the 30+ game does get alot better, well actually more 40+.  Simply
because alot more places open up for you to goto.

Maybe he doesnt play much, or maybe just has fun.  My enchanter twink has
been in his mid twenties for ages now, I dont level him lots, just do other
stuff, buff people, etc... and he still has a fairly big /played time.

Level as quickly as you want, do what you want... just have fun, screw
leveling.
