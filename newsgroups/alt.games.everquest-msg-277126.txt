No, he's really saying that +15 to stats is really not that useful.

Although as the responder pointed out there are some uses... +15 str 
does increase your weight limit quite a bit. +15 int does make a

I'm sure they won't do it though, too many people have already sold 
(hahaha ... who'd buy it given the price of the doll, thanks sony for 
rendering zillions of items obsolete) or destroyed (in the case of no
