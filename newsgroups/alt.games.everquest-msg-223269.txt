Well, it came with a map, poster, figurine, 2 thick instruction books, 2 CDs
and a nice looking box - it seemeed worth a go to me. I had never seen or
heard of Everquest before and I wasn't put off by the "International Credit
Card Needed" label eblazoned on the box. I was willing to give it a try.

I've never come across software that doesn't allow 2nd hand use before -
until now. Paid ï¿½8 or about $14 for it and I thought I had a bargain! ;-(

Gareth.
