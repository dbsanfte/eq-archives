Well if you are really interetsed in what is coming up in the future
you should follow this thread:
http://tinyurl.com/2k4kh

if you want to know what they say will be in the next patch go here:

But in the wonderful (/sarcasm off) way that SOE communicate with their
patrons we already know that the second post I gave you is a crock of
doo doo.  For example from other boards we know that this next patch is
meant to include a complete revamp of the AA backend, don't see that on
their list.  Now slated to be a nine hour patch so is one of the
biggest I have seen.

The first area has only just been started by Hobart (EQ Programmer) and
gives a much better insight into what is happening on Test and
therefore likely to make it to the main servers.  My suggestion is taht
you keep and eye on this one as it is more likely to give information
than Brenlo's non-posts.  That guy (Brenlo) needs some lessons in how
to be a Customer Service manager.
