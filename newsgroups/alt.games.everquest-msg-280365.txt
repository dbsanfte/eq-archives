PoJ basement have netted me upward of 2.5k/hour plus aa xp.  If you
put the diamond and blue diamond in barter you can get even more easy.

A 6 hours grind there with a sk for tank, shammy for slow and heals,
and my beast for DPS gotten us a little over 15k total plus 3 aa
points each toon to spend.  This was before JC limit went to 300 and
basement were often visited only by those looking to get flags or 7th
hammer.
