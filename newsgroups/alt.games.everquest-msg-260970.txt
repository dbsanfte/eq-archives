Easiest method: you FD; send pet to attack some mob in a group of mobs; pet
gets aggro only on the mob he is attacking; you use pet discipline; pet
comes running back with just the one mob.

You can eliminate the FD, but if your pet dies before the mob it is pulling
is out of social range of the others, then you get all the mobs chasing you.
