Foul language
Profanity
Cursing
Obscenities

Yeah. Right. Again, I ask you, how you can possibly think that using
any of the above is not a bad thing? By *definition* they are
offensive. Therefore, it is to be expected that you might offend by
doing so.

Refusing to recognize this can only be seen as rude and selfish. One
of this mindset merely refuses to be held accountable for their
actions is all. If they can convince that what they are doing is not
offensive, and at the same time place the blame on the victim, then
they can feel all the better doing it.

Does it foster ill will more often than not? Yep. Say to a passerby,
"Excuse me..." Then say to the next, "Fuckin' excuse me..." Take note
of the different responses you get.

This is a ridiculous exercise in futility. Congratulations on getting
me more than a little worked up about it. Honestly, it's not my job to
fix what your mother didn't do right in raising you.
