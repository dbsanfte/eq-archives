Well I don't think very much, but then these things are relative:

I died in 26, and took the opportunity to jot down my naked and
dressed stats:
        Naked    Geared    Gear Effect
HP    589        1037        448
AC     364        583        219
Attack 213        227        14 (no weapon in hand)
                         520 with smouldering brand, forgot to
pick it up before putting gear on
Str     108        127        19
Sta    134        139           4
Agi    83            94        11
Dex    75        78            3
Wis    80        94            14
Int      52        didn't write this down for some reason
Cha    45        45            63 (heh, I have 63 points in cha
gear to swap in for purchases)

Poison    15    18        3
Magic    25    28        3
Disease    15    28    13
Fire        5        18    13
Cold      25    43       18

+mana gear: 170 extra mana
Mana Preservation II
Spell Haste I
Improved Healing I
Extended Affliction II

I have an ER II item but I've never put it on to date.

Weapon 9/22 1hb, str +3, procs 14 DD at level one
Regent Symbol of Innoruuk I did with my 57 bard to kill final
mob... but I bet I could kill that mob now at 28 solo.

Biggest Twink part of all: 500pp slush fund for KEI (or better
POTG or sometimes BOA or early in life, my favorite, COEarth),
remainder of 1Kpp slush fund at level one (also used for buying
every single spell no matter how lame they seemed)

Funny thing is, hunting in FM giants I earned back about half
what I've blown in slush fund so far, if I'd get out of lootless
zones like Paladul and Marus Seru I could probably stop being
"twinked" there, and purchase those buffs legitimately.
