I believe that the only stats that matter are attack and defense. Your attack
skill is formulated based on your dexterity, offensive skill and proficiency
with your chosen weapon. Your defense skill is formulated based on your
agility, defensive skill and armor class.

I'm pretty sure that it comes down to attack vs. defense, with strength and
weapon proficiency determining the amount of damage. In all this, I have no
idea what the actual formulas are.
