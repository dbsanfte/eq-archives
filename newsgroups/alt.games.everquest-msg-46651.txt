Well it's moot now. Logged in this evening and look here, an early
Christmas present...

Everyone on the server is now 24th level. All skill levels appropriate
for our levels (master defense, double attack, parry, dodge etc etc..)

Woohoo! Of course, everyone made a beeline for Unrest and HHP, and
promptly found out that fighting level 20+ mobs using level 9 gear is
not the smartest thing one can do. The sad news is they did nothing
about cash, so few if any can afford all the spells they now have
access to... *sigh*

Verant... such a tease.

All newly created characters on the server are automatically level 24.
The funniest thing you'll ever see in your life is entering West
Freeport, hitting the gates, and seeing 10 or 15 level 24 PCs running
around slaying bats and rats for cash. I about died laughing.

The server goes "live" after the patch on Monday - all PCs wiped and
we get to start all over again. Looks like I'll be going swimming...

(see? 23rd... Note to self. Do not tangle with a named orc while
wearing patchwork and CLOTH armor! hehehe)
