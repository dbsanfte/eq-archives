I play a druid on Drinal, and I forage constantly.
Veggies, roots, berries and fruit are obvious as to their use ineating or
baking, however, I get some wierd items which no EQ site has been able to
explain the use of to me.
Now I know that in real life, there are lots of thigns you can find and just
throw away, but I cannot believe Verant would do that on EQ.

If anyone knows the use for water reeds, Drench flowers, lichenclover and
other non-edible non-quest related foraged items, please let me know. And if
you're on Drinal and need something foraged, just tell me, i'm maxed out at
level cap of 160 (level 31).

Thanks,
    Chamudy, Druid 31st, Drinal
