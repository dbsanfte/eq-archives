I personally maxed 1hs until 13 when we get dual wield. Then I slapped a
1hb/piercer in the off hand and forgot about it until I noticed the skill
was maxed.
At 16 I put half my pratice points into 2hs and spread the rest over 1hb and
pierce. This is double attack level.
Now I am easily maxing every weapon skill every level.
I am only 32 now, but the only things I have trouble keeping maxed are bash
and kick, since I am a troll I can slam for bash without a shield, but it is
still harder to keep these both maxed, but that will be fine once I am in
the 40's.

Maybe in the 40's I will get 2hb to 100 or so with points and get a 2hb to
practice with.
