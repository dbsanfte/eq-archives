A GRAVE ISSUE

Alan returned to the corpse decay timer discussion to clear up any further
misconceptions regarding the time in which corpses decay. Also made clear
was the fact that there are not two seperate timers, offline and online, but
instead these are the same timer, seven offline hours being equivalent to
one online hour and vice versa.

So essentially it is one timer but it counts the time in two separate ways.
So, you can be offline looking for that rez. Just for the record I have
rezzed corpses that the player was offline for 28 hours, at least that is
what they have told me. So the timer is not always accurate. I also ran into
a guy in Guk that had a petition be cause he went LD while trying to get a
rez and couldn't back into the game. When he finally got back in 6 hours
later his corpse was too old to rez.
