I don't care for the new models much, but this feature is even more
annoying...

Here's another  peeve; they don't necessarily work anyway!  My
dwarf is unable to have simple red hair brown beard, whatever I
set up, changes as soon as I zone.  I petitioned about this on release
and again just last week... last week got a response saying they
are aware of the problem and were working on it.

So not only do I have your appearance issue (in terms of -all-
male dwarves looking like potatoe dumplings) but I have my
own... I change appearances every time I go from one spot
to another!  Its so bad that I turned in my SS helm for the one
with graphics so I could hide my face!

I remember once rejoicing in finding graphic free helms because of
how stupid most helm graphics look, and how they hide the
one voluntary appearance choice we can make... now I'm
deliberately concealing that appearance with one of the dorkier
looking helms in the game!
