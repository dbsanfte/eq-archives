Great. Now her proof for the fact that this doesn't happen is the fact that she
can't produce anything saying it doesn't happen.

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
