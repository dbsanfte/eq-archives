I'm writing this as I meditate back to FM sitting on a rock in Stonebrunt 
Mountains. I'm *alone* in the zone, which must be dissapointing for the 
Verant designers who wanted SB to be the new LOIO. So why did it fail?

A few reasons occur to me:

-No melee bind points.
-Nutty aggro, which compounded with the density of mobs turns SB into an 
add hell to rival Frontier Mountains.
-Leviation a near requirement in certain areas.
-A pain to get to, and a pain to get out of.

Of course, all these problems are self sustaining, since they are made 
worse by the fact that the zone *is* undercrowded to start with, so 
ports, levitates, trade, help and everything are hard to come by.

So, what is there to like about the zone?

-Lots of mobs
-Feared mobs just walk a few steps back and forth
-*Very* reasonable loot, compared to LOIO.

So what should it be done to fix it? I think that a Druid ring and a 
couple of bind points for melees would go a long way towards improving 
things... I'll probably /feedback it the next time I'm OOM.
