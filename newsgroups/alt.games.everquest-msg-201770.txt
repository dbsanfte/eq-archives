Hi, 

  Just wondering if anyone here has ever successfully camped the named
seahorse in SG, Fellspine. I've spent maybe 5 hours at where I think
he spawns and haven't seen one so figured I'd ask. Down to the bottom
of the well in SG, take the south underwater tunnel to a 4-way, then
south at that point into a long winding tunnel with a couple of spots
where 3 random mobs spawn. PH from what I read is the roaming seahorse
down there. 

Thanks in advance, any info would be greatly appreciated. 

Rgds, Frank
