Shrug. I have a 1gb AMD 3000+ XP and Geforce 6800 GT 256mb which
otherwise has pretty poor parts (no SATA, sucky motherboard, etc)
and it runs ok for me.

I've got a lot of eyecandy turned up, but like you I turn complex
shaders off for particularly laggy areas... I started in freeport
and *never* turned it off till I betrayed, and then in blackburrow
went slideshow like and turned it down.

Big factors I found to help were turning down water quality and
shadows. Otherwise, I have flora, max character textures, specular
lighting, etc, all on and a complex shader distance of 41. Environment
shadow killed me, but just having character shadows seems ok.

A lot of it may be down to your particular subjective sensitivity
to frame rates though... I find a consistent 20fps with occasional
'hitching' as it loads textures or whatever perfectly acceptable.
Some would find that completely appalling.
