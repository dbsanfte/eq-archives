Hmm, maybe...but not for certain exp encounters. If nothing else the use of
Defensive will allow a LOM cleric the chance to claw back a little mana in a
constant-fighting environment. For mobs like the Myconid Spore King you
better have a Warrior tanking or 2 Clerics in the group. At 58 I was there
with a 60 TRL SK in full PoG armour (my warrior still has Indo BP and Legs,
Cobalt and up in other slots) and he could _just about_ tank as well as I
did. At 59 with 1250AC and 4200hp I still have to use Defensive against the
King or risk sucking the Cleric dry of mana.

The boosting of the plate-hybrids to Warrior-equivalent Defense skill was a
great thing but we still have the edge in Dodge, Parry, Riposte, AC and have
more HP without even considering the disciplines.
