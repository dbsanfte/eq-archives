}My server (Cazic) has a bazaar channel.  As far as I know there's no way

It's bazaar on Ayonae Ro, too.  On some servers, it's auction or 
marketplace.

Ayonae has port:port and taxi:taxi set up (last I checked) but there never 
seems to be anyone in there.

Hrm...  How hard would it be for someone to set up a little website where 
people could go put in the channels they know about, along with what 
server and a short description, so we could just look them up?  It seems 
pretty trivial, but I dunno any of that Perl or MySQL stuff...  I'd be 
happy to add such a page to my little geocities site if someone can make 
it work there...
