Noted.  I might have been projecting :-).

Well, I --SAW-- somebody do it 8 days ago, so maybe it wasn't as
disabled as they thought. :-)

I think the assassins are trained by Ashenbone Drakes in Hate or
something.  "Anybody have any assassins on track?" "Yes" "Ok,
get ready, then...they'll be here in a minute"

This I was not aware of.  I DID know that some folks had been trying
AoE spells to do the same thing, though, with mixed results.  I don't
know anybody personally who'd been using the Warrior AoE, though.
I bet it was found by accident, and a fun time was had by all in the
ensuing "entertainment."*

*see definition of VI's version of "entertainment" above...I love that
quote :-)
