    If I got one, I'm not sure I'd give up my SSB for it. That says a lot
about how poor a helm it is. No WIS/MANA, no HPs, no resists. Blech.

    Yaulp is for paladins, and encumbered clerics. Yeah, the effect on the
helm is junk. So are some of the other effects, though. Pacify? For the
pulling cleric that wants to suicide?

    I'd trade it to them on a permanent basis, removing it from the cleric
spell books, if we could get some of the Divine spells paladins have. I'll
even throw in our Reckless STR line AND our Ward Summoned line!

    The Sol Ro armour at least had resists on some of the pieces.

    Yay, the cleric clown suit! You wouldn't have that if you weren't a WIS
cleric, you know. ;-)

    Skip maxing WIS, and try and get a balanced set of armour. My current
suit, at level 58, is pretty poor for my level. But even in "pretty poor"
I'm at (with my buffs) over 900 AC, 2850-ish HPs with Marzin, 181 WIS plus
roughly 150 MANA, and resists in the 40's (Magic and Cold over 50). With the
standard buffs I get from a group - GRM, C2 - I'm more than adequate for the
tasks at hand, and never get bashed around like a rag doll.
