I really like to see these messages from people who I haven't raided
with a lot.  Not assisting is the worst crime in all EQ Raiddom, and
its always astonishing to see how many people don't do it.  Seeing
that assist hotkey going off tells everyone that doesn't know good
old reliable Johnnyfive that he's on message, not just good at guessing
who to kill.  It also tells me -when- he's attacking.  And that
had by Brell -better- be only after MA has called for assist.  Let
the MA solo the mob or die if he hasn't called assist yet.

As cleric, I have numerous healing hotkeys.  When I first join a group,
I use them.  After a while, I'm down to only announcing completes,
among friends not even that.  The hotkeys are for communication,
and if the communication isn't going to change anyone's behaviour then
there's no need to spam it... but part of the communication is "I'm
on the job, here's what I"m doing to who, when.  See?  Cleric has
the plan down, don't worry."  In a raid some of the heal messages
are critical in order to time heals, to not duplicate efforts, to keep
from bouncing off someone else's celestial... so I use the messages
when they might matter and not when healing my group members
who don't have aggro but are being chewed by riposte/AOE.

In the case of tanks, the message "I am using the assist button, and
I'm assisting the right person at the right time" is just as reassuring.
Eventually switching hotkeys to an assist with no message will cut spam
down, but then I hope you still have a message one that you can use
when MA dies or SA/TA have to off tank something... helps to know
who is working on which mob, and that Assist message spam after
MA dies really helps focus everyone's attention on the new MA.
If I see five people say "assisting Joebob" I'm sure going to strongly
suspect Joebob just got a battlefield promotion to chief sponge.
