You're right, but looking at the wrong case.  Suppose you're hitting
exactly 50% of the time, and 5% of those are normally crits.  Inspired
Rage will exactly double your damage: you hit 100% of the time, and 5%
of those are crits.  However, Cleaving Rage does not quite double your
damage because some of your hits would have been crits anyway: i.e.,
you still hit 50% of the time, and all of them are crits, but that
means only 95% of your hits are being doubled (the ones that wouldn't
have been crits otherwise).

But the break-even point is still pretty close to 50/50 hit rate.
