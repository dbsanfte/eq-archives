Well all since I started this post I shall end it here.  What started
as an innocent question in another post has degenerated into a flame
war led by the two least helpful posters in this NG.

I am intriuged by the insecurity of both Sisson and DarkTyger that they
have to attack people who have asked a genuine question.

My question .. why is this the only newsgroup that I inhanbit that
actively flemes/abuses top posters? is obviously not going to receive
an answer.

Some have attempted an answer but it has been lost in the flames.

I shall therefore stop posting in this newsgroup .. I will respond
direct to posters seeking help (where I can resolve their addresses)
but am saddened by the fact that the silent majority has been so silent
atm and left it to the purile efforts of Sisson and DarkTyger who
really add nothing to this group and detract from the help that some
such as Graeme Falbane, Winterfury Thunderwulf (a newish poster), Lance
Berg, the Richard Lawson Chronicles and others provide.

A newsgroup ... I would like to think, like our game of Everquest is
about assisting others .. putting a point of view (reasonably in my
view) and contributing to the community.  In my view Sisson, DarkTyger
and others who have jumped on the bandwagon here do not do so and in
fact detract from our game.

Overall I am still saddened that I have not received an answer to my
question ... this NG is not reflecting my experiences over many years
in EQ and that disturbs me for what is meant to be a window on our game
to the outside world.

Be well all.

regards

@ndrew
