Got to remember one thing here: Some people can't easily take that
boat... I helped a guildmate kill Sir Lucan, and am consequently
KOS in East Freeport, so taking that boat is a bit of a risk for
me. Of course, if I don't get a port within, say, 15-20 minutes,
what I do instead, is take the Barrel Barge to the Ogre Island,
and swim to the shuttles =) For some reason, my swimming skill is
now 188...
