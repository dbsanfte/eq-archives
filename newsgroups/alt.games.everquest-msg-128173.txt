Yes if only we had a virtual cluebat on the other end of the line :/

A lot of people aren't stupid though, they are just lazy, that's the 
real problem. When it comes to IT they think "I won't bother with this 
I'll let the IT people do the thinking for me, that's their job".

When I am presented with these types of answers which the person has 
obviously put no effort into thinking about, I try to talk down to them 
and be as demeaning as possible without sounding like I am meaning it. 
This usually makes them feel damn stupid and starts them thinking 
quicksmart.

"What email program do you use?"
"What do you mean?"
"The program you use to send email. Read out what it says on the icon 
you click to read your email."

That's just plain rude of them. This is the point where you continue at 
your normal volume level until they get the picture.

You don't snap, you share the story with others and have a good laugh! I 
  also like to switch off and read newsgroups if the conversation gets 
too boring ;)
