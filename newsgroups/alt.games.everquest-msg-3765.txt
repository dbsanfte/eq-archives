That's my way of limiting non-stop pullers... stop healing the
puller.  When they are down to 25% health after a fight and I don't
heal they usually get the message.

What I've noticed is that in good groups you don't need a whole
lot of communication... the casters report when they are low,
the puller has a sense of how the battles are going and how much
casting has been going on.  After a heavy battle the puller will
check status, otherwise he'll keep pulling.
