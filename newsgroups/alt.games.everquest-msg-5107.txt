On Friday night (4/20) M'lady and I were hunting Griffawns and Rabid
Griffawns as well as Borer and Scythe Beetles from the gypsy camp in
NK and had the swarm decend upon us.  Although it was quite
interesting, we handled them in a nice battle due to the sheer numbers
of them (She a 19th Cleric and I a 21 Warrior).  Shortly after they
were all dead we were attacked by Zahal the Mad I think  his name was,
what appeared to be a very large Ghoul.  Red to me and took us out
without a problem.  No Swarm Mother around.

Saturday Night the swarm decended on us again this time with a very
large Swarm Mother who was red to me at 21 and killed both of us.
Since I hadnt conned her in time originally I chased her and her brood
down when I repopped and like I said, she showed red.  Her and her
minions were relatively slow though as I made it to the EK bridge in
time to turn, con and give her a few scratches in the blue/green
chitin.

I have never seen her in WK and the above 2 events were not GM events
it would seem as there were only 6 of us in the zone the 2nd time and
no GM's online.
