I recently did a brand-new install of EQ on my son's new computer.  The
downloads took an hour or so.  So?  Go and get something to eat.  Go watch
TV.  Remember that your account is server side.

I think a bit of patience would pay off better than possible screwing it up
ALL OVER AGAIN!!!

Hee Heee!
