You're right, thats the pose!

However, she also looks anorexic, boney, the clothes are starting to 
hand off her, her "boobs" as mentioned above have shrunk down a size; 
its like the difference between Courtney Cox early in Friends and now. 
Its even there in the facial features.  I'm sure it wasn't deliberate, 
but if you look at it this way, its high art; desperate for attention 
now, aging and with her audience distracted by the fresh new 
competition, she's gone off the deep end, buying into the media demand 
that skinnier is prettier, she's stopped eating, or is sneaking off to 
the privvy to vomit after every meal.  Its a metaphor for EQ1 itself!

Makes me wonder if the artist might really be putting one over on the 
corporate stooges at SOE, instead of simply unintentionally creating 
this masterpiece.
