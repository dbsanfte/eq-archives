Interesting, last night a group of four friends asked the same
question of a friend of mine. The best we could do was;

Warrior: The best tank in the game, which is good protection
against being swarmed. Taunt is really nice also for when
someone else in the party picks up agro. However the main
reason is....

Cleric: Complete heal is fantastic, and a warrior is absolutely
the best use of the efficiency and power it generates. Then you
have nice AC and HP buffs, low aggro heals and ressurection which
is a party favourite. They also have stuns which are useful for...

Enchanter: Keeping the enchanter alive. Enchanter can buff haste
on the tank, mana recovery on the cleric and has damn near
exclusive ownership on crowd control. Which is sort of cool when
you've got a small group and lots of nasty stuff out there.

And that's it. Given this group you have some pretty good power
and nice synergies. What's more picking up additional party
members should be incredibly easy. "Tank, Cleric, Ench looking
for more...". You'll be beating em off with a stick.

As for the fourth position. Well, the warrior doesn't deliver
enough damage to knock down mobs quick enough, so...

<melee damage dealer>: The best here is a rogue who can help
the warrior knock mobs over without stealing agro and using
the clerics precious mana. However a monk is a much better
puller, has some nice utility skills and is almost as
damaging. Third place would be a ranger to add melee damage,
snare and SoW, but not as damaging and a lot more fragile.

What you don't have in this is ports and evac's, which would
be awfully nice to have. But both of these skills only help
you when you enter and leave an area, less when you're doing
well...which is what you aim for.

(Not that I know much, having caused a duo wipeout in our
first dungeon crawling practice. And having char's you want
to actually spend time playing is pretty important too).
