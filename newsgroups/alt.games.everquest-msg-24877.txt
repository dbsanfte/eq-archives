Sounds VERY familiar

This is what happens to a lot of mid range guilds, I think.
Many of the high level players from my guild have been doing the same for
sometime.
A bit of history;

Norrathian Elders was formed by some of the older (in age that is, the name
Elders is actually a joke at our expense :ï¿½)) members of Emerald Phalanx.
The guild grew quite nicely with some high level characters incoming who
then brought in other high level friends.
We then became allies with a larger guild called Clan of the Roc (CoR) The
idea behind this was to enable the higher level players to participate in
raids with CoR where we did not have the numbers to be able to field, but
slowly (as there is no shared guild chat between allies) it became obvious
that they would have to move over to CoR. What was our loss became CoR's
gain and this went on and on.
We have lost too many players to list now, some were founder members of the
guild.
I think, if you wish to take your guild upto a level where it can compete
with the "uber" guilds then you have a uphill struggle. You have said you
have surpassed your guild leader in level already, this isn't to say that he
isn't a good leader but it is an indication of the ambition he has within
the game.
Our losses have been taken badly by some (in particularly, one) of our
officers, who have gone on to cause more problems with the players leaving,
ensuring that we would be unlikely to ever be able to call on them for help.

I'm sure this problem runs across the board on all servers, new guilds start
all the time, some go nowhere others grow in strength but only up to a level
(like yours and mine has) I have seen none, that I can think of, that have
grown to a challenge the established long time guilds on Bristlebane.

Good luck, you may find you have to take the easy way out yourself, oneday.
Me? I expect nothing from my guild other than conversation on guild chat...I
want for little I cannot gain myself at the moment (easily pleased) when/if
this changes I may review my situation but I'd hope I can achieve this with
help of other "allied" guilds and not by leaving.
