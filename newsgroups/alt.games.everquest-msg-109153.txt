Agreed.

What you do in MAKE BELEIVE ( ie: ROLEPLAYING ) does NOT reflect
whether or not you're "evil". Only what you do in real life. I
roleplay an evil necromancer who delights in tormenting druid slaves.
She's fun.

In real life ( RL, folks, not online on Usenet. ;-) ), I go out of my
way to help my friends. I'm polite. I volunteer my time. I don't lie,
cheat, and steal. I am very non-aggressive. Am I evil just because I
have fun roleplaying an evil character when nothing else in my life
would qualify me as "evil"?
