    Hmmm but a badly equipped knight will be pounded into paste against
planar mobs. Please don't give people the impression that just because we
can hold agro with low level spells we don't need to think about equipment.
It's harder for us to actually tank than it is for warriors.

    I know you probably weren't trying to give that impression, but your
words are readable in that way.

Cheers,
