I would chose the Gnolls in Splitpaw.  There is already a story-line about
them taking-over Splitpaw to make it their home...  it's located in an area
fairly removed from another city...  and a very de-populated zone in game...
(ever run through the Karana's anymore? Aside from the "spider farmers" in
EK,  it's sooo empty, it is spooky)

Splitpaw itself is plenty large enough to accomodate the vendors, bankers,
guilds that a city requires.

There's a good nemesis race (the centaurs) readily available in SK...

SK could easily become a newbie garden...  betwixt the animals, aviaks,
centaurs and skellies...  Spires and druid ring are nearby in NK, although
they could add a much-needed book to SK.

Also, the gnolls of splitpaw are physically larger than their Blackbarrow
cousins... and they seem to be more 'contained' to that zone (there is an
off-shoot, that roams around EK, but they are mostly undead, IIRC.)

my two cp's...
