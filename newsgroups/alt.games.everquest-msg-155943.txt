Oh I am so glad i am not the only one who has been getting this it seems to
be when you go from a close view place to a far view place i.e. in tofs I
zone from first lvl where it goes from a view of a wall to a view of the
library through the doors and crash. was thinking a reinstall was the thing
to do but maybe a /bug?????
I have been having this problem since the patch of last week.
