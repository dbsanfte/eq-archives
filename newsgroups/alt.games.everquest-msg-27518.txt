There is a pretty serious bug with charm type spells right now. It isn't on
the front end side as far as I can tell, more like the AoE when you do a
/pet kill like Harmony AoE.

I can't figure out how to reproduce it intentionally so I haven't turned it
in yet. Don't want to look like a major idiot vs minor one. Suffice to say I
have seen multiple pets that weren't even targetted with befriend animal
responding to a /pet kill. The rule/design is such that you can only have
one pet or summon at a time. The multiple pets, including stuff that just
happens to be in the neighborhood, repsponding is an outright bug.
