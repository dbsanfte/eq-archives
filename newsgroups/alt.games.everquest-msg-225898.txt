What I've read is that the implementation is that mob damage vs.
Warriors is capped at a DI of 19.  That is, a mob's max hit vs. a
Warriors is less than the max vs. any other class.  If these
reports are true it should matter more to raiders who worry about
their MT being one-rounded by the big bad nasty, than to XP groups
who'll see a slightly slower drain on healer mana.

As Lance (I think it was) pointed out, the difference comes if they
give Warriors a "no-opening required" hate boosting skill.  If you
know your Taunt succeeded you know to use your hate bump to solidify
your position atop the list.  Even if lag forces you to use your
hate bump before you know if Taunt succeeded you'll have a better
idea where you stand on the hate list.  Another use:  knowing that
your Taunt failed in a case where the mob sticks to you after some
caster does something with a lot of hate warns you that your aggro
is positional and thus fragile.  Knowledge is power, the more you
know, the more effectively you can adjust your tactics.
