A number of reasons - one is that I don't need two sets of the CDs.
Just one set of CDs and two sets of keys.

Also, if I wanted to set up a third account then I would have to buy
the whole lot of CDs again and wait for delivery.  Sometimes the
delivery can take days or weeks.    With getting a key one can get the
thing in an instant.

I didn't say that this should replace the normal method but should be
an alternative.  Most of the folk to whom I have spoken would prefer
to buy the keys on-line.
