  I had the same decision to make a few months
back.  I ended up going with the Xbox, because of
the built in hard drive (since I was buying the system
mainly for sports games), plus I simply liked the Xbox
controller better when I compared the two systems at
Best Buy.

  I don't regret my decision a bit!  Great fun, great graphics.
When I was a kid, I played Adventure and Combat on the
Atari 2600.  If they'd had these systems back then... shit, I'd
probably never've seen the light of day...
