Let me add a "me too": I agree that it wasn't the problem that the character
was PL'd; my paladin, Marrtuk, was also mostly PL'd up to 56, but along the
way I took the time getting my skills up.  All of my two-handed weapon
skills are above 200, as is piercing and one-handed blunt.  1HS is still
170ish but currently that's not a concern.  His offense and defense is also
maxed.

I think the problem is the rush to get a 65 berzerker, everyone's taking
shortcuts.  Heck, Triton is holding a contest - the first 65 zerker gets
into Triton, no questions asked.  Everyone's so eager to strut their 65
zerker over everyone, they neglect to work on the important things like
weapons skills.  And that is pretty stupid.
