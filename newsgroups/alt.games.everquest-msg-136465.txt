Happened to me in Kedge on Friday night.  Happened to quite a few of us
there in zone, including our only cleric.  I think I was the first, I let
everyone know, and told them I was camping out.  I did manage to camp out,
got back on to find everyone but the cleric either dead, or camped.  Cleric
managed to camp out, I gated out.  We did get CS rezes for everyone that
died.
