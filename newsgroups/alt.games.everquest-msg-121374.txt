The biggest downside to charming is when it breaks and the creature
turns on you. Now you have your ex-pet, and your target creature both
coming after you. Having the ability to escape when this happens is
essential if you are going to use charm extensively.

Of your two choices (Bard or Enchanter), I would rate the Bard as the
best charmer, and the one class that relies heavily on it. It is one
of the best tactics a bard can use when soloing in outdoor areas.
(Charm Kiting, and Swarm Kiting)

The Bard Charm only last 18 seconds, but if it lands it seems to
always last a full 18 seconds. Enchanter charm is completely random
and unpredictable. It has the potential to last much longer than 18
seconds, but it can also break in 2.

Bards also have the ability to run away (songs that increase run
speed), and can recast charm while moving (Bards do not have to stand
still when singing songs).

Bards get their first Charm song at level 27

Enchanters get thier first Charm spell at 12
