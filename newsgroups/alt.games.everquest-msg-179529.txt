You've not listed *any* factors that would have increased the *per* *user*
cost over that time.  Sure, total cost has gone up as they expanded to
handle more players...but revenue goes up as they get more players, too.

In fact, per user cost should be going *down* as they expand, because the
variable costs should be roughly proportional to the number of users, and
the fixed costs are spread over more more users.

If they were profitable at $10/month with 100k subscribers, they would be
more profitable at $10/month with 400k subscribers.

The most likely reason for the price increase was that they realized that
they *could* do it.  Suppose the per user cost is C, and they have N users.
At $10/month, they make N(10-C).  Suppose raising the price to $13/month
makes them lose n users, so at $13/month, they make (N-n)(13-C).

They come out ahead as long as n/N < 3/(13-C).  So, if the cost per user was
really low ($1/month), they could raise prices from $10 to $13 and come out
ahead even if they lost 25% of their users.  At a more realistic cost per
user of $7/month, they come out ahead on the $10 to $13 price change as long
as they lose less than 50% of their users.  I don't know how many people
quit because of the price increase, but I'm pretty sure it was under 50%.
:-)

The coming of DAoC and AO provided Sony with a lot of information on the
dynamics of the MMORPG market.  DAoC in particular has grown to about 40%
the size of EQ *without* hurting EQ.  Sony certainly analyzed the numbers,
figured out how many EQ players tried the other games, and how many came
back (most of them).  Sony knows from looking at the DAoC numbers, and from
playing it themselves, that it's a good game, and so they could figure out
from the number of EQ players that tried it and came back that people
develop a loyalty to their first game.  They could also tell from the
numbers for the other games that people will pay $13/month for a game.
Putting that all together, they were, I think, able to figure out how many
people would quit EQ over a $3 price increase, and that number was way lower
than the 50% that would make such an increase fail, and so they went for it.
