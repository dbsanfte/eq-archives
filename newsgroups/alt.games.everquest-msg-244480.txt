The prices at this hotel for a formal Balticon internet cafe were
prohibitive. If your friends sign up for Wyndham-by-request for their
hotel room, unless something has changed since last year, they get
wireless wi-fi connectivity inside the hotel as a comp. The worst case
is there was a $10 per day 10Basae-TX ethernet port service in the
rooms for guests which people have used in the past and were happy
with. The Wyndham-by-request program also gets you a free snack at
check-in so there is something for everyone. Of course if the most
interesting thing you can find to do at Balticon is surf the internet
then we have failed and we don't intend to fail.
