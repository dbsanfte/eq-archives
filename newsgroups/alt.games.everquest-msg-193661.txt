It is truely amazing how many total fucking morons come out of thge woodwork
on usenet.

So, Rich, after you wipe the spittle off your keyboard in an attempt to
write a response, I hope you realize ( know, not much of a chance of that)
that almost no one will see (or care about) the response as you have just
been plonked by a goodly majority of people on this board.

Annie has been a great member of this community, usually having something
intelligent (or at least funny), to say while I cannot think of one
contribution (if anything you have to say can be called that) that you have
made in the last 3 years.
