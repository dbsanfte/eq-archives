What did I miss?

At the moment, I have no interest in LDON- I'm a 61 necro, and the odds 
of my finding a group is slim enough! Is there a reason I should get 
this expansion? LOY was for the bank, POP was for the POK book 
travelling system. Does LDON have a great reason like that?

Iunderstand my guild split up while I was gone, so I'll probably go back 
to the guild I helped found about 2 years ago.
