Luckily, no one is rioting over EQ. So we can dismiss that apparently
pointless comment.

When *I* am paying money to play a game, *I* will decide who I am
willing to play with. Someone with no regard for the rules is not
worth playing with.

Likewise in EQ - the GMs are the only one with the authority to
penalize a player for a name rule violation.

>And Verants naming policy is anal.

In your opinion. But it's their game, and you either follow their
rules, or don't play. No one says anyone has to *like* the rules. Just
that you have to follow them.

A game is defined by its rules. Even a hack and slash game. Just as a
good soccer player doesn't arbitrarily ignore the no-hands rule when
he finds it inconvenient, a good EQ player doesn't ignore the naming
rules just because he doesn't agree with them.

>Relax, enjoy the game and don't worry about other peoples names.

Since you've so enthusiastically grabbed on to the soccer analogy,
would you then tell a soccer player not to worry about it when someone
on the other team uses his hands?
