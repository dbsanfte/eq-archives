Like a lot of powerful tools in EverQuest, Tigir's Insects is controversial,
powerful in the hands of a good player and suicidal in the hands of a weak
player or a player with a weak group.

It's an AE Slow that will attempt to do about a 50% slow on all mobs in the
cast area. You can be affected if close to the area, although your
groupmates cannot. This spell used to be considered completely suicidal
because there aren't many things that cause hate more than a Slow, but they
recently modified it to add -200 modifier to hate *if* it lands. This change
has made it far more useful, but you'll still hear stories from people that
it's a useless, dangerous spell. Dunno, since I won't start using it for
another 4 levels, but I sure intend to experiment with it. The reports I've
read support any view of it you're pre-disposed toward. ;-)
