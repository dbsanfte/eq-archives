"Amphetamine-type stimulants are not recent creations. Many of these drugs
were synthesized at the turn of the century for medical use. In the Second
World War, amphetamines were prescribed for fighter pilots and others who
had to stay awake and alert. "

This doesn't state American pilots for a reason. It was prescribed to
Luftwaffe, Japanese (Kamikaze) pilots to promote courage. It was discovered
by the British that they were taking these pills and for a short time they
also took them.

American pilots?

"During World War II (1939-1945), Royal Air Force pilots, as well as those
of the German Luftwaffe and elite units on special missions, used pervitine
and methedrine. Recently, a number of Russian journalists claimed that
"Bromantan", a substance with similar effects, had been used by their army
in the same way."

This is what you'll typically find. People see comments that either "troops"
or pilots from Britain and Germany as well as Japan were using amphetamines
but you will not find references to American pilots except from people that
do NOT have their facts straight. American pilots were scared to death of
taking the pills after rumors of loss of concentration and impotence.
Although a few may have taken them and kept it secret the general feeling of
the pilots was that the pills were taboo.
