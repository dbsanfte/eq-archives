Form a raid... 2 groups, 1 of 3, 1 of 4.  Where's the issue?  You can all
play together, then.

: and in a recent interview Brad says "It's about

never

Again.  Where's the issue?  Group leadership skills should be for a "group".
You also should not get group leader exp for groups of 2, imo.  The
leadership benefits are generally designed to benefit multiple people
dealing with pulls.  The only ones really affected by this are the regen
abilities.

2

Ahh, the LDoN complaint.  Only 1 group in each instance.  These were
designed for max 6 players.  So just use one of the other 200-plus zones
available for your 7 people.

: All of these designer ideas are flawed.

Then quit.  No one is requiring you to pony up 12.95 a month to play.

: We just wanna hang

That's what most of us do.  We work within the limitation imposed.  All
designs have limitations of one form or another.  You deal with it.  If you
don't like it, don't pay for it.

My guess is that you will find something there that will annoy you.  You'll
complain.  You'll whine.  And you'll offer no concrete constructive ideas.

My guess is that you will also not learn how to properly capitalize.  Nor
will you learn the the word is Ueber when not using an umlaut.
