It seems to me that this was recently changed.  If your pet does damage it
takes a certain amount of the EXP regardless of wether it outdamages you or
not, but it is only a small amount.  I don't think that it ever takes half
the EXP.  Of course I could be wrong, but it seems I remember something to
this effect in a recent patch.
