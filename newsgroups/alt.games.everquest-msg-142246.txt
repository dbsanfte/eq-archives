Bleh, my server sucks.  SoD only 300k if you can find one, was a BoC in the
bazaar last week for 750k, same vendor had the below mentioned 100hp
(crystallized acid) bracer for 250k, Helmet of Rallos Zek for 400k, fungi
for 40k (and ironically that was the cheapest one for sale in about 3 days),
skeeter leg earring for 75k, incarnadine bp for 50k.
