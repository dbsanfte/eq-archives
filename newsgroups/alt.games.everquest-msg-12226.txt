This is my opinion and that of a 35 cleric. Ranger's are not my nightmare IF i
have a good tank who knows how to press the Taunt hot button. I am hunting in
OT and will take a ranger over a druid any day. Once the big healer(me) joins
the group the druid seems to usually say to himself "oh cleric is here i can
take a nap" and from there on out its "SoW and snooze". Well with a good ranger
in the group dealing out damage with the typical 2 Yak's its a lot more helpful
then the druid looking up new pokemon on his other computer.  And the Ranger
has SoW/Root/Snare..everything druids are needed for in OT. Now agreed-- every
once in a while you will come across a dumb ranger who thinks they are a tank.
I tell them as nicely as possible that I dont want to tell them how to play
their class but they need to let the warrior take the damage. So far this
method has worked and I have been in many successful groups with rangers. Also
rangers have track and keep an eye out for *cringe* dragoons. Well thats one
cleric's opinion anyway.
