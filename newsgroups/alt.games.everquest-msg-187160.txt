Hi guys,

I'd just like to say a much appreciated thank you to the guild of 
Knights of Marr on the Mithaniel Marr server for their absolute 
generosity tonight.

Was a harrowing corpse removal from the mino-cave (Steamfont) for a lvl 
16 barb. war but they helped me out greatly and then gave me a couple of 
swords which have helped me out greatly.

Much appreciated - very glad to know that people are like that on EQ 
having gone for 10 months to serve for my country overseas with the army.

Many Thanks,

Natasha
(Koutoufides on Mith Marr)
