I think that this kind of practice adds to the game....sure you might get
burnt a few times, I paid 300plat for some darkmail gauntlets :((, but the
thing is to learn from your mistakes.

Item pricing is something anyone playing EQ should have at least an idea
about, definitely about your own classes' staple items.

Trading is a skill too, the only way to advance in it is by actually
figuring out the rules for yourself.

1. Keep an eye on the prices for items on auction (easier now with the new
chat channels, you can switch on the auction channel while you med/wait for
port/wait for group).

2. The only pricing rules are, how low the seller will go and how high the
buyer will go, (Price Checks, eqprices.com etc are guidelines...nothing
more)

3. Some players think of trading as PvP, so watch out!
