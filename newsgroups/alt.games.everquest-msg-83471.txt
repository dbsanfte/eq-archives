lol man if sony served horseshit on a plate you would rush out and drop 50
bucks on it to be the first in line. your the consumer you should care if
the company cares what u thinks. its that attitude by gamer of i am to
stupid to care as long as i get to play. that is why titles are being
released bugged because they know you go buy it anyway. consumers will
either direct the gaming industry for the better or companies will direct it
for profit.
