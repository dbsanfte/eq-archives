***Are possessions really possessions unless you are yourself possessed by
them? I mean you can own many things but if someone steals them and you
care little...or if you share them with everyone...or if you can leave
them behind at a moments notice....then are they still possessions?
Besides all that...just because someone writes a song about something does
not mean that they have to live that life do they? 

I mean "Good morning starshine..the earth says hello! you twinkle above
us..we twinkle below"....

Now uhm....did the lyricist REALLY Twinkle?
