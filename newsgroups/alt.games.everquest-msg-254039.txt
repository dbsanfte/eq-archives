Carsten! Wow :)

Yes it would be. :D After all these years, after playing AC, SWG, DAoC, 
Neocron, and Horizon, I finally decided to actually play the grand-daddy 
of them all and play EQ since they were offering a free 30-day trial. :D

I must admit I'm enjoying it right now. Ever since I left AC every 
MMORPG I've tried has lacked the depth and "feel" of AC. I think EQ may 
lack the type of combat I truly enjoy (i.e. AC's paced combat) but it 
definitely has the depth of content that I've missed since leaving AC.
