    So true it deserves repeating. If you have a good play experience with
someone, by all means try and remember them and re-invite them next time you
play. Not only will you be happier with folks that don't make stupid
mistakes, but THAT guy you keep inviting will remember YOU next time they
need class X to go somewhere. And all he'll remember is, "Yeah, our groups
ROCKED with them in it!"
