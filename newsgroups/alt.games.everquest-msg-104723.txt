I'm not quite at 55 with you yet Jazz, but I'm feeling that post 51 burnout
big time. I hardly ever log Dominic on anymore, I'll probably never get out
of 53 with him, and if I do, I'm sure 54 will be it for me. It's just to
difficult to get into a decent exp group after 51 to make it worth while
playing if you don't have several hours minimum to play. Which is part of
the problem, I have a lot less time to play than I used to, and seldom do I
have several hours I can play without interruption anymore. Raiding is fun,
but you need 5 hours at least if your gonna raid, so when I can log on for
an hour or so lately it's to play one of my alts.
