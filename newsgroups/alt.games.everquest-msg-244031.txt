Well the biggest method of DPS isnt effected by gear or raid status
For as long as enchanters can charm mobs and equal the DPS of multiple
potime geared rogues, dps is one aspect you have zero worries at all about.

It is a long fight, the last time I killed him, my chanter got stuck in the
bridge zone geometry (couldn't move, couldnt cast, just totally stuck).
(group makeup was cleric, and me 3boxing warrior/monk/shaman). Cleric healed
the warrior (duh), shaman healed monk (rampage) and some minor dot dps. I
used defensive 3 times that fight =p

Bryn is another mob where charm totally changes the balance. hasted charmed
giants is silly dps.
1 pet = 4 melees, hurray for class balance!
