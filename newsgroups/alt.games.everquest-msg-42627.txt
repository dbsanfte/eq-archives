(Crap deleted)

FYI: I know Adam Kerman, the real one, who had _nothing_ to do
with that post. It was a forgery by someone who is upset with
him. Adam (the real one) has posted in some newsgroups explaining
and documenting this, but he obviously didn't catch all the
groups that the forger is spamming into. Since there are like
35,000 newsgroups nowadays, he couldn't hope to.

Those with a moderately technical understanding of Usenet can
examine the headers and quickly see that it was a forgery.

Unfortunately, Adam has been barraged with harrassing and hostile
emails due to this forgery. We can't do anything to undue that,
but we can at least stop wasting net bandwidth by responding to
the post.
