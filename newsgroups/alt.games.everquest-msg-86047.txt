yeah..

what level is your cleric. What's his/her equip at.. aka wisdom/str/ac?
super twinked? or just have friends that are willing to help. IF the cleric
is still a low level. easy. 1-5 anywhere.. just to gain skills. 5 -15 unrest
15 25-sola 25 35 lguk 35 40 solb 40 49 DL once they are a bit higher. you
should start looking into getting a friend (melee) that is super twinked to
do all the dmg killing... not much a cleric can do cept maybe have the
chanter cast rune on ya, and have the druid cast thorns on ya.. other than
that your skills wont go up for shit, and you will have a terrible time
getting them up at a higher level..

other than that good luck!

60 cleric is what I gots so I know mah stuff!
