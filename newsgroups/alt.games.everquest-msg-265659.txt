Doing a search in all of the Forums for the past 3 months, while it gives a 
lot of hits on +kill +stealing, most of them within the past month are due 
to a post in the CoV forums that. A brief scan through the listing of 
messages doesn't show a lot of people complaining about kill stealing.

I admit the possibility of not reading the proper boards. I tend to focus 
on the blaster, scrapper, controller, defender, CoV, Dev Digest (love this 
one) boards. I also look at the infinity server forum. I also admit the 
possibility that I have not simply been reading the forums for long enough. 
It has only been about a month and a half that I have been following the 
boards.

Where do you see most of the KS threads/complaints? I will gladly retract 
my statements.
