Some issues with my news server so this is a bit out of sequence
The following is a response to my previous post about powder on time
cards:


The money part seems an unnecessary step, why not just put the powder 
right on the box?  Put the box inside a paper bag so innocent
bystanders
don't end up touching it.

I love the powder to hands to time card angle, though, that answers 
Annie's question regarding my UV idea, of how she's supposed to go
thru
the whole company checking hands with a UV light.

Question, though, where can she get this UV powder?

My new post starts here:

Money was used so there was no loop hole for him to say "well she gave
me her lunch" and stealing money much more serious.  But the main idea
is get the powder on the time card.

This is where I found info on the powder
