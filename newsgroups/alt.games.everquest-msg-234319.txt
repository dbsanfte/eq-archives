	But it's a different kind of aggro managment, isn't it?  When I
solo my cleric I root park adds, nuke the desired target, and if it beats
on me that's ok because my goal is either to root it again or finish it
with melee.  The only health bar I watch is my own, and I can always gate.

	When I group my cleric, I root park adds.  Otherwise I never nuke 
until I'm *positive* I won't pull aggro because I need to be free to, well,
root park adds :-) and more importantly of course I need to watch 5 other
health bars (not just the tank!  The chanter, the off tank, the people
caught in the AOE DOT...)  And I *can't* just gate because I have a
responsibility to the group so if I get to 10% health I hit divine barrier
and yell for help...


>Even if you quad kite, getting another add means you will have to zone.

	Hmmmm?  I usually just snare the thing and let it tag along
until I can throw it some dots or something...  Eventually the quad
will die and I can kill it, too.  Or sometimes I charm it and let it bite
the mobs in th rear for a while :-)
