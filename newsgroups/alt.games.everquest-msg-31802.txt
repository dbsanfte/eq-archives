Are you talking about a lack of respect, or a crime of the century, make up
your mind.

It most certainly is a lack of respect.  What are rules in games for?  If
you can't answer that one, what is the rule breaker saying to the rule

fucking idiots for following lameassed rules."

Nah, no disrespect intended!
