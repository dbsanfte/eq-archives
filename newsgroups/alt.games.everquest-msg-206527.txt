Hear hear!  In this area, I think SOE (Verant actually) did a really
good job with the hot key and socials interface.  They gave us a
little flexibility, but not enough to really automate things, and make
some activities less tedious
(like hitting the sense heading button 5 gazillion times to skill up
to 200)

Now, people have circumvented that using EQmacros or other similar
programs that are driven off the log file, but the usage doesn't seem
that widespread to me.
