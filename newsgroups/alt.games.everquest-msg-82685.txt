I also got problems sometimes. One thing that happens sometimes is that I
have no mouse in the character selection screen after having selected
a server. Mouse is sitting in upper left corner, umovanle. Going out of
EQ shows an error popup box, something about memory. The second thing
I had (first time) is a total bluescreen/reboot. After bootup, some popup
error window said something about the NVidia driver.
