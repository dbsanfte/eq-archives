    Nice to see another PoV - also good to hear from you again Martin...

    My guild has one SK, and one monk - but probably more than half it's
current members joined in the last 12 months, so I would guess it's far more
susceptable to trends than older, more established guilds where folks have
had good gear for years.

    I guess that judgement is fairly subjective - I haven't seen a monk tank
SINCE the nerf, so I guess I have no hard data.

    He's got a SoFW, I've got a WMBS.

    My melee is slightly more than half his, but when you add dots, my pet,
etc, I get uncomfortably close.

    For logs, I've got:

    a burrower fight - I logged him at 80dps and me at 91. A small margin,
but the fact is I shouldn't be anywhere NEAR him.

    A couple of Tactics fights:
    him    me
   100   144
    96    61
    78    76
    123    78
    87    111
    105    101
    77    105
    141    100
    123    73
    173    98
    79    83
    91    67
    114    140
    97    110
    134    92
    95    85
    130    109
    98    94
    95 121

    Averages 107, 97? Did I mention I was pulling and tanking throughout,
and probably had a dead pet for some of those fights? :)

    There is no way in hell I should be anywhere NEAR this guy in dps.
Meanwhile, the mage in the same group *usually* managed to output more
damage than both of us put together (and I know for fact he was half-AFK for
bits of that log, not nuking as much as usual), and we had a 63 Epic
berserker with almost no AA's (I think), who easily kept pace with us.. Now,
do you actually want me to send these logs somewhere? Or were you just
interested in the results?

    Monks are a DPS class and should be outputting equal or better than a
mage's DPS. They aren't even close at my stage of the game.

    My game. My usual group isn't ready for hardons, and the "normal"
setting, well, I can pull 4-5 and it's the only time that adventure gets
vaguely exciting. Our other places of grouping atm are basically tactics,
where pretty much the same rule applies - 2-3 is fine (We have no crowd
control), more than that is overdoing it. Oh and we still hit veksar every
now and then. I can tank 2-3 veksar mobs myself, and i can't recall a pull
of more than that there. I don't quite have elemental access.

    On the plus side we're going to try a hardon with me FD pulling soon.
I'm expecting to run out of time for the first 2-3 tries, but I hope after a
few attempts it becomes viable.

    I think this might be a difference of viewpoint thing, and also come
down to what you mean when you say tank.

    Do you tank stuff you'd *normally* have a plate class tank in your
group? Or do you just tank when the pressure's off, doing stuff that's
pretty easy? Can you tank hard ldons?

    Lot's of places I *can* solo if I'm willing to either Kite mobs that
give good experience, and thusly sacrifice about 75% of my DPS, OR I can
have 100% of my DPS and kill babies that barely give any experience, or fear
kite same. Fear arbitrarily being resisted from early-mid 50's mobs onwards
has completely trashed my soloing.

    How your SK buddy gets viable experience out of it is guesswork to me.
Does he kite, or does he have some insanely cool vampiric thing going?

    Would that be the swarm kiting bard, the one grouping with a charmed
pet, or the one who's twisting mana and melee dots that add 50% to the
group's DPS?

    Still, I can agree with your statement. A bard trying to do DPS directly
might be outdone by a pally. I've never tried to compare it.

    A lot of paladins who are damned brilliant at playing their class are
saying it. One in particular I group with most days is skilled enough to
pull/tank on a hard LDoN without a single piece of either VT or elemental
gear - with a shammy healing. I suppose that might not be the greatest feat
out there, but it DOES say something about his ability, I believe.

    their port spells are less than half as desirable as they were when most
current 65 wizzies started their class. I don't think I've heard a wizzie
say much positive about porting in a while.

    Yeah, it's far higher than average - I did list them in the top half, I
don't think necros are currently getting hammered as such, but they ARE
being eclipsed by classes that are easier to play AND have more utility.

    I can see the good, and regularly do. But if I posted 4 pages on what I
think is good about my class, nobody would READ it, much less reply. Or
would they? useful exercise?

Thanks for the post martin.
