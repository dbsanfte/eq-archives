Why not just swim to the Combine Teleportation Chamber and just take a pot
to wherever you're going?

HEHE My guild gets a kick out of the fact that I can sometimes beat guild
druids to where we're going (and I'm an SK) because I use my workers hammer
(from OT Outpost) to gate myself to OT outpost then jump the ship to TD and
swim to the pot chamber.  BANG... from there I can get to any city in
Kunark/Antonica instantly.  And I'm able to do it invis so risk of death is
nil.

I can't think of too many dungeons in the game that are more than a 15
minute or so jog from the nearest city with SoW (I always have a few 10packs
in my backpacks).

My worst case scenario is about 45 minutes from time I arrive in OT till I
get where I'm going.  Best case was about 15 minutes.
