As have I, and I have the same problem.... Accept it, or move back to ME
since neither Creative nor Verant seems to be able to fix the problem :( I
have tried just about everything, but no go.

Same here..... *ALL* other games give *PERFECT* sound and video, except for
Everquest. Video is great here, no problems at all... maybe try new Radeon
drivers. I have a Geforce 2 card. As for the sound, i still can't quite
figure out why it will not work correctly...
