I don't see a problem with items like the architect's scepter and
the like - it's the fishing bait and foraged stuff and giant snake
fangs yielding 1100+ that needed fixing.

Since my BL's points are primarily from scrounged low end weapons
(FS, Velium) and an hour farming GSF's in EK (40k tp) I expect his
points to drop dramatically.

Since he only had 75k - I've decided to see how they handle negative
numbers :)

I'm currently running:
Vengeances X
Swift Arms 5
FT5
+150 HP
+ 10 Sta

For a grand total of 148 pts every 10 minutes.  In today's play session
I used up 7k TP :)
