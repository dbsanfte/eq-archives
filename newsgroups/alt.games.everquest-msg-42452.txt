Druids have a very easy time getting into a group 50 and above,
especially if they grouped and had many friends before 50 instead of
soloing so much. Druid can do a lot for a group 50 and above such as
Evacing while also having support healing, ensnare, good regen,
resistence spells, etc. Plus its easier to have such a person in the
group who can tp when you want to go elsewhere.

From what I've seen though none of these have much trouble really.
