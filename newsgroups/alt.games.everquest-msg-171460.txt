Oh yeah, forgot about MSeru.  Nice safe little soloing zone.  Now that they
have made the Low Quality Hides useful for tailoring, you can make a little
money in this zone as well.  (just a little mind you)  The nice thing about
MSeru is the way aggro works here.  The only things that will aggro you
outright are the Zelniaks and the Lightcrawlers.  But the good news is that
the guards will kill these MOBS for you.  Hoppers, Grabbers and Beetles will
not aggro unless you are fighting another one of their kind.  So, if you
pull way back to the Santus entrance you are pretty safe.
