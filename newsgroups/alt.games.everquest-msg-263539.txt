I was thinking about binding my halfling rogue (lv 1!) next to the PoD and
going over to Dranik Scar (sp?) to scout around but i don't know rogues well
nor do i know high level mobs. Can the ones' there see through the
sneak/hide even if it's successful? I tried scouting about with a character
just drawn up to be a throwaway, but he died within seconds of zoning in.
Then a cleric kept casting a 96 rez on him; where were you when my 59 druid
got smashed, eh? (*g*)

I rather enjoy twinking a character with 100 pp of bazaar bought goods and
racing about madly. Being a low level melee is so much more relaxed!
