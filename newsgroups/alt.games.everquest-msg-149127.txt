Zones I was forbidden according to regs given:
Maiden's Eye, Umbral Plains, The Deepshade, Fungus Grove, Griegs End, Plane
of Air, Plane of Fear, Plane of Growth, Plane of Hate, Plane of Mischeif,
Sleeper, Ssraehza Temple, Temple of Veeshan, Veeshan's Peak and Vex Thal....
when I left. What I found interesting was I could explore Ahkeva Ruins...
which is accessed only through ME. That's a neat looking place. So is Dragon
Necropolis.

When I started as a guide, pre-luclin, here's the list:
Sleeper's Tomb, Temple of Veeshan, + all planes. No mention of VP in mine.

So I went once and wandered around. Wandered out the back door that took me
to Sky, because, well, I had no clue that's where it went.

In the course of duty, I was called to Mischief, Fear, and TOV. So I stayed
a little longer than I had to. Oops.

What are they going to do, fire me? Giggle.

I know... you just can't get quality volunteers anywhere.
