Fishies :)

They're not that bad, and won't follow you out of the water. 

Heh, some of the mobs at the docks are getting up there.  If
you're pulling, you might try to find a way to extend your
clip plane, last thing you want to do is bring 2 Creepers back,
or worse - 2 Consorts.  Any group that's XP'ing there, instead
of in PoV, PoS and beyond, will get eaten by 2 consorts.

(the spiders (Creepers/Consorts) are farther up the hill, and
usually a seperate camp on Lanys, but often the dock group gets
accidental pulls from there)
