The typical exp group is tank+healer+slower+3xDPS.

tank = warrior, Paladin or SK (Pal/SK preferred) - ranger in a pinch.
healer = cleric (preferred), druid or shaman
slower = chanter or shaman (couple of other classes can slow, but
    nowhere near as well)
DPS = any class *except* for cleric or warrior in my experience.

Add to that all the hordes of bot clerics and warriors that basically
exist solely to help on raids (but are often added to exp groups for
2-boxing) and getting a group for a cleric or warrior is not nearly as
easy as you seem to be suggesting.

If I can group 50% of the time for 100 exp, and 50% of the time for 10 exp
(total 55 exp), and another class can group 30% of the time for 100 exp
and 70% of the time for 70 exp (total 79 exp), it's the latter class that
has an advantage.

For a warrior these days it's more like 30%x100 + 70%x0 = 30 exp. For an
SK I've seen people saying that soloing exp is as good or better than group
experience (so you're looking at 100+ exp). I can't speak for Paladins,
but a 3:1 ratio in experience that can be earned, on average, is NOT
balanced.

I'm deliberately avoiding raids here. Raiding has an entirely different
set of requirements; I'm mainly concerned with the amount of experience
that can be earned by regular mortals. :-)
