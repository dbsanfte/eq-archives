Properly implemented in that it applies to the gay-hater for killing a
gay man because he's gay, but also applies to the gay man should he
kill someone because they were straight.

In other words, properly implemented means it doesn't protect just one
specific group - it protects everyone equally from a kind of crime.

By logical extension of that argument, the person who accidentally
runs someone over with a car deserves the same treatment as someone
who does it intentionally.

>Why should two killers get different sentences because of motive?

Search the archives on that one - law documents are full of
explanations for it.
