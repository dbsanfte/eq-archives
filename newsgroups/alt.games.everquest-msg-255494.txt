In terms of gear, yeah, that's true there is nothing wrong with my gear. 
In terms of content, no, I want to see more than I do.

/Shrug
Lief set me up for that one by saying that you don't need the uber-gear 
for one group solo content anyway. So I'm saying fine, lets set it up so 
that you don't bring your uber gear to group/solo content. That works 
for me. And puts us on a level playing field when we group.


> And someone had the gall to say it WASN'T jealousy?

Its not jealousy. Its a balance problem when raiders are so far out of 
range of non-raiders that they can't help but sneer at their non-raiding 
groupmates.

And those non-raiders would like to pull they're weight, but Sony has 
not really given them a legitimate way to do it... unless quitting their 
job and playing daily during prime time is what you consider a viable 
option. Soloers and one groupers should not be at such a dramatic 
disadvantage when engaging one group/soloer content.

My raid gear proposal elimantes that imbalance.

You call it a nerf to raiders, so be it. They need more challenges 
anyways. And at least it doesn't 'dumb down the game', but makes it 
harder.
