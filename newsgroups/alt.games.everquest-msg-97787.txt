I would rank Shar Vahl up there with the best of 'em for leveling.
It has lots of level 2-3-4 mobs, which are crucial for advancing 
past level three, and it's chock full of quests. The downside is
cash -- pretty much nonexistant except for the rare rusty weapon
drop from grimling skeleton.

I would still rank Field of Bone on the top of the heap by virtue
of the curscale armor quests and that some drops do fetch more 
than coppers. Among old world zones, Everfrost is my favorite.
