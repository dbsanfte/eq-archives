I beat my head against the wall for about a week on this one.  Finally
came up with a solution.  Exit Everquest.  Open up the UI ini file for
your character.  It is in the everquest directory with a file name
like UI_CharName_Server.ini  .  Edit the file, do a text search and
find the section called [SkillsWindow].  The Xpos, Ypos, Height and
Width values on my files are all set to 0 ... so the window is
opening, but with no size.  Modify the values to something like 200
for each value.  When you log back in, the skills window should now be
visible.  Seems to be a bug in the creation process, as I tried
deleting the file and it was recreated with 0 values.

Hope this helps.

Patrick
