Wizards do not even rule ae groups . I have been in many fine ae groups that
had no wizards and did just as well or better than the ones with wizards. Ae
groups require point blank aoe spells, chanter stuns , cleric healing and
buffs. Upheavel and earthquake are just fine for point blank aoe . I wizard
can fit in unlike many other classes but calling them necessary is an
outright lie. No ae group can exist without a chanter, they being the real
basis for such groups. My favorite ae group has 2 chanters , 2 clerics, a
druid and a magicain. Might not be the best possible but they are all
friends so it is fun to ae with them.

Quad kiting timeless golems is certainly easy for both wizards and druids.
Ill let you in on a little secret though. A monk soloing in the grey can
pull and kill about 8 mobs in the same time you are medding up after the
quad. And thats asuming you have enough friends to be wearing kodaics and
potg and oh maybe items that add up to flowing thought 10 or so.

Quad kiting is efficient but thank god it is not as good as a regular exp
group or it would be nerfed hard. I have many fine wizard friends that i
MAKE a place for , but I also recognze that in so doing so I am slowing down
exp gain not increasing it most of the time.
