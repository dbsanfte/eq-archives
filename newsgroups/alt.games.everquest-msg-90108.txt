That is no solution really.  Latest mouseware drivers are part of
the trouble.  Windows XP doesn't like them so much.  I have Logitech
keyboard and mouse.  I also just upgraded from 98 to XP.  Took
forever to get it to scroll in chat window without crashing.  Could
not use Logitech keyboard drivers or the latest mouse drivers if I
did one of the following would happen  1) I crashed to desktop when
I would try to scroll  2) I could not scroll in chat window though
it did not crash out.  You may say "just don't scroll" but after
years of learned behavior it isn't so easy to stop and every time a
person forgets can mean a crash.

I am working on the sound problems I have had since the XP disaster
(as I have come to call it).
