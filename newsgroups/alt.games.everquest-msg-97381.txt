From the current newsletter that I just got in my email ....

"The moon that is visible from all over Norrath has a name too - It's called
Drinal. (Luclin is a hidden moon and can only be seen from a couple

So unless you want to get into a bunch of conspiracy theory, get over it,
move on, and find better things to do with what seems to be too much time on
your hands :p
