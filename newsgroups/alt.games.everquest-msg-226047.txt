Actually if you could visualise how much data there is to propogate
all the newsgroups an ISP has, you would be surprised.  For example,
just take a look in alt.binaries. <insert one of your choice> these
groups are adding gigabites by the minute sometimes.

You might feel its a crappy network. Why dont you start a news server
up and tell it to real time propogate all the newsgroups, you might
want to revamp that thought.
