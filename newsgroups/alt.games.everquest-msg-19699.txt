Actually, unless I'm mistaken, that name fits in with
the rules. What's so "fucking stupid" about it? ***Or are you one of
those testosterone hounds that loathes any hint of cuteness?***

--- At the risk of starting a flame war, I just wanted to comment on Dark
Tyger's
comments above.  I alternately respect / am puzzled by Dark Tyger's constant
rebuttal
of people's comments on this board.  Yes, he tries to keep the discussions
"enlightened"
while someone makes blanket statements that are usually negative, but such a
M.O. strikes me
as being close to one of Orwell's Thought Police.  Does every negative
comment someone makes
have to be analyzed in such a way?

***Just my opinion*** of course, and according to DT's own arguments I am
entitled to make it.
Again this is not meant to stir things up, just my own opinion and
puzzlement...

Thanks for your time.
