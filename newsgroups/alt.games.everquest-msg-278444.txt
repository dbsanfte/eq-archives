Not true.  First off, if you accept one and then cancel it and
ask again, you may well get offered different tasks.

More important, though, is that looking at the task usually only
tells you the first 1-2 steps.  More than once, I've had a task
where the first steps looked reasonable (e.g., kill some mobs in
DL and loot certain items) and then later steps were much more
daunting (explore a courtyard in Karnors), especially since tasks
are supposed to be soloable.

I had that Karnors task blocking my task window for weeks before
I happened to find a group willing to go there.  Nearly dropped it
in order to be able to accept DoN tasks, but managed to get it
finished.
