Sorry probably wasn't clear.
I ment more of a fun event where those who are higher level could chew
through mobs, while a bunch of lower levels milled about doing daft
stuff (like MT chanters etc.)
Just a sort of virtual picnic for age, with a little mob bashing thrown
in for fun.

I know that quite a few people here have chars on FV so I thought that
that would be an interesting place to do it.

Just an idea,

jim
