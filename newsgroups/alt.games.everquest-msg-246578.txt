Here's the deal:

For all the tradeskills except for fletching and smithing, skillups will
be computed/based on whichever is higher, your wisdom or intelligence.
In the case of fletching, the stats that will be looked at are wisdom,
intelligence OR dexterity. For smithing, the stats that will be looked
at are wisdom, intelligence OR strength. So, yes, if, with your dex
boosting gear, your dexterity is significantly higher than your wisdom
or intelligence, you will see the difference. But, in any other trade-
skill, your dex will count for nothing.
