I have had aggro as a beastlord healing my pet without having any active DOT
or slow on the enemy mob before. I don't know if this was a fluke but it's
happened more than once to me. Maybe the situation is different when the pet
is yours as in your example the cleric is healing the mage's pet and this
may not generate aggro wheras ( potentially ) a beastlord healing his / her
own pet may generate aggro. Any other Beastlords have similar / opposing
experiences?
