Must be the aging of the servers.  Everybody is rich enough where they don't
need to run the quest for money anymore.
On Firiona Vie a few months ago, when everyone was scrounging for coppers,
the chanters that could run the quest must have raked in the dough selling
those to everyone for 125pp.

For 10int and a greater lightsource, you betcha!  For any other item, you'd
pay quite a bit more than 200pp, that's true.
