    It does. I imagine the damage from falling is partly computed by "time
in the air", and lag would add to that number.

    Do you think part of it is speed? As in, drop off the edge of the ledge
and take X, run off the edge of the ledge and take X+Y? Wondering if the
damage computation somehow involves total distance travelled in the air, as
opposed to just vertical distance fallen.
