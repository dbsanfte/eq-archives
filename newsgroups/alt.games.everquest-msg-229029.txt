Hi Splendid;

Thanks for your time and thought on this.  You're right about pure meleeing,
I don't think my stamina bar even moved off of full. I guess my real concern
was using my EB ring. When under water or swimming a lot the stamina bar
slowly went down and if I got busy fighting or got lost while swimming I had
to keep casting something that would replenish the stamina.

I have not logged in yet since the patch to try out the EB ring to see what
happens. I would guess that the spell Extinguish Fatigue wont work anymore.

As to Ultra Vision. Then if I did cast Extinguish Fatigue or Yaulp V to try
to regen stamina, I would then have Ultra Vision for awhile??

Take Care
