The FV to BB boat does not actually go to BB, any
more than the OT Oasis boat goes to Oasis.  The
FV boat never stops at any port but FV, in fact, it
just pauses for barges.  One of these goes out to
the elven outpost, the second goes to the zone to BB.

If you want to go FV to FP, you can jump off the boat
at the closest approach, or take the barge to the outpost
and swim from there.  Either way, you are headed for
the ogre outpost where the barge to Oasis will stop.

Better than that, though, is the advanced method:
get levitate (the spell, mage ring, DMF, bard song...)
and someone with Tracking; head for the combine
towers over in the SE corner of the zone.  Check
tracking for the sea monster, and if he's not there,
dive in, at the bottom, between the towers, is a
hole down to the firepots room, where you can
breath, and select a port that leads directly to freeport...
or any of twelve other cities in the world.

This method is so good that its actually a shorter
way to reach most places in the world from near
freeport, BB, OT, or FV than anything short of a
druid or wizzard... shorter than either to Halas!
