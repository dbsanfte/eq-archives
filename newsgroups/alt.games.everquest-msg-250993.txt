	The problem with the SWG approach is it meant the devs could treat 
profession/class issues as low priority.  "If you don't like it, just respec!" 
  That in turn is a problem for anyone who identifies with a particular 
archetype (e.g. I like playing Rangers and wasn't interested in non-Ranger 
professions).  Additionally, treating character abilities as ephemeral means 
you can't use your abilities a defining point for the character.  That's a 
small problem for roleplayers and a big one for everyone else (the other 95% 
of your player base.)

	Respec needs to be available but not trivial.  I'm concerned that CoH's 
approach may be too Not Trivial, but we'll have to wait and see.
