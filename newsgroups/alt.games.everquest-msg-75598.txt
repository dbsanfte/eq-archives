They are talking about hotkeys I assume. As another poster says you
can make the /auction as long as you can by typing it yourself
manually as it lets you. The problem is that if you make a hotkey and
do this:

blah blah blah blah, blah
blah blah blah blah 500 plat

When you use the hotkey everyone else will only see:

blah blah blah blah, blah

There is no way to fix that, so what people do is type out long
auctions then use shift page up to continually repeat them. You just
have to be careful to repeat them again before your buffer gets full
from answering people's questions.

The only other choice you have is having more than one auction hotkey
but then it will look like this:

Fred auctions blah blah blah blah, blah
Fred auctions blah blah blah blah 500 plat

instead of your preferred:

Fred auctions blah blah blah blah, blah
blah blah blah blah 500 plat

This is probably one of the oldest things that players have wanted
verant to change. Perhaps when they do the actual interface upgrade
they were supposed to with Luclin they'll change it since they have to
rebuild it anyway. Hmm come to think of it I'll request that to the
developers corner now....
