I did a lot of kiting with my shaman, until I finally switched over to root
and rot.  If you run out of range, then start chain casting your DD until it
goes off, you can generally nuke and run without getting hit.  Root and rot
is definately more mana efficient, and with the right targets, can be done
continuously.  I never nuke when I am root and rotting, unless I get an add,
and have to kill the mob fast.
