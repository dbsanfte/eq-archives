:level is extremely important, but cha is also extremely important, and even
:more so for charming.  beyond mezzing, ae stunning, and probably even
:debuffing, cha is the single most important stat for any enchanter.  If you
:neglect it as an enchanter, you probably will have to expend much more mana
:and get beat about the head and shoulders longer, making it tougher on your
:friendly healer(s).  In places where you cannot mezz, charming on the first
:try is critical, and if it doesn't take or is resisted too soon will
:ultimately spell disaster.  I'm not sure how seriously important cha is for
:druids, I'd suggest getting some minor cha gear if you use charm alot, but
:for enchanters, whether you use charm, you need CHA.

And will a cha boost make the Charm spells last longer or increase chances
of it landing? Or both?
