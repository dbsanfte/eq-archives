I'll give you the polite version of what they are trying to tell you,
depending on what you mean by "high level game".

If you are talking about Sleepers Tomb and ToVN (lower end of the "high
end game") on up to the Emporer, VT, etc.  then sadly you are out of
luck. But before you go feeling bad, you're in the same boat with
roughly 90% of the players in the game. (Maybe slightly more or less). 
Only the very top end guilds who work forever and a day get to the point
that they can handle the content. Hell, they're also generally the only
ones with the free time to sit endlessly and work through the massive
time sinks VI requires to even enter some of them.

If you can't put in the time to play at that level, then they really
have no need for you and your odds of getting into such a guild are
pretty much nill.

But do you really want to? It comes with a price. You sound like more of
a "casual player" to me and probably enjoy the part of the game you do
experience with friends, etc.  Do you want to be required to show up
nearly every moment of free time you have to go on raids for hours on
end? (sometimes DAYS)?

Now if you think of "high end content" as something less than that (the
planes, not PoP, but the existing planes, HoT, DN, Deep in the Hole,
etc.) then there are probably a lot of third and fourth tier guilds on
any server that accomodate more of a "family guild" environment and can
make room for the casual player if you are competent and a nice person.

Good luck to ya.
