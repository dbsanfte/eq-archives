Erm firewall issues at all? You havent added one in between and its
crashing out with the new patches that the month break introduce?

Zone alarm does that reasonably often with me so I often have to start
after a patch with ZA off and then activate it while in windowed mode to
get it to accept the new patch exe - if I don't it crashes.
