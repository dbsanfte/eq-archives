Well, for PLing, I vote for chanters.  Haste, Clarity (if applicable), a 
damage shield (although not huge) and  most importantly, berz strength and 
rune.  who needs to heal if you ain't getting hurt?

On top of that, slowed mobs and mezzed adds don't hurt if the stuff hits 
the fan. :)  But then, I'm obviously biased.
