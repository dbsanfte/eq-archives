    I don't doubt it. Could YOU list for me every possible thing a player
could do to get around a difficult encounter? Could you even list a number
of  "exploit guidelines" that would catch everything players can and would
do? Then, having MADE that list, do you doubt that for every instance of
exploiting someone will try to use rules lawyering to squirm out of it?
Hell, one person in the thread was using the dictionary having dual meanings
for "exploit" to try and explain away those quotes in the VI response.

    Sounds like every sports league with referees on the planet. ;-)

    They tell you what should be dropping, you say "No it shouldn't." How
can anyone argue with that? If you meant to say "Warders, given the
difficulty of the encounter, really shouldn't drop cloth caps, as it's a
slap in the face to those who defeat them," then we have something.

    This sounds like you have info I don't. How did they know? Who knew?
Where was it posted? When did VI comment on it? And, given the response
letter on the Dev Board, does the Res and Snare look like it was the reason
they got suspended?

    The battle cry of the exploiter. ;-) VI, through the rules of play, has
limited what "tactics" you can use.

    Question, not entirely related to the above but it's something that's
been rattling around in my head: did it ever occur to any guild to, if they
didn't know whether something was an exploit or not, simply call a GM and
ask for a ruling? To ASK if what they were doing was an exploit? Or do they
all just do what they think of and hope it isn't? I mean, I have no idea if
VI wanted you to figure out what stacked against the Silence spell and then
apply it to dispel silence. Did anyone using this method think to ASK a GM
if it was OK, if they were the least bit uncertain?

    I thought of the same thing when Phara Dar's was first reported
erroneously to have a mez-effect breath weapon: "Cool, I bet if everyone
duels and gets a weak DoT put on them, it'll keep the mez from sticking
long!"
