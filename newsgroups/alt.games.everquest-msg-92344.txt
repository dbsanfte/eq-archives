Well, if you got a little cash, East Commons is THE place to be on most
servers. It's where auctioning is taking place. On some servers it's Greater
Faydark. Ask around.
If you got NO cash, I can't really recommend any particular zone for newbie
mage drops. But I'm sure that if you do some /shouts or /ooc's in some
zones, some aspiring tailor will prolly whip up some free armor for you.
