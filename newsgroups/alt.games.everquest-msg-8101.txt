not exactly , the dmg/dly is little more compex.

since you get dmg bonuses at higher lvl, hitting more oftem  means more dmg

for example if there was no dmg bonus you or cripling/critical hits. you
might get  with fast weapon
20
20
20
20  == 80

with slower with more dmg
30
30
30 == 90

so it seems that the more dmg slower is better how ever with dmg bonus of
say 10 you get
30
30
30
30  == 120

vs

40
40
40 == 120

Now since you hitting more often with the fast weapon for you have more
chances for procs and critical hits and each miss cost you less dmg lose
from your potential
