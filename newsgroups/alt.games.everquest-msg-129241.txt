Really the only thing you can do short of an AOE Mezz is to /assist the
tank, then f8 and hope it switches to the other one. If it doesn't run your
ass around until it does. Looking for the difference in mob health is the
key. Or tell the tank to move off to the side and hope they seperate a bit.
The mob might latch onto someone else for a second, but since you are gonna
mezz it right away, that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

I think this could all be solved if EQ would make a better indicator for
targeting. It might hurt immersion a bit, but I think a bright yellow/red
ring at the mobs feet would be nice. Certainly easier to judge then the
blinky names we have now.
