That is a simple explanation.  When you resurrect a body, YOU arent
actually doing the resurrection so much as you are communing with your
diety and praying that he/she will restore life to this body as you
deem the life worthy.  You are a Paladin, one who is tied very tightly
to thier diety, just as a Cleric is so bound.  The result is that
restoration of life is something that is simply in your realm just as
doing that what is Just and Right is.

Tis not a simple matter of being smart enough to cast certain high
level magics but not smart enough to figure out how to cast lower
ones.
