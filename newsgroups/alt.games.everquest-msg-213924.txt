Druid/Ranger snare (4 minutes) Mana: 15
Druid/Ranger ensnare (14 minutes) Mana: 35

Necro/SK Engulfing Darkness (lasts a whole minute) Mana: 60
Necro/SK Dooming Darkness (first one that lasts 1:30 or more) Mana:
120

If the 35 mana ensnare takes too much mana, then the Druid or Ranger
can pull out good old snare and use only 15 mana, and still have his
snare last more than twice as long as any necro snare that I know of.
