No idea, to tell the truth after reading some of the replies from him I
would rather Baroness Safana trained his whining arse at every opportunity.
My argument was more about whether there should have been a train there in
the first place, if it was caused by said Baroness.
Hypothetically, if a 55th level character pulled a train in a low level
dungeon where mobs will not aggro him/her (remember how piss easy the HS
room is to clear at 30?) then decided to pull that train to zone, I'd be
less than impressed with their behaviour.
On the other side, there are countless different scenarios that could have
caused such behaviour and may not have anything to do with just been lazy
and inconsiderate.

Subject dropped, we will just have to agree the OP is a fuckwit.
