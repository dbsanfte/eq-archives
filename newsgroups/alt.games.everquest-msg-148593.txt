    High-level rangers with the full selection of AA skills are beasts in
duels. They can pump out a ton of melee-style damage (arrows) to anything
that's within range to hurt them back, pretty much. And if a caster stops
moving to cast a spell on the ranger, the ranger's damage output doubles.
Melees that try and close on a ranger quickly find themselves being
bow-kited. Nasty stuff.
