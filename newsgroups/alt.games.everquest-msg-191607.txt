That's pretty much the take I had on it. I got a CD in a magazine I
purchased about 2 years ago. It was widely distributed that way here
in the US but never really caught on. I did see a news blurb about the
game spilling over to gang violence in Korea but I cannot remember the
source. That was pretty much the take I had on the game back then....
cyber-gang warfare.

In function it is very much like a Diablo style combat system as I
remember, but I am going on memory of about 5 playing sessions, two
years ago. Basically it didn;t hold enough interest for me to keep it.
