Greetings all:

I've been trying to wean my character off of bought food through the
use of foraging.  Yesterday, while foraging I had the following odd
occurrence twice:  I was given the message that I had found some water,
but the water failed to appear under my mouse pointer or in my
inventory!  I always keep 3 inventory slots open, just in case; if an
item doesn't fit into a bag I'm carrying, I usually use one of these
emergency spots then hoof it to town.  Totally baffled as to what
happened, and now I'm just a little nervous about attempting to pick up
other items.  Just wondering if anyone else has had a similar
occurrence?
