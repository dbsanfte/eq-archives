Check out the enchanter creation guide at 
http://eq.castersrealm.com/creationguides/enchanter.asp - complete with 
suggested stat allocations. My own advice would be to max out INT at all 
costs. CHA is easy to raise with jewellery (its very cheap, has high stat 
bonuses compared to similar INT gear, and cats eye agate stuff trivials low 
so you can even make it yourself early on), also you get a line of CHA 
buffs eventually. It will be much easier for you to get your CHA up to 
something respectable than you INT. Apart from that, Erudites have more 
INT+CHA than High Elves, but they also fall below the 75 cutoff for sucky 
agility, so will have a much poorer AC unless you stick some points in AGI. 
Dark Elves get racial hide, which you can use to deliberately break charms 
rather than have to mem and cast invis. Any of those 3 races are a good 
choice.

Always choose agnostic as an enchanter, otherwise your illusion line of 
spells will be majorly broken. No point fooling everyone in Neriak into 
thinking you're a dark elf if you then prance about harping on about the 
love of Tunare - they'll still kill you.
