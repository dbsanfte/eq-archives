I meant to remark in my earlier reply to your reply: your explanation
is spot on (though I don't have to like what it means with regard to
how little benefit I get from the focus item!).  If the item adds a
random amount from 1-20%, rounding down, then 1-7% would be no effect
(up to +0.91), 8-15% would be +1 damage, and 16-20% would be +2 damage.
That's 35%, 40%, and 25% of the cases, which is pretty close to how
they turned out.
