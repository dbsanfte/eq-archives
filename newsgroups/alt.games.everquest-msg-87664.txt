Any group that wants to be self reliant at decent levels (20+) would need to
include a Cleric and Enchanter. Another nice thing for higher levels would
be a porter, so 3rd slot can be either a druid or wiz... I'd go druid for
sow and heals. Last spot would have to be a tank... and I'd have to say
warrior. Mainly because warriors have only one problem... they can't cast
spells. Since you have a cleric enchanter and druid following them
everywhere, this isn't an issue. SK or paladin would work ok in this role
also though not as well.

So my suggestions would be Cleric Druid Enchanter Warrior. If you decide you
don't need an enchanter, you could swap him out for any other class, I'd
suggest another melee.
