I do technical support and I often see comments in customers' accounts with
bad spelling (mostly from our billing department...which explains why
people's bills are so screwed up at times).

Changed settings from YES to KNOW (no?)
Ordered THREW (through?) the phone system
DUE (do?) not give credit
..."been all over the homeowner's ass. about it" (supposed to have been
abbreviation for "association".)

I believe there have been others I'm just not thinking of at the moment.

I'm just waiting on someone to get lazy and use a certain 3 letter spelling
for the word "come".
