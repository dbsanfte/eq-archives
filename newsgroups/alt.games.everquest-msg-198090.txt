Not merchants per se.  Rogues can pick pocket from mobs, if successful, it 
can net some cash and/or an item.  It will only yield something that the 
mob has on it already, it does not spontaneously generate extra items.  It 
will not allow you to pickpocket something that a merchant has for sale.  
It will not work on many items (anymore).  For example, you could not walk 
up to Sev and pickpocket the greenscale.  If the pickpocket skill check 
fails, it will (may?) cause the mob to agro.  In fact, there are several 
items that need to be pickpocketed in order to complete the rogue epic 
weapon.  It is frowned upon in a group situation if used to take more than 
your share of the loot.
