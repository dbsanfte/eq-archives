Why are you "worried" about being inspected?

Afraid that their long hard stares of jealousy might wear your equipment
out?

I have never seen a problem with being inspected or inspecting people
without asking.

The message can be annoying but I think if you are being inspected to the
point where its frustrating then you must look like you have some uber gear.
Maybe they will make this into an option. Wonder why its there in the first
place?
