    If I was motivated enough, I'd post the link to the FoH boards. What
motivated this nonsense is a few warriors in the PoP Beta complained they
couldn't get groups in one of the PoP zones which is almost entirely undead,
because paladins were good enough tankers and did more damage than they did.
Glad to see they "put a lot of thought into the issue".

    Oh, and the mobs won't lose their flag. Paladins just won't have Slay
Undead scale up in damage past level 60, which was smart in any event. Level
65 paladins would have been able to crit for 10 K otherwise.
