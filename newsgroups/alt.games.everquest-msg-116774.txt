Er.. 72 minutes I think, not checked recently but around that.

Anyway my point was the other Monk said no Ranger would *ever*
outdamage him on any uber mob, this is clearly not the case.  Even
*without* Trueshot Rangers can outdamage Rogues in certain conditions
(see many whining posts on the Safehouse).  Helps HUGELY on high AC
mobs that Rangers can get over 1500 ATK without the help of a Bard.

Hrmm, I somewhat doubt that 100 ATK is anywhere near a 30% DPS
increase.  As far as I can make out (proper logs seem to be hidden in
the secret area of the Safehouse) uber Rogues using substantially
better than Primal weapons top out around 160 DPS on normal xp mobs
without using discs but with VoG and as such so 200 DPS seems very
high indeed.  Can you point out something on Monkly Business or
anywhere where a log is posted for similar levels of DPS?  Without
discs obviously.

No, for Rangers *EVERY* arrow will hit for double damage providing the
mob isn't rooted, Trueshot just pumps up the average damage over 2
minutes.  Criticals are nice and showy but it's the average damage
that makes the difference.  With a 250 range Bow and 150 range arrows
(or 100 range even) he's outside the AoE Fear range.

Another of your points I forgot to correct from an earlier post - Dark
Cloak of Sky was inventory only for ONE patch (a week later they
changed it back) - every Ranger I know has it bound to his kick
hotkey.
