Unless this has been fixed in the past couple month, there's a problem in
pathing that puts the general under the ice floes between the tower island and
the pirate island.  One of his waypoints is on TOP of one of the floes, and he
can't get there from underneath without your help.

What we did, after some experimenting, was to aggro him, have him chase the
victim up onto the floe, then mem blur or atone him once he's up there, then he
will head for his waypoint again, and if he doesn't fall off the floe he'll hit
his mark and move on to the pirates.

This happened to us at least three times doing this quest, we always made it
work eventually, but it could take three or four tries to get it right even
when we knew just what to do.  Fortunately, there's no combat involved, so its
just a chore.

If, though, as one of the other posters suggests, mem blurring the general now
pops him back to his start position, this would be a real nightmare.  Perhaps
there's some other solution, or perhaps (as IF) its been fixed so he doesn't
path under there in the first place...
