Random items would be nice (ala d2). I cant see that writing a random item
generator for eq would be particularly hard. Ive done it myself in c++ for
d&d.
I also think there should be some places that these items can be bought.
Someone out there has to be making these items, as well as the fact that
these good items are being sold to the vendors constantly. Where do they all
go?

It woulnt worry me if the items wern't recycled item for item (that would be
nice tho), but just some random items in the store to simulate it would be
good enough for me.
