But there was no reason to expect that a situation remotely like this
was coming.  Every other game most people have seen has continued to
work, long after the OS and hardware has become hopelessly outdated.
The usual situation is that *NEW* stuff becomes less likely to work on
your system, and so over time, you find you have to upgrade in order
to be able to play new stuff.

Here, you could be playing the game you've played on Win95 for two
years, and log out one night, and the next morning, you find that you
now have to get a new OS to play.  I don't recall that ever happening
before.
