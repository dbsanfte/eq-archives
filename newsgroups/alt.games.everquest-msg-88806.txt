I think Feral Cave Kodiaks in GD would be good at 40 - since I really quad'd
them for all they're worth up to about 44.

At the end when they were mostly light blue - besides the still blue
'ferocious' variety at 44 - I got to where I'd regen and DS up, camo myself,
then run right into the southmost cave, running past several other lesser
kods right up to the ferocious or savage that always spawned - slapped them
in the head and ran out gathering up the others in aggro on the way.

And you're quite right, with 4 cave kodiaks blazing down on you, hitting in
the 90's each - it can be a rush and it certainly demands an almost flawless
connection.

Be careful of the mighty quad though - at 52 I'm finding that it's a like a
cold shower not being able to find the readily available quad mobs I was
doing in the 40's and you really do get used to that full blue or more per
4x kill.
