Actually Paladins get a 90% rez.  On the other hand Clerics can
outdamage Paladins (I can accept this, as I cannot change it, but
I will never understand it).  With cultural smithing and PoP most
any tank or wannabe tank will be able to top 5.5khp when "raid
buffed", which is high enough to make CHeal better than [whatever-
the-hell-they-call-incomplete-heal] (I'm not a raider, and I'm
only L54 and my hp already top 4.2k with Aego/Brells/[ShamanBuff],
and so far I have only one piece of cultural plate).  CLerics are
still by a very substantial margin the best healers, beyond CHeal
they've got excellent HoTs (unique spell line!) and a variety of
fast-casting and/or long-range heals.  Clerics are neither nerfed
nor obsolete.  And besides, they're useful in those evil AE groups
unlike the overwhelming majority of classes.
