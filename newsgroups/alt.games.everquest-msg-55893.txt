Give it up and train in the east freeport sewer instead. Go in to the
left of the guards, facing freeport (through invis wall by the tent)
Follow the right wall around to the right and down then go straight
and you see xelha in red. If your faction is glower or something you
can't train yet but give her stacks of 4 bone chips until you can.

Further past zelha are some more merchants and if you go in a door
there to the left, there is a barbarian guy in there who is a warrior
trainer.

The best part about this is you don't have to zone through all the
zones you do in neriak or duck all the time (stupid short inkies!)
You'll save a ton of time and its far easier just taking the tunnel
from east commons to nro then going into east freeport and down in the
sewer. 

Its too late for you to realize the best part of the quest at 23 which
is fantastic bone chips. I ran my ogre warrior there at level 2 or so.
