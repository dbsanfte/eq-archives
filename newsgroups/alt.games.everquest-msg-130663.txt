> No better?  No better than what?  Constructs like that are meaningless.

You are no better than the person who wants to spout racist guff on a
newsgroup.  You are being just as selfish as they are by wanting it off your

No, the newsgroups that Cox chooses to carry doesnt reflect on the users of
the ISP at all.  That is absurd.

provides.
