Oh, hell yeah...

I've gotten support calls from lots of clients who ask me
what to do at a particular juncture, and I keep struggling
for polite ways to say, "well, as the box you're staring
at explains to you quite plainly..."

Similarly, I've discovered that newbie computer users
almost universally stare at the keyboard looking for
a clue what to do next, instead of reading the prompts
on the screen.
