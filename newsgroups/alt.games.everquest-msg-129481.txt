Alright, ignore the main point why don't you?

Last I heard, there were still *some* Indians left over there in
the US, though I don't think "genocide" is too strong a word
for some of the things that happened.

But your whole premise is faulty - why should the fact that
the ancestors of Americans have done nasty things to the
Indians mean that it's okay for the Israelis to do nasty
things to the Palestinians?  That just makes no sense at
all.

"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter".  Do you
agree or disagree with this statement?
