Headed down to Icefang camp, ghost was up, I tried to get some help 
together, enchanter managed to find a Death Squad (someone else turned 
out to be doing the shawl quest and had spawned them and trained them, 
chanter wasn't quite as crazy as I thought) and by the time that fuss 
had settled down the ghost was gone.

I'm not sure if a DS member got him or if he despawned.

At any rate, chanter logged for dinner and I made friends with a 65 
cleric and 65 beastlord who were in zone hunting eggs; chatted with them 
about the quest details and so on, and killed lots of PH for em.  They 
were wary about doing the quest with me but willing... but finally we 
all decided to skip it since it was late and the 9pm game time didn't 
seem to be coming around very fast; they got their last egg and we all 
logged.

This morning, I read up on the quest a bit and decided to give it a go solo.

Ghost was up, got him started, he started up the dog, who ran off... 
faster than normal run but not as fast as SOW potion speed, he was easy 
to keep up with.  He didn't aggro anything at all whole trip, and 
neither did I till the end; stumbled across a snow giffin (There were 
tons of em up, I suspect cause of the Snow X slaughter that went on the 
night before), so I had to take it out, which put the wolf into the 
Poxbreath camp.  Ah well, I pulled Poxbreath along with a couple of his 
buddies and ran towards the Garadain camp.

When I got close I tried to snare Poxbreath and got out of range; funny, 
you'd think a SOW speed mob would be right behind me.  But no, I'd lost 
him.  Ran back towards the spawn and managed to find him, all alone.  So 
I killed him, which wasn't difficult to do.  Looted up, headed back to 
garadain, and ran into one of his buddies.  Killed him too, and then to 
Garadain.

Handed in ring and drop and the head of Rodrick (which I've had since my 
40s, cause he pops right outside CC exit and I've killed him many times 
when done with the Geonid camp) and got ring 6
