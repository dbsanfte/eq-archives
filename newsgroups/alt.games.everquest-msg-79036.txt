512 of Ram and a Geforce 2 card more than cut my initial load time in half
and seems to have had zone effect on zoning times as well, but not as much.
Basically, using a 56k modem the Geforce 2 took me from 7.5 minutes initial
loading time to about 2.5 minutes which is better than it had been prior to
SOL so apparently video cards do make a difference.
