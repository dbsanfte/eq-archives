Umm are you certain ? If this happened exactly the way you describe
(intruder shot and killed wife) I feel confident that anyone who
passed the bar specializing in criminal defense would at least be able
(in the states, canada has no temp insanity) Get temporary insanity
successfully argued and barring that then definately manslaughter
would be the strongest any self respecting jury should come back with
and even then the judge should take into consideration the likelyhood
of the person to re-offend. Of course there is a statute of
limitations on how long one can be temporarily insane.. shooting them
outside the court house before the trial starts or after they get off
is likely a bad idea.
