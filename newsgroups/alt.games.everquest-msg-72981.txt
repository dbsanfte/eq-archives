Ouch, yeah.  The current CPU is a problem but won't be after you upgrade.
The RAM, though, is really on the low side.  XP takes a minimum 110MB off
the top.  EQ wants (I believe) oh, about 550 more. :p

Is AWE64 older than Live?  If so your sound is probably ok.  If not you may
get stuttering problems.  There's a few fixes out but nothing guaranteed
until Creative, Microsoft and Verant get their acts together.
