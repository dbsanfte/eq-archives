No, theres no faction for killing animals in Qeynos hills, although
there are roaming NPCs who will object if they catch you doing it.

There is a faction hit for killing animals inside Surefall glade
however.

The original poster was probably aggroed by an animal who couldn't care
less about druids, like a puma or something.

My druid is a tailor who has killed hundreds of animals of all
descriptions, and bears and wolves are still amiable to me.
