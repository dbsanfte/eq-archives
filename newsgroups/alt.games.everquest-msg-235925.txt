Glad to hear about the no transfer rule for Stromm - Ii only came to it
recently because of all the trouble with 1017 and 1001 errors, plus zone
crashes recently on my main [ only - 3 months in game ] server, Tunare.

When lots of servers are down, Stromm seems to consistently work reliably,
in my experience...
