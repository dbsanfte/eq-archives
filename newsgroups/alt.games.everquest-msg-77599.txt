I decided to take my young, semi-twinked (I prefer to call it "financially
augmented") 1/2 Elf Ranger to Rivervale in order to get bound. While lagging
around town I hear someone  shouting about the Squad Ring. Seems the
pot-bellied runts in the warrior guild are concerned about goblins and
actually have a pretty cool little quest that requires no foraged items, no
cross-continent runs, or 8-hour spawn camps. This Squad Ring is freely given
once you reach a certain level  of friendliness with the Guardians of the
Vale..

So I set out to raise my faction. I killed a number of Bixies, Orc Pawns,
Orc Centurions, and goblins without number.

Actually, I do have the numbers:

Stone Hive Bixies: 70
Death Fist Orcs: 84
Runnyeye Goblins: 576 (didn't personally kill them all, but did assist.)

And then I turned in 340 Runnyeye Warbeads. It took me two long days of
playing, and I made 3 complete levels.

That is the good news.

The bad news is that the Squad Ring is a single-charge ring with no AC or
other stats. The spell? Healing. I guess it may come in handy in an
emergency. *sigh*

Oh, and once I recieved the ring, I took a faction hit. I have to kill about
3/4 as many goblins to get another, or get it recharged.
