Some nights, my BL just likes to wander the hills, stop at a lake, and fish.
There's a lot of beauty in Norrath that sometimes goes unappreciated. No,
he's not leveling that way, but I'm having my kind of relaxing my way. Other
times, he'll help others across an unfamiliar or dangerous zone. Sometimes
he'll just hunt pelts to make items. And sometimes he'll solo or group to
fight the unjustice on Norrath. He's there to meet my mood, not mine to his.
