Are you sure about that?  I was helping my guild camp the Fennin Ro
trigger last week and we just kept pulling the mobs around the area.  I
was set as a group leader and finally was able to get some leadership
exp.  By the time it was over in a course of about 10-11 hours I had
gained over just enough to get an enhanced stat group ability (which I
picked HP) and hadn't finished an AA point.  I haven't been looking at
any class focus message boards, so I haven't seen the exp studies on
leadership and raid leadership exp yet.  XD
