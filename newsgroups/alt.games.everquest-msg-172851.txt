    After I once nearly had to zone from that dark elf in WC, at level 60
(nuke, resist, nuke, resist, nuke, WTF?!?), I never underestimate greens.

    Depends on what prices are like in your Bazaar for spiderling silks and
low/medium/high quality pelts. Making paddings is pretty quick and painless,
and doesn't really take much tailoring skill. You can see similar pricing on
other tradeskill intermediate products. For example, I see small pieces of
acrylia at less than 50 pp each, but acrylia studs (require 3 small pieces
per stud, net) are never lower than 175 pp each. Making my own studs is
always more cost effective, and doesn't take very long.

    That is fortunate. The only people that seem to get into price wars on
my server are end product providers - the raw materials are snapped up too
quickly for price wars to develop.

    Hmm, odd. I have a 15% modifying item, and I can confirm that I could
make a 220-skill restricted item (ethereal silk swatches) at 192. I know
because I tried at 191, hoping the modified skill was rounded, and then when
that failed I came back at 192.

    So do I, and off vendors they're something like 2.7 pp each. There's a
vendor with infinite supply in PoK, located right near a celestial solvent
vendor.

    How expensive is an attempt for Heraldic? Use a two-sheet item as the
average. I'm curious as to how much margin there is on it - I assume plenty.

    I'm waiting for prices to settle down a little bit more on the 63-64
spells. Of course by that point I may very well have all my spells from the
guild. ;-)

    Look at the skill chart on EQTraders. I think it's something like bowls
or jars to 120-ish, then switch to casserole dishes in Jaggedpine. You have
to bring your own stuff to make ceramic linings on-site, but other than that
it's fairly quick.
