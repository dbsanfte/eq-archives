First off, don't sweat DX9 "compatibility". All major card makers will
produce DX9 drivers for all of their cards. Even the ones that do not
support DX9 in hardware. The difference will be that the non-DX9 cards
will lack some features compared to fully compatible cards. 

By the time games come out that take full advantage of DX9 features,
the card you buy today will be obsolete. Trust me. It happend with
T&L, and it happend with DX8. Everybody who ran out and bought
compatible cards early wasted their money. By the time the features
were being used in games, the cards were too slow to take full
advantage of them. No publisher with half a brain will put out a game
the requires a DX9 card to run for at least another year. Some games
may look a little better with a DX9 card (if they are coded with DX9
features), but that is about it.

I would recommend sticking with the Ti4200 for now. It's the best bang
for your buck. Save your money, and then buy a fully compatible DX9
card when the next generation of cards hit the street (which will most
likely be around Xmas or a little later) if you feel compelled to
upgrade.

I currently have a 128mb GF4Ti4200 and it plays every game I own
flawlessly.
