Hi all,

Tonight (22/6/02) and on the day they were patching the accounts sections I
have not been able to log any of my 3 computers into everquest.  The EQ
Patcher loads but i dont get the exp bar filling up and then an Illegal
Error Fault terminates things.

I cant find anywhere that says the servers are down.  I havent changed my
setup or installed any new programs and EQ ran well last night.

Is anyone else experiencing similar or is this due to servers being down
unannounced.  If so can anyone tell me where to look for information on
server outages - I have tried the Sony site. EQ stratics and EQ vault.

Thanks in advance,
Mark Wilson
