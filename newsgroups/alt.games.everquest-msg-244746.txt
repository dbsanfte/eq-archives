Reasonably sure. Even if he was right, though, and item info was
stored server side, the graphic is still client-side and still a part
of the item. Even without that, it doesn't change the fact that you
aren't given the right to sell the item for cash, as you never
actually own the item in the first place. The item is still a part of
their whole copyrighted work, and still protected under their
copyright.
