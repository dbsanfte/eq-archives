** New Plane of Hate **

The new Plane of Hate is now available on Stormhammer.  Enjoy!


** Mitigation Change **

We have evaluated the mitigation abilities of cloth and leather classes, and
have made changes as appropriate.  For the most part, this change is a
reasonable improvement to the ability of monks to absorb damage.  At some
point in the future we may re-examine the mitigation abilities of chain and
plate classes.  At this time, and with this final round of changes to cloth
and leather classes, we believe that something very close to the appropriate
balance is in place.


** Pathing Update **

The first part of our work to update the pathing system for EverQuest is
complete.  NPC and pet pathing should be much improved.


** Charm Changes **

- Healing a charmed pet now generates an appropriate amount of hate for the
healer.
- Charmed pets now take up to one third of the experience for each NPC
killed.  This amount scales down based on the percentage of damage to the
target that the pet does. Dire charm pets still take the same experience
they always have.
- Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's preferred target if
there are many players available for the monster to attack instead.


** Windowed Mode for the EverQuest front end **

This patch introduces the ability for players to enter windowed mode at the
EverQuest front end (from the time you log in until you get into the game).
With this addition, players will be able to run EverQuest in a window from
the moment they click on the EverQuest icon to the moment they log out.

In order to switch to windowed mode on the front end, just hit Alt-Enter.
Note that there are no settings in the eqclint.ini file for this, you just
have to hit Alt-Enter.

Use Alt-R to release the mouse from the EverQuest window (note that once in
the game, you need to use Alt-Shift-R to release the mouse).

And, obviously, Alt-Tab will switch between open programs.

We have also added a Tech button that will take you to our Tech Chat.  This
only works in windowed mode, as it opens up a new window to display the
chat.


** Spells **

- Stoicism now follows the same restrictions as Torpor.
- Trickster's Augmentation and Boon of the Garou can now be cast by
characters on horseback.
- Fixed a bug that was causing spells with levitation effects to lose
levitation if cast over a spell that also had a levitation effect.
- Bards now receive their first level song at creation.
- Changed the spelling of "Corpal Empathy" to "Corporeal Empathy".
- Changed the hit by message for Torrent of Fatigue recourse to "Your
vitality grows."
- Changed the wear off message for Song of Sustenance to "Your hunger
returns."
- Adjusted the shaman spell Disinfecting Aura to be in line with Pure Blood.
- The Necromancer line of heal-over-time spells should no longer overwrite
Transon's Phantasmal Protection.
- Augment now overwrites Augmentation.
- Brell's Stalwart Shield now has a casting time of 4 seconds.
- Spiritual Vigor now has a casting time of 5 seconds.
- Resurrection no longer gives the "Your strength returns" message two times
when the negative effects wear off.
- Fixed a bug that would cause other players to see a character with default
face/hair for their race when they turned off an illusion.
- Fixed bug that could cause beards to fail to reappear when an illusion
wears off.  This may also fix some other appearance bugs as well.


** Illusions/Shape Change **

We have changed the way that Illusions and Shape Changes work with respect
to faction.  The new system is a lot easier to understand than the old one,
so we'll just explain the new one.  When changed into the form of a playable
race, characters are treated as if they were a member of that race.  When
changed into a non-playable race, characters retain their own racial
factions.


** PvP **

- If a player is moving when using archery against a PvP target, they have a
reduced chance to hit their target.
- Archery in Player vs. Player combat in now reduced to 66% damage.
- Direct Damage spells in Player vs. Player combat can only do up to 75%
damage of the target's maximum hit points in a single hit.  This
modification is done before resists are taken into account.  For example, if
a player has 1000 hit points when fully healed, no single direct damage
spell will do more than 750 damage to him in a single hit.


** Alternate Advancement **

- Alternate Advancement abilities that grant Stamina gains should now update
the character's hit points automatically when trained.
- Dire Charm isno longer "used" when trying to affect an NPC under the power
of a Dictate spell.  It will not work, and the power is not expended.


** Interface **

- Using the "/book" command with no page argument now closes the spellbook
if it's already open.
- Added a "Dump" button to Guild Management window.  Pressing it creates a
text file in the EQ directory containing a comma-delimited text dump of the
Guild Management window.  The file name will be the guild name with _
instead of spaces, so a guild named "Legacy of Ykesha" would be a file
called Legacy_of_Ykesha.txt.
- Cross-server tells are now filtered under the "tells" filter like
same-server tells, and in the same colors.
- Music Player volume no longer decreases when zoning.
- The Journal window and Journal Categories window now close when hitting
Escape.
- The Map window no longer pops up after zoning if you used Escape to close
it in the previous zone.
- Hot button names are once again restricted to eight characters.  Being
able to make them longer was a bug, and was causing issues with displaying
more than eight characters.
- The scrollbar for the Notes window should now update properly when the
window is resized.
- Added multi-select capability to the Friends List, Music, Journal NPC,
Journal Text and Journal Category windows.  Shift-click selects groups of
items, Control-Click selects individual items.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the Journal window to lose all information
since the last save when logging was turned off.
- Confirmation Dialog window now remembers its position.
- The third person camera view #3 no longer resets when zoning or using the
armor tinting feature.
- Fixed an uncommon crash caused by the Music Player window.
- The LFG button in the Group window now toggles the LFG window.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the attack button from working properly when a
Centi Warspear was equipped.
- The dialog box for confirmation of a change in video modes now remains
open for 30 seconds instead of 15 seconds.
- Added a "Show Offline" button to the Guild Management window.  This
determines whether or not you want to show offline people in the window, and
the setting is remembered when you log out.
- If you sort by anything other than Name in the Guild Management window,
the window will sub-sort your list by name.
- Changed the promote button in the Guild Management window to only be
enabled when eligible guild member is targeted (not just selected in
window).
- Fixed a problem that caused a few people to have the spell particle
density revert to default off when they logged off.
-Fixed the Map window to remove a method of avoiding the map restrictions in
certain zones.
- Added /getguildmotd.  This command allows you to see your guild message of
the day at any time.
- /guildmotd now sets or clears the guild message of the day.  If used with
no text, it clears the existing message of the day.  Only leaders and
officers can use this command
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when pressing the U key while in
explore mode.
- When under the effects of invisibility, a character that hides and then
moves and breaks their hide also breaks their invisibility.  The
invisibility icon will now disappear under this circumstance so that the
player knows he is no longer invisible.
- Closing the AA window no longer causes the resurrection notification box
to disappear.
- Updated the category lists in the Bazaar window to be alphabetical.
- Characters will no longer be prevented from being a trader if you quickly
click on Begin/End Trader.
- Fixed a bug with the LFG tool that may have been causing some people to
crash when zoning.
- New colors should no longer be moving from the armor dye column to the
item tint column when a character is saved.
- Hand to hand weapons now "greys out" the melee attack button.
- For those that type quickly, typing %t1 now has the same effect as typing
%t 1.
- Fixed a bug that prevented you from purchasing a lore item if you have
just purchased that item and destroyed it.
- Setting loot split color now changes the text color when others loot and
autosplit, as well as when the player loots.
- Language skills now update in the skills window immediately, and the
message given upon skill up includes the name of the language improved.
- Default chat channels should now be saved properly.


** NPCs **

- Corrected an issue with trainers that sometimes caused them to kick a
character out of the game.
- Tin Soldiers no longer give stun immune messages to color flux when they
are already stunned.
- Sollari Bekines now asks for two vials of Gnoll blood instead of one.  She
has always wanted two for her quest.
- Corrected some text errors for Avir Sterbla.
- Fixed a spelling error in Paralin Notion's text.  "Other" now reads
"Others".
- Corrected a spelling error in the Stonefist Clansman's death text.

the world in Warsliks Woods.

event to appear in Eastern Wastes.

be drinking their own blood.

- Corrected a spelling error (changed "to" to "too") in Morgalanth

- Oracle Balek and Grave Lord Vizurik now speak the appropriate text.
- Coriante Verisue should no longer talk about Miragul all the time.
- Cobi Frostbeard should no longer refer to himself as "she".
- A ghoul in Neriak shouldn't be banging his head on a wall due to a pathing
error.  If he does it now, it's out of frustration about the way his Dark
Elven masters let stinky Trolls into their city.
- Corrected a spelling error in Elial Brook's text.
- Frist Furtun now accepts all Upheaval scrolls for his quest.
- The invisible, untargetable NPCs in the elemental planes that were
attacking people have been evicted.  Absor is now using them as avatars in
PlanetSide, and his scores have gone way up.
- Corrected a spelling error in the agro text of an Enthralled Underbulk
(changed "lungs" to "lunges").
- Corrected a grammatical error in the text of Animist Poren (added the word

** Items **

- Made Saltwater Seaweed stackable.
- Due to a drop table error, all existing instances of the Market Signet
have been changed to have no stats.  If you received one legitimately
through the quest, you can give the old item to Aid Grimel for a new one
with all the correct stats.  If you do not meet the requirements, Aid Grimel
will not reimburse you.
- Changed the spelling from Mythril to Mithril on Mithril Knuckles and
Mithril Edged Skull Splitter.
- Removed the ability to be used in the secondary slot from Club of the
Secretive.  This is a Cleric, Druid, Shaman only item.

Combine Acrylia Two Handed Sword.  These weapons are two-handed slash.

- Darksight Dagger is no longer listed as being equipable in the secondary
hand. It is a caster only item.

Four Winds, since they could not use the item.
- Sample Chest is no longer No Rent.
- Mushroom Bread now looks like bread in inventory rather than a bowl.
- Corrected the spelling of venomous on a few items.


** Miscellaneous **

- Modified checklist flags to make them a little easier to understand
(checklist flags are the flags that you obtain for doing PoP events out of
order that allow you to complete the final flag quest by gathering all the
checklist flags and talking to a Seer).  Now when you receive a checklist
flag you get a different message than the one that you get when you receive
a normal flag.  Ask the seer to unlock memories and she will tell you which
checklist flags you have.
- Corrected a problem that was causing PoP raid flag mobs to not give out
flags to anyone if the associated boss was killed by someone not in the raid
group.  Now if someone not in a raid gets the kill, only people not in a
raid can get flagged.  This means that people may have to leave a raid to
get flagged, but it means that raids should no longer miss flags if someone
outside the raid gets the kill.
- Modified several of the Planes of Power alternate entry quests to make
completing them faster.  Also, all of these quests will now give a "key" to
everyone in the group of the person that completes it.
- Corrected a spelling error in the text message given when you can no
longer add unflagged people to your raid ("to" is now "too").
- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause helmets to seem to disappear off a
character that was dealing with a merchant or casting an illusion.
- /Consent no longer gives both a success and fail message to player
consented.
- Frogloks wearing robes no longer lose the color on the bottom portion of
their robes when they zone.
- Fixed some issues with alchemy not combining into dose potions.
- Fixed a bug that could cause invalid and unchangeable numbers to appear in
spell-casting specialization skills if the skill was trained up after level
50.
- Merchants no longer claim that they will pay 1 copper for newbie items
that they can't actually buy.
- The player's first person perspective now changes correctly if the height
of their Froglok is changed.
- Removed an unneeded door in High Keep.
