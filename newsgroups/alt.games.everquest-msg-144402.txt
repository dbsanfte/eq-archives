erm... why on EARTH are people saying enchanters for a highly desired
raid class. Unless you're doing one of a couple of REALLY high end mobs
(eg: VT, Emp) more than a couple of enchanters could be replaced by any
number of classes. Enchanters are one of only a few classes who REALLY
need some endgame raid boosts, especially as they aren't compensated by
above norm soloing ability.

Best raid class?

Something totally scalable. Rogue, Ranger or Wizard probably, or more
specifically, whatever your target raiding force is lacking at the time
- probably mages heh.

Realistically though, lots could change between now and your getting to
raid level, especially since they're mucking about with relative balance
so much at the moment. Pick a class you're likely to enjoy playing at
L60. Raids can be pretty tedious for ALL classes, and if you're playing
a class you don't like just to be 'needed', chances are you won't enjoy
it. What class will you enjoy? Only you can answer that...
