Hmm....I seem to remember EQ1 taking more mobs than that at those levels,
but I was soloing a Wizard, and probably couldn't take as high a blue as
you.

Anyway...what about the downtime?  From what I've seen so far in EQ2,
downtime between fights is much lower than in EQ1.  Given in both games a
place with an ample supply of mobs, in which would it actually take longer
to level?  (Again, this will probably be class dependent...my Wizard had a
lot more downtime between mobs than, say, Druids).
