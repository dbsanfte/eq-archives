Just a little poll for everyone, just curious to see peoples
answers. Don't answer this too quickly just think about it
for a while.

Lets say you woke up tomorrow to this patch message:

Due to an infection by a vicious and cunning worm/virus that was
implanted by a disgruntled employee (who is now in the custody
of the authorities) and catastrophic failure of our back up systems
the entire character data base has been erased across all servers.

The only good news is that we were able to save the game
itself from an off site archive back up and we were able to
save all account information due to it being on a separate
billing system. Thus we have set up all the servers again, minus
any characters. You should be able to log into your accounts
and begin playing new characters. If you have any trouble
please contact customer service in the usual manner.

We are truly sorry for this inconvenience. As a small way to make
up for this tragedy we have extended all accounts by 3 months for free. We
hope you will continue to play and enjoy EverQuest and can look past this
incident.

-game development team

So the question is: Would you still keep playing? Would you
start another character and continue playing?

(Please set aside any speculation as to the truth of the virus/worm
story, or the motivation of the game designers/programmers.)

A friend asked me this question the other day.
