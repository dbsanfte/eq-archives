Since you got to the character creation screen,  it sounds like used
your evaluation reg-key in your Gold edition.  The Gold edition you
bought should have come with it's own reg-key and you need to use
that.  Don't worry about losing any characters since your characters
are linked to your log-in account and not the reg-key (it only
activates expansions for your account).  As long as you log-in with
the same username and password, your characters will still be there
(even if you uninstall EQ or use it on a different computer).
