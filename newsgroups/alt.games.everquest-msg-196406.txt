Actually, it's over 85.  I put about 70 training points into it =)

Good idea.  When they start to go blue, I'll do this.

I've never been to Nurga / Droga, but I think everything there will pretty 
much be red to him right now - he's about level 24.  The Rogue's only 
reason for creation is to be non-KoS to Chardok so he can drag corpses on 
an unfortunate wipe, so I'm going to PL him in those 2 places when he's 
ready.

>11/22 isnt all that bad. Shaded dagger ?:)

I think so - I've heard of it so that's probably it.  I went to the Bazaar 
to get him a piercer and found one that was 10/22 for 200pp.  I bought it 
from the vendor and the guy had another piercer so I looked at it.  It was 
11/22 and had some stat on it.  It was also 200pp.  I bought them both and 
have been dualing with 2 piercers.

We looted a Shadow Rager ( I think that is what it is called - one of the 
named dogs in Velks [ Tpor? ] dropped it - same one that drops the Barbed 
Ringmail ) 2 nights ago and someone was selling it for 5,250pp.  Seemed 
kind of high for that weapon, even with the 10str and proc/effect.

Thanks for the reply.
