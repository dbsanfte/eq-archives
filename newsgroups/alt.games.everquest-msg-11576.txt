I have, on a few occasions when I used to hunt bandits. I always see him the
NK end of the zone.

Maybe, sometimes 2 werewolves spawn in WK, I have seen the Werewolf chasing
the GM, they seem equal on speed,  Werewolves will aggro anything, saw one
attack Kithicor once, didn't kast long. Don't know if the Werewolf ever
caught the GM, didn't want to get to close at my (then) current level, GM
would have one anyway.

Not that any of that really helps, the Werewolf's most common spawn is at
the QH zone but, as I said, I have always seen the GM at the other side of
zone.
