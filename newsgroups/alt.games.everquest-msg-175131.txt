Buddy,

I'm a lvl 65 shaman with 189 aa points. I have enough to do on raids with
slowing/debuffing mobs and buffing everyone, then to worry about when my
buffs are fading on my guildmates. If you want my buffs, ask me for them. If
you say " buff me", I have 36 different buffs and you'll get whatever I want
to give you then. Be specific, be courteous and be respectful and you'll get
whatever you want from me. I am a shaman. My job is to debuff and to buff.
Get pissed off because I can't time every buff I give you then get them from
another shaman. I've got a mob to slow.

Cheers!
