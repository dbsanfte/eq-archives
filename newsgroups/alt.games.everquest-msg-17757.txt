I also have the idea that pets with weapons have a higher chance for max
dam. Not sure if this is true though. IIRC my pet did more dam then his
level's max with a 2h weapon but I prefer the dual-wield (which it does
barehanded as well).
1 attack of 38 or 2 of 32 (lvl 34 earth pet's max). My choise is made.

I am also not sure if proccing weapons proc when a pet wields it. I think
so, cause I THINK I've seen a few stun procs from my pet with a stun
proccing whip.

Pets start doing magical damage from pure-caster spell level 12, or in more
general terms: if the max-level of the pet casted by the spell is 11 or
higher. The pure-caster level 8 pets can go up to lvl 9, so your pet won't
hit wisps until you're at least 2 spell-levels further.
Just think of the pet as a small walking dot. Not much dam, but won't fade
either. Give it a small magic weapon if you really want it to hit wisps.
