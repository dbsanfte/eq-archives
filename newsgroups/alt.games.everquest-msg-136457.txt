That's ultimately what I hope for.  There are already so few
differences between marriage and common-law status in Canada, lets
scrap the remaining differences.  Organized religions could continue
to have whatever ceremonies they wish, but from the government's point
of view you would either be "single" or "in a relationship", with no
distinction between what is now called common-law and marriage.  Once
all the kinks got worked out the end result would probably be much
simpler and easier to work with.

Being polyamorous I hope they also eventually open relationships to be
between any two *or more* people but that's another battle.   There
are also some spousal-equivalent relationships out there (like
life-long roommates and "lifemates") who need recognition.  Ontario
law re: medical decisions reflects that: it avoids any mention of
spouse, if you are incapacitated decisions can be made by the person
"with whom you live in a relationship of primary importance".

A big concern here is the government enforcing relationship status.
While no one can force you to get married, in some cases you do NOT
have a choice about being considered as common-law.
