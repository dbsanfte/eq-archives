To be fair, they are worse at lower levels.   The poison trap can kill a
late 40's group.   And the curse traps, while not deadly, can certainly
cause a failure if nobody in the group has a remove curse type spell.  (not
uncommon at lower levels.)

And I saw a dipshit bard (and the group member that was somewhat close to
him)  annihilated in one hit from a trap.  I'm not sure what kind of trap
that was, as I was safely out of range.   Again, at high 40's low 50's.
