Strangely enough, people who have reason, or just want, to complain will
generally be of a mind to tolerate, enter, or start flamewars, thus pretty
much ensuring that the absolute best gauge of complaints will still be on
those boards.  The fact that Blizzard allows the complaints to be made and
stay up, as long as they stay moderately civil, shows that you're getting a
pretty clear picture of the severity and number of complaints (or at least
an approximate percentage).

So complaints (or lack of, as the case may be) from "the group from BNet"
don't matter?  A complaint is a complaint.

In fact, as maturity seems to matter to you, the people that seem *most*
likely to be affected by chasing and/or being in an "uber" guild, and
therefore by my prior statements most likely to be suffering the queues, are
the very people you seem to want to ignore, while making an argument that
there are more dissatisified people than I think...
