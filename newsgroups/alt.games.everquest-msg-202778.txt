    What would you like the pet to do? Be more like the sub-50's fire pet, a
meleer with a fire DD proc and innate DS? I think it's neat that mages have
a pet to use when pet melee isn't a great option, like on raids, but I don't
know enough about the class to know if that screws up something else.

    He apparently gives one AA's worth of XP per flag that was freed up. I
say "AA's worth of XP" because that's what it is - raw XP. If you don't have
XP set to 100% AA, you will get regular XP as well. And the charms we're
getting are, frankly, much better than anything I reasonably expected. I
lack the key to Time, so this is what the stats will be on the charm I get:

AC 18 STA 13 CHA 9 WIS 13 AGI 9 HP 72 MANA 90 all saves 9

    Compare that with the hypothetical charm I made up. Suffice to say I'm
still blown away by it.

    Oh, and the quest NPC was brought down because apparently he was taking
XP from people, not giving it. ;-)
