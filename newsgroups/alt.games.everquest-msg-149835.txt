Back up.  Shoot mob with arrow.  Sit while arrow is in flight.

Arrows take time to reach their target, so it should be possible to be
sitting when mez is broken.

Just a thought exercise, though, since being right next to mob means
prox aggro, and thats probably more effective than sit aggro.  Plus
if you get sit aggro, you get hit, which stands you up right away... and
if sit is the only thing putting you over the top, you lose it, I've had
that happen many times as a cleric.
