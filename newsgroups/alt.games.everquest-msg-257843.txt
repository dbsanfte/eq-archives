Inability to tank is why the melee aren't welcome under 60.  Casters 
don't have to tank, all they need to be able to do is stick spells.  And 
healers don't even need to be able to stick spells, just heal well 
enough to keep the tank alive.  Since clerics get Cheal at level 39, 
they are often welcome at astonishingly low levels; I recall my 40 
cleric getting invites to kill things with groups of level 60s, back 
before 61-65 were even in the game; you don't see that so much now 
because the 60s are often in zones where a 40 can't even cross the zone 
line, and in LDoN's where there's a 7 level range limit... but 55? 
Definately.

I don't recall feeling a -need- for levels as a cleric till trying to 
pass the POJ trial of execution shortly after POP release.  The post 60 
heals were pretty much a requirement for keeping people in partial TOV 
gear and with levels of 61 and under alive.  Nowadays maybe a 46 cleric 
would be sufficient, given the stuff thats available in the bazaar and 
the 65 buffs the group could pick up for a song in the bazaar... I 
dunno, haven't tried it.
