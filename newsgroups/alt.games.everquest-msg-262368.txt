Well, as long as your lawyer vetted it, and it was signed and 
notarized properly, then the insurance company *has* to at least 
keep it in your jacket. I know when I worked with StateFArm, we 
never had a premade *issue* living will, but we did keep copies 
of living wills, and sometimes even full wills in peoples 
jackets, or a request to notify a specific lawyer in case of an 
accident or death.

As to the class, they lawyers would be teaching it, not the HMOs 
and it would be pretty generic, who needs to know what legal 
information, what is involved in writing a will/living will/how 
to access the court system, pretty much what I described in my 
post. Modern Civics would have nothing to teach about HMOs except 
that they are available, and what you need to know about how they 
work. Same info would be good in knowing about the different 
retirement schicks - roth vs traditional ira, social security 
disability and retirement, workers unemployment insurance. A lot 
of things can take minimal time to explain and there are an awful 
lot of things that can be learned in a semester/trimester 
[whichever system your school happens to have.]
