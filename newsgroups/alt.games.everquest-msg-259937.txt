Seem's reasonable, though none of the other servers are reporting 
that... mind you all the world servers are down. Not only that, but the 
website appears to be melted down too. I'd say they had a major system 
glitch in the servers and their web server was not ready to handle the 
load of half the stress test participants logging on to it to see wtf 
was up. (I only checked because my poor drooling fanboi friend is going 
into shock with the server down, and emailed me in panic when he 
couldn't get to the site.)

The thing that occurred to me was that EQ movie with CCH (Chain 
Celestial Healing) when they 'need more cleric'...
