Um, you're right - I did miss it. The idea seems quite nice. But I'm not
so sure if it is a good idea unless for mobs needed for progression
only. After all guilds often raid targets again and again and again not
for the fun of it but for equipping members. Even changing the boss
names/appearances can't go endlessly. And if you let the computer do the
work then there would be some quite wierd named bosses around. :)

But I think you do recognize good players and bad players. :)
And when adventuring with them the choice where to go would be affected
by that knowledge. So ignoring the guilds here it is enough to know that
you have a killer group which can tackle nearly everything or a group
where the static spiderling spawn poses a threat. :)

Do I sense irony in here? ;) Sure they have faction. But this only
determines whether the mob attacks me or not. I admit I never recalled a
difference in pulling based on faction only on levels. :/

But I agree it is a nearly forgotten mechanic and could be improved a
lot.
