I agree... Vanguard sounds like it has really interesting and cool
ideas, but the level of bugs that my wife was seeing in beta was
unacceptable.  WoW certainly has bugs, but they are few enough that
you are actually surprised when you run into one.  There isn't
anything of the level of the EQ "wait forever for the boat that might
not show up" bugs.

When the CEO says "bugs are just a matter of course" that's a bad sign
that Sigil is more interested in pushing out content than making sure
it works.
