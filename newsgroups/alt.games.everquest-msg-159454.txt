Agnostic Dark Elves are not kos in Erudin as long as you stay away from the
two temples.
He did allude to being a rogue  (lockpick will travel)
I've made 'The trip' repeatedly at level 1. it is doable, with care.
suggestion:
Freeport, EC (gone are the days of free sow in tunnel for travellers, though
every time I'm in EC there's one or two stubborn idiots in the tunnel
spamming auctions like it was market day. I talked to one and he just didn't
want to go to bazaar because he didn't like lag (mind you he's a seller not
a buyer))
WC, Kithicor (I will go at night, but I WILL stay up on the northern wall)
Rivervale (inny de kos, BB de rogue possibly ok, agnostic DE ok as long as
you stay away from clerics/palllies.. that means sneak/hide past the first
guildhall)
Actually if you are low low level and not kos I'd hunt there.

What level ARE you Sebet, and what server are you on?

Anyway from rivervale, go through Misty Thicket, and sneak through the
goblin warrens of runnyeye

now you are in the Gorge of King Xorrb or some such.

climb the left hand wall and follow it to Eastern Karana.  People say I'm
crazy but it's much more fun that way.

Zone into EK turn right. Be careful, lotsa agro stuff through here, but lots
of room to. If Inny watch the druids and the paladin that hang out near the
river and bridge.

Cross into NK, land of the free roaming Griffon, home of the brave blue to
the griffons guards.
follow the river around (watch da bandits after the turn to the west) Watch
out for the guards at the stone bridge.

I think you can probably handle it from here
