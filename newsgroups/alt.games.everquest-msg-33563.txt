I hadn't even thought about haste.  I'll look into that.

I'm pretty much playing main tank right now.  So that's a good point.

I looked up evil eye bag. hehe That's a neat bag.  Mean critter it comes
from.

To me twinked is a level 5 char getting 5pp and a cracked staff. hehe

If I took every copper from every char I ever created, I don't think I'd hit
5250pp.  My smith char is also a tailor.  I'm hoping for mastery sometime
soon so I can make the bearskin bags.  I'm killing wisps again so I may try
for the evil eye bag too or one of the others you listed.

My cloak is a sleek black cloak, 1ac less than banded but 2 lbs lighter.  Is
it possible for me to quest that?  I'm thinking it probably comes from
everfrost.  I'll have to look it up.

I'm a master fletcher and am using my own bow and arrows.  My archery skill
is 44.  It doesn't go up as fast as my slashing and bashing because I
usually only get one shot per fight.  Sometimes I'll root a low blue and do
target practice.  One day I did a critical hit for, if I remember correctly,
36 points.  That was cool.

Thank you for a lot to think about.
