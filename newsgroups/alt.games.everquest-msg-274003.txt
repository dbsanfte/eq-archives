What we need is that all combinations of classes in a group have the
same chance to defeat any given mob,go away with the crap of "group
looking for slower/healer to move".
I admit this is a huge undertaking,but if they would have taken our
money to balance out EQ1 better instead of developing EQ2 with it or
releasing more unneeded expansions,which further destroy the class
balance,it would have been possible.
