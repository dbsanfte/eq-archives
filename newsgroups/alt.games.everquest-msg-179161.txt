Murphy's Law applies to word drops. You will never find the one you are 
looking for, until you no longer need it. Then it will fall like rain. 
It could be trivial, and you'd still get screwed.

Well, there's always the old fashioned way of going to the SK guild and 
buying it there. All pets up through 45 are for sale in Cabilis and 
Oggok. You may need to have a mule buy it for you, and search the spells 
well.

Not that I ever did that or anything, mind.... I did just get my 
research to 134. I think it maxes at 174. You can always ask an older 
necro to hit combine for you- but check what their skill is first!
