Are you saying that just because they spend their time uber-raiding (and the
occasional level 1 Crushbone raid) they're not friends? Or that they don't
have friends in other guilds?

Because that is what that guild DOES.

Maybe the core of Afterlife *has* been together since newbie levels. Why
should they suddenly start recruiting and training lowbies to do stuff they
grew tired of a year ago, when they *have* enough high end people to do the
stuff the guild now exists for? There are plenty other guilds doing that, and
as this is clearly not a guild aimed at casual players, low and midlevel
activities, or anything LESS than the top encounters in the game - how many
times do we have to point out that nobody's forcing you to want to be in a
guild like this? It makes as much sense as complaining about good/evil
roleplaying guilds requiring you act in certain ways.

I'm not in anything remotely resembing an uberguild and I have no problem
understanding why some people want to be in a guild that works like this.

No comment made on whether or not uberguild <soandso> on the whatnot server
is a bunch of arrogant elitist snobs, mind you. I'm just defending their
right to exist with requirements I never expect to meet and without catering
to lower level activities.
