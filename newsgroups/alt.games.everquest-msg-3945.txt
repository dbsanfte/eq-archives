Actually I don't think so...

Granted I'm a skeptic and I don't think most things are as they seem but lets take a
look at some of the possible reasoning here:

A)  Pissheads and Dweebs generally don't have as much to gain if the personages in
adult positions(Verant in this case) won't be paying attention to them

B)  Showoffs and Rebels have absolutely nothing to gain if their piers cannot see
them flipping the bird to those same adult personages.

C)  I find it highly unlikely that Verant does not monitor every single major form
of information posting available to Everquest players.

D)  If in fact they are monitoring the will have seen that the level childishness in
posting areas hosted by others is much lower(not nonexistant but nothing's perfect)
than in their own forums due to the lack of access to them for person's which A and
B apply to.

E)  Many people will not post if they see that someone else has already posted on
the same subject.  So by removing the visible posts I believe that in fact they get
a much more realistic view of how many people care about a givin subject.(10,000
people posting about Alchemy because 9000 of them think no one else has taken the
time to post about it.)

F)  Many people will post about an issue just because someone else did and they want
love the sound of their own voice.  So by removing the visible source these twits
feed on I believe that in fact they get a much more realistic view of how many
people truly do give a shit about a certain subject.

G)  In addition to D.... if in fact they are monitoring and they can see boards and
newsgroups where the well thought out posts don't continuosly drop off the bottom
they will have realized that there is a much easier way for them to gain access to
those posts even if the smart posters don't post on their site anymore.

Ok so I rambled a bit but I find it highly unlikely that we will see much of a
return of the dweebs and snotheads at least not at the volume we saw on the general
board, while simultaneously verant will continue to quietly collect information
about what we think and make changes based on it's own priorities lightly modified
by what we want.(as they always did.... now its just minus a bunch of the BS.)

Second I think it extremely childish to assume that persons running and employed by
a profitable company have no brain whatsoever or that maybe they want to screw their
paying clientelle as much as possible.
