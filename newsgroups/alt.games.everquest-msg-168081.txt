Looking for some advice as to what AA are more worth getting.  I
favor ones I can get with a few points over ones where I need to
spend dozens of points her e before I can spend there before I
can spend there before finally getting the one I wanted.... but
in the long run thats interesting too.

I'm particularly interested in fun strategies that become
possible with new AA's, as an example I've had a great deal of
fun with my recent purchase of Divine Arbitration.

At the moment, I'm a Baron, with Run 3, 3 points in wisdom, and a
point in... whatever it is that makes spot heals mildly bigger,
plus one level of divine arbitration and a point in the bank.
