If the name is in blatant violation of rather simple to follow rules,
then it's "so offensive that I have to petition it"... There is no
real reason to break that rule. You gain no advantage from it. The
only reason to break it is willful ignorance of the rules or some
rebel-wannabe streak that makes you feel you need to thumb your nose
at authority every chance you get.

Petitioning a name takes all of 5 seconds. Trust me, nothing's
stopping me from taking on the next mob. I can do it WHILE I take on
the next mob...
