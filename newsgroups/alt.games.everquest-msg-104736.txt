Immobilize, Atone, Sound of Force, Fear for adds.  Works like a
charm....    (That's fast root, mem wipe, and a 220 HP damage
stun for the non-clerics.)   Root saves them, Atone makes sure
they don't get XP, and the 220 damage wipes out anything in
WC they're likely to train to the ring for ghetto PLing.

And it's even better /role with my Abandoned Orc Shovel in my
primary slot so I don't have to get begged for buffs afterwards.
