The mere fact that you don't see the difference between "Oh goody" and 
"Shove it up your ass!" speaks volumes.

Yes, I am part of the Conspiracy Against Darktyger. I haven't been on any 
actual missions yet, but the Department of Antidarktyger Security is 
putting me in Black Helicopter Pilot Training courses next week.

Was I, now?

You said, in your first reply to my first post on this thread:

This would imply, to me anyway, that you know what the fuck you are talking 
about.

My claim about their test systems:

You want citations? The umbra problems mentioned earlier are one of them. 
Continual problems with Creative sound cards are another. The many many 
many times I have seen people with Popular Graphics Card X being unable to 
get on until the next "emergency patch" are a few more.

I cited. Your turn.

Or are you talking out of your ass?

It's very noble of you to be such a devout fanboy.

Where is that point? If I use an Athlon processor, is it my fault yet? What 
about a Creative sound card? Now is it my fault?
