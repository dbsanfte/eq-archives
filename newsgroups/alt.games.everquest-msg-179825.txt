you take cheap shots on the  uber guilds, and talk about a players skillis
are more important, but then tell me you only 50?  ROFL

Well first off you only 50ish.  Uber guilds are 65 across the board these
days.  So for high level content, PoP is pretty much a requirement,
particularly with the xp bonuses in the planes, and the way you can build up
AA points fast.  But you wouldn't know this since you only 50 and still
working on camping the Karnors Castle zoneline.

many of the uber guilds first requirement these days are your level, aa
points, then skill.  Afterall, as a druid, how much skill is it going to
take to snare a mob?, Play back up heals or evac when instructed?  heh

Listed below is a Simple uber guild requirements on one of the NEWEST U.S.
servers, Vazaelle.. "Caer Cadarn"  least I post some links and facts stead
of spew  out  my shit pipe like you do.

NOTE: this little tidbit, "Have access to Plane of Valor and Plane of
Storms". , this means PoP expansion, which also means you will get the raid
channel automatically via this expansion.  Uber 65 level raids have
attendance of 50 plus members or more, we are not talking about mini groups
hanging by zone line to Karnors Castle here.  Raid channel makes it easy to
setup and balance out  groups efficiently, the leaders see all the current
names/level/class via one window sorted out very nicely by group all on one
window, communication is a plus too, etc. Particularly when you are massing
a force of 50 plus that needs to work together as a team.

Caer Cadarn, current requirements...

Requirements:
Right now we're mainly looking for clerics, rangers and wizards but we
always keep an eye open for skilled applicants from any class.
You must be level 65.
You need to have your basic gear covered, we no longer go to the temple of
veeshan and thus we cannot supply you with basic Velious armor. We encourage
you to either buy the new cultural armor or multiquest Kael/Skyshrine armor
to get your basic gear up.
A good pointer is at least 4000hp as a warrior and 3600hp as a knight.
You need a decent Internet connection, we often have at least 50 people
attending raids and if you go linkdead constantly you will only be a burden.
Completed key for the emperor portal in Ssraeshza temple. We can help you
get the insignia from the 3rd floor. (Talk to us about help with the key.)
All priest and caster classes must have Spell Casting Mastery 3.
Warriors and Knight classes must have Natural Durability 3 and Combat
Agility 3.
Meet the minimum number of aa required for your class.
Have access to Plane of Valor and Plane of Storms.
A base set of resistance gear will get you far.
