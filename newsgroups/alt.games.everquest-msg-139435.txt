Yep Dave99, you are correct.  That's why cowards such as yourself and
Goondi/Dicklicker feel so safe behind your keyboards.. You can attack

That is why you are cowards...  None of you would have the BALLS to

Hell, ya'all don't even have the balls to say it to me in IRC...  I
already chased YOU outta there once..  :^)
