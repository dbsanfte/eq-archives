Now I know that's not true, in the sense that it's never been attributed to
the cleric.  I got Mark of Retribution almost immediately after I got
Luclin, and at that time a guildmate was powerlevelling a character of his
that he was going to use as a bot.  I came along to help, and the first time
I casted MoR on one of the mobs, and did nothing else, I got the kill.  We
tried it out a couple more times just to see if something screwy was going
on, and I got the kills on all of them, even though all I was doing was
casting MoR on the mobs he was fighting.

This was a long time ago, and I haven't bothered to try MoR again while
powerlevelling (haven't done much PLing with my cleric anyway), and I
haven't seen a patch message which stated that it had been changed.
