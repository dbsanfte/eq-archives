Does your guild also supply you with components?  Does it at least reimburse
you for them?  In the guild I am in, noone expects that a cleric will always
symbol in a nonraid situation.  In a raid, the cleric(s) are supplied with
dots, and/or reimbursed for them from the guild coffers.  Any other method
seems blatantly unfair to the cleric(s).
