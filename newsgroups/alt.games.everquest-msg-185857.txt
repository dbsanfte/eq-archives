I have to disagree ...

I have a fetish of the Nimble (Ac 2 mod dodge 2% 5 Agi 5 Dex) on my
beastlord I have have noticed a HUGE diffrence (Please excuse the spelling
its early).

As a pre-50 Beastlord my dodge caps out at only 125 an extra 2 % gives me a
dodge skill of 127.5%, doesnt sound alot does it ?
But when you consider most mobs I'm fighting at less double attack any
chance of completly avoiding damage is good ... You could say if I get an
item with better AC I could also avoid more damage but as a beastlord its
hard to get items with high AC due to the armour restrictions.

It depends on your class really, as a plate class I would say its not really
worth it, but as a more skill dependant class (Monk, Beasty and to an extent
Rogue) its an excellent item.

Any chance you play on AB ?

I payed 250pp for my Fetish and that was still 200 or so cheaper than the
rest of the bazaar.
