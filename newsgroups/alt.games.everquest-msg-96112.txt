Probably another method by VI to help sink money out of the

Human beings enjoy variable reward mechanisms. The
satisfaction you feel when you finally conjure the *best*
pet is one of the many variable reward mechanisms built into
EverQuest.

You should parse out the damage dealing and absorbing
characteristics of your best and worst pets sometime. I know
pet casters obsess over summoning the *best* pet, but I bet
there isn't a very substantial performance difference among
them.

Don't the Mage focus quest items help summon better pets?
