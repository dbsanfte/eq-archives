OP said he was a necromancer pulling to a group.  If he wanted time for 
debuffs or dotting, pulling with a snare would be the way to do that, 
but in RM I don't think it would be a wise way; a running HG is clearly 
a pulled HG, while one thats sauntering slowly accross the zone at 
snared speed is more easily mistaken as an unclaimed roamer.

Aye, you'll note I didn't point him in the direction of (game with 
superior GM service).  Rumor has it that the legends server is the way 
to go if that's your need; personally I hate the idea that they are 
deliberately underserving the rest of the servers in order to encourage 
people to move to a more expensive one.

A less paranoid person, though, would say that its merely an experiment; 
they want to see if its more profitable to undersupport, or to overcharge.
