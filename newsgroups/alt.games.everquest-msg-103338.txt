Let me try...
The right of the people to keep and bear arms will not be infringed
upon  because a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of
a free State.

I add nor omit anything from the Original:
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed

-- and yes I am a 2nd amendment nut job. 

In context the rewrite I used stands up to the original intepretation
for ~150 years, until the 1920s.

Centi Longswords.
