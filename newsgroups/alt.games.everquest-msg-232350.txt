At higher levels you get alot more points per mission completed tho so 150
isn't so hard to reach.  FWIW, I have used this spell one time.  It requires 2
dots, and usually a couple of people in my groups have virtue or something on. 
Then of course halfway thru the dungeon their virtue runs out and you have to
cast temp again anyway.....
