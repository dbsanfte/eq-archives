There's a monk usable weapon that procs engulfing darkness... a
snare effect.  Put that together with a Fear casting cleric and you
have an operation fear kite plan that kicks mob butt... if your dex
is high enough to reliably proc.

On the other hand, doing this is a matter of swapping in some
dex gear for your normal wear, not your mainstay plan for
your EQ lifespan.
