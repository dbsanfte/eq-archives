------------------------------

(Add to the line about the hp/mana augmentations that drop in adventures 
now being type 7):


** Zones and NPCs **

- Two new raid zones have been added to the Lost Dungeons on the Legends 
server.  These are Guk-themed raids, one for Elemental Plane and one for 
Time Plane capable raiders.

- The revamped Plane of Mischief is now available on all Live servers.

- There were some situations where the warders in Vex Thal could be up, but 
the bosses needed to kill them would not be available.  That shouldn't 
happen anymore.

- Shrunk the giant wolves that appeared in the lands.

- The Coirnav encounter has been changed.  Be much more careful if you have 
been relying on stuns to deal with this encounter.

- Corrected an issue with the Filth Gorgers that was causing them to remain 
around with they were supposed to despawn.

- Soldiers of Madness in Grieg's End will no longer be so unbelievably 
numerous.

- Zoning into the Plane of Fire will no longer cause characters to 
occasionally take 20k points of damage.

- The Froglok Hunter and Forager will no longer be killed by the 
inhabitants of Trakanon's Teeth, so they should be easier to find.

- When Mithaniel Marr is killed, his planar projection now spawns in the 
middle of his room rather than at the point of death.  This fixes a problem 
that could cause the projection to appear out of reach.

- The Qeynos investigator is now taking "follow me" orders again.


** Adventures **

- Every character that successfully completes an adventure will now get at 
least one point as a reward.   This is also true for the "consolation" 
rewards.

- Completing Hard adventures will yield more points.

- Several trap spells on interactive objects have had their severity 
reduced.

- Added some new type 7 and type 8 augmentations to various adventure 
merchants.

- It will be clearer now which raids are "hard" and which are "normal".  
Hard raids are intended for Time capable guilds.  They are very hard.

- All raid recruiters now properly check to be sure that you have completed 
two adventures in their respective themes before they will give out the 
raid.

- Fixed an issue in a Mistmoore's Catacomb raid that was preventing players 
from accessing an interactive object they had earned for killing Sfisithik.

- Removed the ability to see through Shroud of Stealth from some of the 
NPCs that appear in LDoN Raids.

- There was a misconception about the behavior of goblins in some Rujarkian 
Hills adventures.  Goblins that are fleeing because they are unwilling to 
die or are seeking help will make it clear that they are doing so.  We also 
corrected an issue that could cause these goblins to "ping pong" in some 
cases.

- All of the "flavor" NPCs in dungeons (usually those that are lying down, 
nearly dead) will display full health to make it impossible to tell what 
kind of NPC they are (friend or foe) simply by looking at their health 
level.

- Hostages will no longer be attacked by their captors.

- We thinned out the population in the Grand Library and a few other 
Miragul's Menagerie themed zones to bring the challenge in line.

- Rats in Mistmoore's Catacombs are now animals, shadows are now summoned.


** Items and Objects **

- Corrected a bug that allowed players to buy multiple lore augmentations 
if they were in a bag (which also caused issues when trying to loot corpses 
with those items).  If you had multiple lore items, the extra items will be 
removed.  A refund for the points spent on those items will be made when 
they are deleted.

- Broken Chunk of Coal, Cracked Ruby, and Charred Pebble are no longer 
valid augmentations.  If you had these augmentations bonded to an item, you 
will find them on your cursor.  You can take those items to Dible Hedledrap 
in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.

- Perfect Garnet of Constitution, Pristine Garnet of Constitution, Perfect 
Sapphire of Insight, and Pristine Sapphire of Insight can be turned in to 
Dible Heldedrap in South Ro.  He will replace them with type 8 versions of 
the same items.

- Changed pre-LDoN items to have a single slot of type 7 instead of 1.  
Some LDoN items which had a slot type 1 were also changed to type 7.

- Fixed a bug with the Adventurer's Stone that would sometimes cause it to 
not display its bonuses.

- Interactive objects will now only appear on LDoN raids when the main boss 
has been killed. This change was done to prevent an exploit, and is a 
temporary change.

- We have improved the types of rewards that can be found in interactive 
objects to improve the reward given for the risk taken by opening them.

- Fixed a bug that prevented augments with no deity restrictions from 
combining with deity-restricted items.

- Added a message that should make it clearer when a character is unable to 
loot an interactive object because they are on an NPC's hate list.

- Hand-to-hand weapons are now part of the one-handed restriction on 
augmentations.  So augmentations that say they can be used with one-handed 
items will also work with hand-to-hand items.

- Geomancer's Crown of Reformation now fits in the head slot and the effect 
is worn instead of right clicked.

- Gravestone of Dire Melodies and the Limestone Shard of Battle Cries will 
now properly modify instrument skills.

- All of Royal Attendant Armor will now show up as plate armor.

- Rogue pets focused with Summoner's Boon should no longer lose the ability 
to backstab.

- Shard of Shrunken Bone was changed from Shield of Pain III to Shield of 
Pain II.

- Changed many of the new Lost Dungeons "shields" to make them useable as 
shields (they can be used to bash now).

- Removed augmentation slots from the following items: Primal Velium 
Knight's Sword, Divine Hammer of Consternation, Breezeboot's Frigid 
Gnasher, Primal Velium Fist Wraps, Primal Velium Battlehammer, Primal 
Velium Spear, Primal Velium Claidhmore, Primal Velium Brawl Stick, Primal 
Velium War Lance, Primal Velium Reinforced Bow, Primal Velium Battle Axe, 
Primal Velium Warsword, Ancient Prismatic Bow, Ancient Prismatic Lance, 
Ancient Prismatic Spear, Ancient Prismatic Claymore, Ancient Prismatic 
Brawl Stick, Ancient Prismatic Battlehammer, Ancient Prismatic Warsword, 
Ancient Prismatic Axe, Ancient Prismatic Fist Wraps, Ancient Prismatic 
Staff, Ancient Prismatic Stiletto, and Ancient Prismatic Mace.

- Changed some weapons dropped from rare NPC's in LDoN zones to have slot 
type 4 instead of 1.

- Changed Pristine Limestone of Hatred to Vengeance IV.

- The hp/mana augmentations that dropped in adventures as slot 1 items will 
no longer drop.  They have been replaced with similar items that fit into 
slot 7.

- Made changes to various stats and effects on Plane of Time items.

- Changed the level required to use the right-click effect on Wild Lord 
Armor to 45, to match all other Kunark armor.

- Corrected a bug with mounts that would sometimes leave the horse buff up 
without the actual mount.  Also corrected a problem that could cause a 
player to be unable to summon a mount.

- Fixed the haste on Spiritbound Mystic's Torch

- Altered the damage and delay on the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic to 
be more appropriate for where it drops


** For the New Player **

- Find Feature added.  This will create a mystical indication of the path 
to take to find certain people.  This feature works in the Bazaar and in 
newbie zones and cities.  In the Bazaar you just click on the merchant you 
seek in the Bazaar window and click the Find Trader button.  For all other 
uses, just hit CTRL+F to open the window, select someone on the list and 
click the Find button.  This will locate any Bazaar trader or any NPC with 
an alternate name, such as (Spell Vendor).  The exception is that it will 
not locate NPCs in the Wayfarer's Camps.

- The auto-attack key now defaults to Q (not A).

- New characters start with their weapons and armor equipped.

- New characters start with their spells scribed and memorized.

- When a caster reaches the level required for one of the first two rings 
of new spells, they will get a message informing them that new spells are 
available.

- New characters will begin with a stack of bandages.  These bandages 
cannot be sold or traded.

- When a character trains in a hotbutton-able skill that he did not 
previously have skill in, a hotbutton for that skill is created on the 
cursor.

- New characters will have a page of hotbuttons set for them based on the 
skills given to them by their class and race.


** Interface **

- Merchants now separate items with different charges in their list. For 
example, 9 dose and 10 dose potions will show up as separate items on the 
merchant's list.  Items with the same amount of charges will be stacked.  
NOTE: This will remove the ability to "recharge" items by selling them to a 
vendor and buying them back.

- The Bazaar now supports selling different charged items. For example, a 
10 dose potion with 9 charges can be sold for 90 plat., while a 10 dose 
version of the same potion can be sold for 100 plat.  NOTE: All currently 
priced charged items will no longer have a price attached and will need to 
be reset by the trader.

- Pet buffs are now visible in the pet window. A small icon will display 
for each buff on the pet (up to 30 - you may need to resize the pet 
window).  You can hover your mouse over the icon to see the spell name.  
Alt left-click or right-click and hold for spell info box (which only 
contains name and icon).

- Improved the functionality of the ESC key.  Windows close in the opposite 
order that they were opened.

- When World Containers (ovens, kilns, augmentation sealers and similar 
items) are closed, No Drop items in those containers will be placed in the 
character's inventory.  If it will not fit there, it will appear on their 
cursor.

- The "Only show items I can use" option in the Adventure Merchant window 
will be saved when you log out.

- Hotbuttons created using the Abilities and Combat skill lists are no 
longer connected to the buttons in the Actions window.  This means that you 
can create a button on the Abilities or Combat section of the actions 
window, drag that button to the hotbutton window, then change the button on 
the Abilities or Combat section, and the hotbutton you made will not 
change.  This allows you to create hotbuttons for ALL of your character's 
skills, not just the ones that can fit in the Actions window.

- You can now use the (`) key to "Target nearest NPC", in addition to F8.

- Shared bank slots will no longer accept rentable containers with no-rent 
items in them.

- A new system for the leaderboard has been implemented to track adventures 
by their difficulty.  You can sort by normal/hard/all difficulty.  Not only 
will this display the stats for the leaders, but you will also be able to 
see your own successes and failures at the bottom, based on the sorting you 
chose for the leaderboard.  So, for example, if you filter the leaderboard 
by Miragul's Wins and choose Hard, you will not only see the leaders for 
Hard adventures in that theme, you will see your own statistics for Hard 
Miragul's adventures.  NOTE:  Because this tracking is new, it will only be 
able to differentiate hard and normal adventures from the time of this 
update onward.  Past adventures will be treated as if they were normal 
difficulty.

- /autojoin is now saved per character, not for all characters.

- The Open and Inspect buttons are no longer "grayed-out" when Lay on Hands 
or Harm Touch are used.

- Merchant inventories will refresh properly after a character purchases 
the last of an item in inventory.


** Spells **

- Casting Grow on an unshrunk shaman pet will no longer shrink the pet.

- Remove Minor Curse cures 2 curse counters instead of 3-4.

- Lich and Pact of Hate now use different colored skeleton models.

- Monster Summoning will summon the correct models, not just earth 
elementals.

- Frostreaver's Blessing will no longer block the bard song Wind of Marr.  
We realize there are still some stacking issues with these spells, and we 
hope to resolve them soon.


** Tradeskills **

- The Blessed Steel Arrowheads recipe will return the file.

- NPC Merchants will now pay less for Steel Hunter Arrows, Steel 
Arrowshafts, and Steel Fletch.

- The Muckskipper Chowder recipe no longer returns a pot on a failure or 
success, since the recipe does not require a pot at all.

- The recipe for the "Lemming Fur Backpack" now requires an Embroidering 
Needle instead of a Sewing Needle.


** Alternate Advancement **

- Jewelcraft Mastery works properly now.

- Frenzied Burnout will no longer last indefinitely on a charmed pet.
