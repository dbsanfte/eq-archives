I am a member of a small growing guild on Karana server. We are growing
stronger and wiser and are going to fight in Hate soon. I would like to get
as much info as possible to help us through our first planes fighting. I am
looking for links to help me with this. Of course any other info you would
like to leave here that would be helpful. I see a lot of helpful people on
this newsgroup, and I want to thank you in advance. /bow  /salute,
Thank you )
