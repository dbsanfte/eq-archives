It's far from inevitable unless you have a cleric or bard that needs help 
with their epic 1.0.  Don't know of any other classes off hand that 
require killing mobs on RoS faction.  For that matter, the cleric one can 
be done without hosing faction, but it's a pain in the butt to only kill 
nonfaction reducing mobs instead of a general slaughter.
