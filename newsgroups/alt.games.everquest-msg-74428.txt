I had the opposite problem once.  I camped on the East Freeport
docks, *way* back by the stone wall (i.e., nowhere near where the
boat picks people up).  When I returned to the game later,
I was ON THE BOAT OUT IN THE OCEAN OF TEARS.

WTF?

I petitioned, mostly to alert them to the bug, and a kindly GM
summoned me back to the Freeport docks where I was supposed to be
instead of making me do the big round trip voyage.

The GM told me that that sort of thing happened from time to
time.  You just have to wonder how weird the game code is
to allow things like that...
