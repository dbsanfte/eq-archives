They have such poor sales in the stores now that the stores are no 
longer willing to give shelf space to Sony/Verant for Everquest.

This is a dieing game, and Sony is killing it more and more every day, 
by their own doing.  The last major patch is a perfect example of it.  
Then on top of that they screw what loyal customers they had for their 
$99 yearly fee just because they had to change credit card details.  
Yeah, real wonderful company here. (Yes I know what their forums say, 
but their saying one thing and doing another).  In fact everything they 
say is a lie.

You would also think, see that that expansion won't be in stores, then 
technically Sony/Verant should be charging a MUCH lower fee as the store 
no longer has its typical 50% markup.  But no, the great company that 
Sony/Verant is, they would rather stick it to the customer and keep the 
money for their Porches.
