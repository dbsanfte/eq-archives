From the shadows, the mysterious Jamie Norwood

Cry more noob.

Newsflash: EQ is not going to be fun for everyone no matter what.
Better it stays true to what got it in the number 1 spot in the first
place.

Another person who doesn't understand that whether or not you do
something, the fact everyone can changes everything anyways.

#1 mmorpg speaks for itself. And of course you're just pulling that
number out of your ass.

Typical irrelevent shot from someone without a clue.
