Well, the idea is they finally move the story line on...How long has the
Militia and Paladins been at each other for control of FP? How long has Dec
been trying to over throw Ant...erm I mean, Kane.
What I would be interested in seeing, is what they will be calling the
expansions (Kunark, Velious et al will apparently be available in this
format, as before) The Remnants of the Ruins of Kunark? The Re opened Wounds
of Velious?
