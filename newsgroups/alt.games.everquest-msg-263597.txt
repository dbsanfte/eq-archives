The problem is that they NAMED it Everquest, albeit with a 2 on the end. 
They SHOULD have called it something else like "Shards of Norrath" or 
something if they truly wanted to separate the two. The reality is that 
they want the name recognition to draw all types of customers, including 
those that used to and/or still do play the original Everquest.

I haven't had a chance to play the game, but to me this is HUGE. It's a 
real downer because it takes away the tactical/strategic portion of EQ 
that made the game so great and a challenge for a long time.
