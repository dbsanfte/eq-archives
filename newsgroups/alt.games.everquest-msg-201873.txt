For the fourth time in my EQ career, I started a chanter.  Human ...
agnostic.  He was progressing nicely into his teens, and at that point I put
him down to focus on getting my ranger planes-enabled.

Then he just got stuck at 15.

I have a DE necro on account 2 that's been someone I pull out when I'm
feeling evil.  The necro's 16.

The other day, I start to think, "Hmmm ... if I hook the chanter up with the
necro, the necro can pull him up to 16.  After that, they can both go on
about their merry ways.".

So I head the chanter over to where I have the necro parked ... the hermit
in SK.  The chanter Tashes ... the necro does the rest of the work (none of
the chanter's other spells will stick). In an hour or so, ding 16 on the
chanter and ding 17 on the necro (on the same pull).

Whoopee!  I have a Breezer for the first time in the nearly three years I'm
been playing this game.  Run the chanter around, get all his spells, then
decide for grins I'll hook him up with the necro to get his buffers.  Then
the realization sets in ......

Holy cow, what an effective combination this is.

Chanter mezzes, tashes, disempowers, and slows.  Necro throws Scent of Dusk.
Chanter fears with Chase the Moon, and since it has a debuff component it
doesn't break mez.  Finally, after all of that, the necro pulls with
darkness, sics the pet, and starts dotting.  Chanter re-casts Chase the Moon
before it breaks, then everyone has a seat and waits for Jabober and the
dots to finish off the hermit.

Three minutes later, Lather .... rinse .... repeat.  A couple of hours
later, ding 18 on the necro.  Two pulls later, ding 17 on the chanter.

With the grouping XP changes coming down the road, I think these two are
going to be buddies for a long, long time.

It's going to be interesting to see what happens when I get in a situation
where the chanter has to manage crowd control in a two-boxing environment.
That may limit their hunting grounds a bit ... I'll have to have them in
places where if the pull goes sour no one else is in harm's way.
