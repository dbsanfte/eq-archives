Go for wis items take the +mana as bonus as it sometimes has both.

actually from the beginning on. Why at the 1st lvls a huge amount of extra
mana seems cool but you get used to a certain amount of extra mana that
later is not sufficient anymore while wisrelated mana grows by lvl, and also
keeps up with the more manaconsuming spells you will get. So concentrate on
wis cause later on you'll progit from it much more than of a bit of mana.
(at your lvl consider that +15 mana and check how much mana your
healingspells cost)

On allakhazam there is a list of all focuseffects, check them out but don't
expect 50% modifiers, expect 10%. (the figures relate to the lvl of spells
they work up to) but check the list and decide wich ones are appropiate for
you.
