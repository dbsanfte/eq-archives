I have the evolutions game pack and I just bought platinum with all the
expansions up to GoD. Can I load the game with the disks, or will that
overwrite my game info and characters etc? Do I have to install with a
download, because that patch is huge! I just don't want to lose my chars,
but I want the two extra expansions....anybody have advice?
