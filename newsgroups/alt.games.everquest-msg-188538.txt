I would have to see some evidence of the formula skill/10 mana per tick, if
that were so I should regen my mana at more than double my present rate with
just KEI and PotG on.

The numbers reflect soloing, bardsong is simply not a part of the equation,
as you can't walk away and still have it. Grouping is a far different game
than soloing.
