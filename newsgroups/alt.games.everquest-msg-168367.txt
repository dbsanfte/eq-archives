Quilljar has a perfect right to extoll the wonders of E-Dimension 3D
glasses, just as others like me have a right to consider them a far from
perfect gimmick. However, having bought a pair of these things on the basis
of reading reviews on a number of flightsim web sites I no longer trust the
reviewers. I've since noticed that many of these sites seem to have some
sort of sponsorship from E-Dimension. I was considering buying a premium
membership to either flightsim.com or surclaro.com but have decided against
paying for advertising disguised as reviews.
