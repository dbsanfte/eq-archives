I logged on at 22:21 UK time and must have been about the last one to
get on as first thing I saw was message to log off NOW - server going
down and as i was logging out I got message that logon server not
accepting new connections.

So should be back about 23:30 UK time - i.e. 40 mins from this post

HTH
Cheers
