Dunno, I don't consider LoE to be undesirable.  Sounds like a good way to
pass underway time, or a boring duty day.

So, if you wanted that key chain that they put in the LDoN package, should
you be able to sue them for tying it to the purchase of the expansion?
Should all companies be prevented from bundling bonus material in any
product?  The mere fact that such practice is illegal tells me that the
legislature needs to be reigned in.  It's none of their business how a
company chooses to price or package their products, as long as the content
of those products do not violate the law.
