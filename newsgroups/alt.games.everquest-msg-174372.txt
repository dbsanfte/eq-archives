I ran into that in a group this past weekend also, the person that died
still had 3% HP left and as sliver of red on the bar but was sitting naked
in PoK.  I also ran into another strange one Saturday night.  A group of us
headed to CT and the monked died cause FD failed, when our rogue went out to
drag his body back the body was still standing and walking on the spot.  It
still said the normal "Dead_Monk_01's Corpse" but he was walking on the
spot.  Lotsa strange stuff since the last patch.
