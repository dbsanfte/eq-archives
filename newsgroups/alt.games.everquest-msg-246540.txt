  You saw a guy in green and black leather, right? I ask because 
apparently there's someone running around calling himself "Onslaughter". 
I've already gotten tells meant for him a couple of times by mistake.

be by the time you read this. Heh.

I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
