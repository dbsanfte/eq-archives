Yes in the manual
Emotes and pauses are there as well.

I would not attempt to make too much of a complex macro.
The reason being If you get a fizzle the whole macro must complete.

That said I do make macro's with a built in fizzle correction
/pause 4,/cast 1 --> a point 4 second pause <after> casting spellslot 1 if
fizzle
/cast 2              --> if not fizzle cannot do this command due to line 1
casting.
/gsay casting spell ( whatever one is ) on %T ( target) ....
