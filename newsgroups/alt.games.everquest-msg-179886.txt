Not necissarily true. We have a few 60+ characters in our guild, but
it is nowhere near a "raiding guild" and, quite honestly, doesn't have
the organization required to become one. Those 60+ people have no
problem raiding. Sure, it's not as easy to play in the upper levels
raiding and such without being in a "raiding guild", but it can be
done. Takes more playing the political aspects and making and
upholding a good reputation for yourself.
