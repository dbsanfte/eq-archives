Have fun.  =)  The early levels are the ones I miss.  You can stay in the
WFP and EFP newb zones til around 5 or 6 I think.  Can't really remember but
ideally you want to stay in zones where you're fighting blues mobs solo,
yellows and reds in groups.  If you're twinked you can prolly tackle a
yellow or red solo, if you're feeling lucky.

Whatever you do, don't level past like 51.  Because there's just about
nothing to do after that....unless, of course you're a solo class, or in an
Uberguild, or you actually *enjoy* sitting at the zone in to a high level
dungeon /shouting "52 Warrior LFG!!!"

OK I'm getting a little off track but that will lead me into my next
post....

=)

Cheers
