Ben is right, I too am like that - when I am not busy playing, I am
researching - Allakhazam's, Everlore, my specific class site, Castersrealm,
EqAtlas, Eqitems, etc etc etc.  So by lvl 40 I have 156 STR, 124STA, 115AGI,
110DEX, 107WIS, and my only other character is lvl 4.  As Ben said, you
gotta know what you want, how much you are gonna pay for it, where to get
the money, and play the market.  Personally though I got sick of hanging
around NFP, so I am out to level now.

So on the leveling side of things - depends if you prefer to fight indoors
or outdoors, and also what class you are etc.  For me, at lvl 10 I was in
Crushbone, lvl 12-15 dervs, lvl 15-18 orcs in oasis, 18-22 Unrest and
Highpass, 22-32 Highkeep, 33-41 Lower Guk.  I went from 19-39 in four weeks
of playing about 3 hours a day during my holidays.  Once again it came down
to research - knowing where to get the best exp at the best time.  If you
prefer outdoor though LoIO at lvl 17-30 is good, DL at 30+, both in Kunark.
My suggestion is try a few places, see how you like them and like the exp,
and then KILL KILL KILL.
