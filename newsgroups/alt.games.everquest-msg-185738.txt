Hi:

I have a question concerning the Wizard epic. I'm level 61 and though I'm
not guilded I'm fortunate enough to have two of the three parts of my epic.
I have the Gnarled Staff from VS as well as the Staff of Gabstik from the
Enraged Golem quest.

I've found someone that has the Blue Crystal Staff that drops from Phinny,
and we're currently trying to multi-quest my epic. However, things are made
rather complicated, as the chap that has the BCS is also a Dark-Elf
Necromancer that worships Innoruuk. To further complicate matters, it is
recognized that any Wizard that started their epic before August 2002 could
very well be faction bugged.

My question is though - is there *any* way that the Necromancer and I can
turn-in our items as a MQ? The simple way to find the answer is obviously to
let the Necromancer con my NPC, but of course, it's not that easy, as I have
to hand a note to Dargon in Halas, and as soon as I've done that, my NPC
will spawn in her place. I only get one chance to spawn my NPC, so it's
imperative that I know before-hand what to do.

It has been suggested that the Necromancer should drink a potion of illusion
in Halas - Barbarian illusion would be our best bet. But if he drinks the
potion, will this then mask his faction issues?

Another method would be to have an Enchanter with us that can cast illusion
on the Necromancer, but again, I'm unsure as to whether this will nullify
faction.

Are Dargon and Arantir (the spawned NPC) on the *same* faction?

I'd be heartbroken to lose my two staves, and I seriously doubt that I'll be
able to get them again.

Given that the *invis trick* is extremely risky, can someone please give me
a few pointers as to whether this MQ can even go ahead?

I appreciate your time,

Stevie.
