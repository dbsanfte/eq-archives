Tyger, you are obviously opposed to AD&D.  We get that.  It is OK to not
like that game.  Everyone has different tastes.  I cannot figure out just
what has happened to you to make you feel so strongly, but you are entitled
to your opinion just as each and every person on this planet is.  I will not
debate you further.  If you had a bad experience with the game at some point
that is a shame.  AD&D is a fine system with great potential even if they do
come up with a new version more frequently than Microsoft comes out with a
new Windows.

You also need to realize that if it were not for games LIKE AD&D as well as
that game itself, there wouldn't be computerized RPG's.  At least not as we
see them today.  I don't believe I claimed ANYWHERE in my post that AD&D
invented Drow.  I believe I said that is the word they use to describe their
Dark Elves.  Please don't read more into people's posts than is actually
there.

Again Tyger, EQ is just a game.  Lots of people pay lots of money for the
priviledge of playing it.  If some of those people want to call their Dark
Elves "Drow", then so be it.  If others want to call their Dark Elves
"Platypusses" then so be it.  It does not change the fact that DE's in EQ
are blue skinned, white haired little buggers that live in Neriak and are
hated by most of the rest of the game world.

I'm getting the impression that, as the EQ Nazi, you probably get very
pissed (to the point of foaming at the mouth apparently) when you see
characters with funny names as well.  I mean, an Ogre who names himself
"Pfil Mashorts" is just wrong isn't it?  That Ogre does exist in the game
and I've run into him on numerous occasions on TP and he is a great guy who
is very creative in my opinion.  Again, that is my OPINION.  Opinions are
like assholes hon.  Everyone has one and most of em stink.  You need to
accept that and move on or you will end up dead from a heart attack or other
stress related disease at an early age.

I notice the rest of the group here isn't saying anything about this thread,
obviously they are smarter than I as they know better than to waste their
typing skills trying to make you understand that a game is a game is a game.
I am curious though, for the rest of you that are following this thread...
Are all of you this annoyed at the use of the word "Drow" when referring to
EQ's Dark Elves?  And, if you are not this violently opposed to it, do you
ever use the term yourself to describe them?

Tyger I noticed that you chose not to respond to my listing of my Role
Playine experience.  I tend to believe that is probably because I've been
involved in RPG gaming longer than you have probably been alive.  You are
welcome to consider my opinions pinheaded or whatever term you choose to
use.  Fact of the matter is, I choose not to get hung up over trivial things
in life.  There are far more important things going on in the REAL world to
worry about.
