  This is part of what I like about playing on Firiona Vie... at least for
now.  There aren't enough high level characters who have farmed out great
loot off high level mobs, so the prices are still high on really good items,
if they're even on the market.  Sure, I can't get the best stuff for as
cheap, but I can have a good time getting some other decent stuff.  Though
eventually this trend will probably reverse as the server population level
rises, and when all that stuff that is normally NO DROP starts hitting the
market.  If something isn't done, somebody will probably be selling planar
armor pieces for 500pp in a couple years. :P

  I don't know a lot about the Twilight armor you mention, though this is
partially a problem of the mudflated economy, which Verant hasn't yet
addressed.  But if the quest design is sound, and better stuff can be gotten
more easily, the simple solution is to uptweak the quested stuff... which
maybe they'll do. The Ghoulbane is, in my book, a success story... there are
going to be less successful implementations of the concept, but all in all I
think things will be better for it all.
