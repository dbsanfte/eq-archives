Shrug. Us hybrids and druids (strangely, I only know a few necros...) are
having great fun doing things without the "unholy trinity" that folks say
cant be done.

Well. Not stricly true. We quite often have an enchanter, or a cleric,
but regularly make do with only one or the other, and frequently on
less uber stuff just use a shaman to replace both.

Sui, Ranger, still having LOTS of fun ;-) 

(I just cant imagine the tedium of being pure melee.... Spells and stuff
are what make my character interesting... the melee is fun, but the
spells give tactics flavour. I guess I'll find out with my new kittie
rogue ;) )
