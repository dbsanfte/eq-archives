I got 168 in Begging, max i got are stil 1 sp. After a certain skill you 
dont get aggro any more (dont know exact number, got to 150 skill by 
begging from mobs, was told by another player. Beggar hating guards 
might still attack, havent tested), but for some reason, you can only 
beg 20 times or so in NFP before you dont get any results again for a while.
