Due to historical accident, my DSL POP is in Seattle while I'm in Miami, so
I get 200ish ping times as well.  If this were Quake I'd care, but EQ is
built such that pings don't matter much until they get into the several
thousand, so I've never bothered to get it switched over.  As long as I get
the bandwidth and the packet loss numbers stay at 0 (packet loss is what
everyone in EQ calls "lag", anyway), I'm happy.
