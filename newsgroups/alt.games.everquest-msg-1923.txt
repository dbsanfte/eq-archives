LOL! 

Too late. He's already hosed his faction with RegularsOfTheNewsgroup,
but probably managed to raise it with UsenetTrollsII. At this point, I
know that I /con Dubious to him, but I am sure alot of others are
Scowling. He might do better by staying out of the zone for a while, or
at least try to do something to get his faction back. So far I haven't
seen him do either.
