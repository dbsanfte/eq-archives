This is awesome. I wrote twice to VI about a new group design over the past
year. I see many of my ideas, design and commands actually being used in
this new raid group feature (even the screenshot of the raid window is
actually nearly exactly what i described to them).

It's really really cool to see VI actually use their "designer comments"
section.
