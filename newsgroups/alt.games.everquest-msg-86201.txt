Have you ever tried getting to the AC in south ro if you're not a Druid?
It's bad enough now with the druids snagging the thing all the time, but at
least the fact that they have to multiquest it slows them down.  If it were
normally tradeable there'd be a furrow in the desert betweem East Commons
and South Ro with druids continually farming the AC and running off to sell
it.

I prefer to do quests myself, but I've had to give up on this one due to
other players, mainly druids who obviously don't need the ring anyway.
