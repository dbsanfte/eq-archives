But the point of the paradox doesn't hinge on *how* he did it. The fact 
that 'he did it' or 'he didn't do it' is sufficient for the paradox.

That's one hypothesis yes. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if God is 
limited by HUP too, perhaps that was the point, perhaps he wanted a 
universe he couldn't look into. Does that violate omni/... he just 
created something he couldn't 'know'. Now why couldn't an omnipotent God 
do that? :)

As you are already aware of the absurdity of that, I won't bother
