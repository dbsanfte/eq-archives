Casters get lots of utility spells, and a lot of power, in exchange
for their weak melee. But this is entirely irrelevant because having
a handful of `auto-bind' spots in major cities is only a tiny fraction
of the convenience bind anywhere casters get.

Ducky for you. You can still bind right outside the hunting area, and
gate to it, while a melee is running back from the nearest major town.
I reckon that's more than enough.

In a newbie zone? It certainly is. I've waited over half an hour in
queynos for a bind capable character to wander through. And it's
level 14 for the wis casters.

I don't have luclin, so I can't answer that. I have no idea how
convenient it is. I also stated that I *don't* support incursions
upon the class defining abilities of teleportation and evacuation.
