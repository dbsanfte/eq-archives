There are two main methods to mitigate pet push.
1) use 'low push' procs, i.e. not Spirit of Wind, or others that push
specifically to interupt casters.
2) position the pet in such a manner that it pushes mobs into a wall or
corner, rather than back towards adds or other places you don't want to be.

You might say this is down to the Beastlord, which in part it is, but it
also needs the co-operation of the puller and other melee's as well.

As a beast, one of my 'pet bitches' is that often push is not coming from
me, but from casters using stuns (which push)
