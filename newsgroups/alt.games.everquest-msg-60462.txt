speak to the guy in fuschia robe near the house between gnolls and orcs.
Then go under the isle (need EB or EB item) inside, in the center there is a
tower. there is a DE female NPC  named Deep (if you have a tracker with you
coz it s drk and underwater but not required) If you talked to the guy
outside (cannot remember his name) after u killed the PH, Lord will spawn. I
got it with friends (52 warr and 57 monk) easy and quick.
