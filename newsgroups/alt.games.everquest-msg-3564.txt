If true sense being tanking uber mobs and their half-uber friends, than 
I agree whole heartedly. But in this case, there are no other tanks 
except warriors, no other healers than clerics, and necros are not 
allowed to be in the same zone.
Outside of that, tanking in smaller raids (Antonican dragons, planes), 
monks still cut it, although it's getting more difficult of them. 
Tanking in an experience crunch group (nonstop flow of low to mid 
blues), monks are just fine. 
Warriors may be better once they get so much more hitpoints as to make 
the mana cost of CH efficient. But monks are still just as acceptable if 
not better for tanking purposes than paladins and SKs

Please don't be offended, but I do believe it's on the low side for a 
monk. At 51 I have (unbuffed) 950 ac. I'm still wearing all of the same 
equipment that I was wearing since level 35. The two exceptions are CoS 
and FBSS.
If I'm buffed by a shaman and a cleric, I can get to just under 1050. If 
I added planes equipment, some of the Velious stuff, and some heavier 
stuff from Kunark (that I can wear with 17 weight limit), I believe I 
would be able to go to 1100 unbuffed, without uberest stuff (no VP, no 
Sleepers Tomb, no rare drops from the top 10 encounters).
Then there's the defense cap
