First driver change I made was to the 2280 drivers. That fixed the fatal
error message and got me into the game, but the frame rates were
unplayable.  Then, following reccomendations here (which worked for some
other folks) I tried the latest and greatest ones. They had exactly the
same crap frame rate. Still unplayable. That's the only reason I tried
the 2183 from the archive. They are, thus far, the only ones that got me
back up to full speed. The ones EQ reccomends will "work", but I
wouldn't want to try to fight anything that way.

Update. Turned all the models back on and texture to high with these
drivers and was still going at full speed, so it looks like I'm in
business.
:-)

Had last night not been Valentines day (plans with my sweetie) I would
likely have already rebuilt all my hot keys, etc. and been back on
track. Well, a project for tonight.

See ya'll in Norrath.
