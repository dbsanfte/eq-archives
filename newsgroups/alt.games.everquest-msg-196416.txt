If people want easy, they'll do the standard outdoor, single pull,
zero danger outdoor zone grind to 65 with or without KEI, it just goes
a good bit faster. In that case, KEI = faster, not easier. 

Anyone that hunts in a zone where KEI makes a difference between
winning or loosing, a spot where KEI = easier would actually be
justified, probably won't be dependent on KEI anyway and even if they
are they'll still be a much better player than the other case, with or
without KEI.
