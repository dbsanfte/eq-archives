That was always the case.  They're talking about the new spells that were
put on PoK vendors for each class (Burning Arrow and Flaming Arrow for
Rangers).  I've no idea if these have been changed, since I bought PoP for
the new content and ease of transportation *shrug*.

Besides, you can't ding 61 without having PoP, so the spells from the
turnins would be useless anyway.
