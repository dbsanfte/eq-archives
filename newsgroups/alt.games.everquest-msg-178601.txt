The fishing skill thing is semi-normal. It's a tradeskill, so it isn't level
limited. I have a friend that took something like 10 hours for his last 10
skillups in fishing (think that's right). I think he wsa 45 hours total in
getting fishing to 200, and he has a 255 WIS.

In my testing, it appears that DEX is an available alternate for fishing
skillups (it is for tailoring too, as STR is for smithing). I've heard no
comfirmation of this, but I notice that I get much faster skillups when I
play Katta's (about a 90 DEX boost) than when I don't.

As for your speed - make sure that you having accidently got walk turned on
instead of run.
