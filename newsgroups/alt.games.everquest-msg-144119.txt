Great Divide is your play, barring any Luclin choices. (Never spent any
low level time there.) I'd be shocked if you couldn't regularly find a
group there as a cleric, though you may have to be patient for a bit.
The wolves and frosties are the right level for you, and you can start
building up CoV and Dorf faction, if that's the way you are going. I did
those levels there and it worked great. 

For a harder to get a group but more rewarding option, poke your nose
into Crystal Caverns, which is quite close by. You could really clean up
in there.

Are you in a guild? Usually be the mid thirties, clerics are getting
snapped up all over the place. Hard to picture you not getting groups if
you have any skills at the cleric trade at all.
