    I've heard a lot of people mock them for being "cartoonish". Personally,
I don't care too much. As long as a video game isn't so low-end that
suspension of disbelief is destroyed, isn't so high-end that the frame rate
is like a slide show, and has a few good "ooooh" things in it, it works for
me. I'm a lot more concerned about the content of the game.
