nor was vagina, so what's your point?

The situation as he describes clearly indicates that the description of
coward is completely apt.

Is "pussy" a synonym of "coward" in normal day speech?  Yes.

he most probably used it because it's a commonly used synonym for coward.

"Pussy" was an apt word to use in the situation.

You're making assumptions, so you're not proving anything with a
