Again, this will only be anecdotal evidence at best, but the faction
thing definitely seems to play into how *long* it takes a mob to aggro,
though whether or not it affects range I couldn't even hazard a guess.
I've had glaring mobs let me pass them by at close range on numerous
occasions where scowling ones would surely attack. However, as
mentioned, speed is a good thing, because if you stand around long
enough they will still attack.

Then again, sometimes the glaring ones come right after you too, so
perhaps it's all some cosmic crapshoot.
