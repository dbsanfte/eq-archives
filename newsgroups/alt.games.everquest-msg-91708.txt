She's a good nominee, but I think I'll have to give my vote
to the Avatar of Fear in Cazic-Thule.

He's level 38, the Widowmistress is 36.  But at the point I was
(reasonably) easily soloing the Widowmistress, I couldn't
yet *dream* of soloing the AoF.

Plus he gets bonus points for being really, really ugly.
