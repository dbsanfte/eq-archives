I'll put my magelo below, even at 65 I wouldn't be hitting 255 wis if
it weren't for augments. Drop those and the Tactian's Bulwart which is
a pretty recent upgrade from a rusty hero shield, and I'd be sitting
at around 230 Wis I think. 

As to the why, it's not a matter of not having wisdom gear to choose
from, it's that even these days the good ac/hitpoint/sta gear doesn't
have a lot of wisdom on it. At least until you get to the high end
raid gear, it's hard to have gear with everything on it.
