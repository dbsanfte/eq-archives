Actually, it rather meant travel was travel - you didn't play each day
with the same group of 4 people, you met folks who played your timezone
in an area and hunted with them generally until you got the wanderlust
again... moving on meant moving on. Next time you'd login at your new
location and get to know the locals. It was an immersive world, not
diablo.

Part of the immersion is that the barrier is there, that overcoming it
gives a sense of satisfaction, that visiting far away lands actually
entails visiting *far away lands*.

If everyone else is porting all over the shop the locals dont *exist*
for you to meet. The long arduous journey is meaningless. There is no
local community for you to get to know. Everyone else is playing
diablo and closing your eyes and pretending otherwise wont change that.

That consistent, localised, sectionalised world isnt just the game; the
zones, the npc's are just... filler. They're scenery. The *content* in
MMORPG's are the other players, the interesting people.
