General progression for guilds is Thurg Faction, then CoV (usually comes 
with thurg) while they're farming Thurg quest armor, then Kael after 
they've farmed the hell out of HoT.

If your guild isn't farming Kael quest armor drops, or killing Velious 
dragons, there's not a lot of reason for you to be on giant faction.  
Thurgadin has nicer quests you can start at a lower level anyway.
