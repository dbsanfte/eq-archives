Maybe I'm missing something, but how do you know he is casting a port?
Doesn't it go something like:

A_Druid_01 begins casting a spell.

(sometime later)

xxxx opens a mystic portal (or somesuch)
LOADING...PLEASE WAIT.

At what point there do you realize a port is being cast, and therefore that
you should run?  The real question would be, why did you agree to group with
him without any knowledge of why you would be doing so?
