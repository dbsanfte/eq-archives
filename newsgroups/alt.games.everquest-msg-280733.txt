I think you'll find that the vast majority of people will disagree with you
on this.  Particularly the ones that actually remember Luclin's release.

I've seen a fix posted for this.  It's a problem on your end.  I wish I
could point you to the fix, but it never was a problem for me so I didn't
bother remembering what the fix was.  I *think* it was something to do with
read-only files and/or a cluttered eqclient.ini.

They have not varied their rate of releasing expansions since the very first
one came out more than 5 years ago.  Every six months, regular as clockwork. 
They have delayed a couple by up to a month or so, but never abandoned the
two-expansions-per-year business plan.

You should use games which are as hardware demanding as examples then.  =)
I find EQ to crash about as often as Battlefield 2, WoW, Guild Wars, etc. 
Ok, Battlefield 2 a bit more often, but it's only had once patch so far.  =P

What's wrong with the map background?  Perhaps a more appropriate question,
is, you do realize it's just a text file that you can edit yourself, right? 
I couldn't tell you what the default map screen is supposed to look like...
