It will be fun to watch when Verant finally gets around to breaking
ShowEQ once and for all, and then a lot of people quit, because much of
the post 50 game is simply not playable in any sort of fun way without
a couple people on the raid with ShowEQ just to try to stay on top of
the game bugs.

Most interesting comment I've heard about Anarchy Online, from an EQ
player who occasionally uses ShowEQ: "You don't *need* ShowEQ in Anarchy
Online!".
