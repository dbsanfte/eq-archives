If you have a click on an NPC that isn't indifferent to you, you 
can tell if it worked by reconning after clicking hide.  If it
goes to indifferent, the hide worked.

And hide doesn't wear off.  It's a much safer way to take that quick
break from EQ than to cast camo and hope that it doesn't wear off
a few seconds after you leave the room.
