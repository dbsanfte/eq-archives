Only way to know that is to check.  It varies by server to server.   On
E'ci, there are public and semi-public arena raid / armor farms that you
would probably be able to join.  I'm not sure if Prexus has anything
similar.

With that group, not a chance.  The Protectors of Zek, which have the best
chances of dropping armor, are level 58.  Veterans, which drop it decently,
are high 50's...  around 56 or so.  Most will enrage prior to death.

A good, balanced group of 55 - 60 can do parts of the arena that drop armor.
(I think even they would choke on the PoZ's)  Mostly though, you're looking
at multi group armor farming "raids."

And I'd be wary of any armor farming raid that suggests taking on the
Vindicator ; )  I wasn't entirely serious about farming him : P  (Although
some bastages can do him with 18 people and only 3 (botted) clerics, he'll
usually hand multiple groups of level 60's their collective asses.)



With the group you listed, you *might* be able to do the bank area, which
drops armor very, very, very rarely.
