I agree, if you look at the world from a spiritual point of view, then God
has obviously lifted his blanket of protection from the earth and those who
do not know God will begin to act in ways approaching animals as Satan now
has full control over the Earth. Satan is supposed to have control for 7
years, I believe it began at the beginning of this year as my eyes were
opened to it, I believe on the 31st. I don't see any reason to doubt that
Satan now has full control over the earth and that God will begin to punish
the whole world except the people who believe in him and are able to see the
deception for what it is and are able to avoid it. I also see no reason to
doubt that as the world slides into decay it will find a scapegoat, and the
scapegoat will be Christians, which in my opinion are the one dim light in
this world, that is the ultimate rebellion against God, and the ultimate
proof of the fallibility of man, and his refusal to recognize truth for
folly.
