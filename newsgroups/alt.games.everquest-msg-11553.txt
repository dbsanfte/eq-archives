The one GM event I got to take part in happened in West Commons.  I was
playing my Wizard (43rd at the time).  The GM was playing a human female
saying a fish had come up out of the water and nabbed a ring off her finger.
She said I was probably too powerful to kill the fish (it had some sort of
protection).  I tried anyway and of course the fish was immune to me.  So I
pulled on my 20th level monk and proceeded to try and kill the fish and
found there were actualy three and nearly died.  Found some higher levels in
zone to help buff me and keep me alive and I fought all three and killed
them.  I gave her the ring and received a fish bone earring for my troubles
and the people that helped me got some minor items.  All in all it was
pretty fun.
