Last night I got to camp the Druids near the WC Druid Ring, and an
interesting glitch came up. The Merchant in the ring fought off a
couple of Griffins, but in the course of the fight she got pulled out
of position.

For almost three HOURS she was stuck inside one of the pillars that
make up the ring - and was telling everyone that she was
'unavailable'. Someone eventually did get her out of the rock by
attacking her, but she then just stood there (still unavailable) for
about half an hour until a GM finally answered my petition (which had
been sent two hours earlier).

Even this GM admitted that this has happened lots of times. Why has
this glitch never been fixed?
