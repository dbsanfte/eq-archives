At that level there's no difference between a warrior and a ranger's
dps given equal weapons. If the ranger was snaring as early as he
could have maybe he could have gotten more aggro, but at that level
its not really significant.

The guy sounded like a prick, but honestly, in a group like yours in
the upper two rooms of HHK basement, if he was severely twinked he may
have simply not cared whether or not he was behind the mob simply
because it may not have mattered. At lowbie levels sometimes niceties
like assisting and aggro management become far less important when
highly twinked people are involved.
