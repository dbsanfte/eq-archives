Hi,
Well I tried EQ for a while last year, lasted about 1 week or 10 days till I
cancelled my account and went on to other games.

But I've been interested in trying again, but I'd rather not have the
experience that I had prior.

Basically prior, I spent the 7 to 10 days hunting bats and bugs, and got
bored real fast, I had no money to speak of, so I couldnt go out and get any
armor type stuff, I seemed to be stuck in the bat and bug hell.  So B4 I do
that again, can anyone tell me some great starting tips for someone that is
just making a character and ready to start playing.

Such as, what server should I play in, which seems to have the most friendly
players, players that like to interact with each other instead of screaming
out that they have something to sell all the time.  What type of character
should I be for my 1st character? etc. etc. etc.

Thanks,
Adam
