Hello.

I'm a natural hoarder and bank things with the flag No Drop in case it's required for
a quest.
This has worked out fine in some cases, as I've actually collected stuff that's class
specific.
Trouble is, I am badly in need of bank space because I've got items that I can't find
a use for.
Allakhazam being my main reference, I can't find any info for these items and they
remain a mystery to me.

Has anybody an idea what these items are for?

Signet Ring - from ToFS in IC.
Sonic Wolf Molar  -from HSMoor (I think).
Vampyre Blood and Vampyre Ashes - from ME.
Thought Leech Brain - from Mons Letalis.
Mark if Battle - from Mons Letalis (other Marks too).
Triple Headed Circlet - also Mons Letals.
Solstice Rune - No idea of location.

Also, if anyone plays on Rallos I might consider MQing ;-)~ Like the Grizzleknot Bark
in my bank if any Shaman wants it for Totemic.

Thanks.

Ps. Need the KC and Chardok pipes, c'mon help the puller - he takes all the Harm
Touches ;-)~ and I haven't got the 5kpp for each of them. Even better message me and
come help me get 'em.
Out.
