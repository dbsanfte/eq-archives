The process is much easier if you can get a friend in a pet class you help
you.  They will need to put the pet on guard which will cause it to face the
trap.  Then you walk in the direction the pet is looking until the Death
Squad appears and threatens to stomp you to little bits.

I did this myself and helped a friend and he never spawned on the ramp
itself, but at the top, quite way to the left or right of the beginning of
the ramp.
