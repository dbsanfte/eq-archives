A few times, actually. It's not that I play too much (I play for maybe 3 hours
a day on the days that I *do* play) it's more that dealing with the
holier-than-thou crowd, and the ones that are just assholes, period.
When those times come around, I just throw myself into a painting or rearrange
the house or clean until my arms fall off. (Cleaning is an excellent way to
blow off steam after you've lost a level because you went LD and some asswiped
trained you or whatever)
At least you're taking a reasonable approach to being burned out =) Have fun on
your EQ vacation!
