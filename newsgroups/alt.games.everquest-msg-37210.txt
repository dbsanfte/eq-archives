    "U want plats to play? Ur GREEDY!" You wouldn't believe how many folks
assume that clerics are making some secret horde of cash on compensation
loot for Symbols, and on resses. You're a druid, you should know the answer
to this - do you make more cash porting folks around, or farming items/Rathe
Mountains? Now, which one of those two choices (cash for services, pharming)
is NOT terribly viable for the "Root and Nuke to 60" class?

    Key word, should. The people that do this for a cleric are rarer than
you'd think. Stupid thing is, they think our memory is as short as theirs,
and bitch the loudest when I won't cross space and time to res them.

    Personally, I love asking for things like this. Where my downtime and
hassle is exactly equal to yours, no cash traded. When I was lower level I'd
ask the PC I'd ressed to teach me his native tongue to Excellent. I'm
guessing learning languages is entirely based off of INT, because I've
always been a slow learner. The person I've ressed begins to appreciate what
a person's time means to them better when they have to allocate a specific
time slot to repaying me, as opposed to just handing me X plat they got who
knows when.
And I can read new scrolls! ;-)
