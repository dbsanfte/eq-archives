Oh no! it's a 'gateway' game! It leads to other games! Alert Nancy Reagan!

As I recall, the primary difference was what hardware they'd support.  
There were 15 million different card thingys you could stick in a Windows 
box, and with a mac, you could hook up a printer.  If you needed to run 
complex scientific equipment, or any of a dozen other things, Windows was 
your platform.  Windows could even do 16-color graphics!  Ooooh.  
Actually, that was more like 1982 or 3 I think, but that's where I'd say 
the momentum came from.
