Well, that's more a fault with the technology of single-table
databases than anything. No matter what, when you're showing that much
data arranged in that format on a small screen, it's not going to be
an optimal experience. But the tables are small and free. 

I too like dedicated applications for databases (such as Herbal Zone,
which is excellent), but they cost time and money to make.

When I first got my Vx a year ago, I figured it'd just be a toy sort
of purchase. To my surprise, I really used it, a lot. Hence my upgrade
to an m505. 

In addition to the built-in apps, I use lots of other stuff, including
Herbal Zone, Documents to Go (for editing my stuff when I'm not at my
Big Computer), Palm Reader (ebooks, docs, etc), MobileDB Lite, Avant
Go, and PhotoSuite (probably even more now that Handy mentioned
loading EQ maps). And since I'm a geek, I replaced the shell with
MegaLauncher, and I use the Filez util a lot. Oh, and games. Lots of
games. Especially SimCity and Space Trader.

Like I say, I use the thing all the time. Last week while waiting for
someone I was meeting, I outlined most of a major proposal for a
client on my Palm. And I didn't even have my spiffy folding portable
keyboard with me :)
