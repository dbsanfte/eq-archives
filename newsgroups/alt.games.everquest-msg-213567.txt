"They changed the Graphic on this thing.  Now it looks gimped like a
Broads sword. Wide hild large base then straight edge to a v point.
Stupid looks compaired to the old on in the pickture. I got this sword
in the bazaar cuz of the stats but the new look is so bad that i may
look for another sword. When SOE changes crap without letting us know
thats what pisses me off. Any way. I hope i was just buged and it will
be back to normal when i log in tonight. But if not i'll take a SS and
send it in."

English probably not his first language. :-p
