I like the graveyards, others argue they have removed another element of 
risk from the game.  I can understand that argument, but I enjoy being 
able to explore a bit, with a lower risk, so I like them.

PoP mobs are harder than any other mobs in the game, on a level per 
level comparison, as I understand it.  They hit harder and faster, and 
they have more hitpoints.  The mobs in PoJ can be fought without a 
slower, and it's not too hard, the mobs in PoI, PoN and PoD are *very* 
hard if you can't slow them.

Having said that, there are other sections to PoJ with much harder mobs, 
just you don't tend to see them at the exit camps, unless someone's 
dragged them a fair distance.  I understand the bugs in the hidden 
tunnels are quite tough.

That's the primary entry point, and the only way into the rest of PoJ. 
Some people pull the jailed mobs into the courtyard by warping them 
through the wall, but since the zone exit is somewhere else, there are 
very very rarely any trains in the courtyard itself.

The mobs in the main are in PoJ are non-KOS (unless you're in wolf 
form).  They will assist though (unless you're level 57+ I believe, in 
which case you can single pull most of them, apart from that damn Monk 
who _always_ assists).

When you get to the enforcers in PoJ, they do aggro, and they are harder 
than the jailed mobs.

There aren't 40 other 65th level characters in my guild with which we 
could raid and defeat the mobs required to get flagged, and there aren't 
ever going to be that many, because we're not a raiding guild.

So no, I don't think I'm exaggerating.

The 'original' planes are still there, Fear, Hate, Sky (air), Mischief, 
Growth, and are all entry restricted to 46th level +

Some have regular zone ins, and others require wizard ports.  I visited 
Sky 6 times yesterday, and never tire of jumping off to zone out, and 
landing in Freeport.

Indeed, although the PoP stuff is tough to access, I find LoY and LDoN 
content has added an immense amount of pleasure to my game.  I enjoyed 
the LoY zones and the new tinkering recipes, and I find LDoN suits my 
style of play when I want to do that.

The PoP expansion for me has been the least accessable generally, but 
that's because my highest level character wasn't able to get into it 
when it came out, and I'm not in a high-end raiding-guild.
