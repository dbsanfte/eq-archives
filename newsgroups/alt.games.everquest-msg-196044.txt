Because its a intro raid to teach others raid ettiquete, you'll
probably want to go somewhere thats easy to get to, thats not too hard
yet offer some challenge and offer a reasonable chance for a
successful raid.

SolA might just be the place you want to go. Its easy to get to, its
not that hard - yet has a variety of mobs (casters and non casters).
Because the goblins are very social it should promote the concept of
teamwork. Also, its an old world zone, so those that attend that may
not have the best systems wont be crippled by complex zone geometry.
It also offers serveral spots to camp as well as a great dungeon
crawl. It offers some decent drops for non twinks as well.
