Yet another reason for God not to bother with palor tricks. People
would still reject him as God... Foxeye here clearly limits her
recognition of his status to being the "talking fish guy".

Spontaneous creation is equally amazing as Divine Creation. 

Neither answer is better, both presuppose amazing things. 

Spontaneous Creation presupposes that absolute nothingness contains
the potential to spontaneously spark well... everything. 

Believing this leaves one open to the possibility that the near
vaccuum between here and Mars could spontaneously spit up a new
planet, complete with a civilization of talking fish. After all, if we
are prepared to accept entire universes popping up out of the void
uncalled surely a mere planet isn't the greater stretch. 

Divine Creation only presupposes a God.
