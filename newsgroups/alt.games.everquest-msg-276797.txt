The base question is two-part.  The first is what I'm more interested
in:  What memories, if any, do you have of your lower-level days
(1-30)?  I started just after kunark was released and still very much
remember how i felt at those low levels. i can still remember how i felt
running from qeynos to freeport at lvl 6 with my ranger. it was something
that i will prolly never forget. tho that account is gone and i have just
started again. i am getting to experiance alot that all over again with my
now lvl 10 monk


The second is also of interest, but slightly less so: Did you
find yourself advancing at a leisurely pace, taking time to explore
everything as thoroughly as your abilities would allow as areas became
more and more accessible, or did you find yourself going after
everything you could tackle to get to the highest level available as
fast as possible? with my rangers tracking working i used to run everywhere.
hell i swam through cabilis one day to help a buddy get his corpse back in
the tower at FoB. i wanted to see it all tho i had no buisness being
anywhere near where i was.
