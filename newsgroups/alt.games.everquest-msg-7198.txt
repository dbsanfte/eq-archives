Oh, totally agreed that it's *too easy* and in Verant's vision would
need to be changed.  My question, perhaps poorly phrased without coffee
this morning, was, would it be an "*exploit*"?
  If somebody has that porting capability and goes and buys thousands of
the shark foods and turns them all in instead of hunting them, do you
see that as something that Verant would be suspending accounts over?
