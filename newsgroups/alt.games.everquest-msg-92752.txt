But the company runs on a series of fixed costs.  Machines will be covered via
insurance and service contracts.

"Server class"  what is server class?

Talking out my ass, that's funny.  Actually I HAVE installed numerous high
speed lines for my clients, and they cost no where in the vicinity of what you
are suggesting.  The more bandwidth you buy, the cheaper it gets.  If I know
the cost of one T3 line, I think I can do basic math to figure out the cost of

15K  LOL.  Remind me to sell you a server sometime ok friend?  First, we have
no idea on how many servers they require.  Second, these machines would be on
leases, not bought outright.  Again, the more machines you get on a lease, the
cheaper the lease rate.

Also, no server is 15 - 20 thousand dollars no a days.

But then, you'd know that, right?

Oh man, you're killing me.  Do you think they buy their routers at Business
Depot?  Call Cisco and tell them you want a few HUNDRED routers and see what
kind of pricing they can give you.

This is why you aren't in business.

First, no customer service rep/hr rep for a company is going to earn 50K USD. 
You higher college kids who are going to earn maybe 25K each, people can work
cheap when the economy tanks.

20 mil.... oh man.

Do you even understand how lines of credit work?  They don't have to be paid
off until (typically) the end of the month.  If you have 4 million in CASH and
have it invested properly, you are going to earn FAR more than what the
bank/loaner will charge you in interest.

You're missing my point.  VI stated this card was SUPPORTED, yet, for months
they didn't attempt to fix the problem.  When programming, you sit down and
define which bugs are crippling bugs, and which are simply cosmetic.

Cosemetic bugs, or bugs that do NOT lead to instabilities are low priority. 
This is a programming first.  Bugs that cause corruption, memory leaks, or bugs
that simply cause programs NOT to run are first priority.  But of course, if
you were a programmer, you'd know this too right?

Wow, you can really read into stuff.  Can you read my palm too?  Maybe my mind?

Wrong again friend.  But when problems do crop up, I have the brains to figure
out which ones are priorities and which ones are of little significance.

If my client can't log into their Win2K TS on the road, and one has a problem
with corrupt desktop icons.... do I tackle the icon problem first?

Again, thank god you aren't a progammer (and if you are, you obviously aren't a
very good one).  Small gains are unimportant.  If a freaking gnome isn't
sitting properly, and we have a bug that is not letting say, 50,000 paying
customers log in, it should require little brain power to figure out which one
should be addressed first.

Again, this comes back to my poor customer service issue.

Yes, I'm sure that's what it was.

Tough week.... heh.  I guess they just exhausted themselves trying to fix the
bard songs, LD issues, and ATI graphic problems huh?
