Saw these two once from a safe distance around level 50 and noticed
they were in my level range. I might go back and hunt them some day,
so I would appreciate anything you can tell me about them.

I know they are on Cabilis Legion faction and they can poison you.
Anyone know more? Are they Warriors, Monks, SK? How tough are their
resists?
