I've been reading this thread and have been wanting to say why I always
pictures rangers using bows...  but now I realize my reason is really silly... 
:)  I honestly had no clue that they were for close-range fighting however...  


For me, when I think of Ranger, I think of Robin Hood.  When I think of Robin
Hood, I think of a bow.  That's just me though and my reasoning for thinking
the primary dps from a Ranger should be his bow...  

Maybe Ranger should be further broken down into 'Archer' or 'Swordsman'...

I dunno...  but I am enjoying this debate.  :)
