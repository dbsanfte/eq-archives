Please for the love of god stop calling yourself or any of your little
friends hackers.  Hackers infiltrate to learn and nothing more.  If
you want a term, the word Sploiter (short for exploiter) would apply,
as all you are doing is exploiting the game mechanics to produce
unintended results.  It has nothing to do with the pursuit of
knowledge, or truth, or sticking it to the man.  What your group does
is find ways to play a game outside the normal boundaries of said
game, and gets paid for it.

Now that I'm done with that, I dont personally care about exploits as
they are not really affecting the average gamer on any level other
than perhaps mob scarcity.  That particular problem, as was said
before, is a function of pre-programmed crappily long spawn times, not
you guys.

In closing, have fun, and please try to be accurate.
