Create a Dwarf.  Let's say the Dwarf is named Y, and your Iksar is named X.
Bring the Dward to Firona Vie.  (I picked Dwarf, because I think that is the
easiest to get to FV).  Find the Iksar corpse, and camp.

Log into the Iksar, and type "/consent Y".  The log out, and log into the
Dwarf.  The Dwarf can target the corpse and type "/corpse" to drag it.  Drag
it to a place that is safe for the Iksar.
