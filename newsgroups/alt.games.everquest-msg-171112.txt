My favorite is a SK, Enchanter, Cleric.  Course my SK is well
equipped.  A warrior would be a good substitute.  I like the SK
because the darkness keeps the pulls from running.  The Enc can speed
you up, slow the mob, and even put a small DS on the SK.  THe SK gets
Cleric buffs and heals of course.  Use the HoT spells versus the
instant heals to keep aggro low on the cleric.  Enc throws in a
clarity and its a wonderful thing.

That's my usual group.  But I'm sure others have had good
alternatives.

Good luck.  Nothing beats hanging with a group you know and trust.
