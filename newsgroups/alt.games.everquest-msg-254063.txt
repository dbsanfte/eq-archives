Actually I find this to be completely backwards. Throw skill points
into your weapon skill early when it can really make a difference. I
have tried both putting my first five in my weapon skill and not doing
it and the difference is amazing. It's the *early* levels when skills
have trouble going up; later on they are pitifully easy to raise.

So I heartily advise the OP to *not* follow this advice.
