This thing happen when you "die" while zoning. Only thing you loose normally is
your buffs. Happended to me twice.
I remember about 2 years and a half ago, when eq was still young, i used to die
alot zoning (SG's beating on me mostly) . We didnt have that "feature" (dont
know if they implemented that thing later in a patch or if its a bug) back then
and we could die easily while zoning and low on health. Doesnt seem to be the
same anymore, as soon as you zone, youre safe..at least thats what ive been
experiencing since i came back to the game.
