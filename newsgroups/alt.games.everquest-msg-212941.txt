You brought the response upon yourself.  You need to get a clue.  It's
rather obvious that you are nothing but a troll, trying to get a rise out of
DT seems to be your raison d'etre.

He at least was willing to almost try to find the link, most would just say
"Stop being a lazy fuck and look it up in the Dev Corner, you immature
prick".   Of course, I wouldn't even say that, normally.  I would be dubious
of your ability to comprehend the instructions.
