Nope. Dwarves have no racial hatred towards Humans. The only races that 
have racial hatred towards Humans are Ogres, Trolls, Iksar, and to a 
slightly lesser extent, Dark Elves. And if I'm not mistaken, Dwarven 
Warriors can also follow Rallos Zek, so it can't be bacause of your god.

Are you sure you didn't accidentally attack one? And are you sure that you 
picked Rallos and not an evil god, like Innoruuk, for example?
