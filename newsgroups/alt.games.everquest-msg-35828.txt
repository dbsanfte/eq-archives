The thing that makes 30, 35, 40, and 45 hell levels is that they are
significantly harder than both the previous *AND* the following level.
They take longer to get through than the previous level, and they
cause the following level to have a death penalty that takes a lot
more blue bubbles than normal.

Post 50, only 59 is like that.  Here's the XP requirements for a human
cleric for 39-60, rounding to the nearest million:

39	 5
40	12 <-- hell
41	 6
42	 7
43	 7
44	 7
45	17 <-- hell
46	 9
47	 9
48	 9
49	10
50	10
51	24 <-- permanent increase in hardness
52	26
53	28
54	46 <-- permanent increase in hardness
55	50
56	55
57	59
58	64
59	89 <-- hell
60	53 <-- heaven
