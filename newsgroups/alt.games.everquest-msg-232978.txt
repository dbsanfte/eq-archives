Interesting. Didn't have the lag issues you described yesterday
myself, and my computer's crap. ;p

Of course, my computer's always been notorious about not knowing the
limits of its capabilities. 600Mhz P3, usually has 384 RAM (Down to
256 right now until I can replace the motherboard. It was at this
yesterday, by the way), GeForce 2 MX/MX400. It ran Horizons,
Planetside, and Shadowbane all playably (Sure, there was some lag, but
nothing that made the games a pain to play). FF XI's benchmark program
shows that I can even run it if I ever get a masochistic streak (The
very high end of their "easy prey" playable category).
