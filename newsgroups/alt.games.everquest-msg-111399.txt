Hard drive thrashing is down to swap file usage.

Turn off all models, mipmapping etc. and enable the caching. Also make sure
you have at least 150mbs hard drive free space and defrag the drive if you
haven't done so.

In the game do a /serverfilter on and turn off any text you don't need at
the time such as auctions , shouts and ooc in spam zones like LOIO

The 44.4kbps connection is not a problem as the game will run at 28.8 but if
your modem is a winmodem then a lot of your processor will be taken up by it
and will cause problems.

Try to upgrade your processor and ram. 512mb ram would be sufficient and
will cut down on a lot of the HD access. You don't say what gfx card you
use.

Before loading the game, ensure you have no other programs running.
