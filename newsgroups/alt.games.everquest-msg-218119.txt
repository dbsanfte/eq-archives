So you want a single group game with a global chat interface built
around it. Gotcha.

Think about non sequitur. Today's mmorpgs aren't heroic fantasy. LDoN
isn't heroic fantasy either. It is, in fact, even further from it than
before.

They have nothing to do with roleplaying and everything to do with the
laziness of the current playerbase, not willing to have to spend the
effort to go to any place out of the way because it might affect their
experience efficiency.

The fact is, pretty close to the same sort of thing as ldon offers now
in terms of dungeon crawling was available before... but it wasn't
convenient enough for today's population of "I want everything *now*"
players.
