I, totally agree, I'm a newbie to EverQuest..  Only 3 weesks into the
playing of it so far have a lvl 6 high elf cleric and a lvl 6 wood elf bard.
I've worked hard to gain what I've gotten so far, NEVER once begged anyone
for anything or even asked for anything.  I've had things just handed to me
on the fly and I've had people come up and inspect me and say.. come to the
bank with me and just hand me things...but, I've never begged and will never
beg for PP's or equipment.  I've asked for help in locating a corspe and be
offered help by Bards that went above helping me find the corspe by staying
with me and battleing off orc centurions while I looted myself and in one
case my friend looted his corspe after repeatedly dieing while trying to
just make it back from orc hill as newbie ranger who wandered off in the
dark and got turned around and lost all sense of direction (this skill not
yet working very good lol )
I have been up front in asking people for help, in telling them I can give
you bone chips, bat wings, or whatever might help you..but i've not much in
pp's yet.

All in all, I've had newer newbies approach me begging for pp's where I've
had to work so hard to get what I have, I've been kind, helped a few out
with 1 or two but I've come to the conclusion.. enough is enough I can't
help the entire EQ newbie popluation.. my suggestion is.. do what i have had
to to.. Go Out.. Kill!..hunt!...even the minor things that no longer give
EXP.  get the bone chips.. bat wings.. spiderling webs.. wasp wings.. SELL
them .. many people are shouting looking for them.. not the easiest way to
get rich..but I've managed a bit doing this..

Sorry for the long ramble..   Kea
