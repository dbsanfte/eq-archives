Even worse than bards, Vah Shir find cat references almost impossible
to avoid.  Mine is perhaps more obscure than most, but my original
Vah was named Llyran for the Niven/Star Trek race, (more well known
to Star Fleet Battles players than to SF fans in general) and I immediately
knew that if I ever ran a Vah Bard he'd be named LLyric as a combination
of the two.  Even had my last blank character slot filled with a dummy
level one bard of that name for a while just to "hold" it.

I still have the urge to make his last name al'Poet but so far I've
successfully
resisted.
