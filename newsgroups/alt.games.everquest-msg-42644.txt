ok so today in unrest i came across a mob that i accidently targeted called
the herald of mischeif. it didnt aggro or anything and i couldn't see it but
i could hail it. i was curious so i asked a few other players to assist me
and con it it conned red to everyone except a level 58  player with who it
conned blue. like i said there was no aggro and no body but i could hail it
and everyone conned it. i had never heard of such a mob and was wondering
what it was. also after some looking i found a mystic portal that when you
givve something to it i gives it back saying 9 thank you so-and-so but i do
not need this) i was wondering if anyone had info on that.
again i had never heard of these mobs and am very curious
