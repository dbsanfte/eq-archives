I don't see any conflict anywhere... Perhaps you misread it? I don't
know if you have ever played an Enchanter, but Mesmerize has a memory
blur component. It could conceivably be used to stop a fight between a
wolf or a bear, and someone who either got jumped, or attacked them and
got in too deep. It would be easier than my current policy of simply
healing them and telling them to run.

Well, thank you very fucking much for telling me how to roleplay my
character. Should I start sending you my logs for approval on a weekly
basis?

I'm sure that if there was no faction loss involved you'd be happy to
kill Treants too. Well, something for you to chew on: I don't kill
anything that appears intelligent and is indifferent to me. I don't hunt
Aviaks, Centaurs, Tizmaks, Guk Frogloks or the like. And I may only be
level 33, but I'm sure I have got as much enjoyment out of every hour
I've played EQ as you have.
