> Why can't I melee worth anything?

  Because you have substantial nukes and DoTs that makes up for your
lack of damage output in melee and the ability, and through rooting,
snaring or some combination of the two you can more easily avoid
damage through melee than any melee class.  I fail to see how any of
this has anything to do with binding and the death mechanics, though.

  I don't really care if hybrids or non-casters get a Bind Affinity
spell or ability or not.  I just don't see the point in not allowing
them to be bound in the same places as casters.
