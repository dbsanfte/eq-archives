Ditto.  I really miss those times.

I got Blackstar, the ultimate Dark nuke.  I immediately slotted a 41 Damage 
enhancement and tested it in a mission I was doing with my supergroup.  I 
blasted a large group of werewolfs for... 10 points of damage!  I also 
debuffed their ACC, which is not insignificant.  Also the mobs were much 
higher level than I was.  And again also, when I can add more Damage slots 
it'll be more impressive.

Still, Blackstar is a lot like the cleric nukes - amusing, but ultimately 
mostly useless.
