Do you know for a FACT that is what would happen in any future terrorist
attack? Of course not. You are simply doom saying, worse than you claim I
am. You are telling everyone there is no hope if you get attacked
whatsoever... I am telling people that is not the case, that circumstances
are dire, but you can atleast try as many substances are NOT modern nerve
agents. And IN FACT, the ones they would most likely have access to are
simply potent incecticides... And even if you are right, I died with knowing
I did everything I could to try and give my family a chance. You simply have
already given into the fact you have no hope. I am sorry for you.

This is not inefective, only in your opinion. You certainly don't make a
very good case for your opinions.
