I've tried a google search on eqclient.ini, and haven't found an answer for
this particular question out there.  I'd like to default to half-screen mode
on startup.  There's a setting in eqclient.ini that reads:

ScreenMode=NORMAL

I'm assuming that this is what I need to change, but have no idea what value
to give it.  Any clues?

Many thanks in advance.
