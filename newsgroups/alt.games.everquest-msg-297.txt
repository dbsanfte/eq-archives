  Pretty much any class will be more than welcome in a group if you play
your class well, and have a good reputation.  If you don't play your
class well, or have an attitude, then even if you play one of the most
sought after classes (clerics, enchanters,) then you will not find
yourself welcome in many groups for long... especially with those
classes, in fact, because if they do their job poorly, the group is
dead.
  Necromancers are an all-around powerful class.  They are not the most
group-friendly class, but if you know how to keep your pet under control
(crucial in dungeons) then a necromancer is usually a nice asset to most
groups.
  Wizards are group friendly, probably moreso than necromancers and
magicians, and their job is not as difficult as that of an enchanter's. 
Wizards aren't really good soloers, at least not compared to
necromancers, so if you're willing to give up most of your soloing
capability to be more group-friendly, then go for it.  Wizards are an
excellent asset to a group, providing they know what they're doing (know
how hard to nuke, when to nuke, and when to evac.)
  Your other option, if you are stuck on being an intelligence caster,
would be to be a magician, but I personally rate magicians on about the
same level as necromancers when it comes to group-friendliness...
perhaps a little friendlier.  The difference between the two classes in
this respect, is small enough, in my opinion, that it isn't worth
changing your class over.  They are both pet classes whose main
contribution to a group is dealing out a massive amount of damage over
time, with other miscellaneous abilities to boot.
