I suppose.  sneak doesn't seem to work very well for mobs above 50 but
perhaps he won't be agro at all.  I've heard that he isn't to us even
though the rest ot the zone is.  I don't belong to an uber guild and
from what I've heard fighting one's way in is the only way to get in.
I've read countless postings from monks talking about how many times
they died there because of so many casters.  shudder....

thanks for the info.

Robert
