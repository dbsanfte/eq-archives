The roleplay server was not out at the beginning...

Role-playing enhances the enjoyment cossiderably, it takes a little more
thought, but not enough to warrent making the game un enjoyable.

How can you read a good book if you don't get into the characters?

A refference of a book or movie would be nice as in all the movies or book's
that I have read I have never seen a Good character heal an Orc, or a Troll?
There are not many clerics in the game that never do harm to other beings
NPC's for example... But I do agree for the most part.

IMO this was intended to add to the depth of the game. Again no roleplay
servers where setup at the beginning.

See above It takes little time to roleplay and can only enhace the game
experiance.

This is not grifeing, and any report would go no farther then the Trash

I read this as saying that those who wish to role play are not allowed and
must conform to he who does not wish to roleplay?
Which does nothing but turn it in the oppisite direction from (Role-player
to non Role-player) to (non Role-player to Role-player).

Agreed but, why would they go through the hassel of putting the mechanics in
place if not intended to be used ?

I meant the world, not the rights. I.E. We can change the nature of , and
