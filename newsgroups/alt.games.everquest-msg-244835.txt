I'm using version 2.5 of the software and I can't find the auto repeat
option anywhere? I tried searching in the help files on repeat and all i can
find is the "repeat while button held down" command, which is kinda
defeating the purpose! I've had a look at their web site, tried searching
with google, and I am truly flummoxed.

Can you please help?
