Everyone is the first few times, don't worry about it.

Except it isn't usually one group fighting, it is one group who has the 
main assist that everyone is assisting, or everyone is helping out the 
group keeping aggro by healing the MA etc. This is really just to clear a 
path through mobs in a set order, if every group just did their own thing 
they'd be aggro mobs running around all over the place and the raid would 
probably wipe out.

The raid leader will usually allot groups and tell group leaders what they 
should be doing. e.g. you might have a shaman and enchanter in one group 
and be told to debuffing and crowd control, you might have 6 enchanters in 
a group and be told to do nothing except stand there and mana-sieve this 
complete-healing mob. If you're not sure what you're doing tell your group, 
your group leader should be able to tell you and if he's unsure he should 
be in contact with the raid leader.

Theres a few links to zone guides at SCARAB (Society for Cooperative Allied  
Raids on Antonius Bayle). They are mainly for high-end zones - planes, 
dragons, the hole, etc, but maybe something useful is buried there.
