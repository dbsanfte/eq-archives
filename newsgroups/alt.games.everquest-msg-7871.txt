I agree with you.  I think that if they are using the monthly fees to
maintain the servers, then the logic follows that once you have paid the up
front cost you should have access to all their games from the same account.
I realize that some will not see this, but I would be much more incline to
purchase another game from them, if I could use the same base account to
play.
