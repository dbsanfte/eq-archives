DE Guards in OT are on a faction that is KoS to any "good-only" race, "good-only"
classes (most notably Paladins), and worshippers of "good" gods. Anything else, like
say a Human Agnostic Monk, would be indifferent, but I don't think anything is better
than indifferent, no even DE's of any sort (not sure on that one though).
