The third isn't useless in a dungeon.  E.g., fall down the pit in
Blackburrow, and die while trying to run out, and that third numbers is very
useful when you are later standing at the right N/S and E/W position and
don't see your body anywhere.

Now that they have an on-screen compass, sense heading is very worthwhile.
Sense heading affects the compass in two ways:

1. The higher the sense heading skill, the more steady the compass is.  At
low sense heading, the compass randomly swings around a large amount, so you
have to watch it for quite a while to figure out what your heading is.  As
sense heading goes up, the range of that variation goes way down.  My main's
sense heading is 200, and there is no variation at all.

2. Whenever you use the sense heading skill, and get a success, the compass
stops swinging for a few seconds.  This gives you an exact heading, and, for
that few seconds, it tracks your heading changes.

Here's an easy way to quickly max sense heading.  Put sense heading all by
itself on hotkey 9 or 0 (or both).  Go to the keyboard configuration menu,
and select the hotkey configuration, and for hotkey 9, select the same key you
use for "turn left".  For hotkey 0 (if you did both), select the same key you
use for "turn right".  The turn keys will then both turn you, and try to do
a sense heading.

My Halfling Cleric, now level 17, usually has sense heading maxed for his
level within a few minutes of dinging now.  With max sense heading at level
16, he was getting enough successes that the compass was basically steady
all the time while traveling.  After around level 11 or so, successes are
frequent enough that the compass is very useful.

One thing to watch out for, if you use the hotkey method: that applies to all
characters.  My main has sense heading maxed, so has no need to have it
bound to any key, since the compass is perfectly steady for him, so hotkey 
9 and 0 are used to access some inventory slots.  It would be unfortunate if
I forgot the turn right activited hotkey 0, which happened to be my Staff of
Temperate Flux.
