This is a known problem with VIA chipset motherboards (knowns as the
"nVidia infinite loop crash").

VIA has a patch available that appears to give some measure of
stability with this crash (www.viaarena.com).

However, the fix only supports some of the chipsets which are
reporting this problem.

If your MB is not one of the supported chipsets, what appears to work
is to slow down your AGP a bit through the BIOS.  This gives more
stability, but doesn't completely remove the problem (also makes your
graphics subsystem slightly slower).
