With the way insurance premiums are going at the moment, there won't be much
chance of that.
In Australia you can injure yourself outside of work (ie do your back in or
break a leg) and then go to work, claim that you have had a re-occurence of
the injury and the employer is responsible for all the costs associated with
it.
Take an example where someone breaks their wrist - the employee goes onto
"suitable duties" whilst the claim is being followed up.  Just before the
end of the financial year, and estimate is made on all outstanding claims
costs - these are then taken into account when projecting next year's
premium.  Even if these costs never come to fruition, you do not get the
money back.
Unfortunately there are people who see this as an easy way to get money, and
can therefore be abused with the employer left out of pocket.
It therefore support's Rastus' complaint - why would an employer hire
someone who is known to have made a claim, regardless of what the injury is?
