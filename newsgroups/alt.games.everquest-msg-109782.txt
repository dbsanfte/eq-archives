I'd imagine that the machines that run EQ with SoL comfortably today would
have no trouble with it.
I assume that the reason SoL is so inefficient is because it is a patch on a
previously inefficient engine and not a whole new code. Either that or
Verant are not capable of writing a decent 3d engine in which case, fear ;ï¿½)

Anyone notice how much the "new" ideas sound like DAoC? And property, hmm,
been in AC for the last 3 months. I suppose these are changes they can't add
to the current game.

Will the news of EQ2 make people drift a way? Characters will not be ported
across so why bother with advancing if in a years time (ok that is VERY
optimistic) the servers will be dead. I can only guess they are doing this
because they cannot make anymore changes to EQ in it's current state (given
how well it reacts to changes/patches as it is) and rather than let the game
go stale and lose out to competition they will start from scratch. Oh and of
course, profit.

Oh well, although what I read didn't sound promising to me, judging it at
this stage would be pointless. Screen shots look nice and the idea that they
can learn from their mistakes and steal others ideas (which is only fair as
DAoC, AO and AC all had EQ to use as a test bed) should really make for a
better game...
