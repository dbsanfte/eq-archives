I'm not flaming.  I'm just amused at you, because since the dawn of
computer gaming, there have been frothers enthusing about what is "the
next big thing" - I've seen the same arguments of "Hey, you MUST try
this!!  Game XXX sucks big-time ever since I found Game YYY" for
decades. Just speaking about MMORPGs I have seen people rave about
CoH, then leave it, and I've seen them rave about EQ2 and (apparently)
abandon it. It's just funny.
