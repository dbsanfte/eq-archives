Your problem, IMO, is some of your items are real twink for your level (BP,
Waist and Back) and others aren't of the same level, it's sort of a half
completed job, like upgrading the Engine in a Car but not doing the brakes.

Sash of Dragon Born...sell it and buy SCHW for ac stats and saves (2% less
haste or something like that, this may sound poor logic but your attack
speed is dropping as soon as your stamina bar goes) then something as cheap
as a Black alloy Girdle will give you 5 Sta and 8ac. Ry'gorr collar will
give you 9 AC and 4 Sta. Spider Fur Cloak another 4 Sta.
Crystal Chitin Arms will improve AC and +5 Sta.

I wouldn't worry yourself about resists at the moment.
