But there are still lots of places that druids are almost required to get
to. Wakening Lands, Cobalt Scar, Iceclad Ocean just to name a few. Not to
mention, PoK is so laggy (even now for me, with my recently-upgraded
computer, it's still laggy enough to be a bit of a nuisance to try zoning
into it...takes 3 times as long to zone into PoK and 4 times as long to zone
into the bazaar as any other zone) that direct ports from, say, Butcherblock
Mountains to the Great Divide are preferable to running to the BBM book,
taking forever to zone into PoK, dealing with lag in PoK (especially running
past the Nexus stone) to get to the GD stone... No, I think druid ports will
always have a place in the game for many people.

But, that's just my 2 cp...inflation has probably nerfed the value of those
2 cp also. :P
