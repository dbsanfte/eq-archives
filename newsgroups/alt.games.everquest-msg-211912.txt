"around 60-80 dps"???  Jeez, I get "around" 150 to 9k dps.  :p

I have a feeling your parsing leaves much to be desired.  :)

Ok, first problem, the beastlord was doing more than the warrior.  I
*guarantee* unless that beastlord is the worst played beastlord in the
history of EQ that he was doing more than the warrior.  Again I have to
assume that your parsing is faulty.

And that you group with some stupid rangers...

> 55 monk = 34 dps

I do see one of your flaws in figuring out dps.  "with 70% on all of us"... 
It's not 70% on all of you, it's 70+x on the beastlord, 60-ish (dunno really
what their pet haste is at that level) on the beastlord pet (which I *know*
you didn't parse right), 70+x on the warrior, 70+x on the ranger, and 70+x
on you.

You don't mention atk ratings either, which can have a much more than
minimal impact on DPS (thus why primal weapons are considered so useful, and
the monk epic adds more DPS than *just* 40% haste).

I have a feeling that if you took logs properly, with *all* the relevant
info, and sent them to someone like me you might be surprised at how it
actually shakes out.

Go find another pair of monk gloves with *half* the stats of the monk epic. 
It's worth it for that alone.  Now add in the 40% haste, insta-clicky for
fighting dispel mobs if you're a raider, +atk, and any monk that doesn't get
their epic is making a huge mistake.  An *almost* acceptable substitute is
ornate gloves, with the same effect as monk epic and half the stats.
