In that case, maybe have The Faceless One appear, /bonk Soandso on the head,
and ask, "Remember me?  Muahhahahaha."  Then both mysteriously disappear
without a trace.  Several days later, Soandso reappears in the land of the
living, pale, shrivelled, and infected with every disease in the game.

Same for Mr. Bagofpeanutsattheirfeet.  Once the Faceless One wreaks his
vengance, Tunare turns all his food into peanuts for several game
months...similar to the 'Midas Touch' curse of Mr. Gimmelotsofplat.... Or,
Tunare could turn him into a bag of peanuts just outside of Crushbone, and
have GM run Orcs consume him as a snack.....

Oh, if only I were a GM.... Muahahahaha....
