I agreee completely. It is an accomplishment. And for guilds that aren't 
totally "Ubah", don't write it off. One of those two one handers is 
still used by many tanks for good aggro if you can't get better.

Yup.

> I'm trying to set up some raids with my guild...

You'll need to define a bit better what your guild is raiding now and 
how powerful you are, both in numbers, equipment, and experience.

> Anyone have any tips for a raid on the Sarnak Queen in Chardok?

If your guild just skipped Chardok because it's "beneath you", it's 
probably not an issue. Can easily be done with two groups if they are 
truly powerful. (We have a couple folks here who did it with an even 
smaller force, mostly bots, IIRC.) However, if you've not yet tried 
anything on that scale, you've got some long hard miles ahead of you and 
a lot of learning. :-)

Chardok Royals can be a disasterous wipeout raid if you're not at that 
level, and a challenge if you are. Tough pulls, difficult passages, and 
a bitch of a room. Again... depends what levels your raiders are, how 
their gear is, what their raiding experience is.

Naggy can really only be done by 52 and below. If most of your force is 
at that level, you're going to have a LOT of trouble with many of the 
other drops required. In fact, I'd say it's damned near impossible. Rage 
is probably even easier. Talendor can be a pain for any guild who find 
epic mobs challenging. (Though we had a group of bored guildies kill him 
with five people a couple weeks back.) You can forget Nortlav. He's a 
fucking raid killer and no doubt, if you are not way beyond his level. 
He's just nuts.

Stick with the first one you set your sights on and judge what you can 
do with the rest later. If you have trouble with Ragefire, Hate will be 
"challenging" for you, and the pulls near Maestro will test/make/break 
your puller for sure. :-).  Spiroc Lord? Can your guild get the people 
for a very demanding raid that will take a weekend and need to be done 
over two days in long stages? And survive multipel full wipes? Bring 
lots of necros and clerics. (hint hint). Fear is a great zone. If you 
get to where you can take the mini's there regularly, you probably will 
have a shot at the rest. You'll likely get frustrated, sadly, because 
that ball from the mini's is a damned rare drop. :-(.

> Thanks in advance!

Good luck! Hope you get your light sabers!
