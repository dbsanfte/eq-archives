I have been keeping 10% normal xp for quite some time, I am currently at 
4 blues into 65, which I would guess would be far more than required to 
keep your level after 30 rezzed deaths.  This helps make up for the 6 or 
so unrezzed deaths I took, as I was too lazy to look for a rez, and, it's 
not like I lost my level.
