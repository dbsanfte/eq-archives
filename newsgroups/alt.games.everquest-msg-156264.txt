You didn't give us a lot to go on with your original post, did you?
Of what you did give, the first thing you said was you want to finish
your epic.

Now granted, we were generalizing... but there are a LOT of people who
only want to join a guild to get THEIR epic.  Thus my response.  If it

REmember, I/we don't know you in most cases.  You don't know us.  Of
course we're going to generalize a bit 
*based on the info you provide*.

Didn't see this mentioned anywhere in the original post.  Certainly
may have affected some answers, eh?
