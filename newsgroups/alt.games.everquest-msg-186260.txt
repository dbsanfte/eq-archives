All the people I've spoken to seem happy with the new system although
some members seem to have vanished off the raid radar so I imagine
they're probably the ones not-so-happy.  Hard to say, folks vanish
all the time.

We've done 20 odd raids in a bit over a week and numbers are up on
the whole; the only downside I've seen so far is person X playing
themselves AND person Y (and vice versa of course, a cute little
rota) so they can get maximum raid points by being 'at' ever raid
which I find extremely lame but you have to take people at their word
that this isn't happening even when you know it is.  /shrug

The only other problem I can forsee would be mobs being up and us not
doing them because some key people (those that maintain the system)
weren't online.  Not because we couldn't handle the mob without these
people rather that no one would give the official word to move.

What I meant was someone could win the Arch Shielding hammer from
Dain say and someone else would get the head to make the *nice* Belt
and in the old system nowhere was it clearly seen that one was more
valuable than the other.  I don't agree that all the AL values are
perfect but if they are found to be a problem we'll change them to
suit.  For example there's been some dissent about the relative high
cost of BoCs but people were forgetting they can be traded in while
most raid loot is just a wasted bank slot once you upgrade.

Officers have already said they will stop people spite bidding
although you'd have to be a bit of a mentalist to waste your own raid
points on doing this IMO.  We also have some "common sense"
restrictions in place (no high damage piercers to non Rogues unless
no Rogue wants in on it for example)   I'm fairly sure we'll do
everything possible to avoid stuff rotting.

Ok, here's an example: one of our Monks does a TON for the guild but
hadn't had any loot for about three months for some reason until was
awarded a nice hat from Ssra.  Then Emp coughed up a Caen and he got
that as well, then we did a 10th ring for him and finally he got
Dain's head a couple of days later.  So all of a sudden from being
seriously neglected he's had a veritable shower of loot - easily two
to three months worth of upgrades under a points system.  Famine then
feast, this wouldn't have been possible had we been using points as
he'd have been points bankrupt.

We don't award for points for anything other than stuff that drops
"official" raid loot.  Killed some PoS giants for flagging through
boredom (it was a raid break day) and one of them dropped a Waning
Light Katar which was given to the only person present it was an
upgrade for.  My Beastlord twink wasn't happy I can tell you.

Not seen any sign of that yet, remains to be seen when someone who
isn't part of the "in crowd" asks for help with an 8th shawl run or
whatever, heh.
