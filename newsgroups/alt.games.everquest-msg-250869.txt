Rusty weapon + sharpening stone will produce a tarnished weapon.  No flask of 
water needed.  Oh, and you CAN sharpen rusty maces.  Don't ask me how.  :>  
Try to sharpen anything that says "rusty".

To further raise blacksmithing, you can combine the tarnished weapon with a 
flask of water to produce ore of various sizes.  Two pieces of like ore (most 
of them) plus another flask of water will make metal bits or a sheet of 
metal, both of which are useful for when you want to progress even further.

BTW, welcome back, Lance/Splendid.  :)
