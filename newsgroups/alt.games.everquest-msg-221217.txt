Nope.  The problem is that the Warrior HP advantage, which used to be
20% or so, has declined to more like 10% because items with big HP are
common to all the plate classes, and buff hp apply equally to all.
Take a Warrior with 1200 base hp and a knight with 1000 base hp, now
add items worth 200hp and buffs worth 800hp to both.  See what I mean?
Now, add to that the manaflow explosion which results in knights who
can generate tons of mob hate continuously and on demand without
sacrificing their utility, and also results in DPS casters who need
a tank with that capability to do maximum damage.  So Warriors have
little advantage in tanking, and insufficient agro-management.

As I pointed out elsewhere, the level of tanking you are proposing for
knights is already present in Rangers (who have better agro control than
knights, btw, they can add hate like a knight but they also get a spell
line to reduce hate).  Knights are tanks.  Warriors need to be clearly
superior, but what most people mean when they use a phrase like "head
and shoulders above" would marginalize knights.  Groups rarely use two
tanks, a knight in a group is almost always going to be MT for the
group.  The problem at present is that knights are much more attractive
to groups than Warriors, for good reason.  Knights are actually fairly
balanced vs. casters and other hybrids at present (IMO), but Warriors
are still living with a Kunark era class design while EQ has gone
through 5 expansions since then.

Might as well just remove knights from the game then, save a lot
of trouble all around.
