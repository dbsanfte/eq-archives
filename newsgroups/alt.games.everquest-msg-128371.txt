I've grouped with several 60th bards:  none could consistently
handle three or four mobs at once.  Obviously they can do
crowd control, but that's an enchanter's job if one's available.
And there's far more high-level enchanters than there are
high-level bards, especially since the bards I know tend to
solo for XP after the 40s and don't develop the same skills
as an enchanter would.
