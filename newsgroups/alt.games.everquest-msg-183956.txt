Hello All;

I'm trying to learn/understand the different levels of food and can't find
any info.  Does the different levels like "...this is a banquet..."  or
other similar messages mean the food will last longer than what I started my
character out with? Or that I carry less of a certain type/class of food and
not run out as fast?  I'm a level 16 Cleric and can conjure food and drink,
but they don't last long. Also, does the same thing apply to water, or milk
or some of the other non-alcoholic drinks?

Thanks all in advance for your patience and time in helping a newbie. You
all have been great with other questions I've asked, in trying to
learn/understand/appreciate this great game.

Doctorzoid.
