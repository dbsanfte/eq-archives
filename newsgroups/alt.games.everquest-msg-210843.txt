You have a number of ways to go with mage PL'ing and they all are based on
the idea that as long as the Shaman does more damage than the mage and the
mage's *current* pet the shaman gets full xps.

Method 1:
Shaman stays on sidelines while pet beats up mob until it's almost dead.
Then either reclaim the pet or click your "go away" button in the pet box.
Shaman can step in to finish off the mob for full xps.  It's basically the
same situation as a PC doing 90%+ of the damage then zoning.  While your pet
is attacking the mob, you should be sitting a medding to keep your mana up.
Downside - you'll need lots of malachite.  Malachite is cheap, but since
you're untwinked you probably don't have a lot of cash.

Method 2:
Similar to above, but Shaman lays DoT's and/or direct damage on mob while
pet beats on mob.  When mob is near death, mage reclaims/gets rid of pet,
casts another, and sicks that pet on mob.  As long as the shaman has done
more damage than the new pet, Shaman gets full xps.  This one is a little
trickier because you have to make sure that the mob has been damaged enough
that that the new pet won't "KS".  This was my favorite method of PLing
twinks.

Method 3:
As you mentioned, have mage summon up a lower level pet that acts as a
damage enhancer for the shaman.
