I, too, am still using the Intell 810.  And yes, almost everyone shows up
naked or half naked with the new Luclin models.

The only fix I can think of would to be upgrade the video card, but from
what problems I've been hearing from folk who have video cards three times
better than mine, I'm not sure whether that would fix it or not.

For those not experienceing the problem, here's what we're seeing (or not
seeing!):  99% of cloth (including newbie clothes) do not appear....just
pink skin.  95% of leather does not appear.  90% of chain/banded does not
appear.

I can't tell how much plate is not appearing, but the Sentries at the Temple
of Marr show up with breastplates, but no pants.  My paladin has bronze
greaves, and they just show up as orange tights.  The newbie clothing that
does show up?  caster robes (usually most of it, but sometimes the torso
part is invisible), and Barbarian kilts.  The bottom part of Human and Half
Elf newbie tunics (the part below the belt) show up, so at least they're
wearing loin cloths.

Judging from the stares some female characters are getting, I think more
folk are suffering from this phenomena than what people are realizing.
