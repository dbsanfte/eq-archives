I don't recall where I read this, but someone was saying that the plan
was to basically make it so you run much faster if you are on a road
and not being chased.

ps: I'm level 5 now and still haven't seen a dungeon.  I've stumbled
around outside from village to village, and once picked a direction
and went as far as I could that way (far enough to find guards that
were hostile and had a *huge* aggro range, which stopped that trip!).
Anyone want to tell me where in Albion I can find a dungeon?  I'm near
Camelot right now.
