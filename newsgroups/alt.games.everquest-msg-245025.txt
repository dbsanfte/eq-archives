Bow damage is worse than most people think,even after the recent
LoS changes,I often watch me hitting the mob with only 4 or 5 arrows
before it dies in Ldons,that nets maybe 2000 damage.
Ok,there are streaks of crits for 1000 on the next mob,but its nowhere
what one could name reliable.

Not so sure about your comment about melee damage *in the endgame*,
ever heard of Darkglint Blade? - 23 delay 29 damage!
And yes its a ONE-hand weapon,and no I dont confuse damage with 
delay.
