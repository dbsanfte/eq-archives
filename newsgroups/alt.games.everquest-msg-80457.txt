Please read the FAQ.  The FAQ ideally will keep you from introducing
yourself with an annoying question.  Questions should be posted only when
the FAQ, game manuals, or related web sites do not contain the information
you need or are unclear.

Please read the EQmanual. It isn't great but it does have 'some' basic info
there.Read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in the EverQuest program
directory/folder on your computer. Lots of good info there.

And of course Play the tutorial.

    1.1   Q:What is the FAQ for?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     A:This FAQ is designed for a newcomer to the game and/or this
newsgroup.
 It attempts to answer some basic questions about the game, but owing
 to the complexity and depth of Everquest, it is not possible to answer
 all queries.  If you have a question that requires some more specific
 detail there is a list of URL's that you might like to visit.

    1.2    Q:What is the newsgroup for?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: For the discussion of all things related the game of Everquest.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.    Questions about Everquest
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.1    Q: What is Everquest?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: EverQuest is a real 3D massively multiplayer online RPG. Another
 equally accurate way of describing EverQuest is to call it a graphical
 MUD.



    2.2    Q: What do I need to play Everquest?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


   A: System Requirements

  *Standard EverQuest
 Required:

  Windows 98/ME/2000/XP
  Pentium II 266 or greater
  64MB RAM
  Direct3D or Glide compliant video card with 8MB RAM
  500MB Hard drive space
  28.8k+ internet connection
  DirectX compatible sound card
  Mouse, Keyboard
  2X speed CD-ROM
 Recommended:

  Pentium II 350 or greater
  128MB RAM
  Direct3D or Glide compliant accelerator card with 16MB RAM
  4X speed CD-ROM

 Note: DirectX 8.1 or greater is required for Windows 98 ,XP, ME,
  and 2k.

 *Shadows of Luclin
 Required Specs:

  Windows� 98/2000/ME/XP
  Pentium� II 400Mhz or greater
  256 MB RAM
  16 MB Direct3D compliant video card
  DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card
  28.8k (or faster) Internet connection
  4X speed CD-ROM
  450 MB+ hard drive space

    You will also need a valid credit card.


    2.3    Q: What are these expansions I keep hearing about?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: There have been two expansion packs to EverQuest so far, the Ruins of
Kunark, and the Scars of Velious.


    2.4    Q: What is the Ruins of Kunark?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: The Ruins of Kunark was the first EverQuest expansion to be released.
This expansion included a new continent with many new zones to adventure in,
lots of new dungeons, items, mobs, quests and spells, and also included a
new playable race of characters, the Iksar
lizardmen.  People with this expansion also were allowed to advance beyond
level 50 (up to level 60,) which was previously impossible.  People without
Kunark could buy an expansion pack only for about $20, but it also along
with the original EverQuest game for around $40 (US). This way, new
EverQuest players could buy both the "base" EverQuest game, and the
expansion at once.



    2.5    Q: What is the Scars of Velious?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: The Scars of Velious is an expansion similar to the Ruins of Kunark,
including another new continent with new zones, dungeons, items, mobs,
quests, spells, level 60 cap, ect. but it is geared towards higher level
players (level 30+) and does not include a new playable race, and is not
available with the "base" EverQuest game.  You must own EverQuest before you
can play Scars of Velious, but you do not need the Ruins of Kunark.  The
Scars of Velious does not include the Ruins of Kunark.  This expansion also
includes some upgrades to the user interface.  It retails for about $20 (US)


    2.6    What is EQ Macros and where can I get it?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EQMacros is a program which is no longer available. The purpose of this
program was to provide a means whereby users could circumvent some of the
more tedious aspects of the game. It also dispensed with some of the
disadvantages certain characters had, such as night
blindness.

    Verant has required that the author of EQMacros cease distribution, and
has stated that anyone caught using it will have their account banned.

    This is a controversial subject in this newsgroup, and has been argued
to death. Posting questions on this subject is generally frowned upon.
Further information can be found at www.xylobot.com


    2.7    Where are the Everquest servers located?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: The entire EverQuest (EQ) universe (at present, 40 separate worlds)
is run on approximately 1,000 servers. These are located in an onsite
datacenter and at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego, less than a mile from our
offices). The mix is about 60/40 (here vs. AT&T CERFnet)

    The Antonius Bayle server is located in the UK.

    2.8    Systems Questions
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    How can I increase my frame rate?
        Add this to your EQCLIENT.INI under the default section:
        UseUmbra=True
        UseTnL=False
        VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16
    Note:This may not help all systems. Use at your own discretion.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.    Questions about gameplay
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


    3.1    Q: What is the best race/class combo to play
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: To answer this question you have to ask yourself what is important to
you. If you're familiar with other RPGs and games of this nature, you
probably know that each character will have his or her strengths and
weaknesses, and that no single class/race combo will give you all the good
with none of the bad.  The question to ask is not what is the best
race/class combo is the best, but to ask which is best for YOU.  The best
way to answer this question is to learn about all of the classes and races,
and make your decision based on that knowledge.


    3.2     Q: Is there any way for me to change the deity I worship, or to
  become Agnostic?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: No, sorry.  The only way you can "change" your deity is to delete
your character and start over.


    3.3    Q: What is this "Tome of Order and Discord" book I have in my
inventory?  What should I do with it?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: Destroy it immediately.  If you give this book to the Priest of
Discord (there is a Priest of Discord in or nearby any city that you can
start off in) then you will join the ranks of "Discord"... you become a
"player killer."


    3.4    Q: Well, what if I want to be a player killer?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: Becoming a player killer has great consequences that you may not be
completely understanding of by reading the tome.  A player killer can kill
other player killers, but cannot kill or be killed by non-player killers
(with the exception of in a duel.)  Also, and more importantly, if you are a
player killer, you will NOT be able to receive most forms of aid from other
players, nor will you be able to aid them.  This means that you cannot be
healed or "buffed" by anybody who is not a player killer.  Since more than
99% of the players on normal servers are not player killers this totally
ruins your ability to get in a group beyond level 15 or so.  If you want to
be a player killer, play on a PvP server.


    3.5    Q: Oops!  I gave the priest of discord the book, without fully
understanding the consequences.  Is there any way I can undo my decision.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: Yes, but you may be better of just starting over.  Use the /petition
command and explain that you do not want to be a playerkiller any longer.
After a wait (probably a very long wait) a GM will come to you, probably in
the form of the "Priest of Order" and assign you a quest that is
"appropriate for your level" to undo your player killer status.  By most
accounts, the quests that are assigned by the Priest of Order are obscenely
difficult and will take quite a bit of time and effort to complete.  It's
better than nothing, however, and you may luck out and get a relatively easy
quest.  I wouldn't bet on it though.


    3.6    Q: I want to transfer one character from one EverQuest account I
have to another.  Can I do this, and if so, how?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: Yes, you can, for a fee.Full details can be found at
     https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves/index.jsp

    3.7    Q: How do I alt+tab out of EverQuest and return to the game?  It
would really be helpful if I could use Notepad or the web while I'm playing.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: Unfortunately, in an effort to make it more difficult for somebody to
hack their client software, Verant has disabled effective alt+tabbing in
EverQuest.  It is possible to Alt+Tab out of EverQuest (as you may discover
if you accidentally do so), but it is impossible to get back into the game.


    3.8    Q: What is a hotkey?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: A key that is customized to perform an in-game function


    3.9    Q: How do I make a hotkey?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: Run the tutorial.exe program in your EverQuest directory.  It covers
many of the basics of the game, including the creation of hotkeys.  The user
interface of the actual game is somewhat enhanced from the interface in the
tutorial program, but is similar enough that you should be able to make the
transition easily. NOTE: It appears that some versions of the game do not
install the tutorial.

    3.10    Q: How do I make a spell a hotkey?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: Run the tutorial.exe program in your EverQuest directory.  It covers
many of the basics of the game, including the creation of spell hotkeys.
The user interface of the actual game is somewhat enhanced from the
interface in the tutorial program, but is similar enough that
you should be able to make the transition easily.


    3.11    Q: What is a social?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: Making a social allows you to execute line commands and say
 predefined phrases with a single keystroke.


    3.12    Q: How do I make a social?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: On the main screen, press the Socials button.  Several buttons will
 appear with pre-made social key commands.  You can edit a hotkey by
 right-clicking it.  To edit a line of a social, just click it and
 start typing.  You can edit the name of the social in the same manner.
 When you finish, you can make your social into a hotkey.  When you
 activate the social, it will execute whatever you typed in on the lines
 of the social key.  For example, you can make a social that looks like
 this:

        /afk
        /groupsay I'm going away from keyboard for a sec, guys.

       And if you activated this social key, it would flag you AFK, and
you'd
 tell your group "I'm going away from keyboard for a second, guys."

       Any "line command" (command that starts with a slash) can be used in
a
 social.  There are even a few commands that are specifically intended
 for use in socials.  For more information on these commands and others,
 read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory.


    3.13    Q: How do I change the colors of the text?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A: See the eqmanual_supplement.doc file in your EverQuest
directory. There are programs designed to make it easier to edit these
colors and other options.  They can be found at the following sites:

         http://trafficblast.com/eqclient/
         http://www.cws.org/~pasketti/eqini.html


    3.14    Q: Where can I get an up-to-date list of commands and/or emotes?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A: Try the eqmanual_supplement.doc file in your EverQuest
directory. Also, if you visit http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ and scroll
down for the links to "Commands..." you will find 3 selections, "Emotes...",
"Game Commands...", and "Chat Terms...".


    3.15    Q: What are all these abbreviations and acronyms?  What does it
  all mean?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A: This site has an excellent glossary
http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm


    3.16    Q:Where should I hunt at my particular level/class/race?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A:The following sites have good charts on this.
     http://www.eqatlas.com/huntguidelevel.html
     http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Level_Chart.html


    3.17    Q:Why can mobs hit through walls?
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A:I was happily trading inside a vendors shop, when suddenly I died
seeing 'A Griffon hits you for 300dmg... loading, please wait...' -
WTF?......

    Mobs and other NPCs in EQ are controlled by computer AI, which is no
substitute for a <supposedly> intelligent human being controlling an avatar.
Monsters all behave according to strict rules on pathing, aggro-range etc,
and don't really employ sophisticated tactics and strategy in the same way a
human player would. To avoid unbalancing the game, Verant have opted to give
mobs an 'unfair' advantage - they can hit through walls, they ignore the
z-axis of 3D space to hit from a long way above or below a player, and
generally have the ability to hit back from seemingly unreachable locations.
This is to avoid exploits like getting easy experience by raining down
spells or arrows on a mob from a location which that mob (because of it's
programmed pathing) cannot reach. Pet using classes may gain some
satisfaction from the knowledge that their pets have the same unfair
advantages as other mobs, and can hit back at that pesky monster whacking
you from under the ground...

5.    Netiquette
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Newsgroups are like self-governing communities; there are no "Newsgroup
Cops." Instead, posters regulate themselves. Below are some simple rules of
newsgroup etiquette to understand before you venture into a newsgroup. Think
of newsgroup etiquette as a set of guidelines that will keep you from making
mistakes and make you look and sound like a veteran newsgroup poster.

    This is a non-binary newsgroup, please do not post binaries.

    Do not post in HTML

    Lurk. Read the newsgroup without posting for a few weeks. This is known
as "lurking," and it will give you the flavor of the newsgroup.

    Read the FAQ. Find and read the newsgroup's FAQ, or list of Frequently
Asked Questions and other important and useful information. It can answer
questions you didn't even know you had, and it's the quickest way to learn a
newsgroup.

    Stay on-topic. Know what's on-topic and what's off-limits. Every
newsgroup is a little different in what it talks about, and how it does the
talking.

    DON'T SHOUT. TYPING IN ALL CAPS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING. It's easier to
read a mix of upper- and lower-case letters.

    Never, ever post "MAKE MONEY FAST." It doesn't work, it gets people
really mad, and no matter what it says, it's probably illegal.

    Everyone hates commercials. Be very hesitant about posting
advertisements or commercial messages. This also gets people really mad.

    Ignore "trolls." Some people get a thrill from posting "flames" (really
obnoxious messages) just to get a rise out of people. Sad, isn't it?

    Don't "spam." Spam is posting the same message to dozens, even hundreds
or thousands of unrelated newsgroups. No matter how important you think your
message may be, it's not worth it. Think about it - if everyone posted about
every topic, no one would be able to find anything.

    Be Original. Don't overquote: Copying a long post (more than 20 lines)
just to add "I agree" or "me too" is considered bad form. Make clear who and
what you are replying to.

    The Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Remember, every expert was a newbie once.
