Regardless of meditation skill mana regens at same rate while standing?
Also regardless of player level?  Although that makes sense I'm not sure
I believe it, seems like mana does regen visibly while standing even at
high levels and loaded with Wis/Mana gear.

The formula would be crucial to this project.

mmm, actual numbers.  I have some bard numbers to work with as well
but there are still lots of open questions

I've seen one source saying that POTG and BAOR are
both 6 mana per tic

Thats kind of sad, with all the effort it takes to get even a FT1 items... but
it would be even worse if they didn't stack.

Well any sort of buff will not stack with other casters giving you same
buff.  So you can't have two necros giving you thier mana steal group
buff at the same time any more than you can have two chanters each
give you a clarity or two bards each give you a cantana.  Similarly, I
know for a fact that you can't stack POTG with BAOR (or several
other mana regen buffs)

Actually you can only do one of the above at a time, so the
stacking issue is sort of still there.

Several necros can direct feed mana into you at the same
time and you get full effect from all of them, like a mob
getting full effect off several DD but not off several identicle
DOTs

Similarly, this line of songs pulses mana into you each tic, and any number
of bards can be hitting you at the same time for full effect.  As the songs
in question are singing based, its been reported that Amplification increases
their effect.  I imagine Voice bonus items will do so as well.  My current
DD does 19 points or 30 points amplified, this suggests that chorus of
clarity will do not 12, but 18 points per tic, or more than clarity 3.

Well I'm hoping its a group project, everyone fill in whatever blanks they know
about, that sort of thing.
