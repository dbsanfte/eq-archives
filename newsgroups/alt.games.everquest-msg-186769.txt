From the shadows, the mysterious MV <nospam@nospam.com> (if that IS
his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

alt-enter while in game to go into or out of windowed mode, but it
sounds like you're already there so you can try shift-alt-r - that
retakes control of the mouse cursor from EQ, allowing you to
reposition the window.

It occurs to me you may not be able to get into the game because of
this however?
