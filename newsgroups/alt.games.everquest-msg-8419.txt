Bullshit. There are far too many players who show absolutely no 
consideration for other players when they kite. Any one who is kiting has 
to know whether or not whatever he/she is kiting is a threat to other 
players. 

Anything that always attacks the nearest player or casts any area effect 
spells *must* be kited away from other players. I realize that accidents 
can and do happen, but in the example given by the person you replied to, 
that isn't the case. The druid(s) mentioned in the message are nothing more 
than self-centered assholes who think that the world of Norrath revolves 
around them.
