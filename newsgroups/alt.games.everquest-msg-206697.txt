Aha, that makes a lot more sense.  My cleric used stuns as a ghetto 
snare on runners from time to time, letting the melee kill them or 
reduce their running speed down to where they were easily caught.  I 
never used this as a method of fear kiting, but I can see how it would 
work perhaps, given cheap enough stuns.  Problem is that chanter stuns 
are either very short PB range, or have quirky duration problems in that 
they can be broken by melee or spell damage, so lately whirl has had a 
duration best measured in tenths of a second.  Perhaps combining this 
idea with someone else's suggestion, that mobs get Tashed before 
stunning so stun sticks longer would be in order.  If I was using this 
technique with a cleric I could just leave out the fear part, clerics 
can chain stun a mob while its being killed, no need to fear... but 
chain stunning is expensive in terms of mana.  Is that not so with 
chanter stunning?  The benefit of snare plus fear is that those spells 
are relatively long duration so you get a fair amount of damage done 
while the mob looks the other way... and that when the snared mob breaks 
fear it isn't coming back your way very fast, plenty of time to reapply 
fear.

I'll have to look into it.
