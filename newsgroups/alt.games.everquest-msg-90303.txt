Hands *above* the table at all times, Jacobson!

Yeah, that's the big one. From what little I've read, you're not the
only one who saw crashing problems with it, but it's generally
considered the Big Dog for Palm development.

Every BBS author in the world appears to have been a Pascal geek. Did
you work on anything I might have heard of? I was a Fido/Hub Telegard
operator for six years or so, and a BBS geek for probably a decade.

If I did, I wouldn't be sharing :)

The folks on the Borland groups seem to be pretty fond of it, though
they argue about their interpretations of if it's Delphi-like or not.
Bottom line, it's a Delphi-like IDE, but the language itself is not
OOP, just regular Pascal.
