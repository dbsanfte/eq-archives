 I hear people all the time in EQ talk about "this zone is a hot zone,
or I get more XP here" but never do I hear people talk about "this
zone was loads of fun even though we wiped 5 times, but damn what a
time we had when we weren't dead!".  I say XP is a byproduct of having
fun, not a goal in itself.

Any game where you're *afraid* to die is not really a game imo.  And
if all your concerned about is grinding to the level as fast as
humanly possible then I say no wonder you're bored.
People I've grouped with STILL want to single pull in the pre-60's
levels.  Jeebus, what a bunch of pansies.  Some of the most fun I've
had is when we win or die by only the slimmest of margins.  Doesn't
really matter all that much which way it goes (win or die) though I
would prefer win most of the time.

EQ has more depth of play than any game out there, at least that I'm
aware of.  It's how you play that makes the difference.
