 We don't really have a problem with him unless we're short on melee. We
don't let rogues in the back, either. That's an accident just waiting to
happen. I also think we're going to stop visiting him as a target soon.
For what he drops it's too much of a pain in the ass. Risk versus Reward
just doesn't add up.

 It's sorta fun seeing how many people drop before he's slowed. He's a
nasty mob. Once slowed though his HPs move down fairly quick. I think we
got a bp last time and the robe before that.
