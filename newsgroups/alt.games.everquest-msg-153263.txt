Yah. It's not too bad a lifestyle, but there is no future in it as you tend
to live from day to day. I definately have pathways burnt in my brain going
in very unusual directions but since I spend most of my free time under the
influence of alcohol most people don't notice or just assume I have had too
much to drink.

God forbid if I ever breed I would be reticent to let the little takka play
a team sport: "Lesson number one: you can't rely on on other people, here,
go learn something useful like kickboxing."

He may miss out on learning some social skills but at least when he get's
older and winds up in jail he won't be the bitch...
