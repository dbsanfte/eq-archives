    Here's two specific examples. Point one: Martin's guild had beat the Noq
encounter in Inktu'ta, and could beat it consistently. Part of this
encounter are adds that spawn which chase after one person until they get in
melee range, then death touch that person and despawn. (The person gets an
emote to warn them that an add is coming for them.) Martin's guild killed
these adds with caster DPS - they have relatively low HPs. I mentioned to
him how we did that initially, but then found out by accident that these
adds obey all the usual aggro rules, including root aggro. So if you put an
earth pet on them, as soon as root lands they turn to death touch the
closest thing - which is usually the earth pet. This saves a fair amount of
mana, and makes the event go faster as your real DPS (wizards) are on Noq
and not on adds.

    Point two: my guild had beaten High Priest in Txevu. In this fight,
there are five adds that charm people for three minutes each. The adds
despawn when they charm someone. At the end of three minutes, they appear
again. If the High Priest is below 50% health, one add despawns permanently
and HP is healed to full HPs. Whatever adds are left attack the players, and
proc their charm effect (at which point they despawn, etc.) We had completed
the fight the long way - kill HP to below 50%, let him get CH'ed, etc.
Martin suggested to me getting the High Priest to 52% health, holding him
there, and as soon as the charm mobs despawn at the end of a charm cycle
have everyone use offensive /discs, go full burn, etc. and kill HP before
the adds can respawn and CH him. Again, we aren't telling someone that
hasn't beaten the event how to do it. We're talking about how we made the
encounter faster and less painful to do.

    For Martin: I'm talking about HP because they gimped him, and your strat
isn't nearly as valuable. You can back out now and the event doesn't reset.

    The interesting things are what make the encounter difficult to beat.
How good a guild is at adapting or gathering information is what
distinguishes them from other guilds.

    Bah, scroll up! No need for log files! ;-)
