Reading I post I find not a person who has set their cap to hate EQ2, but
simply one who fears that they will lose something that they currently
have. YOu don't *want* EQ2 to fail, but you think it will. Am I correct?

WHy do you feel that EQ2 will have a limited community?  I have spent
countless hours on the EQ2 fan boards, and now the official boards, and
there is already a very strong community present.  For the most part it is
also a reasonably mature one (which will no doubt fluctuate).

How many quit EQ long ago and will actually be reclaimed by SOE because of
EQ2?  You might be surprised at the huge number of people in the EQ2
community who have not played EQ for a long time and would not play it for
all the modifications you suggest.  

Of course, if EQ2 were a poorly-made game it could tank.  BUt if it is
truly a good enough game that it would destroy EQ, then it is a good
enough game to build a community just as good as EQ did.
