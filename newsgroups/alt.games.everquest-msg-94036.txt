    Ortallius doesn't cast on you (he's a paladin mob IIRC), he doesn't hit
hard, he's high enough level to get you skill-ups, he's in a zone where
little else will come along and threaten you, he's close to a zone line so
you can zone out if you get low on life, he's likely not KOS to you (on
Temple of Solusek Ro faction) so you can Atone him and be safe or zone and
come immediately back.... Need any more reasons? :-)
