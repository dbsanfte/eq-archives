No, that wasn't an issue with the Gateway. Just a question of whether to
go with Crucial for 19 bucks a shot for 128 MB RAM stacks, or priceway
where I found one for eight bucks. But the Crucial one is guaranteed to
be a match, so......

I'm finding this out.

Well, cool. Glad it worked for somebody. If it wipes out on me, I guess
I'll just have to upgrade the OS (/shudder)

Depressing. Ok, you say video will *HAVE* to be upgraded. Do you mean to
run at all for Luclin, or to optimize? I mean, are we talking "not
optimal" with my current current cards, or "unplayable" in your opinion?

I found it (or a very close subspecies thereof) and it was two hundred
bucks a pop there, as well. For nine bucks more I can get it straight
from the manufacturer and be assured it's compatible. I guess I'm
fucked.
