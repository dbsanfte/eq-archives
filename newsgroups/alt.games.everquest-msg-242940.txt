   I don't agree with you.  It was an eye catching title to an innocuous
thread about a fun little quiz.  I understand that my usenet experiences
are probably much different than yours, and this could affect how I might
interpret something like this differently than you would.  I think that
people around here are capable of seeing a thread titled "You're Gay", open
it, and respond to the actual context and obvious intent without falling
into a spasm of knee jerk flaming.  I'll allow that I tend to be rather
optimistic in matters like this.  However, I also feel that the fact that
the thread has existed for a full day without devolving into flaming bears
out my assumption.

   Oh sure, pin that on me.  Ya, no one ever posts irrational flames in
this newsgroup unless I am there to inspire them.  /rolls eyes.

Cute analogy.  Over wrought, but cute.

   I know that I have little hope in changing your mind on this matter. 
And you might guess that you have little hope of changing mine.  I'm
certainly not willing to get into a flaming session about this, should you
feel like moving this in that direction.  Anybody who is familiar with my
posting history knows that I'm simply not good at that manner of exchange.
