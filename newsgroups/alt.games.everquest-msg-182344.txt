For starters, kill stealing is simply engaging a mob that is already 
actively engaged by someone else. The first person to swing on it or land 
a spell on it gets it. It's not a complicated concept at all, yet some 
have a real problem leaving a mob alone that is in persuit of, rooted or 
stunned by another player, etc. It's like a kid turned loose in a candy 
store with not a dime to spend. Their character or the risk of 
retribution is the only thing that keeps them from walking out with their 
pockets full.

Never give up on helping those in need. You will run into jerks 
regardless of your approach to the game. I try to make it a point to ask 
if they would like assistance first, if the situation permits it.
