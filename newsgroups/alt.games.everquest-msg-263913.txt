Level-grinding itself is tedious IMO, when the goal is to just grind
out the levels.  Doesn't matter if it's adventuring or crafting.  

When the system is interesting enough that you do it for it's own
sake, and the levelling part is just a bonus to the activity itself,
it stops being tedious.  ou're doing the stuff you were grinding to be
able to do.

The true nature of the beasts, though, is that it's much easier to
make adventuring interesting for most people than it is to make
crafting interesting.  And even that isn't perfect; in most RPGs, MUDs
and MMORPGs I've played, even the adventuring-path is a tedious grind
until you hit certain breakpoints.  It's even got a term coined for
it: newbie-hell - someting I've had thrown at me almost every time I
proposed perma-death systems ;)
