How can it be a "COMPLETE disappointment" if no one's played it yet?  You
are basing the "eye-candy" factor on a dozen screen shots that might only
show part of the whole picture.

The zones could be very well designed and layed out, and the level range
(35-60) is on par with Velious as far as complexity/gameplay could go.  Who
knows what quests await us, hell, "Merman-ass armor" could be the next
best-Kael armor.

There could be more to come, I just can't see how you can be that
disappointed already. Would be interesting to know what would not make you
this "disappointed".
