Maybe I am totally misreading the original post, but basically what I got 
out of it, is Bob started leading the conversation towards the incident, 
and the guy lied about having even been in beta.  Appeared obvious to me 
that he was trying to cover up any involvement in the incident.  Sorry, 
but lying, then admitting and appologizing doesn't quite cut it.  Coming 
clean up front, and appologizing might work.
