Personally... I'd stick with your friends...

WITH The knowledge of what other ppl think tucked in the back of your
mind... I would only take those 'past matters' into consideration IF they
was habitualy by your current guild. from the way you sound it isn't
happening consistently if at all anymore. only if you continue to have
problems in those area's should you leave your friends. otherwise it's
making a mountain out of a mole hill.

people make mistakes and bad judgements at times... and no matter who your
friends are there are gonna be ppl who dont' like them and if you are
friends aren't gonna like you... personally... if someone don't like me
because of a guild tag then screw them... if they are gonna be that short
sighted then they aren't worth my time imo... just like someoen who judges
you because of your skin color... no tolerance for that stupidity...

and in the end it's all about you having fun. I would have a blast if I was
somehow put into an ubar guild and got handmedowns... hell... a guild
officer in my guild gave me some of his handmedowns and I was extatic to get
rid of my cloth hat at level 49 :) if your having fun in your guild stay
there... having fun is what the game is about..

Peace and hope my 2cents wasn't worthless :)
