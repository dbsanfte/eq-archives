The point is, guards are no more than another means to get rid of mobs you
can't handle, just like zone walls, and gates.  I see nothing wrong with

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
