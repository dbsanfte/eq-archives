Yes, I think so.  There are several expansions available:

Scars of Velious
Shadows of Luclin
Planes of Power
Legacy of Ykesha
Lost Dungeons of Norrath

And there is a combo pack, Everquest Evolutions, that includes all
of the expansions except Lost Dungeons.  You should be able to get
the combo pack for about $25 or $30, which is a good deal.

If you plan to group a lot, you might also want to get Lost Dungeons
because that's where a LOT of the groups go.  You might have an
annoying time trying to find a group without LDoN.

Whichever one you enjoy the most, really.  Race makes little difference
nowadays, because most of the expansion content doesn't care about your
original faction.
