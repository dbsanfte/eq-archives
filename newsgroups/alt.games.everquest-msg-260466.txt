    Tomshardware (www.tomshardware.com) still seems to give the "best
gaming" slot to LCD's based on the BOE Hydis panel. Hydis is a subsidiary of
Hyundai.

    I managed to find a hyundai Q17 (one of the models that has this panel)
for $200 less than a competing brand with the same panel - so check your
prices. I have found it to be absolutely superb for gaming - I do notice a
little blurring, but basically it's only when im spinning 180 degrees very
quickly or something, and instead of seeing a series of jerks like on my old
CRT I see a smooth blur until I slow down again. Any time I'm trying to
target stuff or anything it's pretty much perfect. The brightness is
obscene - I ran up to the fires burning at the EC ldon camp and the bright
light hurt my eyes :). Better yet, the colour is staggering. I find myself
wandering around staring at stuff...

    I have only two issues with it - it *doesn't* do perfect black, although
I don't notice in game, and when the screen is totally blank it's a lighter
shade of dark-grey at the top and bottom than in the middle.

Cheers,
James
