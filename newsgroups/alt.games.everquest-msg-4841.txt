: So my question is..at lvl 7 is the journey relatively safe or am I likely 
: to get killed as soon as I start?

  I don't know anything about Smithing, but at level 7 you should beable
to sneak through Blackburrow to the Qeynos Hills, and from there there's
nothing in the way of importance to stop you from getting to Qeynos and
then taking the boat to Erudin.

exterior transtemporal mechanics function when you're dealing with
omni-dimensional ripple effects triggered at the end of a continuum
packet.		- Kurt Busiek
