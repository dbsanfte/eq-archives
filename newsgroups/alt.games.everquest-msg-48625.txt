Hello there... No question is stupid, lemme help ya out

AFter you die, if you want your money and items back, go to your corpse and
loot it.

What classes are you playing? do you know how to set up spells? Try the
tutorial.exe in your EverQuest directory if it is there.
Also - before you attack something, hit "c" to consider it. it will give you
an idea of how hard it is.. actually it just tells you what level it is and
how your faction with it is.
If it is black/white, its an even chance. Yellow is 1-2 levels higher, and
red is 3+ higher. Blues, until around level 12ish are 1-4 levels below and
green is 5+(blues and green range chance as your level increases. Green will
not give you experience, and low blues dont give a good amount until upper
levels). Go for the black/white or blues.
If you dont have the tutorial, when you start a casting class, there are 3
scrolls in your inventory. one is a guild note, the other 2 are spells. open
your spellbook (click on the spellbook picture or type /book), click the
scroll onto the mouse cursor, and place the scroll in an empty slot. after
it is scribed to your book, click the picture and onto one of the empty gems
(there are 8 of them, to the left of the book), pick a target, and click the
gem to cast it. To speed things up a little you can use your hotkeys (the
boxes under the spell gems). To set a hotkey, hold down the left mouse
button over a spell or button (such as a Social, or the Sit button), and
click it once in a hotkey slot. You can use keys 1-0 to use the hotkey in
that slot. The numbers goes from left to right, down a row and repeats.

Hope this helps, good hunting
