Yeah this spell is literally a lifesaver and seems well-balanced. I've 
clicked it maybe 4 or 5 times since I've had it, and actually had it go off 
only this one time. I will upgrade it to Adept III at some point.

By the way, I exited that other thread after the first responses started 
coming in from the usual gang of idiots, but I meant to answer your question 
somewhere. My /played time when I hit 50 was around 60 days (I didn't check 
till later). The /played statistic here has the same flaws that it had in 
EQ1, namely that there's a lot of time spent online not playing (e.g., 
merchant mode) that goes into the /played value. My guess would be around 
30-40 days of actual play time driving my character. A pretty regular 
weekday evening schedule and some intense weekend drives. The pace won't be 
sustainable for a long time (they never are for me, which is why I rarely 
stay for any MMO after the first few months) but that's usually my style - 
big bursts of intensity followed by a gradual decline and then I move on. 
The only MMO I've ever come back to after such a departure was the original 
EQ, although EQ2 will probably break my record for initial involvement. 
Going on six months now, with no end in sight.
