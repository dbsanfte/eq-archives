I used to listen to a lot of metal while playing games but these days I 
prefer to immerse myself in the atmosphere of the game itself. The music 
I listen to these days is mostly the more symphonic black metal as well 
as some industrial.

While I don't think the EQ music is brilliant, it definitely gives the 
game a lot more atmosphere which fits the scene than any of my music 
does. One problem I find personally when playing games and listening to 
my own music is after a while my brain associates the music with the 
game, so when I listen to the music elsewhere, I think of the game :/ I 
have ruined a few good albums this way, so I try to stay away from it now.

At the moment I am a little obsessed with Summoning. Their music is 
absolutely brilliant. Norwegian Lord of the Rings inspired atmospheric 
symphonic black metal, in my own words. If you like dark fantasy, LOTR 
in particular, give it a listen. It fits LOTR perfectly, and EQ nicely, 
but I don't want to ruin it by listening to it while playing.
