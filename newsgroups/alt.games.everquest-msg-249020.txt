What spoil?  The quest item is (generally) droppable.  Bribe a lowbie to 
farm it for you.  Alternately, TLC has no effect on raids.  Go to bazaar 
and ask one of those mules if they'd like to form a 2-man raid.  Many 
times, they're willing. Either way, you may make a friend in the process.

Aye, that is a high price.  But strangely, in combination with the 
droppable items feature, it works out rather well.  Rather than starting 
an alt to use all that class-other-than-yours gear, it sells pretty well 
in the bazaar.  If you just want to play a second class, start it up on a 
different server.

Its one real flaw is that it encourages multiboxing over alting.

There's nothing saying you -should- be able to understand everything 
that's said.  I actually had some interesting experiences that were made 
more interesting by the inability to clearly communicate.  Particularly 
with Iksars, who seem to be the race least likely to cave in and learn 
Elvish. :)
