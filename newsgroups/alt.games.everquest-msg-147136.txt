>>How do you get your xp. Root kite? (lol, u might make 60 in the next
century) <<

Well.. that and grouping. Forgive me for not feeling the need to be uber,
but to me it's all about the journey and not the destination. I *WOULD* be
60 right now, if I hadn't spent my time working on tradeskills, quests, AAs
and my other characters.

I honestly don't think quadding has been 'the rage' for the past three
years -- I'd say since after Velious came out. People mighta been doing
Spirocs before then, but I'm not sure.

Oh and about Verant not 'doing anything' about quadding...

/points to unsnareable mobs and the recent attempt at exp changes.
