Sorry, this would be treated the same as leaving a company with
company secrets. You signed a contract stating you would keep those
secrets. You agreed to the terms of a contract once. That is all that
is needed. The only time clicking decline later would free you from
any terms of the contract is if those terms changed, and then only the
terms that were changed. Popping up every time is merely to give you a
chance to review the terms so you can't use the "I didn't see any
contract" excuse.
