  Not a stupid question, but with a little research on the web you could finally
find an answer to your question. :P

  'Epics' refer to the powerful class-specific particle weapons which were
implemented a while back.  Each class has a quest which is designed to be 'epic'
in scale, which, when successfully completed, yields a powerful weapon that has
a particle effect (i.e. the flaming paladin swords, glowing leaves swirling
around the druid scimitar, red skulls emanating from the shadow knight blade,
ect.)  The epic weapons aren't usually the BEST weapons available to the
different professions, but most of them have something really nice about them (a
powerful proc or a good triggered effect, plus resists and stat boosts) and the
weapons which are better than the epics are typically rare drops off uber mobs
in uber zones.

  Technically not all of the epics are weapons... the monk epic are actually a
really nice pair of gloves, the magician epic is a spell which creates the NO
RENT epic weapon itself (which in turn has a triggered effect that creates an
awesome pet), the ranger epic is actually two weapons, and the warrior epic can
either be one twohanded sword, or split in to two onehanded swords.

  I hope that answers your question. :)
