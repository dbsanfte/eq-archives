Ok, so i'm in the Top-50 on my server. I make groups that are hardcore and
choose players based on tactics. I don't play the cleric class, although I
do know class abilities skills spells etc. In LDoN, I have yet to find a use
for a cleric!? Yes, I always prefer druids! Why you may ask?

LDoN has dungeon time constraints (90mins), so if someone dies i don't want
to have to rez someone and deal with the 0mana and rez effects downtime.
It's alot more quicker just to loot the corpse (except 1 item) and rez that
body when you have completed your primary objective or when it pops out of
the dungeon (with a pocket cleric / friend cleric that is camped outside).
Not only do druids have great heals sufficient enough to go into LDoN
dungeons (they have CH now), but they also have HP regeneration spells,
damage shields, nukes, HP buffs, resist buffs and more!
This leaves me totally baffled about what clerics do in LDoN? They have
become "Rez Whores" that are parked outside the dungeon! When i recieve
tells from clerics wanting to join my group i usually turn them down!

Rezzing in LDoN = BAD. You don't want rez in LDoN period! Do it after the
adventure! Clerics are useless in this expansion. However i feel this is
very wrong. A cleric should be kinda like the "dream healer in dungeons" not
a druid!? A druid is an outdoors class, not a dungeon dweller clad in plate
armor.

This leads me to my "rethinking" of the way ressurection works to fix this
issue.
When you get killed you respawn at your bind point with 0 mana and "death
effects" (which is the same as what is today known as "rez effects"). This
way you wont be able to save time just by running back to the dungeon and
loot and carry on as if nothing has happend. Ressurection should now work so
that when you recieve a ressurection you are restored to your corpse with
full health and full mana (or 75% of total whatever seems to balance well)
but *without* ressurection effects. The only thing you've lost is a little
XP, your buffs, and some downtime (and that should be penalty enough). Now
we suddenly have greater use for clerics in LDoN!
____________________

Another issue with LDoN is when your MT goes LD and can't log back in (or
any other member). There should be a way to "recruit" a new adventurer into
the group to take that spot. MT is a must on certain adventure types. This
also helps prevent issues like when some members saying "oh, i gotta go to a
raid now.. thank you but my priorities are on raids with my guild and not
LDoN". Some reports have also been that people just gate out if they are
dissatisfied with the group, leaving the group stranded in a hellhole with
no chance to complete. There are infact assholes in the game that love to
spoil other peoples fun sadly enough.  Some of my good friends have unstable
connections. I never group with them in LDoN because of this.
You could enable the group leader to be able to go outside the dungeon and
invite someone back in after the character who was flagged for the adventure
has been gone for over 3 minutes (this helps prevent exploiting by swapping
out tanks instead of healing them, or swapping out casters when they are out
of mana etc).

____________________

Apart from these two major concerns with LDoN i think this expansion is
awesome. No more do noobs need to be in uber guilds to get good loot. They
just need to stack up loads of points and buy it, which is good, it helps
keep lower end guilds together.
