Yah - not fear kiting, my concern is where they go once they start
deathmarching. It is what I call a <grey> area as I am aware of the pathing
and use it to advantage though. There is enough black in (my) grey to get my
ass busted if say, a pissed off  GM was gunning for me, otherwise I would
have to be pretty unlucky.

This one I consider fairly black as well with a few exceptions. I am hunting
JaggedPine lately and the pathing there in the safest spot for me (a corner)
is a bit screwy. I got my ass handed to me on a plate quite a few times
becuase of the odd wanderings the mobs choose to get to the corner I was in,
until I learned what paths they were taking. It was a fairly small step from
learning how to correctly drag them back to the corner without them marching
off to the centre of the zone (bug) and aggroing everything, to then
discover the added time it took to correctly pull them could be spent
landing a spell and not just twiddling my thumbs. I still don't think that's
white of course, so wouldn't whine if a GM kicked my hiney. I definately not
moving out of the corner as that's the only sane spot to pull to (and med
in) as there are no wanderers.

Aye, that's why I reckon you should /bug and /report the incident. I
wouldn't keep on reporting the same incident though - it's like arguing with
the umpire. They know the problems and it's their job to get it fixed, not
mine. If I was in a shop and saw someone shoplifting, yeah I would tell
whoever was at the checkout, but if they chose to do nothing I wouldn't try
forcing the issue. I don't go out of my way to find bad pathing, but I don't
feel bad if it works to my advantage on occasion. Heck - pathing has screwed
me soooo many times... At present if my pet get's stuck on landscape in many
places and I don't summon him within about 30 seconds - he just *poofs*.
Cool eh?
