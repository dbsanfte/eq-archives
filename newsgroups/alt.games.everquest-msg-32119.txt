Bearing in mind I'm not by any means an experienced player ( I've only been
around for a couple of months ) -

To be honest I don't really see a major issue here. When I've grouped so far
I've asked other members of my group to let me know when they need
rebuffing. The main reason for this is that as a low level caster I hardly
ever buff myself, saving all my mana for group members and emergency
healing.

I find that people in general so far have been more interested in getting
the next fight underway than waiting for me to med up fully so I can expend
the extra mana it would take me to effectively monitor their buff status.

In a group I figure that the best bet is to set the process with the other
players. If you want to be buffed on time when your buff runs down perhaps
tell the druids to sow themselves and then rebuff everyone when it runs
down. Maybe they don't know about this kind of method. If you're a caster
and you group maybe it's a good idea to say "hey, if you run down on any
buffs let me know". If no one can reach an agreement at that point then it's
probably best to disband - bit too serious getting worried about something
like this when I'm playing to have fun really :)

In a nutshell I don't think it's the casters responsibility. I don't think
it's the tanks responsibility either. In fact I don't even think it's
necessary that there should even be a standard "procedure" here. Just decide
on it when you group, communicate it and everyone will be happy with it

Just my ( rather longwinded as I couldn't think of a better way to phrase
it ) 2c
