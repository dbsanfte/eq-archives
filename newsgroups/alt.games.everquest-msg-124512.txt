Yes, Bards do get some Area Effect buff songs, no grouping required for
those.  Not sure what those currently do for aggro.

Battlecry of the Vah Shir - Area effect Hast Song - Level 52
Elemental Chorus - Area effect Cold, Fire, and Magic Resist - Level 54
Chorus of Replenishment - Area effect Mana, Health and Stamina regen - Level
58
Warsong of the Vah Shir - Area effect Haste Song - Level 60

Those are the ones I found at a casual glance through the list of bard
songs.
