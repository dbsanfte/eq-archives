I know how to get a screen shot, but I can't get a facial view of my
characters.  In third person, the camera view turns with them.  What trick
have I missed?

All my characters are on Protector and has anyone noticed that level 5 seems
just a bit tough for a mission to push through and open that next level of
skills?   And what is with all the team invites?  No one talks they just
slam me and I have to keep getting rid of that icon - if I'm fighting or
almost done with a mission that's the last thing I need.  And KS is kind of
bad overall, but at least you get some xp for it, and if you do half damage
you seem to be the target to get any loot.
