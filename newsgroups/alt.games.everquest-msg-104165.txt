Just to add yet another story of someones kindness to a relative new player to
EQ.  I was playing my level 11 monk and trying to get my tailoring skill up in
everfrost.  Along the way I got an HQ bear and an MQ bear.  Since I didn't have
the skill level to use either of these at the time I put the pieces up for
auction at 20pp for the HQ and 3pp for the MQ.  A higher level druid tells me
to meet them at the Halas ramp.  We meet and I put up both pelts in the trade
window and then I see she put up 40 PP.  Part of me (the devil on my shoulder)
said just hit trade but the other part of me won out.  I told her that she gave
me too much, I don't have 2 HQ bear just one and an MQ.  She said, "Don't worry
about it".  We did the trade and then she then preceded to buff me (and I
didn't even ask).  At that time I wasn't fighting for XP (I was working on an
undertrained tailoring skill) but with the buffs I went out and started hitting
up yellows and what I knew to be low level reds for XP.  Now I am a few battles
away from 12, 40 PP richer and thankful to a kind Druid.
