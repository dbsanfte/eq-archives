Gordon loved EQ when it sucked a whole lot more. He honestly thought
people should just accept that the game was incredibly hard to travel
in and get bound in. He made totally invalid comparisons between the
way EQ was in difficulty and in the fact he had to wait on a console
game he was playing until the end of the level to save. He is either
very sadistic or not very smart.

So really anything he says is too good is pretty invalid. It would be
similar to Pat Robertson saying that prohibition should have never
been repealed, its coming from someone with their own agenda.
