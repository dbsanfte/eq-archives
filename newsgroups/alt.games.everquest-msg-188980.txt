    Next time that happens, do everyone on your server a favor and do the
following.

    Scroll up in your chat window so that your "hey, I was killing that!"
and his "SO?" are together within the last TEN lines, and type /report
<dickhead kill stealing monk's name>

    Then type /petition <dickhead kill stealing monk's name> just blatantly
KSed me <where when what> I have also filed a report of him admitting it.

    I know it seems trivial but that kind of behavior can be a LOT more
infuriating than that, and needs to be stomped on whenever it crops up.
(picture people who've spent the last 8 hours camping the ancient cyclops in
south ro, root/rot it and then the monk turns up and KSes their kill.
Welcome to waiting another 8 hours while monkey magic goes and makes some
boots worth more than everything else he's wearing put together and sold off
at twice its worth three times over)

Regards,
James
