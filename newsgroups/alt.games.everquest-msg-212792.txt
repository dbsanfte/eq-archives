I've heard similar stories regarding him.  OTOH - 2 groups of NToV
clad 65's from our guild took him down the other day when they were
down there to take out Yael for some warrior shoulders quest.

On a related note - I was PL'ing my buddy's 31 (32, 33 and almost
34) monk in Echo the other day - pretty straight forward: Cast a pet,
hit the q button (target nearest NPC) cast Malaisement, pet kill,
cast BOIV - sit for about 10 seconds, stand, reclaim pet.  Rinse
repeat.  The monk then just killed the runners (had his cleric there
rooting them so the monk got defense increases).  Start in the room
next to the deep, clear it, then move to the next room closest to
that, clear it, then to Taskmaster Tokazh's room.  One time, instead
of the Taskmaster, there was this really cool mob (Xilinov?) and
I didn't make any special preparations.  Out he comes, and starts
chewing up my pet a bit. Blue at 65.  Oops, no buffs at all on pet,
and BOV has an AC component.  I barely get BOV off before I get mezzed.
My buddy throws a heal in, then it's a race to see if I can get
off black steel and interrupt his mezzes and kill him (got mezzed
one more time).  I could have done him no problem if I'd known what 
I was facing, but that first mez came as a *big* suprise.
