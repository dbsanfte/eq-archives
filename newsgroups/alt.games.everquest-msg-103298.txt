Your example would be better lumped in with the nuts (people sufferring
from mental illness) than the hypocrites (people engaging in calculated
deception).  Sounds to me like the person you speak of had a serious
problem (unable to resist the lure of gambling) that she tried to
compensate for by attempting to eradicate all gambling.  Attacking
a problem tangentially, without facing or admitting your own weaknesses
(character flaws, mentall illnesses, whatever you care to call them) is
a practice engaged in by millions of people worldwide since time
immemorial, often unconsciously.  Now if she'd been running an illicit
casino in her basement while campaigning against pull-tabs and bingo
halls...
