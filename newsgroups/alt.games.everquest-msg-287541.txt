Getting PL'ed to 80 is different from making the non-PL route a bit less of 
a chore how, exactly? You're suggestion completely supports their changes. 
The game has moved to the 60's and up demographic. Throwing a bone to 
players who lack the "luxury" of a level 80 PL team makes perfect sense. 
Funny how on one hand you endorse PL'ing someone to 80, yet on the other 
hand criticize those who would ask for it. Not exactly consistent with the 
purist view you seem to support.

More than that it lets people of appropriate level access the content they 
would otherwise not have a chance to see.

Well, I've got to hand it to them. They tried with TSS. Unfortunately their 
earlier efforts being almost exclusively directed toward the end game 
created a gap between the lower levels and the other 90% of the player base 
that sprucing up the early levels just can't do much to close.

I would tend to agree.
