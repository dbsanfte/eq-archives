Depends.
Whats your Cha now ? If it is over about 120 don't worry.
If you don't charm don't worry either just buy some steins for trading

Do you have focus Items ? If not get some.
There are some easy quests in the Pok to get some level 2 items

After those :

Do you ever run out of mana before the healer in grp situations ?
If so get more +mana

Do you ever die ?
Get HPs and AC 

Do you fight lots of casters and get hit by spells ?
Get resists up

Do you have *really* good friends ?
Get some Flowing thought items (Well at least the earring of solstice)

In general I would :

Cap Int 
Get Cha to 120
Get some focus in your life (Spell haste, Mana Pres, Extend Range, Extend 
Enchantment)
Get Mana / AC / HP (in that order)
Build a Resist kit

It sounds like you are already better off than me, but here is my magelo :

Note I have a different hat in the bag for non enchanting wear that takes 
my cha over 120 and my int to 234

HTH
