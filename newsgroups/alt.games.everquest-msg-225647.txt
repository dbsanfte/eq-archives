Has it been changed to that? I wasn't led to believe it was.
In fact, everyone I talked to about it said it wouldn't be
granted but, hey, I gave it a shot. BTW, I had a reason for
wanting it changed, I didn't just say 'Hey, can you change
it?' Consensus has been that since my reason for wanting it
changed was a roleplaying reason, whoever changed it must
have had a soft spot for roleplaying. :)
