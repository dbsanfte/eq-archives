Shouldn't be any other mobs that will be a problem if you are not KOS in
NFP.  The issue will be faction at that point.  The way the shaman epic
works is that you need progressively better faction to complete each step of
the quest.  I am not sure if Indifferant will be high enough for that step.
You get the faction by going through the individual steps of the quest.
They changed this at some point so that a shaman could no longer bypass 95%
of the quest, and just do the last two or three steps.  Pegleg is probably
the most convenient for doing the starting part, if you have a druid handy,
if not, gfay spire is not that far away.  Just repeat that part and the
Bondl part until you see you faction get to indifferent.  After that you may
be able to do the next step as well.  The step after that gets to be a pain,
but once you can do the part after Bondl, you can redo that part by just
talking to Bondl again, and he will spawn the spirit in NFP, no gem
required.  Not sure if the faction boost is the same for each of those
parts, if so, then just repeating the Pegleg/Bondl part will eventually get
your faction up high enough.  I also do not know if the spirits are undead
or not.
