Bah, I'd recommend doing that anyway!  Not *all* newbies you see are 
PLing themselves or twinked totally out the ass.  Some of us actually 
still play the game.  ;)

Me, I'm on Firiona Vie (1 character per account) and now Rallos Zek 
(PvP, ooo).  A lot less high-level camping on the former, and with 
Rallos' one-item-loot rule, well... I'm thinking you'd be a bit foolish 
to go around wearing some obviously-twink item.  Kinda like wearing an 
expensive watch in a bad part of town.  :)
