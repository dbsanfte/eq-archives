It's not painless.  You lose XP.  As soon as you die, you lose a
certain amount of XP.  If you get a res, that's all the XP you lose.
If you don't get a res, when you return to your bind point, you lose
more XP.  It is only that later XP you get back by going to your grave
and praying.  If you don't get a res, you also lose up to 3 points of
constitution, which you can buy back form an NPC healer, for an amount
of money that is trivial the first few levels, but by around level 15
starts to really hurt.

This loss of money is painful because of the way equipment works in
DAoC compared to EQ.  In DAoC, equipment wears out with use, and also
has level ranges outside of which it is not useful.  You tend to spend
much of the money you earn in DAoC on equipment upgrades as you level,
and a couple of un-resed deaths in a level can mess that up.

In terms of play time needed to make up the lost XP, DAoC at higher
levels actually has a bigger penalty than EQ.  The thing it doesn't
have is the possibility of losing all your equipment, meaning that if
you want to, you can walk away from a death.  E.g., get in over your
head and die?  Just eat the double XP loss and move on.  In EQ, you
are faced with possibly a very long corpse recovery while under
equiped (because your stuff is on the corpse) in an area that you
could not handle when you were fully equiped.

Even if a game had almost no death penalty at all, it could be
exciting.  First person shooters often have very little death penalty,
yet nothing I've seen in EQ as far as encountering monsters has come
nearly as close to inducing a heart attack as certain unexpected
encounters in Doom, except possibly the time I found the Ancient
Cyclops up in South Ro.  The AC encounter was one in which I had
virtually no risk of dying.  The only slight risk of dying was that I
opened that fight with my biggest nuke (I was a high 30's Wizard
then), rather than rooting or snaring, and then relied on channeling
root while getting pounded on.  (The idea behind this was to get a
jump on damage, in case someone tried to KS).
