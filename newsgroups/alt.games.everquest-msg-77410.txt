Best way I have found is that: Go to WC with lots of stacks of milk,
plain simple milk. Find Mojax Hikspin by the South End of the
lake, near the inn, he is sitting at the bank, fishing.
Give him milk, a stack of 4 at the time, and you will get faction with
Knights of Truth, Priests of Marr and even some Merchants/
Common Residents Faction. However you will _loose_ Militia
faction and thus become KOS in West and East Freeport.

If you have too bad faction with Mojax Hikspin to begin with,
get a druid to cast wolf form on you for a small donation
(easy enough with a druid ring in zone).

34 stacks(!) of milk cost me like one hour turning in, and got
me from dubiously to kindly considered by Knights of Truth
as well as from threateningly to indifferent to the Priests of Marr.

Make sure to keep Mojax hailed, as he will wander off as soon
as you first give him the milk, and some militia-factioned rogue
will steal a message for you from Mojax bed in the near building
and start running like hell. If you are low in level then after you
turned in enough milk to become KOS to militia, that rogue
might attack you, but nothing to worry about, just keep Mojax
hailed as long as possible (he will not always stop on his way) -
eventually he will despawn and you have to wait for him to respawn
at his fishing site (shouldnt take more than 5 or maybe 10 minutes).

Good luck...
