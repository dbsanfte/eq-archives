   I know that.  I also know him from when we both played on Drinal, and he
wasn't a griefer.  In fact, while I can't say we close friends, I definitely was
glad to see him whenever we crossed paths.  I know that he has been a troll on
these boards, and yes, that is a reputation he will have to live down, if he
cares to.  But as long as he makes posts that can be taken as being on topic and
genuine, then I will give him the benefit of a doubt.  

   And the only people I have killfiled are ETP and hard-core top-posters.
