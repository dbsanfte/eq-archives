Perhaps thats part of the issue here.   I'm playing from the perspective of
a 65, where as Rumble and a few others are playing at mid or low levels.
Its not like it is every day that I see NBG invoked, even.  Almost all
upgrades will be no drop and come from raid level mobs.    And everyone
knows it.

Perhaps not that many "bluff" because it's pretty easy to spot it and call
"bullshit."  Whereas leveling up in the 50's, I remember seeing some
"decent" LDoN drops for that level, if you were untwinked.


At this point, I'm not sure there are any droppable major upgrades for my
characters, other than Ornate armor patterns.
