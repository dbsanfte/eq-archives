I, personally, only petition names that  I find offensive.  I don't petition
a name just because it does violate the guidelines/rules/policies/whatever
you want to call them.  Upon rereading my earlier post, I can see where it
appears that I say that I would petition Chrysler, which I would not.  I do
think it would be a stupid name, but I prefer to let stupid names be, they
don't really bother me enough to matter, I just ignore the person, and
continue with my playing.  I also don't go around hunting for names to
petition, and, I am sure that I miss many names that I would petition, just
because they do not bring attention to themselves.
