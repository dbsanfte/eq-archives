  I agree, it is better to just move on.  As you note, usually if you
"call their bluff" and actually share with them for a while, they'll
get impatient and go elsewhere.  If they don't, you can say something
along the lines of, "Could you please find somewhere else to hunt?
This area really isn't good enough for two parties."  If they still
insist on staying, and there are truly plenty of wandering mobs or
other places to hunt, go ahead and find one, no big deal.  Also,
remember the jerk's name and pass it along to friends.  That's how a
person builds (or destroys) a reputation.

  It's better in my opinion, to let the assholes have their cake every
once in a while, than to become an asshole yourself (and risk getting
banned in the process.)
