Actually just having taken a Frog SHM through to 13th entirely in 
Innothule swamp, doing the newbie quests, I would tend to agree... but 
there are work arounds.


There is a Zone on EVERY side. Gukta, S.Ro, Guk, and the Feerott, so 
pulling to a zone point isn't unworkable. Plus theirs a PoK book.

I found it a snap pulling critters to Guk, where I could fight them 
safely without adds, until around 11th or 12th. And at that point I 
could start handling burly adds, at least one of them.

The only really rough part was getting gator spines, because I couldn't 
find them near a safe area, but I pulled those to the feerott. As a wiz, 
I could have coped with adds by running to zone, rooting the gator and 
zoning. And then returning for the gator.

Getting SoW at 9th helped, but you spend enough time in the water, that 
mobs still catch up and beat you down. Though I eventually recruited a 
ranger friend to come and assist with getting the last peice of newbie 
armor, mostly for track, but also for snare. (the mobs were light blue 
and bolting at 50% health... gauranteeing a long chase with many adds; I 
usually finished off the one I was fighting and then ran for the nearest 
zone, but it wasn't always successful).  With root you've actually got a 
better chance.

Its a difficult zone, but with the right tactics, its doable. And that, 
IMO makes it a great newbie zone... if you can learn to work in 
Innothule Swamp as a newbie, you are well on your way to becoming a 
great player. :) And the newbie armour isn't bad, and gives you a reason 
for being there, and even forces you to pick specfic targets, instead of 
just finding a 'good camp' on the edge somewhere.
