Hello All;

Myself and 2 other noobie friends were hunting in Everfrost.  I'm a lev 12
Barb Shamen, they are Lev 10 Barb  Warrior and lev 9 Barb Rouge.I SOW all of
us and out we go. I've used SOW on us several times before.  But this time
they were out running me constantly. Worse, when we got in trouble and ran,
the monsters constantly caught me because I was so slow, but my friends
could run like a normal SOW and never got caught.  We were just hunting
animal types. I saw no de-buffs put on me. My weight was 56/119 or less. I
re-cast SOW on myself several times during the evening, went to town and
empty everything I could.  My weight then was around 48/119. I had Strength,
Agility, Feet Like Cat on me.

My Question:  Is there some random number that would give me a slower run
speed? Or, why after playing for 3 or 4 weeks and getting or using SOW all
the time, would I run so slow all evening?

Thank you all that answer for your time and input.
