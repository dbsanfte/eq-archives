My baby gnome wizzard[1] is wearing a newbie robe, wolf-hide boots and
belt, and a rat tooth necklace, and is swinging a water crystal staff
some good man was nice enough to give him, and his int is 133.  Only
really bad stat he has, imho, is his cha, which is like 60.  Str is
like 65, but having a backpack and inventory slots full of rusty
weapons hasn't seen him overweight yet.
