Nope.  (Especially after the first few got the weapon) they knew they were
killing a Paladin to get it, or buying it from someone who killed a Paladin.
And if even holding it cancelled all their powers, they'd get the point
*real* fast that it's a no-no to have this weapon by any method other than
an honourable one.

When I started in the game (May, '99), I started a Rogue because Rogues
could Sneak, Hide, Pick Pockets, Pick Locks, Disarm Traps, Sense Traps, Make
and Use Poisons, and Backstab.  They were the sneakiest people in the game.
My intent was to make a character who was good with a bow and could poison
his arrows.  It wasn't until a while later that I found that Sneak didn't
work well, Hide didn't work well, no locks, no traps, no poisons.

That left Pick Pockets, which pulled from a separate loot table back then,
and Backstab.  I'M NOT A BLOODY ASSASSIN.  I *really* wish they'd created
two rogue-type classes; one a thief-type with vastly expanded thieving,
hiding, and sneaking skills, and one an assassin-type with the combat and
evasion skills.

Shamans are (supposed to be) tribal healers.  To me it makes sense that
they'd have to work harder (pay a mana penalty) to aid someone who's not
part of their tribe.  Properly, the same thing should apply to anyone who's
healing / buffing someone who doesn't follow their God.  If I (follower of
Brell) am buffing someone who doesn't follow Brell, then I'm not using my
power for the purpose Brell gave it to me.  Ergo, it should be harder.

Necros are generally viewed as inherently evil, and associated quite
specifically with death.  Rallos Zek is neither.  He's properly a neutral
God focussing on war.  Special note:  Necros should be a priest class,
devotees of gods of death and disease.
