Well, that's a lot of crashing for a production server, and you've every
right to be ticked off. I've seen Xev definitely stay up for a week
straight when no patches were scheduled, and often have had a bazaar
mule on for over 36 hours.

Test, OTOH, is brought down intentionally for patching multiple times
per day. Other times, it will just be "some zones" (which may or may not
be half the zones in the game.) This is mostly Monday through Friday, so
you can get some good stretches on weekends. Then again, this weekend
they were working on Saturday and crashed it at least twice that we were
on for.

If you're lucky, and they have time, you'll get notified a bit in
advance so you can force a save and camp. :-)
