Doesn't sound like a bad idea really. I've never asked for a SoW but I don't
really see a problem with asking for one politely as long as I offer the
caster a donation for their time and mana. For example my lowish level party
might want to get to Freeport. We'd probably save up a few platinum first
and then ask a caster whether they would mind SoWing and teleporting us in
return for a reasonably sized platinum donation. This way we could make the
panicked run across the commons to Freeport without dying after the teleport
( I hope! :) ) and hopefully the caster would be suitably reimbursed for
their time.

Just my thoughts on this one.
