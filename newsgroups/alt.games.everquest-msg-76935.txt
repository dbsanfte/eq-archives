After not being able to play EQ for several months due to not being able to
connect to the patch server AT ALL and not willing to go through the crap
tech support would have me do, I decided to give up. After several months of
being fine, I find myself longing to play EQ again. I stupidly haven't
canceled my account yet (good thing my folks have been paying for it
recently, heh heh) and Verant probably won't let me because I lost my CD
Key, so I'm considering trying to get Tech Support to help me. Problem it,
my parents would probably go ballistic on me. Or maybe I'll just wait for
World of Warcraft, which looks better, so long as I can be a Night Elf
Priestess of the Moon. Advice, anyone?
