My pc has dual monitor capabilities and enough hardware onboard to deliver. With this it is
possible to have a socalled extended desktop, where applications can be run on different monitors.
Before I buy a second monitor I would like to know whether any of you has a similar setup with
EverQuest.

thanks,
Martin
