Smithing is an excellent option; just make sure you have a good set of strength
items (strength is a corequesit in smithing, especially in higher end stuff.) I
have a halfling druid who intends to specialize in tailoring, because she has
some pretty nice cultural stuff to help fill in existing gaps (and Karana
imbued Vale is pretty nice for a druid; + WIS and + STA)
