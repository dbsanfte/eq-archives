Well, no joy! That registry entry only appears in the latest versions of
Mouseware. I have no scrolling problems with them within EQ, but they
don't have the auto scroll feature of the earlier versions. That feature
seems to have been removed after version 9.71 or thereabouts. Version
9.73 certainly doesn't have it. It looks as though I can have one
feature or the other, but not both that I enjoyed with 9.41 under
Windows98SE. For me, in the mouse area, XP is a downgrade.... I wonder
if I could get both features with an MS Mouse. Anyone know?
