ugh... sounds like DAoC train mechanics.. no agro unless you bug it or it
goes home first.

While I do like the idea of some leet dork not being able to 'peel off'
trains on me easily, it feels wrong to watch 15 things wander past you on
the way home.

I hope they are not planning to implement 'BAF' ( hmmm 35 gnolls standing
close to each other. I plonk one with an arrow. only 3 come because that's a
'good match' for my group.)

What am I saying? I'm not planning to play EQ2 anyway. Or WoW. They can
implement Barney mob AI's all they want.
