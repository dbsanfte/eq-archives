I was thinking along the same lines, but I couldn't figure any pattern out,
but it did seem that the last thing I cast was never the first thing
dispelled, as if it were keeping the buffs in a different order internally,
by how long ago it was cast, so when you refresh the spell, it moves up to
the top of the list, making it the last one to be refreshed.

I don't think this is right, but it seemed to follow through initially, or
else was just coincidence.
