Ack - most times nobody answers those requests in ooc...

I don't usually even bother to ask for a port paying
anything less than 50pp, myself being level 45.
Add one more person to that who wants a port to the same
place, and a druid gets 100pp for a port - needless to say
that I usually ask for a port in a city zone, or any other
place where druid is most times not busy fighting.

Best Regards,

PS: I get the feeling that this game actually taught me
   some advanced social behaviour things :)
   Plus it definitely is teaching me things about myself
