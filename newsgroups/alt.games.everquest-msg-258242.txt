I was just being silly. ^_^  I don't really blame Arnold, but I *do* still
get weirded out seeing him in the front of the book.  My brain can't let
go of his movie persona.

As a side note, it has been rewritten since my husband took the driver's
test when he came over from Finland 3-4 years ago.  Or else the paper is
thinner....it was a much thicker manual back then.

And I thought that if you were still in an intersection when the light
turns red you HAVE to keep going so you don't obstruct traffic.  Which
would mean you weren't running a red light in that scenario. *eyes cross*
