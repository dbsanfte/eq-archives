You can trade with a number of merchants by sneaking up behind them, just make
sure there are no guards near by. I'd advise against travelling until you get
Feign Death. Instead do your shackle quests and build up your exp. and money in
Field of Bone. You could always take up tailoring as it gives you a reason to
hunt bonecrawlers, etc. and it's a consistent way to upgrade your armour, at
least until you want Wu's that is.
