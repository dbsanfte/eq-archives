This is where I used to fight.
Note that there is one wolf trap here on the path (Indiffernet to my druid)

By moving up the North side of the path through the wood you can get to 
the Zels on the hill avoiding most of the Light crawlers. Also remember 
the mushrooms in the north west corner. (3 static spawns)

This is odd as far as I can tell they are all on the same factions.
Do you have the factions hit messages that you got when you killed the 
indoor ones ?

Are they : Hand Legionnaries, Hand of Seru, Seru or something else ?

Glad you got your self sorted, sorry that it was a mess in the first place.
