Right. Like it or not, you agree to the terms every time you play. If
you then turn around and break that agreement, you have just broken
your word. I'm not saying I've never broken my word, but I don't
expect sympathy when things go wrong because of it, I don't expect
people to back me up when I do it, and I accept the consequences. It's
called "accountability". Look it up, genius.

Oh, please. Maybe it's you who take me too seriously. Especially if
you think I would SERIOUSLY urge someone to go kill themselves. You've
been around Usenet long enough you should understand the concept of
"flaming"...unless you are somehow seriously impared.
