There have *always* been guides who are either dunderheads or don't
agree with the naming policy and abuse their position. I had one once
try to *argue* with me over whether or not "Reistlinn" was a bad name,
using the argument "Well, if we ban every name out of fantasy books,
soon there will only be names like xxhsoihhg allowed". Nice email to
the server gm (back when there were still server GMs) later, and I
never saw the guide again on /who all GM lists...

My suggestion? Go the email a GM route if the guide is being
difficult. There isn't nearly enough screening before allowing someone
to become a guide. And, really, there's no way of knowing that a guide
just said "I'll pass it on to a GM" then disregarded a name report
rather than putting it in his report as he's supposed to. In a case
like yours, the GMs can't know unless someone tells them...
