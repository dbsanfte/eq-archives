Exactly my point!

The true newbie of course won't know about the wisp quest, nor the value 
of quality skins (nor where to sell them or how), etc and that is why i 
argue the true noob might find the going a little rough. 

But as you described, even a modestly experienced lowbie will have 
little trouble earning significant cash if that's his objective... -if- 
he can manage to keep his ass out of PC, that is. =)
