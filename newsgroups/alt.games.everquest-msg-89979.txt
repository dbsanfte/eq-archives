    Sound advice. I remember back in the day before I
got out of the restaurant business.  I was the general
manager and partial owner of pizza place, a little
small joint.  You could see the whole restaurant,
(except for the walk-in and bathroom), from the 
lobby.  One day a guy, obviously a food industry
salesman of some sort, walked in.  At the time, I was
the only one there.  He stops short, and looks 
confused.  After a moment he asks "Pardon me,
is your husband here?"
   Ok, so he didn't call me sweetie.  But I
still wasn't real polite to him, I'm afraid.
