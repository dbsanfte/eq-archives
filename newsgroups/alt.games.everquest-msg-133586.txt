}Thanks a million for the formulas.

Heh, I just went back to EQtraders forums for the first time in about a 
month...and they've come up with a new formula that looks like it may be 
slightly more accurate, especially at low trivials and skills:

% Chance = Skill-0.8*(Trivial-75)

Bother.  Now I have to re-think all that stuff...
