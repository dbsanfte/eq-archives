WHAT?!?! WoW has tradeskilling. Lots of it. Learn what the fuck you're
talking about before compiling lists of minuses.

I agree here. While WoW's graphics may be inferior by technical
standards, they, IMO, are much more visually pleasing overall than
EQ2's. Blizzard does a great job of pushing the limits of slightly
older technology rather than trying to push the newest tech. This is a
huge boon to those (who I feel are in the majority) who can't afford
to upgrade systems every couple years.
