I accidentally bought a type 3 aug only to realize it will only work with LDON
merchant gear.  I got my points back by giving it to Dible Hedledrap in South
Ro.  Does that work with the actual *gear* you buy from LDON merchants?  
Any clerics find anything really *great* at any of these merchants?  I have
over 1000 points to use and am not impressed with anything I've seen.  I did
buy the *group temperance* spell but so far haven't needed it.  
It would be really nice if they would make the solvent return the augment too
when taking an aug off an item.  
And last but not least:  LDON gear shouldn't be level restricted in my opinion.
 If I've earned enough points to buy something I should be able to use it...
