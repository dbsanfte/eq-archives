Need a help on this please:

On my third soundcard now trying to make sounds in EverQuest work properly.
Problems:

"Clip Plane" of sound from distant sources is reduced and that is a major pain.
Sounds cut off in a short range from player - about 20 ft.
I dont notice mobs until they are on top of me banging.

Casting a spell, sounds metallic and very loud compared to other sounds.

I have done everything i can, including upgrading my videodrivers,
Tryed 3 different drivers for soundcard - (windowsdrivers -the one you get
when Win XP install the card, drivers from CD and drivers from
Creative - latest ones for Win XP)

Onboard sound is disabled in BIOS and the program related to it deleted.

Tryed lower hardwareacceleration for sound - makes no different.
I have no option for cancell full duplex (anyone know where to find
that in XP with a 5.1 Live ? )

Tryed move the soundcard to a different PCI slot.

Friend of mine have same problem, no sound from anything more far
away than about 20 ft. and he has a totally different computer.
He's on Win 98 SE with a SB PCI 128 (tested -should work)
and dont have PoP.
Im on Win XP with a SB Live 5.1 (tested - should work)
and do have PoP

Sounds were ok before PoP - so im begining to think that the problem
is the new sound engine which came with PoP. Many ppl seems to have
gotten better sound after PoP - on the other hand others are crashing to
desktop a lot because of problems whit PoP.

What to do next? Someone told me to /format, but why ? I'm having
a only half year old computer, havent installed anything for month, sounds
working great ( but not in eq).
Do i really have to spend days to reinstall to make audio works in eq?
Can I be sure Audio will work in eq if i reinstall ?

Yes, i have e-mailed eq tech and posted on eq tech board, but still no
solution.

Anyone that can help on this please ?
