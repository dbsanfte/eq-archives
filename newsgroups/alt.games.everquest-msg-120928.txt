Was that a bug, or working as intended? (Serious question, not busting
on you.) Last time I saw it in action was when Tiru and I were camping
the AC in OOT for j-boots for our twinks. She was using the HoUS to kill
a lot of the smaller placeholders (pirate, aquagobbie, ogre) out of
sheer boredom. Worked great, but a few seconds after each fight
concluded the thing would despawn. But I seem to recall that was right
in the spell description... something to the effect of "for the duration
of combat" or somesuch. Never saw it last more than a minute without
having something to fight.

But even if so... come on, Lance! You didn't really think you were a pet
class, didja?
