You gave the impression in your second sentence
that you had read the reply. The third soon put me
right.

I didn't say that it was "all things", I merely
suggested that perhaps a company like SOE, might
hope to become "all things", or at least, 'more
things' than what they are now.

The reasoning is simple enough; why should they
lose out on dollars from people who want an easier
way to the top, if they can manage it in such a
way that they don't lose too many of their current
accounts.

If you are in the minority, what would they care?
