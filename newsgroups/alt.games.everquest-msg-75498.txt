I couldn't resist the urge to attack the guy with me ( at the time ) level 
2 Rogue.  I had just bound, and was low on food, so it was a good option 
for me =)

I attacked him, and was amazed that he didn't fight back... at first.  
After about 30sec - 1 minute of piercing him ( did 3 points total, I think 
), he attacked back and smeared me.

I did the same trick at level 4 for about a minute and he didn't attack 
back, so I shot an arrow at a nearby guard.  That did the trick.
