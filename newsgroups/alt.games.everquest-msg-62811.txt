I had trouble running Geforce 2 Mx400 chipset cards (I tried a PNP and a
VisionTech and they both failed) on my motherboard.  It just locked up when
the resolution was higher than 640x480x16 colors.  I think my AGP port (an
intel az440 i believe) isn't AGP 2.0 compliant.  I even got a bios upgrade
and new AGP drivers and the problem still existed.  Today I got an ATI
Radeon 7200 (which works with AGP 1.0 or 2.0) and it worked fine.
