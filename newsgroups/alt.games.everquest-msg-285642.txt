This is very old info (like 3 years ago), but long ago, I tried PL'ing
my friend with my monk.  I'd get the mob low on health, then FD while
he finished it off.  This worked fine, *except* if the mob fled.  If it
was fleeing, then I got credit for the kill.  Perhaps this is what was
happening to you in Chardok?
