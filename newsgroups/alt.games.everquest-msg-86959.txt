I actually meant to come back and clarify my statement.  I meant to say 
that Kedge was released pre-Kunark.  I was not stating that you were 
incorrect that Kedge was an additional zone.  Of course you more than 
corrected your error, and provided a LOT of new info about the origins of 
Kedge.

I started playing in August of 99, and I don't remember any announcements 
about it being added, which jibes with your next statement.  I do remember 
the planes being added, though it may be just Sky that I remember.  I'm 
pretty sure it was Hate and Fear also though.

I think I remember this message.  It seems to be around the time I was 
fighing in Unrest, and I wondered what those insanely powerful level 
40somethings were doing in Dagnor's Cauldron.  I remember getting buffed 
by a cleric sitting there and thinking I was invincible.  I'm sure I zoned 
into an Unrest train and lost the buffs immediately though.  :)

Wow, this is one that should have been brought up on my server forum's 
'Remember When' thread this week.  I'll ask some of the real old-timers in 
my guild what they remember of Kedge.  I still love the look of Kedge, 
though it's become a pain because of one person who camps Phinny 
constantly with 4 characters.  He is under a lot of GM scrutiny now, so at 
least he doesn't train anyone else who attempts to camp Phinny.
