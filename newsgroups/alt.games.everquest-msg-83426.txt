I just can't comprehend why this particular rule makes some people so
crazy. The whole game is all about suspension of belief, like all
fiction, and if I run into a character called Stinkyfinger I don't have
a problem imagining that character as something out of a fantasy novel,
though it would probably be a Piers Anthony novel. I always have the
option to not deal with anyone in the game. I don't see why actually
seeing a particular name above someone else's head turns people into
Hall Monitors. Yes, it's breaking *A* rule of the game, but it doesn't
detract from my enjoyment of the role-playing. I'm more disturbed and
bothered by idiot behavior by people that aren't role-playing the parts
of idiots.
