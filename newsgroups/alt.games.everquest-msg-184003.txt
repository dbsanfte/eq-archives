What adam said is the basic strategy, you send in your sacfrafice ( in our
guild it was the Lowest lvl person on the raid ;). then have your pullers
bring it in then  let mt gain aggro every other melee run in then at  85%
everyone nuke him to hell and back and hopefully he drops before  the next
death touch,  if not your Secondary tank is now your main tank, and so on
