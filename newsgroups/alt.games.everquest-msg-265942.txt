What system specs are recommended for EQ2? My box is a bit faster than
yours, but it's no longer a high-end system (2.5 Ghz P4, 1 GB,
GF4-Ti4400/128). Reading that Bob had some performance issue on a
6800GT wasn't encouraging. (I probably won't buy the game, but I've not
completely ruled it out yet.)
