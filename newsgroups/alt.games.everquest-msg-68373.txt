Sorry I guess it can't.  I have a voodoo2 as well and I keep getting "No 3d
card" errors ro whatever it is.  so I downloaded dx8.1 and it won't pick up
DirectX 8 3d.  It's pretty lame, the game hasn't changed at all just the
specs.  So I sent Verant Tech Support an email and they responded with a
letter they've sent everyone with 3d card problems (a lot of people).  This
is starting to make me think that I'm not going to be playing EQ even if I
do get an upgrade.
