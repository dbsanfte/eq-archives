This isn't about making mobs smarter really.  Tanks were never really used
to kill that particular mob in any case.  Pookas are.  Tank was just used
as a speedbump while the charmed, hasted pookah obliterated it.  If you are
going to try to do that without a pookah bring 2 clerics and sacrifice many
first born to the dark gods for luck.  Unless you are Meemers of course :)

GoD was just a FUBAR expansion for the masses and this little tweak made in
much much worse.  

I sat through much of PoP being tank of last choice.  I really have 0
desire to go back to that stage.
