A bit late to say but most Claws are primary only, only ones I can think
that are not are JoJo's (?) claws, Stormfeather Talons and Sarnak Eitchatka
and out of those only Stormfeathers are worth having (believe all of these
are Secondary only)
As for the better, at your level it's ratio that wins it but there is very
little in it, working on dam/sec (dam*2+1)/delay in seconds it's 7.93 for
Icetooth's and 7.92 for Icepaws I'd actually go with Icepaws for the stat
(3agil isn't really worth that much tbh) and the faster speed. Later on,
where you damage bonus is higher this will be the better choice.
