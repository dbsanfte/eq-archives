An obvious troll pops in the newsgroup and spouts some offensive BS. What do
you do?

a) Ignore troll. If he get's no attention he will leave.
b) Block Sender the troll's email address in case he/she is just winding up.
c) Attempt to flame the troll ignoring the fact they will be jerking off to
all responses.
d) Check the headers and forward post including headers to
abuse@trolls.isp.com. Then ignore.

Now the scoring of this test is rather easy - 3 of them are right and one is
outright stupid....  How did you score?
