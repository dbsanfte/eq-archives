I roleplay my half-elven thief as a half-DE, so I use my Mask of Deception
almost everywhere.  She isn't the same kind of evil as most stereotypical
Teir'Dal, because she wasn't raised among them.  She does, however, have a
sincere hatred for bards.  While some in-guild bards have been advised to
stay on her good side (if they can find it), there are none that she *likes*
just a few that she tolerates.

She doesn't give a hoot about your race, since she (as a halfbreed) was the
victim of racism herself in Qeynos.
