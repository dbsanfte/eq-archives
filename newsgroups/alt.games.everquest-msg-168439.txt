Your system seems very robust, I don't think you lack the resouces to play.

Since you have no "real" control over your ISP, I would look more closely
that than EQ itself.


Here is my lag issue, and how it is more than likely realted to my setup:

Very smooth play in all zones (some outdoors are a just a tad choppy) until
I am online over 30mins AND I zone in and out of a few places.  Once I do
that I can barely move, or i have to stare at the ground just to get to a
safe plac to camp to server. Once I camp to server and come back the same
choppy zone is now playable without looking at my shoes the whole time (most
Luclin and Kunark outdoors  zones seem to hit me the hardest).

My system: P3-866 w/384Mb RAM, 40Gb HD, GeForce MX 400 w/64Mb RAM (PCI) on
Windows 2000 Pro.
