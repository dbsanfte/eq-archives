Cost me nothing- got it for Christmas.  Also my computer (XP 1700+, 512
PC2100 DDR, (2) 40 GB 7200 rpm in RAID 0, Geforce3 Ti500) obviously has some
horsepower, so I just installed it and let er rip.  Max clipping, all
textures, high detail, 1024 x 768.  Now when I was at my parents house for
Christmas I was playing EQ on my *old* computer- Celeron 466, 384 MB PC133,
TNT2 Ultra.  With everything cranked down for the original EQ itself to be
playable, the SoL box was laughing at that machine- I did not even attempt
it.  If I still had that, it would have been some serious upgrading $$.
