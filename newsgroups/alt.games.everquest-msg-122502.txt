Technically, this is a newsgroup, not a discussion board. And it's not
an official Verant device - we can say any bloody thing we want about
them here, and they can't do squat about it. This also means that they
rarely, if ever, monitor this group to see what we're saying (as far
as we know).

As for the rules being outdated or unfair, it must be noted that
that's entirely a matter of opinion.

idea.
