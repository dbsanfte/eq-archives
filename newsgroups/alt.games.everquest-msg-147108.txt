I have the same problem with my current mouse to: insensitivity.

For the last 10 minutes it has been asking "Why did the New Yorker cross the
street?" despite me steadfastly refusing to pay any attention to it.

Still, it's better than my last mouse, it stopped working after 3 days
claiming that if I really cared for it I wouldn't press it's buttons so
hard....

*hears collective groan*

In my defence it's early over here and I've only had one coffee so far...
