On eq.crgaming.com there is (was?) an interview with some at SOE who said
bluntly that PoP is focused towards higher end characters.  If you already
have the ability to port at ease then run at SoW speeds at any time, I guess
PoP doesn't really offer much.  As a mage who isn't going adventuring on the
various planes, it offers ports (great!) and a lvl 44 pet heal (that turned
out to be a so mana inefficient that I went back to the lvl 20 heal).
