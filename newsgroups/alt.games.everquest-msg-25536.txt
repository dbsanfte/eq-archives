}GMs don't do squat for corpse recovery, short of someone being in

No it won't.  'I cannot summon your corpse from here.'  Luckily, the guide 
was very helpful.  If you were able to summon your corpse out of the wall, 
it must not have been fully in the wall...  Even a toe sticking out will 
be enough.

I've also experienced the 'invisible corpse' phenomenon.  GM shows up and 
says, 'It's right here, what're you blithering about?'  I say 'right 
where?'  'You can't see it? I'm standing on it.'  'nope, can't see it.'  
'Hmm... log and come back' <I do so> 'Oh, there it is. :)'

}doesn't require a GM, and that's what a GM will tell you. If your

Yes, but they will help if it's something obviously wrong with the game 
mechanics.  Like the original poster said.
