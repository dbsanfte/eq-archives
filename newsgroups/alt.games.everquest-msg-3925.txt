I think that quad kiting is a serious issue the tends to undermine the
games credibility. One shouldn't be able to beat a yellow in the first
place much less four of them. If it cons as a match you should lose then
you should lose. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they nerfed the druids
someday. So far I've fought of all temptation to just pitch it in and
join the crowd.
