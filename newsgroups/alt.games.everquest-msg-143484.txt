I understand the above, but how does it hurt the game?

Everything in EQ respawns (with the exception of the Sleeper encounter
once triggered). Reducing downtime simply means that players will
spend more time playing.

Why should your guild (or any other) be prevented from enjoying raid
content or suffer excessive downtime, because VI arbitrarily decides
that a limit should be placed on the total number of Click-Sticks? 

Having waiting lists that span months is wrong on so many levels. It
shows that there are far too many Epic capable clerics running around
that are being held back by nothing more than an arbitrary decision.
Epic quests should be "epic" for the character. Not an "epic" pain in
the ass for the player.

The RF encounter itself is not a cakewalk for most guilds. The steps
leading up the encouter are not a cake walk either. Making the spawn a
triggered event would still require planning and coordination. 

I realize that the Cleric Epic changes the dynamic of the game
(reducing downtime), but I don't see how it hurts it. It encourages
guilds to raid more often and try more encounters. This in turn
encourages players to play more.
