Getting a rez is a pain in the HINEY in HHK.  It's the one place my cleric
DOESN'T want to go to rez people.  There is NO easy way to get there.
IMHO, a cleric who shows up for a battle without his rez spells is like a
warrior who forgets his weapons.   And as far as *I'm* concerned, high level
clerics should always have dots too.  Your JOB is buffing, healing, and
rezzing.  I'm not saying you should use dots and not be re-imbursed, but to
join a group and then say you didn't bring reagents is unforgivable IMO.
And while we are on the subject, before you head off for your group, check your
damn supplies!  We had a caster once who couldn't get his pet because he
*forgot* malachite.  Same group, his buddy didn't have any water!  What's with
that???
