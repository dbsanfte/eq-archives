I can confirm that she still spawns since OOW.  I have found here twice
since it went live.  The first time I popped into GFay she was already up  I
stupidly deleted the amulet Athele gives by mistake and had to do that part
again.  Went looking for her and she was no where to be found.  I logged and
came back the next day and she was up.
