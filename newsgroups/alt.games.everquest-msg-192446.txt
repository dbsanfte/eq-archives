Alright I have a Pentium 4 computer Running at 1.6ghrz I had 256mb of
Ram I just bought more today for a grand Total of 512mbs of Ram
Not a bad system here come's the kicker. I have an Ati Rage 128 ultra
16mb video card. No so good but not to worry I am upgrading that card
at the end of the month to a respectable 64mb card or dare I say it a
128 card.  Anyway in the meantime in the Option's in everquest what
should I turn off and leave on Resolution and Chracter wise.
