Are they the ranger only legs with real high AC?  If so, they were
added to the drop table of Dervs in WC by mistake for about a day.
Many people got while the getting was good.  On some servers the GMs
were perma-killing the dervs.  They were removed hastily from the drop
table and haven't been dropping anywhere since.

So yeah, uber rare, with no place to get new ones.
