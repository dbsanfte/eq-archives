In Starcraft, Warcraft, TFC, Tribes, Subspace, etc,etc,etc...THE GAME IS
BALANCED AND FAIR. Player skill (and internet connection, to some extent)
are the things that decide who wins.

That is NOT the case in this kind of game. It is trivial to have
overwhelming numbers, or individual power, or both, and what can the other
side do? Run or Die. Fun for neither side.

Stop trying to compare games that aren't the same.
