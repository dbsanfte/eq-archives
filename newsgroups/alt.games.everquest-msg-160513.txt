Although you got hit with a big stick for doing this, I think a lot of it was in
what you said.

If you'd just posted "hey, here are some drops, looking for information on them"
you'd probably have been ignored by the flame patrol, and might have recieved a
little more support.

But throwing down the towel of "Yes I am too lazy to look it all up on the web
LOL. " seemed to be a little too much, perhaps they all saw "LOL" as "Lying
around Laughing at you more dillegent EQers"

You did get one decent response, for what its worth, heck, I printed it out for
my own use!

Don't take the flamers here too seriously, most of them mean well and the few
that are just out and out nasty are easily put into your kill file, or you could
just laugh off whatever they heap on your head as another misguided attempt at
humor.
