Yes I just recently found out how to get there.  Directions from PoK:

Book into Toxxulia Forest (Erudin stone).  Head straight south until you hit
the edge of the zone, then turn right and a little ways down will be the
entrance to Paineel.  After zoning in you'll come to a ledge, turn right
into the tunnel, you'll come out in the newbie area, turn right along wall
and go into the first tunnel you come to, which takes you into the Warrens.
Go through Warrens (use an EQAtlas map) into Stonebrunt Mountains (probably
directions to Stonebrunt are unnecessary but a surprising number of people
don't know where it is).  Go east until you hit the lake, then follow the
lake around to the dock.  Go to the boat at the end of the pier and click on
the door, which will port you directly to the lighthouse island.  From the
island, swim south to a beach on which you'll see some shipwrecked sailors
and other stuff, and you're on Broken Skull rock, from which you can get to
all the other new zones as well.

By the way... does anyone have maps (for the EQ Cartography window) for the
new zones?  If so can you post them here?
