I did this just today, we were in a five man group with no CC and no 
healer save for paladin and ranger, so we had several downtime moments; 
our DPS was very high but eventually the damage would add up to the 
point where we'd have to rest.

At any rate, we got down to 18 minutes to go when we finally popped the 
boss, and then our second mage went LD.  We managed to pinpoint the 
location of the boss via track and rogue scouting, then used an adroit 
combination of ITU and pacification to move past over 20 mobs in our 
way, decloak next to one of the boss's assistants and engage while I 
called up pet, then pulled the boss and took him out with 4 minutes left 
to go... my pet offtanking the assistant while we blew the boss apart.

One of the high points of my career as a mage, honestly, down to the 
wire and using every trick we could think of to barely pull off the 
mission; this is what EQ should always be like!
