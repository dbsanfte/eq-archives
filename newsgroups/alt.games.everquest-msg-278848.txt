EQ is and always has been an online only game.  There is a fee to play, if 
you don't have a credit card to start your account you'll need a game card.  
If you use the game card, you'll have 60 days of play that you are locked 
into at the beginning instead of just the 30 free days.  I believe the fee 
for EQ1 is going up to $14 soon.

If you are interested in soloing alot, you might want to look at EQ2 
instead.  That game is a bit more "newbie-friendly" and might be easier to 
learn how to play.

One issue you have to look into is the minimum specs.  At minimum, your EQ 
experience will be very disappointing.  Make sure your computer exceeds the 
minimum as much as you can afford.  Get a decent graphics accelerator card, 
you'll need one, just make sure your system can take the power draw, last 
time I upgraded my card, I ended up overclocking something and the 
motherboard couldn't take it, had to go a month without my computer because 
of it.

Have fun and welcome to the obsession
