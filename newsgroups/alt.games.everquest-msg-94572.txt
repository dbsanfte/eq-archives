I was in CoM last night, got the 3 books off of Ghiosk for the next step in
my epic.  We dropped all the Reavers, nothing for the Druids/Rangers.  I am
actually beginning to think I will be seeing my epic in the not too distant
future.  While we were there, someone made the mistake of aggroing Lord Rak,
I happened to be nearby at the time, didn't even really know what happened
at first it was so fast.
