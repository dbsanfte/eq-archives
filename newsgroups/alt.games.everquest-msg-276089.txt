On a loosely connected topic - does anyone know the rules about what
characters are allowed in last names.  I ask because I'm a half elf and
all the elves in EQ2 have last names with an apostrophe in them like
Aa'Blob.  Would the ' be allowed and would the second capital letter be
retained?  It would be pretty poor if it didn't allow that format as
they set the standard for elf names themselves.

Just curious really as I'll probably not choose a last name anyway.
