You could say it, but I don't think it would be logical in that there
isn't necessarily a demonstrable correlation between a suit being
filed and a particular state of mind of the person initiating the action.
For example, it's not difficult to imagine what a mother feels when
she loses a son. The number of mothers who wouldn't be devastated
is close to being nonexistent I would guess. So to assume she was
any different in her feelings, would be a stretch.

However, her motivation to sue, could arise from a number
of factors:

--she could be a money-grubbing cold-hearted bitch.
--she could sincerely believe the game produced the suicide.
--she could have been convinced by an ambulance chaser
  it was the right thing to do to prevent similar events from 
  happening in the future.
--she could sue without expecting to win but in order to gain
  publicity for her cause.
--she could be trying to deflect focus from her own perceived
  responsibility for his death.

And so forth. For us to simply look at the fact she sued, and then
feel we can draw any valid conclusion from that, without any 
evidence about or knowledge of her, is not fair IMO.

I've been wrong before before. :-)

My reactions have a lot to do with the fact this subject was discussed before, 
many months ago, and the vile comments directed at the dead guy and
his mom, were truly shocking. Some scumbags were cheering the fact he 
killed himself, because after all he was a ' nothing ' .

The self-righteous twits were crawling all over themselves to denigrate 
him and his mom, blindly ignorant that what goes 'round, comes 'round, 
and there but the grace of God, fate, whatever, go us all.
