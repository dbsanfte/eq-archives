Huh?  What server is this on?  I agree that there are no pick-up
groups in Chardok (seen maybe 2 folks LFG while I was raiding),
Sebilis is full of people LFG.  For Bristlebane's sake, it's just
Lower-Lower Guk on Innoruuk.  If 53+ aren't LFG in Sebilis, do you
have 80 people in Velks Lab?  There's gotta be someplace to put 'em.

Any zone that alwasy has several groups in it will be good for LFG
types.  If there are 6 groups there, someone is leaving every few
minutes, sit your butt down where you zone it, advertise that you're
LFG, and wait until someone need to replace <your chartype here>.
It's really not that big of a deal.  OK, maybe you're not going to
just wander down to join Juggs, but every Juggs group I've seen
replacing folks has a CoH ready.
I also don't see your point about a long walk.  Both Seb and Chardok
are 2 zones away from both wizard and druid rings.  Both of them can
be reached from anywhere in the game in about 15 minutes, maximum.
Hell, both even have some semi-decent soloable mobs along the travel
path, though I recommend against trying the named that spawn as part
of froglok hunter/forager cycle.  I don't think anyone ever complained
the Lower Guk was three zones from a teleport.
