I've used the Hacker's Quest tool to look in the files, but only saw BMP,
WAV, and WLD files inside.  I did notice the sound effects were in their own
special files.  I didn't see any for the game music or find anything looking
like music files within the zone files.  Could you point out a specific one
of these "XMI" files you'd mentioned, where it is, so I'll see an example?
