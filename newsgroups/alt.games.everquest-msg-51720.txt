    The trip wire is in the Inn above the caster's guild, according to a
friend that stumbled across it. "Two floors from the top floor" is where he
described it - I have yet to investigate. It tried to cast Trepidation (high
level Fear spell) on him. It would be interesting to send in a rogue with
See Invis to see if they spot anything spawning or can disarm the trap.

    Heh. Sounds like the trap coding is a WEE bit off....

    I'm sure they'd claim they're being nice by adding a new quest for evils
(since not many good races will be poking around that guild area).
