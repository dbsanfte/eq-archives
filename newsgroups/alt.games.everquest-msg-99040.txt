Traders from EQ Traders Corner (www.eqtraders.com) would like to make the
following announcement:

Given the addition of /chat commands with the patch, Trade skillers around
the EQ world are promoting the adoption of a universal standard for
Tradeskills chat, which would allow you to converse with tradespeople on
your server. When you want to buy tradeskill made items, swap supplies, or
check a current price or recipe, just type "/join Tradeskills." If no one
else is in the channel, it should create the channel. If someone else has
created it, this should log you in to tradeskills chat. Please pass the word
on your server!!
