If he doesnt like the first person perspective he can change it, so his
point that non fps game are trash is moot, because EQ is both and more.

While you have me babbleing here I'll state I bought D2 becaus eof the over
head veiw and it was a nice break from the FSP thing, but the game was way
to repetetive (way more the EQ). I liked my chars and all but the same acts
over and over and over. Its not like playing a DE SK and then switching to a
Wood Elf Ranger and going back to Nek and stomping the guard flat for fun :)

I hope DS is much better. When the demo comes out I'll give it a whirl.

Have fun kids.
