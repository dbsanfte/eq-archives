Dammit!  You had druids and wizards to port you around?  Why back in
my day, there weren't any that were high enough level to even *know*
the spell.  Hell, we walked everywhere we wanted to go, and we were
proud when we got there.  

Now getting bound to where you where at was tricky, cuz there weren't
that many people in their teen's yet, so it cost you a pretty penny to
get yourself stuck at your new zone.  I can't believe you young-uns
and your Soulbinders!  Pfah!
