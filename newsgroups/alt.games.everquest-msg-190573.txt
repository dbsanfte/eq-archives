    He's the best at tanking in 90% of cases, and you want the other 10%.

    I know the other tank classes can solo, and I find this quite irrelevant
to an agro debate. If you want warriors to solo, fine with me, separate
issue.

    Why? Holding agro is the only tanking task we do better. Warriors beat
us in every other area. As a class in terms of DPS and capabilities they're
not overpowered - nobody's suggesting that - but we come second if every
area but one and you want that too. There is no balance in that whatsoever.

    Most cases they ARE. If people weren't so obsessed with the absolute top
end of the game they'd notice that. Knights win out, and not by a huge
amount, nobody's suggesting warriors CANT get a group in pop, and everyone
wants it changed. Give it a rest folks, the game's been about warriors and
clerics for FAR too long.

    I'm not the one complaining. I'm *perfectly* happy with the present
situation. I'm trying to provide a counterpoint to the Whining Warriors'
league, who ARE complaining because they're not "the best" in one area now.
