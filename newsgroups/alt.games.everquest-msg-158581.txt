Is this true? Can you confirm it anyplace? Because if so, that would be
wonderful. The major complaint about this spell on Graffes, from a whole
bunch of very experienced players, is the increased aggro from the DS.
If that's false, then this portion of it becomes merely "almost useless"
and less of an annoyance than "dangrous to the wizard's life".

The other effects of the spell (very long lasting lev and Fire Resist
out the wazoo) make it great to keep on all the time, but the DS was the
major concern for me.

You don't even have to be on a PvP server. :-(

Mages can DS anybody or any pet AFAIK. Of course, you can click it right
off. Then again, I don't use my pitiful wizzy DS much, and never played
a mage or druid, so I don't know that for sure. I'm kind of fuzzy on the
whole DS thing beyond having my warrior ask to have it on him when
tanking all the time.

Again, it was from a belief that it would build more aggro and help me
get more hate built up than any real sustained damage it would provide.
