Calling all undead-slaying Paladins.
Have you used Instrument of Nife since the last patch?
I went into Guk last night, stuck on Instrument of Nife and went to punish
some evildoers.
I took on the GIB room as it had already been broken by a passing party. Was
fighting the one GIB that was there, when pop...the other two appeared. I
was just about to run to zone, when all of a sudden...POW!...Condemnation of
Nife....then again...and again...and again. Took out the three dark blue
cons with only 1 1/2 HP bubbles gone! I tried it out again in the BR...same
thing happened.
Looks like Verant decided it was time pallies could solo a little.
