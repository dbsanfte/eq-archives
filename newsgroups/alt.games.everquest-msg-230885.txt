Well, if all the information I was interested in was housed on one page then
no.  However, I rarely find what I am looking for on the first page.  If I
am interested in a quest write up then I have to go to quests by zone, then
select my zone, and then select the quest.  After looking at the quest, I am
going to want to see the quest reward or perhaps the mobs involved, so each
of those means going to a new page that opens a new pop up window.  I think
it can become overwhelming if you don't close them as they come up.  If I
have several browser windows open with information I want to alt tab
between, pop up ads are an annoyance I prefer to avoid if possible.
