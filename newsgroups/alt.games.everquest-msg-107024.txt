    Can I use my cleric versus undead as a wizard in this example? I do from
261 to 273 damage for 130 mana with level 34 Expel Undead versus a wizard's
320 damage for 160 mana with level 34 Ice Shock, so the efficiencies should
be close.

    Clearing undead on dead side zone, Lower Guk (hence the use of level 34
spells). My cleric, when she was of age to XP there, would take seven to
eight minutes after a fight was finished to recover enough to initiate
another encounter. My warrior, when she was of age to XP there, would take
long enough to bandage at most ten times, then would be pulling the next
mob. My cleric, when soloing, would only receive any benefit from one buff:
Clarity would reduce her downtime. My warrior, when soloing, had lowered
downtime if someone cast haste on her, healed her, cast a damage shield on
her....

    Get the picture yet?

    My warrior beat the socks off my cleric at killing undead without any
external help, and any external help given was far more effective at
lowering the downtime of the warrior. Yes, warrior was twinked - 11/22
mainhand, 10/24 offhand, solid Crafted-level AC and HPs (with better in
hidden slots, like Spider Fur). Now imagine that warrior had a haste item.
Or better weapons than what she had. Or better armour. Or a Fungi. What
could my cleric have done to clear faster, other than partner with a
warrior?

    There might be DPS charts for a wizard with necromancer twitching on
Graffe's too, if you looked. Warrior, with cleric support versus wizard with
necromancer support would be about as close a parallel as you could get,
unless you want to substitute enchanter/bard for necromancer.
