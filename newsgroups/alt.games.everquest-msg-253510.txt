Complete this checklist:

1- Fear kite one of the boats in Dulak
2- Pet tank in Veksar
3- Agro kite a HoH basement, INCLUDING the sentries
4- Pull a LDoN adventure using your level 49 pet
5- Single pull giants at either the ocean, desert, or forest camps in Plane
of Storms
6- Keep 5 dots consistently applied to a raid mob for more than 2 minutes
without getting squished.

Do each of those until they become easy, and you will have the skills needed
to play a 65 necro well.

If you EVER go oom and need a med break, you lose! Unless you're twitching
someone of course, which, as a necro, you should resent and refuse except in
buff times or for rezzed cleric.
