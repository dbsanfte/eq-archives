Yes, I have gotten the first 4 cudgel's done, and have the two keys for the
5th. The potion does great. My suggestion however is to get non-Kos to
the Scaled Mystics, Crusaders, and Swifttails before entering Cabilis.

The best quest is in the Lake. Go to the explorer tower near the lake and
slaughter the explorers. They drop knives approx 50% of the time. Take
4 of them to the Warlord that is halfway between the lake itself and
the entrance to Cabilis. I went from Threatening with the Troopers to
max faction with my Inny Troll after 72 knives. Scowls to Dub with the
Mystics after 88 knives. Great quest, you lose faction with FV from killing
the explorers, but there is never a reason to go there anyways.

Good Luck,
Troy
