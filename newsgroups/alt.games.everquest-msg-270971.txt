Well it should! But for my dark elf I would rather burn the whole city
down then to live in a place like that. I just doubt that dark elves
would accomodate to such a low place.

Oh, surely there are some dreamer npcs who talk of the grand past of the
dark elven race. I'm afraid that I can't make myself clearer but it just
does not fit the picture I have of the dark elves.

On the other hand Qeynos should work with those compromises. After all
this is the *good* city! :)

But my gripe wasn't with Qeynos.

I think they made it simple. Just the good side against the bad side. No
shades inbetween. :/
