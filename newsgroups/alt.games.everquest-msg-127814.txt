Clara-net switched?

Dunno if Worldcom/MCI's problems would have any affect on net-routing...
unless there's some financial reason to switch, I wouldn't have thought that
was an issue.

BT(hawork/ptooie!) already runs most of the stuff going into LInX, and I
think MCI run a fair chunk of the trans-atlantic network... so you're
actually using both companies hardware before and after your ISP moved over.
