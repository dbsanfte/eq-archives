BAH !  i grouped with a PAL from 30-55 and im SK ... duo EVERYTHING , the
best part is you get heals, melee, DOTs, pet (if you can call it that)
Nukes, kited (aggro or fear).  I mean, fight undead and theres no stopping
it ...

im 56 with a ton of AA (got bored) and i crit for nasty dmg, cast crit is
nasty , PAL same thing ....

grab an SK for pulls as well ... the possabilites are endless with PAL/SK
