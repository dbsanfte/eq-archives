For some,  fast leveling is not the end all and be all of playing EQ. For you
it may be. For others it may not. There's no right or wrong here. No best way

and not an uncommon one at that. He asked for some constructive input not some
egocentric BS that tells him he's a stupid ass for kiting in Everfrost.
