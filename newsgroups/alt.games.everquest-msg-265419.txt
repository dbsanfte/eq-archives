Actually, kill stealing, as *I think of it* does exist. Remember that I 
don't care how 'CoH defines' it I'm really only concerned about how I 
define it, and since my definition is consistent with 'player 
convention' I'm not being unreasonable defining it that way.

You're the one who said they were inevitable in every game.

Newsflash: MUDs didn't invent killstealing either. It goes back much 
farther than that...ever since someone's neighbour snagged their 
favorite fishing hole or two hunters stalked the same prey... the 
concept of killstealing has been around since two people competed with 
eachother for same X.

It happens all the time. From the geonids in crystal caverns to the 
rockhoppers in dawnshroud to the turtles in natimbi.

Player convention by and large doesn't even have a problem with 
it...provided the people doing it are courteous, willing to share the 
area, particularly with xp groups, and not botting for yantis.

SOE doesn't recognize camps, nevermind claims over entire regions. But 
the players do, and that is what matters.

The GMs in EQ have some PR problems not because they don't handle 
killstealing, but because they have defined killstealing much narrower 
than the players have, and so far SOE has been unwilling to recognize 
this.

CoH is the same. It looks like the players all agree its possible to 
killsteal. The devs evidently refuse to acknowledge it.

What about a conversation about the election... supposing you've heard 
all you've wanted to hear about the election... now is that 'infringing 
on another players enjoyment of the game'?

What if you are hunting where I want to hunt? Isn't that infringing on 
another players enjoyment of the game?

What if I decide to share the mobs whether you want to share them or 
not. Should I petition you for infringing on my enjoyment of the game, 
or will you be petitioning me for infringing on yours.

Obviously such a ridiculous notion of harassment as this is something 
you must have plucked out thin air. Nobody half sane would suggest such 
a ridiculously vague policy.

Conventions are just as important as rules. Telling a customer that 
being an asshole isn't against the rules, that its just against 
convention isn't exactly savvy customer service.

If something becomes a convention, its often because its a good idea. 
Maybe it even should be a rule. Maybe someone should look into that...

Why should courtesy play second fiddle to mechanics? If conventions 
support ownership than I own it, even if the rules aren't sufficiently 
evolved. Its a sign that its time to update the rules.
