Is that 'will not work' as in, they already changed that on test, or as 
in, somebody on test noticed that they should change it, or... what, 
exactly?

I know I could VQ a level 29's pet as of night before last...

But I also know, for whatever reason, that if you charm a level 1 mob and 
cast pot9 on it, it only gains about 5 hp...  If it's level -2- it seems 
to get the full benefit though.
