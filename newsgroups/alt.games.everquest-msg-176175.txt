    This doesn't mesh with my experiences. Especially with the new model of
tradeskills in PoP, where the best tradeskill items are made with droppable
items from the top zones, you don't see "all there is to see" until well
into an expansion's life. Take Cazic-Thule trades as an example - the
majority of the leather, chain, and plate armours have yet to be created on
any server. So keeping discovery "fresh" by making the drops rare isn't
hard.

    And discovering new tradeskill products isn't the only reason people do
tradeskills. Some do it because they like buying and selling. For them,
being the person on the server with the most plat is an endgame goal, and
they use trades to realize that goal. The race to be "best trader" never
ends.

    You didn't do it for the love of tradeskills, did you? I was always
under the impression you were a "means to a goal" trader - one who makes
items for sale in order to buy droppable gear you couldn't, or wouldn't,
camp yourself. They're tradeskillers, too, but only for as long as it takes
to get what they want. People who raised tradeskills for the Coldain shawls
would likely fall in this category too.

    For some, especially those that enjoyed haggling with customers. But
consider the benefits: ability to leave a mule on and trade while gathering
supplies, ability to buy supplies at a much faster rate from Bazaar vendors.
I'll use Teyvan, the first 250 skill tailor on my server, as an example.
While his Bazaar mule is left online, selling what he's made, he goes from
tier one plane to tier one plane, advertising to buy desired tradeskill
components. As he gets stuff made, it goes on the mule, he skims off some of
the cash from sales to buy more supplies, he does a quick check of The
Bazaar for any supplies in his price range, and he's back out hustling for
more. He used to pay one of his guildmates to sell his stuff for him, and
had to trust that guildmate to negotiate reasonably. Now, there is no
haggle - pay the price or don't get the goods. And considering the quality
of the goods you can make these days, people will pay.

    It doesn't hit tradeskill items as much because there's a fairly large
time and money cost to becoming a "good enough" tradeskiller in a lot of
trades. The items being made for sale require high skill to manufacture.
Verant has even tried to put in time sinks on trades that already had a lot
of 250 skill people, like Jewel Crafting Mastery for JC. Had the current
model been in force since day one on all servers, tradeskills would be
amazingly viable across the board, with a very sustainable price on all
goods. You might be surprised how well prices are holding on the items I
sell as a tailor.

    To the people that like to haggle when selling, yes, without a doubt.
But for people that use tradeskills as their own personal business
simulations, I imagine it'll be loads of fun.
