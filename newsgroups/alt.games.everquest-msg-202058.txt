lvl 57 bard now... Just wondering where fellow bards are fighting at.  You
guys grouping?  The charm we have stops at I believe 52 Mobs so fighting a
Mob that much lower isn't that good for xp but we are not left with much
alternative right???   Just getting other peoples opinions.  I am in PoD now
fighting rats and flys.  Boy it gets boring sometimes.  I am waiting to lvl
64 before getting AA points.  Thanks again
