Well my groups always have a shaman AND cleric.   I don't use a chanter for
execution.

I passed the trial at 61 (monk) using my bot shaman (60) with a guild rogue
(62) and his bot cleric (61) and 2 other guildies (forget who)

You can call some of my guildies uber all you like, but my shaman and his
cleric are as far from uber as you can get.

Maybe you had bad luck?  Or grouped with a moron?

The trials really aren't anywhere near as difficult as you made out,
honestly.  And only 2 were high DPS encounters.
