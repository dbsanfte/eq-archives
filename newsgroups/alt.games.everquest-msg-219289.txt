Aye - like everything in life, taste and opinion have a large part to
play - so far my ideal LDoN group would have to be.

1 x Tank
2 x high DPS
1 x enchanter (slow and cc)
2 x healer (pref. chealers)

Tank to well, erm, pull and tank.
DPSers to kill the mobs
Enchanter to slow and control crowds
Healers to overlap - take turns - to keep the momentum going.

Tank preference - paladin - but one that realises that chain stunning
is NOT always necessary, but one that uses stun when necessary.

DPS - don't give a toss really - wizard, necros, rogues, monks, etc.
etc. - whoever can deal lots of damage efficiently.  Melees have a
slight advantage for me because of not having to worry about mana.

Enchanter - goes without saying really - but at a push a damned good
bard would do.

Healers - complete healing is nice to have any day of the week.  So I
would say at least one cleric - but clearly the alternate / secondary
healer could be non cheal capable.

At the 50 plus level - the only successful groups I have had have been
when I have been playing my paladin or my enchanter and high pace has
been the key to success.

In the 30-40 range I had a great experience playing my Cleric in
support of a certain Mrs. Evans playing her Paladin.

The rest of the time - I have been disappointed with a certain "slow"
paladin who I shall be discrete enough not to name here.

Unusual for me I know - but hey ho.

LOL
