No... as a long time veteran of UO (pre-beta) I don't think there is
any one thing they did that screwed the game up MORE than the addition
of housing, especially in the way it was done.  In a 2d world, with
sprites, the lag was so horrible as to be undescribable.

Add to that the sheer number of exploits that were introduced into the
game (based on game mechanics, not player greed or stupidity) and it
became a nightmare.

Now try to throw that mix into a 3d world, with a much larger user
base, with a 'flowing' world scene, and the lag will be worse than can
be imagined... just think of warsliks woods while being snared and
tugor'd....

Only change I would like to see is a difference in the way the bank
vaults work.  instead of limitations based on slots, a more UO like
interface based on weight/item count.  Either that, or raise the stack
limit above 20... making this shaman's life a lot easier.  Far easier
to make pots on demand, instead of having to store 10 shots in a
slot...
