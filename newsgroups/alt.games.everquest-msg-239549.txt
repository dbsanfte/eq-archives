I hear Lineage has promise. A friend of mine wants me to join up with
him in the open Beta. Supposedly it has siege warfare where you can
capture castles, and the character advancement is kind of like AAs.
You level and get skill points, which can be spent on purchasing
levels of abilities and spells. Looks like a lot of fun, but since I
just tried Horizons with this same friend, and hated it, I'm a little
wary.
