 Well being perma-effect means you don't get the buff icon so it's not
very useful against dispellers. If you just need the EB component it's
more than sufficient.

 As for Grachnist... He's the only one who drops the earring. However,
it's his rare drop. Unless you get lucky you'll be seeing a lot of
gloves dropping. It's more an exercise in boredom than a challenge to
get this item. On the bright side, if you're a race that is KoS in
Firiona Vie you'll more than likely get non-KoS trying to get this item.
And yes, there can be more than one up. Just keep clearing the fort.
I've spent at least 20 hours total there and have yet to see an earring.
