  I'll do you one better, I'll answer it in one sentence:
  "It depends."
  Actually, I think most of the frequently asked questions in this
newsgroup could be answered with that sentence.
  Seriously though, my answer to that question usually goes something
like this:
  "To answer this question you have to ask yourself what is important to
you.  If you're familiar with other RPGs and games of this nature, you
probably know that each character will have his or her strengths and
weaknesses, and that no single class/race combo will give you all the
good with none of the bad.  The question to ask is not what is the best
race/class combo is the best, but to ask which is best for YOU.  The
best way to answer this question is to learn about all of the classes
and races, and make your decision based on that knowledge."
  And then there would be questions like, "What's the deal with
barbarians?" and "What are necromancers like?" where there's a
description of the class, their strengths, weaknesses and other
miscellaneous information.
