If EQ isn't in the DEFAULT directory (I think it's c:\program
files\everquest) when you upgrade to Velious you may run into problems.  At
least, I did.  Anyway.  Yeah, reinstall, it couldn't hurt.

But first reboot then (assuming Win9x) hit alt-ctrl-del and End Task
everything but Explorer and Systray (one of which may not even be running
yet).  That way you're sure to have a clean install.

Odd that a PICTURE file bombed out the install.
