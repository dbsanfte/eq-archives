The word for *genocide* in the Middle East is "Intafada"  or "Intifada";
apparently in terms of spelling, you can take your pick.

Now you take a person like the author of this thread, and what you do is,
like, you create an understanding in his head: First you let him know that
you respect his First Amendment right to blither anything he likes.  In
turn, you will expect him to respect any Jew's Second Amendment right to
bear arms, and to use those arms according to his discretion--whether in
obedience or disobedience of the law, since naturally, with a right to bear
arms the choice and responsibility of that free exercise, as to whether it
is used lawfully or not just really does come down to the guy with his
finger on the trigger.  The law of the land in the Second Amendment just has
conferred upon this Jew who hates the very life of an Anti-Semite to decide
whether in exercise of his right he will obey or break the law; the law
rendering his right has given him the right of that option, to blow every
living breathing lying Anti-Semite clean away, like so much dirt.

BONNIE:  Oh boy?  What is the matter with this automobile?

CW:  Dirt.

BONNIE: Well, what do you mean 'dirt', boy?

CW:  Well, Ma'am, you've got dirt in your carburetor.

BONNIE:  And you fixed it?

CW:  I just blowed it clean away.

The Second Amendment conferring a sort of implied right to blow some of that
Anti-Semite dirt clean away, right out of the social/cultural carburetor
might be construed as a sort of "check and balance" upon the First Amendment
to a right of Free Speech. We exercise our First Amendment rights in full
knowledge of what may be the consequences of shooting our mouths off any way
we like.  Thanks to the American Revolution we do have that right to say any
crazy, dangerous, damned fool thing that turns us on, despite the
consequences that may come upon us from the Second Amendment that flows
directly upon the First.  What consequences?

Well!  Since the government is not permitted to stop some Anti-Semite damned
fool from publishing any kind of slander he may like about people, then it
is a free people that this Anti-Semite has to . . . consider for the
consequences that might be forthcoming as flowing from the words that have
issued from his dirty, twisted, lying mouth.  At any time, some Jew
somewhere might be of a mind to think that the only way to instill an
understanding in the Anti-Semite's
head would be to implant the whole idea in his head hard and fast like it
was a .38 slug shot clean from the muzzle of Truth.

No two ways about it; words can be bullets.  In the Germany of the late
twenties and early thirties a lot of word lead and hot sizzling speech
shrapnel was flying around, but damn few Jews really thought that just a
crumby, middling bunch of Free Speech driven words and propaganda could ever
come to anything like the murder of Six Million people!  Guess what?

That's all it took.

Words, paranoiac damned fool ideas, speeches, marches, elections and
shazzam!  Here's Auschwitz come down out of the clear sky of free and
unfettered speech like Groucho's Duck bouncing on the end of the string with
the Secret Word "Final Solution" on a card dangling from its neck.  Before
the Death Camps were built of concrete and lumber they were built of words,
just words, a free flow of words, both open and secret.

Jews know that now, or leastways they should.  Some Jews realize that
there's only one way to get the right idea across to an Anti-Semite:  give
him a full taste of his own medicine by a lot more than words, but by the
well-proven deadly consequence of such words.

We really ought to know by hindsight of the Holocaust that anyone who is
worthy of the life he is living would never be caught dead speaking the kind
of words that led to the Holocaust last time.  Nobody worth the priceless
quantity of the air he breathes on this earth would be talking like that
again, even though he has every right so to do--and face the consequences.

So, those who do talk like that really ought to understand what can come of
talk like that.  What's good for the Jewish Duck is good for the Goy Gander.
Take a gander, Mr. or Mrs.Anti-Semite:  You are now living in the post Third
Reich World with the kind of Jews who will stand for no more of it; the kind
of Jews who would be more than happy to give such an Anti-Semite a taste of
those terrible consequences that came last time from such harmless little
words. We talkin' a little bit of "preventative medicine."  Just a little
taste of Xyklon B in the air of Anti-Semitic salon.

Of course, everybody around here knows that I, "Jervis" am "not
Jewish", so what skin is it off my nose?  I should care less whether such an
Anti-Semite lives or dies.  But out there somewhere, I can just about
guarantee that in view of the poison this guy's been posting, there is sure
to be a Jew who would like nothing more than to find that guy and bash his
face against a wall until his empty cranial cavity cracked open to reveal
that sucked egg for a head it really is there.

If Jews have learned *anything* in this world it is this:  being nice about
it doesn't work.

Yep.  If I was a Jew (which of course, according to both Jew and Gentile I
am not) and I was a rich one at that, I guess there's nothing I'd like
better to do with my last few vital years remaining to me on earth than to
go around the world hunting Anti-Semites like this guy and so I could sort
of start dropping a little Xyklon B down their air conditioner ducts.  I
would just keep thinking about that little face of Anne Frank, those poor
little kiddies with those tattoos on
their arms . . . And I'd go hunting. :-)

Jeez, I wish I was Jewish!
