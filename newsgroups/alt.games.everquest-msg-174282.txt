Maybe if you can minimize the lag. I tried it for all of an hour
before scrapping the whole idea. In a newbie area with two other
people and sparse mob population, it continually froze for ten seconds
or more at a time from lag and connection instability. Maybe it's just
my packet route, I don't know. I have not seen that with EQ.

the graphics were nice, but I think the character selection is too
wierd. I'm just not fond of the races and the character models. I mean
dog/jack-rabbit/human hybrid thingies? Nasally-challenged Incredible
Hulk look-alikes? I just can't bring myself to take that seriously.
Same for DAoC. The character models just look cheesy to me.
