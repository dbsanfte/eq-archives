I've been having this trouble a lot since the LDoN patch.  I'd
say 50% of the time, when I zone, I go LD.  Before the patch this
happened too, of course, but 1% of the time or less.

This is particularly annoying with LDoN, of course; with normal
grouping, I go to a zone, I LFG, get group, play for a few hours,
log off, never having zoned once after getting an invite to a
group.

With LDoN, I'm sitting in POK with my LFG flag up.  Get invite to
say EC tunnel, thats zone to Freeport (maybe crash) zone to EC
(maybe crash) then form up, get mission, zone to mission zone
(maybe crash) zone into dungeon (maybe crash) leave dungeon
(maybe crash) and perhaps zone again to vendor (maybe crash yet
again).  Six zone attempts, I tend to crash about three times per
mission... and the mission itself is only an hour or so long,
which means in the same 4 hour time span I'm likely to crash out
six or nine times!

Those are normal "oops, disconnected and dumped to server select"
crashes, too, again tonight I crashed to the disconnected screen
and froze there until I rebooted my computer (cold boot, had to
hit the button cause it wouldnt' even respond to the three finger
salute)

Is there a solution for this out there?  Is it even a recognized
fault since the patch?  Or am I the only one, heck, perhaps if so
its something on my end, although I can't think of anything on my
system that changed within the past few weeks that might even
seem to be coinciding with the LDoN release patch.

Splendid
