It wasn't the underlying language that I disliked. In fact, when my
boss asked me "Do you know VB?", my answer was "Not now, but I can by
Monday". Basic is pretty straightforward, and VB similarly so if you
already have a grasp of OOP. Which I do.

I didn't like the environment much - Delphi has an extremely
sophisticated and refined IDE, and I'm spoiled.

What I really disliked was the ActiveX aspect. I'll just cut that rant
short right there - I was well into my second paragraph already :)

I cannot recommend Delphi enough. If you want to toy around with it, I
believe Borland has a free demo version on their site.

Always a silver lining.
