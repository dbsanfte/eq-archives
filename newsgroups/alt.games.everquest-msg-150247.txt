    Guild warrior has a non-weapon in Primary (Geerlock Smithing Hammer, to
be specific), a Blade of Carnage in secondary. He's trying to test if his
new Call of Sky buff procs on the off-hand. Even though primary hand cannot
swing because it's not a weapon, secondary hand is swinging away cheerfully.

    Others have posted more standard tests, like Wurmslayer/Jade Mace, which
will show you that offhand swings independent of main hand, but the above
makes it pretty obvious. ;-)
