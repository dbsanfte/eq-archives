Its not realy 5% difference... let me explain....
A 65% slowed mob atacks at 35% speed
A 70% slowed mob attacks at 30% speed

The difference in dps is 14%. Its not a lot, but certainly worth the 25
mana.
Also if youre slowing mezzed mobs (as you should) and someone wakes it, that
14% might be the difference between a remez and an interrupt/wipeout.

I still use tepid deeds a lot for ldon. The mobs dont hit as hard, die
faster, and forlorn deeds is just to slow and expensive in some groups. It
depends on the group.
