Its very useful. Frequently there are cases where are 2 clusters of
mobs close together.  And a mob that wanders.

Assuming no lulling. If you pull the wanderer when he's safely out of
the area you'll get him all by himself, but no easy way to proceed. If
you pull any mob in either cluster social aggro pulls both clusters. .

But If you pull the wanderer when he's a little closer to the  near
cluster you will end up with the first cluster + wanderer. This vastly
superior to ending up with both clusters. I use this tactic all the
time.

Hmm there could be something to that.

 ie if a socially aggroed mob has bad pathing and runs through other
mobs he might aggro them (i can't think of any good example at the
moment).

So socially aggroed mobs might actually just have a dramatically
reduced agro range... I would be surprised if there was a diminishing
condition where it differentiated between socially aggroed and
socially aggroed by socially aggroed...

You'd need sets of the *same* social mobs evenly spaced. Aggro radius
is a mob characteristic, not a game constant.
