Label me as a troll if it makes you feel like a big man, but I truely
doubt that you went to playerauctions to verify the facts.  You're too
busy being Mr Important.  If you did, you see what I'm talking about.
Yantis is selling billions of plat from a marco or a corrupt GM on the
EQ system.  Sure, Yantis has sold pennies in the past, well he's
selling hundred dollar bills now for pocket change.
