Actually, two bards grouped, each swarm kiting is better than each bard 
swarm kiting individually.  They get the grouping bonus, but otherwise 
play as though soloing.  Only tricky part is being sure to remain close 
enough to each other to both get xp from kills.  That might even make it 
too hard, not sure on exactly what that distance needs to be.  Of course 
availability of mobs for two bards to swarm kite would be an issue as 
well.
