Unpredictability definitely adds to the excitement though last night when I 
was chased across four zones from Ruins ofValmarr to Xroads by three mobs I 
was seeing an advantage to zones )
- even then it was the guards who stopped the buggers

Ideally different mobs would all have different pursuit lengths and these 
would vary a bit as well.
