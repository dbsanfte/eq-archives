You bring up a very valid point that I had forgotten (been playing too
long, and I am much too jaded :-P). I agree 1000% with the thrill and
adventure that can be found travelling between zones the first couple
of times. One of the neatest things Verant did with Velious was
forcing players to travel by foot to the port locations to get a
"tooth" before being able to use the group port spells. You got the
thrill of travel, but you didn't have to make the tedious run every
time. Unfortunately the system took up inventory space, and was doomed
to failure. I was more glad to see it go, than I was sad over the loss
of the "thrill". Too bad they didn't have the character "flagging"
process that they have implemented with PoP. Come to think of it, it
would have been great if you had to visit each Teleportation book on
foot (or through group ports) before you could use them to get to the
Plane of Knowledge. Definately a better Role-Play implementation than
just loading the registering the new expansion..

The only "value" that was reduced was the value in plat-per-hour they
could make selling ports. 

I played on a blue server for almost 3 years before moving to FV. You
would be amazed how many people played/botted Druids for only 1
reason.....Port-Mule. 99% of these "Droods" are halflings (5% exp
bonus and best starting stats). Instead of playing and learning the
class they would level as quickly as possible (generally with PLing
help). Often they would disrupt whole zones (camping newbie guards,
etc) or train other players in their mad dash to level 29. Across all
blue servers the most despised Race/Class combo has got to be
Halfling/Druid. 

No other class is hated or looked down on the way Druids are in
general. It really is sad, and I truly hope that the recent changes
restore some respect to the class. I hope anyone who created a
Druid/Wizard just to sell ports quits the class and never goes back.
