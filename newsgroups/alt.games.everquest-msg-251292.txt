I suppose if horses were used realistically, you'd end up with complications
about the fact that unless you had a 'heroic' version then your steed
wouldn't last long. Then again, look how tough wolves are in DSP! They could
tackle a wooly mammoth I suspect.

 http://www.classicalfencing.com/articles/shock.shtml has an interesting
discussion (and great pictures) and the author argues that mounted combat
sans stirrup was quite possible, even lancing:

"
Where then, do the stirrups come in?

Most beginning riders understand the usefulness of the stirrup as a mounting
aid in getting on the horse's back. Useful, but not necessary. Stirrups
enable the rider to endure longer marches in greater comfort. Stirrups are a
logical step in progression to aid in "rising" from the seat, which must be
accomplished from the knees without them. Any rider trained in "English"
will recall the hard work of "posting" without stirrups as a way to develop
leg muscles and seat. They are perhaps best employed in assisting the rider
to "rise" in his seat and so isolate the movement of his body from that of
his horse. Such isolation is most helpful in firing projectile weapons like
bows. This is likely the reason why the stirrups originated in the great
horse cultures of the east, which are known as excellent mounted archers.

Additionally, the stirrups can be useful before the impact, to brace the
rider more firmly against the cantle. The moment of impact however, tends to
pull the rider's feet up and back - or otherwise "out" of the stirrups.

Useful, yes. But are they "necessary" for the shock of the charge with
couched lance? Not especially. To test the effect of the stirrups, one has
only to remove them from the saddle and try the pass without them. I have
accomplished many successful passes at the quintain without stirrups, with
no appreciative loss in the force of impact."

Further along he says:

"A wall hanging discovered in a 5th century tomb in Pazyryk, clearly shows a
Sarmatian rider mounted on a ridged saddle tree with pronounced pommel and
cantle but no stirrups. This is illustrated in The Complete Book of Horse
and Saddle Equipment published by Exeter Books, 1981. An extract follows:

  "To the east of the Scythians there lived another horse people, the
Sarmatians. Unlike the Scythians, the Sarmatians fought as a heavy cavalry,
using a long heavy lance which the Greeks called a "barge-pole", and wearing
armor. The Sarmatians, using this heavy lance, were probably the first
troops to charge bodies of infantry in the accepted cavalry fashion." p 21"
