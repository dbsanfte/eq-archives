> You don't tell us your class, but to summarize my general position: <

Yes, I'm sorry, I realised after I had posted .. I'm a Wizard and stay well
and truly out of dungeons for the most part due to the fact that I need room
to manouvre with root, nuke, snare and so on. I'll take a look at the link
you kindly posted, see if that helps.

Regards ...

Stevie.
