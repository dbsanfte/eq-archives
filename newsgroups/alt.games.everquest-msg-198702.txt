Karnor's Castle: over the first bridge just beyond the stairs up to
Dog Capt are two Dog spawns either side of the second bridge, I could
stand at zone in and plink arrows at these until they die without
them ever moving an inch.  Combined bow and arrow range would be
about 400-425 which I assume is well outside the chase radius.

Almost certainly classed as an exploit so don't do it for free xp,
mkay. :)
