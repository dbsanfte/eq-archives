How insightful. You blasted me for not knowing anything about
multiboxing. SK's make it easy to multibox due to thier nice aggro
spells and abilities. If you are playing 2+ systems and the mob is
running about, what happens is that the other alts stand there and do
nothing while you try to establish the aggro or do a root or what not.
When the sk establishes the aggro (if you do it right) you are free to
do focus on the other systems to have them do thier job.
