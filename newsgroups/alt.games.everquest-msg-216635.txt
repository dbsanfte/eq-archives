It's not something I experienced myself, since I was running through my
30s and 40s when PoP came in. It's a common "complaint" on the eqcleric
forums, however - that with Luclin high-level groups, a druid could handle
healing for most camps with no trouble - cleric healing was overkill for
anything short of raid MOBs.

Personally I didn't encounter the often rumoured "LFG clerics get snapped
up instantly" until my late 50s (say 58+)

Of course, some of the same people say that they can't get groups *now*
but the people complaining always seem to be in elemental-plus guilds
where an excess of clerics immediately following a raid would be expected.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
