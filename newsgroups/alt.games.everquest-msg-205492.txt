Because it's a reasonable judgement, all things considered.  Or do
you only accept judgements that are backed by uniforms, firearms,
and prisons?

Well, it is customary to conform to social mores in a social setting.
People who refuse suffer from various sanctions, depending on a huge
host of variables.  Your complaint here is rather patheticly immature,
do you intend to spend the rest of your life in junior high school?
As you go through life getting dumped on by people and institutions
at every opportunity, you might want to stop and consider whether it
isn't your own selfish, stupid, and short-sighted immaturity, rather
than some vast conspiracy, that makes your life so empty and devoid
of meaning.
