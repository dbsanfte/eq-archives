I recommend invis-to-undead as well as regular invis in Illsalin.  Get
a 10-dose potion if you cant cast it yourself.  Most things there are
blind to ITU.  However there are a few to watch for that are living,
including some deep orcs in a room near a broken bridge on the upper
right side (upper right as you enter the zone--you can avoid them),
gargoyles (which you would never need to be near for this), and
splorgraths (sp?) which swim around in the water outside the arena and
in the tunnels under the arena.  The only time you really need regular
invis, then, is when running across the water outside the arena and
during one section where you have to enter those water tunnels under
the arena and then swim through some of those splor-whatever.  You do
have room to switch back and fourth there through, far enough away from
the zombies and the squid things to not agro while casting a different
invis.
