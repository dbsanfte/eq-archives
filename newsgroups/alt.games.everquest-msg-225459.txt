I've been doing the same thing, saving up for about 50K (at  least) worth of
spells.  And of course since I have most of them up to KEI, I'm tempted to
buy my new necromancer a lizard.  Hold me back.  If you want to pair up at
some point (or just watch each other's backs), lemme know.  Doing it gets
boring after a while, LOL.

I was Kelori then, I think, or just Kay.  I started the Breathe char
later--she replaced Kelori, my Shaman.

I noticed a 49 necro who's name started with Dav in RM tonight, too, while
Davbow wasn't there.  Hmm.
