As your first character, without being twinked, PL'ed or knowing anyone on
the server or ever having even played the game before?  Mighty impressive.

Bullshit, but mighty impressive bullshit.  =P

I'm sure you are quite wrong, because that's exactly what I'm saying.  Go
start a character on EQ and play it like it's a new game and tell me how
long it takes you to get to 70.  Now do that while simultaneously raiding in
WoW 4 or 5 hours a night, 4 or 5 days each week (you don't even have to be
running a guild, doing dkp, roster, news, board moderation, leadership
discussion, etc., just play the in-game time).  See ya in six months, at
best.

Foot print?  Better?  WoW isn't a hard game.  I actually like it for the
most part and think it's a very well-designed game.  It's just too casual
for me.  I can play with reckless abandon with little fear of getting in
over my head, leveling at a tremendous rate of speed the whole time.  EQ is
undoubtedly "harder" than WoW.  And I am undoubtedly good at every game I
play, personality thing ya know, so I'm not sure that's even a point worth
responding to.  =)

For me, though, the sheer volume and variety of content coupled with a more
unforgiving design concept make EQ a more immersive and enjoyable long-term
game.  I had a blast in WoW.  Then I canceled.
