not trying to say that sitting and medding is fun, but it is part of the
game - a part of the game that has always been there and should have 
been there the whole time.  KEI might have helped to eliminate this in

fix, late or not.

eh, habit i picked up several years ago...just never really worried 
about silly things like capitalization or proper grammar in newsgroups, 
email, or IM....makes it a beyatch to concentrate on anything i write 
for school/work/etc though
