A sniffer can only get the packets that go through, or past his/her

I know how a sniffer works,  and a Skript kiddie isn't going to be
taking the time to browse through 1-2 million packets to find the one
that contains the password.  Even if he has a parser, and gets it down
to the 100-200K packets that go to the Everquest servers.  He may not
get lucky enough to get both the password packet, and the Username
packet.

well, I'm not on a university campus, I'm not on a Cable modem.  Anyone
with a de-compiler can pluck out the reg key check and reverse engineer
it, has nothing to do with cracking something that likely uses an
asymetrical key.

try 5 hours to create and to parse 26!-(26-10)!=963761198400 strings you
are talking on the order of days.

If the user name and password go in the same packet.

28 servers??* 8 chars per server BAH.

Thats right, IF THEY COME ACROSS your path.

I would recommend you read it before talking about it.

learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
