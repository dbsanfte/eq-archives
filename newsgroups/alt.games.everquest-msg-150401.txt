I don't think he's disagreeing with you here.  He's disagreeing with my
thought that if there was no cash to be had that exp groups or soloers
could go after the HGs in peace.  Since (he claims) exp sucks off them,
noone would be there for the exp.  COuld be he's right, I killed them
in my early 30s as a bard, but not so much for the exp as for the
experience.... was challenging and fun and they were soooooo big
the ground shook when they fell.  Plus I've sworn off killing Velious
giants with  him (he's not KOS to them OR to coldain) so I had to
look further afield for my giantslaying fun.  Does seem to me the exp
was decent, mind you.

Wouldn't it be handy if there was a pickpocket success message, like the
annoying fletching success messages and so forth we get spammed with
during fights, to make it clear whether you are stealing or not?

Hmm, but you could drag or summon bodies of clerics and druids who
have grouped with you in the past, since you know they, at least, aren't
part of the "won't group with rogues" contingent, while we can't say
"I've grouped with her, she didn't steal" (best we can do is "she didn't
steal outlandishly")

Yes, I see you do agree.
