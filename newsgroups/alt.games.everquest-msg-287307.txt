If you had a level 50 (which is the max level) character somewhere on 
your account, then there was a "/level" command you could use on other 
characters, that would, if they were under level 20, give them enough XP 
to put them in level 20.

There were some limits, though.  In particular, when they introduced new 
classes, they started restricting /level on those classes.  They would 
remove the restriction when the classes had been in the game long enough 
that plenty of people had reached high level with them.

There were some amusing consequences of this.  Like level 20's wandering 
around the newbie area, begging level 2's and 3's for silver so they 
could afford a horse ride to a major city. :-)  (The smart way to do it 
was to not /level right away, but rather kill things to level 2 (takes 
about 5 kills), then talk to a guard to get a kill task.  The guard will 
give you some local animal to kill.  Kill it, then go /level, and come 
back to the guard for your reward.  He gives you a reward appropriate 
for a level 20 kill task, not a level 2 kill task, and that gives you 
plenty of money for a horse ride).

However, this kind of thing would not really help with the problem you 
are trying to address, unless you could skip a lot of levels.  Just 
skipping 20 or so wouldn't make all that much difference on the way to 
70 or 80.

City of Heroes has an interesting solution to the problem of your 
friends being too high level for you to play with them.  But first, a 
very short note about powers in CoH.  As you level up, you get new 
powers, but your old powers also get stronger, so you don't stop using 
them.  It's not like EQ, where when you get your new spells, you are 
likely to completely stop using some of your old spells.

CoH has the concept of a sidekick.  Say you are a level 30 hero.  I'm 
level 10.  We want to play together.  You invite me to be your sidekick.  
What happens then is that my powers are boosted to near level 30, when 
I'm within a certain distance of you.  I don't gain any new powers, so I 
only have the powers that a level 10 of my class could have--but they 
operate as if I were around 30.  I believe other stats are boosted 
appropriately, too.  The net result is that I will be able to meaningful 
contribute, and not be so fragile as to be a burden, on level 30 fights.

CoH also allows you to do it the other way.  Instead of me being your 
sidekick, you could be my mentor.  That temporarily *lowers* your skills 
and abilities to just above me level, so we can go on missions 
appropriate to my level, and you can help.  This is particularly nice.  
Say I have a level 10 quest that I'm having trouble with.  I could ask 
my level 30 friend for help, and he can mentor me and help.

This kind of thing could work in EQ, with some tweaking of how spell 
effects scale, and things like that.
