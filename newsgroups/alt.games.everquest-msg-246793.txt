For what it's worth from a lowlie 59.75 shaman of the nameless, I have
always looked forward to your posts, Winterfury.  I have appreciated the
guidance and knowledge that you have given to me over the past 8 or 9 months
that I've been lurking around these boards.

I, too, enjoy the adventures of Monual immensely, and in a way, you have
been the Monual of my class.  I have lived a little through your stories of
what adventures I may one day be lucky enough to see through my own
barbarian eyes.

I understand the circle, I am just glad that our circles crossed, and that I
was able to be the benefactor of that.

May all your slows land, and may you always resist their dots!

Fairwell, friend.
