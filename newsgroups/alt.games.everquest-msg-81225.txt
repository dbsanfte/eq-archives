This is being discussed on the safe house right now as part of the
monk/rogue weapon thread. Because backstab has a relatively high
delay, does an amount of damage strongly affected by weapon damage
and makes up a sizable proportion of a rogues offensive power a better
damage is worth a slightly worse ratio.

*apart from that* a fast weapon with a good ratio is the best choice
for your main hand. This is in order to maximize your primary hand
damage bonus which counts once per strike. Your offhand weapon can
be selected purely on the basis of ratio.

That said the point I was making is that availability and affordability
are also elements that most people will need to consider. The grimling
miners pick might have worse stats but be affordable and available. The
weapon i'm most interested in, a rabid chokidai fang, is unavailable.
Many other weapons I would like are unaffordable.

Mind you i'm sort of happy I don't have ultimate weapons. That would
result in the mob demonstrating that I don't have ultimate armor.
