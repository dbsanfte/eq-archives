Speaking of outpacing... I've noticed something wierd now that I hit 60:

1 - Alot of people over 60 don't want to do LDONs with anyone under 60 because
they say experience sucks.
2 - Alot of people only want to do planes.
3 - Alot of the Planes dwellers only want to do BOT because of the great
experience, so anyone without a flag or not 62 are *out*.
4 - Alot of the elemental planers only want to do elemental planes - (as I'm
not a EPer I haven't quite figured this out... perhaps someone can clarify
what's up with this).
5 - At any one time on TP from 8 - 10 PM there will be 40 or more people over
level 60 LFG.  You still can't get a group together because of #1 - 4!
