I don't think there is.  There is no newbie armor quests on all of Odus.
Thinking I'd get the best of the game and head to Freeport, the closest
place for newbie armor quests, I find out that they are human only.

I wish they would put more newbie armor quests in Qeynos and Odus.  I guess
for now the erudites are shit out of luck.
