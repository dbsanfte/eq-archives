There you go missing the point again. The big issue isn't that it isn't 
  'free'. The issue is that you have to buy something you do not want 
and which is unrelated to get it. If it were simply 9.95 to get a cd set 
shipped out... I'd still be a touch irate because I still view betas as 
an expense not a revenue source, but I wouldn't be nearly as outraged.

I find it amazing so many people are having such a hard time seeing this.
