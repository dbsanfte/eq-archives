> Sigh. He is a troll, and trolls do not provide clarification.

If he's a troll, then we need more trolls like him.  His trolling has
sparked an intellegent debate (I many disagree with the moral relativists,
but I won't try to slander their intellect, I hope they show the same
regard).  He is also at least moderatly familiar with the topic matter.
Also, he poses his points as questions, and backs up his points, instead of
making unsubstantiated claims.  Not exacltly normal trolling tactics.
