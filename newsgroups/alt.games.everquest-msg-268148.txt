level 15-20 should give you a fair idea of the play of your class for the
newbie and midgame.  You don't get the good/evil class specialization until
level 20, so you kind of have to look at spell lists and guess beyond that.

Nobody knows how different the endgame will be.  It's quite possible that,
like EQ1, most high-level classes play rather differently from the way they
did at mid-level.   And even if they don't now, they may after a few
expansions.

It's impossible to know what "enough" is if you're having fun.  If you're
not, that's enough right there.  I believe this is a good thing.

For some things, you'll probably know before you get off newbie isle.  Maybe
you hate root/nuke, so being a mage isn't for you.  For others, you may have
fun through level 35 and then get bored, or be annoyed with some game
mechanic that gets important around that level.

The important thing is you have fun WHILE experimenting.  When it stops being
fun, try another character (or game).  This could be years from now, or weeks.
