This suggestion only applies if you have a BroadBand Internet
connection(like DSL or RoadRunner).  You can purchase a Router for around
forty dollars.  Put the Router between your BroadBand Modem and your home
network.  If all you have is one PC then put it between the modem and your
computer.  When you play EQ, disable your firewall.  The Router will do a
much better job of protectiing your computer and you will not lose the extra
processing time that you are now since you are running a program on top of
another program(firewall running while EQ is running).  If you are careful
with what you download then you can totally get rid of the firewall and just
run your comptuer behind the Router.

Since my gaming system is just for gaming I even turn off the anti-virus
program while running EQ.  Every service(program) that you can turn off
while running EQ will help the game to run smoother.
