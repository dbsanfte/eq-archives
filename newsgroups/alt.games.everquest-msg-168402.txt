I think the most abused name is Conservative. Buckley defined the
movement in America. I think it is a misnomer to say defend the Status
Quo, or we will still have large government, and a cradle to grave
promise.

I think the overriding element of Conservativism is that government
should be limited in scope, and that people can govern themselves.
Government exists for defense. That is, defense of the people from
others, foregn enemies, and in some cases natural disasters.
Everything else is susprect, and rightfully so.

That isn't the status quo in America. Our government from the 1930's
to the brink of the 1980's was out of control, and Reagan changed
that, not preserving that status quo!
