Yes it is . If you are not willing to pay the price I named I will not sell
to you . My prices are set by the following function . cost = true price of
materials( i dont include training costs but i probably should ) + estimated
price of time (500pp an hour at hgs ) + annoyance factor at having to deal
with you personally (0 to infinity ).
