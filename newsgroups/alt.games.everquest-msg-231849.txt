Oh lord...

Is that really the best you can come up with? Are you really reduced
to nitpicking how I phrased it?

Legal precedents are nothing more than opinions based on an
intrepretation of the law, Adam. And you've already made it clear that
you don't care about others opinions, only yours. 

Either you get it, or you don't. 

Doesn't matter much to me either way. I'll continue to charge what I
feel is a just and fair amount, and you can do as you will...
