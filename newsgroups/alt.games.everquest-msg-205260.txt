Agreed. The 263 damage ever 8 seconds on top of your DoTs is good. The
fights are short, and I normally take little enough damage that regen (the
level 52 one - 15 points a tick, then again, I'm not a troll) keeps me at
about the same health level, and sitting on dobbin get's my mana levels back
to starting point as well. I generally don't bother canni - ing. When I do,
I'm lazy enough to have a hotkey full of canni's with the correct delay in
it.

I've taken this through to the point where I've ditched a weapon and have a
'shield' in my primary hand when doing it (can't remember the name, some
sort of glowing orb).
