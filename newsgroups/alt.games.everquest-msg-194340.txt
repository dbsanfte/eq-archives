A side note... Evocation is a pain.  You don't really get a good Evoc spell
until your expel undead line.  If you don't fight a lot of undead, you won't
keep up.  Just cast Expel Undead on your little friend.  He won't mind,
heck, he'll still love you.  I think it must send electric tingles up and
down his spine which he seems to enjoy.
