...or not....

Okay I haven't been there doing kobolds for experience since before
Kunark, other than a rare trip or two with my ranger to solo bats (and
once long ago to camp efreeti), so maybe this is old news.

I noticed some new spawns there earlier (kobold guardian, advisor),
didn't think twice about it.

Well last night on Test I took my warrior there for some exp grinding,
which for the most part went more or less well. Except: after some
point every pull anyone did from anywhere in the kobold part of the
zone brought the entire KPC horde, no matter who or where this was
done, including those new named.

Wtf?

As far as I know it's still like this as we speak, because everyone
zoning out sure didn't solve the problem. If I had to take a guess,
I'd say one of the kobolds has become bugged somewhere, and is
chaining aggro into the KPC somehow. Anyone seen this there before? I
sure hope this isn't an example of the new aggro and pathing Sony was
working on. :-p
