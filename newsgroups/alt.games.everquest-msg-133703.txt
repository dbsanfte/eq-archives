The reason I suggested that example was that it was one of the first
things that sprang to mind. I agree it's not 'the same' situation, but I
do maintain it's a situation where a 'controversial' subject was
'needlessly' introduced, and was the first step in a drip-drip effect
that contributed. That in turn was a big part of moving away from
racism.

I think you were the one who introduced the '2 years old' level, and
have been pushing it ever since, despite beign told SS is officially
targetted at 3-7 yearolds, so maybe '5 years old' would be a fairer
average of the target audience. Sure, some 2 yearolds might be plonked
down in front of the au pair they call a TV, without regard for the
subject matter being a good year or two above them, but surely those are
the type of parents who wouldn't know/care what level of understanding
their child has whether 2 or 5 or 10 years old.

Because too many parents are too stupid to be left the responsibility.
Too many parents don't have the faintest clue about when their child is
'ready'. Too many parents wouldn't have the faintest clue how to broach
the subject even if they were told their child was ready. Most
frighteningly, too many parents think HiV is a gay curse, and don't even
want to contemplate their idea of THIER kids coming into contact with
anyone 'like that'.

If you are an active parent, who feels the subject matter isn't relevant
to your children, you are in a much better position to stop them
watching it, and explain in your own time, and by your own means. 

I realise this opens up accusations of a 'nanny state' teaching our
children what 'they' feel they should know, governed but a politically
motivated PC crowd. The flipside of that same coin is the 'mollycoddle'
brigade who think children should always be shielded from anything
beyond bright colors and rounded shapes.

Here's another question. At what age would you say an HiV+ character
*could* be introduced into a program. Late night discovery channel
documentaries? In ER maybe? How about Friends? Baywatch? Saved By The
Bell? Fresh Prince of Bel Air? At what age should children be allowed to
watch the News, or read broadsheet newspapers clearly a greater exposure
to the world's horrors.

OK, before you throw something like 'Should 5 yearolds watch hardcore
porn then?' at me, I KNOW it was a leading question. It was meant to
point out their is NEVER a point at which everyone would agree to full
disclosure, and you are moving the bar down to 2 yearolds to emphasise a
point, and strengthen your debate.

Nope, I don't. I don't see SS having a dream of stopping even a single
death from AIDS among their target audience, since their target audience
don't get it from 'conventional' sources generally (eg: sex and drugs)

I'm a cynic too, but I do honestly believe (given their track record)
that this pushes a message of tolerance among the kids it's directed at.
The only effect on the adult market is fostering debates (like this)
which can only be a good thing, right?
