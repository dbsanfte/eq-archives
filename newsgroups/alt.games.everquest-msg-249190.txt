That wasn't me (the second time thing). I left EQ, and have no urge to
go back. I did quit once before, and that lasted a good 9 months
before my real life friends said they were desperately in need of a
cleric (mine was 65), but now that they have all quit as well, I now
have no reason to keep playing. I never would have come back if they
hadn't begged me to in the first place.
