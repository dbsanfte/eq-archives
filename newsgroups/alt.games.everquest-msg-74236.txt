I can't possibly afford one, but I don't really know the stats on these
things.  My question is, when you're not riding it, is it like a spell to
summon it or does it take up a slot?  I'll stick with my selos/drum combo
anyway, but I was just curious.
Also, if you have a horse and lose a duel, can your horse be taken?

TIA if you can answer my ignorant, pointless questions!
Sean...
