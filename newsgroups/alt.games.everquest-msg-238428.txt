From the shadows, the mysterious NoSpam <Nospam@chiisai.demon.co.uk>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Some players had the same flaming bong.

Other fun bugs on test:

Getting off your horse/lizard either teleported you randomly in the
zone or 20ked you.

Using Dire Charm ported three people nearby (who were not in group
with either the druid or each other) to GFay. It also didn't dire
charm the dillo.

There was no way to zone out of PoV. There was also no way to zone
INTO PoF. And many teleport objects (like the chair in CoD) were
simply gone.

You could climb vertical walls like mobs do.

I really couldn't tell with just one account running, it was smooth
before and felt smooth now.

However having two EQ windows open sure showed a difference, and not a
positive one.
