I did make a bug report. I also had a REAL nice chat with my server
GM. Nice guy, he was helpful and we talked for a while. BTW, the
Bazaar is new to them as well. He had a petition and had to go. I have
a good idea that they DO look at the bugreports, and they also look
here.

Thanks for the confirmation, I figured it out. I do have a different
take though, you have to have a number of the items priced, but NOT
every one. I am going to go home, and edit all the prices in the INI
file. I am also going to remove all the traders sachels but one or two
for my sellable goods. That way instead of logging out for dinner, I
will just grab my sachels out of the bank, /trader and eat my Boliche.
