When picking between same ratio weapons.
Faster weapon in primary for more primary hand damage bonus.
After level 23 or is it 24 ? ( level minus 20 / 3 iirc )  it first starts
but doesn't really effect a lot until after level 30.
To max dual skill faster weapon offhand for more chances at skillups.
faster delay for more aggro less delay less aggro

Copelands is Wayyyyyy out of date an I am not sure if the data has any
validity.

Eqlogger has a benchmark option.
try benchmarking weapons one way. then the other.
