I remember for years when people asked for horses, they said it would be too
complicated, because they'd have to add new player models for riding on
horses, add the horse models themselves to the global file, and they'd have
all kinds of sync problems keeping the player on the horse.  It just
couldn't be done reasonably, they said.

Then I remember them saying they thought of a way to do it, and I distinctly
recall them saying what that was in an interview: when you summon a horse,
instead of summoning a horse, and switching to your riding model, and
sycning with the horse, instead they would just have one model that combines
player and horse--the horse would not be a separate NPC.  Essentially, from
a game engine point of view, a horse would simply be an illusion.

Based on all the horse problems, it is clear that they didn't do it this
way, but rather did it the first way, complete with all the problems.

I wonder why?  I thought that the second way was brilliant.
