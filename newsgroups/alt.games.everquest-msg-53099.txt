While I'm sure thats true, its not the best way to quickly raise
your offense.  I'm looking at best case scenario... do you really
purposefully get hit a -lot- while not attacking?  I tried doing
some porcupining in treeform, but it didn't go as well as
regular DS plus hitting em with a stick.

I thought of another factor... once those annoying buggers start to
run, you can't rely on your DS to kill em, bashing away with a
blunt object again raises your offense while your defense stays
static.  I'm thinking of memming root just to get em to stay on me
next time!
