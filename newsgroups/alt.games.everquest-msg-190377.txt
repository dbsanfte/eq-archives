You have Taunt as well, of course. With a % failure chance, but so does
the warrior.

In the example you give, I imagine you can chain stun the MOB which will
stop it from attacking (with some chance of failure of course) and boost
aggro in a hurry. Or you can root it and the wizard back off. The
Warrior... has Taunt. No tactical options at all. If Taunt fails, the
cleric spams heals on the wizard until it succeeds. Oh, but sorry, the
cleric is seven seconds into a CHeal...

Warriors need *some* other way of generating aggro. Perhaps changing Taunt
to be highest + N rather than highest +1 would do it, or have it generate
some amount of aggro on failure... but they need *something*.

Because one of them is good for abso-posi-lutely nothing else. And is
currently so underpowered outside of certain very specialised situations
that they've become a joke.

And the third is more important than the other two put together, until you
get to the very highest end raid MOBs.

You have a bunch of his abilities already. *You* can taunt. About the only
thing he has that you don't is /disc defensive... which is useful, I don't
deny, but just not all that useful outside of a raid.

Utterly false when solo, and in a group the cleric has other people to heal
as well... and will have more such healing to do with a warrior than with
a paladin or SK.

The smallest heal I use on a regular basis is Remedy, 450HP for 175 mana.
CHeal is 400 mana. So if I have to Remedy twice because the tank couldn't
hold aggro, I've used almost as much mana as a CHeal. If a tank has 50%
more HP but requires just one more Remedy per CHeal, they are tanking
worse than the tank who is doing a better job of holding aggro.

This is news? :-)

SOE seem to mainly aim for some amount of group balance without (1)
considering the availability of "key" spots that must be filled like tank
or healer; and (2) considering how grouping capabilities can be used for
solo use. It would be difficult to change necro capabilities without
breaking
them for groups, for example, so necros won't be nerfed any time soon.
The same is true for clerics - it would be difficult to make them better
soloers without making them overpowered for groups, so clerics will be
lousy soloers for the foreseeable future.

Sony tried to rebalance clerics to allow soloing a while back but nerfed
the new abilities later on because battle clerics became overpowered...
which was true, but not very helpful for the poor cleric trying to solo
after the nerfs went in.

We don't need warriors to be able to solo as well as druids or necros...
but if they could earn experience at just 50% of their grouping rate they
would be much nicer to play.

So now they can raid but not group...

Poor aggro control is a *direct cause* of inefficient mana usage, from
the viewpoint of a cleric. If the MA can hold aggro, I can CH all day and
start throwing in nukes, my pet... if the MA can't hold aggro, I wind up
blowing half my mana on microheals for the rest of the group.

Warriors currently have two ways of boosting aggro: weapon procs, and
taunt. The way taunt works (highest aggro + 1) makes it much less useful
for actually *holding* aggro, as distinct from grabbing it, and the
failure chance makes it less than entirely useful for grabbing aggro.

So basically they need some *other* way of generating aggro, because what
they currently have is just not good enough.

I agree 100% taunt is overpowered. To some degree I wish I hadn't made
that suggestion, as it's made an easy straw man for people to attack
without bringing up workable alternatives. To some people raiding is *not*
the point of the game, and a raid doesn't need more than a couple of
warriors anyway...

I disagree that warriors are still king in grouping situations. As a cleric,
I cannot think of a group situation where I would prefer a warrior to a
paladin or SK currently, due to the aggro management issues warriors have.
They are only somewhat preferable to a good ranger - the ranger is much
better at holding aggro, but takes much more damage; it balances out to
some extent. The reason I wouldn't usually take a ranger is because their
mitigation is so much worse that I very nearly have to chain-CHeal them.
But mana-wise the ranger may be preferable.

If a warrior has 50% more HP than another tank it doesn't matter because
the cleric is busy healing everybody else, and everybody else has to be
much more careful with *their* aggro, cutting down DPS...

While I can see your concern that powering up warriors makes them better
competition for paladins... frankly, they need it, and warriors are
currently ludicrously unbalanced. Useless solo, substantially less
useful in a group than a paladin or shadowknight, the only slot they
have left is raiding. Raiding is an important part of the game to some
people, but you need to *get* there first.
