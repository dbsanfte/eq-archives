Fresh Human Qeynos monks, absolutely no difference between them except
STA vs. STR.  zero equipment or buffs other than the guild tunic. 
fight yard trash to level 3, on dinging level 3:

CHAR      LVL    STA     STR     HP
Madrib      3     80     100     73
Madfoot     3    100      80     77

Assuming this continues, the STA monk will get 5.47 pct more hit
points all the time.  So at level 50, we could expect something like
1400 HP for the STR monk and 1475 for the STA monk.  It's hard to be
really precise at level 3 because of integer quantization.

Diagnosis:  if you want your monk optimized for pulling, you need HP
and resists, so create him w max STA.  if you want him optimized for
damage-dealing, create him w max STR.
