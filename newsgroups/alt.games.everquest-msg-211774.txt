Although my bard Banneth has only just hit 41, I've decided to make a
start on his epic and am ready for my first kill (Maligar).  I have a
few friends with level 65 chars that are going to assist me, so the
only thing we envisage perhaps being a problem is getting to Trak and
the Undead Bard.  We'll cross that bridge when we eventually get to it
- assembling a small raid force will not be a problem, and we're
hoping that all the new zones (including LDoN) will have drawn a lot
of folks away from Sebilis.

However, I've read in a thread on EQDiva that some turn-ins require
the PC to be level 51. Not necessarily a problem, but obviously it
would be nice to know which ones!  Is it true, and if so, does anyone
know what the restrictions are?

Thought I'd ask here first rather than on EQDiva, because I much
prefer "proper news" to forums.  :)

Incidentally, my last post here was a couple of months back about my
screen suddenly being a lot darker than it used to.  It turned out to
be because I was playing in windowed mode, which looks grainier and
certainly much darker than full screen
.
