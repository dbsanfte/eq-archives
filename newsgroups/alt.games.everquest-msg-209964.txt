Good idea... I have had those for a while now, though. :(

I love clickies... I'll take an effect over awesome stats any day of the 
week. Unfortunately, all the clickies that mean anything to a 65 Druid 
are way beyond that kind of money... At least the ones I know of. My 
best clicky (better than my Epic, in terms of usefulness) is a Goblin 
Gazughi Ring. Insta-invisibility to Animals is a godsend when it comes 
to charm-kiting.
