Since it's a proc, the frequency that it will proc is dependant on
your DEX.  I rarely use this unless I have a dex buff available.  The
difference is significant.  I'm anxiously awaiting a Boon of the Garou
buff to experience it in all it's glory.  Unfortunately, I have a high
delay weapon (49), so the chances of it going off are few and far
between.
