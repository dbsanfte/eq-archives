With my own eyes I saw the AC spawn twice within 45 minutes in South
Ro.   I know the time well because I was camping him and someone else
got to him before I did and all I could do was watch them take him
down.  I was really bummed about that, but decided to go on camping
him anyway.  He spawned again less than 45 minutes later, and I killed
him for my Jboots.
