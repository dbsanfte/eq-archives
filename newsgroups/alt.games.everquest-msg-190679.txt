Certainly the Cleric/Pally combo isn't "optimal"
The cleric basically negates a large portion of
why you give up a warriors damage output - and
that's the healing/buffing spells.  By the time
the cleric can group with your pally, his buffs
and heals will already be better.

Given the low DPS of a pally, I think I'd choose
one of the other priest classes, but that's just
me.  I personally also would prefer the shaman.

He's a better match for your pally, and he's as
good - if not better - for watching over your
minor characters.  In the low levels XP goes so
quick, and rezzes give back so little, that
that's not a good enough reason to have a cleric
over a shaman.

Consider - Shaman slows dramatically reduce the
damage you take.  SoW can increase your survivability
out doors, and makes pulling much easier.  At 24
they get Canni, so they regen mana quickly, and
regens (to help offset canni, and mana efficient
hp recovery for the pally).  29 gives haste.  34
he gets a wolf pet.  The wolf and haste between them
will up you dps considerably, something the cleric
can't do for you.

As far as PL'ing with the Pally, well they aren't
exactly designed for it - however, since you only
have to get the PL'ee to 17th level to group with
your pally, you can probably do it.

Up to at least level 10 just have the pally use
Center to buff and heal the lower level character.

One of the main techniques for PL'ing is for
the higher level character to almost kill a mob,
then erase the mobs memory of the damage he's done
so the PL'ee can get the xp.  Monks and SK's beat
down the mob and feign to clear their damage, Bards
and enchanters use charm to clear the damage,
clerics use Atone, Mages (and I assume BL's and
necro's can do this) let their pets beat down
the mob then reclaim/pet get lost the pet to clear
the damage.  If you can't do any of these things,
then the only choice you have is to zone to clear
the damage.

To do this, you'd pull a mob to the zone line with
the pally, beat it to a sliver of health, zone the
pally, swap over to the PL'ee and finish the mob.

As fast as the early levels go, and considering you
only have to get to 17, you may want to just play the
2nd account character straight up so you learn the
character.

When I first created my 2nd account cleric, one of
my computers was out - so I played him pretty much
straight up to level 12, seems to me it was less
than a day played.

Hope this helps a bit :)
