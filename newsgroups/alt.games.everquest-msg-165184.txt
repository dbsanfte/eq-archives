Honestly, it's worth so little that you should take care to sacrifice
<nothing> for AGI once it's 75 or higher.  My retired Half Elf Warrior
has a base AGI of 120 (maxed it on creation as an experiment).  He
<seemed> to have "miraculous survival" results while soloing more often
than other chars I've played, but that could be just my perception, at
very low level (under 15) the benefit was mild but obvious.  The amount
of data I'd have to parse to get a handle on the real benefit of raised
AGI is just not worth it, given that I've noticed very little if any
advantage even when looking for it.

More likely that the mobs in question have unusually high AC for
their level, possibly magnified if you have parsed only when it
went really badly and you wanted to know just how bad it was.

A long time ago somebody posted a rule of thumb suggesting a rough
equivalency of 10hp per 1ac for tanking.  I've found that to be
reasonable as a rough guide for comparing gear, and the Orc Fangs
give 15hp vs. 1ac when compared to the Cougar Claws.

When you are fighting most casters the SSB is better than the DWH.
When you go to Kedge to get your Dusty Fingerbone you'll find that
MR matters a lot, and other places (like Lower Guk) MR is valuable
too.  Excepting cases where your level is too low to give you much
chance of resisting anything, MR is great:  Fear, Snare, Root, Mez,
Charm, many nukes, and some DoTs are checked vs. MR.  The biggest
deals are Fear/Mez/Charm which take you out of the fight (or worse
in the case of Charm) and Root, which you get multiple chances to
break so a high MR helps even if you fail the initial resist.

And watch for the Weighty Polearm like John Muir suggested.  I haven't
seen it under 500pp on my server (he said 250, he must play on one of
those servers that had 10kpp Windblades too), but even at 500 it would
be a nice upgrade from your Arbitor's, and be far cheaper than an
Argent Protector or any similar damage output upgrade.  You're using
your DWH now, so you have to be 45+, and with 90% or better of the
dmg/bonuses the WP will be very good for you.
