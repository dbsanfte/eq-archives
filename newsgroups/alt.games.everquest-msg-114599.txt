Ah yes! Perhaps if you role played a happy little Halfling Druid you would
celebrate more.

My happy little halfling grew tired of losing a level because he could
"DING!" faster by regaining a level then getting all that experience
necessary to gain a level. He then decided that "DING!" being such a happy
type thing to share with everyone in a zone that he shouldn't be bound by
societies norms.

Now he just shouts "DING! Free SoWs for everyone!" a few dozen times a
night. Just about every time he enters a zone he shouts "DING!"

Sometimes when he is sad or less happy then normal he may say "DING 7!"
Other times when he is really happy he may say "DING 55!" Fifty-five seems
to be so much more joyous of a level then 7.

He also burst out in song every time someone else in a zone
"DING"s
with
"DONG! The witch is dead. The wicked witch. The witch is dead."
I don't see why we don't have Halfling Bards myself.

Of course my necro just asks whoever shouts DING "u wanna dual smartazz?"
