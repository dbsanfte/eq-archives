If the shoe fits, wear it. If not, I haven't ignored your points:

1. Don't make the metal bits - buy them from others. Would if I could.
There aren't too many people selling them.

2. If I'm frustrated, quit. Sorry, my desire to get better is stronger
than that.

3. Don't throw a hissy fit until I have experienced a greater loss in
my combine failures. Like I said, I have just as much right to "throw
a hissy fit" as anyone else, regardless of the magnitude of my loss.

Those are the ones I can remember off the top of my head without going
back through your posts. Let me know if I missed any, and I'll repeat
my responses to those as well.
