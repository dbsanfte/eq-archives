Ah, well, the free version of Tiny Personal Firewall is just that - a
firewall. It doesnt to anything more than prevent unauthorized internet
access. No popup blockers, adware stoppers, virus checkers, random cookie
blockers or anything else. Although, it looks like the newer versions of TPF
have those things. Theyre not free though, except for a 30 day trial.
