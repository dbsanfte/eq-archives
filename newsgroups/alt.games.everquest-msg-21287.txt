Ah, then your statement that a "devistateing [sic] case" could be made
is nothing more than pure speculation, and dare I guess, one without

The account isn't copyrighted material. It's a service, just like any
other online service you receive. Therefore, it's not subject to
copyright laws.

Irrelevant, as it has nothing to do with either copyright or with a
subscription service.
