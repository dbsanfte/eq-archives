There was once a very knowledgeable person in this group that said you
waste you time getting a cleric when you want to exp grind.  Sang I
think his name was.  Basically just get a shaman that can slow and
haste and you never really need a cleric.  The heal power of the
shaman was all you needed for exp grinding.

If the mob was not slowable then you needed a cleric.

Does anyone remember that argument?
