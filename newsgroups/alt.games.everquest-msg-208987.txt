I would say if the cleric is in the habit of nuking when another healer is
not present or covering heals, something in wrong. The primary goal is to
keep everyone alive and it more and more important that a cleric learn just
that. Healing in a timely manner without getting aggro is an art form! If
the tanks keep pulling when cleric is clearly out of mana, then find a tank
that understands the role of main tank. It might be fun to fly by the seat
of your pants on heals and mana, recovering bodies and waiting for rez
effects are a real pain. XP loss at your level on an occasional death is
minimal and can be quickly returned after a small series of kills. Best of
luck
