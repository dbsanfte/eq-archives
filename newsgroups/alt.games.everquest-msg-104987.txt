My little brother is dyslexic.  He had to learn to read and write from
specialists, but he's completely normal and his writing is fine.  I have
another friend who is dyslexic that is a programmer...I'll never quite
understand how he does it, but he gets paid well, so he must know his stuff.
On a side-note, my little brother has a bumper sticker on his car that says
"DYSLEXICS UNTIE!!"  too funny.

Sean...
