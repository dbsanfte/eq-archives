Opened up my tradskill container with my Shaman and noticed there was a search 
recipes button.  I heard that it would bring up all combines that you could 
do.  When I hit it I only got about 4 or 5 recipes none of which I knew what 
they were.  In the past I have only made SOW potions successfully but I know 
my skill is high enough to make others.  I then notice that if I made a sow 
potion it would then show up in the list.  I thought it should of shown up 
already cause I was high enough in skill to make it trivial.  Am I incorrect 
on this or is it still buggy?
