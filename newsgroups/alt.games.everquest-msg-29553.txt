Rubbish! If that were the case a human would 'never' triumph over a machine,
and if there we no room for creativity there would'nt be so many different
playing styles. Bobby Fisher used to use a great yet risky strategy where he
would gamble on his opponents greed to achieve a position where a fast mate
could be forced. There is no 'logic' in this strategy as the opponents greed
factor can't be correctly assessed. To say the game of kings requires no
creativity or strategy beggars belief. There are three phases in any game.
opening, middle and end game. Volumes upon volumes have been written about the
different strategy's for each.
Logic tells you : A bishop and a Knight are of equal value but when playing
someone who specialises with two bishops, common sense tells you "His bishops,
due to his particular playing style and strategy, are worth a little more than
his knights"
