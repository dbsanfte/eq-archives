Do you have a source for this? I mean do you *need* 5-6 people... or can 
you run with 1, 2, 3, or 4? I'd have to have my 3 best friends on and 
then **have** to dick around looking for another body just to play...

Raids leave me in the cold. I'm really looking forward to instanced 
content to allow them to drop 'good' items to non-raiders instead of 
making anything worth getting only drop if you're part of guild who sets 
EQ above RL...too bad i have a feeling all the good items are still 
going to go to the raiders. It bugs me that EQ caters to the career 
EQers so much... they pay the same 12.95 as everyone else... why are 
they first class citizens... if SOE just said ... fine you 'won' the 
game... maybe you should play something else now... and focussed on the 
other 380,000 players needs eq would be a better game...

/Agrees. With instanced content... solo play could be rewarded. Although 
I really don't object to 2-3 person groups. The good EQ dungeons have 
almost never been soloable, at least if you want to crawl them... most 
have a couple mobs you can camp solo I guess.
