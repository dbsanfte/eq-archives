This is sniped from the text of the patch message:

"** Experience System Change - Grouping **

We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in EverQuest.  These improvements are
aimed at positively reinforcing the act of grouping.  After all, this is a Massively Multiplayer
game.

Prior to this update groups gained a 2% to 20% experience bonus for having two to six members.

As of today this bonus has increased to range from 20% to 80% for having two to five members.  When
a group adds a sixth member, the 80% bonus remains, but the experience gained is only divided by 5
before being distributed.  The sixth group member no longer causes the experience gain to be divided
by 6."

So if I read this right, xp is now awarded to full groups on the basis of 6/5. If this is true, then
they are really playing with numbers. How can you award each member of the group with 6/5 share?
Or, does the sixth member not get xp? either way this really is going to screw with the awarding of
xp. Personally I would have left it with each recieving 1/6 of the xp, but increased the percent
that was divided among the players, by dividing the total xp of the mob by 6 with a bonus of 10%. 
Seems more fair to me, but I'm only a History major in college and know nothing of higher math.
