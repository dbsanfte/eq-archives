Well, I only read about 2 different ones of "all the GM events". One I saw
myself in Dreadlands on the Vazaelle server. Some huge Stonegazer, some
Drolvarg Skeleton and a huge dragon were creating havoc there. You could
tell it were GM's because at one time the dragon simply stood there for a
while with my pet beating on it and me casting spells (never got even one
through, not even malosi). It was like the guy was gone for a bathroom brake
or something. Right after that he flung a lot of AoE spells so that I had to
zone into KC before getting killed.

I logged soon after so I didn't see it go down. A friend of mine was in a
group that beat it. They got a CoF and some other, "minor", items.

The other event was aparently in the EC tunnel, but I don't know what
server. Some hordes of undead (ghouls mainly) and all the newbie guards of
EC were pestering the players there. Including Sgt Slate. The persons of the
report I read had Slate down pretty fast. The ghouls were trivial.
