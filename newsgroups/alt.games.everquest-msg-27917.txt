I'm not a big fan of ATI products personally.  As a matter of fact, I'm
sitting at an AMD box here at work with an ATI card - and it plays EQ for
shit.

They're full of shit about WinME, IMNSHO.  I can personally testify to the
Win2kpro issues, but not on *my* system under WinME.  EQ performs on my
system, and specifically the SBLive! card - *exactly* as it does under a
Win98SE install on the same box.  I can't say the same for Win2k.  As a
matter of fact I'm a bit worried right now as my latest preview copy of
Windows XP RC2 runs EQ for shit too.  Especially annoying at this point is
the fact that I have to use the stock MS mouse drivers because Logitech
hasn't specifically added XP support yet (duh) for my Mouseman Wheel
optimouse.  Under XP (or 2k without the Logitech drivers installed - using
stock MS support) you almost have to keep picking up the mouse and putting
it back to the left of your pad after almost rolling it off your pad trying
to get the cursor to move a little tiny bit.  UGH

ymmv
