I had that same problem until I switched to the .jpg mode; my .bmp's
wouldn't open in anything after one of those patches (don't recall now which
one, but the one that set up the separate folders, moved the flowing thought
to mana regen, etc.). Still can't open the .bmp's made during those couple
of days, but the .jpg's once I set the .ini file to use that format open
just fine. :)

Hope that helps. I'd give the exact line to put into the ini to change them
to .jpg, but at work right now and can't access it. However, I will say that
the .jpg line didn't work at all either until I put it towards the top of
the file instead of at the end.
