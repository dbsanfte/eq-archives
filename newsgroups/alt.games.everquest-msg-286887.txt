Why?  What does this add to the game?  Are there choices that will be 
available to people via this window that weren't by the original claim 
system?

This is the key to open all doors in Howling Stones (aka Charassis)?  I 
can't even look now to see if it had an aug slot, since I destroyed it 
once it was on my keyring.  Fun to see oldschool junk getting some love 
though.

Tutorial sword right?  Yeah, SK did have a complaint there, nice little 
attention to detail fix.

I don't know what this means.  There are DODH-only skills?  Combine is 
at DODH now, and I don't remember seeing any new skills.

You know, I'm keyed for VP 2.0 and I've only been in there running 
around to explore.  I was planning on doing some of the quests, but they 
took so long to do that I've since gotten better items for those slots. 
  I should read up on the drops and see if its time to get some people 
and go in there hunting... I love clickies!

What?  Why?  As if LDoN armor wasn't outdated enough... the only reason 
I'm still wearing a piece of it is for my slot 3 dodge skill augment!

Thats going to make for some sad casters, since most agree a no helm 
look is the way to go

OK Good news for spider farmers I guess, but bad news for pelt farmers. 
  Why change this sort of behavior in a zone few people visit anymore 
anyway?

This will be a nice little tweak, its annoying to hand pet gear to pets 
who have just been summoned.

You hope.

Um, what did they do before?  I can only think of a few things this 
could be changing:  1) AE procs will now no longer be AE>.. goodbye 
Shakerpage.  Or 2) Weapon procs no longer affect the wielder, change to 
nullify magic sword and rodrick's dagger and anything else that casts on 
the weilder.  Or 3) there was some way to get a weapon's proc to hit 
more than one target even though it should have been single target and I 
just never heard of it
