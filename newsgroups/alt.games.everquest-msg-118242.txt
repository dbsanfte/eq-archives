Hi,

I was wondering if anyone had tried and succeded in re-selling their trusty
steed. I have been told by several people that after a not-so-recent patch,
horses could now be sold back to a vendor in the bazaar. The bridles are no
drop, so selling them is rather tricky. When i try so sell, the merchants
give me a price, but when i click the sell button they say they are not
interested - the usual when trying to sell no drop items.

I asked in OOC and was told that if I hand the bridle back to the merchant I
bought it from, he will hand me a pouch which can then be sold - kind of
like a quest. This seems plausable but I dont want to try it without
confirmation - afterall I don't know the person who answered my OOC plea for
help and they may have been having a little joke at my expense.

I'd be gratefull if anyone could confirm that this is how horses are sold
back, or if there is some other merchant who buys horses.

Thanks in advance.

Guapo
