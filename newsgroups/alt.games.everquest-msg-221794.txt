There's a couple of dungeons where calling a camp from the zone line
is standard practice (at least on my server). Do a camp check and then
call 'heading to Chef' in sebilis for example if nobody calls it. Main
reason is  that it takes a while to clear the mobs to get there so
hopefully you don't waste 20 minutes clearing trash mobs just to find
it camped. It also gives anyone who might have missed the first camp
check another chance to reply. And finally, it hopefully means nobody
else is gonna try and leapfrog you on the way as you're clearing to
the camp if you answer a camp check with 'clearing to camp-x'. Doesn't
always work, some people are just jerks but overall the people that do
dungeons tends to be a relatively polite bunch. It's much easier to
ask a group to rez your cleric if you buffed them on the way past than
if you got into a pissing contest over who had what camp.

My favorite was a drood (as opposed to a druid) that claimed to have
been camping a mob for 2 days. Feydedar in TD; a friend of mine logs
in her alt to see if the trigger is up, it is, nobody's there so we
gather a group to take it down. About 30 minutes later we show up with
10 people (overwhelming force given that half of them were 65 from a
relatively uber guild) and there's now a druid there with a cleric
(bot?). Since I was organizing the trip, I did the talking to this
druid and the conversation went something like this ...

(I missed a few initial comments since our druid was there about a
minute before me, but she's way too nice a person to start anything)

Drood: Leave now or I'll kill the trigger mob so nobody can do the
turnin. 
(seriously, that was his first comment when I walked up)

/report Drood
/petition Drood
Me: You're an idiot for publicly threatening a bannable offense,
you've just been petitioned. You also just pretty much blew any chance
you had of getting this worked out. 

Drood: I'll turn in the trigger and spawn the dragon. 

Me: I can't stop you so feel free, we'll stand back and watch.

Drood shouts: I've been here for 2 days and this group is threatening
to KS my epic mob. 

Me: You're a liar, you weren't here 30 minutes ago. 

Drood shouts: Well, I've been camped here for the last 2 days, logging
in occasionally to check on the trigger. 

/tell our druid: do the turnin, I'm afraid this idiot will rub off on
me if I keep talking to him.
