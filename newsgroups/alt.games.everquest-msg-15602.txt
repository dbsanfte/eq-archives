I play on the Terris -Thule Server and as far as my tailoring exploits have
gone and seen i sell skins as follows:

HQ Wolf-    1-2 pp
MQ Wolf-    5gp
LQ Wolf-     Give away

HQ Cat-    5pp
MQ Cat-    1-2 pp
LQ Cat-    Give away

HQ Bear-    30pp (strict)
MQ Bear-    10pp (strict)
LQ Bear-    Give away

All Ruined Pelts and skins usually sell for about 1gp each as beginning
tailors make patchwork which sells well around qeynos and misty thicket.
