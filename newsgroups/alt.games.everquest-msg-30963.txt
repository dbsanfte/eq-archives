Idiot number 3 isnt so much of an idiot - everfrost is a newbie area
at one side and a gradually increasing zone of difficulty - up to the
perma entry that is giant killing teritory.

Getting a port there may sound odd but if he ported to NK and bound in
Halas CR isnt a problem - maybe he had friends who wanted to hunt in
Blackburrow or he knew that was a place to hunt.
