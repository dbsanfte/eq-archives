Hmmnmm...just thought it a bit odd.... a RL friend of mine and I were on at
the same time the past couple of nights trying to adventure together.  We
would both go LD at the exact same times, even when no one else in the zone
would.  We both went simultaniously LD several times over the past couple of
nights.

Since we both have the same ISP (same company, but different towns), it made
me start thinking that the vast majority of my LD's are my ISP's fault, not
Sony's.
