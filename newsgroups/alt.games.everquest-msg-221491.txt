I would at least offer the people wanting specific drops the chance to 
buy them prior to selling the items to a merchant.  Some of the 
tradeskill drops are quite hard to come by, as well as research 
materials.  The gems is another story, they can mostly be purchased most 
anywhere, but still, if the person wants them enough to pay their selling 
price, why not?  Often, now, selling items to a merchant means they 
vanish, as the merchant already has a full inventory of items, this means 
that there is not even the option of paying the inflated vendor price to 
buy them back.
