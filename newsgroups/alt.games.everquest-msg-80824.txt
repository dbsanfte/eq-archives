Wow - thanks everyone for the great advice!

Memmed it last night and gave it a try.  Had a small group in GD.  Myself (39
Cleric) a 42 shaman, 41 wizard and 40 Warrior.  Didn't heal the warrior through
a few fights (no fear - I had let them know that we were gonna 'play' with
CHeal...) and then he brought back 2 on a pull.  Waited... waited... waited... 
Hit the hotkey (/gsay Complete Heal incoming for %T in TEN seconds and then the
cast).  Tank says, "Holy poop - 1700 hit points healed!"  Later on I had to hit
it when we just arrived with a pull.  Bad move, he didn't have enough aggro and
I got slapped around a bit before he could pull it off of me.  Should've tossed
a few Valors/Greater Heals instead.  ;-)

We had fun.  I think I'm gonna love this one...

Oh - as to the, "you're healed good enough, gonna worry about the guy who is
supposed to have aggro" comments:  Yep, I do that a lot - I'll toss a quick
valor (200'ish hp heal) at the robed wonders from time to time but I sure don't
get caught up in keeping them at full health during a scrum. That can wait until
AFTER the battle.  Helps 'em learn aggro management too!
Good enough works for me - and usually them.  Mostly grouping with guildies, so
we all know the score.
