My primary EQ computer is a 500MhZ Celeron with 512MB,
and it's really quite playable too.

The only thing I really have to watch out for is attending
raids with 30+ people.  If my computer tries to render
30+ Luclin-models all in the same view, suddenly it chokes
and gives me framerates on the order of one per second.
On one raid I was the puller and simply could *not* function
that way; as I ran back to the group (which put them all
in front of me and in my field of view, of course), the
sudden framerate drop would reduce my run to a crawl, which
is *not* good when a Protector of Zek is on your tail.

I finished that raid by running *backwards* to the
crowd each time I pulled, which actually worked 
surprisingly well. :-)

The next raid (same people, same spot), I made a point 
of turning off *all* Luclin models, and then pulling ]
the normal way (face-forward) was no problem.

Nor do I have much of a problem with up to about two dozen
Luclin models in view at once (e.g., in the EC tunnel).
It's only when it hits about 30+ that I hit some sort
of critical threshhold and things slow to a crawl.
