	The problem with the tradeskill game is that it bottoms out very, very
quickly.  Even if you haven't made every item in the game, after a short while
it becomes clear that you've seen everything there is to see.  The result is
that even the hardcore enthusiasts burn out very quickly.

	Keep in mind, I funded all my equipment purchases in EQ up to level 50 by
selling tradeskill products (bows) -- and purchasing was how I got everything
that wasn't NoDrop.  This was back when you had to go stand in your server's
trading zone (EC on E'ci) and /auction your stuff, too.  The Bazaar has been a
huge *negative* feature for this aspect of the game.  It removed all of the
human interaction, and it removed the cost of being a merchant.  In the old
days, if you wanted to sell stuff you had to take time out of levelling and go
sell.  Now, every Tom, Dick and Mary who can leave their computer on is
selling, and the crushing power of the deflationary economy is felt in full
force.  By automating the process even further, SWG will be *even less
interesting*.
