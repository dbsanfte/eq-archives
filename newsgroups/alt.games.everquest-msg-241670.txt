Yipe! I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's exactly wrong.  You can make poison 
vials from any LQ/MQ/HQ Bear/Wolf/Cat pelt, -except- LQ cat, because they 
were added with stonebrunt mountains and they never added a poison vial 
recipe for them, to my knowledge.  They may have fixed that, but 
eqtraders still doesn't list a LQ cat recipe, and in any case, you 
certainly don't need to skinning knife the pelts to make vials, as the 
MQ/HQ versions work just fine...  but keep in mind that all of those sell 
fairly well in bazaar, and that may prove to be a much more profitable use 
for them.

MQ/HQ B/W/C pelts are much better used for skilling up tailoring, and LQ 
B/W/C is much better used for making leather paddings for smithing.  HQ 
Bear pelts are especially valuable, and ideally would be made into 
backpacks, and then backpack tokens, and sold for 80-100pp in bazaar.  

The reason I say those are better for those skills is that there are many 
other pelts that you can make poison vials out of, that have no other 
use.  Because of this, you're likely to find -tons- of them on merchants.  
I usually use zombie skins and black wolf skins, but you can also use 
white wolf skin, mist wolf pelt, MQ Lion skin, puma skin, polar bear skin, 
and tiger skin.  You could use HQ lion skin, but that one's very rare 
and can be sold for 100pp or so to someone making a fleeting quiver.  All 
of these skins turn up by the truckload on vendors in areas where the mobs 
are found, for ~2gp each, and nobody wants them for anything else, so make 
vials of them to your heart's content!  Most of them are stackable, with 
the exception of tiger skin and polar bear skin (and maybe mist wolf 
pelt? not sure).  Generally, one tour through east commonlands vendors 
will yield a stack or two of these pelts.  Neriak was good for black wolf 
and zombie skin, Kelethin has a fair amount of black wolf, and Gunthak 
sometimes has a lot of zombie skin.  I would keep the Bear/Wolf/Cat pelts, 
I've had very good luck selling them in bazaar for 5-10pp each.

Since you're touring vendors, make sure you also keep an eye out for other 
good bazaar sellers:  spider silk, spiderling silk, shadeling silk, shade 
silk, crystalline silk, HQ/MQ/LQ rockhopper hide, small pieces of velium, 
small pieces of acrylia, chunk of condensed shadow/ice/flame, and coiled 
springs.  All of these are stackable, and can be marked up about 1000% or 
more over what you paid the NPC vendor for them and sell within a day or 
three.  Sometimes, you may even find an incredible score, like the highly 
polished gem I found the other day in the Neriak necro guild... merchant 
wants 16pp, sells in bazaar for 8-9K.  Or a haze panther eye, that would 
be good.  Or occasionally, I've found a merchant where someone dumped a 
ton of level 55-60 spells... some of those spells sell in bazaar for 
300-2K, and the merchant wants 10-30 pp each for them.  They sell slower, 
but for profit like that, it is -so- worth it.  Just make sure you 
check the prices on those in the bazaar, though, some of them are 
dirt common and sell for barely more than the vendor cost, if ya 
get lucky. Velious tailoring pelts (especially arctic wyvern hide) also 
moved pretty quickly, purchased at 25pp, sold at 100.  I found 84 pelts on 
one vendor (in Neriak again, heh!) and cleared 6K profit on that in less 
than 24 hours.  Hellooo new drogmor. :)

}Poison vials were much less frustrating

}stack. 

I very much agree... there are rumors that the unfired linings stack now, 
but having to run to JP for patterns was annoying anyway.  Not to 
mention the unfired bowls not stacking, bleh. :)
