I wouldn't go so far as to say 'pursuit of socialism'. More simply that 
there is a legitimate gripe that oil companies are more interested in 
selling oil than developing alternative engery sources... to the point 
of acting -against- developing alternative engergy sources.

Its definately an attack on one of the failures of 'capitalism', but the 
pursuit of socialist alternatives isn't actually required. Its possible 
to observe that capitalism has failure without propping a socialist agenda.

I wouldn't say that either.

Some environmentalists are 'preservationists' and just want to see the 
worlds ecosystems preserved exactly as they are today (or better yet 
regressed to as they were 500 years ago), but not all of them are so rabid.

Its possible to see hydro as environmentally sound from the perspective 
of it being a solution that once implemented, allows for sustainable 
ecosystems to co-exist with it...the area around a functioning hydro dam 
can be restored to park like ecology. Unlike the the virtually lifeless 
deserts that arise from acres of solar or wind collectors, or the 
environmental destruction resulting from burning wood and coal at large 
scales.
