 One can only hope.

 What do I care if you kill soloing? It's called the Planes of Power
not the Planes of Gimp. Did people actually make it to Plane of Valor by
quad-kiting through the trials? I hardly doubt it.

 And this is bad why? Why do you feel people should be blessed with the
ability to solo level 62 mobs. Think about that. Level 62. If you
honestly believe level 62 mobs should not summon then you're playing the
wrong expansion.

"Monks are overpowered, lets nerf them!"

 Cry me a fucking river. 

 I am not calling for nerfs against a group of people. I just think mobs
of a certain level should have certain capabilities. That nerfs players
in exactly 0 ways.

 I did also mention 55 since 51 may be a bit low. Level 62 mobs are not,
to me, considered "trash exp mobs", sorry.

 More than likely. I am a melee. I'm a recently nerfed Monk and level
61+ so that means my soloing days are over. If mine are, guess what... I
don't give a hoot about anyone else being able to solo, either. If
wizards and druids can't solo, guess what... Get a group like everyone
else has to do.

 Welcome to PoP! Please enjoy your stay.
