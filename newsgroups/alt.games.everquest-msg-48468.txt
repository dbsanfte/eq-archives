He's not "always" camped anymore, at least not on my server.  My druid
popped in at random times looking for him and only saw someone actively
camping him once (with see invis and tracking verifying his uncamped
status).   It was only a matter of time til i dropped in and he was on track
and noone else was there. Got the book about a month ago.  It can happen,
just don't count on it happening fast.
