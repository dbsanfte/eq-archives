Many moons ago I was a guide, and back in the old days, you used to have 
a window pop up with the name of the char that someone was trying to 
make, and you could accept or decline that name.  I know a few guides 
when busy will keep pressing decline or No to whatever name pops up 
without reading them.  You used to be able to catch idiots who were 
trying to make dumb names that way, you'd allow one through then go and 
see them when they spawned in the game the first time.

I have no idea what its like now, but thats what it was about 2 years ago.

Naming policy is mostly at the discretion of the guide online, but also 
they should know the naming policy as it posted on their own guide board.
