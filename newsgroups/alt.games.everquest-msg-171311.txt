This includes the sword I mentioned, which is crap.  The rest, as I
recall, is also crap.  Rangers, unless you want to count on Verant to
change things by the time you hit 40 or so, *do not* choose Karana.

It's time for Karana to pull through for the Ranger class but Im not
holding my breath.

I just dont understand what the point of offering a different option
is, if all it does is provide a serious limitation.  (I used some
stupid character creation guide that told me deities dont matter to
rangers--Looking back, it must have been written by someone that had
hit level 30 and thought they knew everything.)  It's like letting
clerics worship one of two deities.  Then letting half (well ok, the
10 percent who didnt research well before they started their
character) find out that when they hit level 44, (or whatever it is
for Clerics), they dont get celestial healing.  Or maybe that their
complete heals will cost twice as much mana.  There is no advantage to
your choice, you just get screwed.

What is the point?
