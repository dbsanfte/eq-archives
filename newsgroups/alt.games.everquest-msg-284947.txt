There has always been an exemption for mail order sales.  I think that as 
long as the customer is not in the state that the company is then the sale 
is exempt from sales tax. Internet sales cannot be any different.  If a law 
is passed saying that internet sales are taxable but leave the mail order 
exemption then companies just have to ask their customers to print a coupon 
and mail it in.  Then its mail order.
