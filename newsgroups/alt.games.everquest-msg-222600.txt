This is my understanding about this spawn...

As a Druid, I need his remains, NOT him...  Ok, so I go to KC, check to see if
he is up, if he is, bring a bunch of my friends to kill him.  

Two DAYS later (real time?) his remains spawn so I have to be there, camping
that spot to kill them so that I can get the stone...

Then, 72 hours later VS will spawn again in all his bad self?  LOL

How ridiculous...  Anyone on Torv camping KC that can send me a tell when his
remains are up?  hehe  I honestly don't know how often this guy is killed or
any of that...

Any advice is much appreciated!
