I surrender.  My conclusion is that you are either a troll or are
mentally deficient; some people are simply unable to discuss
anything, despite a convincing illusion of sanity.

For the record, of COURSE I manipulated everything to get to
where I was playing like you, I said as much, "group B" played
like you except for one difference, the one we were discussing. 
Thats not something tricky I'm doing that you can call me on, its
a tool to allow discussion without distractions.

Make that, the one I was discussing and you were evading.

I can't think of any more ways to say it, I'm past bored, past
frustrated, past amused, and at the point of regret; I'm sorry I
ever went this far trying to get you to debate a simple concept.

Worst part is, its vaguely possible you are right, that you have
some superior tactic that I could adopt.  But I'll never know,
because you won't say what it is, all you do is try and wriggle
out of any possible confrontation.

On the bright side, you make my wife look like a sane and
rational human being by comparison.  And Rush Limbaugh.  But not
GW Bush, who doesn't have your gloss of seeming rationality to
hide his inanity behind.
