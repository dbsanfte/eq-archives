With meelee folks regularly swinging blades for over 1000 HP and much
more using abilities   where does that leave so called powerfully
nuking wizards and mages??

Manaburn aside?  Are they even needed any more at the high level game?
This is not to put them down.  I am a lvl 38 wizard but this thread
just put me into a depressed  identity crisis.
