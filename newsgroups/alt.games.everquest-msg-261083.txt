And you believed that?

Far too many ways to interpret their "data" to say something like that and
be completely wrong.  For instance, I have three level 65 (wait...  two
level 66 and a 65, and since no raid tonight, maybe two 67) characters, but
I have quite a number more between 30 and 50.  Counted "incorrectly", I add
to the "majority of players playing a character between 30 and 50", which
would be far from correct and/or a gross misrepresentation.
