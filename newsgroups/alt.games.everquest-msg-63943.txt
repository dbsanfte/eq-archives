And your glasses won't become less useful if you fix them with tape, or
your car less useful if you paint it shit-brown. Some of us give some
weight to aesthetics, and some don't, and that's all there is to it. I
don't think it's really your place to question what other players derive
their enjoyment from. 

Me, for one, I choose my own equipment for fashion as much as I do for
usefulness, and so far it hasn't hurt any of my characters. It may take
me one or two more days /played to reach the dizzy heights of 60, but
I'll get there in style.
