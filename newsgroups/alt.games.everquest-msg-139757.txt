Between work and home I spend a good 10 hours a day in front of computer
monitors. Often I am in front of several CRT monitors operating on different
refresh rates. It's very hard on the eyes. I'm thinking about improving this
scenario. Specifically I'm wondering about LCD monitors... are they much
better on your eyes? Is the quality as good as CRT monitors for graphics
(games)? Anyone else out there use multiple monitors? Any thoughts on eye
strain and LCD vs CRT?

TIA
