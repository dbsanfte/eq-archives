I can enter the game in 640X480 or 1024X768, but if I change to
800X600 the game kicks out and I get an error with my EQFGX_7DX
file.  Does anyone know what could be causing this problem.  I
have reinstalled the game, DX8.0a, and my newest drivers.  I was
using DX7.0a and I had the same problem.  I have a small screen
so 1024X768 just is too small.

Can anyone out there help?
I have a Gainward TNT2 M64 card.

JB
