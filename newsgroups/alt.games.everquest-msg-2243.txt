An enchanter isn't needed by necros most of the time.
Don't see much reason for a necro to need a wizard either.
Mage?  Certainly a powerful duo.
Druid?  Equally good for totally different reasons.

However, EQ is a game.  You play games to have fun.  If the majority of
people say "mage! mage!" and you'd really rather have an enchanter, will you
have FUN playing the mage?

The bottom line is this:  You're asking us to help you choose when you
shouldn't be.  Our opinion doesn't mean SQUAT because we can't read your
mind and cannot tell which class you'll have the most fun playing.

And hell, when he hits level 10 he may change his mind (after all, you
already changed your mind about iksars) and decide he really wants to be a
barbarian (*shudder*) rogue.  And there you are with your gnome wizard and
that's not exactly the most efficient pair.
