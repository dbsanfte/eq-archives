Ever seen a wiz wearing a ID 3 item and level 54 DD bracelet focus
item cast IC and get a crit on it?

I still find this a little hard to believe.....
pet would quad for around 50ish and seen warriors dual for 120
Unless your referring to a fire pet maybe or water pet with BS, don't
see pet could consistently outdamage a warrior of roughly the same
level, unless said warrior isn't always attacking or has crappy
weapons.

Hey never said the crits were fantastic... but with fully buffed with
focus items.. that little crit becomes nice little bonus.

Hehe.. evidently you don't group with wizards that much.
I was in group in Seb the other day and we had a 60 wiz join us for a
while.
In one fight he got THREE CRITS in a ROW..... count them THREE crits!!
I think they were on 2 different mobs tho
Granted, that is pretty frigging amazing and odds are pretty much
astronomical, but like I said it CAN happen!!
