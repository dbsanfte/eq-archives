This just cracks me up.  I've been called a VAK and worse for seeing
both sides of an issue or for refusing to jump on the bandwagon when
folks wanted to complain.  Not for defending mind you, but for simply
pointing out the big picture rather than focusing on just the negative
side presented by a poster or for the heinous crime of not believing and
not caring about someones story about how it was their brother who was
cussing up a storm on their account.  Anyone who feels the need to lable
someone else as a VAK is clearly intimidated by the other persons
viewpoint or message and lacking a response they turn to name calling to
take the focus away from the actual subject at hand.  Its a poor
debating technicque at best and quite a hoot to those of us far enough
removed from events to see it for what it is.  Somehow I'd rather have
idiots like Airtreader calling me a VAK than be an idiot like that
myself.
