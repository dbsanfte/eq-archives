    Time spent dodging adds that could have been avoided with Lull is also
time not spent medding. ;-) Just be sure to tag the mob you're pulling with
something lightweight and relatively low aggro, like your level 1 nuke.
Won't be hard for a warrior to taunt that off you, and you won't be using
more mana than required.
