Scale requires you to be grouped with them, and quite honestly even if
they're lying it's just easier to sow their asses.

In Steamfont last night a level 9 wizzie was begging for a port to Felwithe.
He was begging for at least 10 minutes, despite the fact that I THINK I made
it clear to him that it's only a 5 minute run.  He's probably still there.
Wonder when someone'll get around to telling him there's no such port. :)
