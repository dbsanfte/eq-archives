On an LDoN run today with some friends, I went LD.  When I came back 
there was some good natured ribbing in the shout channel as I hunted for 
them.  When I found them, they'd engaged a mob, had it down to 80% HP. 
I sent in pet, stared at the Follow button and shrugged, then nuked 
once, paused briefly, nuked again.  Got the little yellow exp box, then 
hit follow, said "who's the man now?" and then looted my kill after the 
ML was unable to do so since he wasn't grouped with me when the mob died.

Admittedly I'd only outdamaged a warrior and a ranger, since the 
enchanter wasn't good at getting her pet involved and had some strange 
idea that landing slow was helping despite the fact that it generally 
hit after the mobs started to run, and the cleric was legitimately busy 
healing.  On the other hand they -did- get a 20% head start...

My point is that after spending 30+ levels lamenting that my 
contribution to fights seemed minimal, it was nice to actually verify 
that by sending pet plus one or two nukes per mob I was indeed competing 
with the rest of the damage people after all.

ps yes, I /split 5 afterwards to distribute the massive pp I pulled off 
the body
