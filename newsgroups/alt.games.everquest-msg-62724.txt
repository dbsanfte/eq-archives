    It is quite potent - as others have pointed out, you can keep Allure of
Death on yourself at all times and your regen will handle the damage. That's
a permanent Clarity-level mana regen, with no ill effects. Other
necromancers can deal with it by Lifetapping back the damage, but that
implies a need for constant pulls.

    But ease of levelling is about more than the XP penalty. Do you need to
go somewhere to re-stock on food and beverages? You don't as an Iksar - you
have foraging. Do you need to travel far between your bank of choice and
your hunting grounds, or between hunting areas as you level? Not as an
Iksar - you never need to leave Kunark to go all the way to 60, and most
Kunark zones are within two zones of Cabilis. Are you supported at low
levels, which I found to be the hardest for a necromancer? As an Iksar you
have access to several quality newbie quests, and any tradeskill you can
imagine (like Tailoring for Raw Silk armour) is supported in Cabilis.

    There are some penalties for all of this. The inability to wear plate
armour means an Iksar necro can't wear GEBs or GCBs, which at present are
some of the better INT gear out there that's affordable. If you do choose to
travel to the Old World, you'll find faction to be a large hassle. But as a
class that can level with ease on a casual level, Iksar Necro is about as
good as it gets. My necromancer is an Erudite, so I have some idea what
other races can offer. 8)
