After a fight and I am LOM or OOM, I report how much mana I have, and do
not heal until I am at full mana. Then I'll be at 60 or 80m, and they'll
be full, and off pulling (and I can med while I wait).

I have found that if I heal them before I med up, they get impatient
waiting on a thing only I can see, and start pulling. 

Making them wait first keeps them aware of their own health, and it's
their rez if they pull before they are healthy.
