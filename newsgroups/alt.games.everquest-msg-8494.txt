Hehe. Well this is usenet did you expect anything different? =)

True but couldn't we use this argument to boil down almost anything
to its most basic component? Take football for instance, all you
do is move the ball past a line, then you do it again, and again
and again, etc., etc., etc. The 'game' is not getting the football
past the line, its 'HOW' you get it past the line that makes the game.

Ah yes I have the same problem. I think that is a 'flaw' in the game
rather than leveling, if we want to point one out. The fact that it is difficult
for a group of friends to adventure together if they all play at different times
and different lengths of time.

I still get like that once in a while, but I force myself to take a step
back and look at the larger picture. EQ is a very addictive past time
and it can be frustrating at times. But are we really so different than
the people that yell and scream at the TV when their team drops the
ball? =) Good things evoke a lot of passion and emotion, if EQ didn't
we'd move on to another game.

I think one of the reasons I have played EQ for 2 years
is 'because' its damn hard. It is without doubt the hardest game I have
ever played.
