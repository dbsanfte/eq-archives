Here's an example.  I know that if my child decides to dance in the bathtub,
most likely a fall will ensue.  I tell him of this fact, but he has the free
will to dance in the bathtub anyway.  If he does, he'll fall ... and I'll
let him.  Then he'll learn that a bathtub isn't a dance floor.

My kids have learned a lot of lessons that way.  They're hard headed ... no
idea where they get it from.  Probably my wife.  ;-)
