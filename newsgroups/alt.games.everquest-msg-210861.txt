Game play for a warrior seems to consist of: Win the fight and sit down for
a long time. For just about any other character you can put down time to
better use or have less of it. I mean a ranger can track their next target,
forage, maybe even heal themselves, that kind of stuff. I did run a warrior
just a bit and while it has some entertainment value, the long down time
really dilutes it.

It really should be improved. I think it could be improved and balanced.
Something like the "Highlander" where the warrior gets the choice between
looting the corpse or getting its lifeforce to replentish his own. Not too
unlike life tap, but the warrior has to win the fight to get it rather then
use it to help win the fight.
