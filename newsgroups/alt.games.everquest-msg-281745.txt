More likely because this guy is doing absolutely nothing illegal and they're
smart enough not to waste money on frivolous legal action that will
accomplish nothing.  =)

The EULA has the weight of a contract, not a law, and even that is
questionable.

And if anyone doesn't realize that using blatant exploits such as what can
be accomplished with MQ2 can get them banned...   good riddance.  The other
99.9% of the human population is intelligent enough to not need warned and
decide whether they want to take the risk.
