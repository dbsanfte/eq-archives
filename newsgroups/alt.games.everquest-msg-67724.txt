Hey, while your precious game is fucked - why not try talking with those
other people in your house (they are called family) or perhaps go outside
and interact socially.  You will find much has changed in the world since eq
was released, but don't be too afraid.  Rather than empty threats to Sony
and useless petitions, try putting something back into your community.
