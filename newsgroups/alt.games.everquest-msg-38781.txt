You can venture beyond Qeynos gates now, and start tackling some of the
critters in Qeynos Hills. Things will get a whole lot safer for you at
level 5, when you get your new song. There is a low level bard quest in
Qeynos, too, that you could do. Qeynos, in general, has a plethora of
quests to do; talk to all the NPCs you see. You might also check out the
ones in Surefall Glade.

I don't think too many people really use those message boards. People
still roleplay, but they are very, very rare. A great way to roleplay as
a bard is to travel around and perform concerts for the public (assuming
you have a modicum of poetic talent). Just realize that the majority of
EQ players don't give a crap about RP. However, if you persist, you may
find some good people out there. The guild I helped found on Prexus
started as a group of people who met because we always attended a
certain bard's concerts. We've since held several events over the years;
usually people respond well to them, they just need someone else to
serve as the catalyst.

Some people don't get it, though. I was having fun with my guildmates as
my rogue this weekend by doing /em quietly picks your pocket! mixed with
/em attempts to pick your pocket, but fails! You wouldn't believe the
tells I got. Even when I asked these morons point blank if they actually
NOTICED anything missing from their inventory, they wouldn't let up with
the 'give me my stuff back u fag'. Heh.
