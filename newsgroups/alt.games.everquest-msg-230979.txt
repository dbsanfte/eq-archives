Well, yeah, natch.

I used the timer mod for the UI to make a six second tick timer. When I 
zone into a zone, I set the slider right where the tick rolls over. That 
way, I know how to time my casts and "med run"[1]

[1] For those who don't know, "med run"(my term, unsure if there is 
another) is running for 5 seconds, then sitting for the tick rollover, then 
running for 5 seconds. It's a pain, but as long as you are sitting when the 
tick hits you get the full med bonus to mana and full sitting bonus to 
health regen.
