Lokari,
you claim this is a nerf, i think that it is more likely an expansion on
tailoring.  come on, this is verant, they didn't do this to 'ruin' the
backpack market, they did this because some new recipe needs a 10-slot
container to make it in.  time to start tinkering for new recipes.

btw, thanks for the site, saved most of your info to my hd to save you
bandwidth, may have to redownload again soon tho   :)
