Aloha,
    Yep, I ran into the same problem myself. Others will fill you in on Sony's change
in direction on the "support" of that board. In December I discovered that even with a
PIII/850 and over a gig of ram - not counting the 64 megs on the ATI board - my system
'choked' with even a couple of the enhacements on. By this weekend, I'l have up-graded
to a PIV / 1.8 gig chip with over a gig and half of ram memory. While that should be
the solution for the 'choking', I will probably continue to have some video problems,
like floating npc's when I zone, greyed landscape when I first log on to the game and
a couple of other glitches. The regular posters to this newsgroup can provide you with
the 'work arounds' for those problems. Basically you will discover that, depending on
your processor and ram, you will have to play the game with most, if not all, of the
graphics enhancements turned off. - redvet (Redakamai on the Tov. server)
