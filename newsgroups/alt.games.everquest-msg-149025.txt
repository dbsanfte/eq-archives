Which begs the question:  "Why are there more instances of
Donal's Vambraces for sale than any other piece of Kunark
armor, for any class!?"  What the hell are all the Clerics
wearing for sleeves?  Avg. price is about 350pp too, these
arms get zero respect on my server.  People pay more for the
Bracers of the Reverent, which are nice but nothing to
write home about.  In fact, as far as I can tell nobody buys
the Donal's Vambraces at all.  Every once in a while I'll
see one for less than vendor will pay and buy it with my
bazaar trader, over several hundred hours total I've sold
them once, for 400pp, most have ended up vendored.
