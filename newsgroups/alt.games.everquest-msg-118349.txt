Hm... I'm reading and re-reading what I wrote, and I still cannot imagine 
how you arrived to "ought not destroy life to survive" from it. What I 
convincingly (I think) demonstrated is that "what other animals do" is not 
valid ethical criteria for us humans, even if we are also animals.

I'm perfectly okey with destroying life to survive. The whole point of not 
eating meat is that it's *not* necessary to survive.

The wrong is not in eating meat; the wrong, from my point of view, is in 
killing animals for their meat, since meat is unnecessary for sustenance. 
If they ever come up with safe vat-grown meat, I'll probably be the first 
in line to tuck in.

Is there? Please explain, because I fail to see it. As far as I know, all 
those behaviours come as naturally (albeit, obviously, not as often) to the 
species in question as feeding does.

What exactly is amazing about it? Are you telling me that *your* own 
convictions don't stop where your own comfort and willpower draw the line? 
If so, please explain how you do it.

I would not become a vegetarian for health reasons... Vegetarians *do* have 
better health than meat-eaters in general, but not to the point where I 
would feel it justifies the inconvenience, as far as I'm concerned. The 
reason I do it is because I *do* actually believe I'm doing the world a 
favor. Don't take offence, but after thirteen years as a vegetarian, the 
fact that someone on Usenet happens to disagree carries extremely little 
weight with me. :)
