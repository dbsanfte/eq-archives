I have a 14th (just) level Necro.
 Now my understanding is that if my pet does 50% or more of the damage to a
mob I have to share my exp with it.
 However, if I am grouped with someone it only takes a flat 1% exp from the
group.

 If I am grouped with someone who is too low to get any exp at all (ie 1st
level)
    1/. Do I get all the exp? Or is a % still taken off me and just not
given to the other groupee.
    2/. Does my pet take 1% or 50% of the exp if he does most of the damage?
    3/. What if the other person is in the same zone but not close enough to
the action to grab exp? Does the pet exp stealing got back up again?

In case you're wondering, I have two operational PCs (actually 3 but one
operates as gateway) and two accounts, so I can happily create a 1st level
[X] to auto-follow my primary around.
