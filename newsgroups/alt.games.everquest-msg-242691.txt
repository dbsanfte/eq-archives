These two aren't really feasible, unless Sony wants to give up all pretense
that EQ is an RPG.  Iksar worked as a new evil race because they came from a
new continent, and there weren't any Iksar already in the old world.  So,
from an RP point of view, it was at least reasonably believable that while
the cities of the old world did not accept the Iksar, the more adventurous
citizens (e.g., the players) would accept them.

Orcs, however, have been enemies of most player races.  It would just not
make sense to see players grouping with Orcs.  The case against Undead is
even stronger.
