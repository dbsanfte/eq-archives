From the article on CR, it appears that it simply means multiple PCs
can cast the same DoT on the same mob and have the effects stack.
However, the same PC can't stack the same DoT on the same mob. So, 2
druids could cast DoD on the same mob and it'd kill it twice as fast.
The CR article also says that NPCs won't be given this ability, thank
god.
