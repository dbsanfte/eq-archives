Thankfully, both of our main MAs (a 60 and a 59 warrior who got his
epic last night) are extremely dedicated to the guild and great guys,
so there's no worry about them leaving us.
However, we have had people leave us for all kinds of reasons not too
long after getting their epics. The worst incident was a 60 monk that
joined, talked people into doing his last few fights on our weekly
epic nights, got his epic and proceeded to ebay the monk. It's almost
a shame he unguilded his shaman (which he'd gotten on ebay) before we
got the chance to kick his sorry ass out.
Because of all this, our trial members won't be getting loot or help
with epics anymore. It won't be a guarantee that we won't have more
fresh epics or ToV loot leave, but it should help discourage people
like that monk from applying in the first place.
