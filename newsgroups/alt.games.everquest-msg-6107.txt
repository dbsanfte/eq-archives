The easiest way out is to find someone who can port useally by that level
they are safe in Befallen. Askek him to fall down the pit group and port you
out. If you are on Prexus I will be able to do that for you. Next way is to
wait for a group that is down there and ask them to escort you out. You may
want to create a mule to stay on the first floor and and shout for some help
then relog on.
You are to young to go after the key so will have to get some help. Be sure
to keep invis to undead up.
