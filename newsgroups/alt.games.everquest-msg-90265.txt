Wow I cant believe the bitterness in these replies.  I actually think
the original post asked a valid question.  And there are some very
real answers to that question.

First of all, nukes at the end of a fight become increasingly
important at later levels.  Some mobs can ONLY be defeated with major
firepower as their hp drops to 1 or 2 bubs.  Without those nukes, the
mob may rampage or regen.

Secondly, with mage vs wiz, the mages nukes are slower, are smaller,
and are resisted more.  And the mages pet is largely useless in most
late game situations.

In lower level (pre 50) experience groups, mages do provide a lot of
damage with nukes, damage shields and pet.  But for sheer combustion
in the 50plus game you need wizards.

I have a lv 60 mage and wish the answer were other than it is.  But
I'm leveling a wizard now and loving it.
