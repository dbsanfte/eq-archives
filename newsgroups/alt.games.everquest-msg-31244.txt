It takes you anywhere between 1 to 3 mins to camp and log back in.
That's an awful lot of damage you're missing out on.  If you're
willing to pay that kind of price (loss in melee damage), you can just
wait outside the lair for the same duration.  

After a couple of minutes, the tanks had better be able to generate
enough aggro that when you get into melee range Yelinak doesn't
immediately turn on you.

BTW, a level 60 ranger with primal 1H + swiftwind at haste cap will
generate something on the order of 40 to 50dps. That's about 6000hps
of damage you're giving up if you sit out for 2 mins.  Or the
equivalent of 3 dragon's bane.
