I think you're kind of assuming that.  I don't recall in Ironeyes's post 
him saying, "and then, after the leader reinvited the dumbfuck rogue, we 
stood around for 5 minutes picking our noses before heading back to LCY".  
For all we really know, unless Ironeyes enlightens us further, there was 
only 2 seconds between the rogue rejoining and the puller calling "Inc 
mess".  It may have been awfully hard to time hitting the 'disband' button 
right in that interval.  Why, the leader could even have reinvited the 
rogue while they had already started fighting again.

Still, I would have rezzed him.  I would have left the group with all due 
haste thereafter though.  Not out of a sense of obligation or courtesy, 
but because I don't need someone I already know is an asshole running 
around with a motive to try and make my life miserable, by ruining my rep, 
or KSing me if they see me, or training my group.  Sometimes if you give 
the asshat what he wants, he'll be out of your life sooner.
