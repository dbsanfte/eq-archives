Pretty much right - however it ahs been said by some non-Paladins that a
Paladin who does his job is better than a warrior and a cleric together who
don't.  The other main function a Paladin has that is not mentioned here is
the role of Paladins as the master interruptor's, all the more so with SoL
with another 3 new stun spells, the ability to use bash will all two
handers, and the ability to stun mobs up to lvl 60 (not that great because
normal rules against giant mobs still apply).  This means that a Paladin
could almost be non-stop chain stunning mobs that are able to be.

The other important aspect of a Paladin is backup - a timed stun, root, LoH,
heal, or even taking over main tanks place can save the group or raid.
Paladin's are also quite good at escaping total wipeouts so they can rez the
cleric who then rezzes everyone else.

All in all yes, I think Paladin's are not that good a class game-wise, and I
would preferably like to see them have nearly as good as defensive
capabilities as warriors, even if it means warriors need to have more
offensive.

Also Paladins can be soloed relatively well depending on what they are
fighting - and from level 45 with mana-less DW helm heals can solo quite
effectively, though not as good as druids and necros/SKs.  But they are more
group oriented.

And yes, as you point out it really does take someone who knows the class
well for the Paladin to be really truely effective.

Anyway, nice comparison, as I said, not bad at all.  Just wanted to make my
observations of the class I play, and as you can see I am all for it :-).
And yes I am fairly heavy on roleplaying :-).
