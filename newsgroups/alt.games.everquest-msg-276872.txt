Nope, the civil suits were cut off by that legislation.  The intruder is 
presumed to be a lethal danger.  The intruder, should he survive, or his 
relatives, should he not survive, have no civil recourse, barring an 
ability to prove that the person was not there ilegally to begin with. 
This is all going by memory here though, so it is quite possible I am 
wrong about the details, it happened after I left California.
