I understand the problems of keeping short buffs up (mage DS anyone?)
The group I will be in most of the time has 3 casters in it already,
so at most it will be 3 hastes.

My biggest interest is the +resists when doing bosses during raids.
The +atk is nothing to sneeze at however.

Heh, you have to realize that my mage and my bst are on seperate 
accounts - you want to see cash farming, watch even a 54 bst with a
65 mage in AC.

The deal with hybrid discs is that they got moved to the new system.
We don't get new abilities per se.  However, some have been moved to
different timers.  You can now use Protective Spirit, then use the
