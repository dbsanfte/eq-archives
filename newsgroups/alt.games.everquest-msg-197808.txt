I will take *anyone's* word for it if they can eliminate the possibility 
of the various additional factors I have mentioned being just as big a 
cause for the problem. We could very well have a situation where the 
attitude of various people in these dissolved guilds is at the root of 
the problem, yet  because of the fact that is has seemingly happened to 
many guilds, eliminating the trials is viewed as a quicker, easier fix. 
If that *is* the case, then I am not out of line in claiming that the 
trials should not go away. To this point, I've heard some evidence that 
would point to other possible causes, but none that necessarily disproved 
my own theory.

I will say this. If a good EQ friend of mine with whom I had spent 
countless hours playing in many raids, missions, tradeskill support 
sessions, etc. got flagged and decided it was too much trouble to help me 
get through it, *that* would be the problem, *not* the trial. Getting 
through the trial is possible for anyone willing to work at it. Like I 
said, of *course* it's going to be much more difficult for the smaller 
family guilds. By the same token, those smaller family guilds will likely 
have a stronger bond to help them get through it.
