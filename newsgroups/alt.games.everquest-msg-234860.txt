I did the preorder thing for GoD. For some reason, I was under the 
impression that I was just going to be downloading some code today and 
be able to play. However, I've yet to see any sort of confirmation 
e-mail with an account key or such showing up this week or any sort of 
activiation instructions. Are they just mailing me a box for it with an 
account key in there? Or am I in fact downloading it (the patcher just 
ran a huge arse patch) and since I preordered online I don't even need 
an account key?

Anyone else doing this and understand what's supposed to happen? If I 
have to go buy another one, fine. Just trying to figure it out in advance.
