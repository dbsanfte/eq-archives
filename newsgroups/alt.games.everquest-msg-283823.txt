Hear, hear - with Feign Death, hp-leeching and (sometimes) the healing
Potions, I've never had to have a cleric save MY ass  :D  The quoted
web-forum poster REALLY doesn't get it!  Then again, a lot of clerics
think the sun shines out of their arse and think they're
indispensable... (Kidding :P)  Hell, I happily solo the Necro all the
time and could care less I haven't got a cleric to save my hiney.
