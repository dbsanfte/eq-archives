Reasonably safe. If you're not utterly stupid (i.e. not avoiding mobs
you see) or very lagged, you can make the run a thousand times
unharmed. I never ever got accidentally jumped there and neither
did hundreds of other people I assume.

: owners there KOS to Iksars? I'll slither on down and check this place

No.

Don't expect much from them, though. They are more to sell your loot than to
things for most. They don't even sell food, asfaik.

Btw, ever considered soloing? LOIO gets harder clockwise (starting approx
at the 'cabilis valley' entrance ... LOIO is 'pot shaped', the handle of
the 'pot' being the cabilis valley). I soloed my SK to level 30 in LOIO
without any problems.
