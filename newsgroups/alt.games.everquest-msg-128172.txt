With rare exceptions, good items are not gotten by soloing.  There
are two methods for getting good equipment.  One, group or raid
and win/spend points/convice people of your supremecy on the NBG
scale.  Two farm stuff you don't need, sell it to those lower than you
for whom it is great stuff, and save up and buy good gear for yourself.

This is true at level 10, and its true at level 60.  If its soloable by you,
its not as good as something you can buy by soloing a hundred
similar level mobs, looting everything they have and selling it, then
buying something thats worth 100 times what you could solo.

Unfortunately for the dedicated solo artist, much of the best gear
is no drop, which means you need to loot it yourself, and yet drops
off mobs or in zones that are almost certainly over your head solo.
Unless of course you are on FV in which case I hear that the irritation
of TLC is counterbalanced by an absence of no drops...
