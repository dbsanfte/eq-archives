On Zeb there were giant gnomes (ogre sized) in the EC tunnel yammering about
how the players have been using it to sell stuff for a long time but have
not been paying taxes, so they want us to start.  People were intent on
killing them (dumbasses) and in the 20 minutes that I was there, no GMs were
killed, and the population went from (get this)...

...175 players to 312 in EC

I have no idea how high it eventually got, but away from the tunnel there
was no appreciable lag with my computer (P4-1.6, 256MB 800MHz RAM,
GF2MX400-64).  Makes me wonder how many the zone can handle now...I thought
for sure it was going to crash at 175. :)
