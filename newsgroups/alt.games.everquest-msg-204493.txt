The xp part of the quest was nerfed some time ago.  The comments at
Allakhazam should tell you exactly when.  It was too good not to be a lot of
publicity, but the publicity brought it to the attention of SOE, which
removed a quest that made leveling from 35 to 51 (even beyond) trivial.  You
can use it to get plat, but the experience gravy train came to a halt (just
when I had a cleric bot I wanted to level up).
