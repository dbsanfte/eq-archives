More specifically:

"The entire EverQuest (EQ) universe (at present, 40 separate worlds)
is run on approximately 1,000 servers. These are located in our onsite
datacenter and at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego, less than a mile from
our offices). The mix is about 60/40 (here vs. AT&T CERFnet)."

Quote from interview at www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest.html of
Adam Joffe and Scott McDaniel, both of SOE.
