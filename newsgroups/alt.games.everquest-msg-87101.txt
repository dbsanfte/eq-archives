Even the plain ol' version of EQ now runs on the new directx 8.1 graphics
engine, you just dont get the option of the new models/character race. You
dont quite need Luclin hardware to run it, but you do need an upgrade to
previous version of EQ. 'Least thats how i understand it. It runs fine on my
old machine - p3 450 with 128 mb ram. I got the cover disk so i could have
EQ on my old machine and my new one, so I could try playing 2 at once. Looks
crap now compared to the new Luclin models, but at least I can try it out
with a soloing duo.
