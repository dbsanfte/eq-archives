On a side note, I saw some ranger last night plinking arrows at the
Nexus Scion in NK from a distance. Apparently, the scions are "glued"
to their spot and won't chase. He says none of the arrows ever
hit...in fact, I never even saw a miss message when standing next to
either him or the scion, but she never reacted to the arrows, either.
He said he was just doing it to kill time while waiting for the port
to fire off.
