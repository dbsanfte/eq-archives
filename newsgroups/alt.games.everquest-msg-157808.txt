My brother's warrior uses any multiple of weapons but the ones he likes best
are the blood point (fast peircer w/lifetap) and club of the ice ocean (1hb
nice ratio w/150ish dd).  He has no problem taking agro off me when my slows
get resisted.
I'd say go for a quick proc'ing weapon and you'll own agro ;)
