 On the flip side. that's not necessarily the way it doesn't work.
Before when I hit ID whever it was available, ID wouldn't go off much.
However, when I time it so that the kick lands when my Flying Kick is
ungreyed, I land ID much more often.

 But hey,  try it out yourself. If you don't find that it works for you,
you can go back to mashing ID everytime it becomes available.
