    Well, for me its the whole "the children and grandchildren will be spending
their whole lives on the farm" thing that really ices the cake.

  Ok, I can sorta see why a guy would like to have a bunch of blond wives with
slim waists and pert boobies living in his cult having his 17 kids.  This is a
slim sorta sorta, you understand, but still.  But to assume that he's going to
have the power to keep his spawn trapped in his utopia for the rest of their
lives?  

   I got pissed off at my dad when he forbad me from joining the army.  And from
marrying Lenny.  I probably would have stabbed him to death in his sleep if he
tried to force me live in his little weirdo cult with his multiple wives.
