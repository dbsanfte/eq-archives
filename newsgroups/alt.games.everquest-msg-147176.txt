Yup. I have noticed the same thing, my friend refers to Cabilis as
Cah-bih-lee, like chablis wine ;))
Also my paladin is called Koochulainn (Koo-kul-in) but everyone
automatically shortens it to Kooch, which I would pronounce as rhyming with
hooch.


PS, it is Man-uh, and Fih-ree-own-nah Vee. ;) IMHO
