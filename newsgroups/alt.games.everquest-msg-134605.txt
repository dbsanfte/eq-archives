Got a guild full of people you can trust not to load
you up with viruses?  How about just a buddy?

Why not FTP the patch files around to each other
instead of clogging up the official patch server?

As soon as one member of your guild gets the
patch (preferably with his blindingly fast T1)
you go to alternate distribution, and the rest
of your guild gets to opt out of the slow and
ineffective patch server nonsense.

They still have to struggle thru the other people
who are downloading their own versions of
the new files, which means this only saves them
a little time... unless most guilds across most
of EQ implement the same plan.  If 75% of
the people don't need to sit there for an hour
each downloading thru the EQ bottleneck,
but instead just log in, check files, and go
on to connect, the whole bottleneck rapidly
vanishes.

Best thing about this plan is its proactive, it
doesnt require that EQ does a thing
