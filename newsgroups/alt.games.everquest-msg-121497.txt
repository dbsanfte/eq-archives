It depends on what you want to do with the charmed pet.

I think enchanters have an easier time charming because their charm lasts a lot longer.
On the other hand, lasting a long time is not always a good thing.  Bards use the short
charm time to their advantage when using the "swarm kiting" tactic.  Once their charmed
pet has been beaten down within a bub or so of death, the bard lets the charm wear off
then finishes off the pet himself to get full xp for the kill.  A good soloing bard can chain this tactic
through a swarm of mobs making lots of xp in a relatively short period of time.  However
this takes a lot of practice and can be the cause of a lot of frustrations and death early in your
training. Note also that a bard can't charm till level 27, whereas an enchanter gets charm at
level 12.

With the new pet rules, which I think might also apply to charmed NPC's, an enchanter
can charm one monster to attack another.  If the two NPC's fighting each other are equally
matched, the enchanter's pet can win because the enchanter can deal additional damage.
And in fact *must* deal additional damage in order to get full xp for the kill.  If the enchanter
does no damage of his own, he'll only get 25% of the xp, and no xp if his pet dies first.

I play both classes, and so far I like the bard slightly better.  My enchanter's only level 17, though,
so take my opinion with a grain of salt.  My bard is level 43.
