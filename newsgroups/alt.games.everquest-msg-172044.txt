Am I the only one that expects NBG in a pickup group? Am I the only one who 
*never* wins loot rolls?

Last night, in Karnors, a tranquil staff dropped. I have been drooling over 
this piece of gear for literally a year.

The shaman walked off with it at the end of the night, although he did let 
me play with it for the evening. My damage was sick, despite my 2hb skill 
of 180. 

I am not overly pissed, just a bit dissappointed... if something awesome, 
worth a lot of cash(45k on my server), and only shaman useable had dropped, 
I would have either not rolled or used my roll to give him the item if I 
won(if noone else thought NBG was a good plan). Is it silly to expect NBG?
