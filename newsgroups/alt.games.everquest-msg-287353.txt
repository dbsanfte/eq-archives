One of the best benefits of marriage is that you have a permanent
dating partner. Don't let the fun end after the honeymoon. Here are
some ideas for fun dates.

1. Spend an afternoon at the opera. These aren't as expensive as you
might think. Check out a local college for possible discounts on
campus performances. If you go, be sure to check out the plot of the
story beforehand.

2. Sample a variety of cafe's. Instead of just staying at one
restaurant, have dinner at one place and dessert at another. Try to
find places within walking distance, this way you can enjoy the
scenery.

3. Head to the zoo. The zoo can be quite a fascinating place. Check
out everything from pengiuns to gorillas. If you're more of an aquatic
fan, check out your nearest aquarium.

4. Up for peanuts! A summer ball game is always fun, whether it's
major league or little league.

5. Hit the outdoors. Pack a lunch and head to the nearest trails or
even learn to kayak.

6. Check out the museums. Whatever your interests, you're sure to find
a museum that matches your tastes. The next time you're out on a
dinner date. Stop in at a museum before-hand.

7. Picnics are always a pleasure. Pack a lunch and a blanket and head
to your nearest park.
