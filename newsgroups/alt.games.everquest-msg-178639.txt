If you like the "windowed look" without anything over you picture, try
the viewport comand:
if you're running 1024x724 resolution on your screen
/viewport 100 0 800 600 will give you a nice "action window" in the
middle and plenty of black space to put all your other windows.  And
this goes into the "standard" UI, so you don't have to redo your UI
after every patch.
