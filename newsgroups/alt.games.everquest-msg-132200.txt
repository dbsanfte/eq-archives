It was *NEVER* planned for the US version of the show.  Any and all press
releases and articles I've seen on this issue all stated very clearly that
this was for the South African version only.  The only one who has ever made
any statements concerning a US character with AIDS was you.  Get your facts
straight before you start a tirade next time.  (IMO  it would be wonderful
to have such a character on the US version; your prejudicial ranting has
demonstrated the need for more education concerning this disease).
