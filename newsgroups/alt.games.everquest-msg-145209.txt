Hi

Are Half-Elves a so much bad race?
Is there any class they are good at?
I thought half-elven bards and druids were quite good.
I must admit I tried many of the available races but I did never 
create any half-elven character. This idea never came to me while I 
was curious to see how a Troll Shaman would evolve, as an example.
