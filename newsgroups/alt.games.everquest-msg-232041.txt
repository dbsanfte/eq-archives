That was a single example, not a comprehensive list.  Both of them were very
abusive - cussing to make a sailor blush, calling people names (and I mean
FOUL names) in guildchat, etc.  And it wasn't just one occasion - it was a
regular pattern, to the point no small number of guildmembers 'had to log'
if they found out the co-guildleader was leading a particular raid.

This particular event was a pre-Velious Hate raid; people were still porting
in and there was all of two broken mezzes - and I was an enchanter, so no, I
didn't break any mezzes.  Nor was it like we had one enchanter for the
entire raid (we had two) so if one enchanter died it wasn't the end of the
world.

Anyway, I'm not trying to dig up old wounds - was just giving an example.
