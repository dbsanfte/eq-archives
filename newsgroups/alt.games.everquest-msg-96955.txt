It'd just be like Douglas Adams' 'Somebody Else's Problem Field'... people 
would gloss over anything so big and incongruous and obviously out-of-place 
since it wouldn't gel with their nice sane world view. You'd be upstairs in 
an inn somewhere, glance over to the corner of the room to see a hulking 
great troll trying to stand very still with a lampshade on his head, and 
your subconcious would think, 'Is that a troll? No, can't be, that would 
just be silly - must be a lampstand, my eyes are just playing tricks with 
me', and your concious mind would just gloss over it. It follows that 
trolls are really the stealthiest, most expert masters of disguise in the 
game.
