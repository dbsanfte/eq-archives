OK, as a bard who has solod in a number of zones, and who has hunted
in PoG quite a bit, I'm gonna ask how in the hell a bard solos in PoG?
I guess you could chant-kite, but the Protectors of Growth are a real
pain in the ass, aren't charmable by a bard, and kick serious ass
meleewise.  Not only that, I've been stuck in the PoG, and if you
don't have a gate potion, you're not getting out as a bard.  
Bard soloing generally is only effective if you have a zoneline to run
for when things go wrong, and in outdoor areas with lots of room to
run with no wanderers, or big outdoor areas where mobs spawn in twos.
I guess with a gate potion and few mobs up in PoG I could do OK there,
until the PoGs spawn, at which point it's time to get a group tough
enough to hold off the PoGs while we rez and gate.
Now PoM maybe, before the most recent upgrade, except that almost
everything is too high to charm, other than the pansies in the forest.
Maybe I could solo the rats in the maze, but that takes more balls
than brains.  

Arolpin
/gu anyone available to come rez me in the maze?
