Going completely skill-based and getting rid of levels entirely is interesting.

Tradeskill advancement based on people using your goods, rather than you
making them, is interesting.

Bounty hunting sounds like it could be fun.  That might be enough to get me
to try the game *after* it has been out for quite a while.

However, it is Sony and Lucas.  Sony's record has been spotty for handling
big things (remember the Luclin launch?), and this will be big.  Sony's
technical expertise combined with the mighty Lucas marketing machine is not
something I want to go near anywhere near launch date.
