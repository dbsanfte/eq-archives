Almost as well as a druid?  Make that better than, and by quite a
substantial margin after lvl 51.  From 51 onwards Wizard AEs are leaps and
bounds beyond Druid ones.  Our AE snare is more effective than a Druids and
our "Staff of temperate Flux" allows us to pull 4 mobs while on the move in
a short space of time.  At lvl 51 i could Quad kite 4 Wyverns in Cobalt Scar
with about 2 bubs of mana left over...  The druids who were attempting this
at around 52 seemes to be having a very hard time.  When hunting spirocs in
tim deep,  myself and a druid guildy timed to see who could kill the most in
a given amount of time... it worked out that i was killing 16 spirocs to his
12 every single time.  Wizards with the right gear, ie Jboots and Staff of
Temp flux, are incredible soloers...particularly past 51, where it begins to
slow down for a druid....in fact my wizard solos for exp much better than my
55 necro (who is still the best soloer for single mob encounters)

Alakazar Kaaboom 52 Wizard
Jamman Darkdaddy 55 Necro
Zagas 41 Druid
