    This could be a hassle to administer. First exploit I thought of: create
a guild with the founding ten members all being from different teams, and
have everyone be an officer. The GMs will have to check to make sure any
guild created is "legal", especially considering that races can have people
on different teams.

>> 16. Beneficial spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels

>> restrictions on spells over 50th level will supercede this rule.

    The second note isn't needed, as the spell restrictions on spells over
level 50 include the 20 level rule (nobody level 39 can be Heroismed,
right?)

>You can't get rezzed until level 19 (CMIIW)

    Heh, no. I can cast Reviviscence on a low level character just fine. I
imagine the restriction will be on any spell that must be targetted. Note
that this also kills casting beneficial spells that aren't targetted, since
they usually require grouping - and there's no cross-team grouping.

>You can't get teleported to specific places until you're high enough.

    Again, I bet the spell restrictions will NOT stop non-targetted spells.
Just don't have the lower-level targetted when casting, and all should be
fine.

>> The 'Teams':
>>
>> The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr, Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet
>> Nife, Quellious, Tunare

    Humans, High Elves, Wood Elves, Barbarians (with the change), Erudites.

>> The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk,
>> Rallos Zek

    Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres, Iksar, Gnomes, Erudites, Humans, most races'
warriors (not Dwarves).

>> The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana,
>> Prexus, Solusek Ro, The Tribunal,
>> Veeshan.


    Humans, Barbarians, Erudites, Halflings, Gnomes, Dwarves, and the
INT-casters that follow Sol Ro.

    Offhand, I'd say the evil team is going to murder the other teams.
Cabilis, Oggok/Grobb, and Paineel are all remote enough and have enough
nearby levelling available that evils can level up in peace, and to quite
high levels. Those areas are also uniformly evil. If humans in Freeport go
mostly evil (and there's no reason to pick another team except masochism),
then evil will control everything from Lake Rathetear to Sol B, including
EC, and also much of Kunark. Neutrals are spread thin, but have all the
classes except Necromancer/SK and might be able to hold their own in places
like Halas/EF, Butcherblock/FV, and central Antonica (with the 10000
halfling dr00ds that'll start). Unless a ton of players decide to be good
Barbarians, the good team will be Team GFay/LFay.

    Barbs and half elves can wear human cultural smithing, so the only
update required would be an imbue on Northman armour for Mith Marr. Since
some deity/race combinations are already left out in cultural, I wouldn't be
surprised to see this left out, too.
