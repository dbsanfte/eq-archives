Dark elves were created by Innoruk. He captured the First Elven King and
Queen and slowly tore them apart both physically and mentally over three
hundred years. then he took what was left and reforged them into Teir'Dal
(dark elves). I'd say that's a pretty good reason for most of the good races
to hate them.
