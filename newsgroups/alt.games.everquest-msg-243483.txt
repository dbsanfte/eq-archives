When dealing with high dps mobs like hard ldon or god zones, you're
doing your cleric a big favor by using healing messages. Timing heals is
markedly different between an unslowed mob and one that's even partially
slowed, so at least a good healer is aided by knowing when slow has
landed in terms of not casting heals too soon and wasting mana.

With my shaman in normal 65 ldon missions, if I have to malo twice I may
as well no bother casting slow, as the mob is now 3/4 dead. Of course
I'm still using the unresistable 60 malo so I don't have to cast it
twice but if I still get a resist on my first slow it's usually a debate
whether it's worth a second attempt in most group's I've been in, the
mobs just die too fast.

I use heal spam messages to let backup healer know what's going on. No
sense both healers casting at the same time, and good backup healers, if
you can actually find one, actually count out the 10 sec it takes for ch
to land, at least in god zones, where the dps is high but spiky. One of
the more interesting changes with god is the high dps, but still blue
conning mobs. The amount of damage they do is much less predictable,
sometimes I can start a ch at 60% and almost lose a tank, other times
starting at 60% only heals slightly over half his health. Of course, on
the other hand, because they're blue, the experience tends to suck for
the level of challenge they are.
