Being a shaman, I've usually been saving up for spells instead of gear
so I've always had a pretty high percentage of gear that I actually
got myself, and I like it that way. Looking at my magelo, I've got two
pieces of bazaar gear, 4 items that were given to me by friends who've
gotten a lot more uber then me over the past year and the rest are
items that I looted/quested myself.

Those two paragraphs don't really go together. You're saying that the
items you loot are so mediocre, then talking about the rare items
going to the bazaar. I don't think you can have it both ways here.

I find it pretty sad that the only people you can picture using NBG
are communists, idiots and liars. You left out a couple though: 

d) So uber (relatively speaking) that the loot in any given camp is
meaningless to them. 
e) Willing to put up with the (rare, ime) loot-whore because they
actually enjoy being able to use gear that they loot and don't mind
seeing the same with other people. 
f) Just don't care about loot all that much and are quite happy
playing their character with whatever items they've picked up along
the way.

The 'C' types are usually pretty easy to find, it really isn't that
hard to get a feel for how well equipped someone is. My experience is
that people calling NBG on an item is pretty rare, maybe 20% of the
items in LDoN go NBG and with most of those it was pretty obvious that
they were upgrades for the person.

Well, some of us just aren't that hung up on the 'ripping us off'
part. But yeah, if you go into every NBG group expecting to be cheated
I guess I can see your point.

It's not a simple correlation but I've always found that watching how
people deal with loot in a pickup groups is a pretty good indicator of
whether they're worth putting on my friends list and go out of my way
to group with them in the future or not. It's not a matter of whether
they want to do random or NBG, just watching how they react to loot in
general. 

Honestly, I don't recall the last time I actually took something NBG
in a pickup group, i tend to go with friends if we're going after good
loot. So the items that tend to go NBG in those groups are lower end
stuff and if I lose a 1 in 6 shot at some item worth 10k because of a
loot-whore, what's the big deal? It was a small price to pay to find
out that I don't want to group with that person again. 

Call it Kharma, but the gifts I've received over the years in EQ more
than make up for any losses there.
