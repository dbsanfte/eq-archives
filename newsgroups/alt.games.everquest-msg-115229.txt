Yeah, killed/got faction on approximately 20 dirfs there once, went from
amiable to... amiable, then went to Kael and killed about 20 giants and came
back to Thurg at kindly.  If you're going to use an example, make sure that
it works, dirfs give extremely small faction hits (well, except the named,
but it's not like I was going to be killing Dain) whereas nearly all giants
give major/semi-major hits.

Guess what clerics and enchanters get?  A spell called gate!!!  Guess what
it does?  PORTS THEM OUT!!!

Oh, and I have necro friends who would've been happy to summon my corpse out
for me, assuming I had died, also assuming Vox hadn't.

We also had managed to do the whole thing BEFORE Ice Giant repops, so the
only thing between Vox's lair and the zone out was a light blue Ice Giant
diplomat, and an assload of green goblins that a rogue of high enough level
to kill Vox can solo.

Been there, done that, know permafrost like the ass of my hand.  I've soloed
and duoed Ice giants there a few times.
