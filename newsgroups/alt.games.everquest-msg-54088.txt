Lol, I'm married.  Getting laid is the "same old potatoes" now.  If it ain't
Stove-top I don't want it.

This isn't the real world.  It's a game.  No-one cares whether I can take
out the opponents in Unreal Tournament either.  I can live with that.

I like Drinal because of all the funny names...

Someday I will get bored of this game like all others at some point just
like you.  The real problem is my 4 year old daughter is hooked on "Barbie

than a female woodelf in banded armor.  I think I'll give it a spin...
