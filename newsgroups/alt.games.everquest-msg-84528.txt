I'm baffled by why Verant has so much trouble with sound. They've
never been able to write a sound engine that worked well across common
hardware and operating systems.

Engine-wise, it's a serious resource hog. Of that there can be no
doubt. Even relatively high-end systems are challenged by it.
Personally, I think the problems are inefficient design rather than
the tasks the engine has to perform, but that's just my opinion.

As for the moon, do go. Some of the zones are positively stunning in
appearance, and while cities are pretty laggy, most of the outdoor
zones are quite playable.
