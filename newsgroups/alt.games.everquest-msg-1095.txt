A raid is not a guild or couple of guilds going into a dungeon;
a raid is more than one group coordinating their efforts on
any one project.

Normally raids are run by guilds, since there is a closer knit
community an lots better communication, but I have been on
a couple "pick up" raids into Kael Drakkar, where the several
groups fighting in EW's RyGorr fort looked at each other and
said "hey, this is too crowded, why don't we get together and
go plunder KD?"

Raids come in all shapes, sizes, and flavors.  Often a raid does
go in to take over a dungeon, camping every spawn and collecting
a large quantity of loot.  Other raids, though, are focussed on
a single piece of loot (most famously killing Sir Lucan so a paladin
can get a piece of his Soulfire quest) or on general exploration
(my guild ran raids on MM and Kedge primarily just to see
what the places were like, as most of us had never been to
either) or on experience.

In many ways the experience raids are the most difficult to
run; usual raid construction will see one group getting almost
all of the kills.  Two methods for sharing out exp:

1)balanced groups... this is tricky, and will likely require some
juggling before you get it right.  As a cleric, I found that with
relatively balanced groups, I could control which group got
the kill... if I nuked my group would get the kill, if not the other
slightly more powerful group would.  Since I was only nuking
every other fight, this didn't cause serious mana flow problems.

2) "High level" and "low level" groups.  When the a relatively
difficult creature comes in, everyone goes at it flat out, and
naturally the high level group outdamages the low level one.
On lower level mobs, the high level group takes it easy, and
lets the low level group outdamage them.  More difficult with
more than two groups, but large raids like that generally
spread out across the raid zone or are not exp oriented.
