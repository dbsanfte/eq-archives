Most true "Noobs" do not buy KEI. It is players in their teens, 20's &
30's that obtain KEI that are a PITA. They are blast addicts and not
learning group techniques. In many places, they can earn enough PP to
mainline on KEI.

A few know how to use it wisely, but many do not. I really don't care
about others techniques, except when it affect me. They can play the
game the way they like, but KEI has become (up to 40's) equivalent to a
big neon sign saying "idiot player".
