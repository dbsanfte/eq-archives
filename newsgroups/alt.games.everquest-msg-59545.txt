You can't since no emulator seems to have the ability to run directX
in hardware accelerated 3d. I think Wine actually works for some 2d
games but not any 3d like that unless they are also Open Gl.

EQ will never be Open GL since verant does not want you to be able to
run it in Linux. In Linux they'd not be able to have the control they
have in windows such as making it so you can't natively alt tab out of
it and get back in (you still can in various ways with various graphic
drivers and windows oses though)

Wine is a very poor alternative to windows. Any time you run something
in an emulator its slowed down. The only games which run probably
about as good under wine are things like Half life which are fully
open GL so use the open gl you have set up in linux and more or less
just start with Wine sort of. Wine is for really only one purpose, to
run things under linux since you don't want to run windows ever (and
if the things actually work) 

I found that some programs such as the 
Agent newsreader and in turn infraview to open up pictures in the
agent newsreader, work great with wine in linux. By using those, which
I also use in Windows, I'm able to use the newsreader and graphics
program that I like in windows under linux also which is more or less
what Wine is good for. A few games run similarly well. Usually there
are glitches here and there.

No one can run EQ in Linux since it just can't be done. 

Some good places to look for info:

Wine with windows games:
(as you can see most of the newer games which work well are 2D
strategy type games)

Wine X and more wine info:
