Some more information please.  What model of the LinkSys Router are you
using.  There are two different four port models, a one port model and a 8
port model.

OS, Router Firmware version, is your router's WAN IP setup as static or
dynamic, etc...

A lot of cable companies will "push" a cable modem if the hostname is not
correct, in which would essentially reset your connection to the internet.

Are you using the DMZ feature of the router?  Are you implementing the IP
forwarding?

EverQuest uses UDP ports, so there isn't anything that you need to put in
the routers NAT since it deals with TCP only (unlike NetGear's router).

Feel free to send an email if you want further assistance.  Those that tell
you to read the manual, well, I have compared and reviewed many of the
household routers (one of which I kept for myself to work alongside of my
Cisco 1605C) and all of them came with worse manuals than EverQuest.
