In the dog tower in KC, after a patch that did not mention any pathing 
changes, pulls toward the entrance now path like a paperclip before 
continuing on towards the entrance.

My point being is that you don't have that experience yet, and one little 
zigzag out of the way can bring a few casters down on your head.

Yeah, I admit that was a cheap gibe ;)

all out != needlessly risky.

maximizing odds of success != lazy and timid

So, what % do you pull at in a Tier 2 plane?

There's only so much you can do with 20m, and only a tiny margin for error.

My point is to leave yourself some wiggle room- and 20m when a chunk of it 
will go to heals and slows in the first place is not a lot of wiggle room.

For mana efficiency purposes, I CHeal early in the first few fights. I 
watch the mobs and get a feel for just how fast the MA loses HP. Then I 
adjust where I start my cheal so it lands when he is around 25%.

Take away 25% of his HP, and we have a situation. Especially since I might 
not notice "blah feels dispelled" or whatever in the onslaught of 
battlespam, and if I do i have no way to know it is virtue that dropped.

I want to postulate that cheal comes close to landing in time, but does not 
(or worse, you get the instant targets_corpse targeting bug and the CH 
*does* land... on a corpse). Now I have, say, 500 mana to deal with healing 
the ranger or rogue that is tanking now.

No, it's running back for the rezzes when that one CHeal was all he had and 
you pulled anyway.

I suppose you /g "WAIT NOONE ATTACK TIL I GET THIS SNARE OFF!"?

In case you had not noticed, there is a finite amount of time involved, and 
aggro to be managed..

Yeah, whatever. I know now that there is *no way* that a Mage could have a 
sow last longer than his groupmates deep in a dungeon.

Once again, you are putting words in my mouth.

Once you pull, mana regulating is gone. Now you do what you can with what 
you've got.

You don't regen mana any faster at 20m than 60m, so I will ask you one more 
time: Why is 20m "faster" or better than 40m or 60m?

Answer this question, and I shut up and accede that you are right and 
common sense is wrong.

Dodge it again, and this conversation is over, as you are talking to hear 
your own voice.
