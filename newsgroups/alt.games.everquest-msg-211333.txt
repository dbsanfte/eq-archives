Doggies have been parses at around 1k damage each, so the first level
of SC will give you 3k extra damage every 12 minutes, the pets are
active for 1 minute with a 12 minute refresh.  It comes out to about
4DPS if you cast it as soon as it refreshes and are fighting non-stop.
Not very useful if you look at it that way but I love the puppies.
They give you the option to tank mez an add, even if it's a caster.
Root, back up, cast SC and you won't have to worry about that mob for
a minute. They're also very good at interrupting casters, even an NPC
has a hard time betting a spell off with the puppies beating on him. 

Lastly, if you solo a lot it can be a godsend. Soloing something like
a Guardian Wurn, I can root halfway through the battle, channel SC and
back me and my pet out while the puppies tank for a minute. It
basically gives me a minute long breather in the middle of a fight. 

After Cann5, I'd rank SC, VP and RC as the 3 most useful AAs (for a
non-raiding shaman). Radiant Cure 1 is a steal at 2AA, I'm surprised
at how often I use it. Virulent Paralysis is only 3AA and gets used
constantly. Got 2 mobs hitting on your tank? Hit VP and you just
parked one of them out of melee range. Got a mob hitting on you?
Channel VP and you just parked him in the corner w/o having to root
and scoot. It's only downside is that it's useless against mobs that
are disease resistant. 

Of the more traditional AAs, SCM3 will save you 10% mana on all your
spells, SCR3 will make your buffs last 30% longer. Which one is more
useful is a matter of preference but I prefer SCM <shrug>.
