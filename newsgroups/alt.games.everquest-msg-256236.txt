Well if you are on FV, you can't bind right at the entrance, in this case it
is good to use common sense. Bind at the soulbinder if you are on EF, NR, EC
camps. BB & SR are closer if you bind in POK since Grobb and Felwith are
closer than the camps. This would be the same route I would use for a melee
as well. Though any of the camps are fine if you are already bound at one,
it is at least closer most of the time.
Of course unless you are bound somewhere WAY out of the way you should be
able to get back pretty quick, of course I always feel the only reason to
rez is that person that is out of the way, on FV that should not be anyone
any more (used to be the person bound in Gunthak (sp?), now is the ocasional
person bound in Veskar (I think you can still bind there)) since POK or an
LDON camp is probably the best place to bind.
