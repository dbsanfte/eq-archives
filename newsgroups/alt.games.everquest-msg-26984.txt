Dear Diary,
                 Today i looted a burned out lightstone, I never imagined this
single item would lead me on an epic quest fraught with dangers and powerful
enemies, which was lucky, because it didn't. Wandered over to Freeport to visit
my mother (she insisted), turns out she is dating a klicknick worker called
"Barry". Overheard an argument about a bread quest aswell. My hatred for
newbies grows.
Newbs killed by : 1002 (very busy in freeport)
Newbs killed: 4

Dear diary,
                I feel terrible. We had a party last night, got very drunk and
Barry drunkenly told me he was my real father!! as if! a klicknik worker, i
dont think so. Im leaving freeport and returning home to qeynos. I hate it
here, sometimes i think the newbies want to call a truce, they say "Hail a fire
beetle" and i turn around all excited only to find they have accidentally
targeted me rather than the passing higher level player they're begging from.
"Hail a fire beetles corpse" just snaps it off.
Newbs killed by : 110 (i sulked far away by the zone)
Newbs killed: 25 (In my anger i would shout "Klickniks suck the sweat from dead
newbs balls" and when they chased me i trained the naked newbies)
