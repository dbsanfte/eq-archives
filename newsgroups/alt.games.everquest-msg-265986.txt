   Does anyone here know where I can buy some exploding dye packs that
could be used to booby trap a tv dinner to detonate upon opening of the
box?  I tried google and ebay but no love there.  If there are no vendors
of these items to the general public, does anyone know how I and Lenny
might be able to construct the same?  We don't want to take someone's hand
off or anything, just coat them with some suitable, hard to wash off bright
purple dye.  

   Thanks in advance for any insight any of you might have.
