You really don't have a clue, do you?

Because, genius-boy, your response made little sense without context,
while the context showed you to be not only ignorant but not especially
clever.  Of course, that's to be expected of some dumbass of an ezboard
child who's too damned lazy to quote specifics and just top-posts
without snipping instead.

As it happens, you're rationalizing your ignorant lazyness like some
13 year-old caught playing games instead of doing homework.

I do thank you, however, for making it clear that I needn't bother
to read any more of your posts.
