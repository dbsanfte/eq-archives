    Sure, if you refrain from making harsh, judgmental posts
were you say speak for most of the people here, and then
threaten mass plonking.  Yes, I know being kill filed isn't
really as traumatic as being burned at the stake no doubt
was.  But I maintain that the core attitude of intolerance
for the mere mention a certain topic (heresy, or players
auctions) invites the comparison, whether you welcome the
comparison or not.  
    You're not in charge of the newsgroup, DT, and you're
certainly not in charge of decided what I, or anyone else,
can or cannot post.
