If you want to make some cash fast stop leveling for a few sessions and make
leather padding.

1) First head to The Ferrott, as you zone in from the Troll swamp hang a
Right and run along the wall to a ruined druid ring, no guards wander by
here but there are loads of spiders and spiderlings (Both spiders and
spiderlings in Ferrott drop 'Ling silks).

Should take around 1 - 2 hours to get about 6 - 10 stacks of silks.

2) Next head to Marus Seru, your targets are Rockhoppers, at your level you
might find some are still Light blue, but they will drop fast (its also
worth noting at most players dont loot the pelts off dead bodys so help
yourself to them).

Collect both the Normal "rockhopper pelt" and the "Low quality rockhopper
pelt".
You need 1 LQ pelt for every 2 'Ling sliks I.e if you have 4 stacks of silks
(80 in total) you need 40 LQ pelts, they drop at least one pelt nearly every
kill so you will want to have about 2-3 hours or so to burn.

3) Head back to the bazaar and find the merchant selling mask patterns, buy
1 mask pattern for every "Rockhopper pelt " you have.

4) If you havent already, go put a few points into tailoring

5) Next take 2 'ling silks (unstacked) place in loom or kit and combine.
This makes silk threads,

6) Place 1 "rockhopper pelt" and 1 mask pattern in your tailoring kit or
Loom.
continue until this trivs out or you run out of pelts (you will fail alot,
but its an easy way to boost your tailoring skill and mask patterns are dirt
cheap)

7) Finally take 1 Silk thread and 1 LQ rockhopper pelt and combine to make
leather padding.

8) Buy trader bag, and sell padding for 20pp per chunk (It can go for up to
40pp but at 20pp I ALWAYS sell out over night and often have tells asking
for more)

Now you should have a much better choice of items you can afford.
