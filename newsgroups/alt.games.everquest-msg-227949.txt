    Hiring Thomas King was a stroke of genius. His UIs for EQ have been
insanely popular due to their combination of artistic excellence and
functionality. Having him do the UI on a new game is instant brownie points
with the gamers you hope to win over to your new game. The artists they
hired are very popular, but you never know how much you'll be able to see
their work in game. The UI is in your face every second.

    I think this is one of the first games to come out and hire people with
that much recognition for key roles right from the get-go. EQ did have Keith
Parkinson on board at the beginning, but as far as I know he did artwork on
the box only. I think it's part of Sigil's plan to be a true third
generation MMORPG, to have quality right from the start. The smart designers
these days know that they aren't competing with what EQ was at release,
they're competing with what EQ is today. And what EQ is today is quite
impressive, by any standards.

    Furor of FoH was invited over to Sigil to take a look at what they were
doing a while back. His impressions are here:
