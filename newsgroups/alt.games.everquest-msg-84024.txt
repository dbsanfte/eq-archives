I was wondering why they didn't do something like that the other day, and
came up with a couple of reasons.

1. Perhaps they have an agreement with the publisher not to.  Selling the
key directly means bypassing the game publisher, so it's in the publisher's
interest to have something like that in their contract.

2. How much would you be willing to pay for a key online, and how many
people would be willing to buy them?  $10?  You can get everthing but Luclin
for that already, and in another year, I predict that you'll be able to buy
a 2-CD set containing all 4 titles for the same $10.  

Given that you can get the CDs in the store for $10, the price for the keys
online would have to be lower, otherwise there would be no point in doing
it.

The problem is that the demand is probably too low for them to make any
money selling the keys online for less than $10.  Website maintenance,
merchant account, service, and support cost money.

3. (This is probably the biggest reason) People have already proven that
they'll buy the game at the store if they need an additional account.
