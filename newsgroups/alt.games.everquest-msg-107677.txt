Another thread on the tiny percentage of the posting population in a.g.e
got me wondering.... how many people do we have here that sweated it out
all the way to sixty?  I know we have at least one warlord (Ben) and Jim
is a 60 Monk, and Arolpin is a Soprano (or whateverthefuck a 60 bard
is). But how many others do we have?

I recall several others that are close. e.g. Biz is closing in on 60 as
a druid (58?) and a couple other high fifties.  Just curious.  Some of
the best advice I've gotten on various warrior and wizard and necro
boards has been from those that go all the way, be it in Uberguilds or
unguilded or small guilds, but they see it all and find a way to get xp
through all the levels. I'm a meager 55 myself, but who else here has
"won the game"?

(Note: Not a dick waving contest. Just curious what percentage of our
posters have done it.)
