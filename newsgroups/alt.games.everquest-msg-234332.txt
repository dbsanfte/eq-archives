Wizards have snare, runners are not a problem. Wizards have rune spells
so a mob beating on them for a few swings is no big deal while the other
wizards re-root the mob.

6 enchanters would have 6 animation pets or a couple charmed pets.
DPS would not be a problem. Enchanter animation pets while weak on defence
are strong on offence, and if one dies you just summon another one while
the other 5 pets keep the mob busy.

LOL Necros have snare, fear, mez, and root for CC. Plus the ultimate
get out of jail free card Feign Death. If I was a mob and saw a darkness
spell go off on me I'd start writing my will.

Mages have zip for CC but with 6 you could pet-off-tank a few
adds while all the mages quick burn down one target.

?!?!?! Wha? Great DoTs and good nukes how can you have bad DPS?

All shammies have for CC is root. The pets are nice but their
Real DPS come from their excellent DoTs. A slowed mob
with 12 shaman DoTs and 6 dogs on it would die fast.

The main bad thing with 6 same class group is not really when things
go bad because with any decent exp camp, once you get the technique
down you can grind all day long with out issue and danger.

The main drawback would be downtime! 6 warriors or 6 rogues would
have huge downtime with no healing. The efficiency would suck.
6 monks wouldn't be much better but at least they have self healing.

Basically if you have a mana bar you can do it easily, simply because
mana comes back much faster than HP.
