Yes, that isle bug crept into a recent build, I heard a few people shouting 
that they couldn't get out. Was a few patches ago and no more shouts since 
I've been on the Isle so I'm guessing it's been fixed.

That's what SOE gets for these late changes to the game, including the Isle, 
it's not surprising that there are still bugs there. I don't know about a 
"ton" but there are some. I run through half a dozen new chars on the Isle 
every day in my testing and I've not encountered any other showstoppers 
besides the get-off-the-isle one, most that I'm encountering are quest or 
tradeskill related annoyances. I think they need to make these a high 
priority since they're the first thing new players will see ...

Good, keep /bug'ging them. This is the time.

Yes, the quest system and its integration with the game world is one of the 
strongest points of the game. More and more dropped quest objects are 
discovered every day, and even locations and static objects can produce 
quests. It's fun to crawl deep into a dungeon like Stormhold and discover 
hidden rooms with NPC quest givers and then discover that that statue next 
to the NPC, or that book over there on the table, is itself a quest object. 
Makes the whole world come alive and become more engaging and interesting. 
The voiceovers add to this in cool ways. A comment by an NPC as you walk 
past might suggest the presence of a nearby quest object, even if you didn't 
choose to interact with the NPC on your own.

Yep, this will be a classic different-strokes-for-different-folks set of 
choices. Some folks will prefer the simplicity of the WoW model and its 
faster leveling and gorgeous Disneyesque look. I'm not really looking for 
PvP this time around (particularly not with the bnet crowd, but not even 
with the Zek crowd), but if you want PvP then WoW is your only choice 
between these two. Although I don't find it as pretty or as bug-free and 
ready for launch, my preference remains with the pace and the content of 
EQ2. If they can get their act together in these last few days before launch 
and pull this off, I think I'll be happy here for a good while. If not, well 
... save me a place in your group. I figure by the time WoW appears on the 
shelves, I'll know. ;-)
