For obvious reasons, I am anxious to get my Meditation skills up - however,
sitting around is quite boring.
My question is this... if I sit down, start MEDDING and just leave my
computer up for a few hours, will my meditation skill continue to increase
periodically or do you have to actually be recharging mana to build your MED
skill?
Just wondering.  Surely someone else has tried this....
