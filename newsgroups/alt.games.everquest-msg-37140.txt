At level 23 or so, I stood at one of the docks, waiting for the damned boat,
casting True North until my mana pool was empty, twice, I didn't get a
single increase in Divination, which is still not maxed out.  After that I
gave up, and figured that the ones I use will increase, the ones I don't
won't.
