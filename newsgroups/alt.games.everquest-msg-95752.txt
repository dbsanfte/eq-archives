Another add on to the above tips.
Don't confuse AMOUNT of wisdom to EFFECTIVE USE of wisdom.

Other than quad kiting and playing cleric for a group I have run into very
few situations where I need all my mana. In fact If I need to use it all on
one mob that mob better be tremendous exp or loot. At level 35 I have
quadded to collect silks and greyhopper hides. greens to practice and low
blues for more practice. I then quadded blues but near as I can figure a
combo of rotting and porcing works better. Will I quad again. yep. Just for
the variety of play.
There will always be proponents of maxing out the "best" toon to play but
best is very subjective. Is best mana pool ? is it looks ? is it plat in the
bank ? Is the number of zones you have fought in ?
Just remember others advice is only an opinion, as is this. So take it with
a grain of salt and make your own fun.
