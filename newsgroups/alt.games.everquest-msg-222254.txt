| What do you *do* for tradeskill items in a pickup group?  Roll on every
one?

tradeskill or
| another.

An easy way to deal with the tradeskill items (not common tradeskill gems)
is to roll and pick. If there's 6 of them then it's an easy split, if there
8 of them everyone gets one and the top two rolls get the other two, etc
etc.

Giving preference to someone in a pickup group for tradeskill items seems
very silly to me. Giving items to people in a pickup group on a NBG basis
has been a slippery slope since over time we've seen that abused by
dishonorable people.
