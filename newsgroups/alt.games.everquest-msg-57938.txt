Well yes, dying or zoning avoids a faction hit that would come later.
Weird how that happens isn't it... I mean its pretty obvious you are
not around to take the hit or get aggro (which is exactly the reason
why you reload into the zone even when you die in the same zone, and
why they changed the interzone succor spells to do the same thing) ?
;)

Here is the thing though, just don't be in the zone to throw the buff
on someone anyway. If you are you are going to take a POG factions hit
sometime and if you are concerned you obviously don't want to do so.
If anyone in your guild ever calls you out on that just say "Okay,
lets go and destroy all of neriak where you live and shop and buy
coffins and stuff and if you don't want to because of that I'll say
you are a bad guildmember."
