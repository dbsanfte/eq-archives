Well, my only advice about twinking (which I imagine some people will
agree with) is to at least wait till you reach level 6 before you
REALLY twink the hell out of your character (maybe lightly twink your
character at the beginning) so all your nice gear doesn't go poof if
you die and can't get to your corpse in 30 minutes.
