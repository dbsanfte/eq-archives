Check out what misuse and abuse mean.  The words have entirely different
levels of meanings.  If one is neither better or worse, tell me which has
the greater impact and which implies greater misconduct:

"The abuse of  Nanking" or "The rape of Nanking"
"Misuse and plunder" or "Rape and plunder"
"You're abusing the wildlife sancuary" or "You're raping the wildlife
sancuary"
"She was misused" or "She was raped"

If you believe that both can mean the same because neither one is better or
worse...oh well...but I would really love to be in the same room with you
with, say, a rape counselor, when you tell them that. (And no I'm not
relegating rape to sexual rape...it just seems victims of that would
probably react more violently than environmentalists...but then again, some
of them get mightily perterbed about that.)
