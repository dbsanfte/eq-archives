Oy vey..I took a week off from touching my 'work' computer (for html editing,
website designing, and reading this ng ^_~). After going through the week's
posts I missed, all I can say is wow. Very entertaining. I leave for a week and
the trolls come out of the woodwork!
On the upside, last night I held my second (and very successful) monthly PvP
tourney on Bristlebane, but we had some problems that I'd like to get some
opinions on.

As with any type of organized tournement, there has to be rules. One of our
rules bars being invised in any form after 60 seconds into the match. These
aren't one on one matches, all classes of certain level groups jump into the
ring and start killing.  I've had a LOT of complaints about this rule,
especially from casters and rogues.
If I allow invis, each match could take exorbitant amounts of time due to
casters medding while invis, rogues binding wounds and recovering hps, etc,
etc. Each possible avenue I've tried with this road ends with some kind of
loophole. If there are any other possibilities you can think of, I'd love to
hear them. I'm at my wits end!
My second problem is with the PvP area. Our first tournement was at the FP
arena, but many people couldn't come because they are KoS. This one was held at
the Rathe Arena, but we tend to have many spectators, and since there is no
Non-pvp part of the arena with a good view of the ring, I just had to trust
that the spectators wouldn't cast spells on the particpants, or punch the guy
standing next to them. It seems my only good option is the arena on the moon
(shadowhaven or bazaar, can't remember which zone exactly)..but not everyone
has Luclin. Should I just say screw those without SoL, or are there other
options?
If you'd like to check out the rules to get a better idea what I'm getting at,
our website is http://home.mastersites.com/pvp

Any help or ideas at all would be very appreciated! Thanks guys =)
