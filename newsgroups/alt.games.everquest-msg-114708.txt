There are alot of options for a L13 pally actually.
First and foremost, solo'ing isn't one of them. There are only a few places
where a pally can solo effectively, so grouping is going to be your avenue
of choice for levelling. Luckily, there are plenty of places you can go for
groups. Bandit camp in WC, Befallen in WC, NRO hunting orcs and/or bandits,
Oasis hunting crocs. You might want to try High Keep pass, just when you
zone in from Kith. Usually seems to be one or two groups there milling about
the entrance hunting orcs.
Bottom line, grouping is a way of life for us pallies. Get used to it. You
can do the solo thing, but it is going to take you alot longer to advance.
Besides, us pallies were made for helping others, why not group? Hope that
helps. Good luck to you.
