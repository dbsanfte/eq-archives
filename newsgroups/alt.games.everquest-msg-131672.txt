 I haven't seen any mention of this yet, but over on Test the 10%
healing penalty for non-cleric classes has been removed. Clerics still
enjoy a 5% bonus.

 At the moment this is carrying over to spells on items such as
Invigorate on Velious BPs, leading to 100pt heals instead of 90. It
would be nice if they left that like that but who knows. They may figure
that extra 10 pts is unbalancing!
