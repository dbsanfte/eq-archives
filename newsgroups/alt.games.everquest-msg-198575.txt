Its good for a MASSIVE.M.R.P.G You can't have a game with 10,000
Luke Skywalkers.

People like to do trade skills, myself as well. EQtraders.com is a very
popular EQ web site.

If all you have is hack and slash or shoot and laser slash then
you get a boring game real quick. Quests, trades, etc. help to flesh
out the world and add depth to the adventures you can have.

You want examples in star wars? Luke was pretty good at fixing
droids? Was it a skill? He must have learned it right?
