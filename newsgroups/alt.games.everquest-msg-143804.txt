POTC is the single target version of POTG, doesn't stack. Also, both
don't stack with Heroism, Heroic Bonds, BOA or Aego (cleric spells) which
generally means you want to get any cleric you group with to symbol
you if you taking serious damage is a possibility; Aego will chop out
your POTx mana regen.  At the same time, clerics and some other
classes will prefer Aego and not your POTx, which is where you may
find POTC more useful than POTG; figure out if you are really getting
your mana's worth out of POTG based on how many people want it.

KEI stacks with all the things you list, it conflicts only with the clarity
line and a necro self only line (lich)

I don't think the masks stack with each other, and you listed Mask
of the Hunter twice anyway... it certainly won't stack with itself.  They
DO stack with KEI and POTx though.

Baroness is the "I got 6 general AA" title, Venerable is the "I got
12 priest archetype AA" title, and Elder is the "I got waaaay too
many druid specific AA" title

I'm sure there are several, but have no experience with this.  You
have track, look for zones with mobs that are blue for you, then
do sense animals!

Not as helpful as I'd like to be, but that never stopped me trying
