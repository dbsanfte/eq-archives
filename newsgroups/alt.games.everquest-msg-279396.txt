Hi there!  I guess my situation is from the other side.  I generally don't
advertise that I am willing to buff.  I have done that before, but the crowd
that amasses makes it too confusing to keep track, and empties my mana with
many standing around waiting--then I feel compelled to stay until everyone
has the buff.  This could take a long time.  I usually answer people's /ooc
requests.  This way it's a lot easier to control the flow of people seeking
me out and I can stop whenever I like.

As far as people sending me tells, I never minded that in the least.  It's
always easy to say no, for whatever reason, and it's also great fun to go
back and forth with an irate requester/demander when he insists that because
I'm a cleric, it's my duty to buff/rez people.

Neither of these scenarios hardly happen anymore since I switched to eq2.
Once in a blue moon I'll get on eq1 for nostalgic reasons and maybe buff a
little or extend a rez.  Then I might go off to try to obtain that elusive
last pearlesent shard that I need to complete the set of four for my epic
ONE.  Just for fun I'll pick a fight with a gollum guarding the entrance to
the city in the Overthere.  While meleeing I'll start casting heals and
wonder why I'm not gaining health, then realize I never targetted myself
during the combat--oh the little subtleties between the game versions...8-/
