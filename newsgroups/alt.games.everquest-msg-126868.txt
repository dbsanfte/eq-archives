OK, so you mean to tell me you type 552 words a minute?  That might
explain a lot.  (Standard typing speed tests count any five letters or
spaces as a word, there are 229 characters and spaces in that phrase,
which is 46 words, and assuming that it took you 5 seconds, you can do
12 times that every minute.)  Of course you can now type faster than
the world's fastest typist, so maybe we deserve your scorn.

Now me, it took 32 seconds to type that, which means I type at least
twice as fast as I did when I took typing many years ago.  I think
being able to type over 60 words a minute is pretty damn good, and
probably faster than the majority of adults.
