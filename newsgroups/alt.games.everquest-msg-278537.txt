I am currently a Final Fantasy XI player, and am considering trying out 
Everquest II.

I really like Final Fantasy XI, with my biggest complaint being the 
inability to explore without getting killed; unless of course you have 
spent hundreds of hours leveling your character to such a height, that most 
monsters won't kill you, or try to, on-sight.

I understand that Everquest II is more conducive to exploring and soloing, 
if you so choose.

Final Fantasy XI is my first foray into RPC games, and it's online too.  I 
came from an adventure background, primarily the Myst series, Zork, et al.

I would be interested in any comments, positive or negative, before I 
purchase the game and service.

Thank you for you time.
Robert
