LMAO-then we need to add:
Identify Ordinary Object-Identifies all ordinary objects
Enchant Useless Object-Enchants any useless object create an enchanted
useless object
Mass Pull-Causes all MOBS in zone to aggro-saves time or use it when you
don't have a tank around to pull
Nuke Your Friends-Nukes your friends, sparing the MOB-amuse your friends and
groupmates
Dillusion-causes you to think you are invisible when in fact you are not
