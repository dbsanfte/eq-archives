I agree with you on that there are some interesting places and I try and
continue to explore everything thing I can. I will also agree that after
50 one is nearing the end of his story, but there "is" supposed to be
and end to the story. Unless you not making one. Diluting the characters
dilutes the story to the point there isn't even one. I find it great to
run into friends that I grew up with in Freeport in other parts of the
world 20 levels later. Of course there are some that aren't interested
in their own story and play EQ in it's intended and full manner. 
I just intend on playing out my story to it's end and moving on. I don't
believe in staying in a game forever only to stagnate and criticize the
game and then it's people.
