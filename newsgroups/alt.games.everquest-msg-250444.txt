And evidently THEY REALLY SUCK AT IT. The luclin models are pretty
darn crappy, especially when you take into account all the extra
graphical overhead they have.

The bad thing is, it sounds like these models, and other graphical
updates, won't be in until EQ2 and WOW are already out. That is a bit
late. It really doesn't matter how great they look, since they just
won't work well unless they overhaul the entire game and all zone art.
they will just make EQ into an even bigger hodge podge, while likely
fragmenting cosmetic appearences from player to player EVEN MORE. 

Currently we have 3 radically different looks possible for some
characters, based on the customer viewing them. One customer might
have luclin models enabled so they see them one way. Another customer
might only have old models with regular old textures, they see them
another. Yet another customer may have all old models, but all velious
textures also on (you can display velious textures with luclin models,
they are not made for them.) So that is already 3 different possible
views, of a character type wearing a velious armor look.

Now, its very likely that in the future we will still have those 3
choices AND this new one. No one will have any idea in heck how their
character looks to anyone.
