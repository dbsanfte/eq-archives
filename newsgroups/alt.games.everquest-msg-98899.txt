I'm almost certain that has nothing to do with his problem, for I've
seen the same thing with an external ISDN modem.  In certain zones,
there have been certain areas that had high packet loss.  For example,
in Cabilis at the Shaman guild, I would get >50% packet loss if I was
near the trainer, around 10% packet loss in the guild but not near the
trainer, and no packet loss outside the building.

In Rivervale, standing near the POD I'd get high packet loss.  Standing
at the entrance to the tunnel to Misty Thicket, no packet loss.  The
packet loss would come and go in exact match to my movement between
those spots.  To make sure that I wasn't accidently moving in time to
some cycle of packet loss, I went so far as to get a stopwatch and a
d20, and I'd roll the d20, and multiply by 3, to get a random interval
from 3 seconds to 1 minute, and use the stopwatch to measure an interval
of that length, before moving between the POD and the tunnel.  I did
this a dozen times, and the packet loss always shot up right as I
approached the POD, and went back to normal as soon as I moved away.
