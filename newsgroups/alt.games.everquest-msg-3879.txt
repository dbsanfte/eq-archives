Now that I have my DSL connection, my Everquest games are a bit more
fun and fast.  I am considering getting a wireless network using
802.11b in my home for networking for gameplay to make it a bit more
mobile.  Currently I am using a 10ms wired network set up and things
are working fine.

I am wondering if anyone has experience using a wireless setup to play
EQ.  I am considering the Linksys Wireless Access Point/Router combo,
or the SMC Wireless Barriacade (both using 802.11b or the new term
WiFi).

I am a bit nervous regarding lag using wireless vs. wire.

Hoping someone has had some experience with this and I hope it works
well with EQ.

Thanks
