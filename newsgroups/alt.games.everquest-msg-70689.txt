Throughout your Rogues life your priorities will be:
AC
HPs
Weapons
Resists

I would say your best initial investment would be:
2x 6AC/65HP rings.
1x Fast Piercing 1x Fast 1HS weapons (speed is more important than
high damage sub-lvl20 due to damage caps)
The best AC armor you can afford. (Blackened Alloy has AC similar to
Bronze, is ROG wearable, and looks black when worn.)
