I can't believe what a little AI will do. The Library used to be a
favorite place of mine, half decent loot, and good mobs. Mostly
casters, and not too tough. Good XP grinding.

Now they are awesome foes. Enchanters using tash and suffocate,
punching for decent damage, and high dodges. Adds are now deadly. One
member was charmed and sent after the other members. We TPed out, but
without our charmed member. Three deaths on that two from the charmed
and one after the charmed player was released.

I better spawn that angry librarian and get a key for three now! I
better go with a FULL party. I have seen a 55 shaman go down there
under a train before the AI change, I shudder to think what would
happen now!

I was thinking yeah right, that caster AI can't be that different. I
assure you, it is good. Consider this a complement for the programming
team! Good job guys!
