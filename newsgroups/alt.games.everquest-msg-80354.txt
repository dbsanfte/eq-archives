In the future, if you lose your body, here's what you do -

/who bard

look for one that is level 4 or up and give them a tell asking them
if they have a moment to help you find your body.  When I played my
bard I always had time to do this, as I know how much of a pain it 
can be to lose your body.

If there are no bards, try any necro (level 1 and up) or shadow knight
(level 9 and up).
