Kite in EW - especially when you get your 2nd Chant. You should be able to
mini-swarm kite right now. Just remember to con your mobs carefully and
learn which are charmable and which aren't (you're up against the top end of
the charm you have, and you don't get another until 39).

DSP is ok, but you'll have lots more problems with adds (much harder to see
potential adds because of the hills and the wolfies that like to hide behind
rocks).
