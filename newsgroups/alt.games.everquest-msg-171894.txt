Instrument twisting is a pain, isn't it?  I can switch between two instruments fairly easily, but
to do it while swarm kiting requires approximately 3 hands - one for steering, one for song
twisting and one for instrument twisting.  So when I do need to twist instruments, to say twist
in my flute so that I can break charm with Invis, I move my mouse to the left side of my
keyboard and keep the cursor on the secondary slot holding the flute with the drum equipped.
When I need to switch instruments, I move my song twisting hand over and click the left
button on the mouse once to swap instruments then go back to twisting.

The only problem is that I'm not used to mousing with my left hand and sometimes I accidentally
move the mouse off the secondary slot position making it impossible to switch the instruments.
I need to get a cradle to put the mouse in where it can't move :)

I have also thought about making a foot pedal that does the same thing as click the left mouse button.
That way I could switch instruments without needing a third hand, or even touch the mouse, for
that matter.
