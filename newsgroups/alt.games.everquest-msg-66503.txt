   Were the knight classes ever promised a "free ultimate steed"?  I don't
remember reading this on Verant's Luclin hyping web site.  I do recall a few
"subject to change" lists of the "Luclin alternate advancement skills" which
included Holy and Unholy Steed, which I presume is what you're referring to
with the "level through 51 six times" spiel.  If your figures are correct
and the amount of experience you have to gain to achieve that skill is
actually equivalent to leveling through those post-50 levels several times,
that is fairly excessive, especially since it's my understanding that the
bridles are NO DROP... which means even if you are a paladin or shadow
knight who REALLY wants a horse, you're going to be level 51+ for a long
time before you get one, unless you shell out a lot of dough to get one
sooner... and when you finally get your "ultimate" steed, you can't even
sell you old one.  That sucks.
