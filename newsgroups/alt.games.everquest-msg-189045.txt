Fair enough.  I think his eyes are starting to open, though.  It's like
internationalism takes the worst parts of parlimentary bearucracy and
amplifies them.  Add into that, regional hatred, pork on an international
scale, and the pettiness of tin-pot dictators, and we get a body that is
useless to acomplish or decide anything at all.  I think Blair is beginning
to see that.  Now, I hope he stops selling y'all to Brussels.
