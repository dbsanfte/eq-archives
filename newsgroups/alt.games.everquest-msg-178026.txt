Has anybody else been having strange and annoying lockups since the
last patch?

Keeps happening to me, I *THINK*, when people zone in.  Not all of the
time, but enough to be a PITA.

Nobody else in my guild seems to be having the problem, so I might
have to come to terms with the fact that it's just my machine.
