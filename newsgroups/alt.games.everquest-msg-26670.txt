You know the funny thing? I just dont care if I die any more. It
doesnt happen that often and when it does I almost invariably get
a res eventually - I just cant remember the last time I didn't. And
I have so much more *fun* doing dangerous things, and I enjoy the
game so much more doing things like screaming "those who can get
out, do it! I'll tank it!" and finding myself standing there tanking
the fifth black reaver pop as the train of phantoms descends on me
and the lone druid who's decide to stay behind and try to heal me
;)

(actually in that case nearly everybody made it to the zoneline...
except the cleric, who managed to get summoned back just as I finally
bought it. Doh. ;-) )

Its like, I lose a little blue but I get so much more entertainment
from it ;)

Of course, every so often I do succumb and go to Seb and quietly
grind in safety when I want to actually *level*....
