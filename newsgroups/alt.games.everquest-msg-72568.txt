Max your int or get it as high as possible, after that get as much HP/Mana
gear as possible.  the HP gear really helps out at the low levels... in fact
its more important than your int at that point (as is mana gear) but its
good to have yout int maxed sooner rather than later.

As Ben mention Jboots/Tboots are the ultimate piece of twink equipment for a
wizard.  Having them early on will more than likely cut the time taken to
get to 50 in half.  Taking into account number of deaths saved by being able
to outrun mobs, aswell as giving you the ability to Quad kite very early on.
So if there is one thing you should get....make it Jboots/Tboots.
