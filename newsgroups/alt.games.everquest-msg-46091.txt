Congratulations I think that the speed and publicity of your leveling
has been great.
VI can search your old posts to get a nice potted history of a player
from 0 to 50.

The bad news is that by my calculation you are at best 54% of the way to
60 in terms of number of xp giving mobs you need to kill.

Remember also that 51 is 2.23 times longer than 50 was to get.
And that 51-52 is 4% worse again !
50-51 is 10% worse than 45 was.

Stay happy you have a while to X Vox yet :-P

Jim
