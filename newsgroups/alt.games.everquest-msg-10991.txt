i like the creativity of that one.  I remember one morning I was playing
with a few in the lake of ill omen, and some enchanter shouted

"I am your crack whore I got what you need."

needless to say, (at least on my betox i see lots of female who play in
mornings) this person got about a million shouts back at the line and when
he did it again a gm appeared in the zone.

we never did see him again.

and to rest the minds of the thread contributors that was one of the more
mild shouts he did ).
