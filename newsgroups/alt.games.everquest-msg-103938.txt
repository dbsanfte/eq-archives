    IV must be easy, judging by the guilds that have killed her on my
server. I just wish we could get some time with her so we could experiment
with spawning Amen'Ra. There's something more there, I'm sure of it....

    Nathyn isn't worth killing. One drop, a bad faction hit, and a chance at
spells? Blech. If you want spells, go after Grieg. You'll get useful
quest-related drops (wink, wink, nudge, nudge), he drops four spells, his
two item drops are usually of very high quality, and the fight itself is
fairly exciting and simple once you get your positioning down. I also like
killing the necromancer in our guild that has the key to make a storage
corpse after every fight- about the only way I'm killing a necro in a duel.

    I have yet to see how many spells Rumblecrush drops, but I've just asked
our guild to add him to our list of Targets We Kill. Only three drops that
are outright bad, and five or six drops that are top-notch. The toughest
part of the fight looks to be getting folks out to him to fight him. Every
trip to Umbral it seems someone dies out in ME, and grinding through Umbral
itself can be tedious.
