Several people have commented on this recently and it matches my own
experience (Shaman 53). I had originally thought that I was just hitting
some new plateau and that it was getting progressively harder to gain enough
experience to level, but enough people have commented on this lately that I
suspect SOE may have tweaked some tables in order to dispel the sense that
it's "too easy to level".

By the way, if LDoN does become an option for you at some point, take it if
at all possible. There are many things I like about LDoN, but one of the
main advantages is that the timed mission structure of these private,
group-specific dungeon outings diverts your attention away from the
experience bar while you focus on completing the mission objective. Time and
experience just fly by!
