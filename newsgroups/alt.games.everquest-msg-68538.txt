Are you sure you aren't confusing EQW with that earlier "run EQ in a
window" hack whose name I forget?  I seem to recall you trying that
other one, and having problems.  EQW came out quite a bit later.

I'll definitely be giving EQW a try, since last night I had EQ hang
once while zoning.  With EQW, I'll be able to switch out and kill the
process, rather than having to reboot the machine, if it happens
again.
