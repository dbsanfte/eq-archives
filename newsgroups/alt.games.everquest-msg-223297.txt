a) When he says lower level, he means lower from a strictly floating point
point of view... -70 is lower than -40. The effect however is actually
stronger.

b) Except in special circumstances (Rallos Zek, Tallon/Vallon/Sullon Zek and
different teams, dueling, an arena, or both turned in 'the book'), players
may not cast detrimental spells on other players. Except for Sentinel of
course.
