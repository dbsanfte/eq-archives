The bone talisman is secondary only?  That sucks!  I thought it could go in
primary.  I've got the tiger skin, just need the charm.

I'm on Tholuxe Paells.

I'm trying to do the stein of moggok now but I have sucky faction with clurg
and as of the last patch Jarlen Meadowgreen, the bread quest centaur, has
gone awol.  He hasn't been at his post since the servers came back up.  I
guess that's on hold now.

Have a good one,

Lewis
