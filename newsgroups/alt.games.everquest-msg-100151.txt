Go to Everlore and then the files page under other links. Download EQ Tools
by Nihasa into your Everquest directory and unzip it.

http://www.everlore.com/

http://www.everlore.com/lorefiles/default.asp


Once you unzip the file you run it by double clicking the icon from the
windows explorer menu. The first time you run it you need to point it to
your EQclient ini. file (it will be listed).

The program will enable you to change your text colors, menu background
colors and many other options with just a click of the mouse.

It works great and works with all the expansions.
