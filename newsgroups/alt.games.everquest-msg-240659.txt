The best way is to find a nice higher level mellee (a good group will
do also) who is killing blues or higher to you and ask them if you can
beat up on their mobs to get exp.  When they engage you stand behind
the mob and punch away ... you will skillup quite quickly doing this.

This same method is good for other skillups too.
