I think the point people were trying to make is that you can park in the 
newb zone, leave one of those little pecking-bird thingies hitting your 
auto-attack key, go away for an evening, and come back to a level 10 
character.  The early levels go -so- damned fast in EQ right now, that it's 
unfathomable that you could be playing...really playing...and only be level 
13 after two and a half years.  It's not a matter of you sucking; one can 
only assume that you've either started your character over a bunch of 
times, or that you happily pay Sony $13/mo to never log in, because the 
game just really isn't a game of skill at that level.
