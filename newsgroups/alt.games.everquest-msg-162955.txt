Wow, I'm so glad to see such a fine group of outstanding law-abiders. It's a
nice feeling to know I am surrounded by people who never go 1 mile per hour
over the speed limit, never photocopy a page or two out of a copyrighted
book/magazine, and never EVER download music/video/etc. with <insert name of
P2P file sharing protocol here>. Thanks so much, officers of the Morals
Police. I feel safe enough to go to sleep now, with you on the case.
