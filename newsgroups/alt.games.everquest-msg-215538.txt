I've not made any lists as such, but I do occaisionally put people on my
ignore list.  These people get no rez, no buffs, no help, but not because I
remember what they did and am punishing them, rather, I can't hear them, and
if on rare occaision, I do become aware of their pleas (because someone tells
me about it) I explain that for some reason they are on ignore so I'm going to
continue ignoring them.

This has almost exactly zero effect on their play, as far as I can tell,
perhaps five times in several years of play I've been aware of someone on my
ignore list wanting something from me, and I'm hardly unique, there are surely
lots of other clerics about who've never heard of the git, and for that
matter, a dry loot isn't really all that big a deal.

Playing a number of other classes, I find even less likelyhood that anyone
would notice in the slightest that I have them on ignore.  "No SoW for you
from my shaman?  Oooh, you are in pain now.  No summoned gear from my mage?
Do you have any idea how few people ask for any summons at all?  Perhaps a few
stacks of arrows or bandages, nothing anyone is really going to miss.  No
clarity from my chanter?  The bloody buff will probably wear off before you
get to your camp spot anyway.  No... hmm, there really isn't a thing a bard
can do for you, is there?  Sure won't miss getting a 2 minute selos!

I do find that most bleeding gits seem to vanish from the game soon enough,
the number of people that are on that ignore list that show up on a /who all
are quite small.  There was at least one person I actively avoided, however,
who stayed with the game, hit 60 and later 65 well before me, and seemed to
function quite happily despite the despite of at least half the people I
talked with whenever his name came up.

Doesn't really matter to me much, though, since I never group with him or do
him any favors, just on general principle, and don't really need to see him
suffer one way or the other as long as it doesn't have anything to do with me.
