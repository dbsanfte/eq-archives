52 isn't turning out much better because it's worse. :-)

Level	XP for level (in million)
		Hell factor
44	 7.4	1.3
45	16.8	1.4
46	 8.7	1.4
47	 9.1	1.4
48	 9.5	1.4
49	 9.9	1.4
50	10.3	1.4
51	24.0	1.5
52	26.0	1.6
53	28.1	1.7
54	46.1	1.9
55	50.2	2.1
56	54.5	2.3
57	59.1	2.5
58	63.8	2.7
59	89.3	3.0
60	53.5	3.1

(Yes, these numbers are different from the ones I used in an earlier
post in this thread...had the wrong table there).

The total XP needed to reach then end of level N is 1000 H N^3, where
H is the hell factor.  The reason the traditional hell levels are so
hellish is that they are levels where the hell factor changes.  The
effect of this is to make the level curve steaper, and the change is
*retroactive*.  That is, at 45, not only do you have to make the XP
for 45 on the new curve, you have to make up all the extra XP that you
would have needed 1-44 if they had been on the new curve.

Notice that at 51, the hell factor starts to go up every level.  In
that sense, every level over 50 is a hell level.  However, only 59 is
like traditional hell levels in that it is harder than the level that
follows.

So, it's not clear what levels after 50 should actually be called hell
levels.  51, 54, and 59 have that "this is way worse than the previous
level" kind of hell.  Only 59 is harder than the following level.
However, they all have an increased hell factor, so involve making up
retroactively for the earlier levels.
