I think that once you start to make fun of someone's nickname, you have lost
the argument.

But you were right in  your assessment of my motives.  Does anyone want to
trade for my level 5 DE cleric?  He has average gear for someone his level
and a great in-game reputation.  There is also a level 2 Halfling druid on
that account as a bonus.
