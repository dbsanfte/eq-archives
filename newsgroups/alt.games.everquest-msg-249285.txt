I think most of the values here are still accurate:

	http://www.rpgexpert.com/1349.html

I once ran that page through a program to compute which items gave the
best tribute-to-plat ratio, i.e., which items might I be able to buy --
or might choose not to sell -- in order to turn them in for tribute.
Found various items with 10-to-1 or better ratios, don't remember them
now because I found one item that works great, at least at my current
character levels: the much-maligned crabs and tuna from Abysmal Sea and
Natimbi.

Those crabs/tuna used to sell for major plat, like about half a plat
per pound.  People were lined up all along the docks fishing.  Then SOE
nerfed the prices so vendors now pay only 1 copper per pound, and there
was much bitching and whining. :)  But the tribute values are still
there -- and I think that may even be intentional by SOE.  So anyone
who owns GoD can go to Abysmal Sea and fish, and probably (depending on
Fishing skill, which is level-capped) catch several hundred pounds of
seafood per hour, which you can then turn in for about 1/2 tribute per
pound.  Or if you train up your Baking skill even a little (which you
can do for free on the boat), you can convert all the crab/tuna to
one-pound chunks, which are worth one tribute each.

I'm sure high level characters can make plat faster than this, but at
low to medium levels this is a great way to generate tribute.  My monk's
been running around with 2-4 extra HP regen for a while now and it's
really handy!
