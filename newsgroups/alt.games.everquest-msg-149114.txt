I chuckle at low level player groups (such as in Crushbone) who
run away from some risky battles.  The recovery time is probably
longer than just dying and doing a CR.  The exp loss is minimal,
a few mobs probably cover it.  May as well just stay in the fight
and see how it goes.  Might even learn something!  But no, they
scatter like frightened squirrels.  Kinda funny.  :)
