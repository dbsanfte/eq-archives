Rogue epic as well.  It's possible to pickpocket the upper/lower
halves of the notes from Kaladim/Neriak in your low 30's, level 39
if you want to wait for 200 PP skill.

However you can't get the NPC (Stanos) to put the two halves
together until you ding 50.  And that's the first "real" part of the
quest.
