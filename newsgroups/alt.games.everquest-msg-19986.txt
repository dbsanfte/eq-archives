   My husband plays a troll.  Right now my main main is
the wood elf ranger, though I do play the warrior also.  
Regardless of what I play, people give us funny looks 
when we group together.  I really need to work on my 
cleric more, so that we can spend more time running 
around.  I call him an ogre to annoy him, he calls me
a dwarf.
