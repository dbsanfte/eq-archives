And just where do you get this, or are you making even more arrogant
assumptions with no basis whatsoever in-game to support it? They're no
differently represented than any of the races' "camps" outside the
cities.

Plus, what about the base in Kunark that's full of dark elves?

So, just having rangers qualifies them as not being "homebodies"?
Incidently, I don't see any more in-game representations of shows of
wood elf force outside of a few camps here and there than I do dark
elves, etc.

There's Firiona Vie, but, guess what? There's lots of Halflings there,
too... I see no more evidence that halflings are stay at home types
than I do to support the same for ANY race.

Says you... They didn't seem to mind much the large number of camps
that appeared all over West Commons for a while, did they?
