Well, unlike some in this newsgroup, I'm not going to sit here and tell you
that you have no idea what you've experienced, since that would be the
height of arrogance.  I do find it difficult to believe, though, considering
how prominatly displayed they are.  Granted, it may be due to regional
differences.

Telling your son about condoms and hoping that he mature enough to not have
to worry about it until he's married is kinda like building up a strong army
if you want peace... in other words, it's pretty much manditory and a
serious responsiblity.  Take from that what you will.

I would suggest that, if they can't restrain their desires enough to _not_
have sex, then they, and their relationship isn't all that mature.  I don't
consider giving in to your urges a sign of maturity.

Nice to see you're so open-minded.  Don't let the door hit ya where
evolution split ya.

I got tired of being disgusted with trite partisans like you a long time
ago.  I pitty you for your closed mind.  I pitty you for the fact that you
will never be able to hold a conversation with someone you disagree with,
and still have respect for them.  If I disgust you, then don't bother
responding to me.  Remington and kaev are much more capable of representing
your ideas without being total assholes.  I figure it's the least I can do
for them to not hold a bitter person like you against them.
