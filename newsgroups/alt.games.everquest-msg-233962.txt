And so far, I've had a blast playing the cleric. Each new spell level's been
truly exciting (of course, I'm used to that with a druid as my main, but
still, lol), and I find myself looking forward to playing on firiona vie
again, whereas before, with the pally, when my friends would ask me to play,
I'd come up with excuses not to go on that server. Nothing against pallies
(hell, my bf is a pally, lol), just not really what I consider exciting. :)

I was playing the pally solely for my friends' benefit, not for my own;
playing the cleric is for both myself and for them, so the enjoyment is
there. You're right on the money about that. :)
