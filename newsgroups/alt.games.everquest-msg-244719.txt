Old school term that was started back in the day (early 90's is when I
first heard it).  Generally the underground hackers/pirates folks used
to claim self "l33tn3sz", or aka Eliteness.  Probably became most
popular on usenet, IRC, and old BBS message networks.

Most of the people who use that term now a days, especially on EQ, are
probably just saying it because it looks/sounds funny.

Ironically, the term "woot" also comes from the same era and same
peoples.

Funny seeing all this underground talk becoming so popular in the
mainstream.  We're talking 10+ years of usage, started by people who
were not even looking for attention from the mainstream.
