Last I heard, if you did nearly all of the damage and someone came along 
and finished it off, you would get an appropriate share of the xp, but the 
person who deal the killing blow would get all the infulence reward (CoH 
currency). 

It makes my blood boil to have the last 1% of a mob stolen and have to 
watch as the rescued citizen rushes up to the kill-stealer, telling then 
what a true hero they are and giving them your influence.
