Well, we logged in again tonight (just before the servers went down for patching. sigh)  and
my wife's character was still outrunning mine... by a long shot.  Some of the animations
on her screen were running fast too... like the sky and the snakes on the ground looked
like they were on crack, lol.

Well, I have reported this problem via /bugreport.   Hopefully they read those things, and
that someone else has reported the problem too.
