from what i've heard, alchemy is a class specific skill (i forget which
class) but does that mean that there is no way another class can learn it,
or does it just mean that it is not offered at other class's guilds?  the
reason i ask is because i am a necromancer and would like to make potions,
but i am not sure whether or not i can and i don't want to waste my time
with it unless i am certain it will work for me.
