How do you try to pull them?  At 40, my Necro pulled one at a time using
Dooming Darkness (when they were standing together) and never got an add
...

The way I do it is:

Dooming Darkness
Vampiric Curse if darkness stuck
Wait til skeleton is out of the library
If darkness stuck then
  Panic the Dead
Else
  Pet
  Panic the Dead
  Pet back off
  Vampiric Curse
Eternities Torment
Pet after 50% skelly hp gone

refear, redark as needed

By not letting your pet at him until 50% of the mobs hp are gone you
avoid having your pet steal half your exp.

You will eventually learn about where in the skeleton's panicked run the
fear wears off.  Make sure he is redarked before this happens.  Then you
can let him come at you and drag him back toward the library.  That way
you don't have to chase him halfway across the zone.

Also, Sense the Dead can be useful to target skeletons inside the library
that you don't even see.
