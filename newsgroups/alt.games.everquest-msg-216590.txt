Sorry for double-post reply to the same post...

Here's another statement that shows gross ignorance. You apparently
assume that raid guilds are the only types of guilds out there. There
are plenty of "family guilds" out there who don't put any demands on
your time. They're there for socializing. You can pitch in and help
them if you want to and have the time, and they'll do the same for
you.

The guilds my characters are in are about roleplay. Raiding doesn't
even really come into the picture as a guild event. Sure, we'll round
up help for big fights now and then, but that's not by far a major
theme with us.

If you're not into the demands of a raiding guild, that doesn't mean
ALL guilds will ruin the fun. In fact, for me, RP guilds make the game
even more fun.
