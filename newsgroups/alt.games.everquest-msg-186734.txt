Actually, it worked quite well for me.  I did get a couple of "land shark"
casts, but I just moved closer to the boat entrance.  The froggy that was
the only other passenger on the boat cautioned me to not fall off, which was
rather obvious advice.  I only caught a couple items: One fish, a knife, and
something else I can't remember.  My fishing skill isn't very high, so this
is not surprising.  I got messages about not fishing on dry land when the
boat was "zoning", so to speak, but these periods were brief.

Cheers,
Eric
