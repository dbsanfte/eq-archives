I think I know this boss you're speaking of.   We were completely unprepared
for him, the one time we got him.   He turned our bazaar geared paladin into
a dwarf shaped stain on the ground in about 3 seconds.   He was triple
hitting for over 600, very fast.

Theres aslo a certain Tak dungeon that is just plain evil for Assassinate
missions.   Immediately upon entering, it splits not into two, but four main
passageways.   The boss can pop at the end of any one of the four.   And
while none of them are *too* long...  the chances of you clearing one of
them and having to go back and clear an  entire second one are very high.
I don't think you can pull enough to the entrance area to spawn the boss,
without encountering excessive pull times either.   Or lots of "running
around to the beginning of the next branch time"

On a side note, one of the few rescue missions I've done was in that same
"evil" dungeon.    Easiest adventure I've ever done.    Tracked him from
zone in, had the one wing and the area around him cleared by 20 mintues in,
and killed enough to get him to leave by 40 minutes.
