	That's complete BS. The hate list is 60 people long now, and they
had 28. Once a MOB has been injured he can summon anyone on the hate list.

	Even if it was possible their melee weren't being hit, Ventani
would have summoned people and killed them one at a time. However, it's
not possible that their melee weren't being hit. They were doing their
damage with melee and spells. The former must be in range to attack (and,
thus, get attacked back), and the latter must have LOS, and therefore
be in AE range. Ventani was quite happily whacking away at their melee
during that fight.

	The clerics were under the bridge. This is a valid tactic, IMHO,
even if it is a bit cheesy. They would be summoned if they had sufficient
hate built up and attacked. If enough of them down there had sufficient
hate, then Ventani would have left his platform and run to them to kill
them (which would completely screw up the attempt).

	They used COH on the second attempt because they couldn't keep
aggro with a 5% slow on their tanks from res effects. That's a tactic
(COH, that is, the res effects is cheesy, possibly an exploit). Ventani
would summon their clerics and kill them, and move down to them otherwise.

	We tried the same thing when fighting Tukaarak. We stuck our clerics
underneath the bridge and fought him. We've killed him straight up before,
so we have a valid basis of comparison. Net result: it's easier, but not a
whole lot.

	On our first attempt with that method, our main tank got dispelled
and thrown into the ice lava beneath the bridge. Tukaarak obligingly ran
down and proceeded to attack. On our second attempt with that method,
Tukaarak repeatedly summoned clerics.

	There's also a big drawback to this method: you need LOS to
/target a character. A lot of our healing is done via /assist and tank
orders, so we ended up losing a lot of healing because we couldn't have
clerics outside the group target the main tank to heal.

	Net result: Tukaarak was easier, but only marginally.

	And ST dragons don't have 100k HP, otherwise you could use
Dragon's Bane, and you can't (we tried on all four).

	Brad's just covering his ass. It's been clear for a long time now
that he has no clue how this game works, especially at the high levels.
