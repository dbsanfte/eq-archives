    It is a bit harsh, yes.  But I think it is also appropriate,
especially when dealing with such a well known troll as ETP.  He
apparently gets his jollys by disrupting newsgroups.  If anyone
rises to the bait, then they are helping him do that.  If my news
reader didn't have an option to "ignore thread started by
whomever" feature, then you can bet your can I would KF just
about everyone that responded to ETP.

   It can he tough not to jump in and condemn an especially
outrageous statement.  But know that if you are doing so, you are
doing nothing but jumping through the hoop that the troller has
set up for you.
