EQW isnt a hacking program besides its kinda hard to bring up a mem editor
if you cant alt and tab and you cant hack anything that is server side which
means most things you can however hack display and values so it looks like
you have a billion plat to you but the server stillnows you only got 6pp so
you could do shit like die when your health bar looks full pretty useless
obviously certain thinga are hackable but i'm not gonna give you any hints
or ideas or show you anyway as to how but it can be done
