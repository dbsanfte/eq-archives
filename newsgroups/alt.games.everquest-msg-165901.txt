I've got all my epic drops up to this guy, he seems annoyingly
difficult to spawn.

The one guide I've got suggests he spawns in a spot just past the
OT entrance, and might roam from there to Burning Woods... which
wouldn't be a problem at all, except that he has Place Holders,
which may apparantly be any mob in the zone.

It seems to me the only way to get him to spawn, then, would be
to kill every mob between OT and BW with someone watching the
spawn spot.  Once you get something to spawn on that spot it
would be a relatively simple matter of killing whatever spawns
there repeatedly till you get him.

Another suggested tactic was for a high level bard to use song of
the Highsun to send mobs to their spawn spots.  Again, sounds
like a two man exercise, with the one bard sending every mob in
the area back home, and his confederate watching the spot for the
one mob thats the PH.  Does SOHS use any mana?

Are there any other plans for doing this?  Whats the timer like
on the PH cycle?  Does the PH despawn on its own, so that
settling in for a nice nap near the spawn spot would eventually
pay off?

I only managed to find one guide on the bard epic, the one on
EQDiva, and it wasn't really very informative as to these little
details.

After Eldrig, I need white scale, red scale, and Trak guts, and
I'm done.  Oh, I guess I also need level 50?
