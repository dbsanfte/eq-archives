I'm wondering about a Dwarf cleric doing the Bullsmasher quest in
Ak'Anon.  I understand that doing it lowers your faction with the
Gnome necro guild, and you have to do the quest by killing stuff in
the Mines of Malfunction (where the Gnome necro guild is).  I also
understand that you might have to do this quest a number of times
(possibly 20 or more) before you get the Bullsmasher.  Is it possible
that you could lower your necro faction enough where you would get
attacked on sight by one of the necro guild members if you went down
to the mines again to do the quest?  (I made a dummy Gnome warrior
that worshipped Brell and she was apprehensive to the necro guild
members; don't know if a Dwarf cleric would be any lower than that).

TIA,
