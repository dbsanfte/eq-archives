I think DAoC works kind of like that...my recollection is that Power regen
(Power is the DAoC equivalent of mana) stops when you fight.

Note that for most regular group or solo fights, it would not make much
difference.  In EQ1, the places where this would make a difference are raids
(depending on how it is done), and for some kinds of soloing (like Druids
who doing root/dot/med).

I wonder how they determine when a fight is over?  Suppose your party
engages a group of mobs, and so medding is disabled.  During the fight, one
of the mobs flee.  The party still has the mobs aggro...and bad pathing or
geometry bugs prevent it from coming back.  Will the party have to camp or
zone to restore medding ability?

Or even better...your party is fighting a group of mobs, and someone else
comes by, peels one off, and kites it around the zone, keeping it just
annoyed enough to come after them rather than go back to your group.  Can he
keep your med ability turned off this way?

DAoC does (or used to do...it may have changed) this in dungeons.  It was
kind of cool.  When DAoC came out, they didn't have many dungeons--each
realm basically had only one dungeon appropriate for a given level, so the
dungeons could get very crowded.  However, the combination of the mobs not
aggroing on the way back to their spawn point, a high spawn rate, and a low
aggro range, made it so you could really pack a lot of people into a
dungeon.  It gave a sense of a big living vs. undead battle that was kind of
fun.

I think, though, I'd rather see delayed aggro rather than no aggro.  So,
someone brings a train past you, and then the train heads home.  When it
passes you again, you wouldn't be able to just ignore it--you'd want to move
out of the way.  But the aggro delay would make it so it is not like when a
wanderer comes by--you would have time to figure out some strategy.

So a rare pops, and some Druid or Bard engages, and then runs it around the
zone, hitting his "/auction Ragefire up...will bring to you and zone for 100k
plat!" macro.
