There's certainly nothing wrong with paying someone to play your character
for you, but the risk involved in dealing with a stranger is very great.  If
levels are that important to the development of your character, take Dan
Harmon's advice and buy a character.  Believe me, level 35 is not that much
different than level 25.  Now, if you were going from level 25 to level 45,
then I might say you were actually gaining something; but we would also be
talking about $200 in addition to the tremendous risk to the account.

My advice would be to keep your account active, but take a break from EQ for
awhile.  Once the baby arrives, be prepared to sleep when the baby sleeps.
It will benefit no one if you're going to bed late after playing EQ only to
be awoken by the baby an hour after your head hits the pillow.  Plus, your
wife may appreciate the help, especially if she is breast feeding.

Once you return to EQ, your character will be there, your stuff will be
there, and the world will be there just as you left it.
