Good point. If you misrepresent that you are selling them 'the account', 
and not just a username,password that you know will work on an account 
'today' then I agree, its like selling the Brooklyn Bridge. And there is 
a fraud case in there... but its between the buyer and the seller not 
SOE and either party.

That one is a tougher case to make. But I think an utter lack of real 
criminal intent would wash it out. This isn't even a case of a hacker 
'looking around'... the intent was literally to transfer an account. The 
fact that SOE says that's against the rules doesnt make it illegal. And 
who exactly is unauthorized... the new owner is the actual subscriber 
(ie he's paying the subscription), and he presses I agree before he logs 
in... hard to make a solid case that he's not authorized.
