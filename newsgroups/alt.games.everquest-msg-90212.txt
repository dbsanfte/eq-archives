For all practical purposes think of yourself as a barbarian in a kitty
suit, that pretty much nails the faction. Vah shirs are agnostic, yet
my vah shir shaman had the same factions as my barbarian shaman of the
tribunal, even in halas! (where I was amiable to the shaman trainers..
indiff to everyone else)

This even went as far as being glower dubious to many of the surefall
druids by default, just exactly like a barbarian shaman. 

Like any good race I was scowl to dark elf guards in nektulous forest
and presumeably the ogre and trolls are the same (as other poster says
cazic hates everyone)

Not sure if a barb shaman of the tribunal is glower dubious or
apprehensive to east freeport sewer people, but they are not kos. Vah
shir kitty shaman was apprehensive to them so I could do the xelha
bone chip quests. I was indiff mostly in freeport and at worst
apprehensive.

So just think logically about where you could go as a barbarian and
its pretty much the same.
