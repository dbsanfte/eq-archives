While I'm certainly not immersed in the discussions over this sort of
thing,
I have the impression that recent changes to the cleric epic were
intended
to speed up the rate at which the final mob pops and clean up the
extremely long waiting list for it.

Unfortunately, they seem to have accelerated the pop rate marginally
if at all, due apparantly to a desire to have the epic still be a rare
and
noteworthy achievment.

While a marginal change in drop rate early in the life of a server might

have created a "wait list" a month or so long, the fact is that allowing

the slower drop rate to play out for a couple years has created a
massive
backlog that is beyond unreasonable; on Morell Thule, for example,
the wait list is more than 70 people deep with a pop rate of roughly
2 per week; without the interruptions of patches, this is still on the
order of 35 weeks.

That the drop rate is still too slow is  easy to see because the length
of the list continues to grow, despite many clerics not even bothering
with the pursuit of epic because of the list lenght.

This aside, there is still the backlog to deal with.  I'm told that
another
backlog was drasticly reduced some time ago by a GM event in which
the mob in question popped every 3 hours for 3 days straight.

A similar event for Ragefire would mean 9 epics off the list... actually

a joke in terms of how extraordinarily deep that list is.  To chop the
list
in half the event would need to run for 13 days.

Now that I look at it in those terms, I'm convinced this is the wrong
solution
to the problem after all; Verant had it right.  What needs to change is
the
pop rate, not a special one time high speed event, but a reworking of
the rate itself.  At a pop rate of one per day, the list is still more
than
two months long, but the list would shorten significantly, moving to
where
new clerics on the list would expect their turn in about a month.
Tweaking
the pop rate in a couple months back up to one every two days or so, or
roughly the rate at which new people appear on the list, would prevent
this
from becoming just another Ixiblat Fer step, but still hopefully avoid
the
literally nine month wait cycle currently in place.

I'm well aware that these things have doubtless been said a hundred
times
before, and that I'm just another in a long line of frustrated clerics
being
driven slowly mad by the prospect of an epic sometime three seasons
in my future, if I'm even playing EQ still at that point.

Nothing is going to come of this proposal, but sometimes saying things
out loud is simply necessary to prevent them from stewing in the back
of my head.
