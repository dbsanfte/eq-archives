I think that the fact that many people, on a variety of servers, use the 
taxi channel to quickly get ports does a rather good job of refuting your 
poor excuse for an arguement.

Maybe on your server.  Haven't seen it on Innoruuk, but I don't hang out 
in the auction channel other than poking my head in once a day and 
announcing my intention to buy a certain item.

Why wouldn't you want to auction high end items in ToV?  What other zone 
has 150 level 55+ folks?  Yeah, it's damn annoying to see EC style twink 
gear being spammed, but I think it's perfectly fine to give limited notice 
that you are buying or selling high-end items.
