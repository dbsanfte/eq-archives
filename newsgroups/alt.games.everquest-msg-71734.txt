I once did this also. I quit for a year. I called up customer service and
asked them myself if my characters were still intact before I would
reactivate my account with them. My concern was the 3 month rule they have
in effect, where they delete characters after 3 months of inactivity. The
tech person told me that they have NEVER deleted ANYONES characters to date
because of inactivity, no matter how long it had been. Sure enough, all my
characters were present when I logged back on. Hope that helps.
