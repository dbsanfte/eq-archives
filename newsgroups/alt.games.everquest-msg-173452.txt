Isn't there a cast time on that?  Unlike a bard, you can't cast spells while running
away.  Like a bard, and every other class, you CAN click on the zone out marker while
running or getting beat to a pulp.

Egress also takes a spell slot, while zoning out doesn't.

On the other hand, if Egress clears aggro, and you have the time (not long I imagine)
to cast it, this would mean you aren't training the zone area, so you don't have to
listen to the clueless complaining about your having done so (don't hang out at the
zone area, cause most classes aren't capable of egress even if every druid does it)
and better, you only have to wait for one zone "load please wait" instead of zoning
out and then back in.  Massive time savings.

Yes, this is just what I suggested, and it does work fairly well, especially with the
"disposable pet" approach (so the pet is dead before snare wears off).  Less trivial
for enchanters, who don't have Snare capability.   In any case, well worth the effort,
since this makes the charm classes the highest DPS classes in the game... even a
ranger with maxed AA pales in comparison to what two blood ravens do in damage (your
pet hitting the target, PLUS the target hitting your pet.. since you are going to get
the exp for both kills)

Rats are lower level, lower net DPS, less exp per kill.  They might also have lower HP
totals, though, making the contribution you can put in via DS and free dots do your
work faster.  Thus for lower level druids, rat charming might be more effective -and-
less risky.  On the other hand, PON is a much more attractive zone, wandering around
in a nice forest is much more enjoyable than hanging out on some puss covered infected
skin and dodging enourmous hairs.
