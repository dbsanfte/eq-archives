There are whole college degrees that can be obtained about pricing models
and business processes involved in that decision.

If you offer something for free, it will be perceived as junk (AOL has brand
recognition now, so it is in a different boat), so you want to set a price
perceived by the buyer as a quality product.  This is amplified as computer
products compete for your attention on the shelf (Would you still package EQ
and place it on the shelf if it was free?)

Games fit the business model that says "if it costs more, it must be
better".  Why else do the hot hits come out at outrageous prices and still
get sold?  Gamers don't fret over the $10.00 more a new game costs, if they
think the product will be that much better.  As EQ has aged, and other more
tech-savvy products come out, EQ has to reduce initial cost.  This follows
exactly the early adopters model, that states some people have to have the
new item no matter the cost, then the price will drop as the seller attracts
the average joe.

You also don't want to offer it for free, or you will have thousands upon
thousands of people trying out an account (for one month) only to abandon it
very quickly, thus burdening the servers and storage capabilities of the
servers.  You have to have an entrance fee to make sure the people are
serious about the initial investment.

The initial fee helps somewhat to lower the monthly fees which is where
Sony/Verant want to price this as attractive as possible as this is the
price consumers will use to compare their choices as new MMORPG's come out.

Finally, if you shell out the money and don't like it, that same argument
can be said for any game.  Some offer a free trial download, but not all.
