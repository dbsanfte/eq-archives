Civilians who have been raised by carefully regulated propoganda think
we are hideous beasts out to destroy everything they stand for, who
will brainwash them and their children. They know what their leaders
let them learn. To them, we are a monster that needs to be destroyed
because that is the only face of America they've been allowed to see.
The worst thing in the world to do would be to prove them right.

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
