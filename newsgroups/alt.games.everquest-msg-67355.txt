Looks like you know where the shift key is, or is that the caps lock you
use?   Common convention is to capitalize the first letter in a sentence.
Also "I" should always be capitalized.  The reason for snipping is that it
is basically incomprehensible gibberish anyway, but if it will make you
happier, I did not snip it this time.

Well, even assuming I do get screwed over in this manner, how is your
warning going to help me?
