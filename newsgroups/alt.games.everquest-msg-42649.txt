What Karl didn't mention is that at lvl 9,  you would have nowhere near the
amount of money it would take to get your tailoring skill up to 87, which is
what handmade backpacks are trivial at.  I think you should just concentrate
on leveling up for now,  most people would probably advise you not to start
a tradeskill until lvl 20 at least.
