    No, this is much worse. Here's some of the bugs they've been enjoying 
for the past few months:

-people can randomly get sent to a different raid instance than the rest of 
the raid. Once that happens, they can't raid for a full week, to let their 
instance ID clear so they can rejoin their guildmates.
-remember the DoT/debuff limit issue in EQ? In WoW, mobs can have a total of 
EIGHT debuffs or DoTs on them before stuff starts falling off. Almost 
everything that deals damage has a debuff component, too - even magician 
fireballs can leave a small fire debuff. One class, the Warlock, depends on 
DoTs to deal damage, including one DoT that does a huge chunk of damage if 
it stays on the mob for one minute.
-Line of Sight issues are atrocious. Mobs in Molten Core (the one raid zone) 
can't be fought near walls, near any sort of ledge, near bumps in the 
ground, or they stop dealing melee damage.
-itemization is screwed. The axe off Onyxia, the mega-hyped dragon which is 
currently one of the hardest encounters in the game, is worse DPS than other 
more common single-groupable weapons. It looks the same as a level 40 axe 
found elsewhere in the world.
-so far, both endgame raid encounters (Onyxia and all the mobs in Molten 
Core) are functionally immune to fire, making one branch of the magician 
Talent tree (Fire) worthless. The next raid area planned is supposed to be 
in a frosty wasteland, which will make the second branch (Frost) 
functionally worthless. Even original EQ didn't have raid encounters that 
completely shut down character builds like this.
-Conquest's suspension is pretty funny. On one day, they used a hunter trap 
that snares mobs to split a boss from his guards. However, the guards and 
boss were supposed to be linked, and the trap was actually breaking the 
link. Exploit, they get a warning. Next day, they pull a boss to a safer 
room to fight him. To make the pull, they have a rogue sneak down the long, 
mob-filled hallway to the boss, then tag the boss and start running. A 
Warlock summons the rogue to the raid, and when the boss gets close the 
rogue does the WoW equivalent of Escape. Since the boss ran faster than the 
other mobs down that hallway, he's split from the hall mobs and was tagged 
and brought into the raid. However, the GMs thought they pulled the boss so 
they could exploit LOS issues, gave a second warning and subsequently 
suspended a few folks who had two warnings. The reason the GMs thought LOS 
issues had been exploited? One of the boss guards that was being offtanked 
was doing almost no damage - because the warrior Shield Block ability 
completely stops the main attack of that type of guard.

    Oh, and here's a good bug that was hotfixed (patched without bringing 
servers down) within a day of being demonstrated:

-In Molten Core, there's one boss that hits people he's aggro on with a 
debuff. If the debuff isn't cured within a minute or so of being applied, 
the person the debuff is on explodes for something like 3200 damage to 
everything around him. Warlock pets don't lose debuffs on them when banished 
by the Warlock and resummoned, to prevent Warlocks from simply dismissing a 
pet that has a negative effect on it. Combine those two, and you have what 
was recorded on a wonderful video: Warlock gets his pet to get aggro on 
boss, gets debuff on pet, banishes pet, then resummons pet later - in the 
middle of the auction house in town. Imagine a 3200 DD AE going off in the 
middle of the Bazaar to picture what happened, then add in that this 
happened on a non-PVP server, and that death in WoW degrades equipment worn.

    In comparison, modern EQ is perfection itself.

    If you want to read up on this stuff, visit the Fires of Heaven site. 
They have a lot of threads on it, and links to Conquest's site where they 
break down all the Molten Core bosses and trash. It makes a good read. I'd 
say SOE's strategy of forcing WoW to release early with the early release of 
EQ2 has been a fair success.
