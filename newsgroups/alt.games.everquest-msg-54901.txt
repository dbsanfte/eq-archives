My computer is a PoS too (k6-2 350, 128MB pc100 ram, voodoo3 3000) and I had
no problems in warsliks, except for one place near the OT zone where I'd
always graphic stagger and fall for ~40 points of damage coming up a hill,
the only thing is that you CAN'T have you clip plane set to max like you're
probably used to everywhere else, and as a side result of most people being
lazy ass I get no competition for good hunting and phat lewtz.
