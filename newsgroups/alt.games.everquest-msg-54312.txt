As has been pointed out, the answer to the question will vary wildly
depending on the lvel of the player(s) and the class. But for a "generic
group" I'd say that at the newbie levels, the giant scarabs are about
tops. (no poison, not too many HP, easy kill even when yellow.) At
higher levels, I'll agree with a previous poster and vote for the
Kodiaks in GD. Did several levels quickly on them. Low resists, not too
many HP again, fairly easy kills and good xp. Loot is total crap,
though. (There's that risk reward thingie again.)
