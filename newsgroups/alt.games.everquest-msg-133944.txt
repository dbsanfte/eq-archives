I dunno from wizzards, but as a cleric with BAotR, I find POTC
(and POTG) conflicts with both BAotR and Heroic Bonds.  Yes,
POTG is marginally better than BAotR, but not better than that
plus HB... in fact its inferior to that combination by quite a wide
margin.

Now if we had so many buffs up, needed buffs by the way, that I
had to pick between BAotR, HB, and POTG, I suppose I'd take
POTG as the best of the three.  I can't imagine that ever happening,
though, usually if I'm buried in buffs to the 15 limit, its cause I stacked
a bunch of lame icons I don't need on in front, cause I'm facing some
mean debuffer and I want some crap buffs in the way.
