You should always be courteous of other players when you Kite, and it is
definitely not recommended in all places.  One time I remember some idiot
druid was kiting mobs all around the moat area in Karnor's Castle.  Mob
aggros in that place are bad enough without people parking mobs near groups
camping the area.   Perhaps he just couldn't get a group and felt it's not
"fair" that others can.

My roommate, a druid, always give me shit cause I zone into OS and usually
get a group within 5 minutes.  Now he always wants me to start a group at
the zone in with me and him, he just couldn't believe the xp you get in that
place.  On the other hand he can travel anywhere and solo stuff anytime.  If
he wants xp he can log on for 20 minutes and get some.  If I want xp I got
to have at least a 3 hour window of play time, which in turn limits the
frequency of my playing :(

This brings me to a question.  Who would people say are the Kings of
Soloing?  I am thinking necros for levels 1-50 and druids for levels 51-60.
Any opinions?
