I'm not saying the slow wasn't landing.  Just that it was having no effect on the speed at which
the mob was hitting.

Apparantly on release, the slow mitigation was broken, such that slows over 50% had no effect,
and slows 50% or under were having full normal effect.

Then they patched and slow mitigation worked properly, so a 50% slow had a 25% slowing effect,
and 60% slow had a 30% effect and so forth.

When I finally passed the trial, though, neither 60% nor 40% nor any slow at all seemed to have
any slowing effect at all.

Its possible this is because one or another slow stuck but didn't have any effect, and then
other slows cast subsequently didn't have any slow effect because the first slow was already
hogging the slow slot.

Its also quite possible that a subsequent patch (there have been two at this point since) or
just zone patch took care of the problem.
