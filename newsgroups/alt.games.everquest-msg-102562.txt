The Chimp's mistaken simplistic understanding of how feign death worked was
that the mobs are tricked into thinking you are dead, and wander off. Once
out of normal aggro range - you pop back up, brush yourself off, top your
martini up if any was spilled, and go back to look for which powdered
calcium stain was Gimp Jnr the 103'rd.

How it actually happens is rather uncivilised and goes against the grain of
official Chimp lack of Work Ethics. It goes a little something like this:

Gimp Jr 103'rd: "Mmmmmmph....Mmmmmph....Hmph!"

Chimp: "Sorry old chap - can't hear you, the Ry'Gorr carpet your wearing is
muffling the sound and I suspect that Frost Giant's boot lodged in your
larynx is somewhat of an impediment to clear speech. Why don't I trot away a
good distance to see if the acoustics improve?"

Gimp Jr 103'rd: "Hmmphdy Hmastard!!!!"

A crumpling noise is heard to the Chimps rear.

Chimp: "My - they are a bit on the leggy side aren't they...Ouch!! Now that
was just <rude>! Better try that Feign Death ...umm...err.."Thing".

Chimp successfully feigns and from an out of body experience he watches the
horde of R'Gorr's and Frost Giants coast to a halt, shrug, then slowly
disperse mumbling. The Chimp then pops back up, brushes off the snow and
considers the next course of action.

Chimp: "Now, what was I doing again? Hmmn - maybe I should gate back to
Nexus and bank *pops up spell book and starts to memorise gate at a
leisurely pace*....or maybe I should take Gimp Jr 104'th back and see if any
of that mob ended up stray? *forgets gate and methodically starts to
memorise pet and Aug*....Dang who can concentrate with such an gadawful
racket?"

The Chimp looks up just in time to be washed away in a wave of flailing
Ry'Gorr and Frost Giant limbs....

*Loading, please wait...*
