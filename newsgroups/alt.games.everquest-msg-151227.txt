Actually, this is not accurate. There appears to be a bug with the logging
code. All of the misses from the warders are showing up twice. You can check
yourself. There are no single misses ANYWHERE. So those quads you are seeing
are actually just dual misses. The warders are not currently quadding at
all. Their Double Attack skill seems to have been removed. Conjecture is
that the pets were supposed to be made monks (previously, they were
warriors,) but were instead changed to be beastlords themselves (hence no
DA.)

The overall effect seems to be this:  the warders are doing overall damage
somewhere between pre-patch w/o weapons and pre-patch with weapons. Rich
from SOE had told us that they would be doing equivalent or better damage
than pre-patch WITH weapons. This is not the case at all. Also, the fact
that higher level mobs resist the new procs often makes the situation worse
at higher levels, where the warders seem to be doing less damage than even
the pre-patch without weapons.

Is it an upgrade? A mistake? A nerf? I'm not sure anyone knows at this
point.

EQBeastlord is full of parses/explanations though, if you care to take a
look.
