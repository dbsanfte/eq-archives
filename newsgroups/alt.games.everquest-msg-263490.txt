   Bob has said that it is his nature to play games for a few months (he
played CoH for four, I'm pretty sure) then move on.  

   Now, me, I also think that CoH is the Funnest Greatest Online Experience
Ever... for me.  I vastly prefer it to any other MMORPG I have tried.  I
joined up I think two or three weeks after it was released and have been
playing ever since.  I'll try EQII because I did play EQLive for 4 years,
and I am very interested in seeing what the SOE team comes up with a
'modern" MMORPG.  But I have my doubts that it will be able to take me away
from the fast paced action that I love about CoH.

   CoH is, I think, a niche game.  There are many, many people for whom the
niche simply doesn't work.  There are other for whom it does.  Bob enjoyed
it for a short while, and wrote of it from that perspective.  He had alot
of fun when he started, then grew bored as he does with games, and moved
on.

  I'm sorry, but I don't really see what the big scandal is here.
