Yes the quest was broken yesterday and probly still is,  they even took out
the sea spirit, I asked a GM about it aswell, and get the usual respone "we
are aware" "dont know when it will be fixxed" But Yes i did get this spell a
few weeks ago on Beta(test)  before they revamped it (3 times i think it
was) Go figure how it can stop working suddenly. Granted I dont have a
shaman on any live servers so never tested the quest out on em.

So as it stands, The spell quest is not avalible til they fix it.
