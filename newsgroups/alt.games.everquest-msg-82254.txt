Sense Heading is the first skill I work on when getting a new level.
I've been lost in the dark too many times to under appreciate the value
of it. I also use /loc, but unless I'm desperate or about to create a
corpse (my own) I try to stay away from it. It seems to take some of the
fun out of exploration when you can look at a map and know exactly where
you are by hitting /loc. I've actually panicked in this game due to
being lost. It may be masochistic but at least I know I was having fun!
I panicked last night, too, when I was trying to outrun a group of orcs
in Crushbone. I wasn't real familiar with the back passageways through
the rocks and ended up running right into the water. Which wasn't too
bad. That didn't bother me. I panicked when 3 orc centurions jumped in
after me. I was so out of sorts by that that I couldn't remember how to
get my head above water, and ended up drowning while trying to escape.
