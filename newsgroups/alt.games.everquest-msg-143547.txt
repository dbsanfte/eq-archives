Nope, doesn't look like it at all to me.
Just a bunch of conjecture.

More levels won't fit in the game, its why they did AA instead.
You'll see more AA possibly, but not more levels. Going to 60 meant
overhauling tons of the old pre kunark game, going to 70 would mean
overhauling the ENTIRE game. I don't see verant doing that. They'd NOT
leave encounters in velious and luclin as they are, they'd adjust them
for 70 level people.

255 is simply the max bit they can have, so they moved the spell limit
up to that to match the max for lots of other things.

Besides that, people forget that mobs can be above level 60....
That is probably the real reason. Highes mob I've heard of is maybe
63? Pop will likely change that.
