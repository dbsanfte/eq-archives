Being a regular and *positive* contributor to the newsgroup is what
gives Bizbee credentials. That he also rips morons apart is just icing
on the cake.

Here is something interesting you wrote:

"I would take the time to flame this sorry assed, pointless whine, but
I think instead I've read enough of your bullshit to last me a while
so I'll just killfile you. BTW, Mark's response to this was very
classy. You just made him look better and made yourself look like the
childish prick."

I guess you decided to get off your high horse.
