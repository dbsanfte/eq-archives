Oh, good lord, I don't think we've *ever* fought Phinny the "proper"
way. That zone is a pain in the butt. We have a sixty mage that invises,
swims down to the tube before phinny's area and just CotH's everyone
down there, then we pull the guards to the ledge. Doesn't take that
long. Never got called on it by a GM or anything either.

The "pull to entry" trick I've only seen work once so far. Never made
the run down with the Cleric, so I have no clue how she does it.
