Bard was probably pulling since bard lull used to last the same 5 minutes
that caster lull was lasting so got used to lulling everyting and only
getting a single (now it lasts what 12 - 15 seconds and caster lull is 42
seconds).

As for the looting an int aug, I play on FV so we loot them and roll at the
end (I like everything being droppable) another nice thing besides "if you
get a bad rep you have to start over and not look back".

I have had a great time in LDON since I moved to FV have leveled there from
20+ exclusively (now on 4th character though). My cleric is starting to
branch out at 55 now though................
