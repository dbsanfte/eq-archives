Well, there's two kind of instances in EQ2.

There's the "public" instances, which control overpopulation and lag,
and the "private" instances where you and your group get a little
dungeon all to yourselves. The first obviously is no more immersion
destroying than any kind of zoning....as for the second, well, I find
"Ah! Here we are at the Secret Crypt buried beneath the Lost Fortress
in the Hidden Valley behind the Forbidden Mountains! Let's get in line
behind those 200 people to wait for the Overlord Of The Mysterious
Depths to spawn, so we can kill him! Our group will be about...tenth
in line, it looks like" to be much more immersion destroying than
instanced zones.
