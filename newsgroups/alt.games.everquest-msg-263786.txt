Eh.  My UO experience would seem to disagree, but some of it was...
cultural, I suppose.  In UO you had two camps:  folks who's crafters
were characters in their own right (sometimes even mains) despite not
being adventurers, and folks who's crafters were nothing more than
mules/slaves to support their adventuring characters.

I love anything which encourages the former camp, and despise that
which encourages the latter.
