Depends on what sort of "fitness" you're looking at. I can be fit for
one thing but not for another. Here we're speaking purely fitness to
survive, and even then, that depends on the circumstances you're
trying to survive. "Fittest" simply means "best suited".

In most cases, there's a good reason why the survivor survives.
