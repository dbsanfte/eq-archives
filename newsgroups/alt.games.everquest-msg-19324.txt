This is my solution to bugging Shamans and Dr00ds for SOW.  I do
drive by DMF's whenever I am in a position to do so.  Mostly I
target Shamans and Dr00ds, but I do cast on others as well.  I am
always thanked for this and my normal response is "You are very
welcome.  Next time you see me give me a SOW if mana and time
allows".

You would not believe the number of times I have gotten drive by
SOW's.  Hard to say if any of these were people that got DMF, but
either way my Necro walks sooooo slow that I am very happy to move
even a bit faster.
