Was killing HGs around level 38 and a group took him down and I looted it.
no camping here

Camped him for 2 hours with a friend, left, assassin and cleric move in to
camp Bergurgle, rogue sends me a tell 5 minutes later "you were looking for
the corrupted goblin?"  He MQ'ed the piece for me about 2 hours later.

Killed this guy about 5 times just running to Permafrost for a farming spree
(2 runs of go in and ninja a Runed Circlet and Mammoth cloak, I've never
even seen mammoth pants)

Haven't touched him yet.

Killed seafurys for loot and had him killed when he popped, no dedicated
camping here, did have to kite him though while the necro killed Quag ("You
will not evade me!"  "Dammit, I said, You will not evade me!" "Stop evading
me already and GET OVER HERE!") that was fun.

I hate you.  I was scouting the place out (no tainted up) and got swarmed
after a swirlspine in undertow's room saw through invis.

He was up on track once but I was on my way to camp Xalgoz for my HS key
with a friend (god that camp SUCKS, I kept falling asleep pulling the church
to my mage friend meatgrinder, got my key though)  If I had stopped to kill
him we would've ended up behind 8 people for him, as it was we were only
behind one person (which meant an extra fang), and he left about an hour
before the spawn.

> Batmen-on-twinkies never did me any favors; Tzirathk did.

Haven't been back to CoM since Tzirathk has been there, guild been too busy
leveling.
