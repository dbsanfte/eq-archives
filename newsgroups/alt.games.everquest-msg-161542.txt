I've got a Level 17 Human Enchanter.  Serpent Sight is identical to
Illusion: Half Elf, Illusion: Wood Elf, and Illusion: High Elf as
far as vision goes.  Identical.

As far as screenshots go, I've quit taking them.  For some reason my
screenshots always seem have lighting approximating that of a single
candle at midnight in dark panelled inner room.
