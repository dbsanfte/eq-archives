Who she's going home with and who she's going to bed with at the end of the

Although I wouldn't put it in such crude terms...

Yes, it is perfectly all right with me if my wife, under certain
circumstances, has sex with others...

Our relationship is 1000% secure and is not threatened one iota by the
concept of recreational sex with others.

In other words, she may have all the sex she wants, but we both know
who she is going home with at the end of the night..  :^)
