Because the intent of my post was to describe the combat system that exists 
in EQ2 today. It wasn't my intent to compare it to what has come before. I 
could do that, too, but that would have been a very different write-up. This 
isn't a hard concept to grasp, but I get the sense that you're having a hard 
time with it probably because you're worried that all the discussion over 
the new game in town is going to drag away interest from your apparent game 
of choice, FFXI. Relax, grow up, and learn to live in a world with many 
choices. Nobody's pulling the plug on your console.
