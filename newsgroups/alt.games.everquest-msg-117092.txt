I was assuming that the melee in question learned from the event that having
some means of removing the blindness would be highly desirable.  I also
assumed that said melee would hotkey it with the full knowledge that being
blinded would make it quite difficult to find an item and click on it.  The
melee in question had no way to dispell, and, thus, was completely helpless
while blinded.  She was a warrior in particular, so even so, I had to
cannibalize myself down to almost nothing to come up with enough mana to
nuke her down.  It was a planned guild event.
