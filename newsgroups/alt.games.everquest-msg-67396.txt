Ok, I'll buy that one.

The 400MhZ computer has 384MB of RAM (max allowable on that
system, unless I want to pay three times as much for
Registered DRAM memory).

I also have a 500MhZ with 512MB of RAM, it runs a tad smoother
than the previous one, but not immensely so.

The only places I have to do some major changes in the clipping
plane are in Catville, and the middle of Shadow Haven (the edges
of the zone and the outlying districts are fine).

On the other hand, my 733MhZ with 128MB is a dog -- not so
much when I look around a zone, as when I try to change zones,
or do something that causes any swapping (like bringing up
the inventory screen in Shadow Haven; then I get major
disk chugging).
