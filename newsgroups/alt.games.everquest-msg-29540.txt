Nah, that's not a better question.  But, the answer is: because I'm not
interested in just doing what a lot of people do - farm and grind Exp.  I
don't roleplay, either, but the languages come in handy now and then when
I'm asking someone a question or a favor.  I switch to their language and
some people get a kick out of it, and seem more willing to help.

People in my Guild are real interested in learning languages, and now I am
in the position to teach them when we group.

It's part of the game and adds a little diversity.  Not counting the RP
server, they may actually make languages useful in the game.  If so, I'm
prepared.

On a side note, I was mastered at everything but Dragon the other day.  I
was Excellent at Dragon, so I only needed a few points to master.  I was
cruising to the bank in NFP when a guy /auctions that he will train people
in languages for a fee.  I stop in my tracks and send him a tell asking him
if he has mastered Dragon.  He replies that he has, and Elder Dragon to
boot.  I inquire whether he will master me, and let him know that I am
already excellent so it will take 30 seconds at most to do it, and that I
will trade him any language for the time he is mastering me.  He says he
normally charges 30pp to master someone, but agrees to do it, althought
somewhat reluctantly ( since I'm not 'paying' him ).

He masters me quickly, while I spam him.  I thank him and have to run to
WFP.  He's begging me to stay and master him all the way from "0".  I spam
him until I zone, talk to my Guild-mate whom I was meeting, and we decide to
meet at the bank.  I zone back to NFP and spam the guy some more, because
I'm basically a nice guy.

My Guild-mate shows up, so I ungroup with the guy and thank him again.  He
starts sending me tells begging me to master him in some languages.  I told
him 30 plat and he got pissed.

Odd.
