Thanks for all your suggestions, everyone. Turns out that it was a very
simple fix. On installation, EQ defaulted itself to a higher resolution than
the monitor could handle. Don't know why it did that, and I hadn't adjusted
the resolution settings when I installed it, but that was apparently the
problem. Of course, I didn't discover that until several days of fiddling,
fixing, and cursing had gone by...
