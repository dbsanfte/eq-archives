Thats a bug, the guy always stands there and bitches at you if you hail him,
saying that he just wants some peace and quiet and to be left alone to
fish... Evidently he double spawned ( or respawned without the old one
de-spawning )  a while back.

Do you happen to play on the Seventh Hammer? I ask that, because thats where
I noticed it.

Man I love that zone. Someone had a wicked imagination when they dreamed
that place up, and a cruel streak when they created the festering hag and
made her look like a normal undead.
