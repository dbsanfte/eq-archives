God dammit Me Too!!

I'm quitting EQ. I've found Jesus, and he tells me that there is no room in my life for
this game. He says it's Satan's tool. Also, I'm becoming a priest, so I won't have time to
play anymore. I can only hope that my friend Hatecrusher can find Jesus as well.

Besides that, ever since my corpse rotted, the game hasn't been the same for me. I can't
stand to live without my items, and I just can't take it anymore. Thanks a whole not
Earthsweeper and his group for leaving me in the Hole and refusing to help me get my
corpse out, you fucking assholes. I hope you burn in hell where your skin will be shaved
off daily by horrible demons.

Anyway, everyone who plays EQ is a big fucking loser. You should all be ashamed of
yourselves, you pale-skinned freaks of nature. Why don't you go outside and get some
sunlight, you freaks of nature? I'm done posting here now, forever. Bye losers!

Love and kisses,
John M Clancy
