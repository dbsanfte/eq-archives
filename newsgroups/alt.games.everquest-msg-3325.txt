My rogue is doing just fine at 37 with piercing, my 1hs
hasn't been used in about 15-17 levels, basically when i got
a second magic piercer, and got rid of the gnoll hide lariat
i was using in my off hand.

Don't regret that decision yet, Harpoon of the depths, and a
tombcarver.  Slap a haste on me, and i make a mean
impersanation of a ginsu knife.
