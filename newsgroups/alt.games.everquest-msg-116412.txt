Well, imagine in a group where you have a monk puller, tank,
enchanter, cleric, and 2 others.  All but the "2 others" should get
the peridot symbol.  In Seb, where I the cleric am getting gems,
everyone gets symbol.  Anyway, being conservative with the peridots,
you can spend over 160pp in a 4 hour session.  I have never seen the
cash split come close to covering this.  If the split is really
3000pp, then the cleric used way more than 10 peridots, I guarantee.
Even in your example, is it really fair that the cleric only gets
400pp while everyone else gets 500pp?  Over time, this adds up.

Maybe I've just been in bad groups.  Perhaps you imagine the ML
selling off the gems (not the BDs, diamonds, of course, which are
usually lottoed), and then splitting the cash.  I've never seen this
happen.  The ones who really get screwed are the ones who leave before
the ML does.  The ML often forgets to split.

Groups do not bother to ask how much I've spent, or offer to
compensate.  I get the same cash split as everyone else, with the
except of Sebilis usually.  

One method I like is to have the cleric ML.  Cleric subtracts peridot
from the cash loot and splits the remaining money.  All gems are
lottoed.  I've done this in Chardok, and did not have to leave "alone
and broke" for a change.  And no one had to leave empty handed.
