I'm not sure if you have access to Telewest (Blueyonder) or NTL, but they
have a pretty good broadband service for around �25 per month. I actually
use Telewest Surf Unlimited on a 56k modem, only �10 a month for an
unmetered service, and no annoying disconnections every 2 hours or so.
Pretty good connections usually, more than adequate for raid conditions
also.
