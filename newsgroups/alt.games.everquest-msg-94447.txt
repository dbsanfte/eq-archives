Here's EXCELLENT directions I received almost 2 years ago for a run I
was making from Qeynos to Freeport. If you use them backward, You
should be fine.

My preferred travelling method between the coasts, zone by zone:

1:  Enter West Karana from Qyenos hills, and immediatly take a hard
right to the south until you hit the river.  Be careful if you do this
at night, there's a small chance that you'll run across a Werewolf
near the Qyenos Hills canyon.  When you reach the water,  cut left and
follow the beach to the east.  Try to stick as close as you can to the
water.  There's usually not anything that wanders down that part, but
you might hit a couple wandering bandits.  This is a pretty long jog,
a good five minutes at last.  Keep running until you hit the North
Karana zoneline.
2:  When you enter North Karana, keep to the shoreline.  In a little
bit you'll reach the spires and the white bridge.  The bridge tower
usually has a vendor inside it if you need to buy provisions.  If not,
run right past the bridge, staying to the shoreline.  You're looking
for the large wooden bridge that leads to East Karana.  Be careful,
there's a raider camp about halfway between the two bridges.. if you
see a group of NPCs standing on a peice of shoreline jutting out,
steer clear of them.  Keep running until you reach the East Karana
bridge, and cross it.
3:  East Karana. From here you have two choices.  keep to the road
straight ahead and go through Highpass, which is faster, or try to run
through the Gorge and Runneye, which is safer than HHP, but slower,
and requires that you know a lot about the Gorge, Runnyeye, and Misty
Thicket.  Being  only level 10, HHP would probably be better for you,
as it only requires running through one zone full of things that'll
kill you.  Head sraight out from the bridge, following the road until
you hit the sign marker.  Take the right fork in the road.  keep your
eyes open, the road is just full of Lions and Hounds, any one of which
would kill you quite easily.  Keep on the road until you reach the
ramp.  You'll know it when you see it, just take the ramp up.. and be
careful that one of the named Cycs isn't standing in front of it.  The
ramp is a remarkable experience.  I won't ruin it for you, but let's
just say that you should watch your step... and try to make sure you
do make the run at daytime.  After a few minutes, you'll finally hit
the canyon into High Hold Pass.
4:  Get a map or a guide.  HHP is a maze.  Fortunatly, there's quite a
few guard NPCs to run to if you get attacked, but don't rely on them.
If you can, try to get a bind to the Keep.
5:  Kithicor:  If you want to have some real fun, bank everthing at
the keep, get a bind, and try running this zone at night.  With no
Sow.  And stick to the road.  However, if you actually want to stand a
good chance at living through this, Go during the daytime (if you can,
sometime during the mid day when most everything has been killed
allready), and stick to high to the zone wall, and run to the right.
You'll pass the Rivervale entrance tunnel shortly.  Run past it, stick
to the wall, and eventually you'll hit the canyon to the commonlands.
6:  The commons.  Just stick to the left hand side of the zone
(Shadomen, Giants, and Undead are found on the right hand side) and
just keep running.  You'll pass a few orc and Dervish camps, but
they're usually being occupied by other adventurers, so it's pretty
safe.  Just keep your eyes open for Lions and Griffons.  Keep running,
you'll hit the West (east?) commons before long, and eventually
Freeport.
