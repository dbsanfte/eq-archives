 Actually I don't know why they bother giving a time window in the first
place. It should read like this.

All servers are down for maintenance.

 The Maintenance time for all EQ worlds is what ever we decide it to be. We
are very sorry
 for the inconvenience, but should have them back up, just to go down a few
more times. Keep in mind, when they go down again, we will tell you to call
Tech Support as usual. And please know up front, Tech Support is usually
closed when you need them. Please take time to enjoy all the complaining in
the Chat Room, followed by qualified GMs showing you how to change text
colors.
