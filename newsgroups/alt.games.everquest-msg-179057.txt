The negative count is correct, so it must be the former.  :-p

Personally, I think that unarmed Druids should be required to wear
dresses like the int-casters they're imitating.  But then, in EQ
I'm a melee by preference, when I play a caster it's mostly just
to get a better understanding of what they can do.  Even so I just
can't imagine playing my Druid without a weapon in hand, no matter
how futile it is to attempt melee with him in most circumstances.
That's probably why I've never played an int-caster past L17, it
just doesn't seem right to be so utterly helpless.
