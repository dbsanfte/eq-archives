I hadn't actually been to Tower of Frozen Shadow in about a year. But
after what you said today, I paid it a visit.

Exactly the same thing. Attempting to zone in caused a lockup.

I know three zones now that are acting very VERY badly for a large
number of people - GD, CC, and ToFS.

Something is wrong and its getting wronger. :-)
