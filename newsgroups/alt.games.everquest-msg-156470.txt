Sorry, no.  Thats a bullshit dodge if I ever heard one.   Paldains can heal
almost as good as some of the priest classes, and are one of the only two
classes able to rez..  And now you want to be able to tank better than a
warrior too?   Why not give paladins ports and manaburn too and just be done
with it.

You cannot "balance the melee only" and ignore the tremendous advantage that
those spells give you.

I mean, hell, using your arguments, rangers need a huge damage improvement
too.  Since if they dont' buff themselves with any of thier atk spells,
they're down to only doing as much damage as a warrior, and spells shouldn't
matter, we're only talking melee...
