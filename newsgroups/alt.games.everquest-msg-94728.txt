All I can say is, EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!

Man, I HATE it when that happens. We had a wizard quit our guild after
getting a double dose of that medicine in DN. (A swarm of rats in the
tunnels takes a *long* time to finish off, and they are no more kindly
disposed to the recently rezzed than your worms are. We had a guest with
us who had a click stick, and she was just trying to "keep everyone in
the fight")

I feel your pain, shorty.
