Reading your question I keep coming back with, 2 answers.

 No, not really, for reasons given elsewhere.  Fights like agnarr, Sol
Ro, MB and RZ logistically need 18-25 people for a success.

But more importantly WHY?   that group should be able to romp through
tipt, sneak through KT and frolic in the joys of the primals in Yxxta.
I'm not trying to criticise your playstyle and choices, but there isn't
really any compelling reason to do elementals unless you can move on
through them to easier content(time).   Elemental XP for groups is
largely OBE by MPG or RSS or various spots in PoR, and loot will likely
be from boring to WTF.

That being said, if you can hook up with a team or group that will
accept you as members without dropping a guild tag, there are usually 2
or three on each server doing that level of content just for the joys
of saying Yes, I broke into time the hard way.
