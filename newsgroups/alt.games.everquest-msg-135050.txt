 Assuming Gorange Club is primary only, which it looks to be, it does
slightly more damage per second. However, it's a bit on the heavy side
for a Monk. Also, the Smite on the Wu's effect usually goes off 2-3
times a fight so that  probably evens out the damage output (after
level 35). 

 I personally would go with the Wu's unless I was grouped in ME and was
able to loot a Gorangas for free.
