Should I get Shadows of Luclin or make the switch to Dark Age of Camelot?

Ok, I would really like everyone's honest opinion on this one. I have been
playing EQ for about 3 months. Have a 16 Wizard and 9 Cleric. Have joined a
good guild and enjoyed the game for the most part. Here's the problem.

Actually bought a new PC recently (Athlon 2.2 Ghz, 256 DDR ram, 32 meg
GeForce 2) to better enjoy today's newer games, primarily Shadows of Luclin.
The graphics in EQ are actually lower quality now, because I had a Voodoo 3
card in old PC and EQ supported Glide. Side Note: Glide IS that much better
than Direct 3D.
Did Verant go ahead with their plans to discontinue compatibility with Glide
in SOL? If not, I'd rather put my old 16 meg Voodoo card in the new PC.

I think some of the problems are not due to Geforce 2 vs. Voodoo, such as
the poor night vision recently due to the absence of fog effects. Is this a
SOL bug that Verant just hasn't fixed yet; I hope it's not permanent? I'm
also a little pieved at them for announcing the ridiculous RECOMMENDED
system req. of 512 meg of RAM. What! My new PC is already obsolete,
according to Verant?

Especially like to hear from those of you who have played both games. Is
Dark Age of Camelot graphics better on GeForce 2 than Everquest now? Is it
that much better as far as gameplay goes? Or anything else that you can
think of?

Thanks in advance.
