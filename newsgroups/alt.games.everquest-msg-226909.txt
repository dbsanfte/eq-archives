You missed . Your description is actually fairly accurate for a monk as they
are indeed nothing but dps . A rogue has several abilities that make him
unique . Invisibility that works better than any of the castable
invisibility types, this one is really key as it allows them to do tasks and
explore like no other class ever can, also allowing retrieval of bodies from
the entrance of dungeons that dont allow summoning or cohing to where the
raid is. The ability to completely lose aggro on a permanent basis- Feign is
a poor stepchild to this and though it requires aa abilities it is
considered a key ability (similiar to paragon for a bl). There are a number
of doors, some of which are in absolutely critical spots, that can only be
opened by rogues . There are a number of traps in some rare dungeons that
are completely lethal, someone to disarm these traps is nice. In ldon hards
and raids ; chests, barrels,etc are not just ornaments, they can contain the
majority of the loot, without a rogue some percentage of this loot is lost
forever.

Rogues are thus ESSENTIAL for about half of all raid content. The other half
they are only the highest dps class available over long fights (well at
least when rangers aren`t feeling snippy). Rogues dont suffer particularly
much in groups either.
