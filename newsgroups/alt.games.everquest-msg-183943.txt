As lvl 25 paladin, there is no better place in the game in my mind than to
get your butt over into Unrest - esp if you have your ghoulbane but even
without you should be fine.  You should be able to solo the first floor
entry level area and likely clear the round room on your own too.  And you
can also get into Basement groups at that level and mop the floor.  Or a 2nd
floor group.  I just went from 26-32 there in a few weeks and I only play
maybe 4 - 6 hours a week at the absolute max.  Once you hit 30 and get your
Nife spell, stack that with your ghoulbane and you make short work of those
festering hags.

Anyway, food for thought.  Have fun :)
