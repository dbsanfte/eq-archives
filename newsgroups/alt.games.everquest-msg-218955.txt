Teckla gets an invite from Happy the beastlord.  Groups up with
him, naturally buffs him up so his heals go further, and
surprise, disband.  Happy goes off and solos with his larger HP
and AC, and Teckla now has 85% of his mana pool.... for the next
several hours, till Happy happens to die; if Happy is clever, he
manages not to die, and doesn't even log, when he has to quit
playing for the night he does so in the bazaar, selling the loot
he's made off the back of Teckla, Fritz the enchanter (who gave
him a 65% haste sometime last week) and Lief the druid (who's
high level DS Happy is still sporting from two weeks back).

This handy sounding change is really a nightmare for any buff
caster, you've taken the KEI problem (which applies to Temperance
and so forth as well, of course) where a long lasting buff means
that people have -less- reason to group with you, and added a
permanent rather than temporary loss of mana to go with it.

If you change it so it only lasts as long as the person is
grouped with you then you drastically alter the shape of raids;
now a single caster of each class can't share out the buffs over
the entire raid; thats the opposite of MGB, which most raid
buffers see as a holy grail of sorts.  And when people LD, what
then, they are dropped from group or raid... now you have the
nightmare that pet classes have, where they suffer mass loss of
time every time they LD, only multiplied by every person you are
trying to keep buffed.

Add in some way for the caster to turn the buffs off and you
might have something.

But what exactly?  Well, currently you cast a buff, spending say
15% of your mana pool, and it lasts 15 minutes or more.  You med
that lost mana back in 30 seconds, or perhaps a minute.  So
really it only cost you a fraction of a % of your mana over the
15 minutes.  You'd have to make the mana cost extremely small for
your version to match up with what we are currently spending.

Want to see a buff that works this way, though?  Try a bard.  Now
it would seem their buffs work the reverse of the way you
suggest; 18 second duration and no mana cost.  But the
combination means that to keep a given buff on your group, you
sing it every 18 seconds like clockwork.  Since you can sing at
most 5 songs this quickly, you are essentially spending 20% of
your casting potential on each buff you keep going.  Want to keep
something else up instead, or damage or debuff the mob(s) you are
fighting?  Drop one of the things you were keeping on the party.

Clearly bards do just this, and it can work; but its a very
different magic system than what any other class is currently
using.
