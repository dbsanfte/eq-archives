Several of our guild members have recently decided to play on Stromm
permanently.  What is it about being poor as heck, and a newbie, that
attracts them away from their lvl 50-60 character that we need sorely to
keep our guild healthy?  Our guild cannot be the only one hit by the Stromm
phenomenon.

Is there any way to keep these people or is there no hope?
