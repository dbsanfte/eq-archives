Yep, it wrapped pretty badly, but your info was good!

It appears that Outpost has some kind of discrepancy in their
database -- if you go to www.outpost.com and search for "luclin"
you can see that SoL is $19.95 on the results page.  If you
click Buy FROM THAT PAGE, you get it for $19.95.  However, if
you click on the product info first, it says $29.95...

Anyway, here's the Buy link if anyone needs it.  Double check
the price in your shopping cart just in case they get the
databases back in sync!
