First point to remember above all else is how Sony views us, all of us.  We
are account #s.  They don't know individuals, because they can't.  I am, in
a legitimate count, a single raider.  In Sony's eyes, though, I'm three
highly active players (all they can see).

Take a peek at a discussion that has some thoughts and anecdotal evidence on
this very topic:

http://p201.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=49136.topic

I also think, based purely on anecdotal evidence, that raiders are far more
likely to go inactive as players while keeping accounts active.  Corollary
number one is that there is a large portion that fall into that category
that keep more than one account active.

And finally, I believe Sony *tries* to make these very counts.  They do
things *based* on their perception of their user base.  Not that they can't
be wrong.  Hell, I'm definitely not one to argue that.  =P  But they have
more likelihood of being right than either of us.  =)

I think raiders are more likely to have active accounts long after they have
"moved on".  I had someone ask me the other day if I wanted to take over an
account that had a necro sitting on Xegony's island because they didn't want
to pay for it anymore.  That account being active surprised even me, as it
hadn't been used in nearly two years and the person asking hadn't played in
about a year (and I was aware of at least two other accounts that the person
had active for that entire time).

In the raiding game, where "burnout" is a constant issue (for some, and for
others never an issue at all, also another discussion), it isn't uncommon at
all for 20% of a raiding guild's "active" players to be MIA at any one time. 
Not gone for good, but gone for now, with every intention and expectation of
coming back and jumping right back into raiding with their spot reserved by
their past performance.

That makes me wonder even more.  If you've heard of the "Simon Says" raid
encounters and other ways they've increased the creativity (and their recent
focus on individual accountability), and also seen the creativity of killing
off defunct golems, transporting a flower in a fertilized flower pot,
following hidden footsteps, etc., how can you say that the single group
content is any less creative.  Yes, they could do so much more.  But that
applies to the raiding *and* single group game.  I will grant that
creativity in the scripting of single group encounters is most definitely a
DoN+ thing.  It just wasn't done much if at all in the past.
