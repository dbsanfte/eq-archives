This is actually wrong.  I'd assumed you had misspoken yourself and meant to
type "monks do comparable damage to rogues" or something close to that.  It
doesn't even need to be comparably equipped.  If the rogue can get and keep
the back side, they're going to outdamage the monk by a good margin.

You'd have to be a pretty damn uber monk to make up for 500 point double
backstabs every 5 seconds, compared to 150? point flying kicks.

The rogue probably does a good 10 or 15 percent more damage than a
comparably equipped monk, assuing perfect conditions.  That was the target
Verant was aiming for anyways.
