You are a "High Elf" Cleric. High Elves are noted for their aloofness
(sp) and their arrogance. They are a proud people that are not quick
to accept outsiders. It would be completely in character for you to
NOT heal someone that you felt was "unworthy". Let the will of Tunare
guide you (in other words don't play heal-slave to anyone).

Then don't play against your nature. Unless the other players are
paying your montly subscription fee, they have no claim to your time
or attention. Anyone that will not take a polite "no" for an answer,
is not worth your time anyway.

You could always use Lenny as a bouncer. Have him /duel anyone that
comes up and annoys you. (You can Res at 14, and no EXP is lost in a
duel). It would be great roleplay, and explain why you keep his
company.
