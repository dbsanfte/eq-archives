A friend just got EQ and had troubles getting it to run.  During loading he
gets the message "You have been disconnected" and gets kicked back to server
selection screen.  Did thorough file check, made sure he has DirectX 8.1 and
most recent Nvidia drivers, blah blah blah...same problem.  Tech support
isn't available today, so just wondering if anyone knows a workaround for
his problem.
At least I can still play, hehe!

TIA for any advice,
Sean...
