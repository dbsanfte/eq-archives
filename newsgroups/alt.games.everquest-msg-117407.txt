Well, clerics are the best healers by far...

That would depend on what you call "the long run."  Unless
you're planning on end-game material, a shaman is a far
better choice for just about all XP camps.

And that's possibly true, at least among those who aren't
planning on end-game material.   You've also forgotten the
prime benefit of having a cleric:  the ability to XP rez.

Stuns will eventually become very important once mobs
gain the ability to Gate (and it's helpful to stop caster mobs
at any level.)   Even at low levels Stun can be used to help
damage avoidance and to stop runners in their tracks.  Root
is useful for ghetto crowd control at any level and is a form
of ghetto snare, if needed, although prone to being broken.

The cleric undead DD line is actually pretty effective as well,
of course, but that limits hunting areas quite a bit.

So, no, you won't *always* be just a healer.  But you should
count on doing nothing else probably 95% of the time...
