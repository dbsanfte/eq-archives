It will be, if they fix it.  It was hell on Test tonight.  I wish they'd 
just be done with it and allow EQw.  Tonight: logged in, got told my ui 
files were wacked and I should be using default.  I was fairly certain I 
was, but hit /loadskin default just in case.  Checked a vendor for 
something and found out that every time I hit ALT, the mouse cursor was 
released, and I'd have to click in the EQ window to get back in.  Okay, 
slightly annoying, but liveable.  Then hit alt+enter and crashed to 
desktop.  Okay, annoying, but it's Test, and I did see some mention 
before I crashed about that being a problem.  Load up again and I find 
out that although alt+enter crashed me, it did register, and I'm now in 
fullscreen mode.  I just get started on fiddling and I go LD.  Okay, not 
the game's fault.  Load up AGAIN.  Hit alt+enter, get to windowed mode 
without incident.  Hit alt and... the mouse cursor is released, but 
won't click anywhere outside of the EQ window.  The EQ mouse cursor is 
still there *and* it's shadowing the windows cursor's moves - not 
exactly shadowing, so positioning it can be a pain in the ass.  And if I 
click, it registers as a click on the EQ window cursor.  I click on the 
EQ window to go back into the game and - it won't go back to the game.  
I now have permanent double cursors, the important one of which isn't 
responding properly and is thus a problem when trying to work with the 
game.  At this point, I hook up with two other people on Test, and one 
goes AFK, so I decide to try camping out to fix it.  I hit alt+enter, 
figuring I might as well check to see if I crash to desktop again or 
not.  I didn't, which was good, and I also got back to just one cursor, 
which was also good.  Needless to say though, I didn't fiddle with it at 
all the rest of the night. >_<
