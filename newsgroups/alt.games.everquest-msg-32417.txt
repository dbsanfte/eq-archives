I used stick with groups that were no fun or worse because I was the only
cleric in them and they were deep inside some dungeon.  But why?  Again, I
play this game for fun and if the group isn't fun, why should I stay in it?
And those groups I gated away from were less than fun.  They were a pain.  I
can't tell you how angry I get when some tank says "HEAL" during a combat.
Gosh, maybe there's a reason I'm not healing them.  Or when the puller tells
me what mana level I should be happy with and is right for pulling.  What
would then happen in such puller situation is that I would lie what my level
is so the puller pulled when I felt I could handle the next pull.  Or when
no one talks at all and it isn't because we're in a pulling frenzy.  And I
won't even go into looting.

From the very start, my real life friends that have been playing EQ since it
came out have told me to disband from any group you're not having fun with.
They have repeatedly said if the group doesn't know how to treat a cleric
nicely, you owe them nothing.  That it is better to go without a group then
staying with a bad group.  That if I had done this, I might not have burnt
out in my mid-20's.  Since coming back, I've now taken this advice to heart
and I think it has helped my enjoyment of the game.  I don't like disbanding
from groups, but overall I feel better for doing so.  Fortunately, I'm a
cleric so it is easy for me to find another group.
