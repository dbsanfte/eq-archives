Using Instant Messenger earlier.  Friend sent me a message.  I automatically
hit "R", so the message she got was "rHey there!"
It gets worse...she plays too, told me "Use Group Talk idiot..."

Have two friends who are sick.  Without thinking, I asked them if they
wanted me to cast "Cure Disease".
They didn't hesitate to say "Please...will donate" (they play too)

hmmm...perhaps time to step away from the KB for a bit
