Sounds like you've got the method finely honed - in a level or two try
using it in East Karana.

Griffawns are about level 16-18 I think, when you start getting blue or
green ones you can charm them with some success. They, like all
griffon-type mobs, are huge melee undercons, but easy enough to kite  at
arms length.

So charming a green griffawn gets you a pet with the charm and fear
resists of a green, but the meleeing ability of a red - now go and take
down a red crag spider with it (maybe giving it some help like a
damageshield, the odd heal, feral spirit or whatever). If it wins, great
- you've just killed a red spider and the pet is so low on health that
you can probably kill it with one nuke for more xp (maybe, depending on
its level). If it loses, it will have got the spider down so far that
you can easily finish it off. Just don't melee the spiders yourself -
they have nasty poison.
