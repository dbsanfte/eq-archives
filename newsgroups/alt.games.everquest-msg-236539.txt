The amount of extra mana that you get from increasing your Wis goes up
as you level up in 2 ways, with the exception of anything in excess of
200 wis which is pretty static.  The first is that as you increase in
level the cap on your stats increases.  Therefore for someone wearing
200 wis of items at lvl 1 not all of it would count in the
calculation.  After that the amount of mana earned by each extra Wis
increases as per the above formula, for example:

Plat Jasper Ring:  6 Wis, cost around 125pp in the bazaar, less if you
can find someone training in JC (plat bar 110pp, jasper about 1pp)

At lvl 1 this is worth 3 mana
By lvl 16 its 51 mana
At lvl 65 (not that you'd be still wearing it then!) it would be 208
mana.

These assume that the item would not increase you Wis over 200.  For
anything over & above that its about 6 mana per 1 wis.

An item with Mana Preservation is well worth having as part of your
eqipment.  MP1 works with all spells to lvl 20, MP2 with spells to lvl
44.  They give a 10% reduction in the cost of casting the spell so
effectivly increasing your mana pool by that amount.  So an item such
as Black Alloy Medallion (ac6 5 Wis 5 Int, MP2) would, at lvl 16
increase you mana pool by 48 & reduce the mana cost of every spell you
cast by 10% on every spell upto you lvl 44 spells.

Other focus effects to look out for are Spell Haste, which reduces the
cast time of spells by 15% (handy for heals) & Improved Healing, which
increases the amount you heal by 20%.

One of the easiest ways to search for equipment is to use the Bazaar. 
Select Cleric, you race, wis & see what comes up.  I'd do it
individually for each slot to get an idea of what works where.  On
Povar there seems to be a lot of Old World items coming to the bazaar
pretty cheaply so well worth some time checking.

Good luck with your search!
