Oh, good point, David. That person's anecdotal "evidence" that the hell
levels are suddenly harder and his xp rate has been nerfed (with no logs
to back it up) certainly sells me.

Oh, and did you notice? They stealth nerfed the plat drop rate on the
Lake Rathe HG's during that patch too. I *know* that they were dropping
more plat before the patch.

Bastards.
