While its not "twinked" as such, which is to say the gear isn't given to you by a
higher level character of your own or someone else's, the effect is much the
same.

Gear in the bazaar is available at a massively deflated price, due to the
workings of mudflation.   Gear that three years ago would have fetched a kings
ransom is now available for a few platinum, its practically like the high level
guy thats selling it is giving it away.

Sadly, though, the progression the OP seems to be after, which is to say a series
of armor quests one after the other, isn't really implemented in the game; the
newbie quest he did for what he's wearing now was added long after the game was
released, and there's no natural progression to another quested armor really.
Banded is a good choice for that "step", especially if he goes ahead and forges
it all himself, the next warrior quest set is Crafted, and if he wants to stick
to questing that himself that could occupy him up into his early 30s, at which
point he could be working on Twilight Sea armors to keep him busy thru his mid
40s, then replace that with Plane of Hate/Fear (not sure which zone drops warrior
armor or perhaps both do) when over 46, then from there quest the Thurgadin gear
off Kael Drakkar armor drops, then lets see, TOV/HOT gear and finally NTOV gear
before running thru the full gamut of velious quest armor?

But he can probably buy better than the hate/fear gear before hitting 30 these
days, if he's willing to go as far as farming cash and doing some careful
shopping.
