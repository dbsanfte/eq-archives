Welcome to the Shaman class...

Definately got that right...

No, not really... but...

Ok, maybe I am being a little jaded. Invis to Undead called Unlife
Awareness, Shrink called Ant's Potion are a few that sell rather well, along
with SoW called Blood of the Wolf.

I have NOT sunk alot of time or plat in Alchemy, which I actually regret at
this point. 52 shaman with a skill at 86, and just the other day I had a
iksar send me a tell and ask me if my skill was good enough to make FoB port
potions *doh*.  I spent a ton of plat and time on smithing, which has it's
advantages, but I can tell you this: potion making is next for me. Not only
as a major part of the Shaman class *you could also ask why rogues spend
time and money making poisions, which may be the most unused advantage in EQ
altogether* but some of the Luclin potions make me drool... Elixer of
Greater Concentration, for one... and yes, it's extremely pricey to make.

Oh, and going on a planes raid with a few other barbs, ogres and trolls,
makes you appreciate shrink potions all the more.
