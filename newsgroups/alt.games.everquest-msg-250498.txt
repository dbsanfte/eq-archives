No maps available
Test server, when it's more deserted than normal.
Monk, without feign death yet.
Headed for Qeynos from Freeport, level 5.

9 deaths.

I got killed in Kithicor, Highpass hold, got told to go through runnyeye,
died 3 times there, got a sympathy port to North karana and got killed by a
griff before I finished loading, druid called me cursed and refused to port
me again, my corpse rotted (thankfully I was only carrying food and drink,
but at the time it was a lot of money in value to me). (Mind you at this
point I've not been able to get a bind anywhere; still bound in freeport.)
Die going through Kithicor in the day (No undead? Well there are dark
elves...)
Guards in Highpass save me as I join The Quon's purple club...
Hang around for 2 hours to get a bind (I'm not going to do that horrible
kithicor again).
Someone actually has a gnoll group going so I manage to get through the rest
of highpass relativly unscathed.
Got killed in one of the Karanas by some ogres that conned amiable to me
(wtf? Of course now I know better).
Now Entering North Qeynos...
Damn that's a big bug...

yes.. the queen bug was up, agro'd, and a running I went. I get to the
guards...

Join the purple club once again, oh well, at least they killed her.

You are bleeding to death
Pain and suffering strikes you....

Made it the last time without incident, though I was chased through half of
WK by a Hill Giant, he never hit me... some level 9 shaman gave me sow in
NK.

Hang around Qeynos looking for a bind, took a few hours.  Make pact with
fellow non binding class, he will beg in S.Q. and I in N.Q., whomever gets
bind will tell the other. He forgets, wizard that bound him had gated away
by the time I saw him running through N.Q. and queried him.

I'm sorry. Today, it's fun to walk places people normally port/book. But
back then that was a 6 hour session. Now, knowing what I'm getting into, I
could run a gnome, buffless and bindless from Ak'anon to Paineel. But I'm
much more experienced.
Yes the areas were awesome, but the frustration almost made me quit.. (as
this was pre kunark, obviously that little bit was quickly overcome.)

Next day, having spent an hour in BB getting rockin xp and loot...

A_RL_Friend_002 tells you, "Hey, want to come group with my Gnome
necromancer in steamfont?"

But that is another story...
