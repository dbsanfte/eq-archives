Its not his viewpoint that makes him a troll, it's the way he presents it.
Inflamatory subject line, nearly incoherent ranting at parts and within the
first paragraph he starts off with "shut up and admit it"...  I mean, give
me a break.   He's not inviting discussion, he wants to insult anyone who
might disagree with him and start a flame fest.

If he wants to have an actual discussion on "what went wrong with EQ"...
(and certainly, some things have gone wrong.) then I'm all for it.  He can
respond to my post and we'll go from there.  If not, if he just wants to
start a little war between the doomsayers and the fanboys, he can just fuck
off and go away.
