Greens won't work.  You can use your points with the guild master or
just start swinging a weapon of that type.  If your in an EXP group
and have no skill though, you would be hurting your group. 

To avoid the diservice to your group you could tell a group you want
skill ups with 1HB on their mobs.  A single ungrouped person with low
weapon skill should not outdamage a group; you will get skill ups and
they get more damage per second, so it is a win-win situation.  It is
even possible you may get an invite to the group if a member leaves.
