Using my pet to tank, there is a noticable difference.  Granted, this is
irrelavent because my solo-style doesn't have space for these spells except
in special circumstances.

Also, I would like to point out that Enchanters sometimes end up as "morale
officers" like Clerics or "party control" because of the unique range of
spells they posess.  To that end, if a party wants to see me slowing and
weakening, and they feel it is beneficial, I give them the option of trying
it out.  Sometimes it works really well, if only on a morale level.

This is something I tried to point out earlier in the thread:

Neither of us are particularly "wrong"; we have different play-styles.

You're a number-cruncher and an exp. churner.  That's fine.  I, on the other
hand, can live with being inefficient in the name of fun.  No, I'm not
saying you don't have fun -- you likely enjoy the game quite a lot, having
several high-level characters.

What I am saying is that not all of us play the game like a statistics
assignment.  I, for one, play it like a roleplaying game.

Who, for all the sarcasm, appreciates your point of view.
