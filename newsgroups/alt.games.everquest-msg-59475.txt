Or, as we often see before 30th level, a mediocre group that keeps me at
about 20-40 mana, speed pulls, and requires a brilliant Enchantress to keep
everything Mezzed, Tashed, Dotted, Weakened, etc. while the tanks get their
speed, the casters get their crack, and my pet just sort of sits there,
because I'm never hit. . .

It strikes me that there's more than one way to play a 'Chanter well, and
that just because you've got one at 60 and we disagree about your technique
doesn't mean that the rest of this NG is full of ravening morons.  8)
