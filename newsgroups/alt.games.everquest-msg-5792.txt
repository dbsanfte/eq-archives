I'll answer this one as at least it isn't upside down:

Research from Monkly Business:

"TravelerBoots
Increase Movement by 35
duration: 180 ticks(1080 secs)

Journeymanboots
Increase Movement by 35
duration: 180 ticks(1080 secs)

Spirit of wolf
Increase Movement by 34(lvl9) to 55(lvl50)
duration: 360 ticks(1260 secs)

Scale of wolf
Increase Movement by 57(lvl24) to 70(lvl50)
duration: 450 ticks(2700 secs)

Selo's Accelerando
Increase Movement by 20(lvl5) to 65(lvl50)
(but keep in mind using insturments helps speed it up even more)"


Doesn't dound like SOW to me...


They're also NODROP by the way, so no getting you local enchanter to
buy them for you.
