Unfortunately, this hides your corpse as well. The GM's that have responded
to my petition said it was not against the online play nice, be respective,
or even constituted a "causing grief" situation ... I didn't accept that and
went reading on Sony's website, and found a juicy little tidbit ... If
ANYTHING you do causes zone disruption, it IS something the gm has to look
at ... just do an /ooc Anyone else getting lagged out by <insert name>
corpses all around <insert .loc>  ... then do a /report on EVERY person that
says yes.   In 3 cases of me doing this, the GM cleared the corpses, and the
sad comic was nowhere to be found onlinef or days
