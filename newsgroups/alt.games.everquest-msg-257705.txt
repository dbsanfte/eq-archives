I was reading another preview (such as it can literally be called, since 
most game rag journalists haven't even had the opportunity to *see* it 
played, let alone actually play it themselves) on EQ2, and a few points 
they mentioned jumped out at me as I had not heard them before.

They said basically, and I'm paraphrasing here, that a player will have no 
more resources available to them during a fight than they had when the 
fight began. They didn't go into particulars, but they did mention that 
there will be no sitting to med during a fight. If the cleric runs out of 
mana (or power?), then they better get to swinging steel.

Another point mentioned was that killer trains will be a thing of the past. 
A mob, once aggro'ed on a player (or group), will not aggro on another 
player (or group) until after it has returned to its spawn point.

Further, killstealing may well be eliminated due to the fact that once a 
mob is engaged, no one other than the engaging party may do any damage to 
it unless the engaging party calls for help.

Some interesting points, I thought...
