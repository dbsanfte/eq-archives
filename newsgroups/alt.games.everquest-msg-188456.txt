Well, whether you lay the cash out, or use castoffs from a L55 character,
it's still twinking.

That will definitely get the skillups faster, since you are hitting faster.

You know this won't proc until long after you've (hopefully) replaced it
with something better right?

I'll have to see how my daughter's BST goes, she's only 14 or 15 now, which
is not bad for a very lightly twinked beastlord (gnomeskin and a little
coterie armor, PSU and shissar ulak), especially played exclusively by a 7
year old. I swear she levels faster than my 65 druid ever did (only recently
dinged 65 and hopefully never to ding anything non-AA again barring a 65+
level expansion).

I'd heard the pet had been nerfed and all the spells changed, have to see
how that affects things.

I've found that getting your ac buffed to a ridiculous level and having a
healer around lets you melee edge-reds (things that will be yellow on your
next ding) for a very good skill-up rate, while the healer can take over
fighting the mob if it becomes too much for the lower level toon. This is
mainly how I keep my froglok paladin at a level where I can duo with my
daughter, since when I am on my main she is busy levelling with other
friends.
