Oh c'mon Martin.  For the overwhelming majority of us the only way
we'll ever learn anything about ST is when you and Ben post about it.
"Uber"-Guild websites I've looked at seem invariably to have a dick-
waving to content ratio well over 1000 to 1.  Other than you two, most
posts here on the subject seem to rely on second-/third-/fourth-hand
information of questionable accuracy.  Even if we were in guilds that
might eventually be strong enough to go there, Kerafym is or will be
long since awakened.  If posting speculation and/or half-informed
opinions spurs you guys to post it's a good thing, IMO.
