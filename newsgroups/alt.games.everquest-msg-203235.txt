The problem you having is because every time that EQ is patched ZoneAlarm
thinks it is a new program. I know the program has the same name but the
size and such is different and ZoneAlarm knows this. This is a way to
protect from infections that would not change the name but add to the start
of your program and sooner or later cause you system problems. What you
should do is when going into EQ after a patch is the following (which is
what I do.)
*** Note Please Read all instruction first before trying ***
1) Open ZoneAlarm
2) Choose Program Control
3) Choice the Main tab
4) Set the Program Control to Low (this well put it into learn mode for
programs)
5) Start up EQ and log in your charter
6) While in EQ with your charter hit Alt + Enter to switch to window mode it
you don't play in Window mode
7) Press Alt + Shift + R (this well allow your cursor to be free of EQ and
let windows have cursor control again.
8) Now go to the ZoneAlarm window and set the Program Control back to the
setting you had it on before (Med or High)
9) Close the ZoneAlarm window
10) Click on the EQ window which makes the cursor work in EQ again
11) If you want to play EQ in Full Screen mode again than press Alt + Enter
Done and happy hunting
