Everything everyone said was good advice BUT I would bring a necro if
you can.  With a necro you can mow them down fast and actually get
good exp.  I had everything but a tunic and I was going crazy.  I then
asked a Necro that was LFG if he would help me and I would let him
have every drop except the druid armour and he said sure.  We were
dropping them 4X the rate of a single druid and probably 3X two
druids.

You could get a complete set in 10 pulls, be like me and have over 50
pulls or some people reported that they have been there weeks and
still not get a complete set.  That really means they did not get
there Tunic.  One reason it takes so long is because other druids are
now there trying to get drops and they might get the tunic pull.

Bring a necro.  There is no other class better suited to help you on
this camp.  55+ necro
