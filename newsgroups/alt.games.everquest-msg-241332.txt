}Do you understand what 'getting caned' was referring to in his post?

It generally refers to being smited about the nether regions with a stick.  
Clearly metaphorical, in this case, and also incorrect.  In the thread he 
referred to, a relatively civil conversation is had about the merits of 
top and bottom posting.  

}He was not saying that those NGs top posted, he meant that people were 
}not tied to a stake and burned alive for top posting, the way people are 
}on this NG.

Actually, he was saying that someone was tied to the stake and burned 
alive for bottom posting.  This, like so much else @ndrew has said about 
posting habits, proved to be bull.  They discussed it for about 24 posts, 
then agreed to disagree.

}Very good advice Zinph, being nice is better than charging in flames on 
}and gets a lot better response from people in getting them to do what 
}you want.

I do try to do that.  But being nice to everyone is a lot of work.  
Sometimes I just stand by and let someone else tell them, whether that 
someone else will be nice about it, or not.
