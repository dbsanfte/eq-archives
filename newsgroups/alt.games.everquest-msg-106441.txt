No way. I don't believe it. Unless those tanks had rusty weapons and
were lagged facing the wrong way half the time.

You 'might' and I mean 'might' be able to do 1/4 the damage of a Paladin
weilding 1hs.

Ah, this is your mistake. You do not get 'all' the hits of the other players.
The only way to get an accurate measure of all the damage done is
to parse the logs of all the characters individually from their own logs.
Then compare the results.

Ok this part may be worth it. 4 six second stuns saves a lot of damage
especially if there is no slower in the group.

Some stuns still work on some giants.
