From the shadows, the mysterious "Alexa" <xxlshirt@sbcglobal.net> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Not that I want to purchase, as I have a few mid 50's myself that suck up
>enough of my time, but do I understand you correctly that you want me to
>send you money blindly before you even verify you have the characters (won't
>show them in game until payment received in full).  You may be the most
>honest guy (or gal) in the world, but no way would I even think about buying
>that account with a proviso like that...basically send you a few hundred
>bucks on the outside chance I'll get what I purchased....good luck to you...

Notice he doesn't want to use anything that has guarantee secure
trading either, which if he scams them they get their money back.

There's not much reason to believe he's not a crook.

Considering he thinks he can still get away with the oft disproven
"buy my time" excuse that many banned accounts have tried, no one in
their right minds should pay this guy a cent.
