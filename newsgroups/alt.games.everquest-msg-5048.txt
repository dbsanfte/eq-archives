Well... not to make light of your situation, but honestly, was there
anything on your body that at level 10 would be crippling to you if
you lost?  Perhaps if you were twinked up quite a bit, this would be
understandable, but... to be quite honest, you'll have probably made
up more than your entire life savings up to level 10 within the next
three levels or so.

Wisps are wonderful things.
