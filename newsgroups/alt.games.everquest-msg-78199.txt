A good example can be trolls, or other evil races. Were generally KOS in 
all good cities, so we can not enter freeport. But in Freeport, the 
guards run on 2 different factions, one for the guards in EFP and WFP, 
and one for the ones in NFP.
The ones in EFP and WFP are corrupt, and the goodiegoodie paladins in 
NFP hate them for it. This mean you get NFP faction for killing WFP and 
EFP guards, and WFP and EFP faction for killing NFP guards.
So a troll that want access to the bank can just go kill the guards in 
EFP, WFP, EC, WC, and hell get NPF faction.
