Because the game is designed, except for raid encounters, around a
6-man group? Because the xp split would be ridiculously tiny with 2
more people to divide it up among? Because it wouldn't make much of a
difference at all? Because you don't *NEED* the "standard lineup" with
skill?

I hardly see what this has to do with anyone's sexual orientation, nor
how a company can have a sexual orientation. The employees, maybe, but
not the company itself.
