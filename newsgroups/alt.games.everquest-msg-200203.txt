firstly, you should try to bring either a ranger, rogue, wizard, or druid
with you, because snare/evac/damage is what your duo is missing

and a bard/enc wouldn't hurt either

secondly, it is generally empty

the zone can be a pain at times - a key is required from each level to
advance to the next....sometimes the key dropper doesn't spawn without
making you wait, and othertimes you'll be dead and on CR and have to wait a
while

ToFS is a fun zone the SECOND time you go, after you camped all the keys

other good alternatives would be droga/nurga, nagafen's lair, or crystal
caverns....though for dungeons like these,  3rd person who can provide
snare/high dps/ evac / mez would be very very useful, if not necessary
