Here's something I don't see mentioned much.

Target a mob, start mez, and leave it running

Target another mob, turn attack on.

Don't stop mez and mez will stay on the original target unless
you get interrupted.  As long as your songs stay greyed out you
are keeping that add under control, while contributing to the
melee takedown of the other mob.

Of course this means throwing away your twist, you could get two
or three other songs running while mezzing that add instead, so
you have to weigh the importance of your songs versus your melee
output.

It does make a nice break though, melee without twisting and yet
without guilt!

I think the same plan works with any targetted song, by the way,
its just that in most cases this fact isn't too interesting.  I
used to use this with the first bard charm, which can run
continuously, I'd keep charm on my pet and target other mobs to
order pet to attack.  Sadly the higher level charm doesn't work
this way, when its cast it turns itself off automatically.

For a more advanced version of this, charm one mob, have it "tank
mez" a second, and lock mez on a third while your party beats
down a fourth with your melee help.  Still "easy CC", hard is
keeping multiple mobs mezzed with short duration single target
mezzing.

Higher level mezzes, it should be noted, move your target away in
the direction you are facing, or opposite that direction (the one
I'm using now does this) so you have to be sure you don't move
mob into adds or out of mez range while concentrating on the
melee target.

But it wouldn't be barding if it was really -that- simple, would
it?
