Don't worry, it's REALLY REALLY easy.

If the pet does more than 50% damage IN ANY SITUATION, it takes a bunch of
experience.

That's really unlikely if you're grouped with even just one other person.

There's debate on how much xp he gets just by being there, but it's not
worth worrying about.  The number of fights per hour MORE you can fight WITH
the pet than without more than makes up for it.
