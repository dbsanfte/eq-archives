Antichrist will come from USA, will be charismatic new appointed leader of
Iraq and will broker peace which will turn into war, desecrate the temple,
etc. totally obvious to anyone. Israel is likely to fight like savage
cornered animals around this time and will do quite well for themselves
considering they are such a small country surrounded by all sides by
enemies. I am pretty sure they will take Iraq which will be useful I suppose
although I don't know why.

I'm getting kind of tired of the whole thing personally and would prefer to
be lounging on a beach somewhere with a beautiful woman drinking a mai tai
with a little umbrella in it.

I'm sure the US and English troops will be of some use although I dont know
how. That is one facet of the story I don't know.

well see you in a few days after making a little trip tonight.....
