Its nothing to do with technology. Its nothing to do with our ability to 
make a dream come true or not.

Middle Earth is one universe, Norrath is in another, FASA's Inner 
Sphere, and the Star Trek Federation is in still others. Who gives a 
crap if its *technically possible* to move assets, items, cash, 
characters, from a game modelling one universe to a game modelling the 
next?

It will remain a stupid thing to do.

Conceptually EQ is not a virtual reality inside our world -- even if 
that is what it is technologically. Conceptually it is its own world. 
The technology is irrelevant.
