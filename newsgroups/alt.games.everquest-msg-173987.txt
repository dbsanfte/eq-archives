There are presently 124 ground war hot spots in the world. 122 of them
involve muslims . The US has used its military several times in the last
decade and almost all of them have been to protect muslim people.

Step 1 ) stop protecting muslims.
Step 2) give aid and comfort to those groups already doing there best to
wipe out muslims.
step 3) Remove every country that is primarily muslim .

(ok so it would not exactly be easy and is most assuredly not what I
advocate and want but the Islamic faith as a religion could be destroyed as
any major factor)
