Thats probably a better approach, although I don't really see the difference,
if I made a new chat window and minimized it then I could forget about it just
as easily couldn't I?  And would -still- think everyone wasn't talking at all?

Would have been even worse if I'd grouped with just one partner, like Teapray
maybe, where we end up randomly spending half our time in tells and half in
group chat (plus occaisional mistells to the .age channel); I could do that for
days and not figure out why there were no Incoming messages.

Splendid

ps line wraps seem to be working with whatever you are using
