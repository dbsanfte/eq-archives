>>and hopefully your name<<

  You get to keep your name on one condition: that no one on the new server
has that name also.
I read through their policy on transfers, and though I haven't committed it
to memory, this is what I got out of it. If you transfer from one account on
one server to the same account on a different server, that's $50. You will
arrive naked, no equipment, no coins, nothing but your level and skills. If
someone else on your new server has the same name as you, an 'X' will be
placed behind your name. If you find an 'X' behind your name, you can
petition a GM to change your name, and the GM is supposed to change your
name with no further explanation necessary.

  If you transfer from one account on one server to a different account on
the SAME server, you get to keep all your equipment and coin, everything
stays the same, it's just the administrative stuff that changes. This costs
$50.

  I believe the second scenario came from complaints/suggestions about how a
husband/wife .. boyfriend/girlfriend .. siblings .. roommates .. started
with two different characters on the same account, then one of the two got
their own account and now they want to play together. The cost is just so VI
doesn't have to hire new people just to handle transfers. Which apparently
they will have to do anyway.
