ah quoting heinlein are ya? heres my favorite;

Throughout history, poverty is the normal condition of man. Advances which
permit this norm to be exceeded- here and there, now and then- are the work
of an extremely small minority, frequently despised, often condemned, and
almost always opposed by all right-thinking people. Whenever this tiny
minority is kept from creating, or (as sometimes happens) is driven out of a
society, the people then slip back into abject poverty.
This is known as "bad luck."


Reason and Ignorance, the opposites of each other, influence the great bulk
of mankind. If either of these can be rendered sufficiently extensive in a
country, the machinery of Government goes easily on. Reason obeys itself;
and Ignorance submits to whatever is dictated to it.
- Thomas Paine
