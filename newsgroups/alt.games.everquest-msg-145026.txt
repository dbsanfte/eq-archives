To me this seems strange and a little unfair, since all the other caster 
types either have a root/mez/snare to control this. Mages do have a pet 
which can root, but it will only root the mob its fighting so its very 
limited.

Even compared to the likes of a Monk, Rogue or Wizard? Wizard nukes are 
far superior to Mage nukes, and from what I've seen in game there's no 
way the Mage pet could compare to the damage output of a Monk, Rogue or 
even Warrior.
