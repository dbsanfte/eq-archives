Yep, at least one necro in our guild is kind of chaffing at being thought 
of as nothing but a mana pump.  Personally, I love having him along, that 
group lifetap rocks.  Damage the mobs, and heal me at the same time.  
Necro pet is awesome.  Need CC, necros have a mez of sorts.  Undead mobs, 
necro can fun spells for those.
