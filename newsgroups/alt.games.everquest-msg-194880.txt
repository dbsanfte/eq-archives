It's not true.  Last 3 Chardok royals raids I personally COHed my raid in.
My mage is dubious (borderline KOS, unfortunately).

What we did was COH to the hall at the top of the ramp right outside the
King room.  On the KING side of the fake wall.

There are 5 roamers but if your mage is talented, he can time it so you
should be able to get at least 2 people in before the first critter is in
aggro range.  The order that we always used was:

Enchanter: mezz roamers that show up
Healer: keeps the enchanter alive
High DPS (ranger usually): engage the first critters
Everyone Else.

It's important NOT TO BE IN RAID FUNCTION until you are all down there.  It
is EXTREMELY confusing to have to leave raid, find your group leader, get
grouped, and get re-reinvited into the raid.

This is what we found to be easiest:

Create groups at zone in.  Get grouped and get buffed.
DISBAND
COH anchor invites folks into the COH group, and they do it in
group-by-group order, COHing the groupleader first.   Everyone else is
simply told to disband when they get there and go looking for the group
leader.

The raid leader IS COHed near the start so that he/she can invite the group
leaders as they're COHed and ready.
