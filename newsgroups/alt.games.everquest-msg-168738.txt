I'm not a stalking dick.  You won't find a single reference to me
stalking anyone except for when bizbee makes that claim. I've posted
the facts before regarding bizbee and his "stalkers" and I'll present
it again if I have to, not that anyone cares.

On the other hand, check google and see how many hits something like
bizbee and drake, or bizbee and Richard G, or bizbee and peace and
happiness, or bizbee and taco, or bizbee and red celt, or bizbee and
madbomma and look at the results on bizbee who is doing the stalking. 
That's the short list btw.

It doesn't matter if anyone likes somebody or not, that's what
killfiles are for,  the point is that bizbee will stalk someone and
then claim they are stalking him.  He's posted peoples names and
addresses and phone numbers and asked "everyone" to call them.  Hell,
just find out for yourself by taking 15 minutes query bizbee on
Google.
