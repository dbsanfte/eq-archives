Ribbon cables can defeat the best efforts of your fans.  :T  Ideally, you 
should be able to look in your intake fan and see your exhaust fan, with 
very little occlusion.  IDE stuff isn't usually too bad, with a well-
designed mobo, but SCSI cables can be killers, since they arc over the 
entire board to the PCI card section.  Still, the more open are you have in 
your case, the better.

Definitely, though I haven't found the cupboard thing to be too bad, given 
front intakes and a bit of clearance in the back for exhaust to escape.  
Nearby radiators, though, are bad.  My particular setup has a lighting 
fixture on the wall above it, and the heat from -that- is enough to raise 
the temperature a couple of degrees.  These setups are volatile.
