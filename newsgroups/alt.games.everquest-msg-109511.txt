Mages do.  Necromancers don't.  Necromancers feed a miniscule amount, 
since there is no way to store it.  A mage can give a cleric 3-4 times as 
much mana as they have normally (with proper mod-rod transfers).  A necro 
can give less than their own mana pool.  Not even close.  They are both 
only useful on raids that stress cleric mana, and not that many before the 
true end-game mobs do that.

I would say that an SK is a BETTER off-tank than a Pally.  They get aggro 
faster, and can keep it.  We sometimes farm ToV armor drops with an SK as 
MT.  We NEVER have to worry about him losing aggro, so can do it with a 
twinkie cleric.
