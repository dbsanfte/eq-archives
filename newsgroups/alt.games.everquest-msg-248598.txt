The solid color and the blue bar are working for all of the files *prior* to
EQLS_window_pieces_02.tga. That file has never existed in the Everquest
folder... EQLS_window_pieces_01.tga is there but not 02. I never had to
delete it because it was never there in the first place, so perhaps that's a
clue.
