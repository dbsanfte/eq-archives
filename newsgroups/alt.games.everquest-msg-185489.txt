As noted in my original post, I do use mem blur. Actually Blanket of
Forgetfulness.

The 12th level spell Memory Blur does suck and typically requires two
or three castings to take effect. Unfortunately, there's no indication
of whether it worked or not, so you do have to cast it three times on
a single mob to be "sure".

Blanked of Forgetfulness, however, works great. A single casting
almost always works. It does have to be used with care, though. If it
lands just before the Cleric's CH on the main tank, the Cleric will
find himself with a new friend. I learned this the hard way (well,
hard for the Cleric). I landed BoF on a group of mezzed mobs (after
slow, debuff, and what not). During the fight with the one awake mob,
the Cleric cast a CH on the main tank. When that fight was done, the
MT broke mez on the next mob and he made a bee line for the Cleric.
Had the Cleric lived, it would have been pretty funny.

Now I pay very close attention to when and what the Cleric is casting.
BoF should land just after a big heal by the Cleric. And naturally
after slows and other debuffs by other party members. (Note to other
debuffers: Always social your slows / debuffs so the Enchanter (or
Cleric) knows when to mem blur (or Atone if Cleric)).

BoF is a lifesaver - literally. Casting both mez and slow on a mob
really pisses it off. Often even two or three taunts by the MT is not
enough to distract it. With BoF, I almost never get aggro after mez
breaks.

When soloing, root (or mez) / pacify / mem blur is quite handy for
adds. When root breaks, the mob will just go on his way.
