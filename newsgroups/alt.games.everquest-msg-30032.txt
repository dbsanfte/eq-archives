I'll take a stab at it.  I don't know about different mobs for certain, but
I believe that yes, different mobs may have larger or smaller effects on
faction.  Different quests may have different values of faction change.  I
don't recall the details, but they are available in older posts to this ng
if you do a search.  AFAIK, no particular faction is more or less resistant
to change, it just may be harder to find good quests/mobs to affect that
particular faction.  I believe that all factions behave essentially the
same, ie, given the same faction value in different factions, NPCs on those
factions will con the same to you (not levelwise, factionwise).
