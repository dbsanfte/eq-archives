Cleric fighting ability maxes out way below that of melee and hybrid
classes. If you're over level 20 or so, don't expect to see a lot of
combat until you hit level 56 and get Yaulp V and your proccing hammer,
as until that your melee damage output will only ever get worse, and
your combat-related skills max out at a fairly low level.

Basically most of the rest of your clericking career will be sit to
med, stand to heal, sit down again. There are variations on this
(root/nuke for soloing, root/atone/lull and stun for crowd control)
but most of the variety in your game will be in healing strategies.
Your group members will not be looking to you to contribute damage,
but to keep them alive.

I'm probably making this sound a little worse than it is. Healing
can be challenging, and satisfying. But basically my advice is to
let go of your melee role because not only will you only get worse
at it with time, but the time will come when fellow players will
think you to be a poor cleric *because* you do not focus solely on
healing.
