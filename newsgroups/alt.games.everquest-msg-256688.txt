The only way I could see it working was if it was a very small guild, who
only raided once in a blue moon and cared little about advancement through
the various raid "levels"

For any kind of a serious raiding force, /random systems are "the debil."
They just don't work.


(I could go into detail on why, but I've done so repeatedly in the past, so
I won't bore you guys unless someone actually wants to hear it.... If anyone
does, I'm more than willing to discuss it with them.)
