Well Welcome to Everquest Shierra, and to the newsgroup too.  While I don't
play on your server as of yet, I'm sure I will eventually.  I have
characters all over the place.  It's good to see someone new to the game
doing quests, and taking time and paying attention to the npcs and what they
say.

If you ever have questions ask here, and have fun playing the game if you
ever find yourself getting frustrated just turn off the game for a while and
go do something else most seem to forget that.

Have fun with your Kitty Cat Beastie


Sedce Frozentears, 57 (soon to be 58 /cry) Shaman, Terris Thule
and many others spread across many servers.
