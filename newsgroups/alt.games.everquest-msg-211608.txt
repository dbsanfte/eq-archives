Yeah. There is *no* excuse for not waiting at this point.Its a much 
better value. Its almost literally works out to getting paid well over 
60 or 70 bucks to wait a couple weeks. Spend the 70 bucks you save on 
something else, and pick up EQ in a couple weeks... its not going anywhere.

And its only a waste of $198.00 if it turns out he doesn't like it after 
a couple months (it does happen!)... I wouldn't buy more than three 
months for a first stretch.

Maybe. I wouldn't worry overmuch about deity selection as a new 
player... unless he PLs all the gear you currently drool over will be 
obsolete before he gets there... and who knows what the future will 
bring... perhaps Warriors of RZek will get the sweet stuff...
