It is also fixable. Outer guard faction is first. If you want, try
mass Halfling killing. Indigo can be fixed with mass Wood elf killing
(Tim Deep, or Crush).

If you dont care for killing, invis up into the Library and turn in
cases and cases of red wine. Lokar is charmable, at low level even.
Once you get the first few bottles in him, he warms up to you, and
accepts more without help. You can also get Leatherfoot raider
skullcaps and turn them in at the Warrior guild.

Finally, you can suck it up, know your home is gone, and live in the
PoK or Luclin. Faction isn't as hard as it was at one time. I remember
an Iksar I had, who had to go to Cabilis for almost everything until
my Freeport faction was out of scowling. When Luclin came out, it was
a big relief. When PoP came out, I ran a Iksar Necro, without ANY
faction work anywhere but Cabilis.
