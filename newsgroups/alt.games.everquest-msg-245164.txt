IFS, if you can find one, is a nice 38/40 2HB that I don't think has a
recommended lvl. There's also an easy to get 2hb that drops in solC,
don't recall if it has a recommended lvl but a group of 50s should be
able to get one in an hour or so. 

As for 1hb, I'd go with a Jade Mace and SoS, should be able to get
them for around 3k total and they'd up your damage by about 50% from
the Ulaks.
