Go talk to the ancient greeks.  They had tons of slaves, and they
didn't bother with stupid criteria like race.  Enslave one of them and
they'd probably not like it, but I doubt they'd call it evil.

And there have been entire cultures that saw cannibalism as a
legitimate practice.  And, I doubt they'd see it as evil, even if they
were dinner.  

And a nitpick, Ted Bundy was a rapist/murderer.  Jeffery Dalmer(sp?)
was the cannibal.

I'm sure that there are people convicted of crimes and sent to jail
see incarceration as evil.  Does that make it so?

When push comes to shove, good/evil are purely intellectual concepts.
Animals don't seem to worry too much about good vs. evil.
