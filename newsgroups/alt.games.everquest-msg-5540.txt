Wow, the entire world is a free country now? What a wonderful
occourance. When did it happen? Dang, I need to stay caught up on
world news more...

(Rant on. In case you hadn't noticed, this was a dig at the
overwhelming egocentralism of many Americans. I am proud to be an
American, but ashamed that many of us cannot seem to look beyond our
borders. The internet is international, and as such, not subject to
local laws or mores. Your country may be free, but it is arrogance to
assume that anyone who reads this will be American, or subject to our
rights. Rant off.)
