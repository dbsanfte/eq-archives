Heh, I feel the same way about the endless CIHYS posts.

It's one of those things that just rubs me the wrong way, is trivial
to fix and just annoys me to no end as a programmer. There's a part of
me that figures if you complain about it long enough, they'll catch a
clue. Hey, it's been known to happen, even with SOE! <g>

Apologies for my last post though, your reply was a lot more civil
than I deserved.
