Up to 30th level I thought clerics were a great asset to any group.  My main
character is a Halfling cleric (now 31st level).  Then while fighting at the
fort in Frontier Mountains, I grouped up with a shaman and in discussing
things, it turned out that I out-nuked them.  With Wrath I did 200 dam and I
forget what they did but it was quite a bit less.  Then for the first time
in the game, I became a back-up healer to a non-cleric.  We rolled.  Very
little downtime.  I saw the shammy cannibalizing himself to get mana when a
pull went bad.  I could take out basically every other giant with my nukes
and still have 50m left over for being back-up healer.  Only occasionally
did I need to be back-up healer on really bad trains.  Seeing how effective
the shammy was at being a group healer, I came here and inquired more about
this.  That thread is "Are shamans better group healers than clerics?"  It
was and still is quite an eye-opening thread.

Now I question my cleric's value to groups.  If Sang is correct (even though
he has the tact of a crude brothel bouncer), the reason clerics are the most
wanted class is because of a misunderstanding.  A better class at keeping a
pre-50 group alive (note I didn't say healing) would go to the shammy with
their line of slow spells.  But shammies are only good until they hit 50th
level and then supposedly magical resistance (MR) rises high on mobs that
make the shammy less effective, if not worthless.  Only after 50th level do
cleric start pulling their weight.  But even here that is debatable.  Sure,
clerics can do XP rezzes, but you'd only need one such XP rez cleric in a
zone or even a neighboring zone to cover that aspect.  Sure, it might cost
you 400 pp for a rez from a non-grouped-with cleric, but mobs you're
fighting aren't dropping chump change then either.  Complete Heal then seems
to be the clerics only real contribution to any group.  One spell.  Like a
one-trick horse.  Just don't know if all the effort to get to 50th level is
worth it just to be a one-trick horse.  Just don't know.

I would appreciate high-level clerics tossing their two cents in here.  Are
clerics worth playing?  Are they really of value to groups?  Pre-50 and
post-50.  I'm sure Sang will join in and I actually hope he does.  I
strongly dislike doing anything out of ignorance and have always wanted to
know the truth.  It would be a shame to bench my cleric, but it would be a
greater shame to keep investing time into a class that doesn't pull its
weight until a high level and then being a one-trick horse after that.
