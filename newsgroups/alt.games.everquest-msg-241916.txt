On my computer, DX9 --->IS WORKING<--.
It's the 'other' stuff , that I suppose was part of the recent change,
where my vid card is not supported.
I didn't follow every EQ tech board message.
.........
......................timeline.............
this is my recollection.
dx9 warning issued.
elsewhere (non-EQ) , chat is that DX9 will work for me
SOE long term contract offered
'dx9' changeover
I successfully install dx9
EQ still does not work..
......................................................
How would you feel?
It is the curious timing of the one-year contract,
that, I suggest, is questionable.
Also, IMO, that SOE is co-promoting vid cards,  looks bad.
