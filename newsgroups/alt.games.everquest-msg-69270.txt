I had been dragging my feet on buying more memory for my computer, now
that Luclin had such huge requirements it gave me a push to go out and
get the memory.

setup
amd 1.3 tbird
256MB 2100 ddram(now 750MB)
geforce 3 ti200
sb audology
20 gig hd

Game was very choppy and zone times were impossible 5 to 10 minutes on
the extreme end, to the pont where i didnt play. Even when I had many
video options turned off

With 750MB of ram all options are on runninf at 1600x1200 works smooth
as silk, zone times seems to be even better than pre luclin now.

I realzie the requirements are pretty steep but the ram only cost me
$100 so it wasn't a huge investment for me
