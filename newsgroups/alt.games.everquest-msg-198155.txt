    I'm sorry, but the cleric on another server whom we pooled data with to
reach the conclusion asked that the results be kept confidential. However,
if you ask around on EQClerics I bet someone there would spill the beans -

plain ugly, you should be able to reach it with a SHM, ENC, or BRD in the
group. :-)
