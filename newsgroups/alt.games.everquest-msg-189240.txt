Right, because actually being able to take a few hits makes it so much
harder to keep mobs locked down. I mean, after all, not being a robe-wearing
INT caster makes AC -so- challenging. Especially when you get a mezz resist
and are trying to get a mezz off through a mob hitting you for 200+ points
of damage with each swing.

Yep, Encs sure have it easy.

I wonder how high-level you've actually gotten, to say that AOE stun really
makes our job any easier?
