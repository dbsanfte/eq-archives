Sorry, but I don't buy that. The thing that has deterred the USSR for 
the duration of the cold war (in case any deterrant had actually been 
necessary) was MAD. That works as well now as it did then. Missile 
Defence adds nothing of any significance to it.

In this case, I'm for once inclined to believe the Pentagon's line that 
Missile Defence is actually intended to stop a lone missile, or a small 
volley of them, from a rogue state. What I don't believe for a second is 
that any rogue state would consider a missile attack a cost-effective 
way to get back at the US.

I don't know. I can think of dozens of better delivery vectors for a 
single warhead than a crap Russian missile from the 1960's. If we were 
talking about a couple of thousand warheads, yes. But one? A missile 
doesn't make any sense.
