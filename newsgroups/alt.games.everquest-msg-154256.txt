In addition, mobs who cast ae feign death, ae charm (so your warrior has no
agro and casters are going to get pwnt)

Also on HP, hybrids lower damage *and more importantly* the ability to build
agro without doing damage, is, in my opinion, what this fight was designed
around

Shei.. learn the fight yourself, I wont spoil it :)  but hybrids are crucial
here
