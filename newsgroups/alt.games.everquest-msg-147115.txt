Hi everyone,

I was wondering if someone can help out by answering a question for me.  Due
to personal circumstances, I have to leave for a while and will not be
playing everquest for a few months.  Now I have a close friend that I
wouldn't mind letting him play my character (im thinking that i won't come
back before my account expires anyway). But my situation is, I have my
account to be billed to my credit card. Now if I end billing and my friend
plays.. is it something that he can just hit continue billing? I trust him
but not that much lol.. I don't mind him having my char, but I don't want to
pay when it expires.

So i'm wondering if there is anyway around this?

And this is an honest post.. i'm not trying to steal an account or
anything..

Thanks

steph
