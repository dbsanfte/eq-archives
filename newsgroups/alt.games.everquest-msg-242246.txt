They said they were going to take a while to fix it so not all zones
have the same sky, and they haven't mentioned fixing it that I can
recall.  I haven't actually been to Luclin in a while, though, so for
all I know they may have fixed it and just not mentioned it.  But they
have at least indicated that they know it's a problem.

There are much worse problems to fix right now, though...
