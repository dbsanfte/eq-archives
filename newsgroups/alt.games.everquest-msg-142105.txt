So educate me . Take your best shot :p

Ill offer up a couple of facts for you and kaev. They can be checked by
yourselves if you care to.

The war of independence, that bought us a country with blood ,was fought
over taxation. That taxation rate was 2 and half percent.

When the original subject of an income tax came up in congress there was a
strong movement to write into law a max that could ever be levied. That max
was going to be 2 and a half percent for the above historical reason. The
principal argument used to shoot down this ammendment was that the people
gathered wanted to make it absolutely plain that 2 and half percent was FAR
to large of a figure and if they wrote it into law later lawmakers might
consider this 2 and a half percent tax to be somehow allowable.

The one and proper role of goverment is to secure the rights of the people
and provide for the common defense, whenever it does more than this it
becomes an evil.

I most certainly was quoting someone kaev . Can you perhaps tell me who?
