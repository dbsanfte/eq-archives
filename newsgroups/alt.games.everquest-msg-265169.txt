No, no, no...it's even funnier w/the right quote, "I and I be the
Rasta-

ALL of his books have been good, but "The Straylight Run" in Neuro-
mancer blew me away the first time I read it.  He just makes it sound
so realistic, and you can actually imagine the logos for Disony
(Disney +
Sony multi-nat) and get buzzed on Case's dope :-).

Sorry to be off-topic, found a copy of the PC game online, and will
try
it out this weekend.
