 Yeah.. well you want to try guessing how much plat and loot I'm
going to get getting that XP back? I'm not bitching about losing
XP. Deaths and XP loss happens whether you like it or not. Even
the most careful player is going to die occasionally due to events
beyond his or her control. It's part of the game. And frankly,
after level 51 it's just no use -trying- to level up. There's a 
reason WHY every level from 51 on up is a hell level. That being
it lengthens the time you can play your particular character
rather than just speeding your way to level 60 in a few weeks.
 
 Tell me, just what do YOU plan to do with your character if and
when you attain level 60? My bet is that you will stop playing 
it as much if not entirely. Either that or you'll start farming
and selling items.
 
 I'm not really looking forward to hitting 60 (or filling the
yellows IN 60). And I'm not on the XP treadmill I once was in 
my 20s, 30s and 40s. I'm doing quests, learning trades, exploring
zones I've never been to before, cultivating new friendships (I
recently got married in-game and boy oh boy does that really add
a new and pleasurable dimension to the game), working on my Epic
Quest, and generally smelling the roses on the way up and I'm really, 
really, not in a hurry to get to any particular level.
 
 Sure, I'm still looking forward to the new spells I'll get to
use as I attain a new level but frankly I'm happy just where I
am. I can play the game just fine without those spells I can't 
use yet.
 
 One other thing... those places everybody dreams of going to such
as the planes? Don't expect to get ANY XP there at all. Go in 
EXPECTING TO COME OUT WITH LESS XP. High level zones are not about
gaining experience. Sure you normally get XP if not on a raid but
the main thing is doing NEW THINGS, going to NEW PLACES and getting
NICE GEAR to wear or sell (if not no drop) as you wish. And don't
Forget about those Epic Quests. If you think your going to get XP
doing your Epic... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!
 
 This wonderful game called EQ is not all about XP. XP and gaining
levels is a by-product of "doing things", but not necessarily ALL 
things in EQ.  
  
 That's the way it is and I for one like it that way. Better get 
used to it.
