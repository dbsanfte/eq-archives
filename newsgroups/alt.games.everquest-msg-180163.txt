Hell, what you talk about already exists in small pockets against
Erudites and Dark Elves (I've heard the term "Nigger elves" more than
once used in referrence to the DE's. Almost the same minues a word in
referrence to Erudites). Of course, it's inevitable that the idiots
would find some way to work in their bigotry no matter what. On the up
side, I've yet to see it go so far as motivating the idiots to deny
these people groups.
