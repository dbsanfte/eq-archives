Look around and find a group of Ogres camped just
below the mountain base.

This is located in the northern hemisphere of the zone.

Approach the Chief Ogre making sure to con the guards
to know they will not attack you.  Give the Chief 3 Fire
beetle eyes and 1 Lambent stone.   He will then proceed
to open a gate to the secret Tree level.  The rest is
self explanatory
