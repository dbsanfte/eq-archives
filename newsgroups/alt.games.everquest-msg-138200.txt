Well, considering that most General attempts on E. Marr end up as
zerg rushes, it wouldn't hurt...especially if he just sneak/hid around.

Nothing in the cabin or any of the undead (at night) see through
sneak/hide...although there IS always the possiblity of a high-level
mob seeing through a lower level rogue's ability.

But I seriously doubt that a 34 rogue would be higher on the hate
list than the MT or anybody healing the MT.  Even if that rogue IS
sporting some new gear and a bit of haste...
