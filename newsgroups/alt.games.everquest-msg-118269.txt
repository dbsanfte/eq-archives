You guys reminded and inspired me to post about one brief experience I
had in Great Divide on Sunday.  You're going to love this, given the
history of stories here about interactions between druids/wizards and
people looking for ports.

The Scene: My wizard is sitting up on a safe spot on a ledge in GD
recovering mana from the last really ugly, manasapping quad gone bad. A
/tell arrives for me.

Assassin_01:  Hey, need a TL to Toxx to meet my raid party. I'll give
you fifty plat.

Me: Sorry, I don't get TL's for two more levels. Good journies.

Assassin_01: Doesn't matter if it's a TL or a port, just need to get to
Toxx. I'm at the dragon ring. I'll make it 100 plat. Come on.

Me: I'm completely OOM at the moment, and I'm sort of on a good camp so
I'm not porting right now, sorry. I'd TL you if I could but I dont' have
the spell yet. 

[Ok... here it comes. Get ready for the kicker.]

Assassin_01:  Oh, that's just great. Ya know, if you Wizards don't want
to bother porting anybody, you could at least make the effort to go
anonymous.

My wife had to rescue me from nearly choking.  This was an instant
classic.
