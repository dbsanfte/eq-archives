Death Pact?  Hell no, that sucker is useless.  But Symbol?  Yes...and I'm
insisting the cleric get enough money to cover the reagent cost (whether I
give them 'dots or we give them trash gems/jewelry).  I'm also insisting
that we not make the cleric rich after he stocks up on 'dots he used during
guild hunts while I remain broke.

Clerics are entitled to make up for spent 'dots.  I don't want them losing
money over time from my hunts with that cleric.  If the last time the guild
hunted with him he lost 200p in 'dots then I have no problem with him taking
200p off the top of today's guild hunt before splitting the rest.

Clerics are entitled to their fair amount of the remaining loot.  I don't
want them taking MY share of the remaining loot.
