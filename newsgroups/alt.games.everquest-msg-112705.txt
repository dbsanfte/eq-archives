I just started an Enchantress and I got her to level 6 faster than I could
afford my level 1 spells.  Now, not only an I behind on buying spells, but
my (spell) skill levels are totally inadequate for my level.

I can't twink, as I have no characters above level 11, so going somewhere to
get cash to pass down isn't an option.

Am I just missing something or does anyone else think that maybe instead of
just the two spells to start with, casters should be given ALL their level
one spells now?  Seriously, how can one afford reagents, armor and spells
when you can level faster than it takes to regain a full bar of mana?

If it makes any difference, I went with Dark Elf for race.

Thanks for reading my small rant.
