I don't recall really, was there really a vote on whether they should
start the Legends service? Are you sure they weren't just checking how
many customers would be interested in the service?

The fact that most players weren't interested in Legends is totally
irrelevant if there are enough for it to be profitable, and I don't see
how disregarding the majority of us who happily stayed with the normal
EQ service were affected by it. Letting us vote on whether Sony should
start a server for other people would be retarded. Of course the
majority view didn't matter. Selling gear and characters for RL cash
will however affect all of us who voted no, so there is a reason for
Sony to listen to us, and there isn't a precedence saying they won't.

I'm not saying there's no chance that they will ignore the results of the
poll, but I don't think you should take it as given. It's quite possible
that they were actually asking us because they wanted to know our opinion.
