   Indeed.  And so far, we're doing good.  I have good feelings about
the long term effects of this one.  Anyways, I don't have a lot of faith
in the "You're put alot of effort into the character, so don't dare
reroll because you might regret it later!" theory.  While it is
certainly true that it could work out that way, I think it is it truer
that if you are playing a character that you are finding less and less
enjoyable to play for whatever reason, then it isn't going to magically
get better as you sink more time into it.  This is certainly true with
Lenny.  We had this very discussion 3 months ago, and he decided that
because of the faction work he had done, he would rather stick with his
warrior.  But he just got more and more unhappy the farther the
character progressed.  

   There is a danger of the "grass is always greener on the other side"
effect going on, of course, but I think this was a pretty well informed 
decision.
