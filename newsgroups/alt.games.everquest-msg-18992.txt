Doable, but  you'll have more fun if you bring more people.  Crowd
control will be your biggest problem with just a two man team.  Cleric
gonna get whacked a bit trying to root park extras and you can only tank
so many at a time before he's gonna use all his mana on heals, so either
route is less than desired.  See if you can add an evacer and an
enchanter and you are on to something.  

Done a lot of raiding there over the levels, solo some, two shaman the
first few times back when V first opened and later a lot of raids with
two shaman, a cleric and a warrior, tossing in a druid, enchanter and or
a rogue on some trips.  Good times, not the worst loot, but ugly corpse
runs if someone with a key doesn't get out and you leave corpses behind.
