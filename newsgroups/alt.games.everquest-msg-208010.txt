You're absolutely right, Frank.  And maybe it's better on Bristlebane, I
certainly hope so.  But on Xegony - the upper tier guilds refer to guilds
working their way up (such as mine) as 'feeder guilds' and will occasionally
troll their message boards looking for their outstanding members and problem
children, so they know who to invite or avoid.  Please note - I don't LIKE
it.  But it's not my world to alter, just to live in.
