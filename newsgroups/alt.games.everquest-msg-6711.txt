There never was a set upper range limit.

If indifferent starts at "0", then anything above 750 was
"warmly", but you could go up "warmly" indefinitely (except
that there's a cap of 2000 points over your base for a given
faction (which is determined by your race/religion/class).

So apparently now instead of "warmly" being "750 to infinity",
it's now, say, 750-999, and 1000-infinity would be classed as
"allied".

Thus, people will very "warmly" faction will instantly see
themselves as "allied" as soon as they log in and /con
something.
