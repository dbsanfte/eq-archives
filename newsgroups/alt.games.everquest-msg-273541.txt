The "red wine guy" is a merchant. All merchants have a special tweak so
that regardless of your actual faction with them, they never con worse
than apprehensive. [Note that merchants will sell to you only after you're
*really* apprehensive or better] This doesn't affect any faction level
required for quests they participate, it only makes it so they won't agro
on you if you're normally KOS. You can see this in action in those places
where there are merchant and non-merchant mobs on the same faction. The
merchants are never worse than apprehensive, even if you're KOS to the
nonmerchants.  Cabilis for sure, but I believe OT outpost, Thurgadin,
Shadowhaven, or Runnyeye even should show this as well.

Anyway, even though you appear to be apprehensive to him, you're likely
dubious (or worse). And as I recall, with this particular quest, you
probably need indifferent or better to do the quest. If you're a bard,
enchanter, or have sneak, use that. If you don't have those, you'll need
a second person to invis you after you've opened the Trade window with the
merchant in order to be indifferent for the quest turn in.

Note that the faction hits for this turn in are *huge* for Dark Bargainers.
You should be able to do the turn in without invis after only a stack or
2 of wine. You'll get to max ally in less than 2 backpacks, as I recall.

Can't explain the giving it back part though. Perhaps you were giving it
to the wrong guy. Or maybe it's a stealth tweak so that if you don't meet
the faction/class/level requirements for the quest they no longer eat the
quest items any more. We could only dream! :)
