When the expansion first comes out there'll be a lot of new cats.  Those who
hate overswamped newbie zones but like to check out new things (uberguilds &
map makers primarily, but still plenty of adventurous folks) will be
checking out the new landscape.

And getting the new loot that Verant will undoubtedly realize is unbalancing
and remove a few weeks later (except for the folks who already have it).

Mostly everyone else will stay in the current zones until the new maps come
out.

The Old World population was eventually traumatized by Kunark.  Velious has
always been an upper level playground where the uberguilds hang out and stay
out of our way. :)  I think that The Old World will be most affected by SoL.
Pretty much Strike Three for SolB & LGuk.  Permafrost was lost long ago
(though with the new druid port...?)
