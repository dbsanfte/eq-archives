There are a couple notable dinosaur bone hunter guys, one of them
quite famous, who are a bit on the fringe who advanced this theory (of
dinosaurs being warm blooded) Its pretty valid really and its based on
the fact that they are really quite bird like (of course as you know,
bird and dinosaurs have a lot in common.. especially that prehistoric
dinosaur like bird thing with feathers) and have something called
"hasavarian" canals or something like that in the bones. I don't
remember the guys exact research on this but the canals suggest a much
faster growing warm blooded creature like a bird while not suggesting
something like a cold blooded reptile. I read the book by one such guy
quite a few years ago and it really impressed me and made it think it
was possible they were warm blooded or at least not fully cold blooded
like reptiles today: 

Okay, now its research time, I bet I can find the guys name and the
particular book in 10 seconds or less with hotbot:

Oops, i was wrong, 5 seconds, guess what search I used? Not that hard
really (dinosaur warm blooded):

Hot-Blooded or Cold-Blooded?? Back in 1968, Robert T. Bakker, a young
aspiring paleontologist finishing an undergraduate education at Yale,
wrote a brief article, "The Superiority of Dinosaurs&qu
7/2/2001 http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/metabolism.html

"1. Dinosaurs like T. rex and Diplodocus were not mammals. They were
not birds. There are significant differences between these groups.
Since we have no dinosaurs alive today (except for birds, which have
about 145 million years of evolutionary separation from non-avian
dinosaurs), it is hard to compare them with anything living whose
metabolism we understand. 
2. We are only now beginning to understand living mammal and bird
metabolism. Understanding dinosaur metabolism is complicated by our
lack of knowledge of modern animal metabolism. 

3. The issue is a tangled, complex one. There are not just two sides
to the issue; there are numerous competing hypotheses. If you're
looking for a major controversy in science, look no further! "

Found something about the bone part here:

"10. Given: Dinosaur bone is more similar to mammalian or avian (bird)
bone in cross section than it is to typical ectothermic "reptilian"
bone. Hypothesis: This bone structure similarity shows that dinosaurs
were endothermic. Problem: Some of the best evidence for endothermy
yet, but still has its faults. Bone structure does vary a lot
throughout the life of an individual, at different sizes, and under
different conditions. Bone that is similar in structure to bone of an
endotherm has not been established to always be bone of an endotherm.
Several researchers associated with the UCMP have been working on
dinosaur bone histology (the thin-sectioning of bone to see its
structure). The results are inconclusive so far, but have shown that
many dinosaurs had rapid growth rates on a par with those of modern
endotherms."

"A Current Cladogram Suggests that Feathers Evolved for Insulation, T.
rex had Feathers, and the 
Question of Warm-blooded Dinosaurs is Not "If" but "When." 

The actual book I read was by baker. He is looked upon as a kind of
quack by some people in his field but its an ongoing interesting
debate. Really the consensus is:

They will never know. There are valid arguements on both sides but no
reptilian creatures that large with similar structures today to study.
We have modern alligators or crocs but they are built QUITE
differently from the two legged dinos like T rex who were built for
speed (which is also part of the warm blooded arguement) There are
also no modern reptiles with feathers so no example of cold blooded
feathered creatures which are reptile like, or warm blooded for that
matter.

More summary:

http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/summarythermy.html

"Top Five Current Hypotheses

1. Dinosaurs were complete endotherms, just like birds, their
descendants.


2. Some or all dinosaurs had some intermediate type of physiology
between endothermy and ectothermy.


3. We know too little about dinosaurs to hazard a guess at what their
physiology was like.


4. Dinosaurs were mostly inertial homeotherms; they were ectothermic
but maintained a constant body temperature by growing large. Small
dinosaurs were typical ectotherms, maybe with a slightly elevated
metabolic rate.


5. All dinosaurs were simple ectotherms, enjoying the warm Mesozoic
climate. But that's okay; many ectotherms are quite active, so
dinosaurs could be active, too."


Both 2 and 3 are what they say a lot now. Dinosaurs may have been
something totally different basically.
