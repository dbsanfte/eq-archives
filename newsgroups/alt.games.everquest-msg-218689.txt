DROP THE FUCKING LINE ABOUT THE SPILL! Inserting the spill into the
comparison invalidates it. PERIOD. We're talking about someone walking
on a bad leg. Nowhere have I said anything about him slipping in a
spill. Just walking on it. END OF FUCKING STORY. But you keep
inserting this spill into the story. What, can't counter my argument
as it is, you have to keep putting extra lines in?

Once again: The story of the kid is like walking into a theater on a
bad leg improperly and thus, simply by walking on it, making it worse,
then trying to blame the theater. No spills, nothing. JUST WALKING ON
THE BAD LEG.

There, has it sunk through that thick skull of yours yet, or are you
going to try to counter with another "But the spill..." bullshit
argument?
