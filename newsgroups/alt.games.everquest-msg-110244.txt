I do have the advantage that I work in the trade and can get stuff
cheaper.  Usually that doesn't make a lot of difference because the
margins are so low, but the latest PC graphics cards are a fair bit
cheaper... which means that the trade price I pay here in the UK
(before tax) is similar to the retail price you pay in the US.

I shall probably be visiting the US (NJ) in the next couple of months
- any idea of the price of a P4 in the region of 2GHz?  I have a
_very_ large suitcase.  :)
