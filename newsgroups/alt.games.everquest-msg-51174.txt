I am sure the original poster will kick himself at least 3 times over
this. Since a good kick in the pants will often serve as a wake-up
call, you could assume his deed has enriched his life at least 3 fold.

I asked myself "What would Jesus do?" and here is the answer I came up
with......

Being the son of God and knowing human nature I am sure he would tell
the beggar to go earn his gear like everyone else. If the beggar
continued he would then put him on ignore. Jesus has enough work to do
on any given day, so I doubt he would want any hassles while relaxing
and playing EQ.

Of course this is merely speculation. If Jesus did play EQ only a few
close members of his quild would know who he was. With all the clerics
casting res, and other players walking on water (lev) or summoning
food/drink, he would not stand out from the crowd.

Cheers
