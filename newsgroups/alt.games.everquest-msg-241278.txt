System overhead is a huge issue. One thing that hasn't been mentioned
are the practical problems in how you manage 72 connections. If its
through one machine, machine fall down go boom. If its through 72
machines thats a lot of overhead. You could have a 'mark', which is
simply a person you approach to lease time on their line, and in turn
basically pay for their Internet connection and computer time. That
wouldn't usually fly because normally people use their computers for
personal stuff and get itchy about other programs being run on their
system, even if they are getting paid for it. Even then, the amount
you would have to put out per machine would easily negate your money
generating power in game.

The second option is to setup 72 computer systems, but the power
overhead, hardware overhead, not to mention account overhead, would be
prohibitive. You're basically throwing money until such time that you
can get all these bots either levelled up or PA them. And PA'ing that
many is a very expensive proposition.. say 200-300 per. And then
hopefully you have a plan on the backside with which the selling of
what you get hopefully even remotely pays back cost. So far, running
that many connections usually negates by a wide margin the benefits
you could receive through the game, which is why it isn't done on that
level yet.

The third option is to start low, but in order to scale it you need to
break the executable to reduce overhead. You start with 6 connections
and 6 players and as you break apart the exe to remove the graphics
overhead it will let you do more with less. I personaly believe if
graphics free you could have a regular Pentium 2-3.. even 3-4 years
old being able to reliably run 6 or more connections over 2 or even 3
cable lines. Your monthy expense to run that group would be $12.99 X 6
+ $50 per month x 2. You also have setup expenses like modem cost,
installation, etc but per computer once setup $177.94 isn't that bad.
If you generate even 1-2 players a month that you PA or obtain great
items through that group that more than pays for the system. As you
make more money off it you reinvest in more equipment, and refine your
code. Always make sure that you use a couple of different sources for
your Internet, even dialup/phone line so if one goes down it won't LD
the group. Likewise, have uninteruptable power sources to be able to
ramp down and log off the members in the case of a blackout so they
all don't LD at once.

One last expense... if breaking apart the Everquest binary good luck.
Sure hope you took a lot of computer science and know what you are
doing, can learn fast, or can hire someone to do it. If not, don't
bother. Keeping it on a low scale, say 15-20 players run by 4-5 would
work pretty well for most mobs you would want to farm.
