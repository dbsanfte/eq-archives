Reposting this extremely useful guide to Cleric AA's from Monual as the
thread is a month or two old and adding some questions below it.....

Thanks Richard....

Very helpful advise that I've been following.  Will ding SCM3 tonight.....
Now I'm tossing up on getting MGB or Divine Arb. next.

Any suggestions out there?
Note, I'm not in a guild that raids much. Couple of times a month is all.

I've always wanted to get MGB since I was a newbie though to repay all those
kind folk that MGB near the bank etc.  Such a great gift!!

I love the idea of Celestial Regen but it's a lot of points to save for as I
need healing gift 3 as well, so I think I'll do that after I get both the
above.

Thanks & Regards,

Tuvarilo (65 cleric on Drinal)
