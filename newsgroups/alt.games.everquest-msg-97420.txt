No.  It was tedious, but it was a disadvantage of the caster classes.
Yes, they get a little more power (subjectively speaking) than pure
melees, but they have limitations.  IE, mana limits and they are more
susceptible to attack while regaining that mana.  And below 35, they
are effectively blind while medding.  It's a disadvantage.  Boring,
sure.  Tedious, maybe.  A big deal, hell no.

>Oh yes, you didn't find staring at the spellbook all that irritating.

No, I didn't.  It was a disadvantage.  I coped.  I learned to find
SAFE places to med up.  I chatted with friends and guildies.
Personally, I do think taking the book away takes a little away from
the game.  Nothing major to be certain, but a little of the flavor.

>Simple things indeed. So how is that screensaver doing these days?
>Still mezmerizing you as always? How DOES that ball keep bouncing?

My screen saver is pretty damned mesmerizing to me actually.  Then
again, my screen saver isn't a bouncing ball, but pictures of very
pretty and very scantily clad women.

Simple, yeah.  But sometimes you gotta go with that Y chromosome.
