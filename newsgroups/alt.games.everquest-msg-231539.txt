Whats the difference between a classed based system and a skill based 
system in which people gravitate to a few templates?

I mean, if I told you you could be a fighter, cleric, or wizard, or 
offered you a set of skills in which most people built either a melee 
oriented, healing oriented, or offensive caster oriented character, 
would the latter be any -more- limited than the class based one?

I prefer the idea of the latter even though it tends to evolve into 
similarly few "classes (templates)" because the discovery of those 
templates is based on player's experimenting with how the world really 
works, instead of designer's esthetic sense.

In EQ, for example, we see people currently preferring shadowknights and 
paladins to warriors as tanks, because they have an advantage in aggro 
aquisition and retention.  But that advantage comes from very low level 
spells; its just that to GET those low level spells, you have to pay 
your entire carreer by playing as a knight the whole way.

What if you could build a warrior with access to only level 9 knight 
spells?  Then the contrast would be between "pure warriors" (with no 
spells, like now), Warriors Errant (with only those low level spells 
needed to gain aggro better), and Pure Knights (with all the added buffs 
and heals in the case of paladins, with all the high level snare and 
fear and lifetap stuff in the case of SK).

The Warrior Errant would be the preferred Main Tank in well balanced 
groups, because he would have more HP/AC than pure knights, but be 
capable of actually keeping the mob hitting him better than the pure 
Warrior.

In a Class based system, there's no way to build a "Warrior Errant", 
other than the way its happening now, by the game designers changing the 
warrior class to give him more taunt capability.

Splendid
