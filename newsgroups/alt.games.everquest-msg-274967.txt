No. Only a dribbling slack jawed moron would think Palindrome means 
that, particularly after this lengthy a discourse on the subject. You 
take close minded to an art form.


The word 'fire' originally referred to that flaming stuff you often see 
on chopped wood when you go camping.

The word fire when refered to a gun comes from act of setting fire to 
the explosive. (from lighting a cannon fuse... to its modern equivalent 
of pulling the trigger to create a spark).

The word fire when referred to terminating someone from employment is a 
metaphor for the 'forcible ejection' that comes when firing a gun.

So when its time to fire someone do you think they are *really* advising 
you that they will imminently be setting you aflame?

Of course not they just plan on terminating your employment. Hot red 
flames are not even dancing in their subconsciousness.  Yet that doesn't 
change where the word came from.

And regardless of where it came from: if the verb fire happened to mean 
'violent rape' in the current vernacular it would be extremely rude for 
your boss to suggest he was going to 'fire' you, even if he means simply 
to terminate your employment. He should have the common sense to use 
words that aren't so ripe with vulgar double entendre.
