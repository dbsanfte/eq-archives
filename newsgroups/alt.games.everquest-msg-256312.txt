I dont do a lot of big time raiding but sometimes in ldon I will get a
combination of shaman and some other buffing classes and my buff slots will
get too close to 15.  I play an epiced bard so I need to keep one slot open
for my epic proc and one slot open for cleric's heal over times.  Sorry to
say I dont know what most of the buffs do that people keep casting on me so
I'm kind of guessing which ones to click off.  Any suggestions?
