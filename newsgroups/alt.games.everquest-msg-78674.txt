No. Fish scales are ONLY for Enduring Breath spells, so you dont drown, 
if you stay underwater for too long.
If you just keep an eye on your air meter, you will not drown (unless 
you do something stupid like i did, hunted fish for fish scales, got so 
tied up in killing i didnt see my air run out).

If youre in Freeport, there are a kinda sewer outlet at the monk guild, 
you run over a bridge to get over it to reach EFP. The water there are 
deep enough to swim in, but not high enough to drown in (dont know about 
trolls or gnomes, only tested on normal sized chars), and you can just 
run down into a corner, press the autorun button, and go take a walk, 
your swimming will go up.
