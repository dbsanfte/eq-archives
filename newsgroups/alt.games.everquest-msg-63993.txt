no for exploits that big you get banned after warnings to your account. 
People do it frequently in mistmoore.  They levitate and can camp the
maid butler without getting touched.  Since they haven't told us why, it
was merely speculation and to me seems like an exploit of what was
intended by verant.  As someone else pointed out here, it may have to do
more with the number of soul bound items they can have, and having added
some with SoL most likely, they could have decided to get rid of them. 
Maybe it was that they saw level 3-5's getting the keys and figured if
it's that easy, then why bother having the keys at all.  It's all
speculation.  Since you obviously don't understand that concept why
don't you just shut your trap.
