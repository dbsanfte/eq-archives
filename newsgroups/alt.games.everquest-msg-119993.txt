I think the main impact of this will simply be that pets will no
longer be shunned in groups. No more breaking mez, no more adds
because of a pet meandering too far, no more worry about out-damaging
the pet. Hell, if you do 1 point of damage to the mob and let the pet
take down the rest, the group will still get full xp.
