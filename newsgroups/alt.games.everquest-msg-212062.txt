Ok fair enough I've poped a 32,000dps a couple times with a head shot still
I'd never claim I did 150-32kdps ;-)

Such as? I guess one could make the case that the war marshals does a tad
more DPS but its too fast to be as good for tanking situations.

Actually save for some No drop end game weapons there aren't any 1h combo's
that will outdamage a windblade for a ranger course I was a tad higher level
when I got mine and parsed with it. But I still use if for melee situations
because I couldn't find a dual weild set up (for sale) that could keep up
with it. So I sold my Windworn and bought a COF and another windblade :)
The riposte situation is really where a windblade shines even over a
warmarshall's blade. The high delay means fewer but bigger hits. Save on
high AC mobs windblade will own any purchasable dual wield set up.
Now admitedly their are some situations where Dual Weild has advantages
(High AC Mobs or if you have a butt load of melee AA's) but PoP isn't
generally one of those places with mobs with low AC and high hps a windblade
is the ideal weapon for that situation. And I'd think if you were in a
raiding guild where you were hitting alot of the tough Luclin Names you'd
have access to some nice 1 handers to use in those situations that aren't
for sale.
The selling point for for 2 handers is their big sustained damage. Believe
me lots of rangers were pissed when the parses started coming out to show
what these new 2 handers could do. Once again we had to rethink our play
styles.

Well unless some new dropables have started coming down the pike since the
last I played the only real alternative to it I'm aware of is the
WarMarshall's blade. Widebladed greatsword really isn't any real alternative
the lack of hitpoints pretty much relagates it to budget gear.
Warmarshall's is nice for overall dps but its not very good for those
situations where you end up having to tank. The low delay means more
riposte's as well as a lower damage bonus so lower damage on riposte's you
land on the mobs.

Of course if one had the plats it would be nice to have one of each to
switch out as the situation warranted. However most people I know do not
have an unlimited amount of resources to drop on any particular character.

So for a ranger I find that a windblade is a wonderful weapon.
