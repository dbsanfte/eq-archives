IIRC, I read on some site (or SOMEwhere) that you can "fall from a great 
height" and survive.  I think that's supposed to mean "you can get dead 
if you try to fall too far."  

I'd venture to guess that as your skill goes up, your max "safe" height 
you can fall from goes up as well -  to a specific point.  Since I don't 
recall being where the OP said he died (my highest is a lvl 23 rogue, 
only been playing since July 2002 - part time), I have to assume it is "a 
VERY great height" to cause 20K damage.

BUT, I'm rambling now, so I'll say this on a side note:  I think it's fun 
to go to a newbie area that has a so-so height to jump from, and watch 
newbies (REAL ones) try to do the same thing! *SPLAT*  Okay, so maybe 
it's mean, but at least they learn-maybe.

Again, it's me.
