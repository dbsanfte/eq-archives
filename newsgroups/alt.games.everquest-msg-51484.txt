Gah!  No going AFK during CR!

This can turn a neat little 10 minute jam into a protracted hour, waiting
for people to come online so I can actually res em instead of blowing
mana on a res that won't be confirmed!

As enchanter, you are on the A list, res you first so the mana supply is
increased for ressing the rest.  You can't go AFK after res either, as
you are on duty slapping clarity on the B list; secondary healers and
mages and other mana supply/cut downtime guys, and also on watch
for needed mezing of roamers if that should happen.

Course I suppose if your cleric has a res stick you aren't quite so
vital to the operation...
