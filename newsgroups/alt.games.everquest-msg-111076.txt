Ungh, I may be a christian, but I must admit, we haven't made the best
musicians for the past few centuries.

Don't recall that, either.  I'd be interested to see it, though.

Anyways, it's not my intent to add to the argument, only to reflect on
what's said here.  Lokari, you've said that you judge each person on an
individual basis.  There are many christians who do so, as well.  Many have
separated themselves from the organized churches, because they don't think
any of them contain a shread of Christ's teachings.  I'm not sure that's
entirely the case, but I do believe a vast majority of christianity needs to
go back to the source material, and stop accepting what others tell them.
