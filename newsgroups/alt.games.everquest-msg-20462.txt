Are you a wood elf? Loss of hair seems to be a recurring wood elf
problem, especially in Velious. (I wear a crown of leaves and my hair
occasionally vanishes)

As for the armor patches - I am somewhat behind on them, wanting to
play rather than download. Last night I downloaded the patch for type
19, tried to play, got booted repeatedly to desktop after server
selection. I turned off Velious armor and logged in just fine. Now, I
just checked my EQ folder and it appears the patch server in its
brilliance DID start replacing the patch for type 20 despite my
canceling the patch and I have a strong suspicion I'll be able to play
if I turn on all graphics except 20 :) (Or, if I finish the patch, of
course)
It jusst surprises me that the patch program didn't realize it had
been canceled before messing up my files. It hasn't done that before.
