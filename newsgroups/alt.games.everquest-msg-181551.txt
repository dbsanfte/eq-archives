    And some of the troll/ogre newbie quests lower faction with the other
even further. There used to be a quest in game describing how the ogres were
secretly shipping weapons to the frogloks, and how the trolls were secretly
aiding one of the enemies of the ogres (lizard men?), but I'm not sure if
it's still in game. It involved Forager Grikk, Zimbittle, and Dorn.
