To get to the bazaar you must have the Shadows of Luclin expansion.  To get
to the bazaar you go to one of the spires (four tall curving pillars) and
wait for the spires to gate you to Luclin.  If you have Planes of Power, you
can also get there by clicking on a "book".  These books are located in each
newbie zone and they will gate you to the Plane of Knowledge.  From POK you
then take the portal into the Nexus, and from there into the Bazaar.

Sounds a lot more complicated than it really is.  Take a look at
www.eqatlas.com for maps and information on locations of the Spires, Books
and to figure out your way around the Nexus and Bazaar.
