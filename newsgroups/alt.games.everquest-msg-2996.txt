Heck, I just about *lived* that story.  If you change the time frame to three
months ago, and switch "no wizards or druids at 29" to "no wizards or druids who
sounded like they would port me."  And then change it to "wanted to go from
Qeynos to Steamfont Mts.".  I didn't delete the character, but I did leave the
corpse to rot and just started accumulating new crap for him.
