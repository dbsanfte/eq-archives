I think they have stated that there will be *no* OOC channel.

In fact, there will probably be no common language either -- a dwarf
must learn ogre to communicate with ogre players.  What is now
'common' will be converted to a 'human' language.  This is quite a
good rule for RP, IMHO.

There is some debate about how to discourage various communication
workabouts.  For instance, it appears there will also be no player
/emotes, since that could be used to bypass the language barrier (only
the hardcoded /laughs, /jumps etc would remain).  There is even
concern about the little character description text box that pops up
when someone looks at you -- could that be used to bypass languages? 
The developers think so.  Thus, that too will be eliminated, or
perhaps restricted so that you could only revise the description once
per level, or while in your hometown, etc.

PS:  it is inevitable in this thread that some sincere person is going
to ask for player-vs-player as a way to enhance roleplay.  In
*theory*, that person is completely, absolutely, 100% right.  But in
*practice*, PVP attracts jerks in enough number to ruin roleplay for
everyone else.  For gawd's sake, leave the idea alone.
