Nobody ever refers to their car as a horseless carriage either. The 
contracted form has become a word of its own.

'toon' has been around in video games since people modded doom graphics. 
(This predated thte use of 3d so they weren't called models) ... they 
were sprites, and pretty much immediately therafter toons. That they 
were never called 'cartoons' in full is simply because the abbreviation 
for cartoon: toon already existed at the time ... IMO.

I doubt anyone says wizzy to be hip. :)
