Ah, and to further support Bizbee's argument. If you have a true hacker hack
your account, they would not be stealing your characters items. Instead they
would steal your credit card information and leave without you knowing that
it happen. They would then use that information to make purchases in your
name. You would not find out about this information for approximately 2-4
weeks in which time they would make more money with the credit cards then
they ever would have selling some virtual item on E-Bay. All these purchases
would be made online with the shipping to a PO Box that would be cancelled at
then end of the theft period and long before you realized that you were
robed.
