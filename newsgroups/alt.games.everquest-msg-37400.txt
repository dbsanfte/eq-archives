Let me guess you are a Mage or a Necro? Just try putting yourself in their
shoes Chanters get hounded to death for Clarity, Druids and Wizards are
hounded for ports, and Clerics for Rezzing. The real problem is people have
gotten to the point where they believe it is your responsibility to take
care of their needs, no please no offer of compensation just drop what ever
you are doing run over to them and provide your services. Wither you believe
it or not I have been flamed for being the only healer in a group in Lower
Guk and wont leave to perform a Res for some bozo.

Think about it
