As well, within the last 3 months I used wolf form to make my ogre
shaman indifferent in Jagged Pine forest to the npc's so he could hand
in some faction quest items. I can't remember the last time I used wolf
form to powerlevel someone in Unrest so I can't say whether it's
changed, but I have seen the effect the original poster described with a
dwarf paladin being the only one in a group who remained kos in wolf
form back in late 99. I've never heard of class based faction, only
racial and religious, but maybe the undead in unrest just hate paladins
and see through the illusion, like npc's used to (do they still, havent
checked?) sense your religion through illusions.
