That won't work either.  Make a cleric and you'll find that everyone 
else made clerics too, by the time you get up to 65 with a buttload of 
AA and your vital 65 spells you'll find the same thing has happened 
there.  Make a shaman?  Same thing.  Bard?  Same thing.

Whatever class is desirable today, people playing less desirable classes 
will make as alts, same as you are contemplating.

And the game will change, so that the currently undesirable classes will 
become the desireable ones.

IF you dual box and PL the living Brell out of a currently desirable 
class, you might be able to meet minimum requirements to get into a 
power guild with him before those minimum requirements change.

Or you could spend a tenth that time and effort taking your current 
character up high enough to meet the admittedly higher standards to get 
-that- character into the guild you had in mind.

Or you could join a less uber guild and help raise that guild up to 
where its at the level you want to be at while you level yourself up to 
where you'd need to be to be useful in such a guild anyway; nice thing 
about this plan is that you'll have built up a lot of seniority in that 
guild by the time it gets there, while if you join an elemental level 
guild now, you'll be low man on the totem pole for every drop.

Personally, I couldn't care less about the extreme high end game, and 
have more fun getting characters up into the 50s then I ever did getting 
my cleric up to 65, I don't even think about playing him anymore 
really.  Fun while it lasted, but eventually all the fun got sucked out 
of him and I was happier playing alts and experiencing the 1 to 50 game 
again with new things to learn.  But if you -wnat- the high end game, 
then you have to earn the high end game, there isn't an easy way in by 
simply switching to some other class.
