The quality of the class specific nodrop items hat have been dropping
in EK and WC can be better then what my level 53 druid has on at
times. While we high levelers were doing the undead event related
quest in EK, I got a belt ac6 5wis and some other small buff, and an
earring 4wis some other small buff. Not bad from a level 30 wandering
MoB. Better than what drops in a lot of the dangerous dungeons of this
game. Take advantage before it goes away. Events in WC 2 hours after
the last and the EK one lasts until quest in completed and then comes
back two hours later usually beginning at game time sunset. Qeynos
hills is the usual undead invasion, nothing dropping there but rusty
weapons and shields at times, same coding they used two years ago I'm
sure. Wc and Qeynos hills clear up at sunrise, EK goes on till quest
is finished, Rathe is constantly on, but be warned the dragon is
trained all over the place. I wanted to take a look in Rathe and
wasn't there for 3 minutes before I was hit with a 500AE cold followed
by a charm, it broke in time for me to run away while the dragon was
eating two other fellows for lunch, I love escape ports. :-)
