Did you try this whilst grouped? If not you may have missed it because
it only has two small icons in it unless you are grouped.  It has no
border if it is in the black portion of the screen.  If that isn't it
then you could have accidentally moved it off the screen.  There is an
option to allow windows off screen - if you uncheck that then it should
come back.  If it still doesn't come back then maybe you turned it off
whilst trying to turn it back on - press alt-g again.

You don't memorize spells - you just put them in the hotbutton bar. I
suppose that could be called memorizing but not really because you can
cast spells by pressing the icon in the book.
