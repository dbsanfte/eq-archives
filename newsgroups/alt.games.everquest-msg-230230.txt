I think the people who are really good at it can make it "easy" all the 
way to the end of the line. Tarre's cleric was a good example. She'd 
done it for so long that, by the time we finished with those characters, 
she was usually doing cross stitch, needlepoint stuff while being the 
primary healer in raids and groups and never missed a trick. I think the 
only time she had to put it down was when part of a large CHeal rotation 
on a boss mob.

However, with that said, I'm finding that it really takes time to get to 
that point. Clerics have a lot of good spell lines, and what you keep 
memmed, and what roles you fill (aside from healing) can really vary a 
lot depending on the size and makeup of the group, the type of mobs you 
are going after (normal vs. undead, etc.) and other factors as well. 
There are also a lot of tough decisions that have to be made on the fly 
when the situations get hairy. All in all, I would say that both the 
spell selection and decision making are magnitudes harder than it was 
with my wizard, who is, after all, fairly one dimensional in group and 
raid situations for the most part.
