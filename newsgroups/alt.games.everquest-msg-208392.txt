I'd like to get like about 60 naked gnomes on
luclin to run to crushbone and just start dying.

I think the logs would be hilarious....either that or
maybe somekind of run through some zones enmass.

A good time on my part would be 10pm EST, maybe start near
the PoK book in Kelthin then run to crush...Friday 18 JUL

Mccarron

Something besides kill'in Friday night....
