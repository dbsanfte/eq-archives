Thanks for all your replies=).. I think I will just cancel my account and
try to get it back when I come back.  I trust my friend with my char 100%, I
wouldn't mind if he lvl'ed her, sold everything, uber'ed her out=) or
anything.. I was more worried about my credit card number.. but everyone
says that my char should be there when I get back, so I think I will just
give that a try=)
