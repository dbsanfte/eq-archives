I played my first char (a cleric) to 47, fiddled a little bit with others,
actually quit EQ for a bit, then settled on the beastlord which has turned
out to be the comfort zone. I'll just never be in a RL situation of being
able to really grind, so its the slow and steady path for me.

Beastlord turned out to be a much better fit for that playing pattern than
the cleric, although LDoN has tempted me to resurrect Chinetter (LDoN is the
perfect form of EQ playtime for me, and clerics are in such high demand for
that purpose).

Anyway if I do hit 65 and/or finish the BST epic by the time EQ2 rolls out,
then I imagine making a decision whether to switch games or to start fresh
in EQ with a different class. But I would kind of like to take a screenshot
of myself as a Feral Lord -- if nothing else that accomplishment would earn
me some serious Dad faction with my 11-year-old who just dinged 30 with his
druid.
