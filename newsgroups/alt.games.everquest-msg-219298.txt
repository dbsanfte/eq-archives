Granted, ... but the fact that it's more efficient to tank while
soloing isn't relevent to whether it's more efficient for a shaman to
tank over a melee. 

 Stoicism might change things at lower levels, I grew up without it,
but even torpor doesn't tip the balance in favor of a shaman tanking
since you have Kragg's Mending before Torpor. It's always more
effiecent to use Kragg's (Quiessence later on) on a real tank if you
have that option.
