Hmm. Maybe it's just Veeshan, but the OT and, now, FV docks are
patrolled by BOTH the undead and Dragoons.  Befor, many of the elven
NPC's in FV could see right through my invis, making running that
gauntlet difficult (the tunnel guards did not, but the pallys at the
other end of the tunnel could)

If I time it right, I can get to the OT translocator by invising to
undead, and running by the undead marines while the Dragoons are
wandering elsewhere in the outpost, but that's proven fatal more than
once :) Stupid Dragoons hiding behind walls...

Xiphos - I've only managed to get into an LDoN group once.  It's dead
as dead can be for anyone under 70 on Veeshan.  I'm hoping that will
change when we merge with Luclin, which actually appears to have less
of a twink population, suprisingly.
