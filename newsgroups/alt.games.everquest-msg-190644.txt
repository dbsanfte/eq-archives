To a certain extent, players do care. It's SOE who don't care enough to
waste their time trying to keep them happy.

Now, if thousands of players cancelled their accounts in protest at the
likes of these pp/account forsale sites, then they might act. Something else
I don't see happening at any time soon.

They made a move on Ebay, just simply asking them not to host the auctions,
Ebay has a policy against doing anything illegal (I'm not saying this is),
so SOE emailed Ebay and asked them to stop, which as you know they did. The
other sites are differant and a simple email to this effect won't achieve a
thing. More effort from SOE is needed, something that you just won't see.

I'm not saying I don't care, but I'm a realist.
