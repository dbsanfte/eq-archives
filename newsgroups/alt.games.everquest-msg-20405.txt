No.  Most weapon/melee skills, including 1HB, require that you be able
to get exp from a mob in order to have a chance to increase your
weapon/melee skill.  Generally this means blue-or-higher.

However, it just so happened that the green spider you
were fighting was "high green" to you, i.e. close enough to being blue
that you still got some exp (the general rule is that a green mob
one level away from being blue to you will give you 50% of the exp
it used to give you back when it was blue, and one two levels away
from being blue will give you 25% -- anything lower is worth 0%).

For the most part though, most greens are low enough that you
will have no chance of getting weapon/melee skill increases from
them.  Thus the advice to fight blue-or-higher mobs if you want
to train up your weapon/melee skills.
