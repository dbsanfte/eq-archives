Generally, it applies to skills you don't have available at level 1.
If you could have gotten it at level 1 (like 1hs, bind wound, sense
heading, languages and tradeskills(tinkering, poison and alchemy
notwithstanding), your first trained point gives you a skill of 1 and
you are told you have improved your knowledge of whatnot. If it isn't
available until a later stage (like meditate, non ranger tracking,
spell research, dual wield) your first point gives you a skill
equivalent of your level (level 13 = skill 13) and you are told you
have learned the basics of whatnot.
