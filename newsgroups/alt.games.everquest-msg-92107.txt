Do you have OE set up to automatically download all bodies in the group?  
Or do you download them one at a time as you click on it?  Batch download 
is a GOOD thing, and it's the one reason I preferred OE for newsgroups on 
my Solaris box a couple years ago.

Don't you just LOVE those huge .sig files idiots use on web forums?  
Wouldn't it be NEAT if every fscking usenet post included a 40k jpg that 
you had to download every fscking time.  Oh, and have 50% of them be 
broken, so you can't display anything until it times out?  Oh joy!
