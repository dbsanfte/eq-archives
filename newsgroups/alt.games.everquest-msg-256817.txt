I can't write the pronunciation in english

Kay Nos, with the nos as in spanish Nosotros

There's no U so I figure it isn't Kway Nos  (or Quay nos)

I find I tend to pronounce any word I don't know as if it was spanish, 
since the rules in spanish are much clearer and simpler than the rules 
in english, which tends to violate any rule I know with appalling 
regularity anyway; I never realized what a crappy language it is until I 
  started home schooling my kids.
