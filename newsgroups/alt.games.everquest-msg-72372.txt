What level is your guild Davion?  I'm not trying to be snotty here,
but I see a ton of rangers in the low and mid-levels, but almost none
55+.  I don't buy that 'Rangers are useless' argument, but I do think
that a number of combat and role-play issues make a ranger a very good
class for a casual gamer, but lead to diminishing returns when
approaching the end-game.  Not that rangers aren't useful in big
raids, but that the pain to get through the 50s for a rather limited
end-game specialty role is rather out of whack.  Being able to solo
well from 20-50, combined with the (incorrect) believe that rangers
are manasinks in exp groups, tends to push a lot of rangers towards
soloing, until 50 when it just becomes too damn tough.
To expand on this, I'm thinking what other classes are desirable and
rare in raid guilds, and at least in my experience, I think of wizards
and bards.
Wizards seem to be a royal bitch to level, at least without enough
twinking to get them t-boots and some AC/HP gear early on and INT gear
above 20, but they have a very well defined end-game role.  They are
also really useful in certain exp groups post-50, with evacs and nukes
to deal with stubborn mobs, and decent overall damage output with a
mana-regenner in the group.  Wizards are almost an absolute
requirement for boss mobs, with their bane spells, but even on regular
blue mobs, nukes stack and dead faster is better.  Compare that to a
ranger, which has a very nice discipline, with a refresh time that
ensures it's only used on the boss mob.  Oh, yeah, and rangers get a
lot of nice outdoor-only stuff, which doesn't do much good in end-game
encounters.  The thing is that wizards are so desirable that guilds
will actively recruit and PL wizards.  Finally, most wizards I've met
have grouped extensively their entire career, though that may be just
an oddity of my guild.  (It grew out of a previous guild, with a core
group of 30 or so who have been guilded together for 18 months or
more.)
On the other hand, you have bards, who are really, really nice for
raids, and decent for exp groups.  Two or three bards can absolutely
make all the difference in raids with AE casters, at least for
pre-uber guilds.  Nothing like an extra 90FR/CR and 180MR to keep
folks alive and fighting.  My guild is lucky in that with only 3
bards, we can usually count on at least 2 to be present for any given
raid, yet the clerics still fight over us.  We've tried recruiting and
PLing bards at 50 or so, just because there are so few decent bards,
but we've found that there really is no way to make a lazy player into
a good bard.  
The only other classes that I see that are really rare at the high end
are shamen, and I think it's just that they are SOOOO required for
almost any 50+ encounter that every guild has a couple.
Anyway, that's just my take on it, trying to put off wrapping the
final christmas presents.  I'm sure that anyone playing a pally, sk,
or <other semi-rare class here> will think I'm full of edible goo.
