Ah! I am envious :) I'm still grinding through 57! I picked the same time to
start with AA's, although the temptation to wait till 62 (post 60 levels are
much faster than pre-60 levels) and blow all of 2 points to get Harvest of
Druzzil (no pre-requisites other than level 62, and every 7 minutes get a 0
cast-time, no stun Harvest that doesn't take up a spell slot... Nice)

Why fury ahead of mastery first? I plan to get SCM3 first, as the actual
effect is to decrease the casting cost of every spell you cast. An extra 10%
off every spell that stacks with your existing specializations and any mana
preservation focus items sounded more useful to me than more frequent crits.

I've been thinking of getting SCM2 and Fury2 (for the same 12 points), and
then get my familiar, Nexus Gate, etc. Manaburn is less than useful right
now, and I hope it's changed again, but I find the odds of that
rather... small. Btw, 12 points in MC is 3 mana/turn regen. 15 points in
Improved/Allegiant familiar is 6, plus a bunch of extra stuff like resists
and +'es to mana...

This is not actually what it does. It summons a familiar with no mana cost
(or check against a wizards crappy conjuration skill) that is superior to
the Greater Familiar spell.

Actually, this is the one I most want :) Then the POP Allegiant Familiar.

Either Exodus or Nexus Gate is a nice 'Get Out of Jail Free' card :)

If you spend most of your time casting 3 second Draughts, then Quick Direct
Damage is not going to help. But with things like Ice Spear, Agnarrs
Thunder, etc (the bug guns) it might be nice... Low priority in my opinion.

Quick evac looks exceptionally lame to me, but I've been solo quadding too
much lately, so my opinions are biased :)

For me, SCFM1, Familiar, (Nexus Gate or Exodus, undecided), finish SCFM,
then probably go back and finish out the Archetype, or grind to 62 for the
INCREDIBLY COOL Harvest of Druzzil.

A couple :)
