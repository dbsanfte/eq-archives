Troll and iksar I knew about...I had no idea about the barbarians and
ogres. Is there any explanation why Halflings are given the leg-up?  Like
I said before, they have a nice starting city, nice stats, nice racial
abilities, and not any dumpier than dwarf or gnome.  Doesn't seem like
they have any inherent penalties.

I must also say that if you compare halfling stats to the stats of the
other races that can play rangers....if halflings become rangers, they
will be a NICE race to choose.  Best wis (along with woodelves), second
best strength, best dex, agi, and sta.  And the usual hide and forage.
