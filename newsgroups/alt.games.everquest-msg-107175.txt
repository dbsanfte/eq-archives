I found map of Velks at http://www.everlore.com/ShowScreenShot.asp?id=455601 it has
numerous letters that appear to designate various points of interest; however, there is no
explanation as to what the letters designate. The link provided here is a proxy for the
deadzed.com site, but there is nothing there, that I could find, providing further
explanation.

Anyone know what the letters stand for?

Is there a better map somewhere?
