    No, the Warders aren't meant to be messed with. Warders are a Verant way
of saying "You haven't cleared all the bosses, go back and finish the job".

    The hard mobs in VT are the yard trash. "Yard trash" being an odd term
for stuff that can, depending on what you pull, quad for 500, AoE nuke for
1500, AoE blind/knockback, respawn in a slightly lesser form of itself after
it dies, AND/or flurry and proc a slowdown. These mobs come in groups, not
singly, and have hellishly high HPs and fast respawn. Grinding through the
halls is the most challenging part of VT. We've beat every boss mob we've
done, and we killed Aten last night, on at worst the second try. The bosses
aren't the challenge.

    Read my other posts. Warping him to the lower room being an exploit?
Maybe, maybe not - I won't try and read the cryptic mind of Verant on this
one. Deliberately pushing a monk through the roof of the room you're in to
set up the warp? That sounds like an exploit to me.
