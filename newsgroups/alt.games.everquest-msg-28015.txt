Hi all...I've got a 43 monk...after that last patch I noticed I am failing
Feign Death around 10% of the time.  Before the patch I maybe failed Feign
Death once every 100 times...(probably not that much either)  I've been told
by at least 5 other monks that they are experiencing the same thing.  All
these monks are anywhere from 30-45.  I talked to a few friends post 50 and
they haven't had a problem..  Anyone else notice this?

Thanks for your input,
43 Monk
