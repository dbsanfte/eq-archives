Welcome to the wonderful world of Corpse Retrieval. Hotkey a /loc button,
like this:

where
/loc
/doability (whatever number sense heading is)

or make your attack key:
Die!
/say %T must die!
/loc
/attack
/doability (whatever number sense heading is)

This way you will have the location of your body wherever you fought
something. Hit the where button as you run away, so in case you die on the
run to guards, you can still find yerself.

This should help in future- the others gave good advice on how to find the
missing corpse now. Your corpse will exist for a week.
