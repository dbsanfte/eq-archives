This is in reference to various posts I've read on message boards, for
example, about clerics camping Ragefire for their epic, about how they
had been camping for days for Ragefire to show up.  Is that LITERALLY
days, where people take time off work and sit by their computer
waiting for Ragefire? (as opposed to logging for the night where it's
2 a.m. July 1, 3245 in Norrath and it's still 2 a.m. July 1, 3245 in
Norrath when you log back in again).   Is that what is necessary in
the high end game for people to get their epic, to have to keep your
computer on for several days logged in to EQ waiting for whatever mob
to spawn?  

Thanks in advance,
