I had this problem when I got a new computer, and re-installed EQ on
the new machine. I had misplaced my kunark CD, so I skipped it,
thinking that the needed files would be provided when I installed
Luclin. Well, I was wrong. What happened was I had the zone map files,
but not the models for any NPC's in kunark. The rest of the world was
ok, just in Kunark I got the default human model for everything.

If nothing else works for you, a complete re-install from CD should
fix you up.
