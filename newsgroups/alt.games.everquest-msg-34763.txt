Heheh I feel for you man, I really do.

I'm a level 12 Halfling Rogue with a Bloodstained Fang that a friend gave to
me and full banded armour. I was running through Misty Thicket yesterday and
I saw a level 4 Halfling Rogue in nearly full Mrylokar armour, a Sash of the
Dragonborn (if i remember rightly), Fungi Tunic, a Bloodpoint and a ton of
other guff that surely racked his stats up. When I asked him what he was
planning on using at 13 when he gets dual wield he said "My other
bloodpoint, naturally"

My jaw hit the floor, there's me using a stinking Snow Leopard fang and
there's this guy who is 3 times lower than me doing more damage than me....
