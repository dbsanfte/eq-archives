On 23 Oct 2002 13:54:14 -0700, Stormguide@hotmail.com (Horus) (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>I know many arent keen on PLing (and i hope this doesnt turn into an
>anti-PL thread), but for those that do, where are your best spots?

Having a 60 druid had its advantages. I had a L8 necro I took to
unrest to PL. She dinged 9 after only 3 fights (8 kills). In 90
minutes she went from 8-16. I left after that; people are happy when
you clean yard trash but not if you're doing the house.

My only advice for pling is: do it where people aren't hunting for
exp. A pled twink can kill a lot faster than unpowered groups. It's
just rude to do it in ocmpetition for the same mobs.
