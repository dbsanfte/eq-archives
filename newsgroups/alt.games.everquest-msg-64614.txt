I played DAOC for awhile, and had enough.  basically it was the same ol'
same ol'.  The names were a little stupid in DAOC.   the graphics were good,
although the single layer of movability wasn't that great.  even the water
wasn't really there, just slows you down.  If you fight in water, on your
swings you stand up, no matter if your in the middle of the lake or
where-ever in water.

Seems alot of people don't even understand how they have the exp working in
DAOC.  you can perma-farm, but you get a bonus for new kills / not farming
that slowlt goes away.  if you move to a new spot and kill their for awhile,
you can leave, kill somewhere else, then come back.  Two farm spots (with
different critters) that are close is the best way to go with their current
system if your concerned about going up in levels faster in DAOC.

DAOC seems more along the lines of PvP as its end result, while EQ seems
more along the lines of PvM in most situations.  there are PvP servers that
DAOC emulates pretty closely.

The Siege warfare will be kind of kewl in DAOC.  Stronghold also does alot
of siege warfare, and you can control it alot better.

I decided I didn't wanna pay another $10 or more a month for DAOC, and took
a break from EQ for awhile.  got a ton of games haven't been able to play
enough, including Civ 3, Art of Magic, Pool of Radiance, and Stronghold.
Recently also got SoL.

There are a ton of new games coming out I'm looking forward to.  Check out
my web page if your interested in finding out what I'm looking forward to
coming out.
http://pages.prodigy.net/wwwkevinww/  many of these are MMorpgs, including
City of Heroes and Horizons.  Being a SuperHero in a MMorpg, or a Dragon
would just rock and be a new type of exp.  Another game sort of looking
forward to and will probably test out is Shadowbane, which will allow you to
create cities in a MMorpg.  just sounds really neat.

As for about Verant screwing things up, I personally think that EQ's way of
handling items is much more interesting than DAOC.

I also like that EQ is a little slower paced, which allows time for heals
without it being a clickfest, and for a little bit more time to think about
how things would best be handled.  You also have time to frantically type a
few things during the fight, while in DAOC you really don't have time.

I think them listening to their customers about SOL trivial loot code shows
that Verant doesn't suck as much as your saying it does.  I'm not saying
they don't completely suck, just not as much as you say they are.

Customer Service seemed better to me in EQ than DAOC also.

my thoughts in the subject,

Kevin
