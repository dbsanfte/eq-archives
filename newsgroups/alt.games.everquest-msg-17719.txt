I usually go to freeport and offer binds at the west gate, can make
some pp that way, one guy payed me 5pp for it, money that i can
spend on spells, my necro is also dubious to the guards and that is
good, i have so far had an easyer time playng the dark elf compared to
my human necro in qeynos, he will get killed in his own hometown, and
Lars McMannus and Holly Windstalker in the hills will kill him to, but
i managed to help drag a corpse out of the catacombs and made 10pp
for that, good money for a lvl 3.
