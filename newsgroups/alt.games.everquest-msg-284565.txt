The reverse DS, ime, is almost never worth the mana.  The mobs don;t
usually hit often enough to make even a marginal difference.  And the
hammer pet seems to do marginal DPS as well.  A nice add if you're
solo'ing but in a group I find it almost worthless.

the spell haste buff does not stack with worn if I recall correctly.
But it will override anything not at least Spell Haste IV, possibly V.
Never done a comparison.  I admit I'm not much of a parser or
comparison junky.  I just play.

Regarding the kill rate you mentioned, it's a noticeable difference if
you're 2-boxing since those simple hot keyed nuke buttons can anywhere
from 4 to 8k of damage over a single fight.
