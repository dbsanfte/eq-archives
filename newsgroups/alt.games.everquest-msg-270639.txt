AO has a breathtaking range of social clothing, and there are even a
large uber of high-end quests for clothes.

MY persinal favourite, back in my AO days, was the wedding dress on my
Opifex Fixer.  She looked fantastic, with her lovely white dress and
twin SMGs...

Also look out for the Doctor (or Nurse) items of clothing, which give
boost to First Aid and Treatment (boosting treatment helps you equip
higher Quality implants).

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
