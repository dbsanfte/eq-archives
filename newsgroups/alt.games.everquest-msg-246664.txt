They didn't. They had us run an activex application that took less that 
2 minutes to do whatever it does and not run it again. That's more like 
leaving your car unlocked when you go into the local kwik-e-mart to get 
a squishee in broad daylight and then locking it for the rest of your 
life whenever you want to isn't it? They don't tell you to open your 
system up forever, just ONE thing for 2 minutes...

Maybe I'm too behind the times, but how many times has Sony's site been 
hacked? Are they really that unsecure (sic?) that we need to worry with 
them being hacked constantly?
