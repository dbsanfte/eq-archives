No idea, but I heard its a good idea to make sure your tailoring skill is in
the mid-20's before trying it. 

On the other hand, my BL combined his on the first try with a skill of around
18.

For the next part after the fasteners, I suggest you raise your skill as high
as possible and save yourself some grief. I failed six or seven times, with a
skill of about 23, before I gave up and got a port to Gfay.
