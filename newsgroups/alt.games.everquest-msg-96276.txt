 I got the point of discussion. You don't like the bobbing thing.
Someone casts a spell on you that makes you bob, click it off. Done! I
was mainly responding to biz not you but the point it the same. Why do
they do it? Just because they can I suppose. If I had a beneficial spell
I'd probably cast it on people around me. 

 Just for the record, I prefer SoW over SoE. I hate it when someone
gives me SoE in CS and I'm on my way to ToV. I zone into SG and guess
what, no more zoom. I hate the bobbing as well. Gets annoying after
about 5 minutes.
