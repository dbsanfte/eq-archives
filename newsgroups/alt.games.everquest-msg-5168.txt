So, what do you call the lvl 55 teddybear?

For that matter, I guess we should bring up the flaming sword of
Xuzl...

Where would you draw the line between pet class and non pet class if
not at the point of being able to summon one? Are Mages and Necros the
only pet classes, or do you also concede to the enchanter and SK pets,
and then there's the shaman pet, and then druids get a pet 20 levels
later, and then wizards at 59. So, how much does the pet have to suck
for it to not be a pet class anymore?
