Also, having just picked up the Orb of Frozen Water... why don't these
intermediate items have any stats?  The epic is literally just some clog in
the bank account till its finished... and what are the odds I'm going to actually

thrice damned list?  Hmm, given that I've been playing for a year and a half now,
I suppose those odds don't utterly suck.
