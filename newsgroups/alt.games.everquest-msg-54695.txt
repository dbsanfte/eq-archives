Hahahaha!
The people who fought Klandicar pre-buff and post-buff would know
first hand what just a single AoE does.  :)

Pre-buff:  AoE fear and high melee damage (quad 700+).
Post-buff:  AoE fear + AoE 400 cold nuke/dispell (the latter is lure
checked so forget about resisting it) and same melee damage.

Immediately after the buffing, many were comparing Klandicar's
difficulty with Sontalak.

*SOME* dragon AoEs are just sick in terms of making those mobs
difficult.  For example, Hoshkar isn't a royal pain because of his
melee, it's because of his 1250hps DD + 70% slowdown AoE.
