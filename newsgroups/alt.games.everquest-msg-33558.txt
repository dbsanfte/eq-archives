People tend to do it multiple times in a row to get the LoW
since it's the rare.
It could be someone else tried it before you and died, It
happened once or twice, when a group of 6 or so of us did
it, but not sure why.  If you keep having problems all I can
suggest is /bug it and petition it.

Cthulhu Loves Me
Author unknown:

Cthulhu loves me, this I know
For the High Priests tell me so
He won't eat me, no not yet
He's our Lord, all dank and wet
