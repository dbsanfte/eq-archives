Yeah, in far southwest shadow haven there is a mini wizard spires
thingie (what you port in on from nexus) Go north of that a step or so
and there is a door which you go through that has no npcs inside and a
broken door laying against the opposite wall. Proceed to your left and
go through the illusionary wall, then turn right in there and zone.

Once zoned into Echo caverns, go to your right ( I think) and there is
like a big rock wall. Click on it some and it will slide open. This is
a hidden area where sks and evils are liked (for the most part.. for
some reason some of the vendors in there are still dubious, but
trainers like you and your spell seller likes you)
