Well, I am running:

AMD Athlon 550 on a MSI MS6167 MB
64 Megs RAM
Cablemodem (was running on 56K that never connected higher than 40k)
Creative Labs Permedia 2 Video Card.

The only problem I had with the modem was it was more likely to drop
connection with high lag.    The rest I havent had a problem with.
Your system is perfectly fine to play the game AFAIK but I dont know a
ton about what the video card is like in reality.
