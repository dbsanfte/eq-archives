Blacksnow Interactive, one of the early item selling companies, did sue both
Mythic and Funcom after having accounts banned.  I don't know what happened
with the Funcom suit, but Mythic won, and Blacksnow disappeared.

I think the problem is that the companies just haven't built in good enough
tracking to figure out who is doing the selling.  Actually, if they had good
enough tracking, they would not need to ban people for buying or
selling...just trash the items.  So, you go buy 100k plat on IGE, and go
wild in the Bazaar...and then a week later, all the 'leet stuff you bought
has its recommended level bumped to 500, and is NO DROP, and works out to be
about equivalent to newbie gear.
