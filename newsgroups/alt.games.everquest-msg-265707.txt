Hmmm, try this again since my first reply seems to have vanished
without a trace...

Dennis is correct, and you ought to take your own advice.  The
author made it quite plain at the start of his essay that he was
editorializing and promoting an agenda (you do understand the
soapbox reference, correct?).  Pretending that his examples were
intended to be anything other than "prescriptive" in that context
is willful ignorance at best.

He gives precious little evidence in support of his thesis, and
even less in support of his claim that his examples are relevant.
All in all, it's a mildly deceptive (or creative, if you prefer)
but effective presentation of his ideas coupled with piss-poor
arguments in favor of them.  Taken as a whole it fits Dennis'
characterization to a "T".
