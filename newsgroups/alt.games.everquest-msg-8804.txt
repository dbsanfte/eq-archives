1st level, you can run erudin to qeynos on the boat and
pick up enough money on the mail run to buy enough
muffins to hit second level, third if you are lucky with
the cash payout.  One trip.  And who in his right mind
would have his newbie erudite do his first few levels
in the tox?  Night blind race, hmm, lets put one of
the darkest newbie areas in the game in as their home!
The Surefall to Qeynos run is almost as safe, the road
is generally clear if you keep your eyes open at all,
a young ranger or druid can pick up good pocket money
and exp running this a few times.

I do wish the reward was commensurate with the degree
of difficulty; why the felwithe to kelethin run pays the same as
the Feerot to Freeport one is beyond me!

Also, doing the first half of the tacklebox quest is a no brainer,
and builds up faction quickly with the good guys in qeynos
along with getting you some silvers.  Hmm, then there's the
bard report quests, again, not even a whiff of fighting needed,
good faction and some change.  Qeynos is a hotbed
of this sort of quest, a real non begging non-twink is in
hog heaven there.  I leveled up a SK to 3rd accidentally,
doing the whole tacklebox quest repeatedly just to see
what the range of drops were (best drop is a +10poison,
+10 disease ring which oddly an SK cannot wear!)
