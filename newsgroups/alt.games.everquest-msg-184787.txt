I told you it was 'my opinion' (that's what IMO means).  It technically is
not against the rules or else it would be more than an opinion.  To be clear
on this, power leveling as I am commenting on it is getting experience you
did not earn yourself.  It is using tricks of the game such as having
someone take a mob down to a sliver of health and then atone it so that you
can get the kill and all the experience.  You are not supposed to get
experience when you are a level 10 grouped with a level 65.
