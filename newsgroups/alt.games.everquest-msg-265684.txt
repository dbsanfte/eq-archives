If enough people decide they want an X, it really doesn't matter how 
much other content you spread around the game.

Unless the same gear drops from many different mobs... and that would 
work... but then the camps would gravitate towards the easiest of the 
mobs, or the one that spawns the most. (e.g. the various ACyclops camps)

There is *nothing* wrong with being the only adventure in a partiuclar 
dungeon. Instancing doesn't necessarily ruin immersiveness. Instancing 
doesn't even mean that people can't interact with your instance.
