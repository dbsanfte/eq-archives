No big deal but the Orb of Mastery summoned by the lucky mage who 
completed the quest is not "no rent", only lore.  Found that out the 2nd 
day I had it when I automatically tried to summon one when I logged on & I 
couldn't heh.  It doesn't poof. 









 Ok, probbably a stupid question that I should know the answer tto but
> what is an epic?

  Not a stupid question, but with a little research on the web you could 
finally
find an answer to your question. :P

  'Epics' refer to the powerful class-specific particle weapons which were
implemented a while back.  Each class has a quest which is designed to be 
'epic'
in scale, which, when successfully completed, yields a powerful weapon 
that has
a particle effect (i.e. the flaming paladin swords, glowing leaves 
swirling
around the druid scimitar, red skulls emanating from the shadow knight 
blade,
ect.)  The epic weapons aren't usually the BEST weapons available to the
different professions, but most of them have something really nice about 
them (a
powerful proc or a good triggered effect, plus resists and stat boosts) 
and the
weapons which are better than the epics are typically rare drops off uber 
mobs
in uber zones.

  Technically not all of the epics are weapons... the monk epic are 
actually a
really nice pair of gloves, the magician epic is a spell which creates the 
NO
RENT epic weapon itself (which in turn has a triggered effect that creates 
an
awesome pet), the ranger epic is actually two weapons, and the warrior 
epic can
either be one twohanded sword, or split in to two onehanded swords.

  I hope that answers your question. :)
