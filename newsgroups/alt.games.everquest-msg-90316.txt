Well Im very new to Everquest, but I get the impression that corpse runs are
seen as a negative of the game by many?

Personally I like this "burden" of dieing in game. If it was just a case,
like Diablo2 of re-spawning in town with all your gear...the threat of death
would mean little, taking a large amount of spice out of the game.

On another note, I like the time and effort it takes to journey from town to
town. How dull to just appear quickly from one place to another.

Just my two cents worth :)

Pete
