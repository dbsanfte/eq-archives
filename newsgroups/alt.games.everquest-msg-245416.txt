As someone who's been around since the beginning, trust me when I say
that there's always been a lot of bitching about the boats. After the
first time going LD while zoning into Freeport and coming back still
on the boat but headed the wrong way in OOT, it got old real fast.
It's not like the boats EVER worked all that well. There's a reason
that everyone had a port mule back then.
