I made some Fair'dal (sp?) needles, but can't sell them to any vendors.  One
reason I tried them was the reported ability to sell them to vendors.... I
tried in my home city, and then went to the high elf city thinking that only
they may want them.  Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks for any help!
