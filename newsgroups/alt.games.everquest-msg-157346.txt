Okay, let's patch based on timezone.

First, which server(s) are you going to have patched first?

Second, how are you going to prevent people who *have* patched from
logging onto servers that *haven't* been patched, or, how are you
going to prevent people who *haven't* been patched from logging onto
servers that *have* been patched?

Let's suppose that they patch only AB versus everybody else.  So, they
patch AB.  Now, anybody who plays on AB will need to be patched, but,
all those people who live in the Excited States and play on AB *aren't
patched*.  They log into AB, they'll likely have a really exciting
time.  Also, anybody in Europe (I'm assuming that's the clients you'd
be wanting patched) who tries to log into any server other than AB
will be using a patched client to try to log into an unpatched server.
They're gonna have as much fun as the US folks.

Let's try the alternative.  You only patch a person if they play on
the patched server.  So, AB's patched, nobody else is.  You log onto
AB.  As you try to do so, they patch you.  Spiffy.  Now, what happens
if you switch to your character on, say, Nameless?  Do they un-patch
you to Nameless' current state, or do they just let you on and hope
you survive?

There is no choice; every server *must* be patched before *any*
clients are allowed to connect.  And the clients *must* be patched
before they can finish connecting.
