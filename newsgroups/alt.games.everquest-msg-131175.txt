At Level 22, you should have no trouble with the Level 5 to 9 Gnolls in
Blackburrow.  Collecting teeth will be easy.  Also, many people just trash
the teeth and you can ask to collect them yourself.

Also, there is the Kobold Molar quests in the Warrens.  The molars do not
stack, though.  You can collect some bone chips on your way into the Warrens
in the Paineel newbie garden (I go there every once in a while, and after 1
hour, or so, I have a full backpack of chips.

Another possibility, Paludal Caverns.  Fear kite just outside the B1 (at the
Reishi on the path you can grab 4 or 5 single pulls).  Loot is not great,
but the bandits carry sullied weapons and some armor pieces that sell, and
the Patog Fiends carry armor, also.  Not huge money, but some.

There's also Beholder's Maze, Unrest and Befallen (last 2 are better for
you).  Fear Kiting will be difficult in any of these, but you can do it if
careful.  Just darkness then nuke the mobs (ok tap) as hard as possible and
do not let them run far.
