That's why I was saying that the current US policy
seems to be to ask countries to *act*.  Pakistan
isn't being asked to just state that they think
we're swell, they're being asked to actually do
things (provide airspace, ground bases, etc.) that
go far beyond mere words.  They are the sort of things
that would really piss off the terrorists (even as
I write this, the TV news is saying that the Taliban has
just released a saber-rattling statement threatening
Pakistan with retaliation if they help the US).

These are the sorts of things that make a nation sit
down, think real hard, and decide which side of the
fence they really want to stand on.  Either stand
with the US and help us fight terrorism, or stand
with the terrorists and fight the US.  Try to please
everyone and you'll end up pleasing no one.

As the old idiom goes, time to fish or cut bait.
