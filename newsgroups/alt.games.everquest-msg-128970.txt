24 DE rogue, I have about 260 plat (might be able to manage 300) and 
right now I'm carrying a tombcarver and a walrus tooth.  Is there 
anything I should be looking to get next?  I've heard that a ssoy is a 
good weapon to pick up and is much cheaper now that Luclin has come out, 
but I'm having a hard time finding one.  And it's still around 3-400.  
Could I offer the 260 plus the shiny brass idol I have in exchange for 
one?  Nobody seems to know the price of one on E Marr (Cel? Any clue?), 
and if it's only worth, say, 20 like some on allakhazam's claim, I'd 
rather keep it for when I need it, but if it's worth 300, like a few 
other people claim, then, well, I'd rather have the plat at the moment.

Ryou
