Well experience here rocks first of all, and so that is a
high reward, at the levels this dungeon is usually camped,
second he had a chance at any lizardscale items that would
drop in the throne room where we were camping.  There is no
guarantee of rare drops, or otherwise, but there is fine
steel weapons, fair coinage (one of the first dungeons i
remember camping where i would see actually platinum piece
drops, however i didn't do the high pass thing either so
can't say what drops there, i know its popular though).  

It sounds like your saying that it doesn't matter greed is
more important than anything else, I might be mistaken.
