Ok, the test results are in!
[/em pauses to wipe egg off of trollish face and lick up yolks]

The test scenario:
Create two Iksar Shaman and two Vah Shir Shaman. Make one of each have a
stamina of 80, and one of each with a stamina of 100. (These chosen to
find to races where we could make the class and starting stamina exactly
equal to eliminate them as possible contributing factors.)All characters
level one with zero xp. No additional points, etc. put into swimming
skill, so they all had the default swimming skill, which of course puts
the leezards much higher. The test was to simply jump into the water,
sink, not swim at all, and see how long it took to drown.

The results:

Vah Shir STA 80:
started drowning 45 sec
unconscious 55 sec
dead 60 sec

Vah Shir STA 100:
started drowning 75 sec
unconscious 85 sec
dead 90 sec

Iksar STA 80:
started drowning 130 sec
unconscious 140 sec
dead 145 sec

Iksar STA 100:
started drowning 130 sec
unconscious 150 sec
dead 155 sec

Conclusion: Yes, Virginia, our lizard friends get a HUGE benefit in how
long they can hold their breath, no matter how high/low their stamina
is. While the Vah Shir can have a very short maximum breath holding
period with low stamina, and get an increase as stamina improves, it
appears that the Ickies get a default 130 seconds no matter how high or
low it is. The interesting factor is that while the two lizards *began*
to drown in the same amount of time, the higher stamina one was able to
last ten seconds longer before going unconcious. After falling
unconcious, it seems everyone dies five seconds later.

The one remaining factor we were unable to resolve with these level one
characters was the fact that the swimming skill was so much higher. I'm
not sure how to test this, short of finding somebody with a Vah Shir
Shaman who's already advanced far enough to get their swim skill up to
match a default Iksar and drown them. But then, they'd be a much higher
level so I don't know if the test results would be conclusive.

But there you have it. I was dead wrong. Add this to Dan Day's testing
results for any of you archiving such test data. The leezards can
definitely hold their breath a hell of a lot longer, stamina be damned.
