You could try something like this,

/g Run you fools!
/point say looks back at %T
You shall not pass!

This would be seen as

Dareydiel tells the Group Run you fools
Dareydiel looks back to <targets name> (You will be seen to point to point
with your weapon)
Dareydiel says "You shall not pass"

Look in the EQmanual_supplement in your EQ folder for instructions on custom
emotes.

(cutnpasted from said document)

"When creating custom socials, you can now use a series of "%-codes" that
expand into various pieces of information when the social is executed.

The %-codes are:

%M - Returns the character's pet's name (when they have a pet)
%T - Returns the current target.
%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She,
It).
%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her,
It).
%P - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His,
Her, Its).
%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters)."

  Should be done with /g for group say but I'd be wary if you feel you need
to use this HK to much, might want to review the group you are in.

Occasionally I'll roleplay, if others do to me (in a decent manner) then I
will do my best to respond in kind.
Kind of jaded with it all atm.

You seem to enjoy roleplaying so make the character you want to play, not
what you see as most powerful. Yes, necros are the most powerful solo class
in the game but I'd imagine you'd be wasted with one, you're chance to
interact with others is reduced, if only because many people don't realise
how good a decent Necro player can be to a group.
I would definitely suggest the FV server but you might find you bring out
the RP'r in others on your own server.

No, sorry, as a Hybrid class you really don't come into your own until 30th
(IMO) at this point your range of spells makes you more versatile than ever
before, don't get me wrong, 22 is still a nice jump but the one to 30 for a
hybrid is normally the most telling. Many people will say the game doesn't
really start until 50+ or maybe now 55+ but for many the adventures you'll
have between 30th and 50th will be your best (they will be the most
important learning experience for you as you will learn more about your own
and others classes at these levels) and I tend to agree, I like the low 50's
and I'm in no rush to level out of them to 55 and move upto the next teir.
Unfortunately magic items aren't easy to get at low levels but that's not to
say there aren't any available.
What race are you? Verant introduced some nice, low level, armour quests so
you could look at these (should be no problem at your level) they are really
for the 8 - 10 crowd but many of the items you may find better than you have
in some locations.

Try looking at some Websites for quests

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/  is the main one I use.

Try not to lose that RP nature when you hit the 50's, it's rare at those
levels for people to see the game as anything other than a game to be
conquered and not an adventure to be had.
