Im no guru, but I've grouped with many a Wizard and I will continue to
do so..... "Many" were the Nuke Nuke Nuke... med...
but "Many" were very adept at managing their mana.  If anything it was
this cleric causing down time by medding.
I have been in groups where there was 1 tank (good one) and 3 Wizards
and myself..... WE F-ING Rocked!!...  Downtime was minimal, we were
hosing through the creatures in no time at all.....   
I was chain stunning, and the wizards were popping up in turn... each
doing a nuke and .... 
Oh did I say       WE F-ING Rocked!!

You guys that don't like wizards.... bugger off.. and enjoy your
group...   Me, I actually can find something about any class to like.
(I'm not a little bitch like some).  
It is truly the player who makes the game fun  EXP grind or Loot
Grind, or just sitting and chatting.


Wizards Rock...  as do the other classes
