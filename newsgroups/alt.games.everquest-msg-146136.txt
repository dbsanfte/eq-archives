And this is why I used the above, since 51 was a hell level, more xp
to ding, before the patch and isn't now, one would expect a seeming
increase in xp progression. What has happened is a slow down. My
experience above negates the double change. Refer to the showEQ logs
on eqdruids, they match what we are seeing. BTW this is one reason why
they hate showeq. 
SO the question remains what is verant smoking and how do I get some?
