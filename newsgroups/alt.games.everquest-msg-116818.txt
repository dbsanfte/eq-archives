Ya fun to do. Especially if a few in the know are around to mess with the
ones that don't.
One time a target told another his plat was gone and even if the other
target didn't have 5pp on him it came out of his bank account.

Sometimes it can even be fun with someone being targeted who is in the know.

I'll never forget a target emoting me back with
/em feels %T's hand in her pocket
/em feel %T pinch her ass
/slap
/em cuts off %T's fingers.


I never knew some people could type so fast.
