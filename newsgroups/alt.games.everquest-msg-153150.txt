I couldnt agree with you more on the monotheism issue.  I dont advert
my religion for that very reason... If somone asks about my beliefs, I
tend to be rather vague until I know I am not talking with one of
those nut cases.   They are not worth my time in attempting to discuss
the issue, for they are not like reeds in the wind.  I am not out to
Snap anyones stem.
