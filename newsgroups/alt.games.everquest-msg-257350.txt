I flew thru the first three yellow of 50 as normal, but then I started 
replacing the roof on my wife's booth at the renn faire, working 12 hour 
days up in the blazing sun (I normally work 7 hour days in my blacksmith 
shop, a cave-like garage where the only really bright light comes off 
the arc welder, and boy do I have a funny tan, above the gloves and 
below the TShirt), and slowed down markedly.

I did the Taskmaster a few dozen times, along with his buddies; there's 
certainly exp there, but its slow going compared to Dulak.  Poked around 
a few other places but didn't really have the get up and go to figure 
out how to make them work, so it took several days to get a yellow.

Last night I went back to Dulak, started soloing, my enchanter friend 
showed up which dramatically increased my kill rate; she's finally 
getting the program figured out.  Then a little 44 warrior from an 
allied guild came over to get an invis so he could run back out... but 
once I invited him he started killing stuff with us.  Well, thats a 
little dishonest but he's allied and what the heck, he can't be costing 
all that much exp.  Turns out he's twinked to the gills and actually 
increases our kill rate, can soak damage just as well as I can too, but 
his hp regen is noticably lower than mine (he has no regen items other 
than his Fungi tunic, which for the first time I not isn't BER 
wearable), plus he can't keep aggro if I'm stunning, so if he's MT he's 
taking twice as many hits.

Then a guildie cleric is LFG and asks in, other than an initial 
adjustment period where I have to hit him over the head to stop him 
wasting mana healing me this goes pretty well, he melees and nukes and 
generally has a good time getting out of the "sit and heal" doldrums; he 
probably isn't really pulling his weight but the ramping exp bonus for 
larger group sort of makes up for that.

Then he invites a guild SK to come join us, by now I'm getting a bit 
bleary, and the mobs are falling so fast I'm spending a lot of time 
finding the next one; my hp bar actually falls down to 50% because I 
keep clicking off fungal regrowth for pulling and then forgetting to put 
it back on.

My enchanter friend has to log, guild has invited three more people in 
knowing I have to log soon... when they all show up, I disband and go 
back to soloing.  Exp rate climbs, but then slows back down to about 
what the group was feeding me once my friend's haste wears off.

Finally I'm almost to ding, but I'm killing what will be the last mob 
when I get an add.  End up going to zone with my target, snaring him, 
zoning, and coming back to get him again.  Working on him I get an add, 
have to repeat.  This time when I come back in he's regened up to 95%, 
even though last time I zoned out with him at 49% and back with him at 
55%; this time he's gone from 25% to 95%!

Zone back out, go to sleep.  Next morning, wake up, zone in, kill 
nearest scout, ding.  Run to POK, get my little wooden figurine; no 
stats but at least now a place to park my adventurer stone, freeing up a 
storage slot.  Go to trainer, the cap is off Kick (was 149) so I plunk 
all 5 points into that, still chasing the theory that kick skill affects 
intimidate successes.  Lots of other skills just had their caps moved up 
20 or 40 points, so I should get the pleasure of seeing lots of skill 
ups in the next few levels.

Then I log out, come here to post, and now I'm off to the damned roof again.

Grage, 51 Brawler, Luclin
