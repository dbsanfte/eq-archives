I find this to be quite a bit annoying.  I didn't think this running around was
at all necessary and if they wanted to make you do it why couldn't they put the
NPC's in a zone that you could easily get a port to or that has a pok stone in
it?  I don't understand why they continuously put things in that are nothing
but a total waste of time.  Between this and getting the adventurer to give us
our adventure it somehow took my group about an hour and a half to finally get
to the dungeon.  That wasn't fun at all.  
     The dungeon however was great and everything I had hoped for.  We even got
one nice item.  Unfortunately my group got wiped and I didn't get a chance to
do my CR because it was too late and we were about out of time anyway.  We were
fighting in Deepest Guk and my corpse was left there.  Does that mean I'll be
retrieving it from the broken door where we zoned in from Upper Guk?
