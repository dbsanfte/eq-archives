Twisting is the practice of starting a song, stopping and starting
another, stopping and starting another, and so on.  Since the effect
of a song generally lasts at least several seconds, you can gain
the benefit of three or even four songs at once.

Taken from a post by Sean Kennedy:

  What you want is a social for each song slot of the form

  /pause 3, /stopsong
  /cast #
    
  The pauses need to be adjusted for your lag conditions,
  and the # is 1-8 for your songs.

I imagine www.eqdiva.com will have a lot more info.
