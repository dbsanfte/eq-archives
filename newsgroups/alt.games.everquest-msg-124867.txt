    You have missed the point of what we've done, as did many clerics.

    There is no "list" that you join, then go somewhere else and do
tradeskills while waiting for your turn. If you want to be part of "the
list", you go to Skyfire and help keep the clerics there company. You cover
for them when they need to sleep. And then, and only then, you will have
earned the right to be "next" after the clerics already there.

> How do you create the initial list order?

    The clerics that were there after one patch came to an agreement amongst
themselves. No guild leads told them to do this - no sane guild lead with a
fast response force would ever want this. The clerics wanted this. The
clerics were tired of fighting with other people over their epic, and
feeling bad about what should be a happy day in their EQ careers. The
clerics there took back control of their epic quest from the guildleaders
and raid leaders that had made this into such a shithole. It should tell you
something that every major guild on our server has endorsed this, and even
the "rogue" guilds have come around (although not without the threat of the
"big stick" there).

    If you want to stay there and watch until you have all the other pieces
of your epic done, you're welcome to come help. But you might find it
difficult to get XP in Skyfire at level 10. =)

    All the clerics there know the phone number of the "active" cleric. When
Rage pops, and on our server the last few pops have been at 3 AM, the
"active" cleric is phoned and logged in (or a guildmate who knows the active
cleric's password is contacted). Once the active cleric is online, the
people who have been called in take down Ragefire, the loot is randomed
amongst the people called in to help, and there is much rejoicing. Hurray!

everybody

    No, the guilds of the other clerics there come and they take out
Ragefire. They do this for their cleric, and because they know when their
cleric's turn comes the same courtesy will be extended to them.

    We have yet to have someone be away and unreachable when Ragefire comes.
If something like that happened, I imagine the heart would go to the next
cleric after the "active" cleric, and the active cleric would resume his
position when he gets back. But given that clerics are told about the time
committment this takes up front, I see it as unlikely.

> consecutive slots on the list?  If not, why not?

    If those clerics are all willing to sit in Skyfire every time they log
on, for as long as they're on, or can get someone to sit in for them, then
they get slotted in. Having to spend that sort of time out there is what's
stopping hordes of clerics from coming out and making a monster wait.

> What can you *really* do to a guild that opposes this list?

    Contest every gnoll they want killed. Given the sheer number of manaburn
wizards the top guilds on my server can muster, that is no idle threat. Read
Graffe's - one server is on the verge of taking down Sontalak with a dozen
Manaburn wizards. If my guild sent two groups to do what a mid-level guild
wanted to do, and the other big guild sent two groups, and some of the
smaller guilds sent three groups, that rogue guild would not win any
roll-offs the GMs would mandate and would starve for targets.

    And that's just the "official" response a rogue guild could expect. As a
cleric, if I heard of any guild doing this I'd never res one of their
members again. And most of the clerics I know would feel the same. How far
would most people get if every cleric they met shunned them?

    The clerics have. Ragefire must be your last step for your epic. No
"getting the heart for later". And that's it, beyond putting in the time.

can

    If they don't want to become social pariahs and scorned by the single
most crucial class in all of Everquest, they'll go along with it. If they
choose to screw over every cleric that ever hoped for a peaceful, happy
completion to their epic then fuck them and the horse they rode in on -
they'll get exactly what they deserve for making the game miserable.

    As I said, we aren't a small guild. We can spare the 12 people required
to shadow another guild and kill anything they want. So can the other big
guilds on the server. Even the mid-sized guilds would support such an
action, as they are the major benefactors of the new system. More of them
have gotten epics since the new system was put in place than ever before,
because now larger guilds don't parachute in the moment Ragefire pops and
take him for cleric recruit #24.

    Guess our smaller guilds actually realized that this was *good* for
them. As for the large guilds, they like the fact that instead of creating
ill will by steamrolling some innocent cleric that had been waiting
patiently for an ungodly amount of time, they can instead help their clerics
watch the camp and clear Ragefire and be seen as helpful. It's win-win.
