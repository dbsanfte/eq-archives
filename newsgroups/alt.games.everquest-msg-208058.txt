Vah Shir were the first race to get these quests, not the last.

Each class has a series of class specific quests leading up to the Sonic 
Wolf Bane Weapon and a further series of items after that (in fact as 
far as I know there are still levels of this quest that haven't been 
completed), in addition to which there's a nice series of armor quests, 
admittedly generic to all Vah Shir but quite decent for any class that 
isn't being twinked.

Come to think of it, the Curscale quest is sort of like this for Iksar, 
although not nearly as detailed or interesting
