Yes on max mana (INT = more mana)
No on regn (you need Flowing Thought items/spells)
No on cast times (you need focus items)
No on mem times (Spell Lvl vs. Char level makes this go by faster)
No on scribe times (sames as mem times)

Try this:

Exhaust your mana, take off all you INT gear, sit and med to full.  Stand up
and then put on all you gear to see how much mana you get from it. You'll be
surprised i bet.
