I just purchased this card this weekend, and I'm having problems
with it.  It works fine for every other directX game I have, so I
know the card/drivers/directX are installed correctly.  It even
works for the Everquest tutorial.  Here is where it kicks out,
after selecting the server, right before the music starts playing
with the Fironia Vie - Everquest loading screen.  The error is
with the EQF??-7DX file, the ?? are unknown I didn't write down
the file name.  I already sent an email off to Sony, but most of
the time you guys know the game better than they do, so does
anyone know how, or have any suggestions on how to fix this?  I
have already:

Reinstalled EQ
Tried using the DX drivers that came with the card
Tried using the DX drivers on the Velios CD
Tried downloading new drivers(but I could only find V8a so I
didn't)
Tried using old card drivers
Tried using the newest card drivers
Tried using the TNT genaric card drivers

Thank you for any help you can give.
JB
