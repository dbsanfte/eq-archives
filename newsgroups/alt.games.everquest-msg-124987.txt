}When giving things to NPC's and doing tradeskills, don't stack things, there
}may be some exceptions but I can't think of any.

It is usually ok, when handing stackable quest items directly to an NPC, 
to have stacks of up to 4 items.  This doesn't apply in a combine 
container quest, of course.  And it can be irritating suddenly getting 16 
copies of Smite in your inventory. :)

Still, if it's anything much more valuable than a bone chip, better 
unstack it just to be safe. :)
