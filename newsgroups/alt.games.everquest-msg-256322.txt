I believe dex is also tied to a bards singing.

Only ever cast this if asked, not worth the buff slot even on warriors imo.

Fairly nice for ldon considering the traps etc, I tend to use the longer
lasting version rather than the higher level one.

Dont really need sow in an ldon, maybe in 65 hards I guess.

HP > All, always keep if you dont have max sta.

Also click off any mind buffs, they dont help a bard, any attack buffs
(beastlord / ranger ones), your melee is not why you are there.

Click off any damage shield, you dont really need it as shouldnt be getting
hit too much.

That should give you enough free buff slots (remember its good to keep at
least 3 open, 1 for heal over time, 1 for your proc, and 1 for any  debuff
you may recieve.
