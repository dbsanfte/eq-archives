    I had the bug (although I recognized it before I died and didn't lose
the levels), so I can tell you about the restore process the GM used with
me.

    First, because I hadn't died, the GM did a /kill on me. That sent me
from 3.7 yellows into 64 to one death below max XP in 60. He then did a 100%
GM res on my body, which sent me to 100% XP in 60 and confirmed the bug. He
then gave me XP to put me at level 65, and chain-/kill'ed me until I was
back where I started (plus a little bit as an apology for taking two days to
help me, thank you Mr. GM! =) ). No possibility of item loss whatsoever.

    The person who started all the public pressure to get this fixed was a
guildmate, Xaxilis (posts on EZ-Board as Darkfa11). He lost one yellow in 61
to the bug. At the end of all this, a GM logged him on and gave him the one
yellow. The funny thing was he was left flagged as a GM by accident since
Quellious crashed soon afterwards. It was funny seeing him do a /broadcast
saying "Hi, I'm flagged as a GM and I shouldn't be, could I be fixed
please?"

    If you are requesting a character restore, I would strongly advise
against handing over large amounts of anything to anyone. The GMs will check
to see if you're doing something like that beforehand, and would likely
regard such actions as attempts to dupe items.

    James
