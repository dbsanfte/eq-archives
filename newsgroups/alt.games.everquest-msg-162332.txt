	Endless Quiver is not "stupid".  It is, in fact, 100% necessary.

	Do you have *any idea* how many arrows a Ranger goes through?

	Since I get the impression that you're complaining that EndQ takes
business away from fletchers, let me mention here that I am a skill 209
fletcher who made most of his platinum in the first two years or so of the
game's existence selling his products.  Let me also mention that I've had a
Tolan's Bracer for a very long time and the arrows it produced were pretty
much the only ones I used -- because I simply could not keep myself supplied
with better ones.  I would have had to pay someone real money to sit at a
computer and do fletching in EQ to keep myself supplied.  The amount would
have to include a generous allowance for the medical care required to treat
this hypothetical individual's RSI.  I am, of course, only discussing the use
of arrows produced by store-bought components, as it would be completely
impossible to farm enough acrylia for better ones.  (Actually I think there's
a mithril arrow usable by non-Tunare sorts comparable to acrylia, but I refuse
to use them on general principles.)  There aren't enough PC fletchers in the
game to keep even just the Hunter-level Rangers in arrows, and finding
inventory space for the ammo needed for Velious or Luclin raid targets would
be (and was for many) a real challenge.  (A Ranger discussing this very topic
on the Glade recently said he went through 20 to 40 STACKS of arrows in a
typical Aaryonar fight.)

	Simply put, if Rangers are to use their bows as weapons (and not stat
jewelry that lets you pull), EndQ must function as it currently does.
