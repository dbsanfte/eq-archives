No, but I'm sure you could use a virtual machine/emulator partition. .
.unfortunately, you're:

1. Using a buggy, non-native OS,
2. Running an emulator,
3. Running EQ, which uses as much CPU time as it can.

Translation: your performance is going to be piss-poor.  If you can't bear
to have a Windows PC, dual-boot your Linux box with a small Windows
partition.

Who wonders why people don't use a sensible free *NIX like FreeBSD.  *grin*
