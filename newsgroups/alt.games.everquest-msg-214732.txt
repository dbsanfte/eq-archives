Actually, I would argue the reverse, at least for a non-twink.  Given
the ready availability of stat boosting items in the game the only
time your starting stats are really important is when you're starting.
Ignoring L1 to L9 as they've been gimped almost out of existence, I'd
say the key levels to consider are 10 to 40 or so.  Of course, as a
Shaman you're gonna spend well over half that time with canni in your
spellbook, and before you get canni you do have adequate melee, so I'd
still be one of those who advocate STA over WIS.
