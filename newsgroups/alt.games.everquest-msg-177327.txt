Rogues are the only class that can be invisible to undead and live
creatures at the same time with their hide/sneak ability. This is a
really handy ability and can be very useful for corpse retrieval.

Warriors in EQ really need a lot of support from other classes. I
think very few players start out their first character as a warrior.
It's a class that is so dependent on gear that usually people will
start a warrior after they have another higher level character that
can twink some decent items to the warrior character.
