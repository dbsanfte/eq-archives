And just a little too much to expect from true noobs.

The OP's story went something like this.

"I'm a highschooler playing in the sand box at the park. I'm making a
big sand castle. There's only enough room for me. Once my castle is
built I'll go away though. Then these little 4th graders came in and
without saying as much as hello, started making their own sand castle,
when there was plainly only enough room for mine. So I tried to get
them to leave, but they wouldn't, so I stepped on their sand castle
and kicked sand in their eyes. That'll tech 'em. Payback is great."
