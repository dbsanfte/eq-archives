Given that some pre-Kunark druids used to porcupine into their 40s (in
Oggok iirc),  I'd say you're wrong on that. Not sure if the ogres
there were a special case for some reason or not, never had a druid
that high lvl. Probably not worth trying with mobs from the later
expansions since those tend to hit harder but given current gear and
old world dungeons, I get the feeling a druid could procupine to 59 in
L Guk or Sol B.
