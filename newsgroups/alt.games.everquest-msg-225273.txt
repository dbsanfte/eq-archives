Well - so far I've only used my mage charm against names and tower bosses.

In that context - we always arrange it as a group effort - ranger ensnares,
I malosinia, 'chanter tashes (sometimes) then I grab it.  I've only had two
early breaks doing this so far, and I captured him inside 4 seconds (I
have EQ watcher looking for the charm break message, then it gives me a
VERY audible warning)  I have a hotkey -

CHARM BREAK CHARM BREAK CHARM BREAK
Attempting to recapture %t - watch my health please
/cast 8
/cast 8
/cast 8

In addition I keep him targeted most of the time - In order to send him 
into the attack I /assist MA, /pet kill, ctrl-t (to swap back).  I always
make sure he was my last target when I switch to DS, Nuke, Malosinia or
/pet kill.

Also - I've charmed once without prior debuffing - he broke INSTANTLY, the
only instant break I've had.  I really believe that debuffing is a key to
it.

I can't wait to finally get Elemental Silence - faster casting than charm
and it will allow me to re-debuff.
