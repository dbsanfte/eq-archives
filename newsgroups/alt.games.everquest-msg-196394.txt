Half elves in leather with the new models are not particularly more
provocative than half elves in leather with the old models.  They're
both quite provocative, however. I hasten to note the inclusion of the
word "pretty much everything" in my message.  I will acknowledge that
some leather outfits with the new models are more outrageous, gnome
skin being chief among them.  I think monochromatic outfits are more
provocative with the new models, but for polychromatic outfits,
there's no real difference.

The new cloth model, despite the ample amount of skin shown, is a
great deal more modest than the old model.

Chain, eh, the new models don't have those revealing gaps in certain
places, but the old chain models weren't exactly provocative.

Plate's not as form fitting as it used to be.
