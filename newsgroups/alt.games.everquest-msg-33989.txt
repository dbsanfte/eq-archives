  If I were still playing EQ, I'd play on the RP server, probably
exclusively, though possibly I'd also play on the PvP servers (presuming
the RP server wasn't also PvP.)  Though since EQ isn't really designed
very well to facilitate roleplay, so I doubt an EQ RP server would be
anything more than a moderate success.

  I left EQ partially because it didn't satisfy the roleplayer in me. 
I'm playing another game right now that does, but lately I've been
wanting mix it up with some PvP (RP can be boring, after all, if you
don't have some tangible way to RP conflict... verbal sparring matches
get old after a while), but the game I'm presently playing has very
restrictive PvP guidelines.

  I'm hoping Shadowbane or one of the other upcoming games with satisfy
the RPer, the "video game player", and the PvPer in me, but until and
unless that happens, I guess I'm just going to have to bounce around
between games that satisfy my urges and fancies on an individual basis. 
One game that has the whole package would be great, but it just hasn't
happened yet and perhaps never will.

  I do think an attempt at creating an EQ RP server would be a good
thing, and it wouldn't be an impossible task, as some seem to think.  It
wouldn't be perfect, there'd still be OOC junk and behavior that would
require roleplayers to stretch their suspension of disbelief, but with a
few simple measures, I think it would be relatively easy to create a
server that most people inclined to RP would find an atmosphere more
conducive to roleplay.  If I never happens though, I don't think it'll
be any great tragedy.
