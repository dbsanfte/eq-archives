No but it affects the raid group functionality. Designated looters is
a huge deal and sometimes raid xp can be fairly decent. Not to mention
the order it helps to bring the raid. All other things being equal the
raids go so much smoother with pop than without it. We use it a lot
when going into dungeons with 9 or 10 people in two groups. As for
open raids wouldnt touch one NOT using pop raid functions. No pop?
Sorry you need to get it. Right or wrong thats the way it is.
