After buying EQ a couple of weeks ago, both myself and my son have became
hopelessly addicted
I am interested in playing EQ with my son as group. At the moment we share
the account, so we can only play turns each.

The current plan is to buy another copy, he will play from his PC thru a 56k
and will I play through ADSL.

The question is; can we share the ADSL line if I get the right kit. Do i
need to buy another ADSL modem, or can one be shared. If I need to get a
second modem I presume it is still possible for both computers to use the
same ADSL connection and account.

Anyone who is kind enough to offer advice could you please copy to my email
as well as posting to the NG as my ISP never gets all of the posts

thanks

Barry
