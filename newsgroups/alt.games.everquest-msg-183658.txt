Im actually really suprised. Once the servers were up, our server
(Cazic Thule) only went down once on the first day (while I was on
anyways). I must say Im impressed too. I scoffed at the notion we were
going on a voxx raid last night - but it went well and she went down
(and not the server).

I have noticed a few oddities about dying. Seems that on each char, at
least one slot refused to dye. Sometimes it was legs, other times was
hands.. etc and it was different on each char. Sometimes it was a slot
with an item that had an intrinsic color already and sometimes it was
a plain item. I however didnt try another item in the slot to test.

Also, a few wizards who had the expansion that went with us couldnt
zone into Gunthak. They claimed they had all the downloads and so on,
but couldnt zone in.

Im still terrified to put anything in the new bank slots. 

By the way, has anyone been to any new zones other than Gulf of
Gunthak (was that the name of it?) or Nadox? Didnt go really far into
Nadox so didnt get a chance to explore alot of it.
