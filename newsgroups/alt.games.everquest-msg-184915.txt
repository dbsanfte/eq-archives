If your guild does Luclin and PoP, then move directly to 65, do not
pass Go, do not collect 20 aa points.

Do you have, or can get, Command of Tunare? Do you have, or can get
access to the Plane of Storms? If yes to both, aa points will come
flowing. I dinged 65 a month ago. Since then I went from 42 to 89 aa
points, mostly through charm killing. Frogs are heavily camped but
when they're available you can get 8-9% aa per kill at 65.

If you don't have access or your guild isn't doing PoP, then perhaps
it's not worth it.  If you can't get into BoT you're not likely to get
many 63+ spells (some of which are very nice indeed). Of the 61-62
spells, I only use Fury of Ro with any reguarlity.
