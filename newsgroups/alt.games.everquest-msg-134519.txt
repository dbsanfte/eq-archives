> One thing I *really* like...I can finally move the spell/song-timer
window.

I quit for over a year and have just returned.  Is there now a timer window
for spells? And if so, how do I see it? (In the old UI at least).  All types
of things that I'm finding out now.  I just found out that you don't need to
stare at the spell book when medding and can now actually watch the fight.
