AHHAHA yeah, and to say "MR (whatever that guys name was.. I forgot)"

That guy is a darn good actor though, I was impressed. At first I was
thinking of him being in the Matrix but by the time he was with
isudrel or whatever urging him what to do with the ring I'd kind of
forgotten that and he seemed pretty bad assed and quite a fitting
elrond. They did a good job of casting odd looking people as some
elves ;)

I'm reading the two towers now.. could not wait until the next movie
came out to reread it ;) I'm wondering how they will do treebeard and
the ents? I'm really hoping against hope that they don't edit that out
or shorten it too much like they did the Tom bombidil or whatever that
guy's name was in the first film =/ The whole treebeard and other
trees and his flashback to the entwives and their singing could really
kick butt if done right.
