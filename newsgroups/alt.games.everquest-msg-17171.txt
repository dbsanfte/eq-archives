It's this thing called "courtesy". I find it rude. And, hell, I'm even
annoyed by people that send me tells the moment I walk into the zone
asking if I wanna group. If I wanna group I'll either 1) /ooc LFG or
2) respond to your /ooc "group looking for more". But, that part isn't
something I get too upset over.

Also...if you ask me if I wanna group, and I don't respond, that's a
no...
