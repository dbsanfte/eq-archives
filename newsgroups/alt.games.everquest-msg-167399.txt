I have been playing EQ for almost 2 years and just hit level 50 with
my 4th character and have several more in the mid to high 40's.

My characters in the 50's range from 50 to 55. I would like to play
the high end game but I can't figure out how to get there.

My current guild doesn't hunt the Planes and only raids once a month
if even that. I have checked into several other guilds that do raid on
a regular basis but I don't meet their level requirements.

It has become difficult to find groups in many of the higher zones and
I have been dual boxing but even that has become very difficult due to
the high hp of the mobs and the slow exp due to downtime.

How do I continue to gain decent exp and move on in the game?

I have found that I have 2 options dual boxing. Zones with light blue
and low blue mobs ( bad exp but no downtime) or zones with higher
level mobs (good exp but lots of downtime = slow exp).

Playing a single character I tried lfg in several zones last night. KC
had 6 people, PoI had 2 people, Seb had 9 people. No luck finding a
group and spent the better part of a hour going from zone to zone.

I see lots of 60 plus characters running around so I'm guessing I'm
just going about this the wrong way. Any advice?
