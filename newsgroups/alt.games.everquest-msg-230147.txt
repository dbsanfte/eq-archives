My usual pattern, pulling a room with 5 mobs, A through E, with A furthest
from entrance - Lull C, Lull B, Lull A, Target D, Target E; Bellow E; run to
group chased by D and E; hit "Inc %T, Assist me Now" Hotkey; enter room with
group; watch for first swing from MT (ensuring he's on E); toggle to Target
D and Mezz, twist and shout as appropriate.  If I'm pretty sure I can get a
charm to work, I'll charm D and add his unslowed DPS to E, which also
prevents the healers from building heal-aggro on D - when charm breaks, all
he remembers is me, which is as it should be. I've never had a complaint -
but after reading elsegroup today, I'm going to start stocking throwing
knives to pull with instead of Bellow.

JMO; YMMV
