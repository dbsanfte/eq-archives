Enchanters are actually fairly easy to beat while dueling . Every single
spell in the arsenal is a magic based spell. Get a really good *GEAR* magic
resistance . A very low dammage dot to break mez every 6 seconds also helps
. Another of the enchanters great weaknesses is that he can not kill you
quickly . An enchanters most dammaging force by far is a pet. If they are
stuck with dots and dds then they are in trouble . They win through avenues
that other people just do not understand. If an enchanter can neutralize
everything you do eventually the crappy attack will finnish you off :p

Shamans are the most dangerous opponets. Necromancers , druids , and wizards
fall right behind them .
