How often do you die? =) Staying away from death is about the best thing you
can do for your exp. Fight only blues and the occasional even. (Unless
groups, then find what you can pull constantly and not have any downtime.)
My monk went from 12 to 20 in a week of only playing him for one or two
hours a night. (I'd normally just play him until he leveled. ;)

As for 50+ .. It *is* bad. The soloists (druids, necros mainly) get the
shaft because of the downtime. I added 10 days /played to get from 52 to 53.
Mostly because I was running around doing other things. ;) I was able to get
into a good group one day in Sebilis (Crypt, which isn't all that great exp
compared to other camps) and made 12 blues of level 54 there. Was quite
amazing since 54 is the hell of all hells that I've faced so far. =P

Something I've noticed, though. It really makes a difference for the lower
levels who are soloing. Old-world mobs have less hp and don't hit as hard as
Kunark mobs. My monk went from being able to solo black/yellow mobs in Oasis
to having to FD off a medium blue in Ill Omen. The *LOW* blues there can
still drain me by a bub or two.

Then let's talk about Velious. VI gave us better weapons and better armor,
so they had to give the mobs a better chance. The mobs here have more hp and
hit harder than your average same-level Kunark mob. I'm talking about things
that are green to me (level 39 or so) hitting for 110's. Solusek Kobolds in
Sol B are similar or higher level and hit for 90's tops iirc.

The stuff in Kunark and Velious may give better exp than old-world stuff,
but if you're soloing, the old-world stuff is the way to go. =)
