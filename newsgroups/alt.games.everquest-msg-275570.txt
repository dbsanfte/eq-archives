I'm looking for a guild on Morell-Thule with people interested in 
tradeskills, maybe even a sort of co-op.  (My old guild was disbanded...) 
If you know of an existing option, I'd love to hear about it.  Also, if you 
would be interested in forming a new guild with me, send me (Frinka) an in 
game email.

Thanks!
Frinka
Morell-Thule
