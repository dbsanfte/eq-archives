Perhaps I'm badly misinformed (never ran or seriously twinked a
tank class far enough to get the equipement to experiment with)
but I don't think regen effects off items stack, I believe you
merely get your best regen effect

The fact that there is no simple way to swap equipement around
en masse, tehn, won't be all that crippling.

Fastest swap would be to sacrifice two hotkey positions; one
with a general inventory slot, one with your swap body position
(almost certainly chest)

Now, its click on Sit hotkey (you do have one of those don't you?)
Click on inventory, click on slot.

Most people will tell you to also click on inventory again, but
that's not necessary; hold your Combat item in your hand till
you are ready to fight again, and keep the cursor centered over
the slot hotkey.

If a fight breaks out, click on stand, click on slot, click on inventory.

Thats six clicks for the whole magilla, you could cut it even
smaller -if- you never use your cursor for targetting during a
fight... always have your regen item or your combat item
on the cursor.
