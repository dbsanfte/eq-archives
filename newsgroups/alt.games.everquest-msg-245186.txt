Was someone in your group rooting mobs?  The aggro rules for rooted mobs is
simply the closest person wins.

Often monks/rogues will have problems with lazy tanks and proximity or
rooted aggro.  There are differences in how far away you can stand and still
hit the mob.  The tank should always get as close as possible to the mob.

2hand weapons and swords have a longer reach than h2h and daggers.  Also a
troll has more reach than a halfling
