Previously no challenge to EQ has ever come in the form of EQs own 
literal successor. As much as Sony pay lip service to the idea that EQ2 
is a different game... they still named it *Everquest 2*. Your only 
deluding yourself if you think management thinks they will be equals, 
side by side.

Until now EQ was the crown jewel in SOEs software portfolio. It has 
likely already lost that position to EQ2 in the minds of management. 
Things are going to change for the worse; the only question is how 
quickly.

Subscriptions filter out a large segment of the potential player base 
and always will. I'd play DAoC, AO, EVE, and other games on a quasi 
regular basis if i wouldn't be paying 10+ bucks each title for the 1-3 
days a month I'd play.

DAoC caters to a crowd EQ entirely fails at: RvR PvP.

Server Mergers need to come sooner than later. Changing the way the game 
operates will not solve the problem for an uberguild that can't field 
more than 20 members.

Sometimes when the little boy cries wolf... there's a wolf.
