I have to say, I hate you. :)

The dagger is 300pp on Karana and being a raged-slot item, goes in one of the 3
slots I have no WIS item for, which, for a druid, is unthinkable <grin>

You may like LOIO a bit better in the low to mid 20's (die less, exp more) till
you can exp at the mountain giant fort in Frontier Mountains next door, where
the pp and high-vendor-value items flow freely like wine at a banquet.
