Still, I would tend to agree that they wouldn't be repeating the
hardest work done to create the expansion, such as modeling, creating
the dungeons, creating the instanced-dungeons code, creating the
storyline, etc...

Assuming you do have to name some new mobs...so what.  You could
literally do this with one person and a few hours in front of a
database.  Creating new levels for mobs could take time, with possible
new spell lists, resists, melee stats, flags, aggro messages,
etc...but still this should really be cake compared to actually
creating the mobs from scratch, let alone the entire expansion.
