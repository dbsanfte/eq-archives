Well, if as you said at least one officer was there, that seems to cast
doubt on the guild as a whole...

When you also say "> I think one person claims the guild leader was there on
another character."

If thats true.. well how much more could a guild endorse such a thing?
I mean sure its not good to judge a group on an individual, but as an
officer or guild leader you have a lot more to answer for, and a bigger job
of representing your guild

Any reasons why they did this?   Have the guild been pharming the warders
for a while now and pretty much done with ST loot?
