Thanks for the tip about wolf form.  I'd have surely wolfed up as soon as I
zoned in and died a miserable death. :-)

I'd be root/dotting for sure.  Was in PoD earlier, and tried root/dotting
the flies (they were the only things I felt comfortable pulling).  It was
difficult to find a good spot to pull to, as the rats kept wanting a piece
of the action, too.

And when they took a bite out of my puppy butt, it hurt.

Thanks again, Horus.
