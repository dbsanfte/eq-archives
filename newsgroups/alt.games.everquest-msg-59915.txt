This was my understanding as well, just making it clear that Green mobs
are now all no-exp, and blue mobs are where they used to be, but now
those errant green-but-exp are instead marked as Cyan.  Now if they
would just mark the lowest two or three levels of Red as Orange, so
I could tell the difference between "ideal prey" and "your spells won't stick
to these" I'd be really happy.... my interest in killing cyan or even blue
mobs being minimal as a 30 druid.  On the other hand, at 53, Cyan means
soloable for a cleric!
