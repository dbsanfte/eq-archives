I don't think it was so much necessary from a "the mobs are too 
powerful" standpoint, so much as from a "paladins and SK are so much 
better at this that warriors are dead as a class" standpoint.

General consensus was that warriors' limited taunting ability meant that 
everyone grouped with them as MT had to scale back in order to ensure 
they kept aggro.  If this translated to a 20% reduction in group damage 
output, then that meant taking a warrior instead of a knight meant 
getting exp and loot 20% slower.

It doesn't matter if you are facing mobs that will kill the mage in one 
round if he takes aggro off you, or if you are facing pansies  that he 
can off tank for three or four rounds without bothering to back up; in 
the long run he doesn't want the aggro either way (cleric shouldnt' be 
wasting mana healing someone wearing tissue paper for armor) and so his 
question is "how much do I have to not nuke in order to let the tank 
keep control?"

Since you don't take a warrior for his damage output (take a DPS class 
for that) the only reason to take him is for his tanking... if he's 20% 
worse at that than the other two plate classes, why take him at all?  If 
Knights are less desirable as tanks, at least they offer heals, buffs, 
stuns... or snare, buffs, FD.  Warriors, on the other hand, had nothing, 
and couldn't even serve in the traditional second tank position of 
quickly grabbing aggro on adds.

Splendid
