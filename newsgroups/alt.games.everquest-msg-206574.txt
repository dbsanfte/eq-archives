I found a great trick from the cleric boards. By going in one of the
back entrances from Sol A into Sol B (the one that comes out by the Nox
spider spawn) You can levitate up a lava tunnel and get to the Zordack
vendor without needing help fighting in. Getting SOE and a port to
lavastorm from a friendly druid helps. You might agro a bat or 2 so
bring a few invis potions.
