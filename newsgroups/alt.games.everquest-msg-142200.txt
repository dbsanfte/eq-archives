My feeling is that the RIAA can hear their death-bell ringing, and are
trying to take as many others with them as they can.

Pity, too. There's a real opportunity for them with the Internet if
only they'd quit squabbling amongst themselves, pull their heads out
of the sand, and do something about it.


The time is coming when musicians will need the RIAA less and less.
Already a regular person can set up a digital studio, create an album,
master it to CD and sell either MP3s or CDs from their own web site,
and for not all that much money up front, either.

Personally, I'm looking forward to the eventual crash of the RIAA.
Their stranglehold is long overdue for breaking.
