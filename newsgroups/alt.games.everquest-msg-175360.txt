yesterday was a difficult day. I don't see any clouds in the sky again, i'm
sure that doesn't mean anything important, food can be grown hydroponically
anyway and i'm sure that water can come from the ocean through a
desalination process. I'm just calling it how I see it, I don't think God is
very pleased with you anymore. The Super bowl is coming soon too, oh well
maybe the Raiders will win next year.

I may be arrested for doing this some day, but I have no compunctions being
arrested in defense of the Constitution of the United States of America and
the Christian religion this country was founded on, that is actually a very
favorable position to be in, the right side because then at least you have a
foundation you can draw strength and encouragement from.
