"We don't plan on releasing detailed mechanics - Some things people should
really discover for themselves as part of normal gameplay.  The goal was to
smooth the path from 30 to 50, not to make it require less overall gameplay,
or happen faster.  The intent wasn't to get people from 30 to 50 any faster.  

The overall path isn't any easier to reach level 50 -- a retroactive
experience boost wouldn't really be called for.   Down the line of what I
said at the last fan faire, "If we did something with hell levels, we would
have to find a fair solution that didn't affect anyone's existing experience
or progress."
